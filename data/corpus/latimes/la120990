<TEXT>
<P>
The honorable pursuit of professions has been one foundation of our 
civilization over the centuries. But beyond that solid virtue, a cleansing 
grace attaches to those who, from within each profession, ask questions about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
There is the professional soldier who knows how much defeat lies in victory. 
The lawyer who knows how much injustice lies in the legal pursuit of justice. 
The journalist who knows how partial a truth is uncovered by his methods. The 
doctor who knows how life can be marred and insulted by the medical 
requirements for preserving it. 
</P>
<P>
Such supra-professional questioning may not often raise the practice of the 
profession but -- like the saints who haven't yet managed to drastically 
elevate the quality of bishops -- it encourages the rest of us. And it has 
produced some wonderfully good writing. 
</P>
<P>
In medicine, for instance, there are the examples of Oliver Sacks and, 
particularly, of Lewis Thomas. They use the essay form for their stretching and 
questioning. So, in the past, has Richard Selzer, a retired surgeon and 
professor at the Yale School of Medicine. Now Selzer has taken another step in 
the humane expansion of his original discipline by writing a collection of 
brief fictions. 
</P>
<P>
There is a writer in the doctor; we knew that. More interesting, there is a 
doctor in the writer. That may seem a truism; what else would you expect when a 
doctor writes? In fact, it is two stages beyond. 
</P>
<P>
In the best of these tales, Selzer has transformed himself entirely, if not 
quite untraceably, into the fiction writer. And back from this graceful fiction 
blows a breath of healing. Imagine a doctor whose medicines have improved the 
patient's body without quite bringing him to health, playing the cello to 
perform the final cure of re-attachment to life. 
</P>
<P>
The image is a little excessive. So is some of Selzer's writing, and in the 
same way. It over-makes its point; it over-arranges. As if intoxicated with the 
writer's power to make things as beautiful as he can, the author sometimes 
makes them too beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
He does so, I think, in "Luis," a soft tale of a slum child in Brazil who finds 
a "star" in a garbage dump, and who dies from the radiation given off by what, 
in fact, is a carelessly discarded hospital isotope. Another story, "Poe's 
Lighthouse," is a narrative by a madman who discovers an unspeakable evil in 
the base of a lighthouse. It announces horror without drawing us into it, as 
Poe could do. 
</P>
<P>
Radiation sickness, madness; the other tales each use a different medical 
phenomenon as a point of departure. They are not about the illness or the 
procedure; they are about an aspect of the human spirit suggested or affected 
by them. 
</P>
<P>
"Whither Thou Goest" is, ostensibly, about organ transplants. In fact -- its 
crooked comedy bestrides its haunting message like a circus clown shambling up 
onto a horse and giving a bravura ride -- it is about the mined frontier 
between human life and the practices of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Hannah's husband is shot by a vagrant while helping an old woman change a flat 
tire. The doctors persuade her to discontinue his futile life-support system, 
and let them harvest his vital parts. "Harvest?" she asks. "Like the gathering 
in of wheat?" Thinking it over, she looks down at the chief doctor's feet. "He 
was wearing oxblood wing-tip shoes of a large size. They were the shoes of 
power." 
</P>
<P>
She gets a letter thanking her. Sam's liver is working nicely in Abilene, the 
kidneys in Dallas and Galveston, the lungs in Fort Worth, the corneas in 
Houston, the heart near the Arkansas border. "She already knew what had become 
of the rest of Sam. She had buried it in the family plot of the Evangelical 
Baptist Church cemetery." 
</P>
<P>
But she is bewildered and unhappy. Is she really a widow when so much of Sam is 
alive? Widowhood would be better than "the not-here, not-there conditions into 
which she had been brought by the miracle of modern science." 
</P>
<P>
She needs to do something. She decides to visit, and writes to the farmer who 
has Sam's heart. Angry letters come back from the wife, but one day when the 
wife is away, the farmer asks her to come. Feeling like a bride-to-be, she 
goes, and for an hour, listens to her husband's heart in the farmer's chest. At 
the end he asks timidly if she'll be back. "No need," she says. The dignity of 
life's end had been abused; somehow, Hannah's quest restores it. 
</P>
<P>
Does medicine, seeking to prevent or postpone death, belittle life by denying 
death's place in it? The question is posed with extraordinary beauty in the 
title story. No medicine will help the narrator; she has contracted AIDS from a 
bisexual lover. She goes to stay at a pension in a French village near Annecy, 
on the lake. 
</P>
<P>
There she writes a letter in the form of a journal. It recounts the daily 
graces of a civilization which, at its best, knows more about the small details 
that nourish life than any other. 
</P>
<P>
Dying, she is an honored guest of Mme. Durand, who runs the pension; of the 
servants and waitresses, of the gardener, and of the neighbors who come in the 
late afternoons to have an aperitif on the terrace. For every symptom, there is 
not a medicine but a garland. 
</P>
<P>
Her legs begin to fail, and the gardener fashions a walking stick out of a 
grapevine. She develops shingles; Mme. brings her a loose Arab robe for 
comfort. A neighbor drinks a glass of the local wine with her; another drives 
her down to the lake to sit in a cherry orchard. She is carried out to lie in 
the sun on a stone wall looking over the water. Crusty bread and a fresh 
speckled egg -- all she can eat -- are served her. When her hands swell up, she 
is driven to a bee farm. After two bee-stings the swelling subsides. It is the 
"bees' milk," she is told. 
</P>
<P>
"Nicole and Mme. together disinterred me from the bed and brought me forth for 
an airing," she writes one day. "Where did they learn this profound courtesy 
for the flesh?" 
</P>
<P>
It is an extraordinary phrase. The courtesy for the flesh is the most ancient 
of healings, and it works when medicines fail -- not to prevent death but to 
make dying a worthy part of life. 
</P>
<P>
Selzer has delivered a message that could easily fall into sentimentality, with 
an astonishing, exhilarating precision. It was an artist's decision to set the 
story where he does. His villagers represent at its most ideal the French way 
of treating life; but it is an authentic representation. 
</P>
<P>
And when death comes, it is a small, unforced step. One day in the autumn, 
Nicole no longer brings up breakfast. She no longer sets out the daily fresh 
napkin in the narrator's place at table. The narrator is able to record this 
too; even though -- as we realize -- it means she has died. Death and life go 
hand in hand.

<P>
If you were lucky enough to be introduced to Homer in your youth without any of 
the trappings of scholarship or the tempting snares of translation theory, you 
know that the whole point about Homer is that he is a terrific storyteller who 
has a couple of terrific stories to tell. Once you've read them -- or, better 
yet, had them read to you -- you have, whether you realize it or not, a 
standard against which to measure what you will probably be taught later to 
call "narrative" and "character" and "descriptive action." And if you are so 
rash as to attempt writing your own stories, you will almost certainly find 
yourself from time to time suffering a degree of depression. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, you can console yourself by reflecting that you are not, after all, 
able to take advantage of the far-seeing aid of some powerful divine figures 
who prove to be as devious and self-serving a bunch as any latter-day crew of 
con artists. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what your age is on first reading, the chances are you will not be 
too greatly concerned over whether one voice or many lie behind the stories, 
but you will probably feel something of the differences between the swinging 
action of the siege of Troy, with all its direct confrontations and bloody 
encounters, and the wily quality of Odysseus as he takes the longest possible 
way home. 
</P>
<P>
It was this seeming contradiction that led Samuel ("Way of All Flesh") Butler 
to put forward his characteristically cranky theory that whereas "The Iliad" 
was clearly an active, masculine tale, "The Odyssey," on the other hand, could 
have been written only by a clever, brilliant woman, laughing at all the brawny 
stupid males boasting of their powerful biceps. For Odysseus -- "the man of 
many wiles," as Mandelbaum chooses to translate his formulaic description -- 
relies more on his brains than his brawn, and though he does his best to look 
after his impetuous men, he alone wins home in the end. 
</P>
<P>
With so many translations in both prose and verse available by now, the chief 
interests, particularly in verse translations, are the choices the translator 
has made in undertaking what is, after all, a tremendous, daunting task. So far 
as the enormous accretion of scholarship is concerned, with the endless debates 
concerning the unity of voice, the influence of the oral tradition, the 
patterning of fairly constricting formulas, Bernard Knox's introduction to "The 
Iliad" summarizes both the history and the shifts in scholarly assumptions with 
an even hand. He concludes with a persuasive presentation of Achilles as "the 
model for the tragic hero of the Sophoclean stage." 
</P>
<P>
For his handling of Homer's metrics, Fagles has worked with "a loose five- or 
six-beat line but inclining more to six" that he expands "at times to seven 
beats -- to imply the big reach of a simile or some vehement outburst in 
discourse or the pitched fury of combat on the field." Sometimes he contracts 
this "to three, to give a point in speech or action sharper stress." The result 
is a heightened conversational tone than can rise to the rhetoric of: 
</P>
<P>
 Three times the brilliant runner 
</P>
<P>
Achilles charged him, 
</P>
<P>
 lunged with his bronze spear, 
</P>
<P>
three times he slashed at cloud -- 
</P>
<P>
 then at Achilles' fourth assault like 
</P>
<P>
something superhuman 
</P>
<P>
 his terrifying voice burst out in 
</P>
<P>
winging words: 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, again, you've escaped your 
</P>
<P>
death, you dog, 
</P>
<P>
 but a good close brush with death 
</P>
<P>
it was, I'd say!" 
</P>
<P>
 . . . through the conversational level of Helen's speech: 
</P>
<P>
Homer, Sweet Homer 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Laertes' son, the great 
</P>
<P>
tactician Odysseus. 
</P>
<P>
 He was bred in the land of Ithaca. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky ground 
</P>
<P>
 and he's quick at every treachery 
</P>
<P>
under the sun -- 
</P>
<P>
 the man of twists and turns." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
. . . to the entertainingly prosy: 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing his anger flare, field 
</P>
<P>
marshal Agamemnon 
</P>
<P>
 smiled broadly and took back his 
</P>
<P>
taunts at once . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Mandelbaum takes up the traditional problems of Homeric scholarship in an 
afterword, acknowledging his debt to the landmark six-volume edition of "The 
Odyssey" published by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, remarking wryly: "Translation 
exacts and invites much micro-labor, many days in the burrows. (Though the 
frequency of controversy in questions Homeric often makes the burrows seem like 
trenches.)" The conflict between the Dismemberers and the Unitarians continues, 
and Mandelbaum is entertaining on "the wens, warts, and blebs on the body of 
scholarly controversy." 
</P>
<P>
For this translation itself, Mandelbaum has chosen to work within a quite 
different pattern from Fagles', using what appears to be a more traditionally 
English line, a freely handled iambic pentameter, but one that is underpinned 
by the basic four-stress rhythm, frequently accompanied by the alliterative 
echoes, of Anglo-Saxon verse. It is reminiscent of Pound's "making new" of a 
part of Book XI of "The Odyssey" in "Canto I." 
</P>
<P>
Mandelbaum stakes out his ground in the opening passages of Book I with an 
occasional line that actually goes beyond the original model. We have, for 
example: 
</P>
<P>
 -- he still could not depend 
</P>
<P>
 upon fair fortune or unfailing 
</P>
<P>
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Mandelbaum lets us know that even though he will make no 
effort to improve upon such set phrases as "the winedark sea," he is willing to 
risk using a word like "brouhaha" twice within a few pages: 
</P>
<P>
 . . . lest his guest, 
</P>
<P>
 in all that brouhaha, might look 
</P>
<P>
askance 
</P>
<P>
 at feasting with such overbearing 
</P>
<P>
men -- 
</P>
<P>
And: 
</P>
<P>
 Feast with pleasure 
</P>
<P>
 for now, but let there be no 
</P>
<P>
brouhaha. 
</P>
<P>
 The variety that is available in this pattern can be illustrated by leaping 
forward to the end of Book XX, when one of Penelope's suitors scornfully speaks 
to her son: 
</P>
<P>
 "No man is more unfortunate 
</P>
<P>
than you, 
</P>
<P>
 Telemachus, in picking guests. 
</P>
<P>
Witness: 
</P>
<P>
 You found this filthy vagabond, 
</P>
<P>
a man 
</P>
<P>
 who scrounges bread and wine, 
</P>
<P>
who is unfit 
</P>
<P>
 for work or war, a deadweight 
</P>
<P>
on this earth; 
</P>
<P>
 and then that other fellow, who 
</P>
<P>
got up 
</P>
<P>
 to prophesy . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Both of these translations pass the ultimate test of being read aloud, though 
each produces its own distinct impression. Anyone caring to add an additional 
dimension should try sounding out the original -- the Greek alphabet is, after 
all, easily learned, as witness the elementary requirement of fraternal and 
sororal membership -- with the literal prose translation of what Uncle Ez 
called the Low Ebb Classics in hand.

A TWO-BENNY OPERA; 
</P>
<P>
SUNDAY NIGHTS AT SEVEN; 
</P>
<P>
THE JACK BENNY STORY BY JACK BENNY AND HIS DAUGHTER JOAN (WARNER BOOKS: $19.95; 
302 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gary Giddins, Giddins' most recent book is Satchmo (Doubleday). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Benny explains why Rochester was a good name for a butler: It sounds "kind 
of English and it was incongruous for me to have an English butler. Also the 
word has a good hard texture. It's a name you can bite into. If I was mad at 
him, I could yell, 'RAH-chester.' It was an ideal name when I lost my temper." 
</P>
<P>
Now at this moment, if you are a Jack Benny fan, you cannot keep yourself from 
looking away from the page, mentally hearing him bleat "RAH-chester," and 
smiling. If Benny is unknown to you, you have no idea what I'm talking about. 
</P>
<P>
In recounting routines, characters and memorably big yucks (he's got them timed 
to the second), Benny tries hard, often with provocative insight, to understand 
and convey what made his 23-year radio show and partially overlapping 15-year 
television show unique institutions in the cultural life of this century. Yet 
even he is at a loss to explain how he refined his gentle spell. 
</P>
<P>
On ethnic humor: "Bad as you may think this kind of humor was, I think it was a 
way that America heated up the national groups and the ethnic groups in a 
melting pot and made one people of us -- or tried to do so. . . . I do not feel 
today that Rochester and Mr. Kitzel were socially harmful. You don't hate a 
race when you're laughing with it. You couldn't hate Rochester. You loved 
Kitzel. You loved Rochester." 
</P>
<P>
On his character's sex life: "There's a kind of bittersweet side to the sex 
game and if you can play it somewhere between broad farce on the one hand and 
tragedy on the other, you get a fine irony which reflects a true-to-life 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Benny was probably the most beloved entertainer of his time, by audiences and 
associates alike. He was surely the most reassuring. From the Depression 
through the '60s, he was a model of stability -- -forever 39 years old, vain, 
stingy, absurd. "Everything good that happened to me happened by accident," he 
says, and you tend to believe he believed that. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in fact, he was a great innovator: the man who figured out that radio, and 
later television, played to small clumps of people in intimate settings, and 
that character itself was the best source of humor. How real his cast of 
characters were to his audience may be difficult if not impossible for modern 
viewers to gauge. Several regulars on his show legally changed their names to 
those of the characters they played, including his wife, formerly Sadye Marks 
Benny, thereafter Mary Livingstone Benny. Imagine the Cosby cast changing its 
names to Huxtable. 
</P>
<P>
Although Benny was astonished to discover that millions of people mistook Jack 
Benny for "Jack Benny," he was bemused by how often he found himself acting 
like his fictional alter ego. Just as his program made him the butt of all the 
jokes (another Benny innovation), his memoir finds him recounting incidents in 
which he ends up playing the fool. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the character, however, he appears to have been free of excessive or 
even normal vanity -- though he was so involved with the details of his show 
that he could fail to recognize members of his family. True, he proclaims: "I 
am a master of my kind of timing." But who would disagree? Benny got his 
biggest laughs cradling his chagrined face in the palm of one hand and staring 
into the middle distance. In his later years, he took his violin playing 
seriously as well, always insisting that the numerous benefit concerts he 
played were for real and not put-ons. Still, Benny remained the ideal audience 
-- delighted when someone else got the biggest laughs. 
</P>
<P>
One of his best anecdotes tells how he browbeat Jack Warner into hiring the 
eccentric character actor Percy Kilbride for the movie adaptation of "George 
Washington Slept Here." Benny had seen Kilbride -- then unknown in Hollywood, 
later famous as Pa Kettle -- in the New York stage version and found him 
utterly hilarious. Warner couldn't understand why Benny, the star of the 
picture, would wage a fight to bring in an unknown who would undoubtedly steal 
it from him. The mogul finally agreed to give Kilbride a screen test when Benny 
offered to pay for it. It was a disaster: Benny couldn't stop laughing. Even 
after Kilbride was hired, Benny kept cracking up on the set. Warner threatened 
to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
Benny enthusiasts will be pleased to have his recollections, which -- in the 
absence of a first-rate biography -- can be added to an uneven shelf of memoirs 
by his manager, his wife and one of his writers. Yet "Sunday Nights at Seven" 
is a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
In her introduction, Joan Benny refers to a manuscript, discovered a decade 
after her father's death: "almost four hundred pages -- a completed book." 
Where is it? There is nothing like that kind of bulk here, and no indication 
that the book Benny started writing in 1972 was completed. He has little to say 
about Dennis Day, Don Wilson, Frank Nelson and other regulars on the show, and 
doesn't even mention Harry Conn, the writer who helped conceive the Benny 
program and with whom he later feuded. 
</P>
<P>
He's good on his many years in vaudeville (Benny was already 40 the first time 
he appeared on radio), but extremely circumspect about his fellow performers, 
including the already legendary Nora Bayes, with whom he is said to have had an 
affair. He tells a story about Larry Adler and President Eisenhower, but says 
nothing of Adler's problem with the blacklist. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, Benny's narrative is repeatedly interrupted with long stretches by his 
daughter, who, though she acknowledges early on the childhood lesson of 
learning it was her father and not she who was the family celebrity, writes at 
length about herself. Her self-portrait is of a petulant and spoiled child 
("Okay, I was spoiled! But very, very lucky!") who later breezed in and out of 
a series of marriages and now revels in the memory of growing up rich and 
coddled. 
</P>
<P>
She can describe an old gown in detail and recite the guest lists of her 
parents' lavish parties (as a child, Joan was allowed to choose three guests 
who would be brought to her for a private audience), but she is a pedestrian 
writer, cursed with the amateur's penchant for exclamations ("Wow! I was in the 
same room with Cary Grant!") and the irritating habit of referring to her 
father exclusively as "Daddy." 
</P>
<P>
She is more persuasive when she speaks of "Mother," by all accounts a cool, 
imperious woman with expensive tastes who became something of a recluse in her 
later years. The animosity between mother and daughter triggers more emotion 
than the almost unsullied adoration of Daddy. 
</P>
<P>
The question remains, what happened to those 400 pages? Benny and his daughter 
refer to the existence of letters and scripts as well. One can't help but think 
that a more rewarding book might have been sewn from those diverse materials. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Joan Benny has unburdened herself on her love of classical music, her 
contribution to the war effort ("gardening, collecting eggs, knitting"), her 
crush on Van Johnson and her "magnificent" first wedding, perhaps that material 
will be unveiled in its entirety, at the very least for the benefit of a 
suitable biographer.

<P>
Woman on the Beach (AMC Sunday at 10 a.m.) Jean Renoir's last Hollywood movie 
is a moody thriller, about a deadly erotic triangle centering on a blind 
ex-painter. Though ruinously cut by RKO, it's regarded by critic-filmmaker 
Jacques Rivette as one of Renoir's great works. 
</P>
<P>
Moonfleet (TNT Tuesday at 10:15 p.m.) Another Hollywood obscurity revered in 
France is this somberly picturesque 18th-Century costumer, in a moonlit-seas 
Robert Louis Stevenson mood, by director Fritz Lang. John Houseman produced; 
Stewart Granger and George Sanders star. 
</P>
<P>
Confidence (Bravo Thursday at 6 p.m. &amp; 10:30 p.m.) An unusual World War II 
romance by the masterful Hungarian director, Istvan ("Mephisto") Szabo; in it, 
a couple, thrown together to fool the Nazis, find themselves in the grip of 
both terror and love. 
</P>
<P>
The Naked Spur (TMC Friday at 2 p.m.) Perhaps the best of the top-notch Anthony 
Mann-Jimmy Stewart Western cycle: a picaresque thriller in which wily killer 
Robert Ryan amiably spreads dissension among the trio bringing him in for 
bounty. 
</P>
<P>
Movie Movie (ABC Sunday Dec. 16 at 2 a.m.). Two delicious '30's movie parodies, 
one on Busby-Berkeley style musicals, the other on "Golden Boy"-style fight 
pictures, by director Stanley Donen and writer Larry Gelbart.

I would like to thank TBS for their "Good News" program (Sundays at 7:05 a.m.). 
It is like a breath of fresh air to see some positive information on the news 
and to find out about people who are doing good things with their lives and 
sharing with others. It's a very upbeat program.

MOVIES OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Swing Shift (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) shows that unpredictable and 
refreshing filmmaker, Jonathan Demme, seemingly hamstrung by his star, Goldie 
Hawn, in a World War II era feminist home-front comedy-drama that should have 
been much better. Christine Lahti, as usual, steals every scene in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Every Which Way But Loose (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.), the biggest box-office 
hit of star Clint Eastwood's career, also inspired Norman Mailer's memorable 
essay on Eastwood's cinematic cool. It's the one with Eastwood as bare-knuckle 
boxer Philo Beddoe, who's better at charming orangutans (named Clyde) than 
women, and it's low-pressure, easy-riding entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Some Like It Hot (Channel 11 Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.) is, natch, Billy Wilder's 
all-time champ of a comedy, with Prohibition gangsters, desperate musicians in 
drag, and Marilyn Monroe as "Sugar Kane" -- whom an admiring Jack Lemmon 
describes as "Jell-O on springs." 
</P>
<P>
Buffs eager for glimpses of the young Kim Basinger might want to examine the 
1981 Katie: Portrait of a Centerfold (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.), in which 
director Robert Greenwald and a slightly camp cast (Dorothy Malone, Fabian, Tab 
Hunter and Don Johnson) try to give us the inside dirt on nude modeling. Others 
beware. 
</P>
<P>
Big Shots (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 p.m.) is a mind-boggling 
ludicrous 1987 stab at mixing children and crime: a kind of John Hughes road 
movie, with two underage boys, one black, one white, improbably driving 
cross-country, in the midst of the usual murder and carnage. Robert Mandel 
directs -- we hope with a twinge of shame. 
</P>
<P>
For those who believe TV advertising is taking over the movies, writer-director 
Michael Crichton's vapid sci-fi sex thriller Looker (Channel 13 Saturday at 6 
p.m.) offers disturbing proof. It seems to be about a sinister conspiracy to 
make holograms of beautiful women and kill people, but it's shot as if it were 
a long advertisement for some product that's never revealed. A bevy of beauties 
and stars -- including Albert Finney, James Coburn, Susan Dey and even Vanna 
White -- all peddle their wares, coldly. 
</P>
<P>
In Penitentiary III (Channel 13 Saturday at 8 p.m.) Jamaa Fanaka's sequel to 
his earlier jail thrillers, Leon Isaac Kennedy, the pawn of rival police and 
Mafia boxing teams, proves that three-time losers get the worst of it. 
</P>
<P>
That venerable and much-loved husband-wife acting team, Hume Cronyn and Jessica 
Tandy, take center stage in Hallmark Hall of Fame's Foxfire (CBS Saturday at 9 
p.m.), director Jud Taylor's film adaptation of the spare but heartwarming 
play, written by Cronyn and Susan Cooper, about an elderly Appalachian couple, 
humanity's seasons and loves that survive death. Tandy won both the Tony and 
Emmy for this part.

AMERICAN DATELINES by Ed Cray, Jonathan Kotler and Miles Beller (Facts on File: 
$24.95; 382 pp.). Nothing is as fragile as a newspaper byline; in a single 
generation, it's been said, the great names of the city room are one with 
Nineveh and Tyre. Hoping to stem that sad tide, a trio from USC's School of 
Journalism has rescued 140 actual news stories from dusty morgues and yellowing 
clip files. Now you can read the police story filed by the Washington Post's Al 
Lewis that first reported the Watergate break-in; cringe at "A Dastard's Deed," 
a rather partisan reporting of the shooting of Jesse James, and stand in awe 
with a New York Times reporter on top of the newly opened Empire State 
Building. A nifty idea, imaginatively executed, and complete with the original, 
often hyperventilating headlines.

THE QUOTE SLEUTH: A Manual for the Tracer of Lost Quotations by Anthony W. 
Shipps (University of Illinois Press: $24.95; 194 pp.). According to Shipps, 
who takes as his motto Dr. Watson's observation that "like all Holmes's 
reasoning the thing seemed simplicity itself when it was once explained," no 
quote is ever truly lost, only temporarily misplaced. Shipps not only shares 
his familiarity with such arcane volumes of quotes as "The Wit and Wisdom of 
George Eliot" and the potentially oxymoronic "Quote It! Memorable Legal 
Quotations," he is also full of such hard-earned bits of information as "when 
you see the heroic couplet, you should think first of Pope." This is not only 
the most intriguing reference book of the year, it is also larded with more 
than its share of memorable quotes, such as Mark Twain's observation that "In 
the first place, God made idiots. This was for practice. Then He made School 
Boards."

THE FEMINIST COMPANION TO LITERATURE IN ENGLISH,edited by Virginia Blain, 
Isobel Grundy and Patricia Clements (Yale University Press: $49.95; 1,231 pp.). 
This authoritative tome did not easily see the light of day: That trio of 
editors and 75 other contributors labored for eight years to compile more than 
2,700 thoughtful, spirited entries ranging from stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, author 
of "The G-String Murders" ("praised by Janet Flanner for its 'decollete' style 
and 'mascara language' "), to medieval visionary and recluse Julian of Norwich, 
"currently claimed as patron by widely varying political and religious groups." 
A most impressive work that can be used both literally and figuratively as a 
club to subdue stubborn sexists.

TRAVELS IN ARABIA AND AFRICA: Four Lectures by Sir Richard Burton, edited by 
John Hayman (The Huntington Library: $24.95; 120 pp.). and CATALOGUE OF THE 
LIBRARY OF SIR RICHARD BURTON, K.C.M.G. by B. J. Kirkpatrick (The Huntington 
Library: $19.95; 182 pp.). Of all the facts in the life of this famous 
traveler, translator and intrepid collector of expressive erotica, perhaps none 
is odder than that his library has come to rest in the sunny confines of San 
Marino's Huntington Library. This handy guide to what he read lists everything 
from "Notes on Scalping" to the sonnets of Milton. Burton's lectures, 
apparently delivered while the great man spent a genteel exile as British 
consul to Brazil, give the full flavor of both his fierce temperament and his 
fiercer curiosity.

THE MOVIE LIST BOOK: A Reference Guide to Film Themes, Settings, and Series by 
Richard B. Armstrong and Mary Willems Armstrong (McFarland &amp; Co., Box 611, 
Jefferson, NC 28640: $31.95 postpaid; 377 pp.). The idea of cataloguing films 
by subject is not really a new one, but no previous volume has attacked the 
task with such zeal and such an oddball sensibility. What is one to say, after 
all, about a book that lets you know in no uncertain terms that "the movie 
dentist has experienced a checkered career since his extravagant debut in Erich 
von Stroheim's nine-hour marathon silent movie, 'Greed.' " Other sections 
include movies about insects, tattoos, the Bermuda Triangle and Bigfoot. And 
for those looking for something more elevated, there is a list of both Eric 
Rohmer's Six Moral Tales and his Comedies and Proverbs. 
</P>
<P>

SEEDS IN THE WIND: Early Signs of Genius, edited by Neville Braybrooke (Mercury 
House: $17.95; 208 pp.). If you think it's easy to discern future greatness in 
the musings of childhood, this determined little book will change your mind. 
Who could foresee "Animal Farm" or "1984" in the 11-year-old George Orwell, who 
began a poem with the stanza "Oh! give me the strength of the Lion / The wisdom 
of Reynard the Fox / And then I'll hurl troops at the Germans / And give them 
the hardest of knocks." Many future literary giants chose the oddest of topics 
for their first efforts: W. H. Auden wrote a deeply felt ode to "The Traction 
Engine," T. E. Lawrence held forth on "Playground Football" and Stevie Smith 
wrote a jaunty poem called "Spanky-Wanky." Also included is a grumpy letter to 
the editor from James Thurber, who declared: "Nobody wants his earliest and 
worst writing to be perpetuated. Such a collection would be nothing but a big 
bore." You have been warned.

WALKS IN HEMINGWAY'S PARISby Noel Riley Fitch (St. Martin's Press: $16.95; 195 
pp.). It is impossible to walk through certain sections of Paris without 
thinking of the literary masters who walked there before you, and equally 
impossible to figure out exactly where they walked. A certain cafe may look as 
though it were created expressly for short-story writing, a downtrodden hotel 
can seem the perfect place for a penniless scribe to hole up in, but who's to 
know for sure? Now, thanks to Ms. Fitch, one can say with assurance that Le Pre 
aux Clercs at 30 rue Bonaparte was Ernest Hemingway's first neighborhood 
restaurant, and that the fourth-floor walk-up at 74 rue du Cardinal-Lemoine was 
his first apartment. And because Hemingway was such a gregarious sort, we also 
learn the haunts of cohorts ranging from John Dos Passos to James Joyce.

STATESMAN'S YEAR-BOOK,edited by John Paxton (St. Martin's Press: $65; 1,690 
pp.). c,8.5,pl For 127 years, the folks over at England's The Statesman have 
been putting out this positively encyclopedic compendium of facts and 
statistics about the countries that uneasily coexist in our world. This may 
sound terribly dry, but there is something compelling about a book that tells 
you there are 657 cinemas in Columbia (64 of them in Bogota), that the air 
force of Rwanda includes 10 helicopters and that July and August are virtually 
rainless everywhere in Portugal. Countries like the United States, the 
U.S.S.R., and India, which are made up of sizeable states, are given a separate 
section for each state, and the yearbook also boasts tables showing worldwide 
cultivation of wheat, maize, barley, oats and the like. As comprehensive a book 
as the law allows. 
</P>

THE CONDOM INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATESby James S. Murphy (McFarland &amp; 
Co., Box 611, Jefferson, NC 28640: $31.95 postpaid, 176 pp.). Written by an 
economist and former vice president of a major condom manufacturer, this 
earnest study, complete with tables like "Nominal Natural Latex Prices" and 
"Ten-Year Drugstore Sales Trends," is an unexpectedly engrossing look at an 
industry that the specter of AIDS has drawn back into the limelight. Though the 
historical introduction that traces the condom back to Egypt, circa 1350 BC, 
may appear to be the most involving to non-economists, the section about the 
manufacturing and testing process ("Condoms usually stretch beyond the required 
1.5 cubic feet, about the size of a watermelon, before bursting") is equally 
alluring. The description of The Kinked Demand Curve, however, is not nearly as 
racy as it sounds.

<P>
NAME THE SEVEN DWARFS: And Other Numbered Diversions by Diane Giddis (William 
Morrow: $15.95; 168 pp.). The idea for this book apparently came to its author 
on a convivial night in a bar, but its fascination is hardly limited to 
imbibers. Who among us would not like to have, conveniently located in one slim 
volume, a list of the five Iroquois nations, the six crises faced by Richard 
Nixon, the 12 actors who played "The Dirty Dozen," or, if you're of a more 
spiritual bent, Maimonides' 13 principles of faith and the 14 stations of the 
cross? This volume certainly fills a need, though one feels hard-pressed to say 
exactly what that need is. Kenneth Turan

<TEXT>
<P>
Can someone please explain why, when Ann Richards divorced, it was considered a 
"failed marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Yet when writing about Williams, I quote, "Along the way, he married, fathered 
two daughters, then divorced in 1964." The writer, making it sound as if 
Williams' divorce was just a stroll through the park, feeds into the so-called 
macho image. It appears to me that J. Michael Kennedy has a little of the same 
prejudice that has made Clayton Williams so popular in Texas.

<P>
I disagree with what Harry Shearer was trying to get across to readers when he 
wrote "Tube-tied" (Oct. 28). 
</P>
<P>
The problem is regulating what children watch; if we don't, who will? Shows for 
children, especially those shown at school, should be screened. Millions of 
taxpayers are not willing to give up money to have their kids going to school 
to watch television. 
</P>
<P>
Christoper Whittle and company may be paying for the VCRs and televisions, but 
who is paying for the teachers' to "teach" the children? If we do not allow 
these subliminal commercials to enter the public school, then we will not have 
to worry about it being regurgitated in our children.

Q &amp; A / PIERRE SAUVAGE: DOCUMENTING HEROES OF THE HOLOCAUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan King 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Film-maker Pierre Sauvage, who is Jewish, was born 47 years ago in 
Nazi-occupied France in Le Chambon, a tiny farming village in the mountains 
about 350 miles southeast of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, thousands of Jews were being turned over by the French to the 
Germans for deportation. But the small Protestant peasant community became a 
refuge for more than 5,000 Jews, many of them children. No one in the village 
ever betrayed the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, Sauvage returned to Le Chambon to make "Weapons of the 
Spirit," the acclaimed feature documentary about the townspeople who saved 
thousands of lives, including his own. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, PBS premieres "Weapons of the Spirit," preceded by an 
introduction by journalist Bill Moyers and a Moyers interview with Sauvage. 
</P>
<P>
Sauvage discussed his odyssey of making "Weapons of the Spirit" with Susan 
King. 
</P>
<P>
Did the world know of Le Chambon until your film? 
</P>
<P>
There was a book written about 10 years ago, but by and large, until the film, 
the story remained very obscure. 
</P>
<P>
Was this film something you had planned for several years? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I decided to do it pretty quickly and was able to start shooting 
pretty quickly. But unfortunately, I only had the resources to shoot, not to 
edit or put it together, so that was a problem throughout the rest of the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
But in addition, it was simply a difficult subject for me to understand. I 
really hadn't been, in a sense, prepared to deal with such a subject. I come 
from a very anti-religious background, and here I was planning to make a film 
in praise of committed Christians. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-religious? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I was brought up in an extremely un-Jewish home, insofar as my parents 
kept the fact they were Jewish a secret. In fact they kept it from me. I only 
learned I was Jewish when I was 18. The film was an attempt to connect with an 
identity and with roots which had been severed. 
</P>
<P>
It must have been an amazing experience then to go back to the town where you 
were born. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, every trip back there has been an amazing experience. That trip to 
make the film was an extraordinary experience. For anybody to be able to 
reconstruct the circumstances of his or her birth is lucky under any 
circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
In my case, it was a historical event of some importance, but there was also 
the mere challenge of making the film and concern if these people would 
cooperate. It was so much against their nature to talk about what they did, to 
attach importance to it, and here I was asking them to not just to talk about 
it, but to lend me their own photographs and allow me to make them characters 
in a film. That was certainly of great concern to them. 
</P>
<P>
Did it take you a long time to win their confidence? 
</P>
<P>
I can't say it actually took a long time, but I started with people that I knew 
already. I started with people who had helped my parents. They weren't going to 
turn me down. I think when people found out that I had been born there, there 
was a sense of trust that developed very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the documentary, one is struck by the fact the townspeople seem so 
matter-of-fact about what they did. 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly right. That was the single most surprising thing I learned about 
them in the course of trying to understand all of this better. People who do 
such things with their lives under any circumstance are far from being people 
who agonize over the decision and make a big deal about it. 
</P>
<P>
They are people who do it because it appears to them to be the only thing to do 
and hence, when they express surprise when people consider it a big deal, this 
isn't modesty. They are doing what comes naturally to them. And they can't 
understand how anybody could consider that they would have done anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Have many of the Jews who were hidden by the townspeople returned? 
</P>
<P>
There are a number who have returned periodically. There was a reunion, in 
fact, which took place in October which was a big event. It was also the 
occasion of the local premiere of my film. It was the first time the villagers 
were seeing the film. 
</P>
<P>
What was their reaction? 
</P>
<P>
It was a very exciting experience. The most important thing to me was that they 
liked the film. I don't think there was any other approval that mattered more 
to me than theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The film, while attempting to preserve their simplicity, underscores how 
special they were for us. And I knew that would make some of them 
uncomfortable, but I think they measured that I had tried not to make cardboard 
heroes out of them and not to sentimentalize them. They were very responsive. 
That was very moving to me. 
</P>
<P>
Is the film currently in theaters in France? 
</P>
<P>
At the same time we had the premiere in Le Chambon, it was opening in Paris. It 
is doing well. I think that the response by people in the audience has been 
extremely good. The response by the press has been very good, but hesitant. 
These are still subjects that the French are not thrilled to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
The reviews have all been favorable, but some of them have been small. It's not 
being trumpeted as a big event, but maybe that's the way a film like this has 
to make its way in France -- settling in a movie theater for a long run. 
</P>
<P>
"Weapons of the Spirit" airs Wednesday at 8 p.m. on Channel 50; 9 p.m. on 
Channel 28; 9:35 p.m. on Channel 15 and 10 p.m. on Channel 24.

OUTTAKES: ANATOMY OF A SURPRISE BLOCKBUSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was supposed to be the Christmas season when adult films took center 
stage. But along came Kevin, an 8-year-old who screams "Holy cow!" and karate 
chops his way across movie screens shouting "Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly everything changed. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin is the kid in 20th Century Fox's raging hit, "Home Alone," which has 
taken the movie industry by surprise and upstaged some of the season's biggest 
pictures, starting with "Rocky V." Many in the industry are predicting that 
"Home Alone" will go right on shaking things up as the more adult-oriented 
pictures are released in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Home Alone," in which young Kevin (10-year-old Macaulay Culkin) terrorizes a 
pair of bumbling burglars who show up after his vacationing parents have 
inadvertently left him behind, sold an astounding $68.2 million worth of 
tickets in its first 19 days of release. Business has been brisk even on 
weeknights. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the studio increased the number of screens by 82; this weekend 
400 more were added. The total is now more than 1,700 nationally (by contrast, 
"Rocky V" opened on about 2,053 screens). The way he's going, Kevin may have 
enough clout left by Christmas to keep "The Godfather, Part III" from muscling 
in at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a David in a 'David and Goliath' story," says Fox marketing chief Tom 
Sherak. "Right from the very beginning, this has been perceived as nothing but 
a little movie. A lot of newspapers didn't even want to write about it. They 
told us, 'Come back to us after the movie opens.' 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can predict movies that turn out as well as 'Home Alone.' You can 
believe in the movie and feel you have a good movie. But these kinds of 
pictures come along rarely. We're flying at 38,000 feet and we don't want to 
come in for a landing." 
</P>
<P>
The success of the film, directed by Chris Columbus for writer-producer John 
Hughes, can't be attributed merely to striking a chord with the public. A savvy 
marketing campaign positioned the movie in the right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
Fox only had the chance to get its hands on the property because Warner Bros. 
pulled the plug on the project last February just before it went into 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, speaking from the Chicago set of his currently shooting "Curley Sue," 
which Warners will distribute, says the $16 million-$17 million budget for 
"Home Alone" was too high for Warners' tastes. 
</P>
<P>
So Hughes took the movie to Fox, where the former president of his Hughes 
Entertainment Co., Tom Jacobson, was working as executive vice president of 
production. Fox studio chairman Joe Roth and production president Roger 
Birnbaum quickly green-lighted the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Sherak recalls that "Hughes and Columbus first showed us the movie in September 
with an audience. We came out of that theater and said to ourselves, 'Holy cow! 
This could be a big movie.' 
</P>
<P>
"Once we found that out, and because of the theme, we figured it would be a 
Christmas movie. But we knew that we didn't have stars, and if it didn't 
perform at Thanksgiving, it would be out of the theaters before Christmas, to 
make room for the slew of holiday pictures." 
</P>
<P>
Sherak says Fox originally settled on a Nov. 21 opening because it would be the 
opening for MGM/UA's "Rocky V" and "Valkenvania," a Chevy Chase starrer from 
Warners. "We believed there would be enough room in the marketplace (between 
those two movies) for us to get a shot." 
</P>
<P>
"Rocky V," however, was moved up to Nov. 16 and "Valkenvania" was held until 
next year. Nov. 21 was suddenly clear. 
</P>
<P>
Then, according to Sherak, executives at Disney decided to move their Christmas 
release, "Three Men and a Little Lady," from its scheduled opening date of Dec. 
21 to Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision sent Fox's executives back into the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
"We said to ourselves that to open it on the same day as this monster movie, 
which was a sequel and which appealed to largely the same audience as our 
movie, was a mistake. So we decided that even though it was five days too early 
(for what is generally considered to be the start of the Christmas movie 
season), we'd open on Nov. 16, against 'Rocky.' We wanted to give 'Home Alone' 
a running start against 'Three Men.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even with a jump, however, the starless "Home Alone" needed word of mouth. 
Hughes rushed editing in time for Fox to sneak the picture in 1,000 theaters on 
the Saturday before the opening day, advertised with TV buys. 
</P>
<P>
"The word of mouth started and the picture opened a week later," Sherak says. 
"It became a hot movie and people were talking about it. Five percent of the 
first week's audience were repeats from the sneaks audiences (from the week 
before)." 
</P>
<P>
Sherak predicts that "Home Alone" will "hold through Christmas" at or near the 
top of the box-office charts. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes figures that the movie is popular because "it's warm and funny. Warm and 
funny is sort of becoming scarce in the real world. Violence is taking over." 
</P>
<P>
He thinks there may be a sequel, perhaps "Alone, Again." 
</P>
<P>
"I have more things I could do with Kevin's character," he says. "There's room 
to expand the character. There's room for another chapter. I think everyone 
wants to make it."

Variety, the show-biz weekly, was "kidding a bit" with last week's splashy, 
Page 1 headline -- written in Japanese characters. So says editor Peter Bart, 
who translates the headline: "Buyer Beware" -- a reference to the recent 
purchase of MCA Inc. by the Osaka-based electronics firm Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
Bart and executive editor Caroline Miller got the idea when they heard a 
reporter say she had dreamed that Variety, itself a subsidiary of a British 
firm, was published all in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
With Matsushita's planned $6.1-billion acquisition of MCA and Sony Corp.'s 
purchase of Columbia and Tri-Star Pictures last year, Japanese interests have a 
stronghold in the U.S. movie business. 
</P>
<P>
Bart says there was no intention of offending the Japanese buyers, just an 
effort to follow in the tradition of the paper's much-fabled quirky headlines. 
He decided not to print a translation, but to let the headline "be something 
folks can discuss at their local sushi parlors." 
</P>
<P>
Bart's interpretation of the headline, which accompanied his own article: 
"Matsushita perhaps didn't consider all of the ramifications of the purchase. 
There are political and cultural problems they face." David J. Fox

OUTTAKES: 'MISERY' MIX-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pat H. Broeske 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not uncommon for filmmakers to lodge protests with critics who take shots 
at their films. But in the case of Vincent Canby's critique of "Misery," an 
irate Rob Reiner called the New York Times before the review was even in print. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, who had obtained an advance computer printout copy of Canby's negative 
review (through undisclosed means), was angered by the critic's descriptions of 
scenes that, while vivid enough in the Stephen King novel upon which the movie 
was based, were not included in the movie at all. Reiner alerted New York Times 
culture editor Paul Goldberger to the confusion the night before the review was 
to run. 
</P>
<P>
According to Goldberger, Canby "willingly and eagerly" corrected his mistakes. 
Then, due to a "production error," the incorrect version was printed in the 
225,000-copy national edition on Friday, Nov. 30. The next day, the revised 
version appeared in the national edition, along with a correction announcement, 
giving "Misery" the distinction of being reviewed twice in two days in the same 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, while decrying the "sadism" of the movie, the most violent scenes 
Canby cites in his early review are found only in the book. And in both 
versions, he describes an event in the book that was actually only in the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
At the "Misery" West Coast premiere the night before the review ran, Reiner 
expressed anger about the mix-up, but last week he declined to discuss it. A 
spokesman for Reiner's Castle Rock Ent. said that Reiner was satisfied with the 
paper's understanding and quick response. 
</P>
<P>
As for having essentially the same negative review of the movie published in 
back-to-back editions of the New York Times, the spokesman said, "Well, it's a 
little bit better than a sharp stick in the eye. But just a little." Pat H.

MIXED MEDIA: ** "STRANGE TOO" DEPECHE MODE WARNER REPRISE VIDEO ($16.95)

Sure, the Mode is the champion of the adolescent alienation and isolation set, 
and these six clips of songs from the current "Violator" album are Mode at its 
most alienated and isolated. 
</P>
<P>
But the triumph of the band's success and of its mass concert rituals is in 
demonstrating the universality of these feelings. For the most part, these 
videos -- shot in grainy Super 8 by photographer-filmmaker Anton Corbijn -- 
fail to illuminate or expand on that. Only singer David Gahan's bored and 
lonely king of all he surveys in "Enjoy the Silence" and singer Martin Gore's 
curiously fatalistic make-out scene with a gorgeous woman in "Clean" 
effectively illustrate the songs. The others offer little more than bored 
fatalism. STEVE HOCHMAN

MIXED MEDIA: ** "FLEETWOOD: MY LIFE AND ADVENTURES IN FLEETWOOD MAC" BY MICK

OK all you MacRumour Mongers, here's the whole story: the sex, the drugs, the 
partner-swapping, the comings-and-goings, the schizophrenia, the bankruptcies 
and, oh yes, the great music that is, was and apparently forever shall be the 
big Mac. 
</P>
<P>
Fleetwood tells the story as if he was sitting in your living room, which is 
good for the intimacy of the tale, but bad for the rambling, sometimes 
redundant telling. Like the band itself, the story goes on and on, though 
insights and intrigue come frequently enough to keep it moving. And it fleshes 
out what MacFans already know: Mick is one of rock's more colorful characters.

RECORD RACK: ROBERT PALMER GOES ELECTRIC -- R&amp;B TO BLUES;

<P>
 ROBERT PALMER "DON'T EXPLAIN" EMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deep down, Palmer probably hates rock 'n' roll: It's probably just a means to 
an end for the dapper Englishman. He sings it rather dispassionately most of 
the time, although his two big rock hits, "Addicted to Love" and "Simply 
Irresistible" are exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer knows that if he throws a couple of rock songs on his albums, he can 
probably continue racking up best-sellers. You get the feeling he merely 
tolerates the rockers because their mass appeal allows him to sing what he 
really wants to sing, the quirky, quaint, vintage pop songs he really loves. 
</P>
<P>
Of the few rockers on "Don't Explain," none are above average, particularly the 
first single, "You're Amazing." But that doesn't mean this isn't a good album. 
Most of the music, though, is outside the pop-rock mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
This time Palmer really indulges his eclectic tastes, which include R&amp;B, 
blues, jazz, reggae and pre-'50s torch songs. Some arrangements, like the 
reggae/R&amp;B "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight," are outlandish. But most are 
subdued, allowing plenty of room for his subtle, quietly passionate crooning. 
The moody title song, done Billie Holiday style, is by far the best song in 
this hefty collection. 
</P>
<P>
Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five (a classic). DENNIS HUNT

RECORD RACK: 1/2 BERNADETTE COOPER "DRAMA ACCORDING TO BERNADETTE COOPER" MCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cooper's sense of humor may be cartoon-like, but her musical instincts are 
real-life sophisticated, and there's no other black female 
singer-songwriter-producer you can compare her to. If anything, she comes 
across as the audacious, self-absorbed female equivalent of Morris Day. 
</P>
<P>
Designed to be high-concept, this album is lacking in the drama department, 
save for "The Agency Sent Me," on which a harried social worker, frustrated by 
the court system and bureaucratic red tape, finds herself responding to a 
battered child who tells her: 
</P>
<P>
 I was born to be fierce 
</P>
<P>
 Born to be happy 
</P>
<P>
 Born to be free 
</P>
<P>
 Are you from the agency? 
</P>
<P>
 Lady, would you help me? 
</P>
<P>
 That cut is a poignant surprise from someone you don't associate with such 
serious concerns, and it's about as high-minded as Cooper gets. Actually, she's 
most convincing on "I Look Good," the best piece of self-promoting comedic-funk 
since Day and the Time cut "Cool" back in 1982. That track alone encapsulates 
everything you need to know about Cooper and her wonderfully wacky sense of 
musical invention. CONNIE JOHNSON

I've been a devoted fan of "China Beach" from the very beginning, and if 
anything the show is better than ever. I admire the producers for having the 
guts to break away from the status quo and explore new methods of storytelling. 
You couldn't get better writing, directing and acting than this season's 
"Fever" episode in which McMurphy returns home.

MAKE IT A QUALITY HOLIDAY WITH THE BEST IN CASSETTE AND DISC PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE SALTZMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christmas and Hanukkah 1990 promise to be a video holiday. 
</P>
<P>
There already are one or more videocassette recorders-64 million machines-in 
nearly 70% of all homes in the United States and that number will jump this 
holiday season as both first-time video buyers and consumers looking for a 
second VCR or laser video disc players crowd home video stores. 
</P>
<P>
More and more Americans are considering a VCR a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
If you have never bought a piece of home-video equipment before or if you want 
to upgrade your system, or simply want to add a second or third VCR, there are 
some things to bear in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Never buy a VCR with two heads no matter how cheap the machine (and you will 
find them for $200 or less). These machines simply do not adequately play back 
prerecorded tapes. If you want a cheap, second VHS machine, you can find a 
four-head VCR for $300 or less. Go with established manufacturers such as Sony, 
"CA, JVC or Zenith. 
</P>
<P>
The key question is what kind of VCR to buy. There are seven types: Super VHS, 
VHS Hi-Fi, conventional VHS, Beta, ED Beta, 8mm and Hi8. More than 300 
different VCRs fall into one of those groups. 
</P>
<P>
The smart money is to ignore all of the VCRs and jump into the laser video disc 
field buying a combination player that plays audio CDs as well as laser video 
discs. Prices range from less than $500 (a basic player) to as much as $4,500, 
a double-sided player with digital special effects and the best picture you can 
currently buy for the home. 
</P>
<P>
A laser disc machine that records is still several years away for the American 
consumer. Our choice until then: Pioneer CLD-3080 (less than $1,400), which 
plays both sides of the disc, offers digital special effects and has a S-Video 
Output (connectors designed to send color and brightness signals separately, 
resulting in an improved picture). 
</P>
<P>
If you must have a machine that records programs off the air and plays rental 
tapes, the best choice is a Super VHS machine that sells for about $1,500. 
Ed-Beta and Hi8 offer comparable pictures, but only a Super VHS machine will 
play those conventional VHS tapes. Our choice: Mitsubishi HS-U82 (less than 
$1,700). The Toshiba SV-F990 (less than $2,300) is also a nifty machine with 
digital effects and the most practical feature any new VCR can have: PIP, the 
picture-in-a-picture that puts an inset picture from a separate video source on 
a TV screen with a main picture. 
</P>
<P>
Before you buy, shop around. During the holiday season, prices will vary by 
several hundred dollars depending on the store's stock and sales policy. It 
doesn't hurt to shop at a store that offers service and installation. 
</P>
<P>
The optimum color television picture size for most homes is about 31 inches. 
Forget the traditional living-room cabinet and go for the new monitor-receivers 
with vastly superior picture resolution and direct audio/video inputs so you 
can easily connect your VCR and other components. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the bigger front projection and rear projection screens. Most are too 
big for the average room and next to most 31-inch models, they look anemic. Our 
choice: Proton VT-331 with the best-looking picture we've ever seen (less than 
$2,500). The 27-inch model (less than $1,500) is just as good, although the 
smaller picture does diminish the home video experience. If you never heard of 
Proton, don't worry. Just compare its picture to any other monitor-receiver and 
you'll be sold. It's that good. 
</P>
<P>
If you are to really enjoy the audio-video experience in 1990, it is essential 
that you combine your stereo system with your TV set. The picture may still be 
primitive compared to theatrical standards, but the sound can easily equal or 
surpass the performance of most movie theaters' sound systems. 
</P>
<P>
The most important thing to look for is an audio-video receiver or sound 
processor that includes Dolby Pro Logic. This multichannel configuration 
(front, center and surround channels) will change your routine TV viewing into 
something very special. 
</P>
<P>
Good choice for audio-video receiver: Pioneer VSX-9700S (less than $1,350) with 
all the bells and whistles available. Our choice for sound processor: Yamaha 
DSP-A700 (less than $1,000) together with the audio-video selector unit, Yamaha 
AVS-700. It's the best surround sound processor we've heard. Many experts are 
touting the new THX system from Lucasfilm. It's terrific, but the price tag is 
too high for most consumers' pocketbooks (Tehnics SH-TX100, about $12,000). 
</P>
<P>
Whether you are looking for a bargain VHS machine with minimum performance or 
state-of-the-art magic flirting with digital freeze-frame and broadcast stereo 
sound, there's plenty to choose from in 1990's avalanche of video products. 
</P>
<P>
The VCR, like the television set before it, has irrevocably changed the 
American home: 
</P>
<P>
With cable and pay-TV offering an unprecedented variety of product and the 
price of movie rentals falling to less than a buck a day, it's the perfect time 
to join the millions of consumers who have created a home entertainment center 
that a decade ago was only a pipe dream.

HAVE YOURSELF A VERY VIDEO CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

can own

<TEXT>
<P>
If you want pictures with your Christmas music, there are plenty of videotapes 
and discs available. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most beautiful Yuletide music videos is Carols for Christmas, a 
video filled with appropriately inspirational paintings from the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art and an audio track filled with the Royal College of Music Chamber 
Choir singing traditional carols conducted by Sir David Willocks. 
</P>
<P>
The video's dramatic backdrop is St. Edmundsbury Cathedral. The program is 
available on videotape (HBO, 60 minutes), but it is vastly superior on a 
Pioneer Artists laser video disc. If you have a laser video machine, just play 
this disc continuously. 
</P>
<P>
Equally as stirring, but not as visually interesting is The New Born King, a 
program of traditional carols from Westminster Cathedral (Video Arts 
International tape). The singing is gorgeous- with baritone Benjamin Luxon, 
Aled Jones (a boy soprano) and the Westminster Cathedral. The late actor Emlyn 
Williams reads excerpts from Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
The Christmas Carol Video (Creative Programming tape) features the Choir of the 
Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York singing 14 carols, including 
"Silent Night." The well-photographed video includes a Christmas montage of the 
choir, stained-glass windows and New England snow scenes including kids 
building snowmen and families decorating trees. 
</P>
<P>
A Classical Christmas (Kultur tape) is a painless tour of familiar Christmas 
scenes (ice skaters, Christmas lights, the holiday art work of Currier and 
Ives, Santa Claus and the like) accompanied by familiar Christmas music in 
routine performances. 
</P>
<P>
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir: Christmas Classics (Vestron tape) is the Utah 
singers' first live music video album. "Joy to the World" is included. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas songs sung by great classical singers have been best-sellers for 
years on records. Now, several have made the transition to video. Kiri te 
Kanawa at Christmas (V.I.E.W. tape) features the popular soprano with the 
Tallis Chamber Choir. Mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade offers Christmas With 
Flicka (V.I.E.W. tape) with Julius Rudel conducting. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas With Luciano Pavarotti (Video Treasures) is a disappointing tape 
because the video quality is so awful. But Pavarotti is Pavarotti and even in 
blurry pictures and terrible monaural sound, the tenor soars on such classics 
as "Ave Maria," "Silent Night" and "O Holy Night." 
</P>
<P>
No one would dare sing along with these videos, so if you want a Christmas 
sing-along, pick up a copy of Holiday Sing-Along With Mitch Miller and the 
Sing-Along Gang (MGM/UA tape). It offers everything from "Jingle Bells" to 
"White Christmas" in versions that will make any shower baritone or soprano 
feel right at home. 
</P>
<P>
In 1951, Gian Carlo Menotti and NBC-TV gave the nation a very special Christmas 
gift, the premiere of Amahl and the Night Visitors. A 1979 "Hallmark Hall of 
Fame" television special of the one-act opera is available (Video Artists 
International tape). The singers, happily, are also actors. Soprano Teresa 
Stratas (a diva in the Maria Callas mold) as the mother, and Robert Sapolsky (a 
boy soprano) as a serious Amahl, are quite moving in this sweetly sung and 
nicely acted production. The Philharmonic Orchestra is conducted by Jesus 
Lopez-Cobos with Metropolitan Opera singers Giorgio Tozzi, Nico Castel and 
Willard White. 
</P>
<P>
No Christmas would be complete without Tchaikovsky's "The Nutcracker" ballet. 
There are quite a few from which to choose. The Nutcracker to get is Mikhail 
Baryshnikov's sparkling version with the American Ballet Theatre, featuring 
Baryshnikov and Gelsey Kirkland (MGM/UA tape or Pioneer Artists' laser video 
disc with digital sound). In Baryshnikov's version, the ballet becomes a 
child's dream with a handsome prince, a wicked Mouse King, a princess, dancing 
snowflakes, flowers and the Nutcracker. 
</P>
<P>
Also available: an authentic Bolshoi Ballet version filmed in 1978 at the 
Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow with Yekaterina Maximova and Vladimir Vasilev (Kultur 
tape); a Royal Ballet version starring Lesley Collier and Anthony Dowell with 
Gennady Rozhdestvensky conducting (HBO and Home Vision tapes and Pioneer 
Artists laser video disc), and "The Nutcracker: The Movie" (Paramount tape), a 
production designed by Maurice Sendak, the illustrator of enchanting children's 
books. The imaginative costumes and scenery far outshine the rather pedestrian 
production. 
</P>
<P>
For non-purists, there is "The Nutcracker: A Fantasy on Ice," which stars 
skaters Dorothy Hamill and Rolen Cousins with a narration by the late actor 
Lorne Greene (Vestron tape). 
</P>
<P>
If you would rather have a country-Western Christmas, there's a video version 
of Dolly Parton's annual TV special A Smoky Mountain Christmas (Playhouse 
tape). It's all about Dolly, a Tennessee cabin and seven orphans (no, they are 
not named Grumpy, Sneezy, Doc and Dopey). Parton is in good voice and spirits. 
</P>
<P>
If one of your warmest memories is sitting by the fireplace watching your 
Christmas stockings and listening to carols, and you live in a place where 
there are no fireplaces, or you're too lazy to buy some wood and start a fire, 
why not turn your TV set into a warm, cozy fireplace? 
</P>
<P>
Your Christmas Yule Log Fireplace is a 59-minute video that does the trick 
(Video Naturals). You can enjoy a roaring Yuletide fire without ever leaving 
your chair. As "The 12 Days of Christmas" fills the room, a poker jabs the logs 
in the hearth. During "O Come All Ye Faithful," someone tosses more wood on the 
fire. You don't move a muscle. During "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies," the 
logs snap, crackle and pop. 
</P>
<P>
It may just be that "Your Christmas Yule Log Fireplace" is the perfect video 
and audio Muzak for the holiday season. JOE SALTZMAN Next week: Christmas 
videos for children and holiday movies you can own

Q &amp; A: PIERRE SAUVAGE: DOCUMENTING HEROES OF THE HOLOCAUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan King 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Film-maker Pierre Sauvage, who is Jewish, was born 47 years ago in 
Nazi-occupied France in Le Chambon, a tiny farming village in the mountains 
about 350 miles southeast of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, thousands of Jews were being turned over by the French to the 
Germans for deportation. But the small Protestant peasant community became a 
refuge for more than 5,000 Jews, many of them children. No one in the village 
ever betrayed the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, Sauvage returned to Le Chambon to make "Weapons of the 
Spirit," the acclaimed feature documentary about the townspeople who saved 
thousands of lives, including his own. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, PBS premieres "Weapons of the Spirit," preceded by an 
introduction by journalist Bill Moyers and a Moyers interview with Sauvage. 
</P>
<P>
Sauvage discussed his odyssey of making "Weapons of the Spirit" with Susan 
King. 
</P>
<P>
Did the world know of Le Chambon until your film? 
</P>
<P>
There was a book written about 10 years ago, but by and large, until the film, 
the story remained very obscure. 
</P>
<P>
Was this film something you had planned for several years? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I decided to do it pretty quickly and was able to start shooting 
pretty quickly. But unfortunately, I only had the resources to shoot, not to 
edit or put it together, so that was a problem throughout the rest of the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
But in addition, it was simply a difficult subject for me to understand. I 
really hadn't been, in a sense, prepared to deal with such a subject. I come 
from a very anti-religious background, and here I was planning to make a film 
in praise of committed Christians. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-religious? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I was brought up in an extremely un-Jewish home, insofar as my parents 
kept the fact they were Jewish a secret. In fact they kept it from me. I only 
learned I was Jewish when I was 18. The film was an attempt to connect with an 
identity and with roots which had been severed. 
</P>
<P>
It must have been an amazing experience then to go back to the town where you 
were born. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, every trip back there has been an amazing experience. That trip to 
make the film was an extraordinary experience. For anybody to be able to 
reconstruct the circumstances of his or her birth is lucky under any 
circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
In my case, it was a historical event of some importance, but there was also 
the mere challenge of making the film and concern if these people would 
cooperate. It was so much against their nature to talk about what they did, to 
attach importance to it, and here I was asking them to not just to talk about 
it, but to lend me their own photographs and allow me to make them characters 
in a film. That was certainly of great concern to them. 
</P>
<P>
Did it take you a long time to win their confidence? 
</P>
<P>
I can't say it actually took a long time, but I started with people that I knew 
already. I started with people who had helped my parents. They weren't going to 
turn me down. I think when people found out that I had been born there, there 
was a sense of trust that developed very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the documentary, one is struck by the fact the townspeople seem so 
matter-of-fact about what they did. 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly right. That was the single most surprising thing I learned about 
them in the course of trying to understand all of this better. People who do 
such things with their lives under any circumstance are far from being people 
who agonize over the decision and make a big deal about it. 
</P>
<P>
They are people who do it because it appears to them to be the only thing to do 
and hence, when they express surprise when people consider it a big deal, this 
isn't modesty. They are doing what comes naturally to them. And they can't 
understand how anybody could consider that they would have done anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Have many of the Jews who were hidden by the townspeople returned? 
</P>
<P>
There are a number who have returned periodically. There was a reunion, in 
fact, which took place in October which was a big event. It was also the 
occasion of the local premiere of my film. It was the first time the villagers 
were seeing the film. 
</P>
<P>
What was their reaction? 
</P>
<P>
It was a very exciting experience. The most important thing to me was that they 
liked the film. I don't think there was any other approval that mattered more 
to me than theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The film, while attempting to preserve their simplicity, underscores how 
special they were for us. And I knew that would make some of them 
uncomfortable, but I think they measured that I had tried not to make cardboard 
heroes out of them and not to sentimentalize them. They were very responsive. 
That was very moving to me. 
</P>
<P>
Is the film currently in theaters in France? 
</P>
<P>
At the same time we had the premiere in Le Chambon, it was opening in Paris. It 
is doing well. I think that the response by people in the audience has been 
extremely good. The response by the press has been very good, but hesitant. 
These are still subjects that the French are not thrilled to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
The reviews have all been favorable, but some of them have been small. It's not 
being trumpeted as a big event, but maybe that's the way a film like this has 
to make its way in France -- settling in a movie theater for a long run. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of young people have no idea what happened during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
I think that's true. When it comes to the Holocaust, I think it's very hard for 
people and even for Jews to gravitate to the subject. It's very depressing and 
it's very scary. I think a key way is to learn about it through these people. 
It indicates what is possible for people to do. 
</P>
<P>
And I think we desperately need that knowledge. I think we live in very cynical 
times. There are great doubts about people's capacity to act well. In fact, I 
think we are more cynical about a community's capacity to act well. The idea 
that a whole city or town or village would almost instinctively band together 
to do the right thing would quite astonish a lot of people. But it is possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Weapons of the Spirit" airs Wednesday at 8 p.m. on Channel 50, 9 p.m. on 
Channel 28, 9:35 p.m. on Channel 15 and 10 p.m. on Channel 24.

ART WORLD: SOVIET ARTIST SURFACES AT USC GALLERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW

<TEXT>
<P>
FACES 
</P>
<P>
"In art you need some tragedy. Where would we be without that?" asks 
Leningrad-based painter Gleb Bogomolov, referring to a 40-year period in which, 
he says, the development of Russian art was "completely cut off." 
</P>
<P>
Bogomolov should know about that tragedy in Russian art; he has long been 
recognized as a leader of the Soviet Union's underground art scene. But 
Bogomolov was one of the lucky ones. He has been able to make an underground 
living through his work, which he has been selling to foreign diplomats and 
collectors for more than 10 years -- long before Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is included in "Keepers of the Flame: Unofficial Artists of Leningrad" 
at USC's Fisher Gallery through Jan. 19. In addition, he has his first Los 
Angeles solo show at George Mayers Gallery on La Cienega Boulevard through Dec. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
"My condition has not changed, except that now I can go abroad, I can travel 
with my works," says the artist, who is currently on his first visit to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although his English is excellent, the 57-year-old artist with the ready grin 
insists on using an interpreter so that the "subtle nuances" of his 
conversation will be understood. Frequently, however, he finds himself helping 
out the interpreter with those very nuances. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, since being officially "recognized" by the Soviet 
government, Bogomolov has shown at several prestigious Soviet institutions, 
among them the Russian Museum, Far East Museum, Museum of Leningrad and 
Moscow's Museum of Modern Art. He has also shown in Norway and Sweden, and is 
currently featured in the large-scale exhibition "The Quest for 
Self-Expression: Painting in Moscow and Leningrad, 1965-1990" at Ohio's 
Columbus Museum of Art. But times were not always so easy for the artist, who 
left his state job as an engineer 13 years ago to devote himself to life as an 
underground artist. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do something contrary to society," Bogomolov remembers. "Before 
perestroika, we were to be a (slave) to what we were told. But I was always 
doing what I wanted to do. I was supposed to work officially, but I didn't want 
to do it, even though they could imprison me for having no official job. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult trying to be an artist. They tried to stop my work," 
continues Bogomolov, who had no formal art training, but began making art while 
still a child. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always striving for avant-garde work," he says. Bogomolov did not become 
an "official artist," he says, because he did not want to always paint what he 
was told to, or paint in the official style of Socialist Realism. 
</P>
<P>
He notes, however, that because his work relies heavily on old Russian icons, 
he may be seen more as following old traditions that new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the avant-garde often leans on old traditions," he says. "I 
always turn to the tradition of icon painting because I think our modern times 
and ancient culture are very connected to each other. We have the literal 
result now of what was happening in ancient times." 
</P>
<P>
In his mixed-media paintings, Bogomolov often depicts "only vague remains of 
something that is not understood" thus causing the viewer to "guess" the 
piece's meaning. Such is the case with "Shrine," a work included in the USC 
show, which features only one clear element, a hand of playing cards 
representing "absolute mockery and a challenge that takes away from old history 
and culture." 
</P>
<P>
"I think (works like this) are a consequence of my experiences of spiritual 
tragedy," Bogomolov says of the suffering he underwent as an "unofficial" 
artist in the Soviet Union before Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENTS

AN OFFICE ROMANCE BLOOMS; 
</P>
<P>
THE PALM COURT HAS WON OVER THE LOCAL WORKING CROWD BY DAY, BUT ITS SPLENDID 
ISOLATION DRAWS FROM FAR AFIELD AT DINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, Charles Perry is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Splendid isolation, you could call this. Splendid, certainly: The Palm Court is 
all high ceilings and great sheets of marble and glass. It sports a reflecting 
pool and, needless to say, a decent stand of palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
But isolation, for sure. It's in the enclosed courtyard of a huge office 
building, part of a regular forest of office buildings at the corner of Santa 
Monica and Sepulveda boulevards. When the restaurant opened in late spring, it 
was only for breakfast and lunch, two hours when it has the neighborhood office 
workers pretty much to itself. 
</P>
<P>
Recently it opened for dinner as well -- a big step, because at dinner the Palm 
Court has to lure people from far away. Actually, it's not particularly remote, 
only a block or two east of the San Diego Freeway (depending on whether you 
count tiny Pontius Street), but a deserted business district always feels like 
the far side of the moon after dark. Fortunately, the underground parking in 
the Palm Court's own building alleviates the spookiness, and fortunately, the 
food is worth a drive. 
</P>
<P>
What sort of food is it? The kind that makes it hard to ignore the fact that 
the Palm Court is owned by Parties Plus, the major-league catering service. 
This feels like top-flight caterer's food: versatile, eclectic and serenely up 
to date. Chef Rich Kitos may very well be making personal culinary statements 
here, but inevitably you suspect Parties Plus' sensitive finger on the pulse of 
L.A. taste. 
</P>
<P>
To put it another way: Though it has hints of French, Japanese, Central 
American and even plain old American cooking, this is basically a menu drenched 
with Italian influence. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from breakfast, that is. Breakfast caters to the usual American a.m. 
ambivalence -- healthful grains or luxurious eggs? -- though in novel ways. You 
can get a sort of conceptual hash: a crab cake with browned cubed potatoes and 
startlingly fresh poached eggs, not mixed together but arranged side by side on 
the plate. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest of the day, this is a restaurant enthusiastically part of an age 
when there must be olive oil and a basket of fresh breads at the table (here 
the basket includes a delicious white bread with swirls of olive paste in it). 
There must be pasta and radicchio and bufalla mozzarella on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
But our town is not looking for Italian cuisine as such; we want all those 
excellent foods, but we want them on our own terms: that is, not necessarily in 
strict antipasto-pasta-entree order, and with non-Italian options and extras. 
Particularly at dessert, when we prefer things French or American. 
</P>
<P>
So at lunch there's a polenta of the day, at dinner there's a risotto of the 
day. (You can get polenta at dinner as well, with a rich sauce of spinach and 
Italian bacon, but it's fried polenta, like mere fried cornmeal mush; at lunch 
the polenta has a light texture of unmatched tenderness.) 
</P>
<P>
But since we want our options and extras, at lunch, the Palm Court serves 
ravioli with a stuffing that includes ricotta and sun-dried tomato -- and also 
goat cheese, that cheese of the age. At breakfast and dinner you can get a 
pupusa, the Salvadoran cornmeal pancake stuffed with -- an Italian touch -- 
ricotta. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, given the wide influence antipasto has had on our tables, none of the 
dinner appetizers seems Italian. The mussel chowder is a cousin of clam 
chowder, and the soup of the day might be potato soup with bits of smoked 
turkey and crunchy, barely cooked chunks of carrot and green beans. Salmon 
gyoza looks like ravioli, large and flat with scalloped edges, but you taste 
soy rather than butter in the sauce. The most appealing appetizer is the seared 
tuna served on slices of cantaloupe sprinkled with black mustard seed, all in a 
delicate Japanese ponzu vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
The menu lists "antipasti," but what it calls by that name is a plate of three 
sandwich-like tidbits: anchovy between slices of eggplant and roasted red 
pepper, garlicky ricotta between slices of zucchini, and mozzarella between 
slices of green tomato. It's Italian ingredients subjected to the 
Franco-Japanese treatment rather than anything the world knows as antipasto. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the entrees occasionally have the feeling of antipasti: 
plates with various savory ingredients arranged together for ad lib nibbling, 
combinations that neither clash nor form close harmonies. They're looser and 
more casual arrangements than the marriage of flavors French chefs 
traditionally aim at. I'm thinking of "salmon paillard," for which the 
thin-sliced salmon is not grilled over a flame like chicken paillard, but under 
it, searing it to the plate. It's topped (despite the menu's nattering about 
various herbs) with baby asparagus, long spears of chives and a salad of diced 
cucumber and yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
The most attractive entree is lamb chops with rosemary, garlic, mint and basil, 
with a sauce of port wine and balsamic vinegar. This sounds like one of those 
dishes with about three ingredients too many, but the result is subtle and 
intriguing, as if some new ingredient had been discovered -- perhaps some 
unheard-of cousin of the kumquat. I'm not quite sure, however, what the fried 
mashed potato patty (which the menu calls "rosti potatoes") is doing to earn 
its seat on this plate. Pleasant though it is. 
</P>
<P>
There's a straightforward and not un-Italianate stew of shellfish piled high in 
a bowl and garnished with herb-flavored fritters, and a rugged peasanty dish of 
roasted chicken with Calamata olives and garlic. The medallions of turkey 
piccata are like a light, clean-tasting veal piccata (though the slices of 
turkey, in a delicate egg batter, are rather thick), garnished with slightly 
jarring sections of bitter-sweet caramelized lemon. It's a little like a 
piccata with chutney. Sometimes on special there's a swordfish piccata that's 
more like the traditional item. 
</P>
<P>
And then the menu lists a couple of wild California-style leaps of faith. The 
double duck breast comes in a sweetish sauce that seems to have ground onion in 
it; perfectly nice, but the cornmeal crepes that accompany it are filled with 
fig, suggesting ever so slightly that a Fig Newton or two has fallen into the 
gravy. The grilled prime rib is supposed to come with garlic and horseradish 
sauce and sundried cherries, but the reality I had was happily more down to 
earth: The beef came in a meaty sauce and was topped with some roasted garlic 
cloves. 
</P>
<P>
The Palm Court continues to serve one of the best chocolate ice creams around. 
Its apple pie is always huge, but the recipe has taken its time finding itself. 
I've had it with a dense filling, evidently including bread crumbs between the 
apple slices, and I've had it with solid masses of apple, and once I had it 
with a distinct overdose of clove and nutmeg. The crust has always been fresh 
and good, though, and the latest model is hard to fault. 
</P>
<P>
There's always a brown butter tart, with a buttery, slightly chewy crust and a 
seasonal fruit filling, and a chocolate mousse cake with a cherry filling that 
comes in triangular slices. Neither of these stands head and shoulders above 
this city's dessert crowd, but in their humble way the Palm Court's cookies do. 
You get a selection that might include some chocolate cookies -- one with a 
dash of mint flavor, the other with white chocolate bits in it -- and some 
peanut butter cookies, possibly frosted with chocolate, and a perfect oatmeal 
cookie. 
</P>
<P>
Cookies? OK, cookies. Even when the Palm Court is being self-consciously 
experimental, there's always something genial and down to earth about its food. 
The main problem I see with the place is getting used to the idea of the corner 
of Sepulveda and Santa Monica as restaurant territory.

HAMMER'S MUSEUM

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Knight's criticism of Hammer is unjust and unfounded. When the Daumier 
collection was housed at LACMA, the director could not be bothered to see that 
titles and captions were correctly translated; you never knew what hideous 
howler would greet you (I remember "Une Meprise a l'Odeon" given as "A Wicked 
Man at the Odeon" instead of "A Mistake at the Odeon"). 
</P>
<P>
LACMA's gross negligence cannot be hidden by continual and continually 
uninspired construction. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Hammer has done what any intelligent man would do -- he has taken his 
Leonardo codex, his Daumiers and his Van Gogh from a place where they were not 
wanted.

Re Kenneth Turan's Dec. 2 article on Paul Newman: How dare Turan accuse one 
responsible for so many critically and commercially successful films of 
breaking an unspoken bargain with his audience and foolishly trying to broaden 
his horizons. 
</P>
<P>
The roles Mr. Newman played in "The Hustler," "Hud" and "The Verdict" are 
outstanding character performances, not just performances that remain close to 
audience expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" introduces much of Newman's audience to classic American 
literature, and some of that on the screen is better than none.

Mr. Turan says Oscar Wilde wrote "The Importance of Being Ernest." Wilde's 
masterpiece is "The Importance of Being Earnest." Perhaps Mr. Turan should 
"stretch" himself in the field of the arts before sitting down to carp about 
others.

It's a long bow shot better than its antecedents ("A Man Called Horse," etc.) 
in capturing the Sioux Indian Nation's culture.

Now what next? Well, for every white who took the blanket, there were at least

When star actors are discouraged from taking risks, many unfortunately resort 
to roles that are far beneath them.

JAMES FLANIGAN: THERE'S PLENTY OF EVIDENCE THAT THE U.S. ISN'T IN RECESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is this really a recession or another case of New York media hype? 
</P>
<P>
The question is smart-aleck but appropriate because the economic news is 
indecisive. There are signs of serious weakness, but also evidence of 
surprising strength. A lot depends on where you live. 
</P>
<P>
It feels bad on Wall Street, where thousands of brokerage house employees have 
been let go with the end of the 1980s financial services boom. And that has had 
a ripple effect in New York and the Northeast, where real estate prices are 
falling, banks are hurting and retail sales are weak. 
</P>
<P>
But the effect is magnified because media attentions make New York's joys and 
sorrows seem more important than those of other places. It was that way in the 
1980s, when severe economic suffering hit farming and manufacturing in the 
Middle West and the oil and gas industry in the Southwest. People lost jobs, 
lives were rearranged. 
</P>
<P>
Yet farmers and factory workers were not the symbols of the decade. That's too 
bad because they might have sent a cautionary message -- farmers on the dangers 
of leverage in farmland and factory workers on the hard realities of world 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, their struggles were pigeon-holed with words such as Rustbelt and Oil 
Patch. The symbol of the decade was the yuppie investment banker, making 
millions on inflated expectations and borrowed money in the "bull market" on 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the bull market is over, the investment bankers are out of work, and so a 
wail has gone up about a nationwide recession. 
</P>
<P>
But recession is not evident nationwide. In fact, places that struggled in the 
'80s feel a lot better today. Farming is healthier, manufacturing has 
modernized. In cities such as Cleveland and Milwaukee, where industry has 
diversified, retail sales are surprisingly strong. In Houston, employment is 
growing and real estate is climbing back from depression. 
</P>
<P>
Job loss statistics reflect the geographic differences. "Workplace Trends," a 
Cleveland-based newsletter, says 41% of corporate staff cuts this year have 
occurred in the Northeast-New York area. Elsewhere, job losses are scattered: 
12% around Detroit, 6% for the Chicago area and 12% for the whole West Coast, 
from Seattle to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Layoffs in Southern California's defense industry are not included in those 
figures, but even here joblessness has not mounted in other industries. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the economy is growing very slowly -- and may be slipping into 
recession, as the latest national unemployment figures and the Federal Reserve 
Board suggested last week. And, of course, the Persian Gulf crisis is a wild 
card. But fears that are sometimes heard today of economic collapse and 
worldwide depression are overblown. 
</P>
<P>
Why are such fears heard at all? Because people who have never lost their jobs 
feel that they are in danger of losing them now. "Whatever you call it, this 
won't be a typical recession," says Adrian Dillon, chief economist for Eaton 
Corp., a manufacturer of auto parts and electrical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
This time, in addition to moderate factory layoffs, cutbacks are coming in 
services. Banks and insurance companies, advertising agencies and accounting 
firms, retail stores and airlines are all cutting employees. And that's not to 
mention other firms in real estate and construction, business consulting and 
the hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
That's unusual. In normal recessions, apart from workers idled by construction 
cutbacks, service employees sail through the bad times with little discomfort. 
But this is shaping up to be a "services recession," says Charles Clough, chief 
investment strategist for Merrill Lynch. "We'll find we don't need as many 
lawyers, real estate brokers, advertising copywriters -- or investment 
strategists." 
</P>
<P>
That's not a pleasant thought, because more than 75% of the 117 million people 
in the labor force work in services. Job losses therefore could be widely 
spread and lingering -- meaning the downturn might be long and annoying, like a 
persistent backache. 
</P>
<P>
Still, services are being hit with cutbacks for good, economic reasons -- they 
haven't been as productive as they should be. While U.S. manufacturing in the 
last decade has made historic gains of 4% a year in output per labor hour, a 
lag in services has reduced overall U.S. productivity gains to near zero. The 
society is poorer because of inefficiency in services. 
</P>
<P>
Consider just a few examples from the '80s. Costs of medical services went up 
dramatically, but the economic payoff in better health -- as measured by 
longevity and infant mortality rates -- wasn't there. Other countries get 
better health care for less expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
Another example is 24-hour supermarkets. Stores stayed open longer, adding 
staff, keeping checkout stands working, but didn't sell a proportionately 
greater amount of groceries. So overall store productivity fell -- although 
such inefficient use of resources may have convenienced customers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, deals made at inflated values with government-insured savings and loan 
deposits have yielded thousands of less-than-productive hotels, motels and 
retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
Now the reckoning has come. The '90s will see the non-productive fat wrung from 
services -- as the last 10 years saw the restructuring of manufacturing and oil 
drilling. Banks and other financial service businesses are already shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that productivity will rise, and the economy's tendency toward 
inflation will come down. This means interest rates will fall and the economy 
will resume its growth -- within a year, say experts. 
</P>
<P>
To repeat the question: Is this really a recession? Perhaps a better 
description would be a therapeutic purge for a basically sound and always 
changing economy.

BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON: STRONG U.S. FIRMS KEY TO HEALTHY 
WORLD ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON, LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON is a professor of economics and 
business administration at UC Berkeley and director of its Institute for 
International Studies. This piece is adapted from a longer article They Are Not 
Us: Why American Ownership Matters in The American Prospect journal. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like "Engine" Charlie Wilson, General Motors' colorful chief executive in more 
innocent times, most Americans intuitively assume that what is good for 
American companies is good for the nation. The competitiveness of the U.S. 
economy, most Americans believe, results from the competitive vigor of 
U.S.-based corporations. 
</P>
<P>
This identity of interests has been so widely taken for granted that only a few 
theoreticians of the obvious, such as Engine Charlie and Calvin ("The business 
of America is business") Coolidge, have ever felt a need to mention it. 
</P>
<P>
But whether that self-evident premise makes sense today is not so clear. As 
American companies become more global and as foreign companies move more of 
their production to the United States, we must re-examine those assumed links 
between the interests of companies and the interests of the nation and its 
citizens. In the words of Robert Reich, a noted political economist at 
Harvard's Kennedy School of Gvernment, we must ask: "Who is us?" 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, despite the current infatuation with globalization, the evidence 
confirms the old intuition. To a significant extent, "we" are still "us" -- the 
competitiveness of the U.S. economy remains tightly linked to the 
competitiveness of U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. multinationals still locate the lion's share of their worldwide operations 
in the United States. In 1988, the last year for which data is available, U.S. 
parent operations accounted for 78% of total assets, 70% of total sales and 70% 
of total employment of U.S. multinationals in the manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the domestic operations of U.S. multinationals provided more 
productive and higher-paying jobs than their foreign operations. Compensation 
per employee in parent operations was about 17% higher than in affiliate 
operations in developed countries and about 360% higher than in affiliate 
operations in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
American companies also continue to spend most of their research and 
development dollars at home. In 1988, for example, the proportion of total 
R&amp;D spending by U.S. companies that took place overseas was only 8.6%. And 
despite innumerable speeches by American corporate leaders on the globalization 
of American business, most large American companies do not have any foreigners 
on their boards. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, many American companies have made huge investments abroad, attracted 
by lower wages, less demanding social and environmental standards and protected 
foreign markets. But these investments have not necessarily weakened domestic 
economic competitiveness. Indeed, the presumption should run the other way. 
Since American multinationals continue to locate most of their high-quality 
production activities at home, the beneficial competitive effects of their 
overseas operations spill over into more and better jobs, higher profits, lower 
prices and improved products for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
But if American companies are still "us," what about the foreign multinationals 
that have established affiliate operations in the United States. Can they also 
claim to be "us?" 
</P>
<P>
In important ways, the affiliates of foreign companies operating in the United 
States resemble the domestic operations of American companies. Foreign 
affiliates are, on the average, virtually indistinguishable from domestic firms 
in output per worker, compensation per worker and R&amp;D spending per worker. 
Foreign firms do import significantly more than domestic companies, but this 
difference is likely to decline over time as foreign companies rely more on 
networks of local U.S suppliers for their inputs. 
</P>
<P>
Although they appear to resemble American companies, foreign affiliates still 
represent a relatively small fraction of total economic activity within the 
United States, accounting for only about 11% of total manufacturing output and 
about 9% of total manufacturing employment in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
While foreign firms represent growing shares of the domestic economy, 
especially in a few major industries such as automobiles and consumer 
electronics, they are still not as important as American firms. "They" are not 
yet "us," although they are beginning to bear a strong family resemblance. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, globalization is here to stay. Over time, U.S. companies are 
likely to send larger shares of their operations abroad, while foreign 
companies are likely to bring more of their economic activity here. And as 
flows of investment become ever more important relative to flows of trade, the 
rivalry between the United States and the other developed countries will 
increasingly take the form of locational competition -- vying with one another 
for shares of the world's high-technology production base regardless of 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
In a world of global companies, the overarching goal of U.S. policy should be 
American competitiveness -- the capacity of Americans to add value to the world 
economy and thereby gain a higher standard of living without going further into 
debt. With this goal in mind, national economic policies should be formulated 
to make the United States an attractive production location for the 
high-productivity, high-wage, research-intensive activities for both domestic 
and foreign firms. 
</P>
<P>
This requires a policy agenda that gives priority to enhancing the education 
and skills of the American work force, to building America's economic 
infrastructure and to fostering research and development. The nation's human 
capital, infrastructure and research base are its most important immovable 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
As a general rule the United States should continue to welcome foreign 
investment for both antitrust and national security purposes. All other nations 
do the same. 
</P>
<P>
It is also sensible to invoke the principle of reciprocity under some 
circumstances. If American firms are kept out of foreign markets by overt 
discriminatory trade or investment barriers, the United States should demand 
that those barriers be reduced as the price for access to the American 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
The principle of reciprocity is also applicable to public support for research 
and development. The United States should make publicly funded R&amp;D programs 
available on the same terms to any company regardless of national origin, 
provided the home country reciprocates. Both domestic and foreign companies 
receiving public R&amp;D monies should be required to spend them in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
For example, U.S. policies to support generic R&amp;D for high-definition 
television should be open to both domestic and foreign companies, so long as 
they agree to do the research here and so long as similar programs in their 
home countries are open to U.S. firms. In high-definition TV, as in other 
high-technology pursuits, we cannot afford to rely on national champions alone 
when foreign ones such as Sony, Philips and Thomson already have substantial 
R&amp;D facilities here. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, America's strength in high-technology industries still depends 
disproportionately on American firms, even those whose large overseas 
operations have contributed to the growing high-tech strength of America's 
major trading partners. Moreover, America's ability to compete with other 
nations for the investment and R&amp;D activities of foreign multinationals 
depends in part on the health of American companies. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign firms feel that they need to be near their healthy American competitors 
to key into their knowledge and the network of skilled people who carry that 
knowledge with them. The major attraction to foreign investors is the health of 
the domestic economy; that in turn depends on the health of domestic companies. 
</P>
<P>
The world economy is in a state of transition. National boundaries are growing 
ever more meaningless. Globalization is a trend that promises to define the 
next century. But at present, the United States is still "us."

At least one part of state government isn't inflicted with a budget ailment. As 
lawmakers grapple with an estimated $4.3-billion state budget deficit, the 
Unemployment Insurance Fund has $5.6 billion in reserves. Financial analysts 
say the plump unemployment kitty should be more than enough to cover the costs 
of a climbing jobless rate. 
</P>
<P>
Mandated by a federal law but administered by the state, the 55-year-old fund 
is responsible for paying out unemployment insurance benefits to workers who 
have lost their jobs. The fund was created in 1935 to protect workers from the 
worst ravages of unemployment and keep money flowing through the economy. 
</P>
<P>
After eight years of strong growth, the California fund has a record high 
balance -- it has nearly doubled in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, when the unemployment rate rises, the tax will go up, which shores up the 
fund. The number of people receiving unemployment insurance benefits has 
increased to 386,700 in 1990 from 293,400 in 1989 because of a sharp increase 
in layoffs in the state. A year ago, 721,000 California workers were out of 
work; today, 884,000 are. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 1, the ceiling for unemployment insurance benefits will jump to $210 
from $190 a week. In 1992, it will go up to $230. 
</P>
<P>
When lawmakers were negotiating the benefits last year, "the arguments were the 
same," said Carol Ross, research director at the California Taxpayers Assn. in 
Sacramento. "Labor wanted higher benefits and said the fund was too fat, and 
business said reduce the tax and save the surplus for a rainy day." 
</P>
<P>
After the two sides agreed on a new benefits and tax formula, they finally got 
the governor's support with a bill that increased benefits but also tightened 
up who is entitled to unemployment insurance. Nationwide, there is concern that 
the number of jobless collecting unemployment is shrinking. But in California, 
the percentage of unemployed who receive benefits has jumped to 43% today from 
36% in 1984. That could decrease with the new eligibility requirements, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Jan. 1, new rules require unemployed workers to have earnings of at 
least $1,250 in any three-month period of their previous jobs. This is up from 
$1,200. It will increase to $1,300 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
California still has lower unemployment benefits than most other states. Its 
average is $127 a week, which ranks California 37th among all states. The 
highest benefits are paid in Massachusetts, with an average weekly benefit of 
$211. 
</P>
<P>
The unemployment insurance fund is often hailed for its fairness to employers. 
Businesses that have high turnover have a higher tax rate; those that keep 
workers for a long period pay the least. 
</P>
<P>
California businesses pay two unemployment insurance taxes: a 0.8% federal tax 
on the first $7,000 of income for each employee, which covers the costs of 
administering the federal and state unemployment insurance program. A state tax 
covers the cost of benefits and ranges from 0.1% to 5.4% on the first $7,000 of 
taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing Yields More, Better Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Communities interested in creating more jobs, higher incomes and more sales 
should recruit a big manufacturing plant -- not a supermarket or a computer 
research facility -- a new study by the state Department of Commerce says. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "The Economic Benefits of 100 New Jobs," the analysis examines the 
benefits a new business with 100 employees would bring to a community. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is that the multiplier effect from 100 manufacturing jobs is 
much greater than the economic spinoff from retail or service industries. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a new supermarket in the San Joaquin Valley that employs 100 
workers would generate 67 more jobs in the community, but a manufacturing 
facility, such as a food processer, would spawn 480 more jobs. Also, food 
processing workers earn 54% higher salaries than retail clerks in the San 
Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
For those cities that are hungry for tax revenue, however, retail is a better 
option. The food processing plant will generate an estimated $320 million in 
tax revenue, while the supermarket brings in $761 million in tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
But "if the choice is manufacturing or service jobs, manufacturing is still the 
way to go," said Lance Barnett, chief economist of the Department of Commerce 
in Sacramento. "Manufacturing gives workers a better job ladder to earn more 
and move up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the drop in manufacturing nationwide, Barnett said, the sector is 
strong in California. In the past 10 years, manufacturing employment rolls grew 
to 2,158,000 from 2,018,000, and the state's share of manufacturing jobs 
nationwide climbed from 8% to 11%.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: WEIGH TAX IMPACTS BEFORE TRANSFERRING TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI

<TEXT>
<P>
Q: What would the consequences be on state, federal and local property taxes if 
I were to transfer title to my home to my son now? -- P. S. 
</P>
<P>
A: Let's start with income taxes, both state and federal. According to our 
experts, your income tax obligations would not be affected by such a move. 
Neither would your son's -- at this point. However, when he sells the house, 
his tax basis in the house is your original basis -- so his tax liability could 
be considerable, depending on the amount your house has appreciated over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Local property taxes also pose no problem to you, now or later. In California, 
gifts of property between parent and child do not trigger a reassessment of the 
property as an outright sale would. 
</P>
<P>
However, before you think you're home free here, there are other issues you did 
not raise which could affect your evaluation of the pending deal. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the transfer will have gift-tax implications. You are allowed to 
make gifts totaling $600,000 over your lifetime or upon your death without 
paying gift tax to the federal government. If the value of your house exceeds 
that amount, you would owe gift taxes immediately on the amount above $600,000. 
But even if your house is worth less than $600,000, the value of your house is 
deducted from your lifetime limit, possibly triggering a gift tax assessment 
later when you make another gift, or estate tax upon your death. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, you did not mention whether you intend to continue living in the house 
after giving it to your son. Beware, if you do. The IRS has been known to argue 
that such arrangements are improper attempts to circumvent estate taxes and may 
attempt to include the house -- despite the earlier gift -- in your estate. In 
this case, the IRS would value the house as of your date of death and use that 
value to compute any estate tax. Meanwhile, of course, your earlier gift of the 
house would have exhausted at least a portion of your $600,000 exemption, 
leaving you caught in a double tax whammy. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you don't live in the house after giving it to your son, you should 
know that your son may well be better served receiving your assets after your 
death, rather than before. Why? When you give assets away, their value for tax 
purposes is their original value to you, not what they are worth on the date 
you give them away. However, the same items, if bequeathed at death, are valued 
as of the donor's date of death. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say your tax basis in your house is $50,000 and it is worth $400,000 when 
you give it to your son. If he sells it immediately, he will owe taxes on about 
$350,000 of profit, roughly speaking. However, if you left the same house to 
him in your will and he sold it for $400,000, he would have no tax liability 
since its tax basis would have been what he sold it for. 
</P>
<P>
IRAs Can Be Known by Different Names 
</P>
<P>
Q: In 1983 I opened an Individual Retirement Account by purchasing a 
certificate of deposit at a local bank. When the certificate matured, I 
withdrew the funds and transferred them to a thrift that offered a higher 
interest rate. The S&amp;L insisted that my new IRA be listed as "contributory" 
and not a "rollover." However, I am not eligible to make contributions to IRAs 
this year, and furthermore, the new account is really a transfer. Did the 
S&amp;L make a mistake? Do I need to do something fast to fix this? -- A. C. C. 
</P>
<P>
A: Relax. What you have is a mix-up with your S&amp;L over the use of the words 
"contributory" and "rollover." And both of you, to an extent, are correct. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the situation: When you opened your account in 1983, it was a 
contributory IRA, not a rollover of pension funds because you were the source 
of the funds. So, even now, about seven years later, your S&amp;L considers the 
account a contributory account. You, on the other hand, obviously consider the 
account a rollover since you transferred your funds from one institution to 
another when your certificate of deposit expired. It may be a rollover now, but 
the account originated with your contribution, so technically it is now a 
rollover of a contributory account. 
</P>
<P>
These semantic differences should make no difference to anyone, and the 
accounts should be treated identically, with one exception: You may never 
transfer this IRA, which originated as a contributory account, into a pension 
plan, as you could if it had originated as a pension rollover. These funds were 
never a part of a pension fund and must be kept separate from pension accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving State Affects Interest Income Taxes 
</P>
<P>
Q: I will soon move from California. Although I won't have earned income from 
state sources, I will get about $30,000 a year in interest from a note secured 
by California real estate. Must I pay California state taxes on this income? 
Also, when the note is repaid entirely in 1993, will I owe taxes to the state 
on my gain from the property sale? -- H. A. T. 
</P>
<P>
A: Our advisers say your interest income, much like stock dividends and other 
unearned income, is considered personal property and is not subject to 
California taxation once you move out of the state. However, you will owe state 
tax when the loan balance is repaid in 1993 because the note is secured by 
California real estate.

DISNEY CHANNEL'S SUCCESS BUCKS THE TREND IN PAY TELEVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a tough year for pay television, the Disney Channel has managed to swim 
against the tide. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-year-old pay TV channel will add at least another 665,000 subscribers 
this year -- more than all other pay services combined. And at only 12% 
penetration of pay TV homes, there is still lots of room for growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody says the pay TV business is a mature business, but I don't see it," 
says John Cooke, the buttoned-down president of the Disney Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other pay TV channels, which build their program schedule around movies, 
TDC seeks a broader audience by targeting specific viewers at different times 
of day: preschool kids in the morning, preteens in the late afternoon, family 
in the early evening and adults after 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody else in pay appeals to all segments of the household," explains Cooke, 
who notes that 25% of the channels subscribers have no children at all. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to popular belief, the Disney library contributes only about 
one-quarter of the channel's programming. The rest is originally produced or 
bought from outside producers. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not all Mary Poppins and Old Yeller, either, insists Cooke, who says 
the channel has lately increased showing movies with more "in depth" themes 
such as racism and prejudice in addition to concerts featuring pop musicians 
such as Billy Joel, Carole King and the Bee Gees. 
</P>
<P>
But Cooke also assures family viewers that they don't have to worry about 
turning to Disney and suffering through "an embarrassing moment." 
</P>
<P>
A major reason for Disney's subscriber growth is a relentless marketing 
campaign that plays up the Disney name and allows viewers repeated free 
sampling of the channel. At least five times a year TDC unscrambles its signal 
for preview periods of up to eight days. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our new subscribers have seen one or two prior previews," Cooke says. 
Most significant, 65% of new subscribers are signed up after one of the 
periodic samplings. This means that subscribers are familiar with the channel 
and less likely to drop it after subscribing. Known as "churn," disconnects are 
one of the biggest headaches in pay TV. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the lowest churn in the industry," Cooke boasts. 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether the Disney Channel can continue to buck the trend in 
pay TV. Cooke thinks so and doesn't foresee a slowdown, even in a recession. 
Part of the reason is that TDC's wholesale rate to local cable systems is about 
$3.50 per subscriber and the company has been willing to knock down that price 
to spur retail sales. JOHN LIPPMAN

S&amp;L FIASCO OPENS WAY FOR NEW BANKING ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MAYER, MARTIN MAYER is author of The Greatest Ever Bank Robbery: The 
Collapse of the Savings and Loan Industry. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the inner counsels of the White House for the last month, everybody has been 
worrying about a slowdown of bank lending that could exacerbate the economic 
slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush had chief executives of several big banks in for a pep talk 
breakfast. Regulators were chewed out by White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu and Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher for telling New England and 
Texas banks that they'd better write down the values of loans made to builders 
of offices and shopping centers nobody wants to rent. Treasury Secretary 
Nicholas F. Brady told first a bankers' group and then a securities industry 
convention that the time had come for examiners to lighten up a little. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the Fed made what was blatantly described as a gift of $600 million 
from taxpayers to banks by cutting the non-earning reserves banks had been 
required to keep at the Fed overnight. But the Fed's calculations, 
interestingly, implied that banks would use these new funds not to make loans 
but to buy Treasury bills. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, none of this is likely to persuade the banks to loosen the purse 
strings. For the regulators and examiners no longer control the evaluation of 
questionable assets in banks' portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
This loss of authority stems largely from the savings and loan fiasco. If a 
bank has stockholders, its annual statement must be audited by certified public 
accountants, and given the lawsuits filed against these supposed professionals 
after the collapse of the S&amp;Ls, they want to prove out the financials for 
themselves, whatever examiners say. 
</P>
<P>
Even more important, however, is the new demand on the banks for "capital" to 
back the loans they make. Before the arrival of deposit insurance in the 1930s, 
American banks had always run their business on a basis that about $10 of every 
$100 they lent was their owners' money -- their "capital ratio" was about 10%. 
The safety net the government put under banks allowed them to raise from the 
public a much higher proportion of money they lent, and by the mid-1980s the 
average large American bank had no more than $3 of its owners' money in every 
$100 it lent. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson of the S&amp;Ls was that when owners of such institutions don't have 
enough of their own money backing up loans, they make risky or even dishonest 
loans. The economists' word is "moral hazard." 
</P>
<P>
So the world's bank regulators agreed in the late 1980s to set higher "capital 
standards" for their banks. The first phase of this new worldwide regulation 
kicks in with the dawn of the coming new year. 
</P>
<P>
Now, banks that wish to grow -- and even, in many instances, to stay the same 
size -- will have to issue new shares of stock or new bonds to beef up their 
capital ratio. And the people who are asked to buy those stocks and bonds look 
at the banks a little differently from the people who are merely asked to lend 
banks money in the form of insured deposits or other bank borrowings protected 
by the government safety net. 
</P>
<P>
Investors look at banks to see whether their assets really are worth what the 
books say they are. Any losses on the assets, after all, must be paid for by 
reductions in capital. If regulators have been letting banks kid themselves by 
overstating the value of their assets, investors will force down prices of bank 
stocks and force up interest rates that banks must pay for borrowings the 
government doesn't protect. 
</P>
<P>
And that's what's happened. Big banks carry on their books their Brazilian 
loans at 80 cents on the dollar, even though the market trades such paper at 
less than 30 cents -- if they can find a buyer at all. Banks continue to value 
at 100 cents on the dollar loans they made to leveraged buyouts and mergers, 
even though corporations that borrowed the money are collapsing under the debt 
burden. Salomon Bros. reports that some banks are swapping these two kinds of 
loans: You take over my loan to Federated Department Stores, I'll take your 
loan to Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, banks didn't write down real estate loans even when cash flow 
from rentals clearly wouldn't be enough to service the loan and the appraised 
value of the building had fallen below the money the bank had put out to pay 
for its construction. In situations where the original loan had carried an 
"interest reserve" the bank could use to pay itself before the structure was 
rented, bankers -- like Sununu and Mosbacher -- insisted that the loan was 
still "performing" and could not be downgraded by an examiner. 
</P>
<P>
But the market doesn't care what the examiner thinks or does; the market knows 
there are lots of losses in this stuff. And there are. 
</P>
<P>
What the market is saying is that there are too many banks and too much money 
in the banking system. If there are too many banks, it's folly to expect 
investors to put in more capital. 
</P>
<P>
For the banks, the way out is to sell assets. If the rules require you to have 
$80 million in capital for a $1-billion bank and all you have is $72 million in 
capital, well, you can sell enough assets to bring you down to $900 million in 
assets. Because you don't want to show a loss on these sales (which would run 
down your capital), you sell off the best stuff. 
</P>
<P>
All the big banks sell off their credit card and automobile and home-equity 
loan receivables to get the assets off the balance sheet. They're also looking 
at their best loans to big companies, trying to figure out who would want to 
buy them. They're also shedding property. In the past couple of weeks, for 
example, we have seen Chase Manhattan sell its offices in Frankfurt, Germany, 
and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
And while they're selling what they've got, of course, there's no way the banks 
will be eagerly receptive to ideas for new loans -- whatever the White House 
says. 
</P>
<P>
By no means is all this contraction in lending bad news. Unwise fiscal policies 
and rather loose monetary policies after 1982 had given us an asset inflation 
in some ways as painful as the price inflation that so troubled us at the 
beginning of the last decade. The deals that are not getting done on Wall 
Street are deals that shouldn't be done anyway, and the shopping centers that 
are not being built would not be occupied if they were built. 
</P>
<P>
But asset disinflation can easily bleed over into debt deflation, which is the 
technical name for what happened in the Great Depression. If the banks weaken 
further in the spring, as the Fed expects, the remedy of choice appears to be 
the government purchase of new issues of preferred stock to be issued by banks 
having trouble raising money. The intermediary might be the Fed itself, or a 
new institution not unlike the Reconstruction Finance Corp. of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
No one can quarrel with the argument that at times -- and 1991 may be one of 
those times -- the government must intervene to make the banking system at 
least look healthy. But we must know what we're doing. We can't and shouldn't 
go back to banking as it was in the 1980s, with its desperate struggle to grow 
on the back of risky loans. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to what often gets said in Washington and New York, our 
entrepreneurial society does not need giant banks doing all sorts of business 
all over the country. The giant borrowers who used to patronize and support 
giant banks no longer need bank loans; they borrow directly from the lenders 
who used to lend through the banks. 
</P>
<P>
The country needs profitable, smaller banks with roots in their local and 
regional economies to take care of borrowers who rely on their services. The 
task for regulators is to help large banks shrink without draining away the 
credit that is heart's blood to the economy.

ERMA BOMBECK: LET ROSEANNE BE NO BARR TO PEACE

<P>
I haven't heard too many solutions for the problems in the deserts of the 
Mideast. Oh, there was that bad joke about how President Bush was going to send 
1,000 women with PMS because they were not only mean as snakes but they also 
could retain water. But other than that, no one has come forward with a plan. 
Until a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
An Italian politician and porn star, Illona Staller (a.k.a. La Cicciolina), has 
volunteered to sleep with Saddam Hussein if he agrees to free the foreigners he 
is holding in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
I feel like a fool. The only thing I could come up with was to cut down on my 
gas consumption by car-pooling. 
</P>
<P>
The radical member of Parliament's offer is a dramatic one, but I have to ask 
myself: Where was Illona when we were dealing with the old Ayatollah Khomeini 
or the Zits Squad -- Gen. Manuel Noriega, Moammar Kadafi and Yasser Arafat? If 
this is to be a viable solution to our global problems, we can't pick and 
choose whom to sleep with. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I was surprised to see this offer come from Italy. It's usually the 
French who make love, not war. The English, on the other hand, would have 
countered with, "Let's sit down over a nice cup of hot tea." The Italians 
traditionally would have said, "Relax. I'll make you a nice dinner." 
</P>
<P>
The Americans? We don't really make sacrifices until we are pushed into a 
corner. But we can do it. We can bite the bullet if we have to. There's an 
entire generation out there without any idea of what we did to win World War II 
on the home front. For four years, my grandmother saved her fat in large coffee 
cans. I don't know what she ever did with it, but someone told her to do it and 
she did. Nylon was being used for parachutes, so women used makeup on their 
legs and painted a seam up the back with a pencil. On a hot day, the makeup 
melted and your legs looked like someone turned up the heat in a wax museum. 
</P>
<P>
We had ration stamps for sugar, coffee, shoes and gasoline. I don't recall 
anyone stepping forward and volunteering to sleep with Hitler or Tojo. 
</P>
<P>
On Thanksgiving, President Bush unveiled his secret weapon for peace. He said 
he considered sending Roseanne Barr to Iraq to sing "The Star-Spangled Banner." 
Before you discard that idea, remember what happened to Noriega when he hid out 
in the Vatican embassy and our soldiers played rock music at 140 decibels? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe our options come down to Illona or Roseanne.

Natural History Museum gala Thursday, says Craig Black, museum director. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose is to open "Gifts From the Great Land: Alaskan Artifacts From the 
National Museum of Finland," made possible by a $100,000 grant from Arco. It's 
open to the public Saturday through April 7. 
</P>
<P>
VALENTINO: A few Angelenos expect to be in Rome for Valentino Garavani's 
30-year retrospective opening March 7. The couturier looked svelte, but a 
little anxious, at the recent crush at the opening of his new Valentino 
Boutique at 250 N. Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
He was more relaxed at the celebratory dinner for 60 later at L'Orangerie. Some 
of the city's best-dressed ladies -- Betty Wilson, Betsy Bloomingdale 
(Garavani's dinner partner), Harriet Deutsch, Barbara Davis and Joanna Poitier 
-- hovered around him. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy and Leonard Goldberg revealed they expect to be in Rome for the 
retrospective, which later travels to Florence, Berlin, Paris, New York, then 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Valentino chairman Giancarlo Gianmetti sat next to Italian actress Ornella Muti 
(she's in Sylvester Stallone's new film, "Oscar") and photographed Michelle 
Phillips. Valentino vice president Luciano Villarini of New York called Los 
Angeles "the most important city in the United States today." Why? "The 
atmosphere, wealth, climate, the concept of homes with gardens." 
</P>
<P>
UPSMANSHIP: First, invites to the Diadames (ladies' gourmet society) "Salute 
the Renaissance of Italian Cuisine" came with silk gold tassels tied around 
Lorenza de Medici's book, "The Renaissance of Italian Cooking." 
</P>
<P>
Then Barbara Knight, Coco Viault, Margaret Spillane, Kay McKay and Diane 
Skouras moved elegantly ahead. The result was perfection with five-star cuisine 
-- angel hair pasta, pheasant consomme, lobster, grape sorbet, roast veal, 
baked fennel, chocolate parfait with chestnut sauce. Hanging grape clusters 
added luster. 
</P>
<P>
MOCA ON TOUR: In the holiday rush, 275 boarded buses and vans to see 
contemporary art at the homes of Leonore and Bernard Greenberg, Lynda and 
Stewart Resnick, Marcia and Richard Schulman and Annette and Leonard Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
It was MOCA on Tour, and $40,000 was raised by the Projects Council. Later, 
over lunch at the Beverly Hills Hotel, participants viewed Fred Hayman's 
fashions. Involved: Mandy Einstein, Darleen Norris, Aviva Covitz, Joan and Fred 
Nicholas, Donnie Smith, Pearl and Joan Bornstein, Bea and Susan Gersh, Joan 
Burns, Peggy Phelps and Betye Burton. 
</P>
<P>
THE SPINSTERS: Newest members got a command bid for the Spinsters' annual 
black-tie Christmas Dansant at the Bel Age Hotel. They are Annie Baxter, Paige 
Bierly, Vicki Cunningham, Shelly Dickerson, Susan Facey, Carol Faris, Debbie 
Gauthier, Cynthia Janes, Carolyn Johnson, Carol Lewis, Mary Massie, Tina Niblo, 
Pam Nickerson, Cheryl Parnell, Birgit Reisch, Barbie Schnieders, Carolyn Spears 
and Cindy Varga. 
</P>
<P>
VITALITY: There was Dinah Shore, making Tecate bread and thin brownies at the 
Beach Club for 100 members of Children's Chain of Childrens Hospital. Much to 
the delight of Cheryl Baker, Raylene Meyer, Brooke Young and Louise Korshak, 
she also donated 200 of her new cookbooks, "The Day With Dinah" for charity. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: Too many friends had been crime victims, so Jenny Jones told the CHIPS 
(Colleagues Helpers in Philanthropic Service) and their spouses to come casual 
to the Beach Club and learn about self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
After sandwiches and pasta, well-padded "bad guys" were lined up, and the 
audience experienced mock encounters. After it was all over, a group including 
Debbie and Terry Lanni, John and Cynthia Hall and Susy Niven looked a little 
rumpled. 
</P>
<P>
CO-ED: As they have since 1923, students at Boys Republic in Chino are 
assembling for sale those aromatic Della Robbia Christmas wreaths from sacks of 
pine cones, 
</P>
<P>
greenery and barrels of fresh apples. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, a 17-year-old girl, the first placement at Girls Republic, 
a satellite residential treatment center recently developed in Monrovia, 
stepped up to make the assembly line co-ed. 
</P>
<P>
PAST PERFECT: On their first benefit, at the Regent Beverly Wilshire, the 
Associates for Breast Cancer Studies (the ABCs) are boasting 530 guests and a 
$120,000 net. Buddy Rogers was honored as "Mr. Hollywood" and responded by 
playing "When the Saints Come Marching In" on his trombone. Fred and Suzi Wehba 
underwrote the benefit and received the "Spirit of Hope" award. Monty Hall, 
Ruta Lee and Norm Crosby and the Fifth Dimension created more magic for the 
minds of chairman Martin Roth and helpers Hal and Cynthia Gershman and Jack 
Lerman . . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Bistro Garden was sparkling with Christmas spirit for Les Amies' party for 
Children's Institute International. Margo Hirsh, Rita Cruikshank and Ruth 
Clayburgh get the lion's share of credit . . . . 
</P>
<P>
More than 450 came in good cheer for the "Voices of Christmas" soiree, raising 
more than $80,000 for Saint John's Hospital and Health Center's Heart 
Institute. Joining the Anita Kerr Singers and Les Brown and His Band of Renown 
at the Regent Beverly Wilshire were Rosemarie Stack, Howard Keel, John and 
Rosemary Raitt, Nadine Watt and Father Maurice Chase.

ROGER SIMON: THE CONTRACT WITH UNCLE SAM HAS AN ASTERISK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Enlisting in the "peacetime" Army has to lead the list of things that seemed 
like a good idea at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials would come on late at night when consumer resistance was low. 
The ads for the "Army! Navy! Air Force! Marines!" emphasized the useful skills 
you could obtain, the leadership qualities that would impress future employers 
and the camaraderie and fun you could find in the military. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere was the likelihood of real combat or actual death mentioned. But heck, 
I'll bet those "ring-around-the-collar" commercials weren't a hundred percent 
accurate either. 
</P>
<P>
Now, volunteers in the U.S. armed services not only face actual combat in the 
Mideast, but they can't even go home when their enlistment is up. 
</P>
<P>
Didn't read the fine print, did they? Nope, they are stuck in service to their 
country for the duration. Not that America won't be grateful to them when they 
come back: 
</P>
<P>
Employer: "You got any skills?" 
</P>
<P>
Combat Veteran: "I can defuse a poison gas canister and field-strip a 
howitzer." 
</P>
<P>
Employer: "Well, normally we'd start you on the hamburgers, but I guess you can 
move right up to the fries." 
</P>
<P>
As has been pointed out numerous times, our peacetime Army is not 
representative of the nation as a whole. It is disproportionately poor and 
under-educated. 
</P>
<P>
A few centuries ago, this would have been taken as normal, even desirable. Wars 
were seen as a way of "cleansing" societies of undesirable elements. Today, we 
don't see it that way. Though a nice, drawn-out war would boost our economy. 
</P>
<P>
There have already been a few stories: Gas-mask and bottled-water companies are 
doing fine. And high gas prices are helping the economies in states like Texas 
and Oklahoma. As we all know, the Great Depression of the 1930s was not really 
ended by anything Franklin Roosevelt did; it was ended by World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Not that we can expect the same economic benefits from a Gulf war. It will be 
too short. Our President promises us this. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush's optimistic assessment of the length of a Gulf war is based in 
part on geography and in part on Saddam Hussein's inability to get replacement 
parts (assuming he does not already have them in stockpiles that we do not know 
about) and the assumption that all of America's wonderful technological toys 
will work. 
</P>
<P>
They won't, of course. 
</P>
<P>
In World War II, many American torpedoes simply bounced off Japanese ships. In 
Vietnam, rifles jammed. Today, when the toys have become even more complicated, 
it could be anything. 
</P>
<P>
But don't worry about the hardware. That is not our whole secret to victory. We 
have an ace in the hole: the American fighting man. 
</P>
<P>
The image of the American GI as superman -- even after somewhat mixed reviews 
from Grenada and Panama -- is persistent. I found it this week in an essay in a 
newsmagazine by an ex-Vietnam War correspondent, who wrote: "An army trained to 
take on the Soviet superpower should be able to beat -- and beat quickly -- a 
Third World force." 
</P>
<P>
Right. You bet. Those Iraqis are just a bunch of towel-heads, just like the 
North Vietnamese were just a bunch of monkeys in black pajamas. And our boys -- 
trained to beat those big, strapping Russkies -- will make mincemeat out of 
them. Yeah. Count on it. 
</P>
<P>
Except that the Iraqis have the single most valuable combat tool: experience. 
You can say the eight-year Iran-Iraq war was fought by two stumble-bum armies, 
but there is no replacement for actual combat. Our men have had only training. 
The Iraqis have fought a modern war and survived. 
</P>
<P>
But there is only one way to really find out who has the better army: war. And 
this is what George Bush is tilting for. 
</P>
<P>
In August, when he imposed sanctions on Iraq, he did not say four or five 
months was the limit of his patience. In August, he did not say sanctions had 
to work quickly or they would be abandoned. But he is saying that now. 
</P>
<P>
He is saying it for a number of reasons, but the most important one is the need 
for Bush to wrest the initiative away from Saddam Hussein. So far, Saddam has 
been calling the shots. He invades. He lets hostages go one week. He makes 
threats the next week. 
</P>
<P>
And our President must sit in the Oval Office and listen. Just like Jimmy 
Carter sat in the Oval Office and had to listen to the Ayatollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for sanctions to work makes George Bush feel passive and weak. And he 
will not tolerate that. He wants to seize the initiative even if he has to 
launch a war to do it. 
</P>
<P>
And, from his point of view, war must come relatively quickly if it is to come 
at all. By the end of next year, Bush must start actively campaigning for 
re-election. And he must have a resolution of this crisis by then. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush has been in a war and has seen actual combat. So it is not possible 
for him to like war. 
</P>
<P>
But it is possible for him to need one.

ALICE KAHN: WHEN DID THEY MAKE THE BIG ELF A SAINT?

<P>
What awaits the weary shepherd following yonder fake star to the mall at 
Christmas? Relentless assaults by professional perfume sample squirters, 
guilt-tripping harangues by shrieking merchandise protesters and, now, the 
worst of all -- behavioral inquisitions from Santa Claus! 
</P>
<P>
I did not witness the incident myself. A friend took my daughter to the mall. 
That is because I am among the walking sane who avoid malls this time of year. 
I will go for city sidewalks, busy sidewalks or small neighborhood shops. But 
those walled cities of the damned bring out the caged rat in me. 
</P>
<P>
One pass through the brightly lit maze of Mrs. Fields', Calico Corners, 
Express, The Limited, Yogurt Delite, Tops 'n Bottoms, Big 'n Tall, Pretty 'n 
Plump, Closets 'n Things -- 'n I gotta bolt. 
</P>
<P>
This will probably be the last time my 11-year-old daughter sits on Santa's 
knee. By next year, the hormonal storm that's a comin' will no doubt take her 
away. So I asked her for a report on how it went. 
</P>
<P>
I expected to hear that when she sat down and he asked, "What do you want?" she 
handed him the same list of demands she brought to my holiday bargaining table. 
It reads like a litany of transitional dreams: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- A stereo with two tape places, a radio, two speakers, in a black, white, 
blue, gray or red color. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Stuffed animals. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Hair things. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- A phone in my room or my own line or get call waiting. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- A wallet. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- MONEY! 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- A water bed. 
</P>
<P>
9 -- A new coat. 
</P>
<P>
10 -- More tapes. 
</P>
<P>
11 -- Candy -- an old-fashioned gumball machine. 
</P>
<P>
12 -- More dresses. 
</P>
<P>
13 -- Puffy Paints. 
</P>
<P>
14 -- Football. 
</P>
<P>
15 -- Soccerball. 
</P>
<P>
16 -- Socks. 
</P>
<P>
17 -- Headphones for my Walkman. 
</P>
<P>
18 -- Big stress guy. 
</P>
<P>
The last item was my favorite. It's a Silly Putty-like figure that you can 
squish and squeeze, sold under the name Executive Stress Buster. She already 
has a little one on her key chain, but no doubt the demands of the approaching 
12th birthday will require the stress guy in extra-Large. 
</P>
<P>
Just being a kid these days is stressful enough. And don't look to Santa Claus 
for a break. 
</P>
<P>
"So, did Santa ask you if you'd been a good little girl?" I asked her. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that Santa has gotten more specific in these troubled times. "He 
asked me something else," she said. "He asked, 'What will you say when someone 
offers you drugs?' " 
</P>
<P>
She said he asked a lot of other questions. She was well coached and knew all 
the right answers. 
</P>
<P>
But I began to worry that instead of candy canes he was passing out condoms. 
</P>
<P>
I am certainly not opposed to drug education or sex education or even 
sensitivity training. There probably are children for whom Santa is the only 
credible adult authority figure left. But I wonder if we can't let up for one 
minute and have a Santa who is just a low-key, fun kinda guy. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I won't protest or sue or stage a write-in campaign against a 
sanctimonious Santa, but you can bet some crusading mother-for-the-'90s will. 
And then, you know what will happen? We'll have to fill out permission forms to 
allow our child to sit on Santa's knee. 
</P>
<P>
Someday, some kid will be standing with a friend's mom at the mall, screaming 
and crying outside Santaland while the mall manager says, "I'm sorry, but we 
can't proceed unless we have the paperwork on this child." 
</P>
<P>
So, Santa. Let's just keep it simple. Can you say: "Been a good little boy or 
girl? . . . Whatdaya want? . . . Here's a candy cane -- what's your hurry?" 
</P>
<P>
The last thing the mall needs is a Santa Claus who's acting like some kind of 
saint.

ARTIST BUILDS A BETTER WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: WITH THE HELP OF SCIENCE, TOM VAN SANT CREATES A REMARKABLY 
DETAILED IMAGE OF THE EARTH AS IT APPEARS FROM SPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The globe on your bookshelf was never like the GeoSphere. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of man-imposed borders and artificially colored countries, there's a 
picture-perfect, remarkably detailed, cloudless image of the Earth's land 
masses and oceans, pretty much as they appear from space. 
</P>
<P>
As the globe rotates, light from an artificial sun throws some continents into 
shadows or "night," and then tiny optic fibers wink on to mark the light show 
of the world's major cities after dark. 
</P>
<P>
The image is a complex mosaic, created over the last year and a half, of 
thousands of satellite photos pieced together by a team of artists, computer 
experts and scientists under the direction of Santa Monica artist Tom Van Sant. 
He financed the project first with a $30,000 grant from the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, then by using the proceeds from the sale 
of his Los Feliz home, then by stretching his credit to the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
Computer-graphics experts from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena joined 
Van Sant's team, mostly in their spare time, to create the technology that made 
the image possible. Before they were finished, they had not only invented 
methods for Van Sant to correct color distortions in satellite pictures but 
also devised a program that permitted Van Sant to see through the clouds that 
perpetually blanket parts of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The "globe" the team produced could revolutionize the globe industry when it 
enters the market, as early as next year, says Jon Hultman, an executive with 
Replogle Globes Inc., an Illinois-based firm and major globe manufacturer. 
Hultman is negotiating distribution rights to Van Sant's creation, which may be 
the biggest thing in globes since the 1950s, when bumps were placed on them to 
symbolize mountain chains. 
</P>
<P>
For Van Sant, the project is more than the realization of an artistic dream. 
It's a necessity, he says, a potential cure for mankind's predilection for 
failing to treat the Earth as a fragile, organism-like entity. 
</P>
<P>
"The Earth is like a person," he says. "You might not appreciate how much you 
would be affected if something happened to a small part of you, like your big 
toe. But everything is connected, interrelated." An untreated infection in one 
small place could imperil the entire organism, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant says the GeoSphere can make this point forcefully. GeoSphere 
technology can go beyond creating what its makers call a "reality image" of the 
Earth. The technology has the potential to generate computer pictures of the 
Earth, past and future. 
</P>
<P>
Such projections already exist in the form of tables and charts, the dialect of 
scientists. The purpose of a three-dimensional globe is to translate scientific 
data into a picture that can be understood by policy-makers and ordinary 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"If the World Bank is deciding whether to support dam building or a 
deforestation project in the Amazon, they are not now able to see all the 
ramifications of this decision," Van Sant says. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, GeoSphere technology will be able to project "what the Amazon 
region looked like in 1972, 1982, and show what it looks like in 1990," Van 
Sant says. "With risk projection, we can show what the rain forests will look 
like in 2010 given the same rate of deforestation." 
</P>
<P>
"Earth-resource studies and Earth sciences are no longer territory for 
scientific inquiry alone," he says. "They are essential ingredients in the 
formation of public policy." 
</P>
<P>
It makes perfect sense for an artist to be heading a scientific project with 
that goal, Van Sant says. "Artists are tremendously needed in the world of 
technology to be able to take these issues and communicate them effectively." 
Besides, he says, "I'm comfortable with large things." 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant has crossed between art and science before. In 1980, he placed 
sunlight-reflecting mirrors in the Mojave Desert to overexpose picture panels 
in a satellite passing overhead. The overexposure created what appeared to be a 
drawing of a giant eye, about 2.5 kilometers across, or 100,000 times the size 
of a human eye. 
</P>
<P>
And, he's used a stream of electrons to etch a microscopic eye, 100,000 times 
smaller than normal, into the side of a salt crystal. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant, 59, has also produced more traditional art -- paintings, murals and 
sculptures -- all across Southern California. The former Marine and Korean War 
veteran has supported himself as an artist since earning a master's degree in 
fine arts in 1957 from the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant has accepted virtually no commissions, however, since March, 1989, 
when an eye infection after a cornea transplant nearly blinded him. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that could save my eyes was the administration of five 
different antibiotics in my eyes every half-hour for 10 days," he recalls. 
"That's a treatment that made everyone crazy, even the nurses. I emptied my 
mind of all thought and resided there for 10 days. When that period was over, 
the GeoSphere made a choice on me. Nothing else would reside in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
But single-mindedness was no substitute for technical expertise. That's why Van 
Sant called JPL's Van Warren, who had put together a cruder computer-assisted 
Earth mosaic on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wanted to see the Earth as it looked from space," Warren says. "We 
pay so much attention to other planets, why not pay attention to our own 
planet? It is what affects us most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
JPL agreed to release Warren for four months to work with Van Sant, who used 
his own money to purchase a $200,000 advanced graphics computer. Overall, the 
artist, who lives in a Santa Monica garage apartment with his 8-year-old son, 
estimates that he's invested about $350,000 in the project. 
</P>
<P>
For months, the GeoSphere team labored in a dark, creaky, converted garage in 
Pasadena. Between them, Van Sant and Warren painstakingly pored over about five 
years of satellite data and aerial photography bought or borrowed from 
government storage facilities. The goal was to find at least one cloud-free 
satellite picture of every section of land and water. From these, Van Sant 
could use Warren's computer program to assemble a single mosaic-style picture 
of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Some areas, such as parts of the Amazon, the Congo and southern New Zealand, 
were always covered with clouds. Enter JPL's Jim Knighton, who had purchased 
charts and tables, originally compiled by the CIA, describing various rivers 
and coastlines. Even before he met Van Sant, Knighton, who has now become the 
project's technical director, had been using computer graphics to convert these 
data into picture form. 
</P>
<P>
The image remained seriously flawed, however, because the colors -- coded by 
scientists concerned with such topics as surface temperature and infrared 
radiation -- were wrong. Heavily forested areas, for instance, typically came 
out red instead of green. Van Sant says they looked like raw meat. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Blume, another computer-graphics consultant who then worked for JPL, 
designed a program to correct the colors. 
</P>
<P>
At every turn, Van Sant could move forward with the mosaic only after his 
technical team created a computer medium within which he could work. It was as 
if da Vinci had to keep the "Mona Lisa" on hold while his colleagues struggled 
to invent the paintbrush. 
</P>
<P>
The image that emerged is not quite a photo, though it looks like one. Surface 
features in perpetually cloud-covered areas were traced in through computer 
graphics and colored as they would appear. Green areas were made a little 
greener, to compensate for natural factors that convert green to a dull brown 
when viewed from space. Other surface features, such as rivers, were enhanced 
to make them more visible. 
</P>
<P>
The team says its computer image, finished in April, is one of the largest and 
most complex ever assembled. It contains well over 37 million pixels. Each 
pixel is an individually controlled dot of color that makes up part of the 
image. And every pixel had about 15 sets of data behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of its sheer enormity," Warren says, "I did feel at times like a 
bricklayer." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution enables Van Sant to show any object on the surface that's four 
kilometers -- about 4,400 yards -- or larger, although a person might need a 
powerful magnifying glass to see it. Next, Van Sant would like to try for a 
one-kilometer resolution, which would require four times the amount of 
information and render objects as small as airports distinguishable. 
</P>
<P>
In Van Sant's computer, the Earth appears on a monitor and will turn or rotate 
on command. The computer program can zoom in on any designated geographic 
location, such as the Nile River. Van Sant eventually hopes JPL's Knighton can 
package this software for home computers. 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant says an inexpensive home globe for families and classrooms is also 
just around the corner. Ideally, that globe would include a variety of snap-on 
accessories, to show political boundaries, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Van Sant has lined up vendors to sell poster versions of his 
GeoSphere image. Just in time, Van Sant says, noting he's come near the end of 
his savings and credit. "The universe is looking after us," he said.

ROAD IN HILLS LEADS RIGHT INTO COURT; 
</P>
<P>
MONROVIA: TWO LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED OVER PERMISSION -- OR LACK OF IT -- TO 
BUILD THE PATHWAY ACROSS PRIVATE PROPERTY.

<TEXT>
<P>
A developer and a property owner are fighting in court over who gave permission 
-- and who should pay -- for a road that cut a slash across the Monrovia 
foothills. 
</P>
<P>
The couple who own the hillside property say in their suit that the road, 
almost a mile long, was cut through their land without authorization. The 
developer, meanwhile, has sued Monrovia, claiming that city officials approved 
plans for the road without obtaining the owners' permission. 
</P>
<P>
Former Diamond Bar City Councilman Gary G. Miller and his wife, Cathleen, filed 
a $10.5-million lawsuit against Arcadia developer Charles Bluth on Aug. 30, 
alleging that Bluth trespassed on their property to cut the road, and destroyed 
250 oak trees and other vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 21, Bluth sued the city, seeking $5 million in damages for loss of 
income for the delay in adding 24 single-family houses to his 24-home 
Whispering Pines Estates. Bluth's suit accuses the city of negligence for 
approving construction of the road without obtaining the property owners' 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
Bluth says Monrovia officials gave him permission last year to build an access 
road to the city's water tank in order to provide water to the Whispering Pines 
extension. The city also planned to use the road as emergency fire access, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bluth's lawsuit, the city had planned to have the road built, and 
was preparing to put the project up for bid. The suit says that, to avoid delay 
in constructing the homes, the city allowed Bluth to build the road and 
approved his plans for the project. He said city officials told him that they 
would obtain permission for an easement and water line. Bluth said the city 
later revised his plans, and gave him new plans that included installing fire 
hydrants along the water line. 
</P>
<P>
Between Dec. 26, 1989, and Jan. 11, while the road was under construction, city 
inspectors and other employees viewed the work and allowed it to continue, 
Bluth's suit says. 
</P>
<P>
Don Hopper, Monrovia's community development director, said the city's 
November, 1988, approval of a water line from Upper Cloverleaf Reservoir to 
Bluth's housing development was only conceptual. Bluth began grading before 
final plans were presented to the City Council, Hopper said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a city report, the council was unaware that the city intended to 
grade a maintenance road in addition to the water line.

PARKING BAN SURVEY MAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Questionnaires about the city's ban on overnight parking have been mailed to 
6,000 randomly selected Pasadena households. 
</P>
<P>
City Directors are re-evaluating the 35-year-old ordinance that prohibits 
parking on city streets between 2 and 6 a.m. The re-evaluation began after the 
city stepped up enforcement in July to aid street-sweeping operations and some 
recipients of $20 tickets complained. 
</P>
<P>
The questionnaires must be returned by Dec. 17. The board will discuss the 
ordinance in February.

SMITH STUDIES REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Donna Smith, who last month said she plans to seek a third term, now says 
she is reevaluating whether to run again. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's son Sean, an 18-year-old Army private, suffered severe burns Nov. 8 
while lighting a stove at a training base in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she has been so preoccupied by her son's injuries that she hasn't 
had time to think through her own plans. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has more than two weeks in which to make up her mind. Candidates for 
mayor and four City Council seats must file papers by Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon Thursday, 10 candidates had taken out nominating papers for 
the March 5 municipal election, including Councilman Tomas Ursua, who is 
running for mayor, and Councilwoman Nell Soto, who announced that she will seek 
reelection in the 1st District.

<P>
Street corner Christmas tree lots have been springing up all over, and colored 
lights already twinkle merrily in just about every suburban cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
But admit it: It's not really the Christmas season until you've seen a Sugar 
Plum Fairy or two. 
</P>
<P>
To get the holiday's requisite Tchaikovsky fix, go to the San Gabriel Civic 
auditorium, where the Pasadena Dance Theatre is staging nine performances of 
the "The Nutcracker," beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The dance company's 10th annual production of the ballet features a return to 
the traditional. The dances will be based on the original full-length 
production of "The Nutcracker" created for the San Francisco Ballet in 1944 by 
choreographer William F. Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen, now 86, is supervising rehearsals of the Pasadena production. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Dance Theatre was founded in 1958 and is run by twin brothers 
Charles and Philip Fuller, both former dancers with the San Francisco Ballet. 
This year's "Nutcracker" will feature Leslie Carothers, former principal dancer 
of the Joffrey Ballet, as the Sugar Plum Fairy. 
</P>
<P>
The ballet opens Friday for performances Dec. 14 through 16 and 21 through 23 
at the San Gabriel Civic Auditorium, 320 S. Mission Dr., San Gabriel. Ticket 
prices range from $12 to $20. KAREN E. KLEIN

NEW COUNCIL MUST HEED VOTER MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As we usher in a new Santa Monica City Council, it is important to recognize 
the messages the voters sent this past election. 
</P>
<P>
We will no longer tolerate large-scale development that adversely affects our 
residential quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
The significant support garnered by the independent candidates, coupled with 
the passage of Propositions S and Z, amply attest to that. The council should 
now begin to intelligently manage commercial development to stay within our 
infrastructural capacities and to have it serve our neighborhoods. An essential 
component of such a strategy is immediate downzoning in certain areas and the 
implementation of plans to protect residential neighborhoods from the impacts 
of already-approved development. 
</P>
<P>
The voters also said that violent behavior by the homeless must stop, and 
solutions need to be developed to help them move back into society. I was 
heartened to see several council candidates adopt the position that, in 
exchange for meals and temporary shelter, able-bodied homeless provide public 
work, such as cleaning up our parks and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the voters said, as did I, that both rent control initiatives were 
unacceptable. The Rent Control Board should now move forward with the Incentive 
Housing Program that would provide landlords substantial rent relief, while at 
the same time assuring preservation of affordable housing through covenants to 
stay in business, enhanced tenant protections and a sensible "inclusionary" 
housing quotient.

SHEDDING LIGHT ON WETLANDS PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Milton Bassett's comments on the settlement between Friends of Ballona Wetlands 
and Maguire Thomas Partners, developer of Playa Vista (Times, Nov. 11), 
indicate that he doesn't understand the terms of our agreement. I hope I can 
shed some light on just what the Friends agreed to support and why. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, certain trigger words used by Bassett only serve to arouse 
emotions, while obscuring facts. When he labels the wetlands restoration a "pet 
project" of the Friends, he denigrates one of the most important ecological 
assets in Southern California. Over 90% of the wetlands are gone in Los Angeles 
County. Our battle was fought to save what is left. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the figures Bassett cites to support his contentions are misleading in 
that they speak of an "increase in density" over the original project. It's 
true there is an increase in residential units. But I would remind him that the 
original project contained a regional shopping center (a tremendous traffic 
generator), 33% more retail space, 25% more new office space and very little 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
The Maguire Thomas plan will increase affordable housing by 110%. Additionally, 
the amount of space devoted to recreational uses and open space will be 
significantly increased. A 60-acre parcel west of Lincoln Boulevard and south 
of Jefferson Boulevard protected by the new agreement had been targeted by 
Summa Corp. for 10- to 15-story buildings, 1,433 units of housing and a private 
golf course. Now that area will be freshwater ponds and a freshwater wetland. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas also agreed to eliminate an extension of Falmouth Avenue that 
would have sliced through the heart of the restored wetland. They also 
abandoned plans for a 225-unit building at the stable site adjacent to the most 
sensitive portion of the wetland and replaced it, at our insistence, with a 
plant nursery and other uses compatible with the wetland. 
</P>
<P>
Within Playa Vista, Maguire Thomas plans a recycling facility for refuse 
separation, a combined sludge and refuse organics processing facility to 
produce soil amendment, and an on-site water reclamation plant. The reclaimed 
water will be used for irrigation of landscaping, energy conservation, car 
washes, toilet flushing and habitat improvement in the wetlands and Ballona 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
When we added to all these pluses the realities of the marketplace, the Friends 
concluded the settlement was the very best they could achieve. It would be 
wonderful to have no development at all. It would also be wonderful to return 
to Eden. But we live in the real world. The settlement we made is the best 
possible in that world. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there are many issues besides the wetlands involved in Playa Vista, 
and, yes, the project will have substantial impact on the surrounding 
communities. But Playa Vista will have to go through public hearings. When the 
draft Environmental Impact Report is circulated, we -- and everyone else -- 
will have the opportunity to comment. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 14 years since Playa Vista was first announced by the Summa Corp. 
The Friends have fought every moment of those years to prevent the destruction 
of the Ballona Wetlands. We are pleased to have achieved our goal. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mr. Bassett, please try to think kindly of the Ballona Wetlands. 
They have had to live for many years with the "devastating environmental 
impact" of the surrounding communities. They have fought the longest, faced the 
most deprivation, surmounted insult and degradation and survived in the face of 
terrible adversity. Now it's our turn to nurse them back to health. When you 
see them in all their restored glory, you'll be glad we did.

NO HEAT, LITTLE WARMTH AT GALANTER FORUM; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE CAREFULLY ORCHESTRATED TOWN HALL MEETING ALLOWED THE COUNCILWOMAN 
TO KEEP THE PEACE IN THE DISCONTENTED COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a mighty silent night in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Though nearly 400 residents turned out for a town hall meeting with Los Angeles 
City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter Wednesday night, there was no debate, minimal 
dissent and none of the rip-roaring rhetoric for which the community is famous. 
</P>
<P>
The usually voluble Venetians, some of whom have been Galanter's harshest 
critics, sat quietly as the first-term councilwoman reviewed the state of the 
community as she saw it. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the last of a series held by Galanter in recent months around 
her 6th Council District as she prepares to run for reelection next spring. She 
and her staff bill the gatherings as a chance for her to hear from constituents 
or help them with their problems with the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's for the normal people. It's for the average person who doesn't get a 
chance to interact with their government very often," explained Galanter Press 
Deputy Rick Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
The Venice event was considered to be potentially troublesome for Galanter, who 
sometimes turns testy when confronted by pointed criticism. But if there is, as 
some critics say, a groundswell of discontent in Venice with Galanter, there 
was scant evidence at this gathering at Penmar Recreation Center. Neither, 
however, was there an outpouring of support. 
</P>
<P>
"Meetings in Venice are not generally very calm," Galanter marveled afterward. 
Usually, she said, "if you have two people in Venice, you have 28 opinions." 
</P>
<P>
But as some residents pointed out after the meeting, the only way to have a 
dialogue or express dissent was to cause a scene. The carefully controlled 
format allowed for no give-and-take. Only written questions were accepted and 
culled by the staff. Galanter chose which ones to answer and seemed to 
paraphrase rather than read them directly from the paper, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the 18 questions she answered during a 25-minute period were 
innocuous inquiries that enabled her to expound on what she has done for the 
district. "I support what the community wants," was a common theme. There was 
also discussion of trash cans for the beach, why city recycling has not come to 
Venice (it is scheduled to start next summer or fall) and when the Venice Pier 
might reopen (not yet determined). 
</P>
<P>
Before taking questions, Galanter gave an overview of major issues in her 
district. She started out with bread-and-butter issue of safety, praising 
Neighborhood Watch for saving her life when she was attacked in her home during 
her 1987 election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
She talked about changing the name West Washington Boulevard to Abbot Kinney 
Boulevard to honor the founder of Venice. She noted that the Venice Historical 
Society is doing well. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Galanter got around to the volatile development issue. She joked 
that any building of more than two units was sure to cause a controversy in 
Venice. No one laughed. She said she has succeeded in scaling down two of the 
largest projects in her district -- the recently approved Channel Gateway in 
Venice and the vast Playa Vista development, which is in the planning process. 
</P>
<P>
Cloaked in her incumbent mantle, Galanter is surrounded at these events by 
representatives of city departments, who are available for personal 
consultation on matters such as law enforcement, street lighting and 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
While the subject of the coming City Council elections was diligently avoided, 
politics was plainly in the air. As Galanter expounded on her achievements, one 
of her declared opponents, Mary Lee Gray, mingled with the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Gray, a field deputy for county Supervisor Deane Dana, 
distributed campaign brochures outside the door. 
</P>
<P>
A spot check of people at the meeting showed some who were trying to figure out 
what was going on in Venice and some who had particular problems they wanted 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Alessandra De Clario, for example, said she came because she was sick of 
drivers speeding down her street. She described the forum as "cute and 
politically oriented," but she said she was not happy with Galanter's written 
response to her complaint that said Venice was "designed for another era." 
</P>
<P>
Engineer Ed Barnett and retiree Harleigh Webber were favorably impressed with 
the evening. "I think she's doing a good job," said Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought she did very well tonight," Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
The only discord in an otherwise mellow night occurred when Marina Peninsula 
resident Donna Chaet screamed out at Galanter during the meeting and noisily 
confronted her afterward with complaints about problems on the peninsula. 
Galanter received applause when she told Chaet, "If you're not happy, take a 
walk and come back in five minutes."

After dominating the Los Angeles Unified School District's academic decathlon 
in the early 1980s, Palisades High School had been unsuccessful in recapturing 
the title for a number of years. But this year, Palisades regained the title, 
scoring 44,981 out of a possible 60,000 points and edging out defending 
champions El Camino Real High School. In March, the nine-member team will 
travel to UC Riverside for the statewide competition. 
</P>
<P>
Space exploration is the theme for this year's decathlon. Categories include 
math, history, science, economics, speech and fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to juggling difficult class schedules, team members spent countless 
hours outside of the classroom preparing for the competition. "All this 
studying has helped me learn to budget my time," said Neal Kaplan, who won a 
$750 scholarship for being one of the top-scoring students. Several other 
students received scholarships ranging from $500 to $1,000 for their 
performances in the decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the preparation was learning to work as a team. "In the beginning, we 
really didn't know each other but now we've gotten to be friends," said Ritu 
Batra. 
</P>
<P>
The team is coached by English literature teacher Rose Gilbert and speech, 
debate and English teacher, Donald Walz. The team's captain is David Elashoff. 
</P>
<P>
Representing Palisades in the state competition will be seniors Kaplan, 
Elashoff, Amir Berjis, Robert Brombach, Matthew Gelbart, Eddy Kup, Thatbiti 
Sabahive, Lesley Young and junior Batra. 
</P>

SHADES OF 'BACK-ROOM POLITICS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I never thought it could happen here." Famous last words. At the last Diamond 
Bar City Council meeting, what is fast becoming known as Diamond Bar's "Gang of 
Three" brought 1940s Chicago-style back-room politics to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
During what was effectively a closed meeting in public, Mayor (Gary) Werner 
(refusing to allow public comment) railroaded the issue of appointing a new 
member to the council. Council members Werner, (John) Forbing and (Jay) Kim 
(apparently ignoring that the voting public put them in office) then bypassed 
that most fundamental right of every American citizen -- the right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Their only argument to appoint was "holding a special election will cost almost 
$50,000, and we want to save taxpayer money." Fellows, it's our money, it's our 
right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
This City Council writes checks for some $300,000 every two weeks. They spend 
$250 for a plaque to give to an ex-council member telling him what a great job 
he did. They spent some $80,000 studying trash and still don't have a decision. 
Our basic "right to vote" apparently came in second best to the "right to 
choose a garbage man." Doesn't make much sense unless something else is going 
on behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, even if you play the game by their "new" rules, you 
lose. Council members Werner, Forbing and Kim decided to submit two candidates 
each, hold interviews and then decide between themselves who they wanted on the 
council. What a process. 
</P>
<P>
They interviewed seven "selected" applicants in less than 2 1/2 hours. That's 
political management Saddam Hussein style. Mayor Werner doesn't need a gun. He 
has a gavel. 
</P>
<P>
It is tragic that while we have sons and daughters on the front lines in Iraq, 
willing to fight and die so that we can to live in democracy's showcase, our 
"elected" officials sell their ethics and our birthright under the guise of "we 
know what's best for you." Thanks guys, but, no thanks.

APARTMENT LIFE: CAN MANAGER CASH IN ON RENT PAYMENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, Postema is the editor of Apartment Age magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My ex-husband and I pay the rent on our two daughters' Redondo Beach 
apartment while they are getting their college degrees. The second month they 
were in the apartment, the resident manager requested cash payment of the rent, 
saying he would provide a receipt. 
</P>
<P>
After we verified that his name was on the lease agreement as manager, we gave 
him the $800 cash. He, however, failed to sign the receipt. The girls brought 
it back to him to get his signature on it. He said he "forgot" to sign the 
receipt. 
</P>
<P>
He now says that he has the legal right to demand cash payment of the rent and 
that's what he wants. We don't appreciate that attitude, but it was expensive, 
in terms of both time and money, to move our daughters. We hesitate to force an 
issue only to have our daughters evicted. 
</P>
<P>
I am afraid that one of these months he will again "forget" to sign the receipt 
but will "remember" that the girls paid no rent. The lease agreement says 
nothing about the method of payment of the rent. 
</P>
<P>
Does he have the right to demand cash payment of the rent? Is there anything 
that we can do? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Since the lease agreement says nothing about the method of payment, the 
manager cannot require you to pay the rent in cash until he gives you a 30-day 
notice to change the terms of your daughters' tenancy. Once he gives you such a 
notice, you will have to pay the rent in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Although you can demand that the manager give you such a notice, it won't do 
you any good in the long run. It's probably better not to rock the boat. Just 
make sure that the manager signs the rent receipts. You are entitled signed 
receipts for your cash rent payments. 
</P>

<P>
Owners Owe Interest on Last Months' Rent 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own a Los Angeles apartment and I am writing in reference to the Nov. 25 
"Apartment Life" column. 
</P>
<P>
Under "Landlord Raises Deposit When He Raises Rent," you write, "The new law . 
. . requiring landlords to pay interest on security deposits and last months' 
rents requires them to pay interest on such deposits to tenants every five 
years." 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. ordinances, No. 168363 and No. 166373, require landlords to pay 
interest only on security deposits and not on last months' rents. The Rent 
Stabilization Division on the Ordinance Hot Line, (213) 624-7368, confirmed 
that the answer in the column is incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
A: There is a conflict between state and federal law that is likely causing the 
confusion. Under federal tax law, the last month's rent is considered income 
when collected. At that point, the income is taxable under federal law. Under 
state landlord/tenant law, last months' rents are considered deposits. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jim Fleck, director of research for the RSD, the interest payments 
apply to "all deposits, no matter how they are labeled, including last months' 
rents." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It Costs Landlords to Move Tenants Out 
</P>
<P>
Q: In the Oct. 27 column, "Landlord Pays Extra to Move Baby," you referred to 
the rights of a landlord when a tenant adds a baby to the apartment. Does that 
information refer to Santa Monica rent control as well? Also, what are the 
rights of a Santa Monica landlord when a tenant moves out and places someone 
else in that apartment without the landlord's approval? 
</P>
<P>
A: The column said that a Los Angeles landlord can evict tenants from a unit in 
order to move in family members. He must, however, pay the tenant's relocation 
fees, which, in Los Angeles, are either $2,000 or $5,000. Tenants with minor 
children, seniors or the handicapped get the $5,000. Others get $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, you can also evict tenants to move in certain family members, 
and you must also pay relocation fees. But the fees in Santa Monica are higher 
and structured differently than those in Los Angeles. In Santa Monica the fees 
are based upon the size of the unit and include an extra $1,000 for tenants 
with minor children, seniors or the handicapped. For Santa Monica, the amounts 
are as follows: Single/bachelor apartments, $3,000; one-bedroom apartments, 
$3,750; two-bedroom apartments, $4,250; three-bedroom apartments, $5,250; 
four-or-more-bedroom apartments, $5,500. 
</P>
<P>
When a tenant moves out and places an unauthorized subtenant in the unit 
without the landlord's approval, under most circumstances you are able to evict 
the unlawful subtenant. Exceptions to this rule of thumb may include the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
(1) The tenant is on an unexpired lease agreement, under which he's responsible 
for the unpaid rent until the unit is re-rented. If you unreasonably refuse to 
accept qualified replacement renters, you lose any further rent claim against 
the tenant; or (2) the unauthorized subtenant had lived in the unit before the 
tenant of record moved out and you knew about it, accepted rent (even if you 
merely accepted rent from the tenant of record and not the unauthorized 
subtenant) and made no effort to get him out of the unit. 
</P>
<P>
In this second example, most judges in California will rule that you have 
waived your right to evict by accepting the rent and taking no action to evict. 
There may be other exceptions, so check with your attorney before giving your 
tenant notice to move.

CUT EXPENSES IF YOUR JOB AT RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before you even consider using your home as a financial backstop, you'll want 
to have a firm grasp on how much you spend each month. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, visit your local stationery or business-supply store and purchase a 
"personal expense work sheet" or similar fill-in-the-blanks form that asks you 
to detail exactly how much money you spend each month and -- equally important 
-- how you spend it. 
</P>
<P>
"Take a hard look at all the expenses you have today, and decide which ones can 
be eliminated," said financial planner Jack Blankinship. "Do you really need a 
gardener, a pool cleaner or a maid to come in several times a month? Do you 
need to dine out as often as you do now? 
</P>
<P>
"If you think you might lose your job, eliminate these expenses now and start 
putting the money you'll save in the bank. If you eventually wind up out of 
work, you'll be able to tap your savings to make your mortgage payment or to 
pay other bills." 
</P>
<P>
If you seriously think that the future of your job is in jeopardy, you might 
also want to go out now and pick up a second job or do some free-lance work to 
supplement your income. 
</P>
<P>
"Put your extra earnings in a money market fund or some other type of safe 
investment, and only tap it if you need to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Also start getting those resumes out," said Dwain Greer, executive vice 
president of banking giant Shearson Lehman Mortgage Corp. "Don't wait until you 
get a pink slip before you start looking for a new job -- start looking for one 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Also tally up your total assets. If you fall on hard times, many financial 
experts say that you should sell your stocks, bonds, mutual-fund shares and the 
like before you tap the equity in your home. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget other possible sources of cash. Perhaps you have some jewelry, 
furs, a boat or an extra car that can be sold to raise money or lower your 
monthly debt burden. 
</P>
<P>
Life-insurance policies and annuities can often be cashed in or borrowed 
against at unusually low interest rates. It might even make sense to withdraw 
money from your retirement account, although you might suffer a nasty tax bite. 
</P>
<P>
Also consider consolidating your debts. "You might be able to save some money 
by taking out one big loan and paying off all your high-interest credit-cards 
and other debts," said banker Greer. 
</P>
<P>
Greer said the rate you pay on the bill consolidation loan will probably be 
much lower than the rate you pay on your credit cards. That would lower your 
monthly finance charges. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, bill consolidation loans -- unlike some auto loans, credit card 
bills and many other types of debt -- are usually paid back over several years. 
"By stringing your debt out over a longer period of time, you'll lower your 
overall monthly payments," Greer said.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: THE HOLIDAY SEASON MAY NOT BE THE BEST TIME OF YEAR TO 
GO IT ALONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I have had my home on the market for sale about 6 weeks. I have 
advertised it every day and hold open houses each Saturday and Sunday. The 
market for home sales is slow in our town, but I know my home is priced 
reasonably because I am asking less than a similar home is listed for in the 
next block. 
</P>
<P>
I estimate that 25 prospective buyers and 10 real estate brokers have inspected 
my house so far, but I have not received any offers. What should I do to get my 
home sold quickly? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You missed most of the fall selling season for homes. Now we are 
entering the slowest time of ear for home sales, between Thanksgiving and New 
Year's. Even the best real estate agents have difficulty selling homes during 
this time of year, when few people want to move. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a regular reader of this column, then you know I do not advocate 
selling your home alone without a professional real estate agent. The risk is 
too high that you will make a costly mistake. Not being able to obtain a 
purchase offer from one of those 25 prospects has already cost you extra 
mortgage, property tax and maintenance expenses. Perhaps your home is 
overpriced or it has other drawbacks that prospective buyers don't like. 
</P>
<P>
You only have one home to sell, but the local realty agents can show buyers 
hundreds of homes for sale through the local multiple-listing service. I 
suggest you bite the bullet and list your home for sale with your town's best 
real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
Ask your friends, neighbors and business associates for recommendations. 
Interview at least three agents who sell homes in your neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But before listing your home with an agent, ask each agent for a list of their 
most recent home sales with the names and phones of the sellers. Then call 
those people to inquire if they were in any way unhappy with their agent and if 
they would list their home with the same agent again. You will soon know which 
agent should get your listing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keep Buyers Out of House Until Sale Closes 
</P>
<P>
Q: I sold my home to a nice young couple. They are getting an FHA mortgage and 
it is taking forever. Since they moved here from out of town and are staying in 
a motel, they want to move into my house before the mortgage papers are ready. 
Do you think I should allow them to do so? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. The big problem with allowing home buyers to occupy the residence before 
the sale is recorded is the buyers will surely discover some little defect 
which will hold up the closing of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Another difficulty is you must keep up the insurance while the buyer occupies 
your home. If a loss results, there can be problems. I do not recommend you let 
your buyer move into the home before the sale is recorded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quitclaim Deed Means Nothing Without Title 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I obtained title to our home from his mother. We are buying 
the house from her. What concerns us is we have only a quitclaim deed. Should 
we obtain a warranty of some sort? 
</P>
<P>
A: A quitclaim deed means the grantor conveys whatever title she owned in the 
property. It can be the conveyance of a full fee simple absolute title. Or it 
can be delivery of no title at all if the grantor didn't own the property. 
</P>
<P>
For example, I can give you a quitclaim deed to the Empire State Building, but 
it conveys no title rights because I don't own the Empire State Building. 
</P>
<P>
But a quitclaim deed is perfectly safe if you also obtain an owner's title 
insurance policy. If you did not buy such a policy at the time you obtained the 
quitclaim deed, I suggest you buy an owner's title policy now. It will protect 
you against many unexpected title risks which even the world's greatest title 
searcher cannot discover, such as forged signatures in the chain of title. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lease Option Protected by Rights of Occupants 
</P>
<P>
Q: Following your advice we negotiated a terrific lease option. The home seller 
is giving us a 100% rent credit toward our down payment. However, he does not 
want us to record our purchase option. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred to me that the seller, a rather slippery character, might try to 
sell our home again. We definitely plan to exercise our purchase option. Do you 
think we have a big problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. The buyer of any property takes title subject to the rights of the 
occupants. Since you have a valid lease option agreement, you need not be 
concerned. Please consult a local real estate attorney for more details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Thoughts on Realtor's Sale Tactics 
</P>
<P>
Q: We bought our home about five months ago and are very happy with it. 
However, I have been wondering if the real estate agent did anything wrong. We 
met her at a Sunday open house. As she showed us through the home, we said it 
was nice but the price seemed too high for us. Then she told us that in her 
opinion her listing was overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
When I asked what price the seller would take, she said she didn't know, but 
she would be willing to present our offer about $20,000 below the asking price. 
We knew that would be a bargain, so we agreed to make such an offer. The seller 
accepted our offer that evening. Two things concern me. One is whether the 
listing agent encouraged us to make a low-ball offer. The second is the 
seller's acceptance of our first offer with no negotiation. Do you think we 
were set up? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. The real estate agent probably knew her listing was overpriced. However, 
the agent often has no choice but to accept an overpriced listing or not take 
the listing at all. When I was selling real estate as an agent, I often took 
overpriced listings with the understanding the seller would reduce the asking 
price if no purchase offers materialized. 
</P>
<P>
As for the agent's encouraging you to make an offer $20,000 below the asking 
price, there is nothing wrong with that. Perhaps the agent knew the seller 
might accept such an offer. Of course, it would be unethical for her to tell 
you the seller would accept such an offer. 
</P>
<P>
I see nothing wrong with the listing agent's sales tactics. She was using good 
salesmanship to get you to make an offer. The final decision was the seller's, 
not the agent's. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing I would be concerned about is that your first offer was 
accepted. I know how bad that feels because that means the seller might have 
sold for a lower price if you had offered less. But be happy with your bargain 
and forget about how you stole that home from the poor unsuspecting seller. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
House Values Fluctuate With Local Economy 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been trying to figure out why houses don't depreciate in value as 
they grow older and parts wear out, just as cars depreciate as they get older. 
</P>
<P>
A: Physically, homes depreciate due to wear, tear and obsolescence. But a 
sound, well-located home usually maintains its value or appreciates in market 
value if the local economy is sound and jobs are being created to keep people 
moving into the area. 
</P>
<P>
However, if jobs decline and people move away from the vicinity, then home 
prices stagnate or decline. It is usually outside economic forces which cause 
homes to lose value, not their physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Illness No Ground for Extention of Roll-Over 
</P>
<P>
Q: Shortly after we sold our home I became too ill to look for the replacement 
home that would defer our profit tax. I contacted the IRS and my congressman, 
but have been unable to find out how to get a six-month extension of the time I 
need to buy a replacement home. How can I do this? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, but Internal Revenue Code 1034 has no provision for granting any 
extension of the 24-month time limit for buying a replacement home of equal or 
greater cost, so you can defer the profit tax on the sale of your old home. For 
further details, please consult your attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Former Tenant Seeks Recovery of Deposit 
</P>
<P>
Q: I rented an apartment on a month-to-month tenancy. After several months I 
decided to move out. I had a $250 security deposit. I left the apartment 
spotless. But the landlord kept my deposit because she says it is her policy to 
repaint apartments after each tenant moves out. My apartment doesn't need 
repainting, since I don't smoke and none of my friends do either. How can I get 
my $250 back? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your first step is to make a written demand on your landlord for refund of 
your security deposit within 15 days. If you don't receive your money, small 
claims court or housing court is the place to sue for your deposit refund.

CRESTED BUTTE: THE LITTLE SKI TOWN THAT CARES

CRESTED BUTTE, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hot chocolate and keep it coming," I pleaded as I sank into the cozy booth at 
Bubba's, the mid-mountain restaurant tucked into the Paradise Warming House in 
this Colorado resort town. 
</P>
<P>
Leaky boots and Popsicle toes, the bane of my ski life, led me to start 
dismantling my ski boots while waiting for my burger. 
</P>
<P>
The mega-burger came and the waiter, seeing my plight, offered to take the 
inner lining of my boots to the back and put them in the clothes dryer. 
</P>
<P>
This is what sets Crested Butte apart from other towns like it -- people really 
care here. Sounds corny, but it's true. 
</P>
<P>
It's only 20 miles over the hill from Aspen, as the crow flies, but Crested 
Butte might as well be 2,000 miles away. As the most isolated and arguably 
least known of Colorado's winter resorts, the area has virtually nothing in 
common with its neighbor, other than the smattering of restored 1880s 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Colorado's historic mountain towns have been rebuilt to the point where 
they bear little resemblance to their early look. In Crested Butte, most of the 
buildings have remained "original equipment," giving a very special feel to 
this National Historic District. 
</P>
<P>
This is Western skiing at its best. Wide open, uncrowded, sunny, plenty of 
powder, long beginner/intermediate cruising trails and double-black-diamond 
tough stuff on the hidden back side. 
</P>
<P>
Just a word or two about this "hidden back side." Until a few years ago, 
adrenaline junkies had to hike for 20 minutes to reach the ungroomed powder 
stashes of the North Face and Phoenix Bowl. In 1987, the resort decided to 
access the steep, rugged terrain with a two-minute lift, yet maintain the wild, 
back-country flavor. It's now a Mecca for adventure-minded experts. 
</P>
<P>
Crested Butte is also great for walking, loaded as it is with restaurants, 
shops and interesting nooks and crannies. A walk down Elk Avenue, along blocks 
of authentic Victorian buildings, provides a reminder of how the town appeared 
in the 1880s. The wooden floors are uneven and the walls are the same ones 
Butch Cassidy saw when he came through town and had a drink at Kochevar's 
Saloon and Gaming Hall, which still operates today. 
</P>
<P>
This is an eating, drinking town. You'll be welcome in the most elegant 
restaurants in your turtleneck and ski parka. The charm is raw and genuine and 
a little rough around the edges, but it's real. 
</P>
<P>
Actually there are two Crested Buttes. One is the aforementioned Victorian 
mining town, the other is the ski village, Crested Butte Mountain Resort on Mt. 
Crested Butte, which is three miles down the road by free shuttle bus. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Crested Butte is where most of the glitz is found, ranging from condos and 
lodges to the hedonistic Grande Butte Hotel. The ski village has its own share 
of shops and restaurants, but come nightfall, the action is in town. The 
shuttle buses run all the time, so it's just plain silly to have a car here. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best-kept secrets in the ski world is just 12 miles from Crested 
Butte. It's the Irwin Lodge. Located at 10,700 feet, it's accessible only by 
snowcat or snowmobile during the winter. The lodge is an immense 
27,000-square-foot cedar log structure with 23 guest rooms, all with private 
baths, and the most romantic luxury suite I've ever seen. When you arrive at 
Irwin Lodge, you have found the ultimate getaway. Your private ski mountain. 
</P>
<P>
The lodge has a snowcat powder skiing operation that is the adventure of a 
lifetime. With an average base of 365 inches of snow -- up to 100 feet of snow 
falls during the season -- there's virtually no ski day when there won't be 
great deep powder conditions. In fact, since management puts only 48 people a 
day on their terrain, they can guarantee that at no time will your tracks cross 
those of another skier. 
</P>
<P>
A day-trip for a Crested Butte Mountain Resort guest runs $140, with group 
discounts available. A package with lodging, meals and skiing starts at $161 
per day. Comparing this with helicopter skiing, which can cost about $500 a 
day, one realizes what a really good deal this is. 
</P>
<P>
If helicopter skiing is your thing, Irwin Lodge has customized helicopter tours 
offering quick access to numerous peaks and slopes in the company's permit area 
for spectacular first-track descents. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to alpine skiing, the lodge offers cross-country equipment and 
trails, plus ice fishing, snowshoeing and snowmobile tours. 
</P>
<P>
A number of all-inclusive special vacations are available, including powder 
skiing weeks at Irwin Lodge or combined Silvergate/Crested Butte Mount Resort 
packages. For Irwin Lodge, call (303) 349-5308, or book through Crested Butte 
Vacations at (800) 544-8448. 
</P>
<P>
You can't talk about skiing without talking about snowfall. There are so many 
contradictory claims that it's hard to know who to believe, but here's an 
independent source: According to statistics gathered from 1951 to 1985 by the 
Colorado Climate Center at Colorado State University, Crested Butte has the 
highest average annual snowfall of any ski town in Colorado -- 229 inches. 
Also-rans include Telluride (184.6), Steamboat (172.2) and Breckenridge (162). 
</P>
<P>
One of the things I like best about Crested Butte is that it is off the beaten 
path. It's remote but accessible. That may seem to be a contradiction in terms, 
but it's true. Just 28 miles down the road is Gunnison Airport, which is served 
by numerous airlines. This kind of convenience lets you pack more skiing into 
your valuable vacation time. 
</P>
<P>
I love a big mountain with just enough skiers on it to make it interesting. And 
I hate lift lines. This is where Crested Butte shines. With 854 skiable acres 
and a bed base for only 3,000 people, the town can be full but the mountain is 
not. The only lift line I ever encountered was a five-minute wait at 2 p.m. on 
the Paradise lift taking skiers back onto the mountain after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Crested Butte is both a close-knit community and a real destination resort. 
Other than Gunnison, which is actually a small town, it's not close to any 
large city, so it does not have the influx of day-skiers. Saturday afternoon is 
just about the same as Tuesday morning. The hotels and condos were pretty well 
sold out when I was there, and still not a lift line to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
One telephone number books everything from airline tickets, hotels, car rentals 
and lift tickets to on-mountain barbecues. Call (800) 525-4220. 
</P>
<P>
You can fly from Los Angeles to Gunnison via American Airlines, United/United 
Express, Delta or Continental/Continental Express. A good shuttle service is 
available from the airport, thus a rental car isn't necessary.

CONSUMER REPORT: HOW TO HANDLE THE SLIPPERY SLOPES OF CHOOSING THE RIGHT SKI 
VACATION; 
</P>
<P>
PACKAGES: THERE ARE MANY DEALS AVAILABLE AS RESORTS AND AIRLINES COMPETE FOR 
BUSINESS. SKIERS SHOULD DEFINE THEIR NEEDS AND ASK PLENTY OF QUESTIONS.

<P>
For the uninformed, purchasing a ski vacation may be as complicated as 
purchasing a vehicle. Many considerations cloud the dream. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 25 major resorts in the West alone, and with a variety of 
packagers competing for the skier's dollar, skiers should know which questions 
to ask so they won't be disappointed when a resort doesn't turn out to be what 
was expected. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to know what you want out of a ski vacation and articulate that 
when purchasing a package in order to make an appropriate choice," says Holly 
Rouillard of the Colorado Tourism Board. 
</P>
<P>
Do you want a self-contained ski community designed for the skiing family, 
where every expense can be charged to the room and where nursery and teen 
centers help free parents to enjoy their vacation? Or is big name glitz and 
night life as important as the skiing? 
</P>
<P>
Do you want a taste of the Old West, perhaps a mining town-turned-resort with 
Victorian relics tucked in the Rockies, remote from the fast lane and immune 
from lift lines? Or do you want to station yourself in the center of several 
ski areas where you can ski a different resort each day? 
</P>
<P>
When you know your own needs, the next step is to learn the options. In the 
fall, most metropolitan areas have consumer ski shows where ski areas and trip 
packagers display their offerings. Ask them about the ambience of the town, the 
vertical drop of the ski area, the ratio of beginner to intermediate and 
advanced runs, the percentage of the mountain groomed nightly, the average 
weekend lift line wait, child-care facilities, the months when good skiing is 
expected -- and begin making comparisons of what you find. 
</P>
<P>
Ski packages generally fall into three categories: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Resort packages covering lodging, lift tickets and possibly lessons, sold 
directly by the resort; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ground packages covering lodging, lift tickets and transfers to and from an 
airport; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Complete packages, including air fare. 
</P>
<P>
The last two types are packaged by airlines or travel wholesalers and sold 
directly at consumer ski shows, through travel agencies or by calling toll-free 
numbers advertised in newspaper travel sections and ski magazines, sporting 
goods stores and ski shows. 
</P>
<P>
Although all full-service travel agencies can book ski packages, smaller ones 
may book so few that they may not be too familiar with the variety offered. 
More important, they may know very little about ski jargon -- for example, 
whether a 1,500-foot vertical mountain would be challenging to an advanced 
skier for a full week or would completely bore him or her by the second day. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it might be better for the skier unfamiliar with a resort to book through 
a specialty packager and get information directly from the ski industry. 
</P>
<P>
Ski packagers usually offer slightly reduced air fare and accommodations 
because they deal in volume. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado and Utah have marketing associations that disseminate a wealth of 
information in their ski planning guides. The guide produced by the Ski Utah 
group covers 14 resorts, while Colorado Ski Country describes 28. Information 
listed includes location and distance from airport, terrain description, season 
schedule, elevation and vertical drop, average snowfall, lift ticket and lesson 
rates, special services such as nursery and children's ski school, and lodging 
options. "The average savings of trip packages over individually priced items 
is generally 5% to 10%, but that increases dramatically for trips booked far in 
advance or at the last minute, when there is additional discounting," said 
Marty Melcher, director of Advance Reservations, a Park City, Utah-based ski 
trip packager. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a three-night package at the Stein Eriksen Lodge in Deer Valley, 
Utah, including lift tickets, air fare, ground transportation and lodging, is 
priced at $649 until next Sunday. Priced separately, the same items total 
$1,005. 
</P>
<P>
According to Melcher, on a weeklong trip the average skier pays $170 per day on 
individually priced items, compared to $140 per day for the average package. 
</P>
<P>
"But more than price, the advantage of ski packages is in the simplicity," says 
Andrew Mathieson, senior product planner for United Airlines, which packages a 
number of ski trips primarily in the West, called "Instant Vacations Ski 
Packages." 
</P>
<P>
Skiers should make sure that they understand any packager's cancellation 
policy. Although there is no industry standard for cancellations, here are some 
things to remember: 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the major portion of the resort is not operational due to lack of snow, 
the resort usually refunds that part of the package covering lift tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As for the accommodations themselves, cancellations rarely occur without 
charge. Policies generally depend on length of prior notice. Some may not offer 
refunds; others may charge an administrative fee of $100 and refund the rest 
only if they can re-book the room. Still others give a credit for future use, a 
policy often followed by airlines, too. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In order to eliminate potential difficulties, most trip packagers advise 
taking out cancellation insurance. For a nominal fee ($20 for a typical $500 
ground transportation package), the insurance carrier will grant full refunds 
if the buyer shows proper cause -- usually a medical or business emergency, not 
just poor snow conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If air fare is included in the package, a credit is usually given rather 
than a full refund, even with insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Skiers should be aware of the risks when booking the early or late season. 
Unfortunately, it is precisely those high-risk times that are good buys. Many 
resorts have four price ratings for accommodations, depending on time of 
season. 
</P>
<P>
It's important that skiers always ask these questions before booking a ski 
package: 
</P>
<P>
 -- What exactly is included? Lessons? Interchangeable lift tickets? 
Airport-to-resort transportation? Lodging tax? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is there a refund for unused lift tickets? What non-ski activities are 
available? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How convenient are the lodgings? Is it a ski-in/ski-out facility where no 
transportation is needed? If so, how far a walk is it? Uphill? Should one rent 
a car? If so, is the car part of the package? Is it "winterized?" Is there a 
free shuttle to the lifts? Does the lodging have free airport pickup service? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What amenities are available at the lodgings? Ski lockers? Jacuzzi and 
pool? Teen game room? Maid service? Laundry? Is there a grocery store and range 
of restaurants within walking distance? Or is there only a lodge dining room? 
In the mountains, especially without a vehicle, one must not assume anything. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is equipment rental included in the package or is a discount offered with 
the package? 
</P>
<P>
 -- For packages that include air transportation, if the plane must land 
elsewhere due to storms, who pays the additional ground transportation costs? 
Who pays for overnight lodging if any is needed? If a day's skiing is missed, 
is there a refund of lodging and lift tickets? 
</P>
<P>
 -- How reputable is the packager? It all adds up to this: The more you know, 
not only before you go, but before you choose where to go, the better time 
you'll have. Be aware that terms such as "deluxe," "close," "ski-in/ski-out," 
"some obstacles on the slopes" and "just cause for cancellation" have no 
standard interpretation.

SKI THE WORLD'S HIGHEST SLOPE ONLY IF YOU MUST

LA PAZ, Bolivia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's inevitable. Somewhere along the way, every skier is touched by a yearning 
to ski the world's highest ski area. Perhaps because there is a love of 
superlatives that goes hand in hand with skiing -- the longest run, the 
steepest run, the fastest time, the best skiing . . . and the highest ski area. 
</P>
<P>
Though the word highest is terribly overused in the ski world, experts agree 
that the true "world's highest ski area" is Chacaltaya, about 35 miles 
northeast of La Paz in Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
Now before you say, "All right, I'm off to add the Chacaltaya patch to my 
collection," I'd best explain two things. First, Chacaltaya does not offer the 
type of skiing to merit a $900 plane ticket, especially when you think of the 
skiing that $900 will buy in the North American Rockies. And second, you must 
be a confirmed masochist to want to battle the rarefied air that makes physical 
activity difficult and eye-popping headaches a big part of the ski day. 
</P>
<P>
Chacaltaya seems best suited for skiers so obsessed with the unconventional 
that they'll put up with any kind of discomfort or inconvenience to find it. 
</P>
<P>
Consider these "qualifications": a summit at about 18,000 feet, 1,000 vertical 
feet of ski run, one lift (but no crowds) and a season stretching from December 
to March. 
</P>
<P>
If you've ever felt light-headed in the Rockies, imagine how you might feel a 
mile higher at 18,000 feet. My ears buzzed. I puffed like a Kenworth going up 
the Continental Divide, and I kept popping aspirina to relieve the throbbing 
behind my eyes -- the first symptoms of soroche (altitude sickness). 
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-foot ski run actually seemed to be at best 600 feet, though maybe the 
altitude or the Coriolis effect skews one's perception of distance. Whatever 
the true vertical measurement, it's more than enough to get a good bit of 
skiing and also test one's grip on the thin cable tow. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, the ski season is the same as ours, which is the South American summer. 
This is because the run, actually a glacier, is too icy to ski the rest of the 
year. Only from December to March does it become soft enough to welcome skiers. 
</P>
<P>
The crown of the area is a chalet, set upon a dizzying ledge. A rock thrown 
from there could roll all the way to La Paz. In fact, it's so frightening and 
looks so shaky that some skiers refuse to enter. Then again, some skiers don't 
even put their skis on when they reach Chacaltaya, asking instead to be taken 
immediately back to La Paz. Club Andino, which manages the area, has a truck 
ready for this contingency. 
</P>
<P>
Since there are no accommodations at the mountain, the city of La Paz serves as 
the resort base. It's something like skiing Alta or Snowbird from Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that La Paz down there in that big ditch?" another American asked as we 
flew over the city to make our landing. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, that was La Paz. It's a strange sight -- large white buildings and 
highways fill the bottom of the canyon. Wretched little shacks attempt to climb 
the walls. At nearly 12,000 feet, the city is the second-highest capital in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The views from Chacaltaya are first-rate. In the south, La Paz can be seen 
peaking up from its burrow, white and sparkling. In the north, the Cordillera 
Real Mountains cut the stratosphere. You see teardrop lakes hung among the 
sharp-edged peaks. To the west, the hazy outline of Lake Titicaca looks 
something like a puddle on the gigantic altiplano that stretches for hundreds 
of miles between Bolivia and Peru. 
</P>
<P>
The altiplano fills almost all of the mountains' western stage. At 13,000 feet, 
it is so dusty and hot-cold that it could probably serve as one of Dante's 
circles of hell. Only the toughest Indians live on it. From Chacaltaya, it 
looks like a flat raceway for cloud shadows. 
</P>
<P>
The east holds less stark vistas than the altiplano. On clear days, you can see 
all the way across the Andean Cordillera to the Amazon Basin. That verdant 
horizon is where the country's notorious cocaine industry flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
Club Andino offers daily bus service to Chacaltaya, leaving at 8:30 a.m. from 
the club office at Avenida Mexico 1638 in La Paz. The office opens at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
On our way to Chacaltaya in the Club Andino microbus, the trip leader talked 
about the skiing to come. He said that the run would be frozen solid when we 
arrived in the morning, but would soften to a very pleasant consistency by 
noon. 
</P>
<P>
First we had to get to the area, though, and at the rate we were going, it 
seemed like our group of eight, most of us foreigners, would be lucky to arrive 
by noon. 
</P>
<P>
Once out of the La Paz canyon, the road goes from asphalt to dust -- that's 
dust, not dirt. In one place it came up to the wheel hubs. This continued until 
the final ascent up Mt. Chacaltaya, where the dust changed to rocks the size of 
bowling balls. I felt sorry for the straining vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
When we finally reached the chalet, after a road trip of 1 1/2 hours that 
seemed more like 3 1/2, the first thing we did was shake some of the dirt out 
of our clothes. 
</P>
<P>
After that I walked into the shaky chalet, examined the Zermatt and Davos ski 
posters and searched out water to wash down two aspirin. Our trip leader 
inquired about cranking up the cable tow. 
</P>
<P>
The run is close by the chalet. It's a slightly doglegged swath of snow that is 
narrowest at the top and widest in the middle, where it bends to the left. It 
ends abruptly in a stack of brown rocks. The run is lined with similar rocks 
from top to bottom. No enchanted forests up there. 
</P>
<P>
The first step on the slope revealed the unusual nature of Bolivian snow. It 
was like a big carpet of Styrofoam, decorated with the little ripples and lumps 
that are God-given parts of glaciers. Slope grooming is an unknown practice 
here. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't tell whether it was just me or the dull Club Andino rental skis, but 
I couldn't carve a turn on that styrosnow. It's comparable to skiing what is 
called "breakable crust" at other ski venues. I had a hard time controlling my 
direction and speed, both vital on a rock-lined run. In time, I learned that it 
was best to hold a tight line down the middle, where the two dozen weekly 
skiers had etched a fairly hospitable path. 
</P>
<P>
It must be reported that the run never reached the soft, pleasant condition 
that the trip leader had promised. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, maybe we didn't stay long enough. After two hours, most everyone 
had had their fill. I had a painful soroche headache and was more than willing 
to stop. 
</P>
<P>
The group sentiment was unanimous: "Vamos a La Paz ahorita!" 
</P>
<P>
The descending microbus was quickly transformed into an ambulance for sick and 
exhausted skiers. Few words were spoken. I thought of the old saying about ski 
areas: "You have to ski it to believe it." This does not quite apply to 
Chacaltaya. After skiing it, I still couldn't believe it.

SCALING HEIGHTS OF NEW MEXICO CAVE DWELLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1880, Swiss-born anthropologist and archeologist Adolph Bandelier traveled 
to New Mexico to explore the cave dwellings of Frijoles Canyon. Calling the 
place "the grandest thing I ever saw," he settled in Santa Fe and spent the 
rest of his life studying the ancestors of the Pueblo Indians, who once 
occupied the steep-walled canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Today, visitors to Bandelier National Monument can explore nearly 50 square 
miles of wilderness, but the most popular area remains the series of short 
trails in Frijoles Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The monument receives about 350,000 visitors annually, mostly in the summer. 
It's open year-round (closed only on Christmas Day). 
</P>
<P>
But winter may be the best time to make the 50-mile trip from Santa Fe. Legend 
has it that the sun rises at the entrance of the east-facing pueblo on the day 
of the winter solstice. Santa Fe-bound skiers could really enjoy a detour to 
the monument. 
</P>
<P>
Frijoles Canyon is interesting not only for its archeological significance, but 
for its geological origins. When the massive Jemez Volcano blew its top a 
million years ago, it threw volcanic ash and basalt five miles into the air. 
When the material settled, it lay 1,000 feet thick over 400 square miles. 
Canyons were cut through the compacting ash by creeks flowing to the Rio 
Grande, and the "Swiss cheese" caves and cave-ettes were formed by the uneven 
cooling of gases. 
</P>
<P>
These caves were later occupied by the Anasazi -- ancestors of the Pueblo 
Indians who inhabited Frijoles Canyon from approximately AD 1200 to 1550. The 
canyon provided a subsistence living for the Anasazi, who grew blue corn, 
squash and beans and hunted deer and other animals. They moved on when the land 
was exhausted and could no longer support the population. 
</P>
<P>
The best introduction to the national monument and the best way to see the 
cliff dwellings is via the self-guided interpretive trail through Frijoles 
Canyon. Highlights of the path include a ceremonial kiva and the ruins of a 
600-year-old village. 
</P>
<P>
Note that to reach the cliff dwellings at the end of the trail, you'll have to 
scale some ladders. This is not an activity for the clumsy or those scared of 
heights. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the two-mile-long canyon trail and a couple of miles of side trails, 
the national monument also boasts more than 70 miles of maintained back-country 
trails. Paths lead to caves and pueblo ruins, the gorge of Alamo Canyon and 
White Rock Canyon of the Rio Grande. The Bandelier back-country trails also 
lead to the adjoining Dome Wilderness and Santa Fe National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Day-hikes that are particularly recommended are the 5.5-mile round trip to the 
Rio Grande and the 12-mile round-trip trek to Stone Lions Shrine. Ask park 
rangers for the latest trail conditions. Wilderness permits are required. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trail head: Bandelier National Monument is 46 miles west of Santa 
Fe off New Mexico 4. From Santa Fe, travel north on U.S. 285 to Pojoaque, west 
on New Mexico 502, then south on New Mexico 4 to the national monument. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Begin at the handsome adobe-styled Visitor Center, which is a 
National Historic Landmark. Built during the Depression by the Civilian 
Conservation Corps, it was built to last, with solid construction, hand-carved 
benches and handmade lamps. Tour the displays of artifacts and take in the 
slide show and movie for additional interpretation. You can even sign up for a 
guided ranger tour. 
</P>
<P>
Frijoles Canyon is well marked. Numbers along the self-guided trail refer to 
the interpretive brochure available for purchase at the Visitor Center. 
</P>
<P>
You pass first through the farming area, then past a longhouse and a storage 
silo. Rock art and intriguing cliff dwellings hollowed out of the canyon walls 
are sights to remember. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the interpreted trail is the ceremonial cave. To enter the cave, 
you must ascend a series of four nearly vertical ladders with no hand-holds. 
Those with heart or respiratory difficulties or fear of heights should not 
attempt this part of the walk (remember the mile-high altitude). 
</P>
<P>
For those who decide to explore the cave, it's an awe-inspiring adventure and 
an opportunity to feel much closer to the ancient ones who once made their 
lives in this quiet canyon. This kiva site was unearthed in 1908. Sit in one of 
the tiny caves, contemplate the pine trees 140 feet below, and bask in the warm 
rays of the setting sun. 
</P>
<P>
Bandelier National Monument is a great place to reflect on another time, 
another people.

Last month when I was in New York, I took the boat to Ellis Island. 
</P>
<P>
I imagined that I was my mother or father as we approached. They were Irish. 
Sailing past the Statue of Liberty and then stopping at the Great Hall, would 
they be accepted? What would await them? How would my father get to Butte to 
work in the copper mines? The dedication of those who restored Ellis Island is 
to be lauded. I loved every inch and was proud to see my parents' names 
engraved on the immigrant wall.

NO TOMORROW FOR WRIGHT LANDMARK?

<TEXT>
<P>
The "Building of Tomorrow" that Frank Lloyd Wright built 69 years ago has 
survived the worst of man and nature. But the great architect's legacy may meet 
its match in Tokyo's land fever. 
</P>
<P>
Marked by the horizontal planes and simple wood and mortar of Wright's "Prairie 
style," the building sits cracked and leaking on a green square of land 
encroached by high-rises and construction cranes in one of Tokyo's busier 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
The approximately 3,000-square-yard plot owned by Jiyu Gakuen, or Freedom 
School, is worth at least $230 million, according to the school's president, 
Gyo Hani. 
</P>
<P>
That may prove to be an offer the school cannot refuse. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over Myonichikan, or "Building of Tomorrow," points up more 
than just the dominance of assets over aesthetics in Tokyo's constantly 
changing skyline, where few traditional structures remain since the firebombing 
of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Architectural landmarks are rare and legal protections weak in a nation with a 
habit of rebuilding itself from fires, earthquakes and war. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, says Prof. Hiroyuki Suzuki of Tokyo University, artistry bows to 
function. "Generally speaking, Japanese love new buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Wright himself, the father of organic architecture, preached that "the building 
should be a natural circumstance of the land." But the fields and farmhouses 
amid which he built Myonichikan in 1921 are no longer there. Today, the 
building is used as a center for craft making and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
Hani insists that there is no plan to sell, but he says financial security is 
his first priority as head of Jiyu Gakuen, now a 25-acre campus about 10 miles 
north of the site. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Wright came in here today, he wouldn't have built it like this. . . . 
It shows spaciousness," Hani says. "I doubt the value of that building standing 
there amid many ugly high-rise buildings." 
</P>
<P>
The president has resisted efforts by alumni and Tokyo architects to have the 
government declare the building an Important Cultural Asset. 
</P>
<P>
Such a decision, which is made by private owners in Japan, would obligate the 
government to pay 50% of the funds needed to rebuild Myonichikan. But it would 
also obligate Hani not to sell the land. 
</P>
<P>
Hani's cousin, Yuko Hani, is seeking to raise the estimated $2 million needed 
to save Myonichikan. Both are related to the school's founders. 
</P>
<P>
"If Japan is a great economic power, why doesn't it spend money on preserving 
these cultural assets?" Yuko Hani asked. "In that sense we certainly can't call 
ourselves a civilized nation, can we?" 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who died in 1959, designed the building while in Tokyo to supervise the 
construction of his Imperial Hotel, which was later razed. Along with a private 
home near Osaka, Myonichikan is the only Wright building left in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin O. Reischauer, the former U.S. ambassador to Japan who died this year, 
wrote that Myonichikan "symbolized Japan's search in the 1920s to become a 
liberal, innovative nation and a free democratic society." 
</P>
<P>
Gyo Hani says symbols are nice, but with $230 million in land underneath, "we 
don't want to commit our posterity to giving up important assets."

For three years, this 53.4-acre asphalt wasteland in the heart of the most 
expensive real estate in the world has gone virtually unused. 
</P>
<P>
The government-owned former rail yard, worth an estimated $24 billion to $47 
billion, is surrounded by headquarters of mighty banks and corporations. It is 
a jarring sight, somewhat as Manhattan might look with an empty space where 
Rockefeller Center now stands. But no one can buy it. 
</P>
<P>
To find out why entails a Lewis Carroll-like journey through land policies that 
Western experts say defy economic logic and absurdly inflate Tokyo's land 
prices, which run 30 to 100 times higher than those of other major cities 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Such government policies have left Japan's huge landholding corporations 
swimming in assets and made many homeowners paper millionaires. But they have 
also created a large class of have-nots that threatens Japan's prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials say they cannot put the Shiodome rail yard on the market 
just yet because it is too valuable. The lot is as much as 50 times pricier 
than the approximately $850 million Japan's Mitsubishi Estate Co. paid for a 
share of the 22-acre Rockefeller Center last year. 
</P>
<P>
The rail yard's sudden availability to speculators would bid up real estate 
prices to even more astronomical levels, officials say, although they 
acknowledge that such a policy runs contrary to the law of supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
"Normal economic theory doesn't seem to work when it comes to land in Japan, 
because there is overwhelmingly more demand for land than supply," said Hiroshi 
Yoneda, the Transportation Ministry official in charge of the yard. 
</P>
<P>
Western experts, some of whom have lived here for years, are aghast at such 
reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
"Raising supply usually lowers prices. Anyone who doesn't know that should go 
back and take Economics 101," scoffed Robert Feldman, an economist at Salomon 
Bros., a New York financial house. 
</P>
<P>
But this is Japan, where an alchemy of postwar tax policy, easy money and 
Japanese "herd" behavior has turned land into gold. 
</P>
<P>
Like gold's fabled ability to inspire greed, the hunger for land on this small 
archipelago crowded with 120 million people has created rapacious speculators 
who have become the stuff of movies and TV dramas. 
</P>
<P>
"Land sharks" eager to resell properties hire thugs who spend months banging 
noisemakers or setting fires to hound families from buildings they have 
occupied for generations. Real estate executives have been held hostage by 
extremists outraged over inadequate housing. 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, land fever has divided Japan into two economic classes -- those 
who own land, usually through an inheritance, and those who cannot afford it. 
Too often, the landless are the younger, baby-producing generation. 
</P>
<P>
That looms as a potential disaster. Japan had the world's lowest birthrate last 
year at 10.2 babies per 1,000 people. In surveys, many women attribute their 
unwillingness to have children in part to the rented "rabbit hutch" apartments 
they must squeeze into with little room for family. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, policy-makers worry, this so-called "child shock" could undermine 
the nation's industrial might. Japan, already suffering a labor shortage, could 
become top-heavy with too many elderly pensioners supported by too few younger 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the long-governing conservative Liberal Democratic Party has had 
little motivation to act. High land prices have been popular with its major 
constituencies: the 60% of Japanese who already own homes and the large 
corporations that have watched their portfolio assets swell. 
</P>
<P>
But the catastrophic potential of the boom may nudge government into action. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 30, a 1% tax on land holdings was suggested to drive down prices 
gradually. According to one survey, high interest rates and an economic 
slowdown already have reduced residential land prices by 10% to 30% in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The government is moving gingerly, fearful that falling prices would jolt 
corporations with large holdings of real estate and stocks. Many are already 
reeling from the Tokyo Stock Exchange's nose-dive this year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government must untangle 45 years of often bizarre tax and 
lending policies that have made Tokyo a sea of two-story homes instead of 
desperately needed high-rise redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of "urban farmers," many of whom tend nothing more than small 
vegetable patches or rice paddies, are exempt from property taxes if they 
declare their intention to farm for 10 years. Banks offer 100-year mortgages. 
Current landholding taxes are only as high as 0.2%, allowing small owners to 
sit tight and watch values spiral upward. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, real estate experts say, the main reason for the land inflation is 
probably not a lack of space but simply that so little is traded. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are also moving slowly for Shiodome, a remnant of the government's 1987 
selloff of the state-owned railway to private companies. 
</P>
<P>
Yoneda of the Transportation Ministry, who is charged with developing a 
subdivision plan, said the rail yard is to be gradually sold off for commercial 
use after March, 1992. But that timetable may be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"It is extraordinary. If they had disposed of Shiodome several years ago, that 
land would have soaked up so much speculative money," said Gregory Clark, a 
Sophia University economics professor who has advised the government on the 
land problem. 
</P>
<P>
"They genuinely believe that by keeping a supply of land off the market they 
lower prices," Clark said. "If you look at the situation with Western eyes 
you'd have to assume it was a government plot" to keep prices high. 
</P>
<P>
Some Westerners do. An article in the October issue of the Atlantic Monthly, 
for example, accuses Japan's government of "a conscious and even a brilliant 
strategy" to maintain sky-high land prices as a means of keeping foreign 
companies from buying into Japan, suppressing consumption of foreign goods and 
boosting savings. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts conclude, however, that there is no evidence of such a scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Makoto Utsumi, vice minister of finance for international affairs, looked 
surprised when asked whether his ministry was behind it all, as some conspiracy 
theorists contend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally wrong to think that Finance Ministry officials are happy to see 
higher land prices," he said. Indeed, the ministry has been urging banks to 
rein in real estate loans, but to little avail. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he would "never rule out a plot entirely, because there are depths 
of this society we never get to." 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a plot," he said, "they're very clever. If not, they're very stupid. 
And I can't believe the Japanese are so stupid."

CATS HAVE RAVE REACTIONS TO VIDEO OF CAVORTING BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT M. ANDREWS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HERNDON, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Malarkey was a disgruntled computer technician looking for a career 
change when his cat leaped forward with an idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting in front of the TV with my wife, watching a National Geographic 
special on birds of the Cayman Islands or somewhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our cat, Stick, who never even glanced at TV before, came out of his box like 
a shot and sat right in front of the screen, growling and meowing." 
</P>
<P>
Malarkey borrowed a friend's video camera and tripod, scattered birdseed and 
popcorn in his wooded back yard and recorded the antics of neighborhood birds, 
squirrels and chipmunks that gathered for a noisy feast. 
</P>
<P>
"When I brought the tape back to the house and showed it to Stick, he went 
ballistic," Malarkey said. "He was in front of the TV, behind the TV, on top of 
the TV, knocking things over and swiping at the screen." 
</P>
<P>
Nice kitty. 
</P>
<P>
Malarkey went into the "cat business" in a big way. His "Video Catnip," a 
professional, 25-minute version of the same back yard scene, is one of the 
hottest gift items to appear on pet store shelves this Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
Malarkey says he's sold 7,000 copies since his video hit the market in 
September, 1989, most of them in the last couple of months. Fewer than 10 tapes 
have been returned on behalf of dissatisfied feline viewers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Human viewers might find "Video Catnip" boring after a while. There's just so 
much excitement in watching a pair of blue jays squabbling or a squirrel 
snitching a peanut from a bowl. 
</P>
<P>
But Malarkey, who recently moved from this Washington suburb to Morgantown, 
W.Va., says it's the purr-fect stocking stuffer for the indoor cat who has 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
"Steven Spielberg it ain't," he said, "but we haven't gotten any complaints yet 
from the cats." 
</P>
<P>
The tape, which retails for $19.95, promises "some cat-a-clysmic fun with no 
paws in the action." It starts with this warning: 
</P>
<P>
"While watching this video, your cat may become excited and attempt to get 
inside your television set to get at the birds. . . . We strongly suggest that 
you remove all breakables from on top or around your TV set. No kitting." 
</P>
<P>
The live action is divided into segments titled "Cheep Thrills," "Mews and 
Feather Report" and "A Stalk in the Park," which features plenty of close-up 
shots of kitty's favorite creatures cavorting on the TV screen. 
</P>
<P>
Can cats really "see" a TV video? 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians agree with Malarkey that although cats don't discern shapes and 
colors as distinctly as humans, they are acutely aware of moving figures and 
sounds that excite them.

USED CARS LURE SAUDIS TO BUSTLING DESERT SWAP MEET 
</P>

DAMMAM, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Evening in this strategically located oil boom town brings the final call to 
prayer at the mosque and then, like a siren's song across the windblown sand, 
the irresistible call of the road. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 U.S. and foreign soldiers are hunkered down in the desert 
only a few hours away, facing Iraqi guns and protecting Saudi Arabia's oil 
fields. But here in the capital of the country's eastern province, young Saudi 
men have something quite different on their minds: the pursuit and enjoyment of 
the air-conditioned automobile. 
</P>
<P>
On a sandy field, just off the road leading to the air base where arriving 
American troops march off transport planes, thousands of Saudis in identical 
long, white robes gather daily for a giant car swap meet. Hundreds more cruise 
the waterfront in nearby Dhahran, maneuvering for a place in the crowded 
parking lots where they spread carpets on the oil-soaked gravel, lean against 
their cars and sip sweet tea in the moonlight. 
</P>
<P>
"I come as soon as I finish work," said Takhir, a manager at Saudi Arabian 
Airlines who lounged on the hood of his sleek, black Park Avenue sedan at the 
used-car fairgrounds. "It's for enjoyment." He has been trying, in a relaxed 
way, to sell the 1983 car for a year. In the meantime, he has bought and sold 
10 other cars at Dammam's auto exposition -- just for the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the exhaust fumes of idling cars, the possibility of a shooting war in the 
Persian Gulf, the demands by Saudi women for the freedom to drive and other 
burning issues of the day fade beside more traditional concerns. 
</P>
<P>
In this resolutely all-male setting, the rituals of barter and trade, or the 
timing of an offer of tea or cardamom-laced coffee, take precedence. 
</P>
<P>
And the car, more often than not a big American model or a top-of-the-line 
Mercedes-Benz, is both the instrument and object of social discourse. 
</P>
<P>
Some men come to sell their cars, driving slowly around the sprawling 
exhibition grounds to display their wares and evaluate the competition. Some 
come to buy, shuffling along the cigarette-strewn sand to peer under hoods and 
shout questions at the drivers cruising by. And some come just for the 
sociability of it all, strolling arm in arm with their friends and munching 
from small plastic dishes of chickpeas served out of big kettles. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, we used to use camels. Now we use cars," said Mohammed Mijnad al 
Shamry, one of the few dealers who sells cars in bulk, underneath a hangar at 
the swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
"Our forefathers were proud of their camels because they provided meat and milk 
as well as transportation," he said, toying with a string of worry beads as he 
wrapped up his latest sale over coffee on a carpeted, outdoor platform. "Our 
former king, Abdul Aziz, unified the whole kingdom by camel. He got rid of the 
imperialists by camel. And we are ready to go back to the camel if we must." 
</P>
<P>
Such a calamity is unlikely. Gasoline is still about 56 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Most middle-class and wealthy Saudi families proudly maintain a stable of 
automobiles, much as their forefathers kept herds of camels. 
</P>
<P>
Al Shamry's father was a camel herder, and the son, now 55, still keeps 50 of 
the animals, along with 120 cars at his dealership and a car for each of his 
own 12 sons. 
</P>
<P>
"Cars are cheap these days in Saudi Arabia," he said. "This is the act of God 
and of King Fahd, the custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. Everything is cheap in 
this country." 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling car lot, like a small-town country fair, offers a variety of 
commodities, attracting more Saudis to one place than just about any other 
activity. A man in a stained robe offers a pair of hooded falcons for $900 from 
the back of his Chevrolet pickup truck, where he also displays the stuffed 
heads of a fox and small leopard. Next to him, a man sells miswak sticks, 
gnarled, fibrous branches used as natural toothbrushes, from the trunk of his 
new Toyota Cressida. 
</P>
<P>
The gulf crisis doesn't intrude. Business is as good as it was before the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait triggered a massive buildup of foreign troops in Saudi 
Arabia, car dealer Al Shamry said. As for the U.S. troops stationed nearby, his 
only opinion is that "America is a friend for us, not an enemy." 
</P>
<P>
If the king demanded it, he added, "we are all ready to defend our country." 
But for the moment "it doesn't concern me," Al Shamry said. "I just deal with 
my business."

VETERAN PILOT FIGHTS FAA IN EFFORT TO STAY IN THE AIR

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Watts has flown military cargo planes to China and an orchestra to Canada. 
He's survived an emergency landing in Bismarck and an unexpected plunge into 
the Missouri River. 
</P>
<P>
He's ornery or kind, depending on whom you talk to. 
</P>
<P>
Watts, 73, owns Capital Aviation, with 10 small airplanes, and runs it with his 
wife, Lois. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not in the air, you can find Watts in his shop, rebuilding a 1946 
Cessna, along with his family -- Lois, their 15-year-old dog Klondike and two 
cats. 
</P>
<P>
Klondike has logged more than 3,000 miles in the air. The cats, Midway and 
Nuisance, have made a few flights by sneaking on board. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll bet I've got shirts and socks in at least a dozen Laundromats all over 
the country from living out of a briefcase," he said. But he's had fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want an airline job where I have to fly to Minneapolis to Bismarck 
and back to Minneapolis and back to Bismarck. I wouldn't do that for all the 
tea in China," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Watts was in China during World War II, airlifting military supplies over "The 
Hump," in the Himalaya Mountains to the Flying Tigers, a group of mercenaries 
under the command of the Allies. 
</P>
<P>
"We hauled tent stakes, ketchup, light bulbs, munitions. We moved two cut-up 
locomotives over the Hump. Later, they were welded back together." 
</P>
<P>
After the war, he and his brother, Jack, started Capital Aviation Corp. Jack 
Watts retired eight years ago. Lois Watts, a home economics teacher for 29 
years, became office manager and bookkeeper in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
When conductor Guy Lombardo and his orchestra found their plane had engine 
trouble, Watts got them to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Watts was piloting a plane carrying eight people when the landing gear 
failed and he was forced to bring the plane down in Bismarck on its belly. The 
landing was smooth; no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, he and a photographer escaped injury when their light plane went into 
the Missouri River. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't watching where I was going," Watts recalled. "I just flew the plane 
into the water -- just like the guy on the street, turns his head to look at a 
pretty girl and hits a lamppost. I learned to mind the road." 
</P>
<P>
His biggest obstacle, he says, is the Federal Aviation Administration, which is 
threatening to take away his license for flying without the proper fuel 
adjustment valve. Watts and his attorney are fighting the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't dot all your i's and cross your t's, you are subject to severe 
penalties and fines," Watts said. "People in Washington seem to think a light 
plane is a rich man's fancy." 
</P>
<P>
But people like Erwin Kobs of Bismarck, who did maintenance for Watts in the 
1950s, think he'll outlast the bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tough master, but he's a good pilot," Kobs said. "Aviation is his life, 
there's no doubt about that. He's a survivor."

DEATH ENDS MILLIONAIRE'S SEARCH FOR KIDNAPED WIFE

Robert Hearin paid almost $1 million trying to pay ransom for his wife of 50 
years, but her kidnapers were unyielding and the 73-year-old multimillionaire 
died without seeing her again. 
</P>
<P>
Hearin's heart gave out in November, two years after Annie Laurie Hearin was 
taken from their Mississippi home. 
</P>
<P>
Hearin, one of the most powerful and wealthiest men in Mississippi, paid 
$931,000 in ransom, but his wife was never freed and authorities believe she is 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
"My one regret is I couldn't give him back his wife," FBI agent Wayne R. Taylor 
said. "We continue to do everything we can that might lead to her." 
</P>
<P>
The Hearins met as students at the University of Alabama and were married in 
1940. They had two children, Robert Hearin Jr., a lawyer in New Orleans, and 
Laurie McRee of Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a terrible loss. I think, all along, there has been a real mix of 
sadness and anger," said the son. 
</P>
<P>
Hearin's worth was estimated at $200 million. He controlled Mississippi's 
largest gas distribution company, Mississippi Valley Gas Co., its 
second-largest bank, Trustmark National Bank, and its second-largest insurance 
company, Lamar Life Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Hearin avoided the news media after his wife was kidnaped, but did appear on 
the TV show "Unsolved Mysteries." He never gave up hope of finding his wife, 
although authorities believe she died long ago. Last year, he moved out of the 
brick house they had shared. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty sure she was dead within the first month. I am absolutely sure she 
is dead," said Dr. Rodrigo Galvez, a Jackson psychiatrist and pathologist who 
analyzed the ransom note. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Hearin, who was 72 when she was kidnaped, suffered from ileitis, a chronic 
intestinal disease that can cause death in days without daily medication. 
</P>
<P>
About three weeks after she was kidnaped, her husband received a letter in her 
handwriting. It urged him to pay off 12 disgruntled investors who were named in 
a rambling letter left in the house the day she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials said that Hearin paid a total of $931,000 to investors in a 
school picture company of which he was the largest shareholder. Among them was 
Newton Alfred Winn, a St. Petersburg, Fla., lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Winn was sentenced in February to 19 years in prison for conspiracy to kidnap, 
mailing a threatening communication and lying to a federal grand jury. No one 
was ever charged with the actual kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Hearin said that he and his sister still hope their mother will 
return, but "the passage of time leads one not to be optimistic."

TODDLER'S RESCUER DOESN'T SEE SELF AS HERO

Larry Ogletree doesn't think of himself as a hero. 
</P>
<P>
The Evans, Ga., man said he was just doing what he hopes anyone would do when 
he chased a runaway car, dodged traffic and stopped an oncoming 18-wheeler to 
rescue a 2-year-old boy inside the car. 
</P>
<P>
"If one of my sons were in a life-threatening situation, whether it be that or 
anything, I would want somebody to do the same thing," said Ogletree, general 
manager for the American National Insurance Cos. office in Augusta and the 
father of three boys, ages 12, 7 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
Ogletree, 40, had just turned onto a busy five-lane highway in suburban 
Martinez on his way to work Aug. 8, 1989, when he spotted the silver compact 
car rolling out of a convenience store parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It just didn't look normal," he said. "There was something wrong. The wheels 
weren't turning or anything. Then I saw the child's head in the back of the 
car." 
</P>
<P>
He also saw a woman, later identified as the child's mother, standing in the 
parking lot screaming. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, I knew what was happening," Ogletree said. 
</P>
<P>
He jumped the median in his own car and parked, then began chasing the runaway 
car, which was traveling diagonally across traffic headed into the path of the 
oncoming tractor-trailer rig. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up at the 18-wheeler," Ogletree said. "His and my eyes met. He just 
understood and he, of course, applied his brakes. He was about 10 feet from the 
car. I was running the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
Ogletree finally got close enough to grab the driver's side of the car, which 
was open. "I threw myself into it. I had ahold of the steering wheel and 
applied the brakes. The child was calm until I hit the brakes. Then he started 
crying. He was in a safety seat." 
</P>
<P>
Ogletree, who escaped with only scarred shins, said he believes the boy's 
sister accidentally hit the gearshift when she got out of the car, allowing the 
car to roll. 
</P>
<P>
The mother thanked him but implored him not to release her name or the names of 
her children, a request that he has honored. 
</P>
<P>
Ogletree said he didn't fully grasp what might have happened until that night, 
when he went to pick up his two younger boys at a day-care center adjacent to 
the convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that at that point it kind of came over me I might not have been there 
to pick them up. It was very emotional," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Spears, an insurance agent in a competing firm, has known Ogletree more 
than 10 years and said he wasn't surprised by his actions. 
</P>
<P>
"He's that kind of a fellow," Spears said. "He is not one that sits on the 
sidelines. He is a doer, a mover, a shaker. If you go into a fight, you want 
him to be behind you." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us were prepared for the fact that someone would have the 
courage to do what he did," said Carol Shearer, a volunteer at the Columbia 
County Humane Society.

CHEWING KHAT A COMMON BOND IN YEMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM DROZDIAK, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANAA, Yemen 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Down a dusty alley of the old city's ramshackle bazaar, behind huge mounds of 
sultanas, coffee and spices that have been marketed here for more than three 
millennia, a young vendor named Ahmed invited a curious visitor to join him and 
his neighbors in an afternoon ritual enigmatically described as the key to 
Yemeni democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The men stretched languidly on mats spread around the floor and began munching 
green leaves plucked from bundles of small branches. Each of them would slowly 
build up a wad of moist leaves in his cheek, sucking the juice through the 
mucous membranes. The bitter, astringent taste was soon forgotten as 
conversation became more animated, ranging over diverse issues such as bread 
and fuel prices, the revolutionary changes in the role of women, Iraq's 
President Saddam Hussein and the risks of war in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Each afternoon, life in Yemen comes to a virtual standstill for three or four 
hours as this scene unfolds in countless shops and salons around the country. 
Chewing khat (pronounced "gut") -- the mildly narcotic leaf that packs a 
stimulant punch equal to a double espresso -- is more than the national 
pastime. It functions as a basic forum of social intercourse where business 
deals are consummated, marriages are brokered and political bonds are sealed. 
In Western terms, the khat chew fulfills all of the purposes served by the 
power lunch, the kaffeeklatsch and the cocktail hour. 
</P>
<P>
In this rugged land of almost incessant tribal warfare, the khat chew helps 
hold a violent society together. Blood feuds -- perpetuated when assassinations 
are habitually revenged by killing kinsmen of the murderer -- are rarely 
settled unless money changes hands and khat is chewed. 
</P>
<P>
In a country where most men proudly flaunt curved daggers in their belts or 
Kalashnikov assault rifles on their shoulders, the bitter green leaf's 
universal popularity represents a unique common bond, helping sustain tenuous 
truces that have preoccupied President Ali Abdullah Saleh during much of his 12 
years in power. 
</P>
<P>
When North and South Yemen merged into one nation last May, Saleh vowed to 
promote a democratic society through free speech and free elections. Successful 
experiments in democracy are rare in the Arab world, but Yemeni officials 
believe that their effort will be aided by the national habit of munching those 
green leaves. 
</P>
<P>
"The khat chew, in a way, is like a little parliament," explained Abdel Malik 
Sindi, an Information Ministry official. "You can find government ministers 
sitting together with laborers, discussing big problems and small, irrespective 
of social status. Besides, many poorer people usually know where to find the 
best khat." 
</P>
<P>
In some households more than half the monthly income is spent on khat. Children 
have been known to go hungry so a father can maintain respect and admiration 
among his peers by sharing the finest-quality khat at an afternoon chew. As a 
luxury crop, khat has acquired not only high economic value but great social 
prestige for its cultivators. 
</P>
<P>
Production has more than doubled in the last two decades, displacing grain and 
the famed Mocha coffee because of its lucrative value. 
</P>
<P>
Khat connoisseurs estimate that there are 80 varieties, with different tastes, 
strengths and sensations. "It can be as complex as wine, and people will go to 
great lengths to find choice branches from a particular part of the valley," 
said Eric Watkins, a British journalist and academic researcher based in Sanaa 
who has traveled widely throughout Yemen sampling different kinds of khat. 
</P>
<P>
Some Yemenis swear that khat has important medicinal value, particularly in 
controlling diabetes. A popular rumor among returning Yemeni laborers who 
worked for years in neighboring Saudi Arabia is that the portly King Fahd has 
taken up khat chewing to control diabetes, curb his appetite and reduce his 
weight. But doctors in Yemen warn that too much consumption can cause heart 
palpitations and, ultimately, cancer of the esophagus if wads of khat are 
swallowed too frequently.

FUTURE SPARKLES IN RESURGENT CLEVELAND

<P>
In Tower City, the centerpiece of this city's downtown renaissance, visitors 
pass by fountains and boutiques to consider an exhibit made of cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
They're looking at a model of downtown Cleveland in the year 2000, a remarkable 
tangle of hotels, parks, public works and stunning architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the vision could prove to be fantasy. But judging from the cranes 
towering over the United States' 12th-largest metropolitan area, much of the 
construction is already under way. From the shores of Lake Erie to the city's 
Public Square, Cleveland is welding and riveting its way into the next century. 
As the United States slips toward recession, this gritty Rust Belt survivor 
actually suffers from a shortage of construction workers. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the activity is Clevelanders' willingness to spend money, bury their 
differences and unite around common goals. The city's experience provides a 
good lesson for other major cities facing hard times. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere are the results more evident than downtown, where builders are trying 
to catch up on decades of pent-up demand. Until recently, Cleveland was a time 
capsule that preserved old structures because nothing was built to replace 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's problems were numerous, including a crisis of confidence caused by 
burning ghettos, bumbling mayors, a river that caught fire and the collapse of 
its steel, automobile and machine-tool industries. When Cleveland defaulted on 
its bond obligations in 1978, it looked as if the city might never recover. 
</P>
<P>
But it fought back. Mayor George Voinovich, now governor-elect of Ohio, helped 
reverse the decline by getting business, political and community leaders to 
agree on what needed to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"When you had the economic problems we had in the early 1980s, you really 
didn't have much choice," said Richard Shatten, executive vice president of 
Cleveland Tomorrow, an economic development group made up of chief executives 
from Cleveland's 50 largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
What followed was a combination of private and public efforts that reshaped the 
skyline and fostered employment. One example: A tax abatement to get LTV Steel 
to invest an additional $1 billion in the area. The effort preserved 6,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Albert Ratner, a Clevelander whose projects include the 16-acre 
MetroTech development in Brooklyn, N.Y., chipped in by taking on the Terminal 
Tower, the Depression-era skyscraper that dominates the skyline. He converted 
the old railroad station at the base of the tower into a splashy development 
with a Ritz-Carlton hotel and three levels of shopping. 
</P>
<P>
Tower City is only the latest in a series of projects. On the opposite side of 
Public Square, an office tower being built has surpassed the Terminal Tower as 
the city's tallest structure. When completed next fall, the 948-foot bank 
headquarters will be the tallest building between New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the $344 million Gateway sports complex, a massive project that is 
getting started on the edge of downtown. In an age of public financing of 
sports facilities, the project -- which includes a stadium for the Indians 
baseball team and an arena for the Cavaliers basketball team -- stands out 
because of the role played by private investors. 
</P>
<P>
Voters approved a tax on liquor and tobacco to pay half the cost and private 
investors agreed to pay the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just fantastic what they've done to this city in recent years," said Bill 
Carroll, a public affairs manager of Ford Motor Co., the city's largest private 
employer, with 17,000 workers. Ford is investing $2 billion in its 
Cleveland-area factories. 
</P>
<P>
But Cleveland still has serious problems. The city's schools are considered 
weak, and old-line manufacturers routinely close plants. Cleveland's growth 
still lags behind its rivals, Columbus and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in a city where one can buy a four-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of 
Shaker Heights for $129,900, Cleveland has an appeal that should help it over 
the humps.

A TRUE-BLUE TEST FOR LOBSTER EATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WALPOLE, Me.

<TEXT>
<P>
Every year, a few lobstermen find a freak when they haul in their traps -- a 
lobster with a shell as blue as the Maine sky. 
</P>
<P>
And they'll often call Sam Chapman, the godfather of blue lobsters in Maine. He 
has about 400, ranging in hue from powder blue to electric cobalt blue to "a 
blue so dark it's almost black." 
</P>
<P>
Most lobsters plucked from the Atlantic's icy waters are a mottled mixture of 
green, red and brown. They turn bright red when they're cooked. 
</P>
<P>
Blue lobsters are genetic mutations in which the crustacean's blue gene is 
dominant. About one in every 3 million or 4 million lobsters caught along the 
Maine coast is blue, Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Lobsters have genes for the production of red, yellow and blue," said Chapman, 
an aquaculture specialist at the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center. 
"If the gene for red and the gene for yellow aren't functioning, you get a blue 
lobster." 
</P>
<P>
The disorder also produces lobsters with yellow shells, red shells and even 
yellow with black spots, known as calico lobsters. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman has been raising blue lobsters since 1982 in a study to determine if 
Maine's fishing grounds can be restocked with lobsters raised in hatcheries. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcheries have operated in Maine off and on for decades. But Chapman said no 
one has ever proved that restocking coastal waters increases the number of 
lobsters in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that hatchery-raised lobsters are released when they are 
the size of a thumbnail and hard to tag for later identification. 
</P>
<P>
So with the blue lobster, Chapman said, "what you have is essentially a colored 
tag." 
</P>
<P>
"You can do all of the plot sampling and research that you want, but the proof 
of the pudding in this whole program is how many blue lobsters show up in 
traps" over the next five years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It took from 1982 -- when he collected Amanda and Vinnie, the first two blues 
he bred -- until the summer of 1988 to raise enough blue lobsters to get 
started. 
</P>
<P>
In June and July 1988, Chapman and another University of Maine researcher 
released 5,600 blue lobsters off Boothbay Harbor. In 1989, they sampled the 
area and found two blues. But sampling this past summer turned up none. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman released 1,100 blue lobsters in Pemaquid Harbor this past summer and 
1,500 in Cutler Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks the latest restocking will be easier to monitor because Pemaquid and 
Cutler are sheltered harbors. "My feeling is somewhere between three and four 
years after you let them go, they'll start showing up in traps," Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
He also has kept about 375 blue lobsters for behavior testing. They are living 
in rows of cages in his laboratory, each 2 years old, 3 to 4 inches long and 
bright blue. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chapman has older, larger blues that have been donated over the 
years by lobstermen. He fetched two for a photographer -- a 1 3/8 pounder that 
is 8 years old and a 2 1/2 pounder that is about 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"An obvious question is do blue lobsters survive at the same rate as regular 
lobsters do? What we need to know is, do they behave the same when they're 
introduced to the ocean bottom?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
To answer those questions, he has begun studies to see how blue lobsters behave 
when introduced to different environments with and without the presence of 
predators. 
</P>
<P>
David Dow, a former lobsterman and executive director of the Maine Lobster 
Institute at the University of Maine, thinks Chapman's work could be important 
for the future of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how long our production is going to last," he said. "Ten years 
down the road, we might not have as large a supply. Or 10 years down the road, 
if we do our homework and expand our markets, we might want to increase our 
supply." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony D'Agostino, director of the Montauk Marine Science Institute on Long 
Island, said Chapman's project seemed "worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
"I just wonder if he has enough funding to do it properly," said D'Agostino, 
who has been studying lobsters since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's funding is slight -- he started with $7,000 from the Lobster Advisory 
Council and has kept going with a yearly stipend of about $600 from the Maine 
Lobstermen's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
For all Chapman's work, however, he can't answer the key question on every 
lobster-lover's mind -- do blues taste the same? 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone asks that question," Chapman said. "The problem is we've never had 
enough to be able to eat any. So I don't know. I've never eaten a blue 
lobster."

</P>
<P>
SHOPPING: THEY HANG OUT AMID THE STORES, BLOCKING ENTRANCES AND INTIMIDATING 
CUSTOMERS. WHEN BANNING THE YOUTHS DID NOT WORK, MERCHANTS TRIED GETTING THEM

<P>
With Christmas shoppers breathing down their necks, the people who run the 
nation's almost 35,000 shopping centers have an eye out these days for the 
droves of teen-agers whose high jinks sometimes explode in violence and whose 
presence sometimes intimidates other shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen shopping centers and malls have gone so far as to ban teen-agers 
entirely at critical hours. 
</P>
<P>
And even those that haven't are looking for ways to cope with youngsters who 
have adopted the comfortable and elegant mall surroundings as second homes. 
</P>
<P>
At its fall meeting in Kansas City, the International Council of Shopping 
Centers held a seminar titled "Hanging Out: Whose Shopping Mall Is It Anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
At McKinley Mall in Hamburg, N.Y., 15 miles from Buffalo, no one under 20 is 
allowed inside between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, unless they 
are reporting for work or are accompanied by an adult. 
</P>
<P>
The mall took the action after an estimated 600 teens inundated the mall's food 
court one Friday night and a fight in the parking lot spilled over into the 
common area. 
</P>
<P>
At the Randall Park Mall in North Randall, Ohio, the operators don't allow 
unescorted teens at any hour. Even teen-agers going to the theater must be 
brought and picked up. 
</P>
<P>
Omaha's Park Fair has banned people under 18. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond those shopping centers that have banned teens, far more have reported 
trouble controlling teen crowds that clog common areas, block store entrances 
and generally, if inadvertently, intimidate customers. 
</P>
<P>
But banning teens has also posed an ironic conflict. Teens are good customers. 
They spend a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
Mall operators say the problems stem from changes in the community, a growing 
number of two-income latchkey families and the cuts made in school budgets, 
leaving the teens no place to go when the closing bell rings. They are a new 
kind of temporarily homeless, and the mall is a haven. 
</P>
<P>
The scene at Aurora Mall, outside Denver, Colo., this Christmas season is a 
study in contrast to a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
This year there are teen-age advisory boards at all eight high schools in the 
mall's neighborhood, and each of these sends a representative to a super 
advisory board that meets once a month at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
These youngsters, with adult advisers drawn from the community, help devise 
programs that can help revise adult perceptions about teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
So this Christmas they will field Customer Service Ambassadors, drawn from the 
high schools, who will help adult customers with their parcels, with directions 
to shops, and try to change adult attitudes to the teen-age presence. There 
will also be teen-agers available at the mall to wrap Christmas presents for 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Consider last year. Mall operators began to notice a growing number of 
youngsters in the spring of 1989. Susan Keene, general manager, says they were 
congregating in large groups, "acting out in loud fashion" and otherwise 
horsing around. "We started receiving complaints from our adult shoppers" on 
Mondays following the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"So in order to get rid of the problem and get rid of it fast, we instituted a 
get-tough policy in the fall of 1989. It was a kind of steamroller approach." 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters were handed wallet-sized cards with rules of behavior on them -- no 
behavior likely to cause a disturbance, no sitting on planter walls, no 
alcoholic beverages, no blocking store entrances. After two weeks notice, they 
were given one warning and then photographed and banned. Recalcitrants were 
arrested by local police and charged with trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
The mall was banning 10 to 15 youngsters every Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't work. There was no decrease in teen-agers coming to the mall. 
Harassment was not the answer. Furthermore, the mall became the target of a 
boycott and pickets from the black community, which perceived the tactic as 
being aimed at their children. 
</P>
<P>
"While only about 20% of Aurora Mall shoppers were African-American," says 
manager Keene, "about 75% of the kids who come to the mall are 
African-American." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly something else had to be done. The mall began with a marketing survey, 
intercepting youngsters and holding discussion groups to find out just who they 
were. What they found was something of a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
The teens and their parents, they discovered, had a sense of ownership of the 
mall, even though it was private property. They felt it was their right to 
congregate there, not just to shop. The youngsters came to be with their 
friends, to make dates, to find out where the parties were, all of this in lieu 
of a school environment that had suffered from budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The mall offered an elegant and inexpensive focus for the youngsters, and in 
some cases a place they perceived as being safer than their own neighborhoods. 
The youngsters, concerned about gang activity in the community, saw the mall as 
safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Huber of a Cleveland firm that manages a number of malls says that on 
one occasion three teen gang members were standing at an entrance to the mall 
when four members of a rival gang drove by. The four turned the car around, got 
a running start, jumped the curb and crashed into the entrance in an attempt to 
run down their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, gang activity is easier to deal with than the teen problem, shopping 
center operators say, because the police know who they are and what to do about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Not so the average teen-agers. The market survey showed that the teens visited 
the Aurora Mall one to three times a week, visited an average of 10 stores and 
spent an average of $64 a visit. Most of them had sincere career aspirations, 
and in spite of their bizarre dress and behavior were basically "good kids." 
</P>
<P>
So the mall operators set about changing their own mind-set, and that of 
security people. Just because kids had intimidating appearances and numbers, it 
didn't mean they were bad or that they were any more bizarre than previous 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
The mall also hired a customer service director whose job is more public 
relations than security, which also comes under his purview. The accent is on 
politeness, requests to move on, or please don't block the store front. It 
seems to be working. 
</P>
<P>
And the city of Aurora put a highly visible police mini-station in the heart of 
the mall. 
</P>
<P>
There was a similar impasse at the Columbia Mall in Columbia, S.C., where a 
heavy-handed approach eventually yielded to gentler means. Without knowing it, 
the mall operator had used a strong but old South Carolina law that permits the 
banning of people from private property for six months under penalty of law. 
</P>
<P>
They used the law frequently, but then discovered it had been passed as a tool 
for segregationists. There was a community uproar. 
</P>
<P>
Now the mall has a polite Customer Service Corps, neatly dressed people in 
blazers and carrying radios and directories of stores. They help customers with 
parcels, give directions and act as new sets of eyes and ears as they roam 
around the mall. 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of the mall as a prime community focal point has been growing 
throughout the nation each year. The number of malls and floor space has been 
growing about 7% a year, drawing 172.4 million adults, 70% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
Malls and shopping centers now number 34,683, and more than 1,500 new ones were 
started in 1989. One near Minneapolis plans to house about 600 stores. 
</P>
<P>
So the teen problem can be expected to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Most expect the banning of teen-agers to abate, however. Teen-agers are a

REPORT CARD EXPLAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent editorials have left an impression that the Sierra Club's evaluation of 
the San Diego City Council's voting record on environmental issues is somehow 
flawed. Let's consider some of the concerns that have been expressed. 
</P>
<P>
Why do public interest groups, such as the Sierra Club, even produce such 
report cards? 
</P>
<P>
One of the important functions of these watchdog groups is to determine the 
voting records of politicians and to share that information with interested 
citizens. Every member of the council claims to be environmentally sensitive; 
yet historically, neither the public nor the media had the statistics to 
explore or challenge their proclamations. For this reason, the San Diego 
Chapter of the Sierra Club has devoted significant resources to report card 
efforts over the past three years. Its reports have been praised for their 
thoroughness and have served as models for other groups throughout the nation. 
What types of issues were included in the report and why were they chosen? The 
votes in the current report cover a broad range of topics, including growth 
management, sensitive lands protection, recycling, parks, water and air 
quality, sewage, toxic wastes, housing, transportation and open space 
preservation. The report spells out how the defeat of a project to fill a 
Normal Heights Canyon with housing protected our city's open spaces and who 
voted to protect us. It provides details about the votes on many other 
important issues. 
</P>
<P>
The members of the council cast the votes on these environmental issues. The 
report card only tallied them and explained why they were important. The club 
hopes that members of our community will find this information useful. 
</P>
<P>
Why was the August cutoff date used and why was the score card published at 
this time? 
</P>
<P>
The City Council takes a recess in August. It therefore attempts to wrap up 
business in anticipation of their vacations. So August provides a fair break 
point. Reviewing public documents, summarizing actions and preparing the 
analysis is a time-consuming process. In fact, the task took Sierra Club staff 
and volunteers 2 1/2 months. It was also timed to remind council members that 
they will be watched as they vote on protecting the urban reserve, preventing 
the division of Mission Trails Regional Park by a major expressway and 
preserving our sensitive lands through a resource protection ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Why was an absence factor included in the overall score? 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Sierra Club was criticized because some members of the council 
obtained high environmental ratings by missing many important votes. It is not 
right to let our decision makers duck taking stands. Therefore absences were 
handled in this years report by counting each missed roll call as half a wrong 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
What are the Sierra Club's plans for future reports? 
</P>
<P>
Recent council actions makes it clear that there is a need for more focus on 
the details in a few of the more important decisions. The current rating system 
does not give more weight to important votes, such as protecting a park from 
Jackson Drive, than to votes on standard Earth Day proclamations. The club will 
seek advise on how to best deal with this in future report cards. It plans to 
continue to publish the information needed to help San Diegans challenge their 
elected officials to make environmentally sound decisions. Look for the Sierra 
Club's report on the Board of Supervisors in a few more months.

JACKSON DRIVE EXTENSION PRO, CON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council approved the extension of Jackson Drive on Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
By acting with unnecessary (and uncharacteristic) haste, it would appear that 
they have now compounded their assault on the taxpayer's pocketbook by placing 
the city in an extremely awkward legal position. 
</P>
<P>
Because the environmental impact report recommended against construction of the 
extension, the council was legally required (under California law) to construct 
the environmentally preferred alternative road -- or to construct no road at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
In order to approve the road, the council had to find that there are overriding 
social or economic considerations. 
</P>
<P>
There were essentially two overriding consideration adopted: 
</P>
<P>
1) The road is required for reduction of traffic on Mission Gorge Road. 
</P>
<P>
2) The road is necessary for park access. 
</P>
<P>
To adopt these considerations, they had to find that there are no other 
feasible alternatives. There came the rub. 
</P>
<P>
Questions by Bruce Henderson, Ron Roberts and Wes Pratt conclusively revealed 
that alternative Park access had never been analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Roberts specifically asked city staff about alternatives and was told that 
none had been considered because it was always assumed that Jackson Drive would 
be built. 
</P>
<P>
So now the council is on record as having found (in the legal sense) that the 
road is necessary for park access and the staff are on record admitting that 
they haven't considered alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Good job, guys . . . the environmental attorneys are already circling overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Had this been any other project, there would have been a "time out." 
</P>
<P>
Any other project would have been sent back to staff for an analysis of 
alternatives. Not this project, though. Councilwoman Judy McCarty was in too 
much of a hurry to admit that more information was warranted. 
</P>
<P>
So now the city is going to be on the losing end of a legal battle that will 
cost us all a bundle. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bruce Henderson concocted a few alternatives right in plain view of 
everyone -- some of them warranted consideration. 
</P>
<P>
He's a lot more creative than the city staff. Why didn't he stick to his guns 
and send this back for further work? 
</P>
<P>
It's not too late. The issue can be reconsidered. Staff should be told to 
identify and evaluate alternative park access. 
</P>
<P>
The public should have an opportunity to review the staff's work, then a 
decision should be made. 
</P>
<P>
One of Bruce Henderson's finer qualities is that he's tight with the taxpayer's 
buck. We like that. 
</P>
<P>
Surely he's not going to continue to be the vote that causes the city to spend 
$80 million without all of the information. 
</P>
<P>
I call on Bruce Henderson, as taxpayer advocate, to request reconsideration.

CRITICAL LOOK AT NEW READING PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: NEW WHOLE-LANGUAGE APPROACH TO TEACHING READING MAY BE A PRELUDE TO 
FUTURE PROBLEMS FOR PUPILS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GROFF, Patrick Groff is a professor of education at San Diego State 
University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sharp-eyed readers of the recent California Assessment Program scores may have 
noticed that the third-grade children in San Diego usually scored higher in 
reading than the sixth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 80 elementary schools tested in the San Diego Unified School District, 
in only 16, or 20%, did sixth-graders score as high or higher than the 
third-graders. 
</P>
<P>
The foremost reason for this poorer performance by sixth-graders, according to 
the state Department of Education, is that the tests for sixth-graders contain 
about 40% more critical-reading items. These questions require the student to 
make inferences about what they read. 
</P>
<P>
What this would seem to signify is that San Diego sixth-graders have received 
less than the ideal instruction in how to read critically. CAP expects teachers 
to develop more critical-reading ability in their sixth-grade pupils than they 
actually do. 
</P>
<P>
Critical reading is certainly more difficult than reading literally. 
</P>
<P>
In literal reading, the goal is to comprehend precisely what an author 
intended. Critical reading, on the other hand, requires the student to evaluate 
the ideas -- to decide whether they are accurate, honorable, relevant, 
complete, up-to-date, metaphoric or symbolic, accompanied by supporting 
evidence, or whether they meet a host of other criteria. 
</P>
<P>
But, although critical reading is more complicated than literal reading, its 
success depends on good literal-reading skills. Only after literal knowledge is 
obtained, can critical reading commence. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego city schools and many others around the state have recently 
adopted a new way to teach reading: the so-called whole-language approach. 
Under this teaching philosophy, students are no longer grouped by ability; and 
the reading texts contain a higher quality of literature and less emphasis on 
word recognition. 
</P>
<P>
But will this new approach produce sixth-graders who are better critical 
readers? Or is this just another educational fad? 
</P>
<P>
The whole-language theory of reading development has at least five disabling 
suppositions. Taken together they comprise an invitation for disaster for 
reading instruction: 
</P>
<P>
1) Whole language insists that children best learn to read the same way they 
learn to speak, that is, with no formal instruction. The reading research, to 
the contrary, supports direct, systematic and intensive teaching of reading. 
</P>
<P>
2) Whole language de-emphasizes word recognition. Children can comprehend the 
meaning of a written sentence before they can recognize the words in it, says 
the state Department of Education's "English-Language Arts Framework," which 
mandates whole-language instruction for teachers. The truth is that there has 
been no reading factor more closely related to comprehension than quick and 
accurate word recognition. 
</P>
<P>
3) Whole language encourages children to omit, substitute and insert words in 
sentences they read -- at will. Students thus are encouraged to make eccentric 
decisions as to precisely what an author intended to impart. No accurate 
literal or critical reading is possible under these circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
4) Whole language denies that there is any sequence of reading skills. 
Everything about reading must be taught simultaneously, whole-language 
proponents maintain. Quite the contrary, says the research. Teaching a 
hierarchy of reading skills, from the easiest to the more difficult, works 
best. 
</P>
<P>
5) Since the whole-language theory has fared badly when examined 
experimentally, leaders in the movement now claim that experimental research 
findings in reading are fraudulent. According to whole-language proponents, the 
only proper way to evaluate progress in reading development is to write 
subjective anecdotes of children's reading behavior. It goes without saying 
that this disavowal of the scientific method raises alarms about the merit of 
its other propositions. 
</P>
<P>
The delivery of critical reading skills is the most important function of the 
schools. One cannot participate effectively in a democratic society without 
this ability. People without reading skills often find themselves on welfare 
rolls or in prison. Poor readers require costly remedial instruction. 
</P>
<P>
The taxpaying public must provide for all these services. It is not only 
parents, therefore, who have a vital stake in making sure that the schools are 
not indulging in transitory fads and theories, which Harvard President Derek 
Bok recently chastised them for doing. 
</P>
<P>
A critical question for our school board members therefore should be: "Did you 
understand what you were approving when you authorized the whole-language 
approach to reading development?"

JACKSON DRIVE EXTENSION PRO, CON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The extension of Jackson Drive from Mission Gorge Road to California 52 in 
Mission Trails Regional Park has been a controversial project, with the pros 
and cons being debated in community gatherings for many months. What has 
disturbed me the most about these debates is the misinformation that has been 
bantered about by the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
This extension of Jackson Drive was part of the 1960 "Proposed Fortuna 
Mountain-Mission Gorge Metropolitan Park" plan and has been a part of all 
subsequent park plans. I led the efforts to purchase Cowles Mountain in 1974, 
the link between the Lake Murray and Mission Gorge areas of the park, and have 
participated in all park development activities since. 
</P>
<P>
When the 1976 master development plan for the park was adopted, there was no 
opposition to the extension of Jackson Drive. Nor was there any opposition when 
the revised plan was approved in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
It has been obvious since the beginning planning stages that the extension of 
Jackson Drive would involve massive grading. This should not have come as a 
surprise to anyone who has seen the rugged terrain. Opponents have claimed that 
Jackson Drive was proposed as a two-lane road through the park, yet the 1976 
and 1985 master development plans state that ". . . three major public highways 
are proposed to ultimately traverse this area of the park. (California) 52 will 
be extended east to form the northern park boundary; Jackson Drive, having 
crossed the San Diego River, will link up with the easterly extension of 
Clairemont Mesa Boulevard and then turn north along the plateau to connect with 
Highway 52. . . . It should be emphasized that these are multimillion-dollar 
improvements to serve circulation needs in this portion of the metropolitan 
area. They are not park roads." 
</P>
<P>
The plan then describes the internal park roads that would be accessed from 
Jackson Drive. These roads would provide public access into this area of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
This has not been an easy issue for Councilwoman Judy McCarty, even though 
there was strong support for the road from the constituents of District 7. It 
was necessary to weigh the need for the road (an estimated 20,000 vehicle trips 
per day) against the environmental damage that would occur, and the cost of the 
road (an estimated $40 million including environmental mitigations). The 
opponents claimed that the road was too expensive, that the benefits did not 
outweigh the costs, yet these same people have not opposed an extra $10 million 
added to the cost of California 52 to develop a habitat area for 12 pairs of 
Least Bell's Vireos in the Hollins Lake area of the park. 
</P>
<P>
There will always be people who would like to see the park remain a wildlife 
preserve. I anticipate that the extension of Jackson Drive will be only the 
first of many attempts to prevent any expansion of public use of the park. I 
commend those on the San Diego City Council who voted to support the extension 
of Jackson Drive (to be renamed Mission Trails Parkway) and encourage the 
support of the entire council as we move forward to implement the master plan.

POLICE SEARCHING FOR MISSING TODDLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Saturday night were searching for a 14-month-old toddler who reportedly 
disappeared in the Golden Hill area earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The infant girl reportedly disappeared between 8 and 8:30 a.m. from her home in 
the 1600 block of 30th Street, possibly wearing only a diaper, said Sgt. Chuck 
Peck. 
</P>
<P>
"Both parents live there and they discovered the child missing," he said. 
"We're not sure if she was abducted or she just got up and walked away." 
</P>
<P>
The infant's mother said the girl was last seen about 7 a.m. "I was awakened at 
8:56 and she was gone," she said. "She must have walked out the front door. 
We're hoping someone found her and still has her."

FIRMS PLAN RECYCLING PLANT, LANDFILL TO HANDLE ALL NORTH COUNTY GARBAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans to build a private, $30-million trash recycling plant next to California 
78 in San Marcos were hastily announced Friday by Lusardi Construction Co. in 
San Marcos and the Pittsburgh-based Chambers Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
The plant and a 1,500-acre landfill planned for the Los Coyotes Indian 
reservation east of Warner Springs would have the capacity to handle all of the 
North County's annual 1.2-million tons of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The private effort is in direct competition with the county's current efforts 
to locate new landfill sites, build several trash-transfer stations in North 
County urban areas, and construct a $300-million trash-burning plant in San 
Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal received tentative approval in August from the San Marcos City 
Council but was not made public until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Lounsbery, who will head the Lusardi subsidiary involved in the San Marcos 
plant, said the project is a joint venture with the city of San Marcos and 
could be built and operating by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"San Marcos is the only city in North County to have something to gain from 
this facility," Lounsbery said. 
</P>
<P>
"The quid pro quo is that the city would then be able to close the San Marcos 
landfill," which now is reaching capacity and will be expanded if it remains as 
the only trash dump operating in North County. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos Mayor Lee Thibadeau admitted that the city had kept the private 
project under wraps, passing a vaguely worded ordinance approving an industrial 
development on 29 acres of city-owned land along Rancheros Drive east of Twin 
Oaks Valley Road. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want this to get out until we had the details worked out," Thibadeau 
said. "We still don't have all the answers. It is still premature and we can 
back out if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the city had gone in as equal partners with Lusardi in the 
trash-processing plant "because of the lack of action and direction from the 
county" in its efforts to build a trash-to-energy facility that would relieve 
the crisis created by increasing amounts of trash. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have been negotiating with private firms since 1982 to build 
and operate a trash-burning facility that could handle about half of North 
County's refuse, but lawsuits by plant opponents and difficulties in 
negotiations with private firms have stalled the project, which would reduce 
the need for additional landfill space. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the city's intent to cover ourselves," Thibadeau said. "The county has 
been dragging its feet in solving the trash situation. There's no guarantee 
that we will see the county board (of supervisors) solve this problem in the 
next 10 years. We want a solution now." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Lusardi-Chambers proposal, called Palomar 2000, Lusardi would build 
an 89,000-square-foot trash recycling and transfer center at Rancheros and Mata 
Way, on the north side of California 78. The refuse remaining after recycling 
would be trucked to the Los Coyotes landfill for burial. 
</P>
<P>
Lounsbery said that Lusardi and Chambers have a contract under which Chambers 
would build the outlying landfill and operate both the facilities. Initial 
plans call for the plant to handle about 600,000 tons of trash annually, he 
said, but an expansion plan to handle the entire North County trash flow are 
included. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Chase, consultant and spokesman for the Chambers firm, said word of the 
San Marcos venture surfaced when he was speaking to a group of Warner Springs 
residents about the proposed landfill and was asked where the trash was coming 
from. 
</P>
<P>
"So I told them about the San Marcos program and the word spread," Chase said. 
Chase and Lounsbery met Friday with Bill Worrell, deputy director of the county 
Public Works Department, which is formulating competing plans for trash 
transfer stations and new landfill sites for North County. 
</P>
<P>
Worrell said after the meeting that the county must be in control of any trash 
recycling and disposal operation "because we know what has happened in Eastern 
cities when private companies handled the job and then pulled out in a year or 
two." 
</P>
<P>
"The cities ended up sending their trash out of state as the only way to 
dispose of it, and that can be a very expensive proposition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Worrell also questioned whether the Los Coyotes Reservation site is suitable 
for a landfill because of its distance from North County. Several proposed 
county landfill sites were dropped from consideration because of their distance 
from the coastal cities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lounsbery said the private venture would require county participation, but "I 
imagine that it would be in the field of rate-setting." Private ownership of 
the recycling center in San Marcos and the inland landfill is key to the 
project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thibadeau agreed that the county should play a role in the private 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the county has to agree with it or I'm not buying it either," he 
said.

USING A RIFLE, NOT A SHOTGUN, IN MEDFLY WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I think most of us in Orange County, including Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder 
and Roger R. Stanton, who are opposed to aerial spraying of malathion can see 
the obvious merit of pinpointing areas of Medfly infestation through more 
intensive trapping ("Supervisors Reject Plan for More Medfly Trapping Sites," 
Nov. 28). As Prof. (James) Carey (of UC Davis) indicated, a rifle rather than a 
shotgun could then be used to eradicate the pests. 
</P>
<P>
The reason Orange County Citizens Against Malathion Spraying opposed this 
measure by the California Department of Food and Agriculture was that they have 
had ample opportunities in the past to use a rifle (ground spraying) instead of 
a shotgun (aerial spraying), but they have failed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Neither were they willing to agree to ground spraying instead of aerial 
spraying if they had the OK to disperse more traps. 
</P>
<P>
Why then should we make it easier for them to once again violate our property 
rights and endanger our health? These guys are addicted to the shotgun 
approach, and I suspect the chemical and helicopter companies involved are part 
of the decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
You'd think that after having declared that the Medfly has been eradicated at 
least in nine of the past 11 years, somebody in the agriculture department 
would have long ago concluded that this is a war with no final victory and an 
alternative to spraying urban areas must be instituted. 
</P>
<P>
But no, why do that when it's easier to declare a state of emergency, take to 
the choppers and shotgun the people in the hope of nailing some Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
They never developed adequate facilities for breeding sterile Medflies nor did 
they ever invest anything but token funding into other methods of biological 
controls. Why trust them now? 
</P>
<P>
Our thanks go to Supervisors Wieder and Stanton for placing our health and 
welfare above the monetary interests of agribusiness.

COUNTY COUNCIL FOR THE ARTS IS NEEDED; 
</P>
<P>
* ACTIONS IN COSTA MESA, GARDEN GROVE POINT UP THE JERRY-BUILT SYSTEM NOW IN 
USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a representative from Orange County addressed the California Confederation 
of the Arts, the state's largest arts advocacy organization, at its annual 
convention in Los Angeles recently, the appearance itself was evidence for the 
message. David Emmes, producing-artistic director of Costa Mesa's South Coast 
Repertory theater, delivered a timely address on the need for a countywide arts 
council, so as to lend a stronger voice to the local arts community. 
</P>
<P>
Amen. And the fact that Emmes' address represented an about-face from an 
earlier decision not to accept an invitation to speak on "The Fight for Freedom 
of Expression" was eloquent testimony on the need for a better organized arts 
lobby in Orange County. Emmes had complained earlier that he had been given 
inadequate notice of the panel discussion and almost didn't participate. The 
opportunity to address the most important assembly in California on an arts 
advocacy question surely would not have been lost on an alert county arts 
council, which could have coordinated the effort to bring Orange County's arts 
funding wars to the attention of a larger audience. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Orange County has been having a rough time of it of late. The Costa 
Mesa City Council's approval last summer of arts-grant restrictions banning the 
use of city money for obscenity or religious or political activity cast Orange 
County in an unfavorable national light on the arts stage. That embarrassing 
chapter in county arts history itself might have been headed off if a county 
council had been in place to mobilize the region's arts community. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Orange County had a jerry-built system for rescuing freedom of 
expression from the endangered species list. In Garden Grove, for example, the 
City Council took the view that Shakespeare was the equivalent of a foreign 
auto or high-tech electronics import, flooding the market and knocking out 
American products from competition. So it was left to an anonymous donor to 
give $10,000 to the Grove Shakespeare Festival, as well as a group of 
firefighters, a local hotel and small contributors, to keep alive Shakespeare 
for another day. A countywide arts council certainly could have helped spread 
and strengthen the safety net. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors, struggling to meet a wide range of needs, earlier 
this year ruled out substantial funding for a council. But it's clear that 
somehow Orange County needs an organization to lobby for the arts and protect 
them from self-appointed censors.

COUNTY'S ANNUAL SURVEY ENCOURAGING; 
</P>
<P>
* IT SHOWS A COMMITMENT TO MAKE THINGS WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From afar, Orange County is easily stereotyped as a kitschy mix of right-wing 
extremists, glamorous Newport Beach jet-setters and freeway cowboys, with a 
heavy dose of back-yard barbecuers. 
</P>
<P>
But as the Orange County Annual Survey revealed last week, people here are much 
more complex, and much more mainstream, than that. They are worried not just 
about preserving their suburban lifestyle but about their own impact on the 
environment. They hate traffic congestion and seem more willing than before to 
pay for mass transit to relieve it. They are concerned about growth but are 
just as worried about providing housing for young families who hope to buy 
their first homes. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the ninth annual survey's latest snapshot reveals that Orange 
County's reputation for provincialism and extreme politics does not adequately 
reflect the maturity that residents are in fact showing in 1990. These new 
attitudes are important because they can empower the people who live here to 
deal with today's complicated problems. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the pessimism so dominant in previous surveys has leveled off, 
indicating residents aren't indulging in doom and gloom or an attitude of 
resignation about problems. Yes, people seem frightened about the current 
downturn in the economy, but there is an underlying commitment to make things 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Those are all good signs. It is important that local leaders build on that 
sentiment to help Orange County confront the very tough economic times that 
appear to be ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the survey found that the environment has evolved into one 
of the county's major concerns, ranking with crime, taxes and jobs. Residents 
have been conserving water and recycling trash, especially in the past year, 
many for the first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
The tougher issue of reducing gasoline consumption, however, still has not yet 
been seriously confronted, the survey indicated. The same huge percentage of 
residents -- about 80% -- prefer commuting solo to any other means of 
transportation. They like the idea of high-speed trains or other methods of 
public transit, but, for now at least, they prefer to leave the alternatives to 
others. 
</P>
<P>
But transportation officials should take note that "improving public 
transportation" ranked almost as high as "widening existing freeways" as a 
funding priority -- a marked change from six years ago. There is a strong 
interest in rapid rail, including monorails, as a way to ease traffic. And 
people are much more willing to entertain the idea of car pools or public 
transit when they are confronted with higher parking fees and other increased 
costs of driving. That means that there is a unique opportunity to build 
political support for mass transit and car-pooling. 
</P>
<P>
One other significant survey finding is that Orange County residents are very 
suspicious of regional government as a means of addressing problems. Keep in 
mind that such approaches have worked well elsewhere, and may become important 
in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Annual Survey was conducted by UC Irvine social ecology 
professor Mark Baldassare and researcher Cheryl Katz, and sponsored by public 
agencies, private foundations and corporations, including The Times Orange 
County edition. Combined with November's surprising election results -- in 
which a countywide half-cent sales tax for transportation and two important 
local environmental measures were approved -- the survey results indicate that 
Orange County is growing up.

WAS GIONIS TRIAL RECORDING ALTERED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I just read the Dec. 5 stories by Dana Parsons ("Witness Box Massacre Not a 
Pretty Sight") and Jerry Hicks ("Secret Recording Jolts Prosecution in Trial of 
Dr. Gionis") about the apparent discrediting of prosecution witness Robert 
Davis in the Gionis trial. 
</P>
<P>
This should not have been such a decisive victory for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't the prosecution argue that the tape of the interview between Davis 
and (Dr. Thomas A. Gionis' limo driver, Ray) Ruiz may have been altered? It's 
entirely possible that the tape presented by the defense may be a copy of an 
edited original. 
</P>
<P>
If this evidence is as important as the story implies, it may be worthwhile for 
the prosecution to have an audio specialist examine the tape. 
</P>
<P>
I was under the impression that tape recordings and photographs are not 
admissible evidence because they are so easily altered.

A WELCOME INVESTMENT IN TRAIN DEPOTS; 
</P>
<P>
* RENOVATION IN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, NEW CONSTRUCTION IN IRVINE BENEFIT 
COMMUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If commuters are going to get out of their automobiles and into railroad cars, 
it will take more than simply having trains arrive and depart on time. The 
commuter's experience while at the station can make a considerable difference 
in the choice to make the railroad a regular habit. 
</P>
<P>
The train station at San Juan Capistrano is a terminal point in the Orange 
County Transportation Commission's commuter train service, and it has the lure 
of history. Last week, after being closed 11 months for renovations, the 
19th-Century depot reopened to some well-deserved fanfare by city officials, 
preservationists and commuters. That was important for about 500 commuters who 
now board trains out of the city-owned station, and for others who may be 
inclined to follow. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation has been done with respectful attention to the past; the station 
first opened in 1897, when tourists came in by rail to take the waters at San 
Juan Hot Springs. The Spanish colonial revival architecture has been preserved, 
and the depot's front yard has been converted into a patio for seating for a 
new restaurant. A continental breakfast bar is coming soon so that commuters 
will be able to await the train in pleasant surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation work was done by the restaurant operator under the auspices of 
the city Redevelopment Agency. In the bargain, the restaurant got a guaranteed 
supply of customers, and the city got a remodeled station, complete with a new 
commuter waiting area. If the state comes through with hoped-for money for new 
and safer platforms, an old station will really be up to speed for late 
20th-Century travel. 
</P>
<P>
While San Juan Capistrano has centered restoration around a restaurant, Irvine, 
another important stop along the Orange County-Los Angeles commuter route, 
started from the ground up and built a spiffy new station that opened earlier 
in the year. These different approaches have provided two cities with wonderful 
train stations. 
</P>
<P>
A good station of any vintage is a civilized place, and a welcome alternative 
to encountering fellow travelers while stuck in traffic.

DARTMOUTH COLLEGE FIGHTS REVIEW TYPE-CASTING; 
</P>
<P>
IVY LEAGUE: FACULTY AND STUDENTS SAY THE PAPER HAS GIVEN THE SCHOOL AN 
UNDESERVED REPUTATION FOR RACISM AND SEXISM. 
</P>

<P>
Students, teachers and administrators say it over and over again. They write 
it, they shout it: 
</P>
<P>
Dartmouth College is not the Dartmouth Review. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, Dartmouth College has been portrayed as a battlefield of racism, 
sexism and political intrigue, all reflected in the activities of the 
obstreperous, right-wing Review. 
</P>
<P>
The Review has dominated national news coverage of Dartmouth, but faculty 
members and a broad sampling of students said in interviews that they believe 
the school has been shown in a false light. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience has been that there is no one here that is overtly prejudiced, 
that is overtly racist, that is overtly sexist," said junior Mindy Waterhouse, 
a founder of a campus women's group and an intern at a college-run 
clearinghouse on women's issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Review -- a student-run publication not affiliated with the Ivy League 
college -- is nothing if not overt. 
</P>
<P>
On Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1986, Review staff members used sledgehammers 
to tear down shanties that apartheid protesters had erected on the campus 
green. In August, music Prof. William Cole, who is black, resigned, citing the 
strain of years of being attacked in the Review. 
</P>
<P>
The publicity has taken its toll on the school. Alfred Quirk, admissions and 
financial aid dean, said that black enrollment slipped a bit this year, to 5% 
from 6% of the incoming class of 1,067. He blames the Review contretemps. 
</P>
<P>
In September, a quote from Adolf Hitler's "Mein Kampf" was inserted in the 
masthead of the edition of the Review that was circulated on the Jewish holy 
day Yom Kippur. The Review claims that it was sabotage, and has Hanover police 
investigating the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the source of the insert, it was a campus call to arms. Administrators 
and students denounced the Review, and 2,500 people turned out for a protest 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
"I was heartened beyond words at the warm, loving response of Dartmouth 
students," said senior Allen Drexel, chairman of the Dartmouth Area Gay and 
Lesbian Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Dartmouth students who have gone silent for a long time with 
regard to the Review's attacks on vulnerable social groups were able to 
collectively absolve themselves of past neglect." 
</P>
<P>
Apathy or fear of disrupting the status quo -- not pervasive bigotry -- is to 
blame for the atmosphere in which the Review has flourished, Drexel said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say Dartmouth students, rather than being conservative in any partisan 
sense . . . are conservative in the sense of reluctance to rock the boat," 
Drexel said. "In a system that seems to work for them, why even think about 
changing things?" 
</P>
<P>
The Review also flourishes because prominent conservatives such as columnist 
Pat Buchanan and former Treasury Secretary William Simon support it. Simon has 
written that college administrators are persecuting the paper and its staff. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Dartmouth alumni also contribute funds to the Review. Some see it 
as a hedge against liberal influences that forced the rewording of the alma 
mater, "Men of Dartmouth," and abandonment of the school mascot, an American 
Indian. 
</P>
<P>
"Our perception of tradition today is different from what tradition was in the 
past," said student Brian Pierce. "Now we have women on campus, now we have 
native Americans who are against having the symbol because it's offensive to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Tradition should be kept if it enhances the Dartmouth experience now, but if 
it detracts from it, there's no point in clinging to tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Dartmouth's defenders do not deny that there is prejudice on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that Dartmouth is a frightening place to be gay to the same extent 
that the country is a frightening place," Drexel said. "The institution isn't 
perfect. I think everybody will freely admit that." 
</P>
<P>
Trecia Canty, a senior and president of the Afro-American Society, said she has 
at times felt "distinctly uncomfortable" as a black student. 
</P>
<P>
She said the Review's attacks on Cole during her freshman year made the whole 
black community feel under fire. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time I perceived it (as moving from) his credibility and qualifications 
as a professor being questioned to all the qualifications of all 
African-Americans, faculty and students alike, being questioned," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Canty said, however, that she regards the occasional "insensitive comment" made 
in her presence as "more the result of ignorance . . . than actual intent to be 
hurtful." 
</P>
<P>
Other blacks, such as William Cook, an English professor, credit Dartmouth with 
fighting intolerance, especially under college President James O. Freedman. 
</P>
<P>
Cook attributed Dartmouth's problems at least partly to its location in a small 
town on the borders of two predominantly white states, Vermont and New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens on this campus with respect to race is more important because 
there is no larger black community," he said. "That's why we're getting all the 
attention. The same things happen on other campuses." 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate question for women, minority and gay students and faculty members 
is whether they would recommend Dartmouth to others like themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely would," Cook said. "We need that critical mass of people to 
constitute a community." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel said that while he is glad he came to Dartmouth, it was difficult.

POPULATION OF DOLPHINS FOUND STEADY

<TEXT>
<P>
Populations of various dolphin species in the Eastern Pacific appear to have 
remained steady in recent years amid concerns that deep-sea nets used by tuna 
fishing boats are killing large numbers of the mammals, the lead scientist of a 
dolphin-counting project said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Two ships from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration docked in 
San Diego Bay on Thursday after completing the fifth annual voyage of the 
six-year project to monitor dolphin populations in areas where the mammals are 
at risk of being killed in the purse seine nets of tuna boats. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary interest is, are the dolphin populations declining, and, if they 
are, does it have to do with the purse seine?" said Tim Gerrodette, the chief 
scientist for the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found no evidence that the dolphins are declining in abundance," 
Gerrodette said. "But they are still considerably below what they were when the 
(purse-seine) fishing started." 
</P>
<P>
The welfare of dolphins has been a major issue among environmentalists as well 
as commercial fishermen, who say they take great pains to protect dolphins but 
are being driven out of their traditional fishing grounds by the new labeling 
practices of American canners. 
</P>
<P>
Purse seines, introduced by the Southern California fleet about 1960, trap the 
air-breathing dolphins along with the tuna, drowning them and sometimes 
crushing them in the machinery that reels in the net. 
</P>
<P>
The major tuna companies have vowed to no longer buy fish unless they were 
caught using "dolphin-safe" methods that don't trap the mammals in the nets. 
</P>
<P>
A new federal law requiring tuna cans to carry dolphin-safe labels goes into 
effect in April. 
</P>
<P>
Catching tuna without endangering dolphins means American boats must sail 
thousands of extra miles to areas in the South Pacific and Atlantic where 
dolphins and tuna do not swim together. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of sensitivity to the numbers on the part of environmentalists 
and fishermen," Gerrodette said. 
</P>
<P>
The vessels McArthur and David Starr Jordan left San Diego in late July and 
covered about 45,000 miles of open sea in a triangular area stretching from 
Peru and Baja California west to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Observers using yardlong sets of binoculars and a helicopter made a visual 
tally of dolphins and will try to estimate how many they failed to see, using a 
complex series of mathematical computations. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of dolphins of a variety of species live in the area, including 
eastern spinner dolphins and northern offshore spotted dolphins, the two 
species most frequently affected by tuna fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Gerrodette said the processing of the data will be completed in about six 
months, shortly before the sixth and final counting mission sets sail. 
</P>
<P>
The information will be used to compile a study that will be used by Congress 
when it considers reauthorization of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a heightened interest in this these days, but this study was 
planned six to seven years ago, before tuna-labeling," Gerrodette said.

SCALE OF THE JAIL: WHY THE RESIDENTS ARE WORRIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent articles and editorials in The Times about Orange County's problems with 
finding a solution to jail overcrowding have done a serious disservice to the 
people of this county. 
</P>
<P>
The blame for the current debacle is being laid at the feet of the people 
because of something called a "not in my back yard" attitude. 
</P>
<P>
We are being portrayed as selfish children who are unreasonably thwarting 
authorities in their courageous attempts to do what is best for us. 
</P>
<P>
This attitude is simplistic and wrong. What the people of Orange County object 
to is not the building of a jail in their back yard but the building of the 
largest maximum security jail in the nation in their back yard. We object to 
the largest maximum security jail in the nation being placed in one of our 
growing communities, effectively destroying it. 
</P>
<P>
No community should have to shoulder the responsibility of a 6,720-bed prison. 
We object to waiting years and suffering through the inevitable delays and cost 
overruns that building the largest-ever jail would cause. 
</P>
<P>
We object to 60,000 more automobile trips a day along the already-overburdened 
Riverside and Costa Mesa freeways. We object to more of our hard-earned money 
being taken away to cover the astronomical costs of building and operating a 
jail of this size. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, we object to the lack of realistic options being presented to us 
by our elected leaders. 
</P>
<P>
We will not be forced into bad decisions so a sheriff can build an empire or a 
politician can win another term. Our resistance to the current jail proposal is 
not selfish or unreasonable. We simply know a bad idea when we see one.

SCALE OF THE JAIL: WHY THE RESIDENTS ARE WORRIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest the ongoing discussions about the location of the Orange 
County Jail. I read with dismay the proposals to put the new jail in any 
location other than adjacent to the existing jail in the Civic Center in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that in this matter the supervisors are bowing to pressure and 
abrogating their responsibilities to Orange County residents as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for locating the jail adjacent to the existing jail appear to be 
obvious. They are: 
</P>
<P>
* It will be less expensive. The county already owns the land. 
</P>
<P>
* It will facilitate administration and will cut down on the expense of 
transportation of prisoners from the jail to court. The logistic problem 
inherent in moving prisoners from a jail in another location to court in the 
Civic Center is staggering, and overtime will probably double the actual cost 
of the jail. 
</P>
<P>
* It will result in greater convenience to all concerned -- the sheriff's 
office, the prisoners and the judges.

LAWNDALE MAY AMEND CONDO ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale City Council voted unanimously Thursday to consider amending a 
controversial condominium ordinance to allow developers to use part of the 
front setback to fulfill recreational-space requirements for individual units. 
</P>
<P>
At a public hearing before the vote, several people, including Planning 
Commissioner Bruce McKee, spoke against the amendment, saying it would simply 
allow developers to build larger units. 
</P>
<P>
Although the condominium ordinance was designed to allow development on only 
the largest of lots, the amendment "is an attempt to qualify all lots" for 
development, McKee said. He was the only member of the Planning Commission who 
recommended against passage. 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale resident Steve Mino agreed. "I think this thing should be turned down 
because we don't have enough open space as it is now," Mino said. 
</P>
<P>
Developers have claimed that the condominium ordinance, passed in February, 
requires too much open space, but some council members have said the new 
standards are too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Councilman Larry Rudolph said he was concerned about what 
effect the amendment would have on lots that have access from both the front 
and the rear units, and Councilwoman Carol Norman criticized it for not 
providing enough open space. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their concerns, the council finally agreed to consider the issue at its 
next meeting but advised the Planning Commission to review the entire 
condominium ordinance and to come back with suggestions on how to improve it.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. BOARD OKS HYPERION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans to broaden the scope of a project to overhaul and expand the Hyperion 
sewage plant have won the endorsement of the Los Angeles Board of Public Works 
despite El Segundo's concerns about the effect on nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
In a 4-0 vote Wednesday, the board approved an updated plan calling for a 
finished facility capable of providing intensified treatment for 450 million 
gallons of sewage per day. 
</P>
<P>
The original plan contemplates upgraded treatment for 330 million gallons per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo says the city of Los Angeles has not adequately considered air 
pollution, noise pollution and other problems the Hyperion expansion might 
cause for residents near the Playa del Rey plant. Los Angeles, it argues, 
should minimize construction at Hyperion by upgrading treatment at other plants 
in its sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo has filed a suit against Los Angeles alleging that the plant's 
operations and the expansion work create a public nuisance. City Manager Ron 
Cano said Friday that El Segundo will file a second suit if Los Angeles does 
not respond to its concerns over the updated plan. 
</P>
<P>
But Hyperion engineer Sam Furuta defended the updated plan. "The alternative 
we've selected is the best one in terms of environmental impacts, costs, 
scheduling and everything else, in our opinion," Furuta said Friday.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EXTENSION FOR GENERAL PLAN SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale City Council voted unanimously Thursday to seek a one-year 
extension from the state to revise and enact a General Plan, which cities are 
required to have in order to pass zoning laws or issue special zoning permits. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been without a valid General Plan since November, 1989, when 
voters refused to endorse the plan that had been enacted in 1976, saying it was 
too outdated. 
</P>
<P>
The request for an extension must be approved by the state Office of Planning 
and Research. 
</P>
<P>
For the last year, a General Plan review committee has been working on a 
revision. In its request for an extension, city officials cited Planning 
Department staffing problems and budgetary constraints as reasons for the delay 
in getting a new plan before the voters.

INS CONSIDERS CHARGING FEE AT BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The home of the brave may soon become the land of the fee. The Immigration and 
Naturalization Service is drafting a plan to charge people who enter the United 
States on foot or by car. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which is still on the drawing board, already has critics lining 
up like weekend travelers at the Tijuana border crossing. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a hell of a way to balance their budget," scoffs Mario Moreno, regional 
counsel of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "Charging 
fees at the border is not the way to take care of the gross mismanagement of 
the INS." 
</P>
<P>
Says Jill Scheldrup, state and local programs manager for the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce: "It would appear that it would create yet another barrier to persons 
coming into this country." 
</P>
<P>
The experimental plan was included in a Justice Department appropriations 
measure passed by Congress earlier this year. It calls for the INS to conduct a 
three-year test of charging fees at congested border crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 429,028,310 residents and aliens were admitted to the United States 
through official ports of entry, the INS says. The numbers do not include those 
who entered the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
The Tijuana-San Diego border is considered the world's busiest international 
crossing. In the most recent fiscal year, some 50 million people entered U.S. 
territory via that port of entry; most were aboard 13 million vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Any plans to institute a border entry fee would likely stir harsh criticism in 
the San Diego-Tijuana area, which, like other border regions, is heavily 
dependant on trans-national commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the busiest checkpoints have experienced a sharp increase in traffic in 
recent years. The seemingly endless lines of idling cars during holiday 
weekends at the Tijuana-San Ysidro border crossing is a Southern California 
legend. 
</P>
<P>
The money generated by the fees would be used to pay for more INS agents and 
facilities with the goal of cutting down on congestion. At the end of the 
three-year period, a decision will be made on whether to continue or expand the 
fee project. 
</P>
<P>
Duke Austin, INS spokesman, is quick to point out that fees for entering the 
United States are not new. For several years the INS and the Customs Service 
have been adding a $5 surcharge on international plane tickets to pay for 
inspections. There are also several toll bridges connecting the United States 
with Canada and with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"The motivation for doing this is we have impacted areas on our northern and 
southern borders where there are huge backlogs, unacceptable backlogs," Austin 
says. Absent additional funding from the federal government, "How do you put 
new resources there?" 
</P>
<P>
Austin says the INS is looking at various options for putting the fee program 
into place, and that the plan should be ready to present to Congress sometime 
in January. Congress then has 60 days to review it. As it stands now, it 
appears the INS will create a toll "express lane" at as yet undetermined border 
crossings. Other lanes would remain free. 
</P>
<P>
Still undecided, Austin said, is how exactly to collect the fee and whether to 
offer a monthly pass for migrant workers and other frequent crossers. 
</P>
<P>
But Moreno and others fear the program will ultimately lead to a regressive tax 
on anyone entering or leaving the country. Such fees would be an economic 
hardship on poor migrant workers and border town businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Some praise the idea as a way to keep America's often chaotic border situation 
under control. "We think it's a marvelous and outstanding idea whose time has 
come," said Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American 
Immigration Reform. The group has long been a supporter of strict control of 
border areas and "user fees" for entry into the United States.

ESPERANZA WINS TITLE ON SECOND-HALF HEROICS; 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION III: SLOTBACK JAROD SMITH SCORES THREE TOUCHDOWNS IN FINAL TWO 
QUARTERS. THE AZTECS BEAT ST. PAUL, 25-7, TO COMPLETE A PERFECT SEASON.

<P>
Jarod Smith wasn't exactly elated when his 75-yard touchdown run on the second 
play from scrimmage was called back on a motion penalty. 
</P>
<P>
And the Esperanza High School slotback wasn't exactly jumping for joy when he 
fumbled the ball after catching a 13-yard pass from Keith McDonald a few plays 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what was going to happen after I had messed up in the first 
half," Smith said. "At halftime, the coaches told me to go out and just run." 
</P>
<P>
Smith did just that, running for three second-half touchdowns to lead Esperanza 
to a 25-7 victory over St. Paul in the Southern Section Division III 
championship game Saturday night at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who had 46 yards in 11 carries, scored on runs of five, 16 and two yards 
in the second half as the Aztecs (14-0) capped the first perfect season in 
school history. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beyond my wildest dreams that we'd be 14-0 right now," Esperanza Coach 
Gary Meek said. "We set a goal to win two Southern Section games this year." 
</P>
<P>
They won four. 
</P>
<P>
It was Esperanza's first section title since 1979. The Aztecs lost in the 
finals in 1980, '82 and '84. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great team," Meek said. "And this group is in some pretty fast 
company when you're talking about winning." 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul (8-4-2) lost not only the game but also defensive back David Toruno, 
who apparently broke his leg while breaking up a pass in the end zone with 2 
minutes 22 seconds left in the third quarter. The game was stopped for 15 
minutes while officials waited for paramedics to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays after Toruno was injured, Smith scored on a five-yard run to give 
Esperanza a 10-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Smith scored his second touchdown on a 16-yard run around the right side with 
with eight minutes left in the game. Smith also ran in the two-point 
conversion, giving Esperanza an 18-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown was set up by Esperanza defensive back Mark Parlin, who 
intercepted a pass by Al Borunda at the St. Paul 29-yard line and returned it 
to the 16. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's third touchdown run also was set up by an interception. Derrick Reaves 
intercepted a Borunda pass at the Esperanza 46, and the Aztecs drove 52 yards 
in six plays before Smith scored from two-yards out with 3:57 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We dominated St. Paul up front," Meek said. "Our front seven did a great job, 
and when we forced them to throw, the secondary made some great plays." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs rolled up 109 yards total offense in the first half, but they 
couldn't find their way into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul had problems too, gaining only 56 yards total offense in the first 
half. The Swordsmen drove to Esperanza's 15 late in the first quarter, but a 
sack by the Aztecs' Josh Gale and a pass breakup by Jason Perez stalled the 
drive. Rick Camarena's 44-yard field goal attempt early in the second quarter 
fell five yards short. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza broke open a scoreless game late in the second quarter. The Aztecs 
got the ball at the Swordsmen 26-yard line with 39 seconds left in the first 
half after a 21-yard punt by Matt Lenzen. 
</P>
<P>
A pass interference call on St. Paul's Tom Vasquez and a 13-yard pass from 
Keith McDonald to Marcus Tayui gave Esperanza a first-and-goal at the St. Paul 
eight with 20 seconds left. After McDonald twice threw incomplete into the end 
zone, Clay King kicked a 25-yard field goal as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul took a 7-3 lead on the first possession of the second half. Shawn 
McKinney capped an 11-play, 68-yard drive with a 29-yard touchdown run with 
7:09 left in the third quarter.

TYSON IRONS OUT HIS ANGER; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: HE KNOCKS OUT STEWART IN THE FIRST ROUND, STRENGTHENING HIS ARGUMENT 
THAT HE SHOULD FIGHT HOLYFIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The primal force, the fighting machine that was Mike Tyson in his pre-Buster 
Douglas period, reappeared in all its fury at the Atlantic City Convention Hall 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Against a very good heavyweight, Alex Stewart, who made heavyweight champion 
Evander Holyfield fight for his life here 13 months ago, Tyson scored a 
knockout at 2:27 of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting before 17,211, Tyson heavily reinforced his argument that Holyfield 
should be required to fight him, not George Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
Remember those other one- and two-round Tyson victories? Michael Spinks? Carl 
Williams? Trevor Berbick? Marvis Frazier? Tony Tubbs? Forget them. Tyson never 
looked as good as he did Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old former champion knocked the British-born, Jamaica-raised and 
Brooklyn-based Stewart down three times before referee Frank Capuccino stopped 
the fight. Tyson was down once himself -- from his own wild right hand that 
missed Stewart so completely that Tyson lost his feet. 
</P>
<P>
Capuccino was so caught up in the Tyson onslaught under the hot lights that he 
started a count over Stewart after the third knockdown. The fight ended when 
Stewart hit the deck for the third time because the three-knockdown rule was in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
Many in boxing wondered if the punishment Tyson absorbed in his upset loss to 
Buster Douglas in Tokyo had left him a lesser fighter, perhaps dulled the edge 
of his combativeness. Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is the building. For Tyson's opponents, the Atlantic City Convention 
Hall -- home of the Miss America pageant -- is a torture chamber, a cavernous 
old arena on the boardwalk where this Brooklyn-raised street kid hurts and 
humiliates you. 
</P>
<P>
In his last three appearances there, Tyson had beaten Spinks in 91 seconds and 
Carl Williams in 93 seconds. Stewart required 147 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart wouldn't have taken so long, but he kept getting up. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson is 2-0 since losing to to Douglas, 39-1 overall, $5-million richer and 
only a bit sorry he beat up a nice guy such as Stewart. Tyson knocked out Henry 
Tillman in the first round in Las Vegas last June, but Stewart was a much more 
formidable opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"Alex Stewart is a nice guy, a class act, and I'm sorry it had to end this 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson said his best punch of the round was a right hand to the body, before the 
first knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a better body puncher than a head puncher," he said. "When I catch a guy 
clean to the body like that, I don't have to worry any more." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson had Stewart down seconds into the fight. He missed with his first punch, 
a long right, threw another and it landed flush. Stewart toppled over, took his 
standing-eight count, and got up. Then he began the worst possible deployment 
-- he started backing up. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson chased him, then caught him. He hit him with another long right and 
Stewart was down again. When he caught Stewart seconds later in a neutral 
corner, he finished him with a left hook. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson came in trim, at 217 3/4 pounds. Against Douglas in Tokyo, he was a 
slightly fleshy 220 1/2. Stewart weighed 218. Thirteen months ago in this 
building, Stewart had the No. 1 contender, Holyfield, in desperate trouble 
several times before losing because of a cut. 
</P>
<P>
No one before Saturday would have refused Stewart recognition as one of the 
world's three or four best heavyweights. But against this angry former 
champion, he was nearly defenseless. It was Tyson's 19th one-round knockout; 25 
of his 40 opponents have failed to make it to the end of Round 2. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson was to have fought Stewart (26-2) here last September but suffered an eye 
cut in training, forcing a postponement. 
</P>
<P>
The former champion later acknowledged that he isn't the most popular champion, 
but then further indicated he feeds off that perception. He was answering a 
question about a possible lack of confidence in himself after the loss to 
Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
"I never lost my confidence," he said. "I know that disappoints a lot of 
people, I know a lot of people wanted to see this cocky black kid fall . . . 
but I didn't. I am the best." 
</P>
<P>
Donovan (Razor) Ruddock, thought to be a rising force in the heavyweight 
division, fought on the undercard, and the man who will probably be matched 
against Tyson this spring knocked out hopelessly outclassed Mike Rouse in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful (6-3, 228) Ruddock (25-1-1), was to have fought Tyson in Edmonton 
13 months ago but missed that opportunity when Tyson pulled out of the fight, 
claiming illness. 
</P>
<P>
Ruddock beat Rouse (13-6-1 and a loser of five of his last seven) with what 
seemed to be a tame left hook midway through the first round. Rouse got up at 
the five count and wobbled to the ropes, where Ruddock finished him with a 
powerful, driving right to the chin. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Ruddock's promoter, Murad Muhammad, was suing Don King for pulling 
Tyson out of the Canada fight, but they now appear to have made up. King has 
promised a Tyson-Ruddock fight in the spring, or near the time (April 19) 
George Foreman challenges Evander Holyfield.

MIKE DOWNEY: NFL FANS JUST PAWNS IN THIS CHESS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A funny thing happened at a football game in San Francisco last Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Bowl XXIII and XXIV champion 49ers lined up against the Super Bowl 
XXI champion New York Giants in a game that got so much super-publicity, it was 
referred to -- adorably -- as Super Bowl XXIV 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Well, for four quarters the 49ers and the Giants slammed and rammed into one 
another, snapping, crackling and popping all over the field, in front of the 
largest audience ever to see one of ABC-television's Monday attractions. 
</P>
<P>
And when the game was over, the 49ers were victorious. 
</P>
<P>
Final score: 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
But that wasn't the interesting part. 
</P>
<P>
The interesting part came later, after the game. It continued the morning 
after. It continued the rest of the week, right up through today's NFL 
kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The interesting part is that, to this very day, people still can't agree 
whether the game they had just watched, 49ers-Giants, was the best game of the 
football season or the worst. 
</P>
<P>
Was this defensive football at its finest? 
</P>
<P>
Or was this the dullest thing this side of a Swedish movie? 
</P>
<P>
I watched the game with two people whose conclusion was: "What a snooze." 
</P>
<P>
The three of us agreed that sitting through three hours of the 49ers and Giants 
was preferable to, oh, getting bitten by a rabid dog. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, though, it was this game that bit. 
</P>
<P>
Next morning, nevertheless, we opened our favorite morning newspaper to 
discover that this game was a "gem." At least that's what the headline assured 
us, and after all, headlines report the facts. 
</P>
<P>
And a reporter covering the game conveyed to us that while most big games 
failed to live up to their buildups, this one had not, and that for once the 
"hitting equaled the hype." 
</P>
<P>
And furthermore, Bubba Paris, the round mound of sound who plays offensive 
tackle for the 49ers, was of the opinion that this had been "the best football 
game I've seen in my nine years associated with the National Football League." 
</P>
<P>
And linebacker Lawrence Taylor of the losing side said: "I wish we'd scored 
more points and won, but I'd have to say the fans got their money's worth from 
this one. It was a classic football game." 
</P>
<P>
And a neutral observer, Coach Buddy Ryan of the Philadelphia Eagles, said: "Now 
that's what I call a hell of a football battle." 
</P>
<P>
And another reporter gushed that it was a "spectacular" defensive football 
game. 
</P>
<P>
So, I was just about sold. 
</P>
<P>
But then, one by one, football fans of all sizes, shapes, ages and genders 
opened conversations with me by saying something along the lines of: "Was that 
the most boring football game you ever saw or what?" 
</P>
<P>
And former linebacker Tom Jackson, now of ESPN, commented on TV: "Kind of a 
dull game, wasn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
And quarterback Jim Kelly of the Buffalo Bills said: "I almost fell asleep." 
</P>
<P>
So, I decided to stand my ground. 
</P>
<P>
That was quite possibly the most disappointing football game I have seen in 
years, not counting games played on Super Bowl Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
That game was so slow and low-scoring, it should have been decided on penalty 
kicks. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sorry, but my idea of a good time is not watching Joe Montana and Phil 
Simms throw incomplete passes. 
</P>
<P>
And I haven't had to watch so much punting since the Ford Motor Co. sponsored a 
competition for children that also required them to pass and kick. In terms of 
entertainment, the 49er-Giant game was the closest thing I have seen to the 
Broadway show, "A Chorus Line" -- 1-2-3, kick; 1-2-3, kick. 
</P>
<P>
If you thought the first half was lousy, I hope you didn't have to sit through 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The halftime score, for those who have forgotten -- or have tried to forget -- 
was 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
How do we know this was a great defensive game? Because nobody scored in the 
whole second half? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was just a poor offensive game. 
</P>
<P>
If you're like me, you waited for weeks for this game. The 49ers! The Giants! 
Fasten your seat belts! 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we got Montana completing 12 of 29 passes for 152 yards. We got Simms 
completing 14 of 32 passes for 153 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The leading rusher for either side, Ottis Anderson, gained 39 yards. 
</P>
<P>
There were 16 punts. 
</P>
<P>
No points were scored in three of the four periods. 
</P>
<P>
One team's spectacular defense recorded zero sacks. 
</P>
<P>
And I still think the most interesting confrontation of the night was Simms' 
argument with Ronnie Lott on the field after the game. That had more drama than 
anything that preceded it, except for one very nice shot of the moon from the 
blimp. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, maybe you liked this game, but I'm looking for something with a little 
more excitement. I wonder if that Karpov-Kasparov chess thing is still going 
on.

MORNING BRIEFING: IS THIS THE DAY THAT MT. DITKA ERUPTS AGAIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friday, Vito Stellino of the Baltimore Sun recalled the Chicago Bears' 38-14 
loss to the Washington Redskins in 1989. Afterward, Bear Coach Mike Ditka went 
into a tantrum, said that Bear cornerback Donnell Woolford "couldn't cover 
anybody," and predicted that his team wouldn't win another game. 
</P>
<P>
Good prediction. The Bears lost their final three games and finished 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
Stellino also noted that Ditka brought a new, relaxed attitude to the Bears' 
training camp last July. When asked how long he thought it would last, Ditka 
said: "We'll see what happens when we get in the third period in Washington and 
the score is tied." 
</P>
<P>
The Bears play Washington at RFK Stadium today. 
</P>
<P>
Add Ditka: He said the media are primed for another outburst, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"My God, I'll tell you what, the camera is on me more. . . . If I had to run 
off and go to the bathroom I don't know what they'd do. They're not going to 
find anything. It's just not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Last add Ditka: Although he prides himself on his blue-collar image, his 
business empire has grown to the point where he has marketed his own 
fragrances. 
</P>
<P>
Joking with Stellino about the current economic climate, Ditka said: "The 
perfumes are down, the restaurants are down. I'm just struggling. I wish 
there'd be a little sympathy for me. As a matter of fact, maybe we can have a 
little tag day for me at RFK, everybody throw in a couple of bucks for me and 
that'll tide me through the next couple of months." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the oldest man to coach a major college football team? 
</P>
<P>
Green carpet treatment: Dave Wagner of Dodge City, Kan., said Friday that he 
and his wife Carol "are very happy to share some of our good fortune with 
Kansas State." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, a 1969 Kansas State graduate, donated $796,000 to install new 
artificial turf at KSU Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
He could afford it. Last July, he and his wife won $35 million in the Kansas 
lottery. 
</P>
<P>
Run-and-stun: In the 1989-90 college basketball season, Southern University 
averaged 99.2 points per game, third behind Loyola Marymount and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, after his team defeated Texas College, 159-65, Jaguar Coach Ben 
Jode told Guy Coates of the Associated Press it was "no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Attributing his style to the teaching of John McLendon, the former Tennessee 
State coach, Jode explained: 
</P>
<P>
"You try to get a shot every eight seconds. You try for 93 shots a game. The 
youngsters like it. It's great for the spectators. Some coaches say you don't 
win a championship with it. But McLendon always said if you combine upbeat 
defense with upbeat offense, you're going to get your 93 shots." 
</P>
<P>
Add Jode: He still invites McLendon, now retired, to visit Southern's practice 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jode: "He was here a couple of weeks ago. I sat on the bench and watched 
him coach." 
</P>
<P>
Rim shot time, baby: Inside Sports' anonymous columnist, "The Good Doctor," 
strikes again in the magazine's January edition, responding to "K.J. Jackson, 
Miss." 
</P>
<P>
Q: "Dick Vitale continues to be our favorite sportscaster. Is there anything 
that could make him even better?" 
</P>
<P>
A: "A 45-second clock." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Amos Alonzo Stagg, who was 84 when he coached College of the 
Pacific in 1946.

MINER TURNS RAVELING'S WORDS INTO DEEDS; 
</P>
<P>
USC: HE STOPS FORCING SHOTS, SCORES 24 POINTS AS TROJANS BEAT COLORADO STATE, 
74-67.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USC basketball Coach George Raveling pulled guard Harold Miner aside after the 
Trojans' 72-59 loss at Maryland last week because Raveling felt Miner was 
forcing his shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach told me to relax out there and try to pick my shots," Miner said. "I was 
forcing things and I wasn't playing my game." 
</P>
<P>
Miner, who has become more patient since meeting with Raveling, scored 24 
points as the Trojans defeated Colorado State, 74-67, Saturday night at Moby 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Playing before his family, which drove here from home in nearby Boulder, Colo., 
and sat behind the Trojan bench, Miner made nine of 13 shots, including three 
of four three-pointers. He also had seven rebounds, two assists and one steal. 
</P>
<P>
"The last two games, I think Harold has really started to understand offensive 
patience and shot selection," Raveling said. "I don't think Harold took a bad 
shot in the game tonight. He went a stretch of five minutes without a shot in 
the second half and he didn't lose his poise or get frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
After noticing that Miner went five minutes without shooting, Raveling called 
over guards Robert Pack and Duane Cooper and told them to get Miner back into 
the offensive flow of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Miner proceeded to score five consecutive points, making a jumper, adding a 
free throw and sinking a 15-footer, as the Trojans pulled away from the Rams 
with a 14-5 second-half run. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Ronnie Coleman was a force inside, scoring 19 points, 12 in the second 
half. Coleman made nine of 14 shots as the Trojans shot a season-high 62.5%, 
including 75% in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I liked about SC is that they got the ball where they wanted it," 
Colorado State Coach Boyd Grant said. "When they couldn't get the ball to 
Miner, they got it inside to Coleman." 
</P>
<P>
USC outran the Rams with its transition game in the second half, which resulted 
in easy baskets. Of the Trojans' 18 baskets in the second half, they had six 
layups and five shots inside the key. 
</P>
<P>
"I told our kids that we had no chance to win unless we got some easy baskets 
and the best way for us to get easy baskets was for us to run on them," 
Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
USC (4-1) has won three games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Playing before a standing-room- only crowd of 9,386 at Moby Arena, where the 
Rams had won 18 of 19 nonconference games since Grant took over in 1988, 
Colorado State wore gold uniforms for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
But the Trojans weren't intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Rams-head sign that lights up and snorts smoke when the crowd 
screams loud enough to ignite it didn't get much use Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we struggled in situations like this," Raveling said. "Any time 
you beat a Boyd Grant-coached team you've got to feel proud. This should do a 
lot for our confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Leading 69-58 after Miner dunked with 1:08 left, the Trojans maintained their 
composure down the stretch to hand Colorado State its first loss in five games 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best team talent-wise that USC has had for a while," Grant said. 
"They're really quick." 
</P>
<P>
USC used its quickness to force Colorado State guards Mark Meredith, Lynn Tryon 
and Wayne Gipson to shoot from outside their normal range. Meredith missed 10 
of 15 shots, Tryon missed 12 of 19 and Gipson missed four of five. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting 44.8% in the first half, which ended in a 28-28 tie, the Rams 
shot 40.5% in the second half and were outscored, 46-39. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC forward Ronnie Coleman passed Gus Williams to move into fifth place on the 
school career scoring list with 1,322 points. Williams had 1,318 points. The 
Trojans will play Notre Dame at South Bend, Ind., Wednesday night. . . . 
Colorado State made a season-low 42.4% of its shots.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL NCAA REGIONAL; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA RETAINS MASTERY OF STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saturday night's match between top-ranked UCLA and No. 3 Stanford could well 
have been played for the national championship, had regional scheduling 
cooperated. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't, and Stanford will have to try again next season. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Bruins, utilizing the balance and consistency that has become 
their trademark, pounded away methodically at the Cardinal, winning the West 
Region in three games, 15-10, 15-8, 15-12, before 2,250 at UCLA's Wooden 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
For Stanford (27-4), the frustration continues against the Bruins, who are 3-0 
against the Cardinal this season and 24-9 overall -- including the last eight 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins (34-1), who will meet Louisiana State in the Final Four semifinal 
next Thursday in College Park, Md., have now won three consecutive NCAA 
regional finals and are 7-1 in regional finals play. 
</P>
<P>
"We were put in a tough situation," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said of his team's 
placement in the West along with the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we have two of the top three teams in the nation and we have to play in 
this situation." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Andy Banachowski agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Stanford is probably the most underrated team in the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've thought all along that they should be No. 2. (Saturday night) was a good 
example of high-quality volleyball and it's a shame the whole country won't be 
able to see it." 
</P>
<P>
After a fairly close -- and lengthy -- first game, it was clear that the 
Cardinal was indeed a tough situation. A tough serving game and the setting of 
Holly McPeak served to take the Cardinal out of its offense. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a long game, but we gave them too many contact points," Shaw said. 
"That kept them in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but McPeak had 61 assists and did an excellent job of reading 
Stanford's blockers, and providing for a balanced offensive attack from all 
areas of the court in all three games. 
</P>
<P>
"Their outside blockers were cheating in, so I tried to set a lot of flares and 
run more to the right side to avoid Bev (Oden) and Jessica (Benton)," McPeak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She was successful as Oden, the Pacific 10 Conference player of the year, was 
largely kept out of the game with only 18 kills, a team high but well below her 
usual performance. Benton finished with 10 kills. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA didn't really take me out of the game," Oden said. "They did a good job 
blocking everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Four Bruins were in double figures in kills, with Natalie Williams leading the 
way with 26.

TAR HEELS STILL DO IT DEAN SMITH'S WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN DAVIS, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 28 years directing the University of North Carolina basketball program, 
Dean Smith hasn't changed one bit. Smith can still selectively recruit a top 
prospect, then spend three years downplaying that player's abilities until he 
acquires Smith's favorite characteristic: "senior leadership." 
</P>
<P>
When you've been as successful as Smith has been, there isn't much reason to 
change. Especially not this season. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's 10th-ranked Tar Heels, who take a 3-1 record into Thursday night's Big 
East-Atlantic Coast Conference Challenge game against the University of 
Connecticut in Chapel Hill, N.C., have one of the most heralded freshman 
classes in college basketball history. With Eric Montross, Derrick Phelps, 
Brian Reese, Clifford Rozier and Pat Sullivan, Smith could start an 
all-freshman team and the Tar Heels might still be a Final Four contender. 
</P>
<P>
Rozier, Montross and Reese were among the consensus top 10 high school players 
in the country last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing I know about their freshmen is that they're all great," UConn 
Coach Jim Calhoun said. "Sometimes kids come out of nowhere, because you don't 
see them (during recruiting). Most of their freshmen have been very visible at 
Nike camp or AAU tournaments. They have, arguably, one of the best recruiting 
classes in the last decade, if not among the top five or six in recent memory." 
</P>
<P>
But even if it seemed Smith had to start five freshmen, he wouldn't do it. At 
North Carolina, you learn the Smith system first -- even if your name is 
Michael Jordan or James Worthy. 
</P>
<P>
Smith doesn't even like talking about his freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing happened when we first scrimmaged the freshmen and the guys 
coming back won by 57 points," Smith said recently. "That kind of woke up the 
freshmen and made them realize they had a lot to do." 
</P>
<P>
Carolina's veterans include some of the top players in the ACC: Pete Chilcutt, 
George Lynch, Rick Fox, King Rice. Smith will not push them aside for the 
freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Our freshmen have gotten entirely too much attention," Smith said. "I think 
they're outstanding prospects, but if we bring in three one year and two 
another year, we wouldn't have this (hype). For some reason, it has really gone 
overboard. And yet the nice thing about it is they are intelligent and they 
know they're not quite ready. They're not expecting a great deal of playing 
time. It could be difficult otherwise. They have come in and contributed and 
we're certainly happy we have them. But I never dreamed it would be like this." 
</P>
<P>
Although Carolina's youth gives Smith reason to keep expectations down, the 
pedigrees of the new Tar Heels have pushed Smith's team back to the forefront 
of the ACC. The challenge for Smith is to find the right chemistry between old 
and new. 
</P>
<P>
But that's the reason Smith designed his system in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been a problem," Rice, Carolina's senior point guard, said of 
finding the right mix. "We're a close team. We don't pay too much attention to 
what the media says. The new guys on the team know who the main guys are and 
they're just trying to improve. They realize they have a lot to work on and 
improve on. They're good to be around but I think they realize they need us to 
become better players and for the team to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Our freshmen want to play more but they realize that it's different playing 
here than anyplace else. They have to do it at both ends of the floor and do 
some things they probably wouldn't be asked to do at other schools." 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina freshmen carry the team's equipment when the Tar Heels go on the 
road. They must learn to acknowledge the player who made the assist after every 
score, be supportive on the bench, play defense, and acquire a sense of 
loyalty. And there never are any promises of starting as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get to practice, he's on the freshmen more than other coaches 
probably are," Rice said. "You have to do it on the defensive end and when you 
come out of high school many guys aren't really good defensive players. You 
have a lot to learn. You don't get thrown into the battles until you know how 
to play defense." 
</P>
<P>
Why does Smith shield his freshmen from the outside, yet push them so hard 
himself? To make them better players, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just seen so many high school guys with great reputations fail to live up 
to it," Smith said. "They don't need this additional pressure which is coming 
their way just because all five are coming to Chapel Hill in the same year." 
</P>
<P>
It's a tribute to Smith's program the Tar Heels were considered to be down last 
season when they went 21-13. Carolina has at least 21 victories every season 
for 20 consecutive years, and the Tar Heels have reached the Sweet 16 of the 
NCAA Tournament 10 consecutive seasons. Smith has taken North Carolina to the 
Final Four seven times and won the national championship in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in the past four or five seasons, it has been said that Smith has lost his 
grip on the ACC to Duke and Coach Mike Krzyzewski. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we beat Duke pretty badly both times (79-60 and 87-75) we played 
them," Rice said. "Duke is a great team but I feel when we play head-to-head we 
usually come out pretty well. We're not going to get caught up in that. We 
still feel we're one of the top teams in the country." 
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels have achieved success while upholding a clean reputation. 
Carolina's basketball guide notes 175 of Smith's 179 lettermen have graduated. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Smith was the main reason I came here," said Rice, who grew up in 
Binghamton, N.Y., an hour from Syracuse's Carrier Dome. "He didn't make any 
promises except that I would graduate from college on time. I liked that. He 
didn't tell me I would be starting or make all those other promises. He was 
just straightforward with me." 
</P>
<P>
Montross, Phelps, Reese, Rozier and Sullivan all heard the same promise. After 
30 years, why should Smith alter his best recruiting pitch? 
</P>
<P>
"If you look for a blueprint in college athletics," Calhoun said, "Dean Smith's 
program might be pretty close to that blueprint. A lot of coaches would say 
it's the way to get it done. They treat their kids with respect, their kids 
conduct themselves the way they're supposed to on and off the court. They run a 
first-rate program. It's not perfect; no program is. But it's close to the 
epitome for what college basketball can and should be."

SMALL'S FEAT HELPS TITANS BEAT PEPPERDINE; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: SHOOTING GUARD ENDS HIS SLUMP WITH 27 POINTS TO HELP FULLERTON WIN 
ON ROAD AGAIN.

<P>
When Pepperdine wiped out Cal State Fullerton's 14-point lead and went ahead in 
the second half, Joe Small stepped up and swished a three-point basket, and 
then another. 
</P>
<P>
When Pepperdine rallied again to force overtime, Small made a jumper, then two 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
With 27 points, Small made sure Fullerton didn't let Saturday night's game in 
front of 1,729 slip away at Firestone Fieldhouse. His 17-point second half led 
the Titans to a 69-66 overtime victory over Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
"One of us was going to have to step up," Small said. "Why not me?" 
</P>
<P>
Going into the game, Small was mired in a shooting slump. He had made only 
40.8% of his shots from the field, not a pleasing percentage for a shooting 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
But he kept firing Saturday, making 11 of 20, including three of seven from 
three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Small said his confidence swelled after making his first few jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to be a good shooting night," he said. "I just got in a 
zone." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time since the 1988-89 season, John Sneed's first as coach, 
that the Titans won two straight road games. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, it appeared the Titans (3-2) were headed for the second 
consecutive easy road victory. They routed the University of San Francisco, 
84-60, Wednesday in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
With Small leading the way, Fullerton built a 48-34 lead with 15:56 left in the 
game. But suddenly Pepperdine, which had clanged all sorts of shots off the 
backboard and rim until then, got hot. 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Lear dunked, Dana Jones made a layup off an underhand flip from Lear and 
Steve Guild made a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly it was 48-41, Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
After a timeout, Damin Lopez made a three-pointer for Pepperdine, Lear and 
Jones scored and it was 48-48. Lopez made one of two free throws, then Jones 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
And Fullerton was fading fast. 
</P>
<P>
"That one spell hurt us," Sneed said. "We were tentative against their zone 
press. We attacked the press and were fine after that. I was proud the guys 
didn't fold." 
</P>
<P>
Small's back-to-back three-pointers were crucial in keeping the Titans afloat. 
</P>
<P>
His first came with 8:26 left, breaking a 17-0 Pepperdine run. The second, a 
moment later, put Fullerton back into the lead, 54-51. 
</P>
<P>
Later, with a chance to win in regulation, Fullerton's Wayne Williams, had the 
ball stolen by Rick Welch with three seconds left. Welch's half-court throw was 
wide right at the buzzer and the teams went to overtime tied, 61-61. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Christie made two free throws to give Pepperdine the lead. At the other 
end, Small and made a 17-footer at the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
Williams made two free throws a moment later, Small added two, and Williams two 
more as Fullerton hung on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
So what does this mean for the Titans? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Pepperdine (4-2) had already beaten two other Big West Conference teams 
-- blitzing Fresno State, 84-64, in Fresno and knocking off UC Santa Barbara, 
72-60. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to come around," Sneed said. "We beat a pretty good team 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Said Small: "We feel real confident right now. We're on a high." 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Wilhite, who made six of seven shots from the field before fouling out, 
was the only other Titan in double figures. He had 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Lear led Pepperdine with 18 points. Guild, a former standout at Marina High 
School, had 13, and Christie, playing with a sprained ankle, had 11. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine shot just 34.4% from the field to Fullerton's 44.3.

Senior fullback Ray Whalen scored three touchdowns, including the winner in the 
third overtime, to lead Nevada to a 59-52 victory over Boise State in the NCAA 
I-AA semifinals Saturday at Reno. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Wolf Pack's second triple-overtime victory in two weeks. Nevada 
defeated Furman, 42-35, last week in identical overtime scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada (13-1) will face defending champion Georgia Southern next Saturday in 
Statesboro, Ga. Nevada's only loss this season was a 30-14 setback to Boise 
State (10-4). 
</P>
<P>
Whalen, who didn't play the previous game against Boise State, rushed for 245 
yards and a school-record 44 carries Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Nevada outscored Boise State, 22-17, but allowed the 
Broncos to score the tying touchdown with 59 seconds remaining in regulation. 
The seven-yard pass from Mike Verdin to Ryan Tell sent the game into overtime 
knotted at 45. 
</P>
<P>
In the overtime, each team gets a chance to score from the opponent's 25-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams missed field goals in the first overtime. Boise went ahead on a 
one-yard run in the second overtime, but Nevada tied it at 52 on an eight-yard 
pass from freshman Chris Vargas to Scott Benning. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Southern 44, Central Florida 7 -- Raymond Gross passed for 159 yards 
and two touchdowns and Joe Ross opened a 35-point second half with a 55-yard 
touchdown run as Georgia Southern (11-3) crushed Central Florida (10-4) at 
Statesboro to advance to the I-AA championship game for the fifth time in six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NCAA DIVISION II 
</P>
<P>
North Dakota State 51, Indiana (Pa.) 11 -- Chris Simdorn accounted for 324 
yards and five touchdowns as North Dakota State romped to its fifth Division II 
championship in eight years, defeating Indiana at Florence, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
North Dakota State completed the 11th perfect season in school history at 14-0. 
Indiana, which also lost to the Bison during the regular season, finished 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
Simdorn, who was awarded the Harlon Hill Trophy as the top player in Division 
II on Friday night, directed the Bison's devastating veer offense to 627 yards 
-- including 448 on the ground. He rushed for 145 yards and two touchdowns and 
completed four of eight passes for 179 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Satter, who ran for 174 yards in 12 carries, capped the third-quarter 
outburst with a 66-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NCAA DIVISION III 
</P>
<P>
Allegheny 21, Lycoming 14 -- Jeff Filkovski threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to 
Kurt Reiser in overtime as Allegheny College beat Lycoming in a battle of 
Pennsylvania schools at Bradenton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Allegheny (13-0-1) rallied from a 14-0 deficit to tie the score on Filkovski's 
seven-yard touchdown pass to Julio Lacaya with 1:38 remaining in regulation. 
Lycoming finished at 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NAIA DIVISION I 
</P>
<P>
Central State 38, Mesa State 16 -- Tailback Ray Hill scored two touchdowns, one 
a 79-yard run, and rushed for 208 yards as Central State of Ohio (10-1) won its 
first NAIA championship by defeating Mesa State of Colorado at Grand Junction, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa State (9-4) played without national rushing leader Marlo Johnson, who was 
suspended after being arrested in Conway, Ark., for allegedly breaking a fan's 
jaw with his helmet.

DO THE HOYAS REALLY HAVE WHAT IT TAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON EISENBERG, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ACC-Big East Challenge is a made-for-television festival of dunks that 
proves little, but it does serve a purpose as college basketball's version of 
Cliffs Notes. You pay attention for a couple of nights and, presto, you're an 
Instant Expert, with a read on a number of teams that will be littered through 
the rankings this winter. 
</P>
<P>
We know now, for instance, that Georgia Tech's Kenny Anderson is going to 
struggle to shine as brightly without all-star teammates. We know that Bryant 
Stith of Virginia and Malik Sealy of St. John's are among the game's best 
unknown players. We know that Syracuse runs only six-deep when pressed by a 
decent opponent. 
</P>
<P>
We also know Georgetown again has a team that does justice to its name. The 
Hoyas beat a capable Duke team earlier this week at the Capital Centre, and did 
it with their customary blend of defense and muscle. They're unbeaten, ranked 
sixth in the country and, no doubt, strike fear in the hearts of basketball 
Joneses throughout the land. 
</P>
<P>
But here is an opinion: If the Hoyas are the sixth-best team in the country, 
the general quality of college basketball is dropping. John Thompson's team 
does have Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo inside, and that's a lot, but it 
also is a painfully young team, with three freshman starters, and lacks depth. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoyas proved capable against Duke before a supportive, electric crowd, but 
written all over them are the markings of a team that will struggle away from 
home -- and in the NCAA tournament. It would not be the first time. The Hoyas 
have not made the Final Four since 1985. Perhaps it is time to examine how much 
of their legend is the result of mythmaking. 
</P>
<P>
Since that fateful night when Villanova upset them in the 1984-85 championship 
game, the Hoyas have returned to the tournament every year, but advanced beyond 
the second round only twice. They've been knocked out by Xavier, Temple, 
Michigan State. The two times they advanced to a regional final, they were 
soundly beaten, by Providence and Duke. 
</P>
<P>
This is a team that, since Patrick Ewing left, has not recruited a single 
player who has had any impact in the NBA. Mourning and probably Mutombo will 
soon change that, but don't mistake the point: The Hoyas are no talent factory. 
The plain fact is that Thompson has not fared particularly well as a recruiter. 
Blue-chip players go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
One would think that, with the legend Thompson has built, he could choose among 
blue-chippers. But he is a stubborn man, as he readily admits, and he long ago 
decided that begging for recruits was demeaning. So he just doesn't do it. If 
they don't want him, forget them; he isn't going to ask. He isn't necessarily 
wrong. But there is a reason for those NCAA losses. 
</P>
<P>
It also is a fact that other coaches use Thompson's style of basketball to 
recruit against him. He preaches defense and a no-star system, and he's won 
more than 400 games. But the college game is changing, becoming more offensive, 
a run-and-gun game of three-pointers. UNLV plays pressure defense, but runs it 
up, too. Offense always seems almost an afterthought to the Hoyas. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, Thompson stands out as a defensive coach in an offensive game, a 
tad out of touch. Other coaches tell recruits they'll have more fun playing if 
they don't go to Georgetown. Walt Williams chose Maryland over Georgetown in 
part because he wanted to play more than 25 minutes a game and average more 
than 10 or 12 points. It is an oft-told story these days. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, again, refuses to change. And, again, he isn't wrong. It's hard to 
argue with a coach who has won at least 20 games every season since 1978. But, 
at the same time, as top recruits continue to line up at Arizona and North 
Carolina and Arkansas and points elsewhere, it seems fair to submit that the 
Hoyas' man-eating legend is a bit dated. 
</P>
<P>
For all his success, Thompson has never taken a Ewing-less team to the Final 
Four. That's a high standard by which to judge, but it's fair: Thompson has 
long recruited with the kind of name identification that other coaches only 
dream about. He hasn't made the most of it. Maybe this is the season, but don't 
count on it. Teams with all-freshman backcourts rarely wind up making 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
Please understand that this is by no means a plea for the man's head. Thompson 
is a man of high principle in a game that has precious few. Sixty-one of his 63 
four-year players have earned their degrees. In that respect, he wins the Final 
Four every year. 
</P>
<P>
It is his stubbornness that has enabled him to succeed for so long on and off 
the court, doing it his way in the face of many detractors. But such innate 
stubbornness does not wax and wane. Those around him -- and in the stands -- 
simply must live with it, accepting the consequences that disappoint them as 
well as the consequences they cheer and admire.

CANLEY'S FIVE TOUCHDOWNS POWER SAN JOSE STATE;

Sheldon Canley scored a California Bowl-record five touchdowns, one on a 
59-yard run, as San Jose State scored a 48-24 victory over Central Michigan 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Big West-champion Spartans led, 26-10, in the third quarter when Canley 
broke through the line, cut to the left and back to the center of the field 
around several defenders for the touchdown that put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
Canley then broke the California Bowl record of three touchdowns on a five-yard 
run and caught a touchdown pass from Ralph Martini early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose Coach Terry Shea said opponents give Canley, a 5-foot-8 tailback 
chosen as a third-team All-American by the Associated Press, "tremendous 
respect . . . for his style and what he puts into the game. It's unparalleled 
in college football today. 
</P>
<P>
"Some backs may have more glamour and more stats, but not the heart," Shea 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chippewas (8-3-1), champions of the Mid-American Conference, got a bad 
break when Canley swept around the right side for a five-yard touchdown on the 
Spartans' first possession. Replays showed Canley stepped out of bounds on the 
two, but the touchdown stood. 
</P>
<P>
After a field goal early in the second quarter gave the Spartans (9-2-1) a 10-0 
lead, Central Michigan's Jeff Bender passed to Ken Ealy running down the left 
sideline for a 55-yard touchdown. Ealy had two more touchdown receptions in the 
second half after the game was out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
Canley took the opening kickoff but fumbled when he was hit by Todd Reynolds, 
and the Chippewas recovered at the San Jose State 14. On fourth-and-one at the 
five, Central Michigan went for the first down -- but Billy Smith was thrown 
for a one-yard loss, and the momentum shifted to the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
Canley slipped around several defenders on the right side for a 22-yard 
touchdown set up by a 40-yard pass from Martini to Gary Charlton later in the 
second quarter for a 17-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Canley finished with 164 yards in 23 carries and added 44 yards on five 
receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Martini finished with 27 completions in 36 attempts for 404 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Bender passed for 220 yards on 14 completions in 25 attempts. Ealy caught seven 
passes for 161 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Central Michigan Coach Herb Deromedi said the Spartans were simply too fast. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the fastest football team I've had the opportunity to coach against," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked extremely hard to get to this level. But on this given day, we just 
played an outstanding team."

CANADIENS PROVE TO BE PRODIGIES, BEAT BRUINS, 7-1

The young Montreal Canadiens are learning rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Stephan Lebeau had a goal and two assists Saturday night at Montreal, leading 
the Canadiens to a 7-1 victory over the Boston Bruins that completed a 
home-and-home sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Lebeau, a 22-year-old center in his second season in the NHL, also had a key 
goal during the Canadiens' 6-4 victory in Boston Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The sweep lifted the Canadiens into first place in the Adams Division and 
belied Coach Pat Burns' prediction that inexperience would hold back his team 
for at least half a season. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a young team, " Burns said recently, "that we have to spend many 
hours teaching and coaching. Don't expect us to do too well until the second 
half of the season." 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens have won three in a row since Burns made the comment. 
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday's game the Canadiens, the worst power-play team in the league, 
had only 13 goals in 132 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
After getting two power-play goals Wednesday, they scored their first two goals 
with a man advantage in this one. They scored three times in their first seven 
shots at goalie Andy Moog, who left after a period trailing, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 2, Toronto 1 -- Steve Larmer might be as good a two-way player as there 
is in hockey. He is a major reason why the Blackhawks lead the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
Larmer is the team's leading scorer and is a key member of the penalty-killing 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Larmer, who had two goals and three assists in a victory Thursday night, scored 
the winning goal in the second period at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 2, Detroit 1 -- Rich Sutter proved too much for the Red Wings again 
at St. Louis as the Blues swept a home-and-home series. 
</P>
<P>
Sutter, who scored twice Friday night to lead the Blues to a 6-3 victory at 
Detroit, scored the decisive goal in the last minute of the second period in 
this one. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 7, Philadelphia 0 -- Brian Propp came back to haunt his former 
teammates in this game at Bloomington, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Propp, who spent seven seasons with the Flyers, had a goal and an assist in a 
three-goal first period that made it easy for goalie Brian Hayward. Hayward had 
22 saves in his first shutout for the North Stars. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 3, Pittsburgh 1 -- The Whalers finally put an end to their slump on 
home ice. Adam Burt, called up from the minors earlier in the day, scored the 
tiebreaking goal early in the third period and the Whalers ended a five-game 
home winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 4, Washington 2 -- The Devils' Brendan Shanahan had a goal and set 
up two others at East Rutherford, N.J. The Devils took advantage of sloppy 
defense to get a split in the home-and-home series. DAN HAFNER

During the second half of the Southern Section Division IX championship game, 
Whittier Christian High School went into a different sort of prevent defense. 
</P>
<P>
Call it: Prevent Tehachapi running back Eric Young from scoring. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't perfect -- Young rushed for 182 yards and one touchdown -- but 
Whittier Christian slowed him enough to beat Tehachapi, 34-21, and win the 
Division IX title Saturday in front of about 4,500 at Bakersfield College. 
</P>
<P>
It was Whittier Christian's first appearance in a Southern Section final since 
1984, when the Heralds won their second consecutive Inland Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
The Heralds (13-0) won with a combination of nearly mistake-free ball-control 
offense and opportunistic defense. Whittier Christian had no turnovers, but 
forced three Tehachapi turnovers, each of which led to Whittier Christian 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
This championship, the first under Coach Phil Bravo, was won convincingly in 
the second half after Tehachapi (12-2) rallied to tie the score, 14-14, in the 
last minute of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Tehachapi quarterback Ryan Grimes threw two touchdown passes in the first half 
after Whittier Christian took a 14-0 lead on a one-yard run by Rex Pritchard 
and a 49-yard touchdown pass from Nick Sanchez to Dave Whitby. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Young, who has rushed for more than 2,000 yards this season, who was 
the heart of the Warriors' offense. 
</P>
<P>
Young set up Tehachapi's first touchdown with a 60-yard run, and in the second 
half, was the only Warrior to gain yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Young's 182 yards came in 30 carries but the Warriors' offense was so 
one-dimensional in the second half -- he carried on 19 on their 24 second-half 
plays -- that Whittier Christian was able key on him. 
</P>
<P>
Still Tehachapi stayed with the Heralds, tying the score, 21-21, with 3 minutes 
7 seconds remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Whittier Christian took a 27-21 lead at the end of the third quarter and 
then forced Tehachapi to punt. And that's all the Heralds needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll beat you if you punt a few times," Bravo said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually it was an interception by Whitby, his ninth of the season, that broke 
up Tehachapi's final drive and led to the Heralds' final touchdown drive. 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't score, fullback Ron Rector provided 82 yards in 17 carries 
for the Heralds. Pritchard rushed 14 times for 65 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The teams agreed to play at Bakersfield College instead of Tehachapi. Whittier 
Christian payed the difference -- about $2,000 -- between what it would have 
cost to play the game on the Warriors' home field. 
</P>
<P>
"This meant a lot to me," said Bravo, who was an assistant on the Heralds' two 
championship teams. "The was the year we weren't supposed to do anything yet, 
14 weeks later here we are. We go 300 miles round trip to win the 
championship."

SOLLIDAY MAKES MOST OF SECOND CHANCE WITH VICTORY

<P>
Tony Solliday got a chance to rewrite an ending Saturday night. He got to do it 
all over again and, this time, Capistrano Valley High School got to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Solliday drove the Cougars to a game-winning field goal and the Southern 
Section Division II championship at Santa Ana Stadium. He took the Cougars 81 
yards in the final two minutes to set up a Tomek Mikler field goal for a 17-15 
victory over Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
"This erases everything from last year," Solliday said. "Everything." 
</P>
<P>
Solliday has waited that long for another chance. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Cougars faced Paramount in the semifinals of the Division III 
playoffs and trailed, 28-21, with four minutes left. Solliday drove the Cougars 
63 yards for the tying touchdown with 21 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
But Paramount pulled out a 36-35 victory with a touchdown and two-point 
conversion in overtime. Solliday could only stand on the sideline and watch as 
the Cougars' season ended. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate it when the defense is on the field," said Solliday who completed nine 
of 18 passes for 161 yards and two touchdowns. "Everything is out of my hands. 
When I'm on the field, I'm in control." 
</P>
<P>
Solliday took control Saturday with 2:11 left and the Cougars on their 12, 
15-14. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play, Solliday threw a four-yard pass to Brian Peterson, who then 
pitched the ball to Jeremy Brion. The play gained 19 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I dropped that pass in practice the other day," Peterson said. "But Tony kept 
me calm in the huddle. He was a pro on the drive." 
</P>
<P>
Solliday completed three of five passes for 44 yards on the drive. He also 
scrambled twice for 11 yards. 
</P>
<P>
On third and six at the Paramount 36, Solliday lofted a deep pass to Scott 
Patton, who was hit before the ball arrived. The pass interference call gave 
the Cougars a first down on the 21. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cougar Coach Eric Patton: "Before the play, Tony came to the sideline and 
said, 'I want to throw deep to Scott, and it's going to work and we're all 
going to go home happy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Four plays after the penalty, Mikler made a 22-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was going to get a chance to win the game," Solliday said. "I did it 
against them last year, I knew I could do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Only this time, it was the right ending.

Solid first-quarter play and execution helped Tustin High School defeat Marina, 
67-50, for the title in the second Trabuco Hills High School basketball 
tournament Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin (4-0), led by David Beilstein's 22 points, took an 18-4 lead with 2:11 
left in the first quarter and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
Beilstein shared co-most valuable player honors with Cherokee Parks of Marina. 
</P>
<P>
"We played solid man-to-man defense and double-teamed Parks down at the post," 
Tustin Coach Tom McCluskey said. "We played relaxed, we concentrated on what we 
wanted to do and we executed well." 
</P>
<P>
Parks, who scored 34 points for Marina (3-2), made two free throws with 6:49 
left to cut Tustin's lead to 11 points, 52-41. 
</P>
<P>
In the Trabuco Hills Tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 56, Mater Dei 55 -- In the fifth-place game, Los Alamitos (4-2) 
handed the Monarchs their second loss in the past three games and second in the 
past 30.

Capistrano Valley 71, J.W. North 57 -- Tom Airey scored 10 of his 19 points in 
the fourth quarter to lead Capistrano Valley. Brett McCorkle scored 21 points

QUINTANA PERFECT WITH NATIONAL TITLE

<P>
Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande completed an undefeated cross-country season by 
winning the 12th annual Kinney national championship Saturday at Balboa Park in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Quintana, a senior who finished third in last year's final, ran the 5,000-meter 
course in 15 minutes 7.22 seconds. He trailed early but rallied after the first 
mile to pull ahead of Jason Casiano of Portage, Ind., who finished second with 
a time of 15:17.16. 
</P>
<P>
"I made my move when we started going up the hill," Quintana said. "After we 
got over the hill, the field started coming back to me and I found myself on 
top. I then tried to work the downhill to the best of my ability." 
</P>
<P>
David Hartman of Canyon Country Canyon, who placed third in 15:20.96, said the 
fast early pace in the heat caught him by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"They went out so hard I had to catch up," said Hartman, who was in 11th place 
after two miles. "It was a little hot, but I was able to work the hill and make 
my move near the end." 
</P>
<P>
Other local finishers included James Menon of San Luis Obispo, who finished 
ninth in 15:33.07, and Angel Martinez of San Gabriel, who finished 16th in 
15:43.44. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, Melody Fairchild of Boulder, Colo., won the 
girls' championship. Fairchild's time of 16:39.26 broke the meet record of 
16:40 set by Connie Jo Robinson of Cincinnati in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Rothman of Westlake Village was a surprise second-place finisher in 
17:38.36. Veronica Barajas of Channel Islands finished fifth in 17:47.50, and 
Deena Drossin of Agoura, who won the West regionals last week, finished sixth 
in 17:53.07. 
</P>
<P>
"This feels great because it's my first win over Deena in my life," said 
Rothman, who finished second to Drossin in the West regional.

Whittier Christian 34, Tehachapi 21 -- Whittier Christian's defense slowed 
Tehachapi just enough to pull out a victory in Bakersfield.

<P>
Whittier Christian (13-0) had no turnovers and forced Tehachapi (12-2) into 
three turnovers, each leading to a touchdown. 
</P>

Herald tailback Rex Pritchard rushed for a touchdown in each half, quarterback 
Nick Sanchez threw a 49-yard touchdown pass and ran for a four-yard score, and

SMITH CARRIES ESPERANZA PAST ST. PAUL

Running back Jarod Smith ran for three second-half touchdowns and a two-point 
conversion to lead Anaheim Esperanza to a 25-7 victory over St. Paul in the 
Southern Section Division III championship game Saturday night at Cerritos 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who had 46 yards in 11 carries, scored on runs of five, 16 and two yards 
as the Aztecs (14-0) capped the first perfect season in school history. It was 
their first section title since 1979. They lost in the finals in 1980, '82 and 
'84. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul (8-4-2) held a 7-3 lead when defensive back David Toruno apparently 
suffered a broken leg while breaking up a pass in the end zone with 2:22 to 
play in the third quarter. The game was stopped for 15 minutes while officials 
waited for paramedics to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays after play resumed, Smith scored from the five to give Esperanza a 
10-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Smith scored his second touchdown on a 16-yard run around the right side with 
eight minutes to play, then ran in the two-point conversion to make the score 
18-3. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown was set up by Esperanza back Mark Parlin, who intercepted a pass 
by Al Borunda at the St. Paul 29 and returned it to the 16. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's third touchdown, with 3:57 to play, also was set up by an interception, 
by Derrick Reaves at the Esperanza 46. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza opened the scoring late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs took the ball at the Swordsmen 26 with 39 seconds to play after a 
21-yard punt by Matt Lenzen. A pass interference call and a 13-yard pass from 
Keith McDonald to Marcus Tayui gave Esperanza a first-and-goal at the eight 
with 20 seconds to play. After two incomplete passes, Clay King kicked a 
25-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul took a 7-3 lead on the first possession of the second half on Shawn 
McKinney's 29-yard touchdown run.

CAPISTRANO VALLEY WINS TITLE, 17-15 
</P>

Tomek Mikler kicked a 22-yard field goal with 16 seconds remaining Saturday 
night to give Capistrano Valley a 17-15 victory over Paramount in the Southern 
Section Division II championship game at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was Capistrano Valley's first championship since 1980, when the Cougars 
defeated Esperanza for the Central Conference title. The loss ended Paramount's 
21-game winning streak, which had been the longest in the Southern Section. The 
Pirates also were the two-time defending Division III champions. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount (13-1) appeared as if it would make it three consecutive titles when 
-- with the Pirates leading, 15-14 -- Leon Neal ran nine yards for an apparent 
touchdown on fourth down with 2:16 left in the game. But Paramount was called 
for holding on the play and the Pirates were unable to convert on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (12-2) took over at its 12-yard line with 2:11 left and drove 
to the Pirates' 17. Mikler came in to attempt a 27-yard field goal, but 
Paramount was called for offsides, giving Mikler a 22-yard attempt. The kick 
was right down the middle, leaving most of the 10,000 in a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
"That extra five yards really helped," said Mikler, a senior. "I thought that 
this game might come down to me, and I was ready." 
</P>
<P>
Mikler was put in position for the winning field goal because of some fine 
passing by senior quarterback Tony Solliday. Solliday, who completed nine of 19 
passes for 143 yards and two touchdowns, completed three passes in the drive 
and rushed for seven yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I love being in the position I was put in," Solliday said. "I'd rather be on 
the field, able to control my destiny than watching the outcome from the 
sidelines. This is really a great feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley led, 14-3, at halftime after Solliday connected with Jeremy 
Brion on a 74-yard touchdown pass play in the first quarter and with Dave Poltl 
on an eight-yard scoring pass with 21 seconds remaining in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount came out strong in the second half behind the rushing of Neal, De 
Mondre White and Rolando Avila. Neal finished with 147 yards, White added 68 
and Avila scored on a pair of two-yard touchdown runs to put the Pirates ahead, 
15-14, with 9:21 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Coach Ken Sutch said he would have gone for the field goal late in 
the fourth quarter, but kicker Alphonso Bigelow suffered what is believed to be 
a broken ankle playing tight end late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount controlled the ball for most of the first half, running 34 plays 
compared to 18 for Capistrano Valley.

GREYDAR WINS AFFIRMED -- BARELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Wayne Lukas is right, Greydar might become an extremely important horse in 
the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this horse could be another Criminal Type," the trainer said after 
Greydar ran down Lee's Tanthem to win the $108,900 Affirmed Handicap Saturday 
at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
This is a mouthful considering Criminal Type's accomplishments in 1990. He beat 
Sunday Silence in the Hollywood Gold Cup, Easy Goer and Housebuster in the 
Metropolitan Mile and picked up other assorted stakes victories before he was 
retired because of injury. The Alydar horse is a leading candidate for Horse of 
the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Greydar is also a Calumet Farm-owned son of Alydar, but, in some ways, he is 
way ahead of Criminal Type. He is a stakes-winner at 3; Criminal Type didn't 
come into his own until after his fifth birthday. 
</P>
<P>
In winning for the fourth time in 12 starts, the 5-2 second choice was helped 
most when post positions for the one-mile Affirmed were drawn Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He drew the outside in the field of seven, and that is the place to be for a 
one-turn mile at Hollywood Park. In his previous race, he was stuck on the rail 
and finished far back at the even-money favorite. In the first 25 days of the 
meeting, only two horses have won from the rail going a mile. 
</P>
<P>
"Was it ever good to get this horse off the rail," Luka said. "This horse likes 
the outside, anyhow. He's run his best races out there. The problem from the 
inside was that Gary (Stevens) had to ride him every step of the way, and when 
they get here (Lukas gestured toward the stretch), they're just empty. He got a 
perfect trip today." 
</P>
<P>
With anything less than that type of journey, Greydar wouldn't have been able 
to catch Lee's Tanthem. 
</P>
<P>
A winner of six of his previous seven races at four tracks in Northern 
California, the 7-1 shot showed the way with some fast fractions (22 1/5, 44 
2/5, 1:08 1/5 and 1:20 2/5) and it wasn't until the final strides that he was 
caught. The final time was 1:33 2/5, the quickest mile at Hollywood Park this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a nice little horse," jockey Roberto Gonzalez said of the runner-up. 
"I didn't want to be on the lead, but he moved up so nice and easy I felt we 
should go on with it. He gave me everything he had today." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, who has ridden Greydar to all three of his victories in California, 
thinks the roan's best days are ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really improving," he said. "He's getting better and better. He's still 
very green mentally, but physically he's matured (since Del Mar). He's widened 
out through the chest. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to the gate 100% better than he used to. He's not a good stick 
(whip) horse. You could tell I wasn't getting into him down the lane because 
he's the type of horse who will sulk if you hit him. 
</P>
<P>
"His last race we were locked down on the rail the entire way. When I saw we 
drew the outside today, I liked his chances a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive Play, who was making his first start on dirt, was third, 
three-quarters of a length behind Lee's Tanthem. He will be more comfortable 
with additional distance. 
</P>
<P>
"He's too big," jockey Jose Santos said. "The 1:33 and change was too fast for 
him. He was coming on at the end, but the race was too fast and we ran out of 
track." 
</P>
<P>
Individualist, who had upset older horses in the On Trust Handicap Nov. 22, was 
sixth as the 5-2 favorite and never posed a threat. 
</P>
<P>
Sensational Star, who dropped into a $40,000 claiming race Saturday after 
winning or placing in five consecutive stakes, won as the 4-5 favorite, but he 
drifted out through the stretch and was fully extended to beat Avasaurus by 
three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
There were no claims for the 6-year-old Inherent Star gelding, who has earned 
more than $442,000. Sensational Star's final time of 1:21 2/5 equaled the 
fastest seven furlongs of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Besides winning the Affirmed, Wayne Lukas and Calumet Farm also won the $75,000 
added Gallant Fox Handicap at Aqueduct with Power Lunch. Lively One, the 6-5 
favorite in the 1 5/8-mile race, finished ninth. . . . Laffit Pincay, who has 
been idle since suffering a broken right collarbone Nov. 8 in a post-race 
accident, will ride Advocate Training in today's third race. It will be his 
only mount of the day. . . . Robbie Davis and Alex Solis were both back 
Saturday after being involved in a three-horse spill Friday. "I tried to avoid 
them, but it happened so quick, I couldn't miss them," said Davis, who suffered 
a bruised arm. "I hit (Vaunty's) head with my right arm as I was falling and it

EDISON'S TAYLOR HAPPY TO WIND UP 12TH

Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande completed an undefeated cross-country season by 
winning the 12th annual Kinney national championship Saturday at Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' race, Edison junior Shelley Taylor finished 12th in 18:21.72. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't expecting to do real well," Taylor said. "But I'm happy with how I 
did. Next year, I'll expect to do better." 
</P>
<P>
Quintana, a senior who finished third in last year's final, ran the 5,000-meter 
course in 15 minutes 7.22 seconds. He trailed early but rallied after the first 
mile to pull ahead of Jason Casiano of Portage, Ind., who finished second with 
a time of 15:17.16. 
</P>
<P>
"I made my move when we started going up the hill," Quintana said. "After we 
got over the hill, the field started coming back to me and I found myself on 
top. I then tried to work the downhill to the best of my ability." 
</P>
<P>
David Hartman of Canyon Country Canyon, who placed third in 15:20.96, said the 
fast early pace in the heat caught him by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"They went out so hard I had to catch up," said Hartman, who was in 11th place 
after two miles. "It was a little hot, but I was able to work the hill and make 
my move near the end." 
</P>
<P>
Other local finishers included James Menon of San Luis Obispo, who finished 
ninth in 15:33.07, and Angel Martinez of San Gabriel, who finished 16th in 
15:43.44. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, Melody Fairchild of Boulder, Colo., won the 
girls' championship. Fairchild's time of 16:39.26 broke the meet record of 
16:40 set by Connie Jo Robinson of Cincinnati in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Rothman of Westlake Village was a surprise second-place finisher in 
17:38.36. Veronica Barajas of Channel Islands finished fifth in 17:47.50, and 
Deena Drossin of Agoura, who won the West regionals last week, finished sixth 
in 17:53.07. 
</P>
<P>
"This feels great because it's my first win over Deena in my life," said 
Rothman.

FUMBLE RETURN GIVES ARLINGTON CHAMPIONSHIP IN DIVISION IV

Theron Conner of Riverside Arlington picked up a fumble and ran 89 yards to 
score the decisive touchdown in the Lions' 10-6 victory over Baldwin Park in 
the Southern Section Division IV championship game at Ramona High Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
In a defensive first half, Arlington took a 3-0 lead on a 34-yard field goal by 
Ryan Bradford with 4:02 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin Park dominated early in the second half. The Braves drove inside 
Arlington's 20-yard line before Fernando Arredondo's fumble was recovered by 
Conner, who ran untouched down the Baldwin Park sideline for the score to give 
the Lions a 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that he fumbled and it was just laying there," Conner said. "The ref 
even said that he was wondering when I was going to pick it up." 
</P>
<P>
Conner's play turned out to be crucial in the fourth quarter after Baldwin 
Park's Jerry Sims returned an interception to the Arlington seven-yard line, 
setting up a five-yard touchdown run by Arredondo to cut the Lions' lead to 
10-6. 
</P>
<P>
Following an Arlington punt, Baldwin Park threatened late in the fourth quarter 
with an 11-play, 56-yard drive that began on its own nine. But Arlington 
stopped the Braves on downs to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We really held together as one unit at the end," Conner said. "We knew that 
the game was on the line." 
</P>
<P>
Arlington, which finishes with an 11-3 record, earned its second Southern 
Section title. The Lions defeated Riverside Rubidoux, 23-8, in 1981. Baldwin 
Park finished the season with a 10-3-1 record. LONNIE WHITE

HUT-TO-HUT SKIING IN THE ROCKIES

<P>
Would we make it before dark? My heart pounded as I scanned the dim woods 
ahead. Snow whispered as my skis slid forward. Being lost in Colorado's Sawatch 
wilderness on a frigid January night was a grim prospect. 
</P>
<P>
The snowdrifts and twists of deep forest were all beginning to look the same. 
Somewhere ahead lay the Polar Star Inn, a warm mountain cabin with wood stoves 
and cozy bunks. 
</P>
<P>
Security. If you could find it. 
</P>
<P>
Brian, group leader of our six-person team, churned through fresh powder ahead. 
We were skiing the 10th Mountain Hut &amp; Trail System. Patterned after the 
European "Haute Route" in the Swiss and French Alps, the 21 huts are linked by 
300 miles of trails in the wilderness between Leadville, Vail and Aspen. Each 
hut is about six miles from the next, at altitudes between 10,300 and 11,700 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
However, we were beginning to realize that skiing seven miles of snow-obscured 
trail was not the same as a summer walk in the woods. It was, in fact, hard 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The sun sank toward a distant western ridge, radiating shafts of red and gold 
through the dying storm. Crystals winked blue, red and yellow as they drifted 
down past our rosy faces. Shadows lengthened. Had we read the map correctly, or 
were we on the wrong mountain? 
</P>
<P>
Ahead, the West Lake Creek Trail crested the slope, emerging from the shadowy, 
frosted pines into a scintillating, smooth white glade. Our packs, laden with 
winter clothing, food and sleeping bags, creaked with each gliding step. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, up ahead came the distant shout, "Polar Star Inn!" Grins of relief 
swept through our tired group. Astonishment quickly followed. This was a cabin? 
Golden logs swept upward in a two-story mountain home, complete with decks and 
picture windows. 
</P>
<P>
As we crunched through the entry, a delicious wave of warmth left from the 
previous night's fires swept over our frozen faces. Behind us, the last snowy 
breaths of the storm whispered across the decks, and the sun showered the 
indigo sky with liquid crimson. 
</P>
<P>
There are as many concepts of heaven as there are people. My idea is peeling 
off cold, stiff socks by the hot glow of a pine fire. Our friend Jay burst 
through the door carrying a stack of wood from the woodpile. Stuffing kindling 
into the cast-iron stove, he soon had a blaze popping and roaring. 
</P>
<P>
We circled around in red-cheeked worship. "There are ice crystals all over the 
toilet seat," he said with a grin. "Or, at least there were." Jay was the 
rugged type. 
</P>
<P>
Since visitors are required to do a few chores at each hut, I dug several pails 
of snow out of a nearby drift and set them on the stove to melt. The huts, we 
discovered, were built with an ecologically sensitive approach. 
</P>
<P>
No dogs are allowed because melted snow is used for drinking water. Wood piles 
are stocked by volunteers during summer months, so winter skiers don't have to 
scrounge for firewood. Skier impact on the surrounding forests is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Brian took aim at dinner and lit the propane cooking Communal dinners are 
heartwarming occasions. As companions and strangers saute veggies and swap 
tales of the day's thrills, friendships form quickly. And more than one 
wilderness love affair has blossomed by a crackling wood stove. 
</P>
<P>
The well-insulated cabin soon reached a toasty 75 degrees. Polar Star Inn has 
bunk space for about 16 in the upstairs loft, and space is guaranteed when 
reservations are made. We traded back massages on one of the coveted, 
downstairs bunks by the wood stove. Mattresses are provided, but you must bring 
your own sleeping bag. 
</P>
<P>
Exploring, we found the ultimate in decadence and wilderness luxury: a 
wood-fired sauna. We set a blaze in its small stove as the next storm broke 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
"It's 200 degrees in here!" yelled a muffled voice over the crackling roar of 
the wood stove. The sauna door slammed wide and sweaty bodies flashed out into 
the howling, sub-zero blizzard. "It's three below zero outside!" yelled one 
woman. "Welcome to the 200-degree club!" I lost my footing and post-holed into 
chest deep snow. Brrr. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Fritz Benedict, an architect who was one of the designers of Vail and 
Aspen, and then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara brought Benedict's dream 
of the American Haute Tour to fruition with the creation of Margy's Hut (named 
after McNamara's wife Margaret) and McNamara Hut. 
</P>
<P>
They named the trail association after the U.S. Army's famous 10th Mountain 
Division, whose skiers and climbers trained at nearby Camp Hale. Those rugged 
men became veterans of fierce World War II battles in the Italian Dolomites in 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
Like other ski hut networks in the United States, this one links trails with 
overnight lodgings. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 skiers schussed the twisting trails to the remote huts last 
winter. But since skiers must make reservations, and since each hut is limited 
to about 16 people per night, the cabins rarely seem crowded. Popular weekends 
such as President's Day fill early, while midweek tours are often available on 
short notice year-round. 
</P>
<P>
We awoke the next morning to a crystalline blue sky and the long shadows of a 
golden sunrise. The aroma of coffee and cinnamon pancakes pulled the sleepy 
skiers from their bunks. Strangers but a day before, we traded good-morning 
hugs as we gazed out over the frozen splendor. 
</P>
<P>
Today would bring more challenges: a long descent past Fulford Cave, then a 
rigorous climb up the notoriously steep Iron Edge Trail. Somewhere past the 
whispering aspens, high in a grove of fir trees in the Sawatch Range, lay Estin 
Hut, our next refuge. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Kennedy would certainly have understood our exaltation that dawn. As he 
said: "We do these things not because they are easy, but because they are 
hard."

POP FACES: A PRECOCIOUS BRAT GETS SOPHISTICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scottish singer-songwriter Roddy Frame, the foundation of the group Aztec 
Camera, sounded every bit the wizened veteran as he chatted recently in a 
Universal City hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
"As you get older you realize life's too short to be sitting around," he said, 
dragging on a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
That staring-in-the-face-of-mortality musing is a tad disconcerting coming from 
a 26-year-old -- especially a baby-faced one who looks more like 16. 
</P>
<P>
When this was pointed out to him, Frame shrugged and grinned. "I was always a 
precocious little brat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Frame's songwriting first drew attention in Glasgow a full 10 years 
ago, and he was just 19 when the first Aztec Camera album, "High Land, Hard 
Rain," was released to tremendous critical and alternative-radio praise. 
</P>
<P>
Though he never broke out of the underground in the United States, Frame became 
an instant star in Britain. That album also won him such fans as Elvis 
Costello, who picked the group as the opening act on his 1983 tour, and Mark 
Knopfler, who signed on to produce the second Camera album, "Knife." 
</P>
<P>
Now, following the failed soul experiment of 1988's "Love," Aztec Camera, which 
will be at the Wiltern Theatre on Friday, has returned with "Stray." The album 
again establishes Frame as a precocious popster with its emphasis on 
sophisticated, worldly stylings. 
</P>
<P>
But it also captures a youthful energy with the likes of "Good Morning 
Britain," a strong, upbeat duet with B.A.D. leader and former Clash-man Mick 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
The album, Frame said, is largely the end product of spending a year at home 
outside London with his eclectic record collection. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have (jazz guitarist) Wes Montgomery followed by Anita Baker and the 
Clash," he said, describing a typical listening session. "I fell in love with 
the guitar again." 
</P>
<P>
In that year of down-time he also matured as a songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
"On the last album I wanted every word to mean something." he said of "Love." 
"You start out wanting to write like Marvin Gaye, but end up Roland Barthes or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
But Frame made it clear he's not maturing too fast. He sounded every bit the 
wide-eyed boy as he told of his star-gazing the night before when he went to 
the rough-hewn Hollywood club King King to see the L.A. blues band the Blue 
Shadows. 
</P>
<P>
"Norm from 'Cheers' was there," he said, his eyes gleaming. "But he was 
standing. It would have been great if he was sitting at the bar with a beer 
like on the show." STEVE HOCHMAN

NOTEBOOK: GOING FOR MOOD MUSIC AT ST. MARK'S IN VENICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. Mark's, the jazz club-cum-California/French restaurant that opened in 
Venice earlier this year is going through changes. First, Francois Petit, who 
helped start St. Mark's and ran the restaurant portion of the operation, has 
left. His one-time colleague Mike Quinn, who had originally confined his 
activities to the music end of the place, has taken over both the restaurant 
and the club as operating partner. He hopes to reclaim the interest of the 
dining public. Gil Saulnier, who had been chef at the now-defunct Le St. 
Germain in Hollywood before joining St. Mark's as executive chef, remains in 
charge of the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically," Quinn says, "we found that the music kind of overshadowed the 
restaurant at times. But we have so much good talent in the kitchen that we 
feel we have to represent them strongly. We're trying to give people a style of 
music now that's more compatible with dining and with the style of our food. 
What was happening with some of the bands we booked, especially when we had 
dancing, was that the room changed a little too fast and a little too radically 
from early to late -- so that people who were in here dining would sometimes 
feel that they were sitting in a different place than the one they had come 
into. Now we're starting the music earlier, around 6:30 or 7 p.m. Wednesdays 
through Saturdays, but it's more low-key, with usually a piano player who 
sings, and a bassist and guitarist. Our idea is to have a big-name entertainer 
come in once every two or three months to kind of highlight the place." The 
menu, he adds, has changed slightly since St. Mark's opened. Pizzas, for 
instance, are now available as appetizers. "It's in response to the seasons," 
Quinn says, "and to what people seemed to like and want." 
</P>
<P>
FENNEL GOES BISTRO: According to restaurateur Mauro Vincenti, his Fennel in 
Santa Monica -- whose kitchen is the province of Jean-Pierre Bosc and 
alternating French-based chefs Michel Rostang, Andre Genin, Michel Chabran and 
Yann Jacquot -- is in the process of being transformed into a more casual, less 
expensive restaurant. "The chefs want to make it into a bistro," he says. "The 
main reason is that Michel Rostang, besides his own restaurant, has three very 
successful bistros now in Paris, and he would like to do something like that 
here." (Genin also has a bistro in addition to his main Paris restaurant, Chez 
Pauline.) 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant will be remodeled to look more bistro-like, Vincenti adds, and 
there will be plenty of new ideas on the menu. He expects the changes to be 
complete by early next year. But, he adds, "We're dealing with permits and 
things now, and you know how that can go."

FURNITURE MAKER CARVES NICHE IN ART WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
THE RICH AND FAMOUS LINE UP TO OWN THE DETAILED WORK OF TOPANGA CANYON'S TOMAS 
BRAVERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, Reilly is a regular contributor to Valley Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From his brook-side, tree-shaded, Mediterranean house and workshop in rustic 
Topanga Canyon, master furniture craftsman Tomas Braverman creates unique 
pieces of functional art for television stars Larry Hagman and Harry Hamlin, 
KABC news anchor Paul Moyer, actor Robert Wagner, "Cheers" producer Charles 
Burrows and numbers of affluent cognoscenti. 
</P>
<P>
One prolific collector is philanthropist and art collector Max Palevsky, who 
characterizes Braverman's work as evocative, rather than innovative, in the 
manner of a Charles Eames or other great designers. "Tom specializes in 
creating pieces that are reminiscent of an era. He is a master craftsman, a 
dying breed," Palevsky said. "He is an authentic artisan." 
</P>
<P>
Moyer agrees. "Having a Braverman in your home is like having a Ferrari in your 
driveway," he said. Although Moyer's father died when he was 7, he said he 
remembers him as being artistically gifted with his hands. "I didn't inherit 
any of that, but I do appreciate it," Moyer said. 
</P>
<P>
If Braverman's clientele seems limited to the rich and famous, it is because 
each of his pieces is one of a kind that takes months to complete and is, 
therefore, expensive. 
</P>
<P>
"I did an intricately carved wine cellar door in Japanese white oak for the 
president of Bechtel Corporation," Braverman said, tilting back in a chair in 
the almost all-wood office sanctuary at one end of his vast workshop. 
</P>
<P>
"The door took four months to execute -- from the beginning of the commission 
to delivery and installation of the completed work. It was full of 
swashbuckling swirls and decorative pieces. Very Renaissance Spanish. Ornate," 
Braverman said. 
</P>
<P>
The door cost $18,000, which the client could well afford for a unique piece of 
handcrafted art that will last the life of the house, Braverman said. But it is 
not something that just anyone could consider commissioning. 
</P>
<P>
The exclusivity of Braverman's commissioners is both a source of pride and 
sorrow to the man who is chiseling his way into woodworking history. 
</P>
<P>
"When you feel you have an artistic gift, you want to share it, to have it 
seen. The work of fine artists is in museums for people to see. The work of 
musicians is on tapes and discs for people to hear. Some people who are 
creating fine furniture in the country today are working under commission to 
create things for their city or state. I would like to create furniture or 
doors or gates for public buildings for the people of Los Angeles or California 
since the work that I do echoes our California heritage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Braverman can create a fine dining room table in the manner popular in 
18th-Century England or a 19th-Century French armoire, he is partial to 
Hispanic styles. "I learned my skills in Spain. I love the Spanish and Mexican 
idiom. It is so culturally rich and vibrant. It suits my feeling for my work," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is work that, in spite of its creator's fear of obscurity, has been seen by 
the masses much more frequently as of late. 
</P>
<P>
In the 20 or so years that Braverman, 50, has been carving out a name for 
himself in his scenic curve in the canyon, the trendy art publications and 
stylized living magazines have begun beating a path to his door. First it was 
smaller, esoteric and limited-circulation publications, but in the past few 
years his doors, gates and furniture have been shown in the ultra-glossies such 
as Architectural Digest and Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Braverman, who is soft-spoken and studiously courtly in his 
speaking-to-the-press persona, admits he is temperamental about his work. 
</P>
<P>
He was displeased when one art and design magazine refused to credit a table of 
his that it pictured in a spread on the Robert Day house in Los Angeles. 
Braverman said, in disgust, that he was told it was because he didn't advertise 
in the publication. 
</P>
<P>
He is equally unhappy with people he considers artistic Philistines. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some people who come to my workshop who do not understand what I do. 
What I do is not make formula doors or tables or gates with doodads," Braverman 
said. "What they get when they come to me is an original piece of art, created 
on commission for them personally. They are buying my life and my talent and a 
lot of my time. If they don't understand about that -- that I want to create 
something of lasting beauty for them -- there is no reason to talk." 
</P>
<P>
Palevsky said Braverman's attitude is not bravado or bad temper. "This is a 
very serious person. He has studied his craft and is a serious artisan. There 
is a touch of melancholy about Tomas, although he does get more cheerful with a 
drink," Palevsky said, remembering trips to the studio. 
</P>
<P>
Braverman has made more than 100 pieces of work for Palevsky, including two 
giant, hand-carved gates for his Malibu home. "The gates are magnificent and 
are aging beautifully," Palevsky said. "I also have doors and tables and beds 
that Tomas has made." 
</P>
<P>
Braverman values Palevsky as a patron of his work and as a person. "He has an 
appreciation for what I do that is satisfying," the craftsman said. 
</P>
<P>
Moyer also appreciates what Braverman does. 
</P>
<P>
"You see this table?" the artist asked, moving his hands along the gleaming 
expanse of a huge refectory table of gleaming walnut on traditional English 
pedestals that he uses as a desk. The table is 13 feet long by 42 inches wide 
and is, amazingly, all of one piece. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul Moyer asked me how much it would cost to build him a table like mine, and 
I told him between $10,500 and $15,000 depending on how much time would be 
involved in the styling. Later, out of curiosity, he asked me how much it would 
cost to build a similar table that was not all of a piece. I told him he would 
save $5,000, and then I began to explain why the table made of one piece was so 
much more valuable. He just smiled and stopped me. He knew," Braverman said. 
"You see, he knew." 
</P>
<P>
He pauses for a moment, staring out a window. 
</P>
<P>
"Some pieces of wood are magnificent. They are heroic," he said, continuing. 
"When you begin to make something of them you must realize that you are working 
with material that took nature 200 or more years to create. If you are going to 
cut down a tree like this in order to make something out of it, what you make 
had better be of a value and beauty, and the person who receives the object 
should understand the gift." 
</P>
<P>
Braverman is a man of simple tastes and grounded values. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to work with my hands to create beauty. I like working with my wife, 
who does all the finish work on my pieces. I like the fact that my assistant, 
Ed Koda, has turned into a master furniture builder and woodworker himself 
during the years he has worked with me. I like living close to the land," 
Braverman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for the majority of people today who lead such alienated, 
compartmentalized lives. They put themselves in ecologically disastrous cars 
and drive to work in isolation. They spend their days on the phone talking to 
disembodied someones. They are alienated from the very processes that allow 
them to live, like farming or building their own shelter, so they have no real 
respect for the Earth. They buy things, like furniture, that has been 
mass-produced and that has no lasting value. The things they buy are 
disposable. Their lives become disposable. They are rootless and adrift," 
Braverman said. 
</P>
<P>
Abruptly, leaning forward in his chair and totally focused, Braverman's voice 
took on the sound of a fist striking the table. "The poorest peasants in Spain 
used to have a richer life than we do because they lived closer to the land and 
their clothing and furniture was handmade with love." 
</P>
<P>
The philosophy may be ingenuous, but it is not lacking in passion. 
</P>
<P>
Tomas Braverman began life as Thomas, or Tom, in Los Angeles. He attended 
Black-Fox Military Academy, Pomona College and UCLA, before beginning a quest 
for artistic enlightenment that took him to Japan, where he studied pottery, 
and Spain, where he apprenticed with a master furniture craftsman. He adopted 
the Spanish version of his name, Tomas, in honor of his teacher, Antonio 
Rodriguez Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Braverman had never been formally introduced to either country's 
language did not hold him up for long, although he said his Spanish became much 
more fluent than his Japanese. His Spanish fluency helped him court his wife, 
Kiyo Kamitono, after they met at UCLA in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese was her native tongue, but her English was not well developed. But 
Kiyo was also fluent in Spanish because she had worked for the Brazilian 
airline Varig. So the young American man and Japanese woman -- with nothing 
really in common but a foreign language and their mutual attraction -- began 
living together shortly after meeting. 
</P>
<P>
This cohabitation shocked her relatives, she said. "They were so relieved when 
we quickly married," she added. The couple now are the parents of daughter Mia, 
6, and son Antonio, 5 months. 
</P>
<P>
Although Braverman has evolved into a thoughtful and respected craftsman, he is 
not above telling stories on himself. A favorite is about his first meeting 
with Larry Hagman's wife, Maj. 
</P>
<P>
"She came to the workshop and we had a long discussion, many years ago. We 
talked about the work and designs and different periods of furniture. She knows 
design. She knows periods and styles. It was a good beginning, and they have 
ordered at least 15 pieces from me," Braverman said, warming to his story. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, when we were touring my workshop that first time, she looked at me 
critically and said in her Swedish accent, 'You look very strong. I am very 
strong too,' and with that she grabbed me around the middle and lifted me up." 
</P>
<P>
As she had advised, Maj Hagman was strong. 
</P>
<P>
"She broke my sternum," Braverman said, laughing in delight. "I had to go get 
taped up." 
</P>
<P>
Broken bones aside, Braverman knows he leads a good life, one that's right for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I have clients who are important and famous," the craftsman said, "and some of 
them have said they envy me. They see me living and working in the canyon, 
making things with my hands. They think it is romantic, but it is not such an 
easy life. 
</P>
<P>
"Some clients are not so nice, although most are. I spend a lot of time and 
mental energy creating pieces. The pay is not great for the hours put in. There 
are times I wish I did not have to work so hard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But, I know that I have made the right choice with my life," Braverman said, 
looking out at the sun-dappled canyon. "Sometimes I wish things could be a 
little different. But not the work. Nothing else would have been right for me 
to do."

HATE CRIMES DECLINE, BUT MINORITIES ARE UNEASY; 
</P>
<P>
RACISM: BLACK AND JEWISH LEADERS BELIEVE THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE GREATER THAN MANY 
POLICE SUSPECT, WITH SOME INCIDENTS GOING UNREPORTED. 
</P>

<P>
When Ventura County NAACP President John Hatcher emerged from his residence 
last week and discovered his garage door painted with racial slurs, he was sure 
the vandalism was no mere child's prank. 
</P>
<P>
"The hate is growing, particularly in Ventura County," said Hatcher, who says 
he has been targeted by racial bigots for years. "They say, 'You should go back 
to Africa. We want a pure white race.' " 
</P>
<P>
The attack on Hatcher's Oxnard residence was one of a dozen incidents of 
violence or vandalism directed at racial and religious minority groups that 
have been reported to Ventura County authorities this year. 
</P>
<P>
While law enforcement officials describe the level of such hate crimes in the 
county as relatively minor, some black and Jewish leaders who have been the 
target of such attacks say they believe the problem might be greater than many 
authorities suspect. 
</P>
<P>
In Hatcher's view, there is an under-reporting of hate crimes in the county. 
</P>
<P>
He said some crimes go unreported because victims do not know the identity of 
their assailants and believe police will never find the culprits. He admits he 
has not reported all the hate mail and calls he receives. 
</P>
<P>
People "feel it's a waste of time," Hatcher said. "Why should you report 
something that police can't do anything about anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
Among the dozen hate crimes reported this year, one of the most serious 
involved a black member of the Ventura College basketball team who was 
assaulted by a known skinhead in January. The attacker was arrested and jailed. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident in July, the Temple Beth Torah in Ventura was defaced with 
the letters "ZOG," in reference to Zionist Official Government, an anti-Semitic 
term used by white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents early in the year appeared to reinforce an analysis last year by 
Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, who expressed concern about "a 
growing pattern" of hate crimes in the county. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, however, law enforcement officials say white-supremacist 
activities have actually been on the decline in the county, partly because of 
arrests of hate-crime perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
Racist literature has all but disappeared from mailboxes, car windshields and 
local high school campuses where they were once regularly dispersed, police 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as crimes go, they're on the downswing," Detective Jeff Killion of the 
Ventura Police Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Police now take credit for the decline in hate crimes, saying the arrest of key 
leaders, aggressive patrols against vandalism and increased vigilance of groups 
responsible for hate crimes has driven the perpetrators away. 
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Defamation League, which has made a point of documenting neo-Nazi 
activity around the country, in a report released early this year also said 
there has been a decline in hate crimes in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura and Simi Valley have the most cases linked to hate groups. 
</P>
<P>
A group in Simi Valley uses the name "SVH Skins" in its graffiti, police said. 
Vandals in November spray-painted cars at an apartment building with "KKK." 
</P>
<P>
But since the arrest by Simi Valley police of three teen-agers in November, 
1989, for spray-painting racist graffiti at Simi Valley High School, "there's 
been a significant decrease in the visibility of skinheads and their graffiti," 
Lt. Bob Klamser said. 
</P>
<P>
Two Ventura groups linked to hate crimes call themselves the Midtown Skins and 
the Skinhead Dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Killion said the Skinhead Dogs' activities declined in Ventura when two of its 
leaders were jailed. A leader of the Skinhead Dogs, Scott Porcho, 22, was 
imprisoned on felony battery charges for attacking another man at a beach 
party, but returned to Ventura two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Wozney, 21, was arrested in January and pleaded guilty to attacking a 
black member of a Ventura College basketball team with a bottle. He was 
released from a work-furlough program Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
A third group, the Ventura Boot Boys has ceased to exist, but the group was a 
spinoff of a Santa Barbara group and was never very active in Ventura County, 
Killion said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, police are reluctant to call the war on hate crimes over. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, less than a dozen skinheads are still living in the area, Killion 
said. Skinheads are talking about forming an organization that would unite 
individual groups around the county, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you get two or more of them together, and they get on a binge of 
deviant behavior, anything can happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Klamser declined to say how many Simi Valley youths are still active in 
skinhead organizations, but he characterized them as juveniles who have no 
known links to larger white supremacist organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Simon, who prosecuted Porcho, said youths who start 
with minor hate crimes, such as vandalism and assault, are dangerous because 
when they drift away "some skinheads have left the county and got involved with 
the KKK." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline in incidents, organizations targeted in hate crimes are 
keeping vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
When the door of the Jewish Federation Council in Thousand Oaks was scratched 
with two swastikas in early October, Jewish leaders suspected it was the same 
vandals who attacked the residence of an elderly black couple in Agoura a month 
earlier, slashing furniture, smashing plants and spray-painting swastikas on 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more behind it than just a few scratches on the door," Rabbi Alan 
Greenbaum of Temple Adat Elohim in Thousand Oaks said. "Simply because you are 
Jewish, there are people who will hate you." 
</P>
<P>
Greenbaum said all three of the oldest Jewish synagogues in Ventura County have 
had swastikas and other anti-Semitic slurs painted on their buildings during 
the past 10 years. Like the vandals who scratched swastikas at the Jewish 
Federation Council building, those responsible were never found. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Simi Valley and Ventura police departments have detectives 
specifically assigned to investigate hate crimes, but there is no countywide 
agency that tracks offenses committed by skinheads and neo-Nazis. Crime reports 
fail to categorize offenses against a racial or ethnic minority, or a gay 
person. 
</P>
<P>
In other counties that do track hate crimes, such incidents are rising 
dramatically. The Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission, for example, 
has documented a 32% increase in the first six months of 1990, compared with 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Mornell, executive director of the commission, attributed some of the 
increase to the better reporting methods by police. Fifteen of the 46 law 
enforcement agencies in Los Angeles now track hate crimes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mornell also blamed increased ethnic tensions on population shifts that have 
caused racial and ethnic minorities to move into what were once predominantly 
white communities. He said he believes Ventura County might be subject to the 
same increase in hate crimes affecting most cities in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The recent spate of hate crimes, particularly in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, 
"does reflect something about the climate of those communities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Ellenbogen, a member of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith committee 
that keeps tabs on skinhead groups in Ventura County, talks grimly when he 
recalls seeing a newspaper photo of local youths with their arms raised in a 
Nazi salute. 
</P>
<P>
More horrifying than the images they evoked was that they once lived around the 
corner from his Camarillo residence. While they have moved, Ellenbogen said he 
is convinced skinheads are still carrying out anti-Semitic acts in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, he was sent copies of a national neo-Nazi publication found in an 
Ojai restaurant. Inside were anti-Semitic references and a cartoon of a 
thick-lipped, curly haired Israeli dubbed "Uncle Sol." 
</P>
<P>
"I had relatives who died in the Holocaust," Ellenbogen, 73, said. "I've come 
to understand that they (people who commit hate crimes) are here among us. . . 
. Their beliefs and their philosophy are not dead."

RESERVISTS, THEIR FAMILIES REACT AS DUTY CALLS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: AN ORIENTATION SESSION SEEKS TO PREPARE THOSE WHO WILL REMAIN BEHIND. 
THE SEPARATION IS PARTICULARLY HARD DURING THE HOLIDAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Lt. Col. Doug Stone of the U. S. Marine Corps Reserve was curious. He wanted to 
know how the large anti-war demonstration across town in front of the Federal 
Building in Van Nuys was going. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it going well? Is it peaceful?" he asked visitors in his office Saturday as 
he slipped out of his uniform and put on a blue button-down shirt. "I mean, 
it's great they're doing it. We're protecting the right for them to do it." 
</P>
<P>
However, protecting that right had a new meaning for Stone and the families of 
other Marine reservists who gathered Saturday at the Marine Reserve Training 
Center in Encino. Ordered to report for duty that could take them to the 
Persian Gulf for a threatened war, they and their families were preparing for 
painful separations from loved ones at holiday time. 
</P>
<P>
The Stones and the other families attended an orientation day for more than 250 
Marine combat reservists from around California who are being activated in 
support of Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
During the morning and early afternoon, the spouses were briefed about medical 
benefits and financial arrangements, given military ID cards, and told how to 
use the commissary and military hospital. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day that several families said they had prayed would never come. And 
although recent developments concerning the release of hostages in Kuwait was 
cause for some optimism, the fear and apprehension would not go away. 
</P>
<P>
Attending the session with Stone was Kathy, his wife of 18 1/2 years, and his 
two teen-age daughters, Julie and Christy. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I would ever be in this position," Kathy Stone said. "It's 
been a sharp learning curve. It's hard to imagine a Christmas without Dad. 
First I felt this disbelief. Then I felt this detachment." 
</P>
<P>
However, she said she is braced for the separation: "Sure, I feel a wide range 
of emotions. This is overwhelming. But I also feel pride and confidence in our 
men. I know they'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband added: "This is a hardship that, in many ways, I wish they did not 
have to go through. But we will get through it. And we will grow." 
</P>
<P>
Gunnery Sgt. Stephen Hernandez addressed the families, giving them a barrage of 
practical information. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to cover a whole lot of things," he said. "Many of them were scared. 
But I think giving them all the information eased their minds. They felt that 
things were going to be all right." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the abrupt call to duty, many families held hurriedly arranged 
holiday celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
During a break in their processing, Cpl. Robert Robbins and his wife, Maria, 
recalled the Christmas they held a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Our families got together, and we all gave Robert his presents," Maria Robbins 
said softly as she rested an arm on her husband's shoulder. "And he gave us our 
gifts. It was nice. 
</P>
<P>
"I obviously don't want him to go. But for whatever reason, he has to. And I 
will stand behind him." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, who has been a reservist for 3 1/2 years, said he had been anxious for 
months about being called to duty and was somewhat relieved when the call 
finally came. It ended the tension and uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to be over there a long time," he said. "That Saddam 
Hussein is crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Other families facing the separation said they were trying to maintain their 
holiday routine. Rick Espitia, a reservist since 1979, and his wife, Maureen, 
said his two young sons would not celebrate Christmas until Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to keep Christmas as normal as possible," Maureen Espitia said. 
"The boys know Dad won't be around. But I told them we would all go to 
Disneyland when he got back."

CROWDED JUVENILE HALL MEANS LIVING AT THE EDGE OF VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nighttime reading is not allowed for youths forced to sleep in makeshift 
dormitories at the San Fernando Valley Juvenile Hall because guards fear that 
something as innocuous as a book or magazine could conceal a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
With the hall's population now 45% over capacity, even the most minor fight has 
the potential for escalating out of control. As a result, there are rules for 
everything, most of them aimed at keeping the minors who are incarcerated for 
offenses ranging from drug possession to murder under the tight discipline of 
watchful guards. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the only possession those who bed down in the day rooms that serve 
as dormitories are allowed at night is their underwear. At night, and at times 
during the day, they are not allowed to utter a word. And, because only five at 
a time can be in the bathrooms, where silence is also enforced, it can take 
more than an hour for all the youths to complete their pre-breakfast routines. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not able to provide the kind of secure but relaxed atmosphere that 
would probably be beneficial to the children," said Trula Worthy-Clayton, the 
Sylmar facility's superintendent. "Even teen-agers want a little peace and 
quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, under an order from the California Youth Authority to alleviate 
crowding, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted to apply for $18 
million in state bond funds to expand the Sylmar hall by 160 beds by 1993, and 
to plan for the future replacement and expansion of the aging Central Juvenile 
Hall in Lincoln Heights. 
</P>
<P>
The one-story Sylmar hall, encircled by a red brick wall, was built in 1978. It 
has enough private rooms for 393 youths, but hundreds of others must sleep in 
open day rooms, which are also used for eating, relaxing and watching 
television. 
</P>
<P>
For troubled youths, living so close together means that violence is but a 
blink away, detention officers said. During a visit this past week, a reporter 
and photographer saw an altercation -- quickly squelched -- flare up when one 
boy bumped into another, and they also saw a table that had been broken in two 
in a schoolroom fight. 
</P>
<P>
"This constant face-to-face contact is not ideal, especially in view of the 
gang situation on the outside and the fact that many times these kids despise 
each other," said Donald McGruder, probation director at the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Officers keep watch for any signs of gang identification, such as complicated 
knots in inmates' shoelaces, and they frequently frisk their charges for 
pencils, rocks or pieces of metal that could be used as weapons. Infractions of 
any of the rules can lead, in the most extreme cases, to confinement in an 
isolation room or even to longer sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile halls are way stations for youths awaiting court hearings, placement 
in one of the county's 15 juvenile detention camps or, for those in the most 
trouble, a bed in one of the California Youth Authority's more prison-like 
facilities. Most of the hall residents range in age from 10 to 17 years, but 
some are even younger. Only about one in 10 are girls. 
</P>
<P>
Yet similar crowding at county and state facilities has caused a backlog in the 
system, increasing the average stay at Sylmar from 21 days in 1986 to about 28 
today, administrators said. Several youths interviewed this week reported that 
they had been in limbo in Sylmar for up to seven months. 
</P>
<P>
The youths say their large numbers create basic problems: They aren't allowed 
to take afternoon naps because their beds are locked away, and telephone 
conversations are cut short. 
</P>
<P>
"When there's more people, we get less privileges, that's all," said Manuel, 
16, who had arrived at the hall the night before on the latest of several stays 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a few said they actually prefer being with others in the dormitory 
to the isolation of the private rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem like you're in a jail if you sleep in the day room," said 
Cornelius, 16. "If you sleep in one of them rooms all alone, it's jail." 
</P>
<P>
The 6 a.m. wake-up call in one of the hall's units touched off frenetic 
activity. The 19 youths sleeping in their own rooms were marched -- five at a 
time, hands behind their backs, eyes straight ahead -- into the bathroom. 
Meanwhile, the 12 who slept on the day room floor stripped their beds, folded 
their mattresses and stored them in closets -- all while wearing only their 
underpants. 
</P>
<P>
Their clothes are taken away at night to prevent their use in escape or suicide 
attempts or, in the case of shoes, as weapons. But those assigned to bedrooms 
keep their clothes outside their doors and are allowed to dress in privacy. 
</P>
<P>
There are not enough county-issued bathrobes to go around, said Charles Drake, 
a senior detention officer. In fact, on this morning, Vance, 17, is one of only 
three inmates in the day room wearing a robe. He said it was because he had 
been there four months, longer than most of the others. 
</P>
<P>
The 31 boys who assembled in the quickly transformed day room to wolf down a 
hearty breakfast of pancakes, ham, oatmeal and grapefruit were silent as they 
ate, under orders from the officers. 
</P>
<P>
"The closer they are, the more of them there are, the louder they talk," said 
Rosen Bauer, a detention officer. "Pretty soon, you've got a whole bunch of 
kids talking and you don't know what they're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
The youths march to school daily at a campus run by the Los Angeles County 
Office of Education on the hall property. There, crowding has had an impact as 
well. Several times a week, there are more students than can be taught in 
classrooms and the excess are sent to exercise in the gym. Several times a 
year, when the hall population nears or tops 600, small groups of students are 
sent back to their units without receiving any instruction, Principal Solomon 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The facility has grown steadily since being rebuilt after it was destroyed in 
the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. Similar growth has occurred at the 117 county and 
state youth facilities around California, especially those in or near larger 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
About 17,600 youths were incarcerated statewide last year, compared with about 
14,000 in 1984, an increase of 26%, according to youth authority statistics. 
The youth authority inspects the county programs and runs state facilities for 
the most hardened young criminals. 
</P>
<P>
But state youth authority officials have allowed violations of their own rules 
against letting youths sleep on mattresses on the floor in recognition of the 
lack of sufficient space for all those sent to juvenile hall. State officials 
have also permitted the facilities to exceed the standard of six youths per 
toilet, shower and sink. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not ideal, not something we would want to see on a permanent basis," 
said Rito Rosa, regional administrator for the youth authority. 
</P>
<P>
In May, all three county juvenile halls, including Los Padrinos in Downey, were 
cited by the state for failing to meet even the more lenient emergency 
standards and were given two months to correct violations ranging from fire 
hazards and too-thin mattresses to insufficient indoor living space, according 
to state inspection reports. 
</P>
<P>
Los Padrinos was the last to meet the requirements, a week after the June 
deadline had passed and after the state had ordered it closed, Rosa said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors and staff members at the Sylmar facility are skeptical that the 
plan for two new 80-bed buildings will ensure a bed for every youth. 
</P>
<P>
"Come back two to three years after they build these new buildings and there 
will be people on the floor there too," said Tommy Brooks, a detention services 
officer working the day shift in one of the hall's wings. "With the gap between 
the rich and the poor widening and the recession coming, there'll always be 
more kids." 
</P>
<P>
According to juvenile justice experts, the increasing numbers of incarcerated 
youths can be blamed on several factors: gang and drug activity among younger 
children, more public pressure to lock up those who commit violent crimes, and 
burgeoning numbers of young adolescents whom one state official called the 
"echo boomers" -- the grandchildren of the post-war baby boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be cyclical -- we knew we'd have a lot of kids in the early spring 
every year -- but now we have that year-around," said Rich Rose, an assistant 
deputy director at the youth authority. 
</P>
<P>
A county plan developed in 1982 to satisfy state rules counted on the opening 
of the Challenger Youth Memorial camp in Lancaster to relieve this crowding. 
But even though 440 beds were opened at Challenger in April, things are not 
much improved. 
</P>
<P>
Trailer-like dormitories are scheduled to open at all three halls by early next 
year, providing 60 additional beds at Sylmar. Efforts to cut the number of 
youths entering the halls continue, McGruder said, with 14 youths from the 
Sylmar hall released on electronic surveillance "leashes," 14 in a house arrest 
program, 35 under a freer home supervision program, and a few in foster or 
group homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything helps," said Craig Levy, a spokesman for the county probation 
department. "But it definitely hasn't solved our problem."

20,000 TURN OUT FOR PARADE OF LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Forty boats glittered and twinkled in Channel Islands Harbor for the annual 
Parade of Lights as people crowded on the shore, some wearing neon light rods 
on their heads like glowing crowns. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 watched the 25th anniversary of the boat parade Saturday 
night, while others partied at harbor hotels, condominiums and dock sites. 
Picnickers at Peninsula Park, the starting point of the parade, sat around warm 
barbecues and tables laden with food while children played on swings. 
</P>
<P>
Helene Keddington said she came to the park at 6:30 a.m. to save a table for 
the evening festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"I just left my stuff here and came back in the afternoon. Most people are 
pretty honest here," she said. While waiting for the parade, her family played 
football and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Keddington's friend Diane Whiting, who works at the marina, said she had fun 
watching preparations for the parade. "These people get all psyched up about 
this, particularly as the final day comes closer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Judges viewed the boats from a community room at Peninsula Park. One of the 
judges, actor Ron Masak, who plays the sheriff in the television series 
"Murder, She Wrote," said he has been renting a slip at the harbor for about 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, they asked me if I wanted to be the grand marshal, but Santa Claus 
beat me out," Masak said. 
</P>
<P>
The lead boat, owned by Tom and Susan O'Brien, carried Santa Claus, played by 
Bob Carter, coordinator of the event. The boat was decorated with Christmas 
trees at bow and stern, and Christmas music was piped over a loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
Boats not only sported twinkling lights, but live bands and carolers. One boat 
saluted U. S. troops in Saudi Arabia with a large globe atop the pilothouse; 
carolers dressed in white sang at the bow of the ship. 
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights for children in the crowd was the fly-by of a helicopter 
with Santa and his sleigh outlined in lights. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor John K. Flynn, whose district covers the marina, served as a judge 
for the eighth year. 
</P>
<P>
"The caliber of decorations is probably the best I have ever seen. And the mood 
of the people is tremendous. I'm impressed with the number of kids here this 
year," Flynn said. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

PASSENGER, 17, KILLED IN SYLMAR CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old Sylmar youth was killed Saturday when a car he was riding in hit 
the center divider of Truman Avenue at San Fernando Road in Sylmar, then 
careened into a wall, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Ignacio Diaz was riding in the back seat of the car when the crash 
occurred at 12:30 a.m., Sgt. John Amott said. 
</P>
<P>
Another passenger, who was not identified, suffered moderate injuries, but was 
released after being treated at Holy Cross Medical Center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the vehicle, who reportedly had a bloodied face, and another 
passenger apparently fled the scene after the crash, Amott said.

HOOSIERS CONFINE USD TO THE RED, WIN TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BLOOMINGTON, Ind. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Their eyes tried to avoid the stands, where it seemed as if they were engulfed 
by a sea of red. They tried not to pay attention to the other bench, where Bob 
Knight stood in all his glory, screaming at the referees. And they refused to 
be seen gawking at those championship banners hanging from the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
So maybe the University of San Diego isn't exactly your national power, but the 
Toreros were undefeated with five victories. They are favored to win their 
conference. Certainly, it was no time to be intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came out," said Dondi Bell, USD center, "we wanted them to respect us 
as much we respect Indiana." 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros managed to garner Indiana's respect, and maybe for a while they put 
a scare into them, but these are the Hoosiers, and they proved just why they 
never have lost a game in the 17-year history of the Indiana Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Overcoming an early deficit, Indiana ripped the Toreros, 91-64 for the 
tournament title, delighting the crowd of 16,746 at Assembly Hall who drove off 
in their cars with bumper stickers reading, "And on the eighth day, God created 
the Hoosiers." 
</P>
<P>
"They're definitely the best team we've played this year," said USD forward Pat 
Holbert, in a bit of an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoosiers (7-1) also say they came away with newfound respect. The only 
thing they knew about this team entering the tournament was that its coach, 
Hank Egan, was best of friends with Knight. 
</P>
<P>
But friendship or no friendship, Knight made it clear quite early to his 
players that this was no time to get sentimental. In fact, when the Toreros 
took a lead midway through the first half and still owned a 27-23 lead with 
6:59 left, Knight had become downright testy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to be up like that," said Holbert, who equaled his career high 
with 27 points and made the all-tournament team. "But we knew Indiana wasn't 
going to fold up, not with 16,000 fans screaming for the Big Red." 
</P>
<P>
This also happened to be a time when a kid by the name of Calbert Cheaney, a 
6-foot-6 sophomore forward, introduced himself to the Toreros. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, they will remember the name. 
</P>
<P>
There he was, one minute, hitting a 12-foot jumper from the right side. Then 
came a 26-foot shot from the wing, and a dunk coming in from the left baseline. 
And he followed it with another 18-foot jumper, a layup from the right side and 
a layup from the left side. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, Cheaney had 17 points, making seven of 10 shots. He finished the 
game with 25 points, and was selected Most Valuable Player of the 
all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
Just how good is this sophomore? 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best player I've ever played against in my life," said Holbert. "He 
is one hell of a player." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, that includes a couple of All-Americans by the name of Bo Kimble and Hank 
Gathers of last year's Loyola-Marymount team. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a handful to deal with, let me tell you," USD Coach Hank Egan said. 
"He's a gifted player at both ends of the floor. He has so much versatility, he 
had us chasing him all night. 
</P>
<P>
"When he's done, he'll be as good as anyone who's played here." 
</P>
<P>
And, as if Cheaney needed any assistance, the Toreros complied, with 6-foot-9 
Bell spending all but 13 minutes of the game on the bench. When Bell went to 
the bench with eight minutes left in the half, the Toreros still owned a 22-21 
lead, which turned into a 44-31 halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever opportunity USD had of recovering, vanished as quickly as it took 
Bell to pick up his fourth foul 59 seconds into the second half. He returned 
three minutes later, and in another three minutes, he was back on the bench for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very tough to sit there and take," Bell said. "I love playing in 
situations like this, when you're the underdog, and no one's rooting for you. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd love to have a place like this ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
For now, it can only remain a dream.

TEMECULA VALLEY CLIPS PALOS VERDES; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: SEA KINGS STOPPED IN CIF SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION VIII CHAMPIONSHIP 
GAME, 29-7 
</P>

<P>
Ronnie Long had three touchdown runs and intercepted three passes as Temecula 
Valley High claimed its first CIF championship Saturday night with a 29-7 
victory over visiting Palos Verdes in the Southern Section Division VIII title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The loss marked the last football game for Palos Verdes, which is closing next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Temecula Valley (11-3) took the lead for good at 10-7 on Long's two-yard run 
with 4:25 left in the first half. Long led the Bears with 83 yards in 16 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
After Mike Lassig's fumble recovery near midfield, Temecula Valley took a 16-7 
lead on David Gonzalez' 26-yard pass to Greg Campbell with 46 seconds remaining 
in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (8-6), which had a four-game winning streak snapped, took its only 
lead at 7-3 as running back George Felactu scored from a yard out, culminating 
the first drive of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sea King quarterback Tim King dropped back to pass only six times in the first 
half, but was guilty of three turnovers. King threw two first-half 
interceptions and was hit in the pocket before losing the ball to Lassig. 
</P>
<P>
On the game's opening series, the Bears drove to the Palos Verdes 29-yard line 
before missing a field goal. Then, on the first drive for Palos Verdes, the Sea 
Kings gained 41 yards in four carries before King was intercepted by Long. 
</P>
<P>
That turnover helped produce the game's first score on the ensuing drive, a 
36-yard field goal by Temecula Valley's James McKee. 
</P>
<P>
Long closed the scoring with two short touchdown runs in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Felactu paced Palos Verdes' attack with 65 yards in 12 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez picked apart the Palos Verdes defense with short passes in the first 
half, completing 11 of 14 attempts for 101 yards and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
For the game, Gonzalez completed 17 of 24 passes for 201 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez' favorite receiver was Campbell, who had 10 catches for 84 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings committed six turnovers; the Bears had only one. 
</P>
<P>
A 70-yard punt by John Miller was one of Palos Verdes' highlights.

DOMINGUEZ HILLS FALLS TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the buzzer sounded ending regulation play Saturday night at Southern 
California College, the Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball team thought 
it had won its third game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But referee Dave Maddux, who was near midcourt, made a delayed call that 
allowed a desperation layup by Vanguard Jeff Bickmore to count although it 
appeared the clock had run out. The shot tied the score of non-conference game, 
60-60, and the Vanguards went on to defeat Dominguez Hills, 67-64, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third overtime loss for Dominguez Hills (2-4) this season. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy surrounding the final seconds of regulation play was only a 
small portion of a wild and sometimes out-of-control game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty obvious that that shot was after the buzzer," Toro Coach Dave 
Yanai said. "But we had plenty of opportunities to nail down a victory for 
ourselves and we didn't knock them down." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai was talking about free throws. The Toros missed six foul shots in the 
final minutes of regulation and the overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
"When you put yourself in that kind of situation by not taking care of 
opportunities earlier in the game, you set yourself up for a call like that to 
make a difference," Yanai said. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills trailed by as many as nine points, but rallied to tie the 
score, 54-54, on a basket by guard Robert Barksdale with 6:07 to go in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
In the final 1:50, center Michael Moore and guard John Brown missed a pair of 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills took the lead with four seconds left on a rebound basket by 
center Albert Kiilehua. 
</P>
<P>
On the inbounds pass, the Vanguards' Jason Quinn brought the ball along the 
right side of the court, and once across the midcourt, flung a desperation shot 
that hit the bottom of the rim. 
</P>
<P>
But under the basket stood Bickmore, who scored on a reverse lay-in as 
Dominguez Hills players celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
It was a physical final five minutes. Barksdale missed one of two free throws 
and so did Vincent Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Bickmore gave SCC the lead for good, 64-63, when he made one of two free throws 
with 1:07 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's three-point shot from the left corner bounced off the rim as the buzzer 
sounded.

SOUTH GATE'S BILLINGSLEA TAKES LONG WAY HOME; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: AFTER ATTENDING FRESNO STATE, HARBOR COLLEGE AND NORTHERN ARIZONA, 
HE ENDS UP AT CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took nearly fours and a like number of colleges, but senior Keith 
Billingslea, the much-traveled shooting star from South Gate High, may have 
found a home in his own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Billingslea, the 1986 Times Southeast prep basketball player of the year, 
becomes eligible to play at Cal State Dominguez Hills on Friday. The Toros 
opened the season with three consecutive losses, and although the team has 
shown signs of shaking out of its doldrums, the addition of Billingslea will 
provide Coach Dave Yanai with the option of starting three Division I 
transfers. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll see a lot of playing time," Yanai said. "I don't want to rush him, but 
if we're going to get him ready for the conference season (in January) he will 
be seeing a lot of playing time quickly." 
</P>
<P>
How he came to play at Dominguez Hills, a Division II school, is a saga that 
even the athlete wishes he could rewrite. During his wayward journey through 
collegiate basketball, he started at two Division I colleges and starred for a 
season at a local community college. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm worse off because the reputation (of being a quitter) follows you 
wherever you go," he said. "People are always going to say, 'When will he leave 
next?' But if people get to know me they will see a different type of person." 
</P>
<P>
At South Gate Billingslea, a 6-foot-1 off-guard, averaged 30.1 points a game. 
He was so heavily recruited that, at times, he wouldn't answer the telephone in 
his house. 
</P>
<P>
"I was tired of being recruited," he said. "I thought that if I signed early I 
would be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
Wake Forest was his first choice, but for some reason that even Billingslea 
can't explain, he signed during the early signing period of his senior year 
with Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
"With Fresno State, I wish I could change things, but I can't. . . . I felt it 
was the best program at the time," he said. "If I had waited, passed up on the 
early signing period, I think I would have had more options." 
</P>
<P>
Billingslea started a handful of games for the Bulldogs and was voted to the 
1987 Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. all-freshman team. But he felt uncomfortable 
playing point guard, where he had been shifted. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of his sophomore year, he was told he was being shifted to small 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was counted out as a sophomore," he said. "They had signed four more 
guards. In practice I was behind three forwards, two of them were 6 feet 6." 
</P>
<P>
In mid-December, after completing his third semester of classes, a 
disillusioned Billingslea left Fresno State, determined to return to college, 
but not sure of his playing future. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time I was so confused I didn't want to rush anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He enrolled at Harbor College in the fall of 1988. His goal was to earn another 
chance at a Division I scholarship, but to be eligible under new NCAA 
guidelines, he had to first earn an associates of arts degree. 
</P>
<P>
On the basketball court he helped Harbor advance to the state playoffs, 
averaging 18.8 points a game. But despite being voted first team All-Southern 
California Athletic Conference honors and gaining the required academic degree, 
few four-year schools came knocking. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to several of them early in the year, but then (it got out that I was 
a quitter)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Arizona Coach Pat Rafferty stayed in touch with Billingslea and, with 
a lack of offers on the table, Billingslea signed a letter of intent to play 
the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
But once in Arizona, he quickly discovered that the campus at Flagstaff wasn't 
to his liking. Among other things, he realized that "I'm not a cold weather 
person." An honors student in high school, he also felt that Rafferty had 
misled him about educational opportunities at the university. 
</P>
<P>
"At Northern Arizona, when I got there, all the courses I wanted were full," 
Billingslea said. "I had to add on classes. . . . We studied (in a noisy 
building). I asked the coach to get the team another place to study and (he 
didn't seem to care)." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Billingslea started 12 of his first 13 games and led the team in scoring 
(13.5 points) and rebounding (4.7). 
</P>
<P>
Amid a player uprising in January, Rafferty was fired. Three players, including 
Billingslea, quit the team. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, I didn't want to play basketball any more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But former Santa Monica Crossroads High Coach Dave Benezra, who was a part-time 
assistant at Northern Arizona, recommended that Billingslea contact Dominguez 
Hills. Billingslea called Yanai and enrolled in classes in late January. 
Because of NCAA regulations, he does not become eligible until he completes two 
semesters at the school. He'll miss the Toros' first seven games. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets to me sometimes, just watching," he said of the start of the season 
which saw the Toros drop games to Grand Canyon, Biola and Northwestern Iowa. "I 
see things -- passes -- that I know I can do, that don't get done, but in the 
back of my mind I know my time will come." 
</P>
<P>
According to Yanai, Billingslea is expected to provide leadership as well as 
add a proven player to the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a very solid guy who adds a great deal of maturity to the team," Yanai 
said. "He has a settling affect on the other players." 
</P>
<P>
Playing out his career only minutes from his South Los Angeles home, 
Billingslea acknowledged that it has been difficult to justify to others why he 
took the route he did. 
</P>
<P>
"If you talk to any coach, they will tell you that I am very likable and very 
coachable," he said. "Those were just situations that weren't very comfortable 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
But he appears to be comfortable at Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very positive experience so far," he said. "I love the people 
here. I love the school and its educational opportunities. The coaching staff 
is very good and Yanai is the best teacher around." 
</P>
<P>
Billingslea said he has learned from his past experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"I can inform other people (about making decisions about college)," he said. 
"If I was to write out a list of things I would tell them, it would be a long 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the long trip that eventually brought him back home has ended at 
Dominguez Hills, a place that he said he had been looking for all along.

OCHOA, MOORPARK END SUSPENSE EARLY IN STATE WRESTLING FINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After waiting 22 years for his first state team championship, Moorpark College 
wrestling Coach John Keever was happy the suspense lasted only two matches into 
the last session of the state finals Saturday night at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
The title, so long in coming, was suddenly in Keever's hands -- as was Delfino 
Ochoa, who leaped into Keever's arms after winning the championship at 126 
pounds. Ochoa's victory mathematically eliminated Moorpark's pursuers in the 
team race. 
</P>
<P>
"It took the heat off us," said Keever, who was voted state coach of the year. 
"I knew when he won that thing that we were state champs." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, which finished second last season, finished with 96.25 points to nip 
Lassen (88) and Fresno City (77.5). 
</P>
<P>
In winning its first championship in 24 years of wrestling, Moorpark took 
control in the two Saturday sessions with two firsts, two seconds, a third and 
a fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"We made plans for this. We had no surprises," said Keever, who told his team 
at its first meeting in August that he believed the Raiders could win the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa was voted outstanding wrestler of the tournament in a landslide. Teammate 
Robby Cook finished second in the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa led off Moorpark's Fab Four Finalists with a 5-3 victory over defending 
champion Orlando Montero of Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 3-1, Ochoa tied it with a takedown 12 seconds before the end of the 
second period. Ochoa (32-4-1) began the third period in the down position, but 
Montero let him escape for the winning point. 
</P>
<P>
"I was still kind of scared of him because he's so big," Ochoa said through 
teeth bloodied from biting his tongue during the match. "I kept going at him, 
and I didn't let him set up any moves." 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa, who won at 118 last season, became the third wrestler in Moorpark 
history to win two state championships. 
</P>
<P>
A runner-up last year at 134, Cook (36-6) moved up a weight, to 142 pounds, and 
up a place with an easy 10-1 bashing of Cuesta's Brian Fortunbaugh in the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark freshman Phil Guerrero (28-8-2) never could get the upper hand in his 
177-pound match against Bakersfield's Luis Castro, who led throughout in a 4-1 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Tony Flores, second at 177 last year, added another second-place 
medal to his collection. Flores (27-7) tied Ken Stegall, 4-4, midway through 
their 190-pound match but faltered thereafter in a 9-5 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark made its move in the afternoon session, turning a 1 1/2-point deficit 
to Fresno into a 10.25-point first-place cushion and putting four wrestlers 
into the finals.

CARSON DEFENSE TRIGGERED AVALANCHE OF POINTS IN WIN OVER HIGHLANDERS

Despite what the scoreboard said, Carson High's formidable offense was not the 
reason for Granada Hills' demise in the teams' City Section 4-A Division 
semifinal Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
That was the opinion of Granada Hills strong safety Derrick Stewart when asked 
about the Highlanders' 57-13 loss to the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, an All-City selection last season, was part of a secondary that was 
riddled for 330 yards and four touchdowns by Carson quarterback John Walsh. 
But, says Stewart, who also starts at tailback for Granada Hills, the Carson 
defense was more responsible for the stampede than the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"They really blitzed us in the second half," Stewart said. "It didn't surprise 
us, but we just couldn't protect Bryan (Martin)." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, the Highlanders' All-West Valley League quarterback, had passed for 
1,718 yards and 19 touchdowns -- with only five interceptions -- entering the 
game. But he threw four interceptions against Carson (11-1), completing 10 of 
25 passes for 194 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
He was sacked three times and forced to hurry his passes on several other 
occasions. Two second-half interceptions were returned for Carson touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
With Granada Hills (10-2) trailing, 20-7, midway through the third quarter, 
defensive back Tarriel Hopper intercepted a Martin pass and raced 35 yards for 
a score. After a Carson field goal, linebacker Marcus Long returned an 
interception 40 yards for a touchdown and a 36-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt like we could play with them," Stewart said. "We were playing tough 
and stubborn, but those two interceptions really hurt. They put us down. . . . 
After that it was just a long game in the second half. Just a loooong game." 
</P>
<P>
Lurking in the shadows: Poly's high-powered rushing attack has received most of 
the attention during the Parrots' improbable march to this Friday's City 3-A 
title game against Lincoln, but the defense has made several crucial plays 
during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday night's 35-28 semifinal win over previously unbeaten Fairfax (11-1), 
Poly was clinging to a 15-14 lead late in the second quarter when senior safety 
Raul Torres intercepted a fourth-down pass and returned it 93 yards for a 
touchdown -- and a 22-14 lead -- as time expired in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks earlier, in the first round of the playoffs, Poly (10-3) trailed 
Locke, 20-15, midway through the fourth quarter when the Parrots recovered a 
fumble on their own 32-yard line. Poly then marched 68 yards for a touchdown 
and a 21-20 lead with a minute to play before sealing the 29-20 victory on 
Danny Martinez's 40-yard return of an interception for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"The offense gets all the credit, but we don't care," said Torres, who played 
only baseball for Poly as a junior. "As long as we keep winning, that's all 
that matters." 
</P>
<P>
Add Poly: After compiling a 10-36-1 record from 1985-89, the Parrots' recent 
success has gone over big with the Poly student body, yet doubters remained 
before the win over Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people kept coming up to us and saying, 'You guys had a great season. 
Too bad it's going to end against Fairfax,' " Torres said. "They were all 
acting like we were going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Record evening: First-year Crespi basketball Coach Chris Nikchevich could not 
have asked for a more spectacular home opener than Friday night's 120-87 win 
over Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
The Celts (3-1) set a school record for most points in a game, and John Curtin 
set school records for points in a game (43) and three-point field goals (11). 
</P>
<P>
"It felt good to come back home," said Nikchevich, a three-year starter at 
Crespi from 1979-82. "We had a good-size crowd and we finally shot decently." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi, which had shot between 33% and 35% from the field in its first three 
games, hit 43% of its shots against Calabasas.

RACE VICTORIES ARE FULFILLMENT OF VOWS FOR FAIRCHILD, QUINTANA 
</P>

<P>
After Melody Fairchild of Boulder, Colo., and Louie Quintana of Nipomo won 
their respective races at the Kinney Cross-Country National Championships 
Saturday at Morley Field, both runners quickly looked back to the same December 
day two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For Fairchild, what she most remembered of the 1988 Kinney Nationals was how 
San Diego County's Kira Jorgensen, the winner of the previous year's race and a 
favorite to repeat, let the pressure get to her. Jorgensen not only failed to 
repeat, she finished out of the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
On that day, Fairchild vowed never to let anyone else's expectations become 
more important than her own. 
</P>
<P>
Quintana's recollections of that Saturday are quite different. All he recalls 
is a wicked fever that caused him to finish last in his first appearance at the 
meet. Quintana -- who a week before had bettered his personal best by more than 
20 seconds -- was devastated. But he vowed to vindicate himself. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, both Fairchild and Quintana made good on those vows. 
</P>
<P>
"Kira Jorgensen was under so much outside pressure," Fairchild remembered 
Saturday. "I went up to her after the (1988) race and told her she was an 
inspiration to me because she didn't let (her finish) bum her out." 
</P>
<P>
Fairchild knew that if she was going to stay away from the pressures that got 
to Jorgensen, she was going to have to shield herself from the outside. So for 
three weeks leading up to Saturday's race, Fairchild denied all interview 
requests from the media. 
</P>
<P>
"We just focused on her running her own race," said her coach, Guy Zakrevsky. 
"We weren't concerned with other people." 
</P>
<P>
It seemed to work. Fairchild's time of 16 minutes 39.26 seconds over the 
5,000-meter course was not only 58 seconds ahead of second-place finisher 
Jeannie Rothman of Westlake Village, but it also set meet and course records. 
</P>
<P>
The previous course record was held by Janet Smith of Edison, N.J., who ran a 
16:43.7 in 1983. The prior meet record was held by Connie Jo Robinson of 
Cincinnati, who ran a 16:40 in Orlando in 1981, the only year the race was not 
at Morley Field. 
</P>
<P>
Fairchild also accomplished what Jorgensen could not. Fairchild's first-place 
finish was her second in a row at the Kinney meet, the first time anyone has 
done that since Erin Keogh in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of glory you can get from working hard," Fairchild said. "I 
wanted to give every ounce of energy I had in me, and that's what I love about 
running." 
</P>
<P>
Quintana's first-place finish of 15:07.22 was three seconds faster than his 
third-place finish at the 1989 Kinney meet. But it wasn't his 1989 performance 
that came into focus after Saturday's victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 1988 finish. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a really bad day," Quintana said. "I went from finishing fifth in the 
Western Region a week before and running a PR by 20 seconds to finishing 32nd. 
But I got sick during the week before the finals. I had a temperature of 102, 
and I just didn't run a good race. 
</P>
<P>
"Finishing 32nd was depressing, but I was determined to come back and win the 
trophy." 
</P>
<P>
Quintana led from early on, taking the lead from Madison's Phil Downs just 
after the lead pack of 10 had ascended the Upas Street hill. 
</P>
<P>
"I was planning on making my move a little later on the downhill," Quintana 
said. "But the pack started coming back to me (on the loop before the 
downhill), so I went out then." 
</P>
<P>
Quintana maintained a wide lead until the second time over the hill loop. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I started giving it some thought, 'I'm going to be a national 
champion, I'm going to be a national champion,' " Quintana said. 
</P>
<P>
At that point Jason Casiano, who finished second at 15:17.16, kicked and 
narrowed a 15-second gap to eight seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"He was really putting on a surge," Quintana said. "And when he did, the 
downhill was in perfect position -- I just opened it up on the downhill." 
</P>
<P>
Some 800 meters later, Quintana was about to cross the finish line. He looked 
over his right shoulder to see if Casiano had gained ground. He hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still waiting for someone to give me a really good race," Quintana said. 
</P>
<P>
Kinney Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook's Milena Glusac, a sophomore running in her first Kinney meet, placed 
seventh at 17:59.82 and seemed happy just to be in the race. "Once you get 
here, it's half the job," she said. "I just wanted to run the best race I could 
and hopefully finish in the top 10." Glusac was the second sophomore to finish. 
Amanda White of Dulaney, Md., placed third at 17:40.69. . . . The only freshman 
in the race, Carrie Garritson of Lake Arrowhead, finished 11th at 18:18.41. . . 
. Phil Downs, the early leader in the boys' race, ended up 14th at 15:38.02.

BONITA VISTA MUSCLES UP, USES ITS INSIDE GAME TO BEAT CHULA VISTA FOR TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bonita Vista High School flexed its muscle with a strong inside game to beat 
No. 7 Chula Vista, 77-61, in the championship game of the Hilltop Invitational 
boys basketball tournament at Hilltop High on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Barons (4-1) kept their game plan simple -- feed the ball as much as 
possible to 6-foot-5 senior center Rope Perry. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole game plan was to work it inside out," Bonita Vista Coach Jim Conlin 
said. "We wanted to go to Rope and when we did that, we played within 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Perry, who was selected to the all-tournament team, dominated the boards on 
both ends of the court and finished with 21 points. His performance helped fend 
off a second-half surge by the Spartans (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
Bonita Vista's David Rusk had nine second-half points and finished the game 
with 13. Mike Barnett, named the tournament most valuable player, scored 10. 
Barnett and Rusk both hit three-point baskets in the second-half. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Chula was a good team going in there and I knew we were going to have 
to play one of our top games to beat them," Conlin said. "It was a great win 
for us. I couldn't be more pleased with my players and their composure 
throughout the game." 
</P>
<P>
Bonita Vista ran up an 18-6 lead early before Chula Vista's Ken McDuffy sank a 
three-point basket and Andy Duran converted a pair of free throws and a jumper 
to pull within 20-11. 
</P>
<P>
The Barons then tightened the defense a notch, allowing Chula Vista only six 
points on free throws for the first six minutes of the second quarter. With 
2:28 remaining, Shane Howell hit his first three-pointer as the Spartans went 
on a 6-2 run to narrow Bonita Vista's lead at halftime, 32-26. Howell, a 6-5 
senior, scored 21 points on the night, making three three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
A fired-up Jerome Green, who was held to four first-half points, led a Chula 
Vista comeback in the third and gave the Spartans a temporary one-point lead, 
but steals by Barnett and a layup by Perry gave Bonita the lead for good. 
Green, a 6-2 sophomore, ended with 14 points and was also named to the 
all-tournament team. TERRY RATHER

DIVISION II CHICO USES EX-GULL TO BEAT USIU 
</P>

<P>
Two years ago, guard Jake Hodges transfered out of U.S. International to play 
basketball elsewhere. He departed, figuring Gulls Coach Gary Zarecky would 
never give him enough playing time. 
</P>
<P>
So where did Hodges, a 6-foot-3 senior from Philadelphia, decide to walk on? 
Zarecky's alma mater, Cal State Chico. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Hodges got enough playing time to help lead the Division II Wildcats 
to a 114-104 upset of Zarecky's Gulls in front of 172 at Golden Hall. The 
victory for Chico (4-2) was its first against a Division I team this season. 
</P>
<P>
And as Hodges was pouring in 21 points in 34 minutes, USIU was dropping to 1-6 
and 0-2 at home. Hodges couldn't have been more satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"I left here because I didn't think I would get enough playing time," Hodges 
said. "So I worked hard all summer just to come down here and win a game." 
</P>
<P>
After the Gulls jumped to a 5-0 lead, Hodges scored the Wildcats' first two 
points of the game on a pair of free throws. He finished 11 for 13 from the 
free-throw line. But down the stretch he twisted the knife in USIU's back with 
two slam dunks, the second of which came after the Gulls' O.J. Bonner led 
Hodges perfectly with an overthrown in-bounds pass. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges sprinted under the errant pass, dribbled once, then went up for a 
thundering one-hand jam that gave Chico a game-clinching 109-100 lead with 48 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
This was a humiliating loss for Zarecky, as the Gulls led the first 7:36 of the 
game before the two teams battled to a 47-47 tie at halftime. Chico, which shot 
72% from the field in the second half, went on a 7-0 run to lead 54-49 early in 
the second half. USIU came back and pulled ahead, 72-69, on a layup by Mike 
Sterner at 10:19. But 11 seconds later, Pat Condon hit a three-pointer to tie 
it and the Gulls faded after that. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got no cliches for this," an angered Zarecky said. "We beat ourselves. 
It's a devastating defeat for this ballclub. I've never been here before. I'm 
in pain. 
</P>
<P>
"I still believe this team's going to win. But we've got to re-assess our 
individual talent. When you get to this point, with the team playing as bad as 
it is, you have to take a look at the personnel or the system." 
</P>
<P>
USIU shot 47% from the field and 75 of its points came from two players: senior 
guard Kevin Bradshaw, who finished with a game-high 40, and forward Isaac 
Brown, who had 35. Brown, a 6-4 sophomore from New York, had the best night of 
his career, hitting 15 of 22 shots from the floor and finishing with 15 
rebounds in 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw, who entered the game averaging 31.2 points a game, had a cold 
shooting night. But he was often triple-teamed when he had the ball, as he 
finished 16 for 33 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
No other USIU player finished in double figures and the Gulls got only 10 
points out of the six players who came off the bench. USIU also had 28 
turnovers.

AZTECS BARELY HEALTHY ENOUGH TO PUT HURT ON CAL POLY POMONA 
</P>

<P>
Final examinations are given this week at San Diego State, and this is what 
basketball Coach Jim Brandenburg should do about it: Assign trainer Mark Haines 
to pick up whatever books the Aztecs might need throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
That way, nobody can strain an arm muscle lifting some thick English book. And 
if Haines would turn the pages, too, nobody would sustain a paper cut. The way 
things are going for the Aztecs early, a paper cut would lead to an infection, 
which would linger, and probably cause someone to miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU whipped Cal Poly Pomona, 94-78, Saturday night in front of 827 in Peterson 
Gym, running rampant in the second half after an inauspicious first. It was 
another step forward for the Aztecs, a night of continued development and 
learning the meaning of grace under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
It was also another night of pain. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes before game time, freshman guard Chris McKinney, who had started 
all four previous games, was flat on his back behind the Aztec bench, being 
worked on by Haines. He had come down with back spasms during SDSU's afternoon 
shoot-around. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Ray Barefield -- who missed practice Friday because he was sick -- 
started in his place, and McKinney joined the club on the SDSU bench: A few 
seats away from him was guard Arthur Massey, with bone chips in his left ankle 
and a sprained right ankle. Seated close to Massey was forward Keith Balzer, 
still weak with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
At least both Massey and Balzer dressed. Thursday against Midwestern State, 
neither did. 
</P>
<P>
Like McKinney, both Massey and Balzer are starters. But there was nothing to do 
Saturday except go with three new faces -- Barefield and junior James Lewis in 
the backcourt and junior Nelson Stewart at forward -- and hope for the best 
against Pomona (3-2), a Division II school. 
</P>
<P>
By the second half, McKinney's back had loosened up, and so did the Aztecs 
(2-3). After trailing at halftime, 45-44, they scored the first seven points of 
the second half -- and 14 of the first 22 -- and never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really proud of our guys, the way they came back in the second half," 
Brandenburg said. "They figured out what it took to be successful, and they did 
it." 
</P>
<P>
They did it with a little halftime help from Brandenburg. What did he tell 
them? 
</P>
<P>
"It was worse than First Live Crew, or whatever," Brandenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to rappers 2 Live Crew, but you don't always have time to keep 
up with current musical trends when you feel like you're running an infirmary. 
</P>
<P>
What happened after halftime was SDSU tightened its defense and got much better 
movement on offense. 
</P>
<P>
Center Marty Dow scored an SDSU career-high 29 points, surpassing the 24 he had 
Thursday. Pomona had only three players taller than 6-foot-6, and the Aztecs 
were able to get the ball inside to the Dow, 7-1, time after time. 
</P>
<P>
Barefield had 15 points, eight rebounds, four steals and five assists. McKinney 
finished with 14 points, all in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona led at halftime thanks largely to the play of Terry Ross, a 6-foot-6 
senior forward, who made seven of his first 10 shots and had 14 points at the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Walk-on Jason Powell had to change his number from to 32 from 22. It seems No. 
22 has been retired by SDSU. It was worn by Milton "Milky" Phelps, the Aztecs' 
first All-American. Phelps was NAIA honorable mention All-America in 1938-39 
and first-team NAIA All-America in 1939-40 and 1940-41.

In an era when many businesses are in crisis, people need to protect themselves 
careerwise -- whether you're an aerospace engineer in a threatened company, a 
career woman who has hit the corporate glass ceiling or a student trying to 
decide among a bewildering smorgasbord of college majors what field to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
The Warner Center-based Success Training Institute specializes in helping 
people like these make career choices and changes. The institute was founded in 
1979 by Mary Anne Rust, who said she abandoned a master of fine arts degree 
program in sculpture to become a clinical psychologist because she preferred 
working with live people. She has spent the last decade developing a 
computerized system that matches a client's strengths, interests and 
personalities with careers designed to grow with the changing times. 
</P>
<P>
Two factors distinguish Rust's program, testing and a service that analyzes the 
ever-changing job market. 
</P>
<P>
Testing covers five interest and personality areas and includes Rust's 
custom-designed "Leisure Time" test. The results of these tests are integrated 
into her copyrighted Blueprint for Career Success, which highlights a client's 
talents and self-defeating patterns and ways to overcome them. The client's 
overall quality of life is considered in the Creative Leisure Section, which 
balances work choices against a person's physical, cultural, social and 
spiritual needs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The second service is the career-related Data Bases, which is updated every six 
months to add new technologies and delete glutted or low-paying fields. Rust 
analyzes consumer trends, where companies are moving and what companies are 
coming up by studying more than 20 publications and consulting experts in a 
variety of fields. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Sward, director and president of Behaviordyne, a major test publisher, 
said Rust "covers all areas of personality needed to make a tight 
recommendation and really integrates test results. She measures interests, 
personality and aptitude against real schools, courses and companies, and tries 
to weed out jobs that won't be here in five years." 
</P>
<P>
"The market should not be the determinant," said Pamela Paduano, career 
counselor at Career Prep Enterprises in Brea. "If you're the best, you'll 
succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Rust's writer/director husband, John, said some clients even bring in their 
children who are 16 and older for a career blueprint. Rust has two reports that 
can locate, from 428 undergraduate majors and 500 graduate school majors, the 
course of study most closely allied to a student's interests and aptitudes. She 
also shows them how to get college loans. "The best schools are affordable by 
anybody. There are even loans for living expenses," Rust said. 
</P>
<P>
The Blueprint's Creative Leisure Section balances the pressures of school and 
grades with a student's most relaxing electives and extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
Rust said she shares the concerns of a number of experts who believe that the 
economy may be on the brink of a recession. Her company's strength, she said, 
is in developing an integrated, computerized system to change the databases on 
a moment's notice if a whole industry should go down. For example, five years 
ago, in anticipation of a soft real estate market, she said she began moving 
real estate salespeople into such growing fields as telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
Recent Rust clients have included a 60-year-old aerospace engineer who needed 
help in a shrinking industry. Rust suggested that he update his appearance to 
offset any possible age discrimination and advised him to get additional 
training in biomedical engineering, which he could eventually do part time or 
on contract. "She knew which companies weren't good or didn't support my 
aptitudes," the engineer said. 
</P>
<P>
Rust charges $1,100 for a comprehensive Blueprint, testing and counseling 
sessions. The entire process takes three to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Thranow, career counselor at Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy and 
former dean of students at Loyola Marymount University, sampled the tests at 
Rust's request and found that they help clients focus and eliminate guessing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just in awe of how she pinpointed facets of my personality," said Denise 
Rucinski, a 30-year-old journalism major who found her public relations job 
unchallenging. Her Success Blueprint showed that she might be better suited for 
sales work. Rucinski has subsequently found a sales position with a 
telecommunications firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Something was missing, but I wasn't able to recognize what. Dr. Rust's 
experience in clinical psychology was extremely helpful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We look for well-paying jobs with a good future in the client's interest 
range, as well as the future financial situation of our clients," Rust said. 
</P>
<P>
"By revealing talents and capabilities within myself, the testing renewed by 
self-confidence," said Janice Dunn, founder of Adept Consumer Testing and a 
Rust client. 
</P>
<P>
Through Rust's counseling, Dunn discovered that she was in the right business 
with the wrong partner. Now Dunn has a new partner, Mark Tobias, and together 
they run Adept, a market research company with offices in Encino and Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Rust urges working people to track Financial World's and Business Week's 
quarterly reviews the way many people do baseball scores to find out how 
financially solid companies and industries are, and to see if their careers are 
becoming obsolete. Getting additional training is another survival technique, 
she said.

FEAR LED HER OUT OF THE WOODS; 
</P>
<P>
CRAFT THERAPY BECAME THRIVING HOME BUSINESS

Leslie Zurla's life changed in 1987 when her mother suffered a near-fatal 
stroke. After 16 trips back and forth to Pompton Lakes, N.J., where her mother 
was hospitalized, and hours of waiting and watching, Zurla turned to arts and 
crafts as a form of recreational therapy. Today, those same crafts are part of 
a thriving home-based business called Out of the Woods. 
</P>
<P>
"My crafts started in the middle of the night because I couldn't sleep, and I 
was in such fear. I knew that alcohol was no solution for such intense pain," 
said Zurla, who before her mother's stroke produced television commercials, 
such as Bartles &amp; Jaymes and Secure Horizons, for the Ogilvy and Mather 
advertising firm in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Zurla, 46, smiles when she recalls the many times doctors said, "Your mother's 
not out of the woods yet." But finally, about a year later, "that happy moment 
did come when Mom was out of the woods, and it seemed an appropriate name for 
my arts and crafts business," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Using a grapevine wreath as a base to work from, Zurla creates figurines and 
Old English cottages as decorations that tell a story or detail a client's 
interest. For example, Zurla had one friend who was starting a chimney sweep 
business. She fashioned an English cottage from plywood and designed a "sweep" 
using a black clothespin. 
</P>
<P>
"The first pieces I created were reindeers crafted from sticks and pine cones. 
Then came turkeys using the same materials. And then I began cutting out teddy 
bear shapes from plywood," said Zurla, who had previously done some set design 
miniatures for television. 
</P>
<P>
Zurla literally stumbled across most of her early materials -- sticks, nuts and 
leaves -- while walking in the nearby woods in Pompton Lakes as her mother 
fought to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Zurla continues using found and recycled items for her wreaths. But the 
intricate decorations are no longer just a hobby. In 1988, when her 75-year-old 
mother, Betty, came to live with her in North Hollywood, Zurla began selling 
Out of the Woods crafts and animal cutouts to colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I sold to people I knew during holiday, gift-giving periods, and then people 
started giving me pictures of their homes and animals so that I could create a 
wreath especially personalized to order," she said of the growing business that 
supplements her free-lance commercial work. Zurla said individual pieces take 
up to six hours to complete, and she's created about 1,000 items over the past 
two years. But the benefits Zurla reaps from her Out of the Woods crafts go 
deeper than affording her a flexible schedule or great financial profits. 
</P>
<P>
"Leslie's an extremely creative individual. But she was so focused on her 
mother when she arrived to live here that her own social life suffered. Out of 
the Woods really saved her sanity. And it has also been a way to involve her 
mother in doing something creative, to get her to interact since the stroke 
affected her speech," said Barbara Trotter, a Studio City resident who's known 
Zurla five years. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great thrill the first time she was able to paint one of the plywood 
pigs a bright pink!" Zurla said about her mother. 
</P>
<P>
Zurla is reluctant to market her wreaths and figurines in retail shops. "I'm 
strictly direct-order for now, although a few shop owners who have seen my work 
want to carry my Out of the Woods line. Since I still produce films on a 
free-lance basis, there's enough pressure. My crafts give me such joy, I don't 
want to be so overwhelmed with work orders that I start to hate it." 
</P>
<P>
Simple wreaths start at $20. More elaborate pieces, such as a bakery complete 
with miniature bread loaves, are about $150, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Zurla's artistic drive she attributes to her father, John Omelianuk, 
who owned and operated a deli in Pompton Lakes. "He would often say, 'When life 
gives you lemons, you'd better know how to make a pretty fabulous lemonade,' " 
she remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's what I did when Mom got so ill. I see things in a new light. What 
was a period of crisis has turned out to help stimulate my creativity even 
more."

<P>
Good ol' Ed. Steady ol' Ed. Perennially witty, wise and handsome, Edward Ruscha 
is an artist we can count on to deliver sharp lines in a paradoxical context. 
</P>
<P>
For 30 years or so, he has floated big block words and phrases in gorgeous sky 
paintings, like equivocal messages from a cynical underground. "Those Golden 
Spasms," "I Remembered to Forget to Remember," "Industrial Strength Sleep," 
"Japan is America" and so on, with all due disregard for tidy interpretations. 
He is equally famous for turning Los Angeles' banalities into high art. Gas 
stations, parking lots, coffee shops, apartment houses and the Hollywood sign 
have all been immortalized by the West Coast wildcat of Pop art. 
</P>
<P>
A renegade kid from Oklahoma who arrived here in 1956, Ruscha has been equally 
at ease with art folks and the movie crowd, having hung out with stars and 
played in several films, including a bit part in Alan Rudolph's "Choose Me." 
Naturally he became known as the quintessential Los Angeles artist. This wasn't 
always a compliment, but we didn't care. His shows were booked into the best 
galleries on both coasts and he was ours. 
</P>
<P>
He still is, in spirit and domicile, but it's been a long time since Los 
Angeles could claim exclusive rights to Ruscha appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
The latest evidence is "Edward Ruscha," an exhibition of 75 paintings that 
features works from the '80s along with a few key pieces from earlier periods. 
The show opens today at the Museum of Contemporary Art and continues through 
March 24, but MOCA didn't organize it. Neither did another American museum. The 
exhibition is a foreign import, organized by Bernard Blistene at the Georges 
Pompidou Center in Paris and Elbrig de Groot and Karel Schampers at the 
Boymans-van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam. The show appeared at those two 
institutions as well as at the Cultural Center of the Caixa Pension Foundation 
in Barcelona and at London's Serpentine Gallery before winding up in the city 
that has become so much a part of Ruscha's identity. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he thinks too much has been made of the L.A. connection. "It's a bigger 
question than what Los Angeles is all about. I think my art would have been 
very much the same if I had gone to New York City or Minnesota," he said. "I 
was attracted to the concept of Hollywood and the lifestyle here. But I've 
grown to mistrust it because it has changed. I didn't bargain for digital 
access parking in some concrete structure. Real heaven for me was to drive 
somewhere and park right in front. Now the city is going vertical. I have a 
recurrent nightmare of Euro-Asian systems analysts taking over." 
</P>
<P>
His 1985 painting, "Japan is America," alludes to that nightmare. "That's hard 
cynicism," he laughs. "But I have no ill feeling. It's an exaggeration to get 
at the truth of how we feel. It's also an excuse to make a painting." 
</P>
<P>
Ruscha has no plans to move away from Los Angeles -- "I still like it, it's 
just harder to get around" -- though he does flee to the desert quite 
frequently. Changes in the city don't hinder his art, which often comes from 
earlier experiences. "When I paint a picture of a house, that goes back to my 
roots," he said. "I travel a lot, but I don't come away with new inspiration. 
That goes 
</P>
<P>
back to my stupid teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically everything I've done in art, I was in possession of when I was 20 
years old. I use a waste retrieval method of working. I'll go back and use 
something that disgusted me 15 years ago but that I had enough sense to think 
about. Some artists change dramatically. I see my work more like history being 
written." 
</P>
<P>
The history of Ruscha's own career was fairly steady until a few years ago. 
Unlike the all-too-familiar young artists who make it big for one season or 
veterans who struggle for decades before being recognized, Ruscha has joined a 
rare breed: the respectably successful, well known artist who suddenly becomes 
hot stuff. 
</P>
<P>
About five years ago he won an important mural commission -- his first ever -- 
for the Miami-Dade Public Library in Miami, and the project got the attention 
of the art press. A show of his early paintings at Tony Shafrazi's New York 
gallery was the talk of the town in 1988. Around the same time, collectors were 
said to be signing waiting lists for his new work at the going price of 
$100,000 or so. Meanwhile New York auction prices for his older paintings edged 
up from $192,500 for "Lisp" (November, 1988) to $209,000 for "The Future" (May, 
1989) to $297,000 for "Honey, I Twisted Through More Damn Traffic Today" 
(November, 1989). 
</P>
<P>
Ruscha had shown his work in Paris for many years, but all of a sudden offers 
for big museum shows came in from Japan and Europe. His current exhibition and 
heightened fame have inspired a spate of reviews and features, including the 
cover story for Artnews magazine last December. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview in his spacious Venice studio, the 52-year-old artist 
appeared to have taken the blitz of popularity in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had been more involved with the hub of the art world it might have 
affected me more. But I've been in L.A. for a long time and that has helped me. 
I hid out here, so I didn't get spit out with some art movement. That allowed 
me to stay around longer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real fickle situation. There are so many cycles. I've always been 
prepared for the possibility that my work might dry up and no one wanted to see 
it. A long time ago (fellow artists and I) used to say that if we had to drop 
the whole thing, we could do it without taking any demerits for it. But I've 
worked so long -- about 30 years -- if I can't handle it now I wasn't made for 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
As if listening intently to what he just said, he added emphatically, "I was 
made for the job." 
</P>
<P>
As Ruscha tells it, he has been on the road with art for three decades, and it 
has been "a bumpy ride." He can handle success, but account for it? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Was it his compelling black-gray-and-white silhouette paintings of elephants, 
trucks and skylines that burst on the scene in 1986-87 and grabbed attention? 
Soft-edged, sensuous and sometimes word-less, these paintings struck a new, 
romantic chord for some collectors, but Ruscha denies a dramatic departure. 
"The silhouette paintings are different but not so different. There's a lot of 
influence of photography, as there has always been. The beauty of black and 
white is something I've always worked with in graphite, ink, charcoal and 
photography," he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there's something to the oft-stated theory that Ruscha's work assumed 
new importance because it was viewed as a seminal influence on younger artists 
who use words in their art, such as Mitchell Syrop, Jenny Holzer and Barbara 
Kruger? "I don't see that younger artist using words in their work are 
influenced by me. They are more into media than painting or sculpture," he said 
with finality. 
</P>
<P>
As for his popularity in Europe, Ruscha figures that he simply got swept up in 
foreign captivation with all things American. "You see it all across the board. 
If you want to know about American music, go to England. There are James Dean 
fan clubs in Tokyo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
People from other countries "are genuinely interested in what is going on in 
America. That may be one of the factors in choosing my work," he said. "They 
see me as curiously American, as opposed to other artists who have a more 
international look." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign interest in America is not news, but for Ruscha it is a turnaround. "I 
ran into difficulty in Europe a few years ago because of the words in my work. 
People said the audience couldn't speak English and the words couldn't be 
translated because they were loaded with innuendoes peculiar to American 
experience. Now that curtain has lifted," he said. "They are more curious about 
what artists are up to. I guess it's the American sense of freedom that 
fascinates them. Europeans are more bound by convention. There's an explosion 
of artists in Europe, but they seem to be involved with common causes -- 
social, political, but also the visual influence of painting." 
</P>
<P>
Curators for the current exhibition originally wanted to stage a retrospective 
-- "all the old favorites, the gas stations and other things I am known for," 
Ruscha said. Having had a retrospective in 1982-83 -- which was organized by 
the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and was booked into the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art -- he persuaded them to do a show of works from the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
A few early works provide a foundation: a murky 1959 canvas on which he 
lettered "E. Ruscha"; paintings from 1966-67 with words such as "chemical," 
"automatic," "rooster" and "Vaseline" marching across fields of graduated 
color; a 1977 painting of a brick fireplace, called "No End to the Things Made 
Out of Human Talk." From these beginnings, the exhibition launches into an 
array of word works and silhouette paintings. The Los Angeles show offers the 
bonus of 20 works not seen in Europe. They include a new version of Ruscha's 
Standard gas station image, from the collection of Douglas Cramer, and Jane and 
Marc Nathanson's promised gift to MOCA, "Faster Than a Speeding Beanstalk." 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for the show has caused a flurry of activity on the quiet industrial 
street where Ruscha works. An electronic gate moves back and forth to admit 
visitors. Inside his clean, white, warehouse-like studio, he points out a scale 
model of the museum's galleries, which he has used to plan the installation. An 
assistant answers the door and helps with physical labor. The telephone rings 
every few minutes. Not exactly peaceful, but Ruscha indicates that this 
situation is far from normal. 
</P>
<P>
He moved here five years ago after 20 years in a shabby courtyard complex on 
Western Avenue. "I needed a place with four big walls to work on the Miami 
commission, and this was perfect," he said, explaining that the studio formerly 
belonged to his Los Angeles dealer, James Corcoran, who used it for storage and 
special presentations. 
</P>
<P>
When the excitement dies down, Ruscha is a "pretty regular" working stiff. 
"It's more or less a routine. I bring my lunch pail to work," he said. "As long 
as I have an excuse to do something, I have all the time to do it. I've been 
doing it for so many years that I've forgotten why, and that's probably as it 
should be. You have to treat art like a baby -- commit yourself to it, set 
aside time for it. If you don't, you have problems." 
</P>
<P>
He employs assistants a couple of days a week to stretch canvases and perform 
other mundane tasks, "but I work better when I'm completely alone. That's when 
I can really level out," he said. "I'm the kind of artist who needs singular 
control over the work. I'm not disparaging of artists who have other people 
make their work. Sculptors do that and it can turn out very well. But painting 
is such a solitary thing. I've never found anyone to put the strokes on for me. 
Not that I have a religious stance about it -- I've seen it work too many times 
-- but I don't have an assistant-oriented system." 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the sources and meaning of his work are more difficult to 
answer. Taking a stab at it, he offers, "I yield to impulses, to subjective 
suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
The words and images in his art come from various sources -- printed and spoken 
works, ordinary objects, experiences and memories. Ruscha's abiding love of 
words has something to do with an early interest in printing and typography, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
"I developed a kind of typography that I call Boy Scout Utility Modern. It's 
not about the history or range of typography. It's the kind of thing a 
carpenter might apply to making a letter form. I like it for just that reason. 
I'm more interested in words than how they are made, but I like them to look 
homemade. Some people wear shoes that say something; some people wear shoes 
that don't say anything. I use a type face that doesn't say anything. 
Everything just comes together to make the words," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I feel like I'm doing book covers for mysterious stories. Or story 
titles, though that is not my intent," he mused. Paradoxical combinations of 
words and images come from "deep cynicism about where I live and what I do," he 
said, but he has no formula for success. If he did, he probably wouldn't trust 
it. "I've been so galvanized by the art world and I have so many feelings when 
it comes to art that I think it's the automatic thing, the intuitive thing that 
has the power," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are essential elements of his art. "The quest for paradox has 
always gripped me as an artist. There has to be negative conflict. Disturbing 
things have an attraction to them. The idea of subversion is a powerful 
subject. It's not a question of making pretty pictures. That's not what art is 
all about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally captivated by the irreverence of Marcel Duchamp and the Dada 
movement, Ruscha now talks about discovering earlier art history. "I had no 
interest in easel painting until recently," he said, and he satisfies that 
interest by going to museums. But old art doesn't feed his work. 
Twentieth-Century American life is his constant inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"All my images have a connecting link in a continuity. I'm not sure what that 
link is and I don't really care. It's like contemplating a toothpick," he said. 
"Art for me is the act of making it. Reasons behind it are completely 
secondary. The mysterious element will never be uncovered and that's as it 
should be. The day I go to a Freudian analyst (to figure it out) is the day I 
should have my head examined."

"You're 15, crazy about him, thinking outrageous thoughts . . . ," he 
suggested, letting the film roll as Ryder fell onto her love interest (Michael 
Schoeffling) and -- behind his back but in plain view of the camera -- gave the 
actor's jacket a surreptitious lick. 
</P>
<P>
That touch is one of the more inspired in the film, a coming-of-age drama 
opening Friday in which Ryder plays the religious daughter of a promiscuous 
mom, played by Cher. 
</P>
<P>
"Winona's sensors are so good that I use her as litmus paper," says Benjamin. 
"If the words don't come out right, I change the approach. She's incapable of 
faking and is full of little gifts. That moment could only come from a wild, 
lusting, teen brain." 
</P>
<P>
Movie audiences can see more of Ryder's gifts, more facets of that much-vaunted 
19-year-old brain in the modern-day fable "Edward Scissorhands," which opened 
this weekend. This time Ryder is decked out in a blonde wig as Kim, a 
cheerleader whose initial skepticism toward Edward -- the unfinished creation 
of a scientist who left him with scissors for hands -- blossoms into romance. 
The movie reunites the actress with director Tim Burton, for whom she played 
the Edward Gorey-esque Lydia in the 1988 sleeper-hit "Beetlejuice," and pairs 
her for the first time with her real-life fiance, Johnny Depp (of TV's "21 Jump 
Street"), who plays the title role. 
</P>
<P>
Ryder, small-boned and finely chiseled, arrives for lunch sporting a tailored 
vanilla pants suit and tennis shoes. Short dark hair classically cut, a touch 
of red lipstick highlighting her Cashmere Bouquet complexion, the actress looks 
less like a Hollywood star-in-the-making than a student arriving for a college 
interview. There's a radiance about her that reminds Tim Bur 
</P>
<P>
ton of the "timeless old movie stars," an innocence and fragility at odds with 
the force she's reported to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Winona has an honesty, an integrity which I respect," says Burton. "No matter 
what, she follows her own drummer. She's also canny about things. She knows a 
lot more than she lets on." Patrick Palmer, the line producer of "Mermaids," 
agrees: "The adult side of her is very clear, with very strong opinions. Like 
Cher, she's very calculating in that she knows what is good for her -- and does 
what is best for herself in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of "Scissorhands," Ryder -- tired of the pressures of "carrying" a 
film -- consciously took on a less prominent role than she had in previous 
movies: "Lucas" (her first movie, shot during her eighth-grade summer 
</P>
<P>
vacation), "Square Dance" (in which the 14-year-old Ryder gave Jason Robards 
and Jane Alexander a run for their money); the controversial, morally ambiguous 
"Heathers" (in which she took high school high jinks to new heights) and, more 
recently, "Welcome Back, Roxy Carmichael" (disappointing both personally and 
commercially). 
</P>
<P>
"Scissorhands" proved to be a much happier experience but presented its own 
particular challenges. "It would have been easier to hate her character because 
of the negative way she treated Edward at first," says Depp. "Winona walked a 
fine line. She played it so that the audience knows that her's was the only 
honest reaction -- that everyone else was treating him like a toy." 
</P>
<P>
"The story is a great combination of the mythic and the human," says Ryder, a 
spark lighting up her brown doe-eyes. ("You could dive into them and never 
leave," says a clearly smitten Depp). " 'Edward Scissorhands' is a beautiful, 
Gothic, romantic story with a lot of real-life feeling. Edward expresses the 
negative self-image possessed by so many -- especially in adolescence. The 
desperate feeling that everything you do is wrong, everything you touch you 
destroy." 
</P>
<P>
Burton says that her cheerleader role was the toughest Ryder has yet tackled -- 
a marked contrast to her trademark teen-in-torment roles. (Cher jokingly 
suggested that Ryder name her production company Teen Angst.) Alien turf for 
someone who had never "done the high school thing" . . . or even gone to a 
prom. 
</P>
<P>
"The part wasn't Shakespeare or Joan of Arc, but a definite stretch for someone 
who instinctively moves closer to the dark than the light," Burton observes. 
"Winona felt very uncomfortable in her clothes. She had a real identity crisis, 
but still exhibited a real power and total believability. That's what I counted 
on. Just like in 'Beetlejuice,' I needed somebody to ground the movie so it 
wouldn't spring off into the stratosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Ryder's own childhood was, in fact, the polar opposite of the pastel-colored 
tract houses and suburban mores depicted in "Scissorhands." Moving to San 
Francisco from Winona, Minn., (for which she was named) while still an infant, 
she was one of four children reared by progressive, socially conscious parents. 
For a year, they all shared a 
</P>
<P>
300-acre plot with seven other families in the northern California town of Elk 
before moving to Petaluma where her family still lives. Imagination flourished 
in the absence of television. Eminences such as poet Allen Ginsberg drifted in 
and out. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Michael Horowitz, a San Francisco bookstore owner specializing in 
'60s fare, served as archivist to Timothy Leary (Winona's godfather). Mother 
Cindy, who makes educational videos, once converted a barn into a movie house 
where young Winona and the locals soaked up old films. "Winona has references 
beyond her years," notes director Benjamin. "She'll be bopping along and will 
suddenly observe that that's how Myrna Loy turned around in 'The Best Years of 
Our Lives.' " 
</P>
<P>
A voracious reader and a straight-A student, Ryder sprinkles her conversation 
with allusions to Gore Vidal, Louisa May Alcott and George Orwell (not just 
"1984," but "Down and Out in Paris and London"). J.D. Salinger is her patron 
saint, "Catcher in the Rye" her bible -- a book she's read, she swears, a 
couple of hundred times. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 13, Ryder enrolled in acting classes in San Francisco's 
prestigious American Conservatory Theater. She lost out on a part in the film 
"Desert Bloom" to Annabeth Gish, but the impressed casting agent sent her tape 
to Triad Artists, which agreed to represent her. A substantial role in "Lucas" 
soon followed and the offers have been coming in ever since. "I never had to do 
the Hollywood thing -- to move to L.A., to do commercials or sitcoms," Ryder 
notes. "That probably pisses people off. But I've worked really hard. I'm not 
going to apologize for not struggling." 
</P>
<P>
Ryder describes herself as "obsessive," someone who experiences things 
intensely for awhile before latching on to her next fixation. "I'm moody that 
way," she says. "I need to keep changing and consuming in order to stay happy." 
</P>
<P>
Acting, however, took hold for good, becoming an all-consuming passion. 
"Sometimes I think it's an outlet, sometimes the opposite," she says. "It fills 
me up and I don't know where to put it. I guess I sweat it out in my sleep or 
something. It's great concentrating so hard you feel your brain will explode. 
When I'm acting well, it's the most exhilarating experience. When I'm bad, it's 
miserable. I feel like I'm lying to people . . . and that I have to finish 
lying so that I -- and they -- can go home. I feel like I'm gypping people, 
wasting their time." 
</P>
<P>
That's a rare occurrence according, to colleagues. By all accounts, she's a 
natural. No talking to herself. No breathing exercises or transcendental 
meditation. "Winona and I have the same acting style," observes Cher. "There's 
a sparseness to it and she prepares very little. She just goes out and does. 
Having so little life experience can be a blessing." Music, a central 
ingredient in Ryder's life, helps put her in the mood. For her dramatic role in 
"Beetlejuice," it was opera; for the ethereal "Scissorhands," the Cocteau 
Twins. 
</P>
<P>
On "Mermaids," the Replacements' "Sixteen Blue" brought her back to the 
insecurities of that age. Before playing Charlotte, a Jewish teen going through 
a Catholic phase, Ryder read up on the saints, wore a cross and tried to pray, 
though she didn't know how. 
</P>
<P>
She also got in touch with the character's desperation -- her struggle with her 
burgeoning sexuality and her fear of turning into her racy, off-the-wall 
mother, Mrs. Flax (whose idea of a home-cooked meal is "finger foods"). "They 
loved each other in spite of it all," observes Ryder. "It's hard being a 
mother, hard being a daughter . . . and it doesn't come with a book of 
instructions." 
</P>
<P>
The shoot, it turned out, proved to be a baptism by fire. Director No. 1 Lasse 
Hallstrom ("My Life as a Dog") was banished when he determined to have the 
character of Charlotte's younger sister (Christina Ricci) commit suicide -- a 
plot twist deemed far-fetched by Cher. Frank Oz ("Little Shop of Horrors"), 
director No. 2, tried to turn the drama into "Greek tragedy," says Cher, devoid 
of irony and comedy. Emily Lloyd, initially lined up for the role of Charlotte, 
was replaced by Ryder, who, according to Cher, was considered a better genetic 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
"Noni and I had some catastrophic days and we cried a lot," Cher says. "Both of 
us were insecure being told that our instincts weren't on target. Noni was 
battling insomnia and chewing her nails up to her elbow. If I wasn't so strong 
and she so trusting we would never have gotten through it. I literally took her 
by the hand and said 'jump' -- and she did. We were like sisters. We lived 
together, hung out a lot, and got a lot of strength from each other." Depp, who 
visited the set intermittently, remembers it well. "There were a lot of 
long-distance phone calls," he says. "A lot of Ma Bell. Cher was a real rock 
for Winona, a pretty tough lady. I wouldn't want to go rounds with her." 
</P>
<P>
Though Ryder downplays her role in the turmoil, producer Patrick Palmer does 
not. "Winona led to Frank's leaving as much as Cher did," he states, referring 
to Oz's dismissal. "I was surprised she articulated things so well." The 
arrival of Richard Benjamin improved things considerably, but the shoot still 
proved to be an ordeal. It was the coldest December ever recorded in Boston and 
the 12- and 14-hour workdays didn't help. Ryder, prone to anemia, was so wiped 
out, recalls Palmer, that the production was postponed a week to let her 
regroup. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting the crucial sex scene proved embarrassing for Ryder -- "I was ready to 
pull out an ax and hack people if they looked at me funny." Recording the 
movie's voice-over was another thorn in her side. "I'm used to being told what 
to say, but not what to think . . . that's usually left up to me." Still she 
says, she's basically pleased with the film. "It has a lot of heart, I think." 
</P>
<P>
It was Ryder's next project, "The Godfather, Part III," that pushed her over 
the top. Mere mention of the film causes her to shut her eyes in pain. She had 
the role of a lifetime: playing Al Pacino's daughter in Francis Ford Coppola's 
sequel to two movies that had each won the best-picture Oscar. And Ryder backed 
out (to be replaced by Coppola's daughter, Sofia). There was talk of a nervous 
breakdown, rumors of pregnancy. Some say she had doubts about the role and, 
after working almost a year nonstop, just wanted some balance back in her life. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says a plainly wounded Ryder. "The whole thing has been blown out of 
proportion," she claims. "I'd done three films in a row: 'Great Balls of Fire,' 
'. . . Roxy Carmichael' and 'Mermaids.' Right after ("Mermaids") wrapped, I 
flew to Rome with a terrible upper-respiratory infection and a 104-degree 
fever. I literally couldn't move. The studio doctor told me to go home, said I 
was too sick to work. It wasn't my choice. It was out of my hands. Sure it's 
disappointing, devastating in fact. I wish it didn't happen . . . but it did." 
</P>
<P>
"Mermaids" producer Palmer recalls advising Ryder to go ahead with the project, 
arguing that it was an American classic she shouldn't throw away. Her agent 
called her father, predicting that, if she jumped ship, she'd never work again. 
(Ryder now has a different agent.) Cher, however, took her side, maintaining 
that Coppola would understand. "Noni was fried, really fried," she says. "She's 
not a flake, but you can't wring out a wet rag. She's just a little girl . . . 
not a superwoman. And you can't start a film on 'empty.' " 
</P>
<P>
The tabloids and gossip columnists smelled blood -- one aspect of fame, says 
Ryder, that she still finds bothersome. "When I was young, I was the sweetheart 
of the press," says this veteran of nine Hollywood films. "They loved me, but 
were kind of waiting for me to mess up. I had no skeletons in my closet, no 
major past to talk about. I wasn't with anyone and didn't fall into that Drew 
Barrymore drug syndrome. Then I became engaged to Johnny and it's been bad ever 
since. Our relationship, fortunately, is a pretty solid one. If it was shaky, 
we'd be screwed. Michelle Pfeiffer said in an interview that she acts for free, 
but demands huge amounts of money for having to live in the public eye. She hit 
it on the head." 
</P>
<P>
Ryder bristles when asked about her two-year relationship with the 27-year-old 
Depp and the significance of that diamond on her left hand. "I get very 
protective because people try to categorize it. They see us as young actors 
doing that Hollywood-type thing. I hate labels. Johnny's my friend. We are in 
love. We're 'engaged' . . . but it's deeper than that. He's part of me, 
important to me right now." 
</P>
<P>
The two of them split their time between San Francisco -- Ryder's favorite city 
("What other one would name a street after Jack Kerouac?") -- a loft in New 
York and a new home she just purchased in Beverly Hills. Work, for the moment, 
has been put on hold so she can read, write (she keeps a journal and has 
written a screenplay) and relax with Depp. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a fine line between the excitement of doing some good work and taking 
care not to destroy yourself," says director Burton. "Winona is smart. Winona 
is sensitive. She knows she has to protect herself more and take it a little 
easier. She realizes she's been pushing too hard." 
</P>
<P>
Come January, however, Ryder will plunge in again, putting in a couple of weeks 
as a taxi driver in a movie by Jim Jarmusch ("Down by Law"). Though there are 
no plans beyond that, those around her doubt she has much to worry about. 
"Unlike Molly Ringwald, I don't think she'll have trouble making the transition 
to romantic roles," says Palmer. "She's sexual in her own way and can move 
right on to those Julia Roberts parts." 
</P>
<P>
Depp foresees even greater things. "Winona may be the Lillian Gish of the next 
century," he gushes. "I see her in 2040 still doing movies. She's got that much 
time and energy left . . . and it's hard to calm her down when she likes 
something."

CITY COUNCIL: SOME ARE AT WORK MANEUVERING TO SEIZE THE AILING COUNCILMAN'S 
KINGDOM, THE 'GREAT 9TH.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Gil Lindsay ran downtown Los Angeles as if the money and the power would never 
run out. He had a Southern senator's gift of gab and a gunslinger's arrogance. 
When he wanted contributions, the 9th District city councilman brashly rang up 
developers and investment bankers and told them to get out their checkbooks. 
</P>
<P>
For 27 years, Lindsay called the shots downtown and shaped the soaring Los 
Angeles skyline. He has thrived on flattery and the doting of young women. He 
called himself "the Emperor" and dubbed his inner-city district the "Great 
9th." Old-timers in City Hall say he was the closest thing they have seen to 
the late Chicago political boss Richard J. Daley. 
</P>
<P>
Today, all that is over for Gilbert William Lindsay. At 90, the city's first 
black councilman is in the twilight of his imperious reign, and his world is 
crumbling around him.Lindsay hangs onto life, and onto elected office, at Queen 
of Angels/Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, incapacitated by a stroke that 
felled him Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to sit up and unable to speak, he is kept virtually without visitors. 
Lindsay's political war chest, which used to bulge with tens or hundreds of 
thousands of dollars, is all but empty. Contributions this year total zero. A 
former girlfriend controls much of his personal real estate. While those who 
love him bemoan Lindsay's loss of dignity, others are at work maneuvering to 
seize his kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
The final chapter of the Lindsay era presents a strange, unsavory lesson in Los 
Angeles politics. No one will come out and say it, but many people believe that 
Lindsay has outlived his time. In the midst of the prayers and testimonials, 
cronies and constituents anxiously await the moment when the district and its 
biggest prize, downtown Los Angeles, becomes officially up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
During Lindsay's absence, would-be successors have met quietly with community 
leaders, soliciting support. Power brokers have begun to talk of carving up the 
Great 9th. Latino activists, alert to the city's shifting population, have 
started looking forward to a battle for control of the once-overwhelmingly 
black district. 
</P>
<P>
Even Lindsay's frail body has been viewed as a political chess piece. As the 
council counted the days he had been hospitalized in Inglewood -- 60 days 
outside city limits would have allowed his ouster -- Lindsay was loaded, mouth 
agape, into an ambulance and transported to a hospital inside the city. The 
clock stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Though city officials, including Mayor Tom Bradley, remain uncertain about 
whether, or how, to remove Lindsay from office, it is increasingly evident that 
they are not ready to embrace a new emperor. This is not good news for 
Lindsay's political protege and onetime heir-apparent, chief deputy Bob Gay. 
Like Lindsay, Gay started out as a janitor. He is 37, black, smart, articulate, 
and he grew up just three blocks from Lindsay's longtime residence on 52nd 
Place. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Gay is the target of critics who say he is too eager to slide onto 
Lindsay's throne and assume the role of big-city boss. Last week, the Bradley 
Administration made a move calculated to prevent Gay from gaining any advantage 
over others who might be interested in succeeding Lindsay. Bradley voiced his 
opposition to a plan to permit the appointment of a temporary replacement for 
Lindsay. Gay was seen by many in City Hall as the obvious candidate. 
</P>
<P>
It now appears that the contest to replace Lindsay is wide open, though more 
than one council member suggests it is possible that the emperor will finish 
the remaining two years of his term. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is Lindsay's legacy -- a district that he built from obscurity into 
one of the richest commercial enclaves in the country. With its cultural 
diversity, its extremes of corporate wealth and ghetto poverty, Lindsay's Great 
9th came to look like Los Angeles in miniature. From Chinatown, Little Tokyo 
and the towering financial district on the north, the district extends south 
through the well-worn streets of South-Central Los Angeles to Central Avenue, 
the cradle of black culture and politics in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay was almost unassailable in the 9th, doubly fortified by contributions 
from downtown developers and black votes from South-Central. Changing 
demographics raise the possibility that the district could be broken into two 
or more pieces during the coming redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
The district's long-dominant black population is barely a majority. 
Demographers predict blacks will be surpassed by Latinos before the end of the 
decade. The trend heightens speculation that at least a portion of the district 
will wind up in the hands of a Latino councilman, someone such as Richard 
Alatorre, who has made no secret of his interest in representing downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The breakup of the district could cost blacks one of the three council seats 
they hold and, by splitting off the downtown, make it harder for poor 
neighborhoods in the southern half of the district to tap into the millions of 
tax dollars generated by new construction in the central business district. 
</P>
<P>
"With anyone in there but a strong incumbent, (the district) will be carved 
up," one former council member said. "A lot of people think it's too great a 
concentration of power to remain in any one council member's hands." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the district is kept intact, voters are likely to join the call for a 
new style of leadership, one oriented more toward pressing social issues such 
as jobs, employment, gang wars and low-cost housing. Even as the emperor 
lingers, some constituents have begun to reassess his reign. 
</P>
<P>
"When Mr. Lindsay was in good health, he wasn't always providing us with what 
we wanted," said Estelle van Meter, who runs a senior citizens' center. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay was born in 1900 in Mississippi, and increasingly has been seen as a 
political relic, especially among younger constituents. Community leaders 
revolted a few years ago when Lindsay supported plans for construction of the 
giant trash-to-energy Lancer incinerator project, which was seen as a health 
threat to the poor communities that would border it. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Lindsay opposed handgun control even though violent crime rages in 
parts of his district. "I'm liberal, but I'm not a phony," Lindsay once told an 
interviewer. "I haven't gotten so liberal that I can't enjoy Old Glory as my 
flag and my country." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay reveled in the city's growth and, in an era when younger politicians 
fret about the environmental consequences of growth, big has never been quite 
big enough for Lindsay. At last year's dedication of the city's tallest 
building, the 73-story First Interstate World Center Tower, Lindsay called for 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I told them to build a 100-story building. What happened?" he 
quipped to the crowd. "I like big deals. Big things. Big everything." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Lindsay has been a wheeler-dealer. If you wanted to build something 
downtown, Gil was the man to see. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who criticize the way Lindsay has exercised his power acknowledge 
that his illness has created a vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners and developers alike complain that the district is being ignored. 
"So much crime out here -- the gangs, the drugs -- we just can't do without a 
representative," Van Meter said. 
</P>
<P>
"His presence . . . is greatly missing," said George Mihlsten, an attorney and 
lobbyist representing major downtown developers. "Without a steady hand and a 
clear vision for where downtown is going and should go, downtown will suffer." 
</P>
<P>
The question of the powerful man's fate has swung the spotlight onto a 
reluctant City Council and a number of would-be successors, most notably Gay. 
</P>
<P>
"Gil Lindsay has honed and developed everything I know and understand about 
politics, about government, (about) what's right and what's wrong," Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
Powerful factions at City Hall seem keenly aware of the similarities. 
</P>
<P>
"With an old man you say, 'That's fine. That's the way (politics) used to be, 
and he's not going to be around for very long,' " one council member said, 
asking not to be identified. "But a young man, he's going to be here for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
Gay's role during Lindsay's hospitalization has been a source of controversy. 
On the night of the stroke, Lindsay was rushed to Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Medical Center in Inglewood, outside Los Angeles boundaries but close to his 
home. He remained there for nearly a month, despite written instructions saying 
he should receive emergency care at Queen of Angels/Hollywood Presbyterian. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gay's critics, the circumstances opened the door for the deputy's 
possible rise to power by allowing the council to invoke the 60-day absentee 
provision of the City Charter. Suspicions were heightened because calls about 
Lindsay's condition were routed to Gay and the councilman was allowed few 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Gay denies exercising influence over his boss' hospitalization, saying that all 
the medical and visitation decisions were made by doctors and by Lindsay's 
stepson, Herbert Howard -- who happens to work for Lindsay's office. Howard 
insisted that the decisions were strictly medical: "Everyone seems to think it 
was political -- that's nonsense," he said. "The primary thing on my mind was, 
and is, my father's health." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay's closest friends became increasingly worried about the effects of 
isolation on a man who thrived in the company of well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
"He hated to be alone," said former Councilman Art Snyder. "The very idea of 
his lying there alone, staring at the ceiling, could be enough to drive him 
insane." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay's image had begun to suffer even before his latest stroke. Also, The 
Times reported in late November that Lindsay had signed over control of two 
commercial lots and at least one of his three homes to 39-year-old Juanda 
Chauncie. Chauncie, who claimed that Lindsay left her for a younger woman, was 
in court trying to evict an elderly couple from Lindsay's former house. 
Meanwhile, the councilman, who had suffered a minor stroke in 1988, was quoted 
as being confused about one of the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"Did I get my money?" Lindsay had asked repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
With the 60 days about half gone, the council grappled hesitantly with 
questions of deposing the old firebrand: What were the legal ramifications? Who 
would replace him? Would there be an appointment? A special election? In the 
meantime, who was representing the district? 
</P>
<P>
Meetings were called from City Hall to South-Central, seeking answers. Some of 
the meetings were less than pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
At one, about 100 frustrated residents gathered at a church hall to press their 
demands on a representative of the city legislative analyst's office -- which 
technically is running the district. The representative did not show up. Gay 
did. 
</P>
<P>
His efforts to appease the angry crowd were rebuffed. The meeting was scheduled 
to last two hours but ended in an uproar in only 30 minutes. Much of that time 
was spent debating whether Gay should be permitted to speak. In the end, he was 
not. 
</P>
<P>
"It was ugly," Gay conceded later, describing the affair as a political ambush 
engineered by other council aspirants. "The meeting was intended to embarrass 
me, to deal me a blow. And I sat there and took it all." 
</P>
<P>
At another meeting, held the same day, City Atty. James K. Hahn was visited in 
his City Hall office by council President John Ferraro and several ministers 
prominent in the black community. The community leaders wanted the city 
attorney to find a way to keep Lindsay in office, allowing for his political 
successor to be chosen through an election. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said he replied that it was possible for the City Council to excuse the 
absence any time before the 60-day clock ran out. Before the council could 
convene again, Lindsay was transported to Queen of Angels/Hollywood 
Presbyterian. It was left for followers of the saga to speculate over the 
move's timing. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Gay, two others are frequently mentioned as possible Lindsay 
successors: Brad Pye, a deputy to County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, and Woody 
Fleming, a union official. Others are expected to enter the fray. 
</P>
<P>
The field is considered wide open in part because Bradley, according to sources 
close to the mayor, has not decided on whom to support. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have had ample time to think about the future of the 9th 
District. Lindsay's health has declined for several years, causing bouts of 
fatigue, confusion and frequent absences from the council. Lindsay has needed a 
full-time paid escort for much of the last two years to assist him at City 
Hall, and he has had to rely on his aides at times to help him vote correctly 
on routine matters. 
</P>
<P>
But council members have been reluctant to deal with Lindsay's decline, not 
just out of deference. Lindsay was -- and is -- a feared man at City Hall. "One 
thing you never want to do with Gil," one associate said in 1975, "is cross 
him. . . . He doesn't hold a grudge, but he remembers." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, his colleagues are hesitant about closing the book too early on 
Lindsay. A close friend, Councilman Nate Holden, can imagine Lindsay returning 
-- unable to speak, sitting in a wheelchair, the old emperor scrawling notes 
and exacting his political vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
"He would be pretty mad about what we've done to him."

ANGLO VOTE MAY BE PIVOTAL IN HEAVILY LATINO 1ST DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After finally succeeding in a decades-long battle for a predominantly Latino 
supervisorial district, Latino voting-rights activists now are confronted with 
a bitter paradox: The Anglo vote may well prove pivotal in the Jan. 22 special 
election intended to select a Latino for the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
This political irony is grounded in numbers -- a combination of demographics 
and voter turnout trends -- and helps explain why Latino candidates 
traditionally have fared poorly in major California elections. 
</P>
<P>
The newly drawn 1st District is 71% Latino with about 1.2 million Latino 
residents, making it the largest bloc of Latino voters ever assembled for a 
local election in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
However, even though Latinos are the overwhelming majority in the new district, 
they are only a narrow majority -- 51% -- of the registered voters. And Latinos 
traditionally turn out in lower numbers on Election Day. Anglo voters make up 
about 40% of the district's registered voters, Asians 6% and blacks 3%. 
</P>
<P>
With the campaign only 10 weeks long, the four major candidates -- all of whom 
are Latinos -- are foregoing efforts to register large numbers of Latino 
voters. Instead, they are relying on direct-mail campaigns to target 
"high-propensity voters," those who have cast ballots in several past 
elections. But only 38% of these sure-shot voters are Latino, according to one 
recent survey. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a horse race that you really don't have the ability to carry out the 
responsibility that you feel to bring (Latino) voters back into the system," 
said Dina Huniu, campaign manger for state Sen. Charles M. Calderon 
(D-Whittier). 
</P>
<P>
In a civil rights lawsuit, Latino activists successfully argued that the 
all-Anglo Board of Supervisors historically created district lines that 
discriminated against Latino candidates. A federal judge approved new district 
boundaries and scheduled an election for Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
But the lawsuit did nothing to change the tactics used by the political 
machinery that dominates major campaigns in California and elsewhere. Latino 
voting-rights activists say Latinos get short shrift as hundreds of thousands 
of dollars are spent in direct-mail campaigns directed mainly to Anglo voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike other southwestern states, the Latino vote in California is not highly 
regarded by the political consultants and the political leadership," said 
Richard Martinez of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project. 
</P>
<P>
"The most common tactic is for the candidates to say that the turnout will be 
low," Martinez said. "And they say getting out the Latino vote will be an extra 
cost beyond the campaign budget." 
</P>
<P>
The four major candidates in the race are Calderon; Sarah Flores (a former aide 
to Supervisor Pete Schabarum); Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, and 
state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
All four are making a concerted effort to expand their support in more racially 
mixed suburbs -- such as Hacienda Heights, Monterey Park and Whittier -- in the 
eastern half of the district. 
</P>
<P>
They have established their campaign headquarters in suburban communities, not 
in the overwhelmingly Latino barrios of East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights and 
Westlake that are the heart of Southern California's Spanish-speaking 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't describe this district in one word; we can't say it's the 'Latino 
district,' " said Pat Bond, a political consultant for Molina. "The actual 
population is overwhelmingly Latino, but the voters are a much more diverse 
universe. (Latino voters) make up a big part of the district, but they are in 
no way overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
During the first full weekend of campaigning after the Nov. 30 filing deadline, 
Molina sent most of her volunteers to work in the San Gabriel Valley, 
considered the stronghold of Flores and Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Smith, political consultant to Flores, has taken pains to express his 
candidate's commitment to Anglo and Asian voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the difference between Sarah and all the other candidates," he 
said. "We have said we have to appeal to everybody and others are gearing their 
campaigns just to Latino voters." 
</P>
<P>
With the impact of the Latino vote uncertain, the candidates are tailoring 
their message to a broad constituency of Latino, Anglo, Asian and black voters. 
They seem reluctant to portray themselves as "the Latino candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they say the concerns of Latino voters -- principally crime and gang 
violence -- are shared by all voters, regardless of race. 
</P>
<P>
Even the large number of Latino candidates works against the Latino vote 
becoming a dominant factor in the election. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, the election would be won within the Hispanic community," said 
John Palacio, a Santa Ana-based political consultant. "But because you have a 
large number of Hispanic candidates who are well known, it would seem that none 
of them is going to run away with the Hispanic vote. They will probably try to 
keep close in the Hispanic vote and make their strongest effort to reach Anglo 
voters." 
</P>
<P>
Low voter registration and voter turnout are common in Latino communities in 
Southern California. Several campaign insiders said they expect voter turnout 
for the Jan. 22 election to run between 14% and 20%. By contrast, voter turnout 
in the gubernatorial election last month was 59% statewide and 57% in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The 1st District overlaps the East Los Angeles-based state Senate, Assembly and 
congressional districts, which have the lowest percentage of registered voters 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The 56th Assembly District, for example, has fewer than half as many registered 
voters as the adjacent 59th Assembly District, centered in the San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Latinos don't have a strong voting history," Martinez said. "That's because 
past candidates have not taken the vote seriously and have not made the 
investment necessary to get that vote out. What candidates have done in the 
past is to try and get the Latino vote that comes out and not increase the 
number of Latino voters coming out." 
</P>
<P>
Latino activists shaped the new 1st District boundaries with a voter 
registration campaign in mind, said Leo Estrada, a UCLA demographer who helped 
develop the redistricting plan that was finally adopted by U.S. District Judge 
David V. Kenyon. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the district was designed to include the home turf of 
community-based organizations -- such as Mothers of East Los Angeles -- that 
could provide foot soldiers for a mass registration effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought that a voter registration campaign would be the icing on the cake 
necessary for Latinos to dominate the vote," Estrada said. "But now there's no 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The deadline to register voters for the election is Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Given the short campaign, Estrada said, it was inevitable that the candidates 
would focus on wooing voters outside the Latino community and Latino voters who 
are already registered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a strategy that has been forced upon them and that may come back to haunt 
them," Estrada said. "One thing they cannot afford to do is have the Latino 
community feel they are going to be ignored." 
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he expected a higher than average Latino voter turnout Jan. 22 
because of publicity surrounding the voter discrimination lawsuit. Whether 
Latinos would turn out in equally high numbers for a runoff election is a 
question, he said. A runoff is scheduled Feb. 19 if no candidate wins a 
majority of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a runoff, there could be a huge downfall in terms of Latino 
votes," Estrada said, because the Latino vote traditionally declines in runoff 
elections. "Anglos who vote consistently could have the greater impact in the 
runoff stage." 
</P>
<P>
A few of the many problems causing low Latino voter participation were clear 
one recent weekend afternoon when two Molina volunteers walked the streets of 
Los Angeles County precinct 1859 in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Clara Solis, 30, and Jeff Hernandez, 26, used a list of registered voters to 
target the homes they would visit. Their primary goal: to persuade voters to 
fill out applications for absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Most conspicuous were the residences the volunteers ignored because they didn't 
appear on the list. They walked past most of the homes with children, and 
almost all of the homes where Spanish rancheras and corridos were blaring from 
living-room stereos. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll notice that we're skipping a lot of homes," Hernandez said. "One of the 
things you notice when you're doing voter registration in these neighborhoods 
is that there's a high percentage of non-citizens. You start to go through your 
rap in Spanish, you realize that they would register if they could, but they 
can't." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the volunteers could take heart from words of support offered them by 
69-year-old Alberto Medina, a U.S. citizen who spent most of his life raising a 
family in northern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I always vote for the Latinos, even if I know they're going to lose," he said 
in Spanish. "But maybe this time we'll win."

PLUMBING CLOG MAY CUT LENGTH OF ASTRO MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HUNTSVILLE, Ala. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mission to explore the heavens is expected to end a day early because of the 
most down-to-earth reason: The space shuttle's toilet is jammed. 
</P>
<P>
"The plumbing is stopped up," declared chief flight director Randy Stone. "And 
there's no Roto-Rooter." 
</P>
<P>
Unless someone figures out how to empty the shuttle's holding tank, the 
Columbia will have to land Monday night instead of Tuesday, curtailing the long 
awaited Astro astronomy mission that was just hitting high gear Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision on landing early, expected to be made this afternoon, could be 
another blow to scientists, who have been on an emotional roller coaster. The 
mission recovered miraculously Friday after teetering on the brink of failure 
Thursday when the second of two computers that command the Columbia's 
telescopes failed. 
</P>
<P>
A program involving literally hundreds of workers resolved that problem when 
control of the telescopes was taken over by technicians on the ground, with a 
little help from the four astronomers who are in the shuttle's seven-man crew. 
</P>
<P>
The mood of the entire mission was summed up earlier by Randy Kimble, an 
astronomer at Johns Hopkins University, who bemoaned: "If you don't like your 
mood now, wait 10 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
The news that they were expected to lose a full day of observations came just 
hours after scientists announced several dramatic discoveries. The historic 
mission has placed telescopes in orbit where they are able to study the 
universe in light that does not reach the ground, giving scientists a chance to 
look at celestial targets in ways that they have never been seen before. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday morning, one scientist, Frank Marshall of the Goddard Space Flight 
Center in Greenbelt, Md., announced results that could help scientists in their 
long quest to define the "dark matter" that makes up at least 90% of the 
universe but cannot be seen. Then he was told that the mission would probably 
be cut one day short. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be greatly disappointed," he said. "We are looking forward to every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
But a noble search for answers to cosmic questions appeared headed for an early 
end because of the blockage of a small pipe from the Columbia's holding tank to 
a nozzle that spews waste water into space. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to speculate what's in there clogging it up," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
The tank holds only about 20 gallons, and it must be dumped once a day. In 
addition to its obvious contents, it also holds moisture removed from the air 
inside the cabin. That keeps the humidity in check, and if the humidity rises 
too much it could cause problems for the critical electronics gear aboard the 
shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
The crew is now using a plastic bag that holds about the same amount as the 
holding tank, but the bag and the tank only have enough room to take care of 
needs through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Stone said the crew was not being asked to make any sacrifices, such as 
consuming less water. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be non-productive from a physiological point of view," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists were already expecting to miss some of their observations because of 
problems in controlling the telescopes, but the results that have been achieved 
have left them ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
In a briefing Saturday, Marshall said that an X-ray telescope aboard Columbia 
provided clues about the "invisible universe." Astronomers know that most of 
the mass of the universe cannot be seen. When they look at galaxies of swirling 
stars, they can infer that the galaxies must have far more mass than can be 
seen or they would not have enough gravity to keep from flying apart. That is 
known as the mass-to-light ratio. 
</P>
<P>
The X-ray telescope allows astronomers to determine the temperature of very hot 
objects, and Marshall said the instrument "provided the first good temperature" 
reading of gas swirling around a galaxy known as NGC 1399. It turns out that 
the gas was exceedingly hot, and that measurement allows scientists to 
determine how fast atoms within the gas are moving, the so-called thermal 
velocity. 
</P>
<P>
The velocity in turn tells scientists how much mass is present, because if the 
atoms were moving fast enough they would escape from the system, just as a 
spacecraft that achieves its "escape velocity" can fly free of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The telescope told Marshall that the temperature of the gas around NGC 1399 is 
so hot that the atoms are moving so fast that the galaxy must have at least 20 
times more mass than had been thought. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some dark mass there that has not been detected by any other 
instrument," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As they study the data collected by the X-ray telescope, scientists expect to 
be able to determine something about the mysterious dark matter. 
</P>
<P>
"There is hope that we may be able to measure the distribution of the dark 
matter -- where it is in the galaxy," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists will spend the next few weeks, and possibly even years, studying the 
data for answers to questions about mysterious objects, or materials, that 
cannot be seen. 
</P>
<P>
But waiting, for many of them, is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Moos of the Hopkins team said he has been waiting for more than a decade 
for data collected early Saturday by the Hopkins telescope. The instrument, 
which determines the chemical composition of distant objects by analyzing the 
light they emit, focused on one of the most enigmatic objects in the solar 
system, Jupiter's volcanic moon, Io. 
</P>
<P>
The Voyager spacecraft visited Io in 1979 and found sulfur volcanoes spewing 
gas high into the region above Io, creating a doughnut of gas around Jupiter in 
the path followed by the active moon. 
</P>
<P>
Since that discovery, scientists have been trying to understand how the 
volcanoes work. It would be easier to figure it all out if scientists could 
tell how much of which chemical elements are in the doughnut around Jupiter, 
because that would tell them much about the dynamics of the system, but the 
data was not good enough, Moos said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hopkins telescope, by contrast, supplied enough information that Moos said 
he and his colleagues "have got the total picture." 
</P>
<P>
"This was the missing key," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moos talked with reporters after spending the preceding 12 hours nursing the 
experiment, and, like nearly everyone associated with the Astro observatory, he 
was nearing exhaustion. He would not even guess when he will finish analyzing 
his data. He said it could take years. 
</P>
<P>
But at least he has what he needs now. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been waiting 10 years to get it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the mission has to be shortened by one day, the telescopes will have to be 
packed away early Monday morning in time for Columbia skipper Vance Brand to 
land the spacecraft at Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California just 
before 10 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The other members of the Columbia's crew are Guy S. Gardner, the pilot; 
civilian astronomers Samuel T. Durrance and Ronald A. Parise, and astronauts 
Robert Parker, John M. (Mike) Lounge and Jeffrey A. Hoffman. Parker and Hoffman 
are also astronomers. 
</P>
<P>
The science mission is being controlled from the Marshall Space Flight Center 
here.

ANIMOSITY TOWARD THOSE WHO ARE 'DIFFERENT' INCREASINGLY TURNS FROM THOUGHT TO 
DEED. ONE CONFRONTATION OFFERS A CASE STUDY IN THE NATURE AND CONSEQUENCES OF 
PREJUDICE.

The encounter at a phone booth on a breezy summer night lasted less than 20 
minutes. But it was decades in the making and, more than a year later, is 
reverberating still. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny James McCool Jr., 19, was calling a friend from a gas station in the 
Montrose section of Glendale when the telephone was snatched, hard, from his 
hand. He turned to face the blue-eyed stare of a short, curly-haired man he had 
never met before. 
</P>
<P>
The man, later identified as Ralph Tavlian, wanted to know why McCool had 
thrown something at him. McCool said he hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
What Tavlian yelled next is recorded in Glendale Police Department report 
724-054: 
</P>
<P>
"Nigger, you don't belong in this city. We don't need people like you here." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he slapped Johnny McCool. Then he smacked the astonished 
young man again and again. 
</P>
<P>
As crimes go, this was a minor case. No one was badly hurt (McCool was bruised; 
his striped turtleneck torn). No deadly weapons were involved (Tavlian did not 
even make a fist). 
</P>
<P>
But it was just the kind of episode that illustrates the scale and nature of 
prejudice today. Increasingly, ill will toward others has crossed the chasm 
between thought and deed. 
</P>
<P>
"Hate crimes" have been reported at record rates in Los Angeles County each 
year since 1986. Other Southern California counties have not been keeping 
separate hate-crime figures, although authorities in Orange County say they 
sense an increase there. But wherever such statistics are kept, across the 
United States, bigotry cases have become more commonplace, according to Leonard 
Zeskind, research director of the Center for Democratic Renewal, which monitors 
hate crimes nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents have ranged from anonymous spray-painting of slurs to cross 
burnings to murder. What they have in common is their motivation: fury directed 
at those who are "different" because of their race, their religion or their 
sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are small compared to some other crime categories, but authorities 
find the direction frightening. In the first half of 1990, the 272 entries in 
the county's hate-crime log represented a 32% jump in reported incidents over 
the same period in 1989. The surge is "a barometer of increasing tension in 
society as a whole," says Eugene Mornell, executive director of the county's 
Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In late 20th-Century Los Angeles, awash in immigrants, there are plenty of 
"different" people around. Each group offers potential victims -- and potential 
aggressors as well. None holds a monopoly on bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks, for example, rank with Jews and male homosexuals as the most frequent 
targets in local hate crimes. In that respect, Johnny McCool's experience was 
typical. 
</P>
<P>
But last month, a black transient screaming, "I hate Mexicans!" used a cinder 
block to bash a Latino to death. 
</P>
<P>
Armenians, too, have been threatened. Last year, a teenager's nose was bloodied 
by several dozen taunting Latina schoolgirls. An Armenian man found three 
deflated tires on his car and, beneath the windshield wiper, a note warning him 
to move out of his apartment. "You stink up our building," the note read in 
part. It was signed, "Ottoman Empire." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Tavlian is Armenian. He says his treatment of Johnny McCool "was the most 
shameful thing I've ever done." He was sodden-drunk at the time. He says he 
swore off alcohol the morning after, when he woke up in jail, and has not 
touched it since -- an account supported by friends and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
He also has spent some time thinking about the roots of his outburst. He says 
alcohol fogged his memory, but concedes that he probably said what he is quoted 
as saying and did what he is accused of doing. The sentiment he expressed "was 
there, yes. It didn't just come from the blue sky," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation at the phone booth, he says, really began 20 years ago, when 
he was Raffi Tawilian, age 12, a new arrival from Lebanon by way of France and 
New York. His family clung to old Armenian ways; he became Ralph, "the 
Americanized one." One way to fit in, he found, was to pick up his classmates' 
chatter about the need to keep their school as white as the teachers' chalk. 
</P>
<P>
After high school, he says, he fell in with a biker gang called the "Dirty 
White Boys." He had the name tattooed across his back. It was a response, he 
says, to a black biker gang known as the "Chosen Few." 
</P>
<P>
On television, in movies, in news accounts, he says, the stereotypes and the 
ugly names were reinforced. "It's crammed down our throats," Ralph Tavlian 
says. "Crammed down our throats, and you can quote me on that." 
</P>
<P>
To hear Johnny McCool Sr. tell it, Johnny Jr.'s first brush with prejudice came 
on the day of his birth back in 1969: 
</P>
<P>
"I told my wife, 'Martha, keep gas in the car.' But she didn't and the car ran 
out in Glendale at 3 o'clock in the morning. I was walking to a gas station 
when a police car pulled over. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Officer, my wife is in labor and we ran out of gas. Could you take me 
to get some gas or take us to the hospital?' The officer started asking me some 
questions. A black man on foot in the middle of the night. He thought I was out 
there stealing or something." 
</P>
<P>
McCool Sr. recognized the attitude. His sensors were always activated. He had 
spent a good bit of time going out of his way to avoid racial problems without 
giving up his pride. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in Drew, Miss., in the Delta and "back in that area, all (a black 
person) was supposed to have was a weak mind and strong back." He couldn't take 
that, but he didn't want to start any incidents either. So he moved to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
House hunting here in 1960, he says, a Crenshaw District realtor told him: 
"Hey, we are not selling to blacks . . . or colored, whatever they said then." 
</P>
<P>
"Why antagonize?" he thought. So he moved to a racially mixed block in Altadena 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he quit his city job driving street sweepers, to open his own mechanic's 
shop and located the business in a predominantly black South-Central Los 
Angeles neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
When the three children came along, he resolved to impart certain lessons. 
Between water skiing, violin practice, judo and church, his middle child and 
namesake received field trips to Skid Row and lectures on race relations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not what you are. It's who you are," McCool Sr. liked to say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not what happens to you; it's how you handle it. 
</P>
<P>
"We got to live in the real world among real people and deal with it as it is, 
not the way we hope it is." 
</P>
<P>
Some people, McCool Sr. told his son as they watched the television miniseries 
"Roots" together, just don't like other races, because of something they saw or 
something their parents told them. 
</P>
<P>
"It went in one ear and out the other," McCool Jr. says now. 
</P>
<P>
After all, McCool Jr. was living in a well-integrated world as he grew into a 
lanky, soft-spoken teen with a wispy mustache. At Pasadena Christian School, he 
met his best friend, a white guy with short blond hair and a dry voice who 
lived in affluent La Canada Flintridge. His name was Bond. James Bond. 
</P>
<P>
They stayed close, even though McCool went on to Marshall High School and Bond 
attended St. Francis. McCool knew that every couple of months or so, others 
asked Bond why he spent so much time with black guys. But he didn't dwell on 
that much, because he also knew about Bond's stock reply: " 'Cause they're not 
. . . like you." Bond filled in the blank with a descriptive swear word. 
</P>
<P>
It was Bond who got McCool involved with the Crescenta-Canada YMCA, a low, 
sprawling brown building on Foothill Boulevard near the Glendale Freeway's 
north end. After two years of Bond's coaxing, McCool began playing basketball 
there. He coached and refereed as well, then acted as disc jockey for 
Y-sponsored dances at local schools. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Bond and McCool enrolled at Pasadena City College, they were Y 
fixtures, working as gymnastics teachers and as counselors for junior high 
school-age teens. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes a whole crowd of Y buddies would cross the Glendale city line to the 
south for a bite to eat in the Montrose shopping district. The place had a 
homey feel. American flags adorned the light standards. The only people 
soliciting spare change on the streets were members of the Lions Club. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly everyone there was white. 
</P>
<P>
By and large, McCool felt more accepted than excepted. Once in a while, though, 
he could tell that whites in town thought of him as different. 
</P>
<P>
A few kids hailed McCool as "cuz" or "blood," as if he belonged to a gang. 
School principals took him aside as he set up for dances, asking him not to 
play too much rap music. And the cops seemed to pull his car over every week. 
Once, McCool recalls, sheriff's deputies said they'd halted him because he was 
driving 41 m.p.h. in a 40-m.p.h. zone. The constant stops ebbed only after he'd 
become well-known locally. "I coached some of their kids," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He really wasn't all that bothered. He has, he concedes, some biases of his 
own. "When I see a Latino or a Chinese driver and don't like the way they're 
driving, you try to blame it on where they come from," he says -- this from a 
young man with a long string of his own parking tickets and moving violations. 
</P>
<P>
Still, his father worried that he was spending so much time in such white 
precincts. He thought his son was courting trouble. "If you eat," McCool Sr. 
says, "you are going to bite your tongue sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Tavlian, the baby in a family of eight children, speaker of Armenian, 
Arabic and French, former resident of Lebanon, France and New York, grew 
skilled early on in the ways of adapting to a new environment. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1970s, he was absorbing the atmosphere at La Canada High School, where 
the prospect of integration was Topic A. 
</P>
<P>
The other kids were always saying things like, "They'll never bring niggers to 
our school." 
</P>
<P>
In class, "we learned that blacks were bought and sold . . . they were slaves 
(once)," Tavlian recalls. He drew a conclusion. "They must be inferior. That 
sticks." 
</P>
<P>
He had nothing in particular against black people, he says. He didn't know any. 
But he figured -- he still figures -- "they use the word nigger on TV in this 
country. That's what everybody else in this country calls them." 
</P>
<P>
He does not claim to have ever been a saint. He had a drug problem, he says, 
though he is not forthcoming with details. He hung out with a motorcycle gang 
in Tujunga and did time in Chino for robbery. In prison, he lifted weights with 
the black guys. It was his first real contact with the people he'd heard so 
much about. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the resentment they have toward the white person," he says. "And 
they're a lot more open about it than whites. We're the blue-eyed devil. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He returned to what had become his home turf in the foothills. He was a laborer 
for a while in Glendale's municipal parks department. Next, he got a mechanic's 
job at a local Volkswagen dealership. He shared a home with a fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the mid-1980s, his life curdled. His father died. He got fired. His 
romance fell apart. He quit smoking and drugs, but he kept right on drinking. 
He acquired three drunk-driving convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, he rented garage space from McKenna's Auto Parts on Verdugo 
Boulevard in Montrose and opened his own business: Ralph's Automotive, 
specializing in German cars. He visited the convenience store at the Shell 
station next door two or three times a day, buying six-packs as often as 
snacks. 
</P>
<P>
The station employees noted that he was bellicose when drunk, which was often. 
Minorities were starting to show up occasionally in the area, and Tavlian 
apparently was displeased. Once, a black customer dawdled at the register, one 
former employee recalls, and Tavlian muttered about his taking so long. "Get 
back where you came from," he said. When an Asian of any nationality annoyed 
him, he would hiss about "that nip." 
</P>
<P>
But he never confronted anyone face to face. He waited until they were out of 
earshot. 
</P>
<P>
"Sober, he's just normal. Alcohol tends to bring out negative traits," says 
Tavlian's friend, Jim Winstanley, a Glendale parks maintenance worker. "He's 
not a virulent racist. He's a mild racist. He's a racist if he's mad at you." 
</P>
<P>
On July 11, 1989, Ralph Tavlian got mad at Johnny McCool. 
</P>
<P>
McCool and Bond had spent the evening counseling a Y junior high group and were 
headed afterward to a young woman's house. A mild wind fluttered. The air was 
so clear that the distant skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles lit the horizon 
as Bond's car rolled down toward Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
The night did not seem nearly so fine to Tavlian. He'd had a few too many at a 
Mexican restaurant and was reeling toward work, on foot because his driver's 
license was suspended again. He cursed loudly to no one in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Bond's car was low on gas, so he turned in at the Shell on Verdugo Boulevard. 
As he parked by the pump, about 8:45 p.m., Tavlian staggered past. Bond and 
McCool exchanged a glance. Check out that drunk, each one thought, but neither 
said a thing. 
</P>
<P>
Bond went inside the store to pay the cashier while McCool headed for the phone 
to call the friend they planned to visit. 
</P>
<P>
Tavlian, next door at his auto yard, thought he felt something small strike his 
chest from the direction of the gas station. He peered over and saw about eight 
people, among them the black man on the phone. He had his suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Bontjas, the night clerk at the Shell, was watching. No one threw 
anything, he told police later. He saw Tavlian jump over the wall and run to 
the booth, then tear the phone from McCool's hand. He heard Tavlian shouting 
racial slurs over and over again. He saw Tavlian slap McCool. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like a movie," McCool says now, "and it felt like a dream." 
</P>
<P>
Bond rushed to McCool's aid. He recalls that Tavlian asked The Question. "Why 
are you friends with niggers?" he demanded to know. Bond gave his standard 
response. That's when Tavlian tried to knee Bond in the groin. 
</P>
<P>
The two friends held Tavlian to the ground while Bontjas called Glendale 
police. In the presence of Officers Eric Sachs and Darrel McEntarffer, Bond 
made a citizen's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"While in the police car," McEntarffer wrote later in his report, "Suspect 
Tavlian stated, 'I have $30,000 in tools in my shop. I just get nervous when I 
see niggers around.' " 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, Tavlian woke up in his cell at the Glendale City Jail with 
only a faint recollection of the previous 12 hours. At 9 a.m., he was led to a 
tiny room with a plain table and three chairs. Two detectives waited to 
question him. 
</P>
<P>
"In my drunken mind, I singled him out," Tavlian told the detectives. "It was 
strange for a black to be there." Then, backtracking: "I've never had any 
problems with blacks, I have nothing against him. Why I singled him out, I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
He appeared sure of himself, almost cocky. But inside he squirmed. "They were 
calling me a racist," he says. "I'm seeing myself in a white sheet burning a 
cross. It was a degrading feeling." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the half-hour session, says Detective R. O. (Rusty) Hancock, 
"There was no doubt in my mind that the only reason he singled out Mr. McCool 
was because Mr. McCool was black." 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, Tavlian was charged with one misdemeanor count of battery and 
one felony count of interference with the exercise of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Legal maneuvering stalled the outcome until Jan. 26, 1990. On that day, 
then-Glendale Municipal Judge Charles Horan accepted a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights charge was dropped. Tavlian pleaded no contest to the battery 
charge. According to plan, Horan sentenced him to six months in the county 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
"On the garden-variety battery with this level of injury, they wouldn't have 
given jail time. They would say, 'Here's a fine and stay away from him,' " says 
Charles Urtuzuastegui, Tavlian's attorney. "Here the seriousness was not in the 
injury but was in the ramifications of allegations of racially motivated 
remarks." 
</P>
<P>
Tavlian spent 90 days at the county's alcohol rehabilitation center in Acton. 
He was released and later served four months in jail for the battery and an 
earlier drunk-driving charge. 
</P>
<P>
McCool had no idea that the People vs. Ralph Tavlian was wending its way 
through the judicial system. Detective Hancock left a telephone message for him 
early on, but they missed connections. No one called again. 
</P>
<P>
He told few others about the incident. "It's pretty personal on my part," he 
says. Besides, "I wanted to forget about it myself." 
</P>
<P>
But whenever he passed the gas station, even after it changed hands and became 
a Mobil, he remembered. He wasn't deterred from attending the annual 
Oktoberfest in Montrose recently, but he joked, a little nervously, with a 
black friend "about how we would see how many white people got drunk and how 
they act." 
</P>
<P>
He still is best friends with Bond. His girlfriend of 10 months, whom he met at 
the Y, is white. 
</P>
<P>
But he is wary of white strangers now. Outside the familiar surroundings of the 
Y, he wonders how they expect him to talk, whether they think he must be 
stupid, or a thief, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
He wonders, too, what those strangers might do. His first response to a 
telephone call from a reporter about the incident was a sudden, sharp intake of 
breath. "How do I know you're not just someone trying to get me?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ralph Tavlian says his life is in the midst of an overhaul. He is 
back fixing cars at his bay behind McKenna's. He lives in an apartment nearby 
with his mother. He is sober these days. 
</P>
<P>
He remains bitter about his treatment by police and the time he had to serve. 
He believes that he was made a scapegoat. "There's a lot of people who do a lot 
worse than what I did," he says. He still talks about blacks being "nervy" and 
mentions that blacks, not whites, are the ones selling crack on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
But he is also noticing that resentment of his own group has increased in 
direct proportion to the size of the local Armenian community, the 
fastest-growing ethnic population in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
His golf buddies have begun to tease him by saying things like, "I see your 
homeboys have bought another building in downtown Glendale." He shrugs off such 
remarks; these are his friends, after all. 
</P>
<P>
More disturbing was his 15-year-old nephew's report that the kids at school 
call Armenians "Armos" and " 'mos." 
</P>
<P>
He knows now where such talk can lead.

EARTH GETS VISIT FROM ANOTHER 'PLANET'; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: IN REALITY, IT'S JUST THE GALILEO SPACECRAFT SWINGING BY ON ITS WAY TO 
STUDY JUPITER. SCIENTISTS ARE EXCITED BY THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW EARTH AS 
IF FROM AN ALIEN SHIP. 
</P>

<P>
On its convoluted journey to Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft swung by Earth on 
Saturday, giving scientists the first glimpse of what it might be like to be 
aboard an alien spacecraft flying through the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:35 p.m., only four-tenths of a second behind schedule and a mere five 
miles off course, the $1.5-billion nuclear-powered spacecraft flew flawlessly 
less than 600 miles above the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"It was virtually perfect," said William J. O'Neil, Galileo's project manager 
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. "We could have missed by 100 
miles or more . . . and we'd still be on our way to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to communicate the elation one feels with these encounters," said 
Clayne M. Yeates, science and mission design manager at JPL. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's encounter with Earth was like no previous space mission because it 
allowed scientists for the first time to observe the Earth and moon in the same 
way and with the same instruments that are used to study other planets in the 
solar system. Eventually, scientists hope to be able to make observations and 
detailed comparisons among planets never before possible in space science. 
</P>
<P>
Two extremely sharp photographs taken Saturday by Galileo, one of the Earth and 
the other of the moon, gave researchers a hint of the wealth of information 
they can expect when they sift through all the data recorded by the probe 
during the flyby. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever comes of these recorded images, Galileo will surely go down in history 
as "the first time any spacecraft has returned to fly by the Earth after 
visiting another planet," O'Neil said. "It's the first confirmed interplanetary 
visitor to Earth." 
</P>
<P>
It will be a week before the spacecraft completes its photographs and 
atmospheric measurements of the Earth and years before all the analyses are 
complete. Yeates jokingly said that at least one JPL scientist already has 
"observed intelligence on Earth" from the pictures he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
Although clearly giddy with enthusiasm at how well the Earth encounter went, 
scientists at JPL realize that they have many more hurdles to cross before the 
six-year mission to Jupiter can be labeled a success. 
</P>
<P>
The next major step will take place Oct. 29, when Galileo passes by the 
asteroid Gaspra, where it will take pictures and make measurements. A year 
later, on Dec. 8, 1992, it will have its second encounter with Earth, sweeping 
the skies just 200 miles above South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Both swings around the Earth, as well as a rendezvous with Venus last February, 
were designed so the spacecraft can build enough speed to make the long trip to 
Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
In a complicated maneuver known as "gravity assist," the spacecraft makes use 
of the gravity of planets to alter its orbit around the sun and build up speed 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
As Galileo raced by Earth, its speed climbed from 67,240 m.p.h. to 78,860 
m.p.h. in its orbit around the sun. When Galileo scoots by Earth two years from 
now, its velocity will be boosted 8,280 m.p.h. to a fiery 87,190 m.p.h. -- fast 
enough to begin the long voyage to Jupiter, about 480 million miles from the 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
When Galileo arrives at Jupiter late in 1995, it will have journeyed 2.5 
billion miles and begin the first long-term study of the solar system's largest 
planet. As it enters the vicinity of that planet in the summer of that year, 
the spacecraft will drop a probe into Jupiter's stormy atmosphere before going 
into orbit for a 20-month tour. 
</P>
<P>
Galileo was named for the 17th-Century Italian scientist who discovered 
Jupiter's four major moons with one of Earth's first telescopes.

CORRUPTION PROBE TARGETS BROWN, AIDE SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
GRAND JURY: A FLURRY OF FEDERAL SUBPOENAS IS SAID TO INDICATE THAT THE SPEAKER 
IS UNDER INVESTIGATION.

<P>
A series of grand jury subpoenas served in the Capitol late last week has 
convinced aides to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown that the powerful San 
Francisco Democrat is the principal target of a five-year federal political 
corruption probe, his chief spokesman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"As we suspected from the beginning, he (Brown) has been the target of the 
investigation all along," said Michael Reese, Brown's press secretary. "And 
there's nothing to be had. There's no evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the federal probe have long denied that Brown was a 
likely target for prosecution. But in recent weeks, there have been signs that 
the FBI is continuing to look at Brown as part of its expanding corruption 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd be happy to find something," one of these sources told a reporter 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Reese's comments -- and spirited defense of Brown -- came after the latest 
round of subpoenas, which apparently are directed at Brown's activities on 
behalf of one of his private legal clients, a Northern California garbage 
disposal company. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, federal agents served subpoenas to five or more legislative 
committees and to individual lawmakers who introduced bills between 1985 and 
1988 that would have made it easier for garbage companies to overcome local 
opposition to dump sites. The records sought were of bills by Assembly members 
Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley), Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose), and Chris 
Chandler (R-Yuba City), and by former Democratic Assemblyman Elihu Harris, who 
was recently elected mayor of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Wright confirmed that her office was served with a subpoena for the 
records of an unsuccessful bill sponsored by the Deukmejian Administration, 
which would have allowed the state Waste Management Board to override local 
opposition to new dump sites. 
</P>
<P>
On his required annual financial disclosure reports from 1983 through 1988, 
Brown reported representing subsidiaries of Norcal Solid Waste Systems, a 
company that hauls trash from a number of Bay Area cities and operates disposal 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
More than five years ago, Norcal lost a bitter fight over its plan to locate a 
garbage dump near Vallejo that would have taken trash from a number of cities, 
including San Francisco, across the bay. Local citizens, incensed at their 
county supervisors for approving the Norcal site, were able to overturn the 
decision by referendum. 
</P>
<P>
"That ended it," said Assemblyman Thomas M. Hannigan (D-Fairfield), whose 
district includes the proposed dump site. He said he was surprised by a report 
Thursday in the San Francisco Chronicle that the FBI was interviewing San 
Francisco officials earlier this year concerning Brown's role, if any, in the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had a conversation with Willie Brown about the site or about garbage," 
said Hannigan, who is part of the Assembly Democratic leadership and is close 
to Brown politically. "If he did something, I don't know about it." 
</P>
<P>
The company did join other trash haulers and the Deukmejian Administration in a 
largely unsuccessful effort to give greater authority to the state in choosing 
sites for garbage dumps. 
</P>
<P>
Norcal officials and the company's lobbyist, former Democratic Assemblyman John 
T. Knox, would not comment on the federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The serving of federal subpoenas has become such a frequent occurrence in the 
Capitol that one legislative staff member described the latest round as "just 
routine." 
</P>
<P>
They are all part of a political corruption probe that came to light in August, 
1988, when federal agents armed with warrants raided the Capitol at the 
conclusion of an elaborate sting operation, labeled "Brispec," for 
"bribery-special interest." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation already has led to the conviction on political corruption 
charges of two lawmakers, former Democratic state Sens. Joseph B. Montoya and 
Paul B. Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
Almost from the start, Brown said he was the target of the investigation, 
alleging that federal undercover agents had tried to hand one of his aides 
$1,000 in $100 bills to buy tickets for a campaign fund-raiser. Acceptance of 
cash contributions of that size are illegal under California law, and the aide 
refused the contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Federal sources denied at the time that Brown was a target. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1989, the San Francisco Bay Guardian ran a story on Brown's work for 
Norcal and the Solano County garbage dump fight. The article quoted a 1986 San 
Francisco city memo saying that if the city of Vallejo could annex the site, 
state permitting "is almost a certainty, as Willie Brown has promised to push 
(the project) through the state." Brown has refused to comment on the memo. 
</P>
<P>
The story may have prompted the renewed interest in Brown, according to his 
spokesman, Reese, who charged that the FBI and prosecutors "are on a fishing 
expedition and it's likely to yield no more than it has in the past. . . . What 
bothers me it's so clearly politically motivated. Here we are on the eve of a 
new Legislature and a new governor and the FBI kicks it off with this."

JOAN BENNETT, MOVIE, STAGE, TV STAR, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Joan Bennett, whose 50-year career included more than 75 film roles 
ranging from sweet, young blondes to sinister and vampy schemers, has died at 
her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 80. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's daughter, Shelley Wanger, said the actress died of a heart attack 
while having dinner. She was declared dead on arrival at White Plains Hospital 
Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
A star of film, stage and television, her acting career began in 1928 and 
spanned some of Hollywood's most glamorous years. Her film credits include the 
1933 classic "Little Women," in which she played one of the sisters of actress 
Katharine Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
In 1950, she also played a nurturing mother in Vincente Minnelli's comedy, 
"Father of the Bride." Bennett starred opposite Elizabeth Taylor and Spencer 
Tracy in Minnelli's 1951 comedy "Father's Little Dividend." 
</P>
<P>
"I loved working with Spence and Liz," Bennett once told an interviewer. But 
she frequently dismissed her celebrity status and said her family was her 
life's most fulfilling role.

Bennett, who married her first of four husbands at age 16, once said of her 
children: "When they were still little, it was in my movie contract that I had 
to be home from work in time to bathe and feed and put them to bed." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think much of most of the films I made," she said in 1986. "But being 
a movie star was something I liked very much." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett was born to an acting family in Palisades, N.J., as the daughter of 
Richard Bennett, one of the nation's top stage performers during the first 
three decades of the century. Joan Bennett's acting debut was with her father 
in a 1928 Broadway play called "Jarnegan." She was 16. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the play she was signed for films, following her two older sisters 
to Hollywood. Bennett was 18 when she was chosen by representatives of Samuel 
Goldwyn to play her first movie role in "Bulldog Drummond" opposite actor 
Ronald Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
She was later to work on stage with one of her four daughters, Melinda, in the 
play "Susan and God." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's early roles tended to be bland, blonde innocent characters until 
1939, when the script for "Trade Winds" required her to wear a brunette wig. 
After the change in hair color she was soon portraying a new type of character, 
like the Cockney tart in "Man Hunt," an artist's model in "Woman in the Window" 
and a scheming woman in "Scarlet Street." 
</P>
<P>
Her sinister and sometimes vampy characters led one critic to refer to her as a 
"noir priestess." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's marriages and home life were frequently the fodder for Hollywood 
gossip sheets. She never liked such attention and once sent Hollywood columnist 
Hedda Hopper a live, de-scented skunk. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1951, Bennett's third marriage made headlines when her husband, film 
producer Walter Wanger, shot Bennett's Hollywood agent twice in the groin. 
Bennett witnessed the afternoon shooting in a Los Angeles parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Wanger later told police, "I shot him because I thought he was breaking up my 
home." But Bennett said Wanger was distraught over finances and denied any 
romantic relationship with the agent, Jennings Lang. 
</P>
<P>
Wanger, father of two of Bennett's daughters, served a four-month prison 
sentence for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's first husband was John Marion Fox, scion of a wealthy Seattle family. 
They were married when she was 16 and had one child before they divorced three 
years later. In 1932 she married Gene Markey, a writer. They also had one child 
and were divorced in 1937. Wanger and Bennett were married in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
From 1966 to 1971, Bennett starred in the television soap opera, "Dark 
Shadows." She also authored two books, "The Bennett Playbill" and, in the 
1950s, "How to Be Attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's film credits also include "For Heaven's Sake," "Desire in the Dust," 
"Mississippi Gambler," "Moby Dick," "She Wanted a Millionaire," "The Texans, 
"The Man in The Iron Mask," "Girl Trouble," "We're No Angels," "Navy Wife" and 
"House of Dark Shadows." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett appeared on stage in "Stage Door," "Pleasure of His Company," "Fallen 
Angels" and "Butterflies Are Free." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, she acted in the TV movie "Suddenly Love," followed by "A House 
Possessed" in 1980 and "Divorce Wars" in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The actress is survived by her husband, David Wilde, and four daughters, Diana 
Anderson of Los Angeles; Melinda Bena of Chappaqua, N.Y.; Stephanie Guest of 
Manhattan, and Shelley Wanger of New York. 
</P>
<P>
She will be cremated and buried in Old Lyme, Conn. No date has been set, Wilde 
said.

MEXICALI, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old Eduardo Garcia Zamores, one of the legions of youths who make 
their living selling gum and newspapers at the U.S.-Mexico border, had one leg 
in Mexico and another in the United States early Nov. 18 when he was shot in 
the torso by a U.S. Border Patrol agent. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, being curious, had scaled the fence to check out a scuffle in the 
United States, when suddenly he spotted la migra, as the Border Patrol is 
called, and tried to hustle back to Mexico. The agent's bullet struck him as he 
straddled the top of the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"He got out of his car, took out his pistol and shot," Garcia said in a 
hospital interview, his voice weak after surgery. "He just came and fired. He 
didn't say a word." 
</P>
<P>
This is the latest incident in a wave of border-area shootings by law 
enforcement officials that have left five immigrants dead and three injured 
along the California-Mexico frontier in the last year. Thieves, often working 
with Mexican police, have killed at least nine others, and police have linked 
another shooting death to a San Diego resident. 
</P>
<P>
The recent deaths have occurred in the midst of what Mexican authorities and 
U.S. human rights advocates say is growing anti-immigrant sentiment in Southern 
California, a development exemplified by periodic "Light Up the Border" 
demonstrations seeking greater enforcement along the international boundary. 
</P>
<P>
The rising violence, for the first time, has drawn the attention of President 
Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who issued a joint 
denunciation after their recent two-day meeting in Monterrey, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities, asserting that Border Patrol agents are seldom, if ever, 
prosecuted in connection with the shooting of immigrants, have begun to call on 
the U.S. government to end "impunity" for American agents, who are generally 
said to have been acting in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, which has improved relations with the Mexican 
government in pursuit of a free-trade agreement, is beginning to respond. 
</P>
<P>
During the Monterrey meeting, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said he presented 
Mexican officials with an "exhaustive review" of about 60 cases of shooting 
deaths and injuries, sexual assaults and other border violence over the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents Bush and Salinas agreed that officials from both countries will meet 
in February to discuss measures taken to relieve border violence. Subsequently, 
Gene McNary, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 
announced that the Border Patrol will review its training and field tactics "to 
eliminate or dramatically reduce" the incidents of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Most of this surge of violence is concentrated in the San Diego region, which 
is the principle crossing zone for hundreds of thousands of undocumented 
Latinos en route north each year. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas is expected to address the issue of violence during a visit to Baja 
California on Monday and Tuesday. Among the recent cases that have caused the 
rising concern are: 
</P>
<P>
* The shooting death May 18 of 12-year-old Emilio Jimenez Bejines at the 
Tijuana-San Diego border. No one has been charged with the killing, but an 
American citizen who lives in the border area remains a prime suspect. 
</P>
<P>
* The killing May 21 of bricklayer Jose Eleazar Lopez Ballardo, 24, shot by a 
San Diego police officer along an interstate highway. The officer said he fired 
in self-defense at Lopez Ballardo, who was wielding a trowel. Authorities ruled 
that the shooting was justified. 
</P>
<P>
* The shooting Sept. 9 of Victor Mandujano Navarro, 17, by a Border Patrol 
agent at the international boundary. Three witnesses told Mexican authorities 
that the agent pulled the victim from the border fence, pinned him on the 
ground and put the gun muzzle against his chest before pulling the trigger. No 
charges have been brought in that case. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol agents were also blamed for two deaths in December, 1989, and one 
on Nov. 1, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident, a Border Patrol agent last May fired three shots into the 
back of a van filled with more than a dozen illegal immigrants, wounding a 
Mexican teen-ager and a Salvadoran woman. Police say the agent may have been 
attempting to shoot out the vehicle's tires. Investigators say the officer 
faced no deadly threat. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mexican government is concerned about the impunity of the members of the 
Border Patrol (and police)," said Enrique Loaeza, the Mexican consul in San 
Diego, who asserted that agents are not prosecuted for shooting undocumented 
immigrants. "What they qualify as legitimate self-defense allows for a huge 
margin of discretion." 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Border Patrol authorities say that the number of shootings and 
alleged incidents of abuse are minuscule compared to the huge volume of people 
detained by agents. The patrol, an arm of the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, recorded more than 1 million arrests in the last fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're dealing with that much volume, something is going to happen," said 
Gustavo De la Vina, chief patrol agent in San Diego, where nearly 800 agents 
are based. "There have been incidents, but is it total mayhem? I don't think 
so. Is it a racist attitude, a shoot-to-kill attitude? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol, like other police forces, requires that agents resort to 
lethal force only to save their lives or the lives of others. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol officials point out that most of the violence is committed by 
organized bands of Mexican thieves who prey on the migrants crossing frontier 
hills and canyons in the dark of night. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police figures show that such violence continues to rise with an 
upswing in illegal immigration. Two killings and 60 robberies were reported in 
1982. But during the first eight months of this year, nine killings and 228 
robberies were reported, according to police spokesman Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in addition to clashes with U.S. law enforcement officials and gangs of 
thieves, the undocumented aliens face a newer threat in the form of so-called 
"hate crimes" -- attacks from American vigilantes who want to stop Latinos from 
entering the country. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, two San Diego teen-agers -- motivated by their dislike for 
Mexicans -- shot and killed two immigrant field hands along an isolated road in 
November, 1988. Both were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
Exacerbating the general climate of border violence, says Loaeza, the Mexican 
consul, are a series of what he calls anti-Mexican demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every month, scores of Americans stage "Light Up the Border" rallies at 
the international boundary. Behind the slogans "Order on Our Border" and 
"Support the Border Patrol," they shine the headlights of their vehicles toward 
Mexico in a symbolic rebuff of illicit immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Loaeza argues that the Border Patrol should denounce these demonstrations. "I 
am not saying the Border Patrol has backed these rallies, but they are not 
distancing themselves, either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, two Border Patrol agents in San Diego were disciplined for 
using their vehicle's public address system to taunt would-be immigrants at the 
border with racial and sexual slurs. 
</P>
<P>
The busy Tijuana-San Diego border has a history of violence, but the shooting 
of the Garcia youth last month stunned this desert community of Mexicali. 
Residents, angered by what they perceived to be the callousness of the Border 
Patrol, shut down the Mexicali-Calexico border crossing for nine hours Nov. 28 
in protest. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials, meanwhile, have said they may seek the extradition of the 
agent involved. 
</P>
<P>
Calexico Police Chief Leslie Ginn, whose department is investigating the 
shooting, says the unidentified Border Patrol agent maintains that he shot 
Garcia as the youth was poised to throw a rock at him from atop the fence. The 
agent says he ordered the youth to halt before firing. 
</P>
<P>
According to Garcia, he and friends were chatting with some taco vendors on the 
Mexican side of the border about 1 a.m. when he saw a couple of young men 
taunting Border Patrol agents across the fence. He says he saw them hiding 
behind a car on the U.S. side. 
</P>
<P>
"I jumped over the fence. . . . I just wanted to see what was happening on the 
other side," said the slight teen-ager, who has hawked goods at the 
international boundary for the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, like many other youths, said he sometimes crosses the fence as often as 
twice a week to go shopping, buy a hamburger or wash cars in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"When I jumped over the fence, the migra was coming with the headlights out. I 
heard the motor, and then he turned on the lights. . . . I ran back," Garcia 
said, adding that he quickly scaled the 10-foot-high fence. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia denied he had been throwing rocks. The agent, according to Garcia, said 
nothing. He heard only the single shot that knocked him to the ground 
unconscious on the Mexican side. 
</P>
<P>
Two vendors who were at the scene, Ramona Nunez and Bertha Rosales, also denied 
that Garcia had been throwing rocks. Garcia's companion, Ricardo Gutierrez, 
said the agent never shouted for Garcia to halt. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia suffered injuries to his lung, diaphragm, liver and spleen. A lawyer 
representing the family in a $9-million negligence claim against the Border 
Patrol asserts that lasting injuries may prevent the youth from earning a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager has supported his mother and several of his seven siblings on up 
to $18 a day that he earned as a hawker at the border and washing windshields. 
His mother, Gregoria Zamores, said he paid for the family's two-room house. 
</P>
<P>
"What does a mother feel when this happens?" Zamores asked. "It is an act of 
injustice. Anger won't bring back his health. I only want the one who is 
responsible to be punished."

BONN TO PROBE EX-EAST GERMAN PREMIER'S ALLEGED TIES TO POLICE

Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government said Saturday that it was investigating 
whether Lothar de Maiziere -- East Germany's last prime minister and now a 
member of Kohl's Cabinet -- worked for the dreaded secret police, or Stasi. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said the decision to investigate was made 
after a "reference to a document was found on a file card, under the cover name 
'Czerny,' with an address listing" in former East Berlin that is identical to 
De Maiziere's. 
</P>
<P>
The index card was discovered among documents of the Stasi, Vogel said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, the news magazine Der Spiegel said it had uncovered records 
indicating De Maiziere had been an "unofficial worker" for the East German 
secret police using the cover name "Czerny." 
</P>
<P>
Vogel did not comment on the card's authenticity or give further details about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
There is concern that files compiled by the Stasi secret police could contain 
doctored papers that would incriminate innocent people. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel said that "in agreement with De Maiziere," the government would examine 
the Stasi files to try to clear up the matter. De Maiziere issued a statement 
denying he had worked for the Stasi. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere's troubles reflect one of the greatest problems facing united 
Germany: how to deal with former East Germany's Stasi legacy and with scandals 
that could arise during the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
The Stasi files are kept under lock and key in eastern Germany, with public 
access strictly forbidden. They consist of documents compiled by the secret 
police on millions of people during four decades of Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
The files are considered potentially explosive because of the information they 
contain on the private lives of East Germans, and because they probably reveal 
who worked as informers for the police. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, who became East Germany's first and only democratically elected 
prime minister on March 18, pointed out Saturday that East Germany's Parliament 
had examined his background and exonerated him before that nation's dissolution 
and merger with West Germany on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere said he has asked Germany's interior minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, 
to "carry out a comprehensive examination" to show that he is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Der Spiegel said it has uncovered evidence that appears to show that De 
Maiziere began working for the Stasi in 1981. The magazine provided excerpts of 
its report to other news organizations in advance of Monday's publication.

MILITARY HISTORIANS HEAD FOR GULF TO GET IT ALL DOWN

The Virginia National Guard's tiniest reserve unit has been called up for 
Middle East duty, and its three members are packing their tape recorders, 
typewriters, cameras and sketch pads to capture the history of American troops 
in Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
The commander of the 116th Military History Detachment, Maj. Robert K. Wright 
Jr., is a historian at the Army Center of Military History in Washington. His 
entire troop contingent is made up of Ladona Kirkland, 28, a computer graphics 
specialist from Dale City, Va., and John Freund, 22, an art student who works 
in a Springfield, Va., record store. 
</P>
<P>
The 116th and six other Army historical units from across the country were 
activated this week and will leave soon for Saudi Arabia. There, they will 
gather documents, interview soldiers, take photographs and draw sketches of 
life in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll interview people about their daily activities and get as much down on 
tape as possible," said Kirkland, who celebrated Christmas Saturday with her 
husband and 15-month-old baby before departing for Ft. Lee, Va., her last stop 
before the Persian Gulf. "What we want to do is get a feel for life over 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The findings of the historical units will be used to compile the official Army 
history of Operation Desert Shield. Their work will be placed in the National 
Archives for historians and the public, and will be used in course work at war 
colleges and military schools, according to historians at the Military History 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Wright wrote in an essay on the purpose of the units: "We are not there to 
write a book, we are there to make sure the book writers can find what they 
need." He added that American efforts to "gather and preserve battle details" 
date to 1775 and the battle with the British at Lexington. 
</P>
<P>
After World War I, when documentation of the war was being collected, it became 
clear that there were gaps that could have been filled if historians had been 
in the field. Since then, Wright said, each branch of the armed services has 
assigned historians to military operations, collecting bits of history as it 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, Marine historical units dispatched to Panama as part of 
Operation Just Cause returned with 14 crates of material, according to a staff 
member at the Marine Corps Historical Center.

A man who claimed God told him he could drive through cars with his flatbed 
truck collided with 18 vehicles and injured about 12 people Saturday on the 
Nimitz Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A two- to three-mile section of highway was littered with dented vehicles 
before Emmett Wheat, 47, hit the center divider with his truck. 
</P>
<P>
An 8-year-old girl suffered the most serious injuries when she was thrown from 
her mother's van when it was struck. Francesca Camus of Hayward was 
hospitalized in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Other injuries were minor, according to the California Highway Patrol. Wheat, 
owner of Commercial Auto Wreckers in San Leandro, has been booked on suspicion 
of felony hit-run driving and driving under the influence of alcohol, police 
said.

Zulu leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi said Nelson Mandela's African National 
Congress is seeking monopolistic power as the white National Party is giving it 
up. "We do not want any future head of state of South Africa to have the kind 
of power that (Iraq's) Saddam Hussein has over everything that lives and 
breathes in his land," Buthelezi told the inaugural conference of his Inkatha 
Freedom Party. Inkatha supporters and pro-ANC Zulus are in a power struggle 
that has claimed about 4,000 lives.

MIAMI BOYCOTT LEADS TO 'QUIET RIOT'; 
</P>
<P>
PROTEST: BLACK LEADERS SAY THE CITY SNUBBED NELSON MANDELA. THE PEACEFUL REVOLT 
HAS RESULTED IN $5 MILLION IN LOST CONVENTION FUNDS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's being called the "quiet riot." No shots have been fired, no inner-city 
buildings torched, and no arrests have been made. The streets of Miami's 
predominantly black neighborhoods are calm. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for business leaders in this city that has been rocked by three bloody 
civil disturbances in the past 10 years, this disciplined revolt may be the 
most wrenching of all. It has certainly been the toughest to quell. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past four months, at least 13 national organizations have canceled 
plans to hold conventions in Miami in support of a boycott called by black 
leaders to protest officials' refusal to honor anti-apartheid hero Nelson 
Mandela during his visit here last June. Among groups that have scrapped plans 
to meet here are the National Assn. of Black Social Workers and the American 
Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott has cost at least $5 million in lost convention and tourism 
business, Dade County officials say, and the figure could be as high as $14 
million. 
</P>
<P>
But damage to the economy and national image of South Florida is not all the 
boycott has produced. Black leaders also point to a surge in African-American 
pride as a minority population that for 30 years has seemed to lose ground to 
the influx of Latinos, especially from Cuba, begins to appreciate its 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time it was thought that the only way for blacks to get attention 
in Miami was to strike matches," says Marvin Dunn, a sociology professor at 
Florida International University and a black activist. "But now we are seeing 
the potential for political gains. Right now there is a lot less anger and a 
lot more pride, and that speaks to a certain maturing in the black community." 
</P>
<P>
Establishment leaders do not dispute that blacks, who make up about 20% of 
greater Miami's population, have -- by any measure of economic, political or 
social power -- long been depressed. But, they say, gains have been made, 
especially since the devastating 1980 riot in Miami's Liberty City and Overtown 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
Some have been stunned by the boycott's effects. "We are being held hostage," 
says William O. Cullom, president of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, 
"and we don't deserve that. I have congratulated (boycott organizer) H.T. Smith 
for his well-conceived plan. But there is only so long you can rub someone's 
nose in the dirt. He should declare victory . . . before more innocent people 
get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The boycott was proposed by the Black Lawyers Assn., of which Smith is a 
founding member, after what many viewed as a snub of Mandela when he addressed 
a labor convention in Miami Beach last summer. Although Mandela was widely 
honored elsewhere during his 10-day U.S. tour, the mayors of Miami, Miami Beach 
and Hialeah withdrew an official proclamation of welcome after the African 
National Congress leader praised support given him by Cuban President Fidel 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
In predominantly Cuban Miami, where a failure to denounce Castro is often 
considered suspect, saying anything positive about the Cuban leader is 
traitorous. 
</P>
<P>
But in spurning Mandela, the Latino and non-black leadership of Miami touched 
off a backlash of nonviolent protest that has not only proved expensive, but 
has united the black community as never before. On Election Day last month, 
black activists called for a school and work boycott to protest the choice of a 
Cuban-American over a veteran black educator for the vacant Dade County schools 
superintendent's post. Thousands stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
"There is such a sense of pride in our community right now," says the Rev. 
Victor Curry, a supporter of both the school and tourism boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Miami's power brokers became even more concerned after Smith 
previewed a 14-minute "Boycott Miami" video, which includes footage of police 
clubbing Haitian demonstrators and compares the treatment of blacks here to 
their treatment in Selma, Ala., in the 1960s. The tape includes a snippet from 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, and points out that while 
Mandela was denied an official greeting, a key to the county was recently 
awarded to Robocop, a fictitious movie android. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has announced plans to send the video to some 1,000 businesses, 
convention planners and even travel agents. It could also be sent to the 
National Football League, which has already been asked by Smith not to consider 
Miami for the 1993 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Many see the video as extortive. Smith denies that. "That videotape is nothing 
more than a compilation of news stories that have happened here," he says, 
adding that a date for distributing the video has not been made. "It is not 
meant to be a threat." 
</P>
<P>
But the video is viewed as a threat, especially by Cullom and others monitoring 
the boycott's economic effects on tourism, Miami's major industry. Last year 
tourism brought $5.6 billion into Dade County. "In three of four years," says 
Cullom, "the damage this is doing to the community will be in the billions of 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
James K. Batten, chairman of Knight-Ridder Inc., which owns the Miami Herald, 
told a business group last week that the boycott was responsible for "poisonous 
messages about Miami (being) pumped out into the rest of America and the world, 
(which) cannot be retrieved once the boycott is over." 
</P>
<P>
Smith and other black leaders have set several conditions for ending the 
boycott. They are asking for: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increased opportunities for black professionals, especially in tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Immigration reform that would benefit Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A review of police procedures in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
But before any negotiations on those issues can begin, Smith insists that the 
mayors or city commissions of the three cities that snubbed Mandela must 
apologize. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban-born Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez flatly refuses to do that. In recent 
weeks, Suarez has spent hours being interviewed and writing newspaper op-ed 
pieces about the controversy, emphasizing city programs aimed at black economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
But while allowing that he "regrets" the offense taken by many blacks over the 
lack of official welcome of Mandela, Suarez insists that Mandela's "visit to 
Miami Beach did not require, did not request and did not provide for any 
official reception. What, then, is there to apologize about?" 
</P>
<P>
Miami Beach Mayor Alex Daoud has also refused to issue an apology, saying he 
wasn't even invited to meet Mandela. But it is Suarez, a Cuban-American who is 
beholden to a large constituency of staunch anti-Castro voters, who is 
considered key to breaking the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
As popular as the boycott has been among blacks, it has not received unanimous 
support. T. Willard Fair, president of the Urban League of Greater Miami, has 
urged the national organization to go ahead with its convention, beginning here 
Wednesday. But at least 18 chapter presidents have declined to attend, saying 
they will respect the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a 43-year-old trial lawyer, says he is surprised and encouraged by the 
impact of the boycott, which was aimed at tourism not only because it is the 
largest industry here but because "they've been boycotting us for years -- they 
just never called a press conference to tell us." 
</P>
<P>
"We have got the power brokers' attention. I believe they underestimated us," 
he said. "But we were well prepared with a calculated campaign that we thought 
would take four to six months. We are making progress. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not out to destroy the economy," Smith says. "We want to share in the 
economy. We are not vindictive. We would like to see this thing over. But it 
has got to end with dignity. The boycott will end when the apology is made and 
other conditions are met. There will be no surrender."

<P>
Santa Claus made his first delivery in Southern California this weekend. And if 
you don't believe it, just ask 3-year-old Tabetha Thomas and her sister, 
2-year-old Tiffany. 
</P>
<P>
"There he is!" cried Tabetha, perched atop a living room couch, her nose 
pressed against a cold window pane Friday evening. Her eyes scanned the 
star-lit sky where she was convinced she saw the jolly old elf and his reindeer 
pulling away from her grandmother's big yellow house. 
</P>
<P>
Only moments later, she and her sister were on the floor tearing through 
ribbons, wrapping paper and boxes to find play sets featuring Mickey Mouse and 
other Disneyland characters. 
</P>
<P>
Although too young to understand, Tabetha and Tracy have Saddam Hussein to 
thank for Christmas' early arrival this year. Today, their parents, Lance Cpl. 
Tracy Thomas and Cpl. Adrienne Thomas, report to their Los Alamitos Marine 
reserve company for service in Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
The Thomases' unit -- Company D, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Marines -- was notified 
Nov. 30 that it was being tapped for service, and last week the family rushed 
to prepare for an unexpected departure and an early Christmas celebration with 
their children, whom they may not see again for at least six months. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping that we would be called after Christmas," said 25-year-old 
Tracy Thomas while watching Tiffany fumble with her new MickeyTown Fire Truck 
Playset. "But this is it. We wanted someone to be here for them at Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Karen Seward, Tracy's mother, said family members pitched in during the hectic 
week to convert her home into something worthy of a holiday greeting card. 
</P>
<P>
A shapely fir tree stood tall and decorated in the living room; a row of red 
and white stockings hung from the fireplace; garland and ribbon were draped 
along the banisters and the aroma of a holiday meal -- lasagna, Tracy's 
favorite -- wafted from the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing missing, Adrienne said, is that "we usually have time to 
buy more stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Adrienne, the only woman in the 125-member Marine rifle company, said she cried 
after being notified that the company was being mobilized. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been really, really hectic," she said. "I've been trying to spend time 
with my daughters. I've told them (that we will be leaving), but my 3-year-old 
keeps asking, 'Why? Why?' 
</P>
<P>
"Six months is a long time to spend away from my children. I hope they don't 
forget me." 
</P>
<P>
The Thomases' unit will first be sent to Camp Pendleton for an undetermined 
period of training. From there, the company will ship out to Okinawa, where 
Tracy speculated the company would help replace another Marine unit that has 
been called to duty in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The two said they have been keeping close track of the events in the Middle 
East since the start of troop deployments, partly because Tracy's brother, 
Marine Sgt. James W. Thomas Jr., was among the first to be shipped out. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, they have listened to Hussein's announcement on the release of 
all hostages, including those from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still going," Tracy said. "It doesn't change much." 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is Kuwait, not the hostages," Adrienne said. "At least they 
(hostages) will be home with their families." 
</P>
<P>
Until their return, the couple's children will be staying with Seward. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, my mother-in-law will write a lot of letters," Adrienne said. "I 
never thought this would happen." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the young parents say they are happy that they at least will be together 
on active duty, when it is expected that Adrienne will continue her duties 
keeping track of the company's personnel records. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Thomases have the Marine Corps to thank, at least partially, for 
their first meeting while reservists at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"He just walked in one day," she said, recalling the occasion about five years 
ago. "I tell him he's lucky that out of all those guys, I married him."

JUVENILE HALL HELD CAPTIVE BY CROWDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No nighttime reading is allowed for youths forced to sleep in makeshift 
dormitories at the San Fernando Valley Juvenile Hall because guards fear that 
something as innocuous as a book or magazine could conceal a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
With the hall's population 45% over capacity, even the most minor fight has the 
potential for escalating out of control. There are rules for everything, most 
aimed at keeping minors who are incarcerated for offenses ranging from drug 
possession to murder under the tight discipline of guards. 
</P>
<P>
Underwear is the only possession allowed at night for those who bed down in the 
day rooms that serve as dormitories. At night, and at times during the day, 
youths are not allowed to utter a word. Because only five at a time can be in 
the bathrooms, where silence is also enforced, it can take more than an hour 
for all youths to complete their pre-breakfast routines. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not able to provide the kind of secure but relaxed atmosphere that 
would probably be beneficial to the children," said Trula Worthy-Clayton, the 
Sylmar facility's superintendent. "Even teen-agers want a little peace and 
quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, under orders from the California Youth Authority to alleviate the 
crowding, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted to apply for $18 
million in state bond funding to expand the Sylmar hall by 160 beds by 1993 and 
to plan for the replacement and expansion of the aging Central Juvenile Hall in 
Lincoln Heights. 
</P>
<P>
The one-story Sylmar hall, encircled by a red brick wall, was built in 1978. It 
has enough private rooms for 393 youths, but hundreds of others must sleep in 
open day rooms, which are also used for eating and watching television. 
</P>
<P>
For troubled youths, living so close together means violence is a blink away, 
detention officers said. During a visit last week, a reporter and photographer 
saw an altercation -- quickly squelched -- flare up when one boy bumped into 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"This constant face-to-face contact is not ideal, especially in view of the 
gang situation on the outside and the fact that many times these kids despise 
each other," said Donald McGruder, probation director at the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Officers keep watch for any signs of gang identification, such as complicated 
knots in inmates' shoelaces, and they frequently frisk their charges for 
pencils, rocks or pieces of metal that could be used as weapons. Infractions of 
rules can lead in some cases to confinement in an isolation room or longer 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile halls are way stations for youths awaiting court hearings, placement 
in one of the county's 15 juvenile detention camps or in one of the California 
Youth Authority's more prison-like facilities. Most of the hall residents range 
in age from 10 to 17, but some are younger; about 1 in 10 are girls. 
</P>
<P>
Similar crowding at county and state facilities has caused a backlog in the 
system, increasing the average stay at Sylmar from 21 days in 1986 to about 28 
today, administrators said. Several youths last week said they had been in 
Sylmar for seven months. 
</P>
<P>
The youths say their large numbers create such problems as not being allowed to 
take afternoon naps because their beds are locked away and having their 
telephone conversations cut short. 
</P>
<P>
"When there's more people, we get less privileges, that's all," said Manuel, 
16, who had arrived at the hall the night before on the latest of several stays 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a few said they actually prefer being with others in the dormitory 
to the isolation of the private rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem like you're in a jail if you sleep in the day room," said 
Cornelius, 16. "If you sleep in one of them rooms, all alone, it's jail." 
</P>
<P>
The 6 a.m. wake-up call in one of the hall's units touched off frenetic 
activity. The 19 youths sleeping in their own rooms were marched -- five at a 
time, hands behind their backs, eyes straight ahead -- into the bathroom. 
Meanwhile, the 12 who slept on the day room floor stripped their beds, folded 
their mattresses and stored them in closets -- all the while wearing only their 
underpants. 
</P>
<P>
Their clothes are taken away at night to prevent their use in escapes or 
suicide attempts or, in the case of shoes, as weapons. Those assigned to 
bedrooms keep their clothes outside their doors and are allowed to dress in 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The 31 boys who assembled in the quickly transformed day room to wolf down a 
hearty breakfast of pancakes, ham, oatmeal and grapefruit were silent as they 
ate, under orders from the officers. 
</P>
<P>
The youths march to school daily at a campus run by the Los Angeles County 
Office of Education on the hall property. Several times a week there are more 
students than can be taught in classrooms and the excess students are sent to 
exercise in the gym or sometimes to their units without receiving any 
instruction, said Principal Solomon Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
The facility has grown steadily since being rebuilt after it was destroyed in 
the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. Similar growth has occurred at the 117 county and 
state youth facilities around California, especially those located in or near 
larger cities. 
</P>
<P>
About 17,600 youths were incarcerated statewide last year, compared with about 
14,000 in 1984, an increase of 26%, according to youth authority statistics. 
</P>
<P>
State youth authority officials have allowed violations of their own rules 
against letting youths sleep on mattresses on the floor because of the lack of 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, all three county juvenile halls, including Los Padrinos in Downey, 
were cited by the state for failing to meet even the more lenient emergency 
standards and given two months to correct violations ranging from fire hazards 
and overly thin mattresses to insufficient indoor living space, according to 
state inspection reports. 
</P>
<P>
Los Padrinos was the last to meet the requirements, a week after the June 
deadline had passed and after the state had ordered it closed, said Rito Rosa, 
regional administrator for the youth authority.

POLICE SEARCH FOR GIRL TAKEN WHILE WALKING DOWN COVINA STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 11-year-old girl was believed kidnaped Saturday evening by a man who pulled 
her into his truck as she walked with a friend in her Covina neighborhood, 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqline Reyna Fox was abducted at 7:40 p.m. in the 4600 block of Roxburgh 
Avenue, an unincorporated area of Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies were conducting a door-to-door search. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Deputy John Ashley described Fox as blonde and blue-eyed, 4 feet, 11 
inches tall and weighing 80 pounds. She was wearing a purple shirt, white 
shorts, black shoes and white socks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, believed to be in his 40s, was driving a black pickup truck with 
an orange accent stripe. 
</P>
<P>
"The driver pulled up along side Jacqline and pulled her in," Ashley said. 
"Jacqline's friend was running up and down the street crying for help."

PREGNANT WOMAN WOUNDED, 6-MONTH-OLD FETUS KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A pregnant woman was shot in the stomach, killing her 6-month-old fetus, in 
what Los Angeles police termed a drug-related dispute with a 15-year-old 
alleged gang member early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Other victims of weekend violence included a 65-year-old Long Beach man who 
authorities say was the random victim of a drive-by shooting and a 41-year-old 
Cerritos man who was stabbed to death in his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say Nova Hale, 20, was shot in the stomach after an argument with a 
teen-ager in a side yard in the 2700 block of Hauser Boulevard. Hale was rushed 
to a local hospital where she was listed in critical condition, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged assailant, who was not identified by police because of his age, 
fled but was arrested in his South Los Angeles home two hours later and booked 
on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said the youth had accused Hale of stealing cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident, Clarence Long, 65, was killed in a drive-by shooting just 
before 6 p.m. Friday in the 1700 block of Olive Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Long, a retired Navy veteran, was struck in the chest by one of a barrage of 
bullets fired randomly into a street-corner crowd from a maroon-colored car 
with two male occupants, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody in the crowd was involved in a verbal word contest . . . a couple 
hours before," said Long Beach Detective Ron Pavek. "They may have come back 
and said 'I'll show you' . . . and (Long) was just standing on the corner." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Cerritos, a 41-year-old man was found stabbed to death in his 
bedroom Saturday morning by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies responding to 
an emergency call from the man's wife. 
</P>
<P>
Kianfar Barkhordar, a resident of the 13400 block of Aclare Street, suffered 
multiple stab wounds to his upper torso in the 6 a.m. attack and was pronounced 
dead at the scene. A live-in baby-sitter, whose name was withheld by 
authorities, was also stabbed in the upper torso and rushed to a local hospital 
where she was listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier said that Barkhordar's wife, whose first 
name was not released by authorities, called 911 and said in a distraught voice 
that an intruder was inside her home. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Barkhordar and the couple's 6-year-old son were not injured in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time the motive for the murder is unknown and there appears to be 
nothing missing from the residence," Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
In Lynwood, an alleged gang drive-by shooting killed a 22-year-old man standing 
on the sidewalk shortly after midnight Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said Lloyd Polk of Lynwood was hit by gunfire from a passing 
vehicle in the 11100 block of Duncan Avenue. He died 40 minutes later at St. 
Francis Medical Center.

RESEDA WOMAN FOUND BEATEN TO DEATH; POLICE ARREST ROOMMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Los Angeles police arrested a Reseda painting contractor Saturday in the 
beating death of his female roommate after officers were summoned by a frantic 
early morning telephone call for help from a second woman living in the house, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank LaSelle, 46, was being held without bail on suspicion of murder, said 
Officer Glenda Lombardo of the West Valley Station. 
</P>
<P>
LaSelle allegedly used a two-foot table leg to bludgeon Kathleen Masewicz, 51, 
who was found dead about 1:45 a.m. Saturday in her bedroom at the house in the 
18600 block of Covello Street. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrested LaSelle without incident in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
Police went to the residence after the second woman called the 911 emergency 
line and screamed for help. She told police that LaSelle had burst into 
Masewicz's bedroom and was beating the victim, according to Sgt. Dan Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives had not established a motive for the killing or whether there was a 
romantic relationship between LaSelle and Masewicz, who were described as 
roommates, Hoffman said. He said the unidentified second roommate, who was not 
injured, had recently moved in with LaSelle and Masewicz.

ULTIMATUMS ARE USUALLY A STEP TO WAR, BUT NOW PEACE SEEMS CLOSER; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: WESTERN NATIONS TRADITIONALLY USE ULTIMATUMS AS A PRELUDE TO WAR, 
BUT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION NOW SEEMS TO BE AIMING FOR PEACE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Iraq swallowed Kuwait, the Bush Administration persuaded the U.N. 
Security Council to adopt resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion, demanding its 
unconditional withdrawal, calling for economic sanctions and directing the 
prompt return of all hostages. At the same time, responding to Saudi Arabia's 
pleas, it deployed a large number of troops for, as President Bush stated, 
"defense and deterrence." 
</P>
<P>
But then Bush changed course. He doubled the number of the roughly 200,000 
personnel deployed, to add forces trained for offensive operations. 
</P>
<P>
Bush explained that the change was required to scare Saddam Hussein into 
compliance. But he soon discovered he was also scaring the American people. 
Americans increasingly worried that Bush might launch an offensive before fully 
testing the blockade's efficacy, which was already noticeably eroding the Iraqi 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
That concern mounted on Nov. 28, when America arranged for the U.N. Security 
Council to approve a resolution providing that if, by Jan. 15, Iraq had not 
complied with all prior resolutions, the member states might use military 
force. 
</P>
<P>
By now, Americans were not only scared but puzzled. Was the ultimatum prompted 
by the hope that America might induce the Iraqis to respond affirmatively, or 
was it -- as has often been the case -- designed as a ritual prelude to war? 
</P>
<P>
Ultimatums are a decidedly "non-Arab" procedure. The Arab peoples do not like 
irrevocable decisions that may lead to violence. There is an old Middle Eastern 
saying that if an Arab should ever cross the Rubicon, he would pick up the 
Rubicon and take it so that he could cross and recross it, as events evolved. 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast with Arab tradition, Western nations have a long history of 
using the ultimatum as an irrevocable step toward war. Thus, in 1914, Austria 
served an ultimatum on Serbia, and in 1939, France and Britain delivered an 
ultimatum to Germany. Later, in 1956, Britain and France gave Gamal Abdel 
Nasser an ultimatum -- after they had begun their abortive Suez adventure. 
</P>
<P>
But if the future of Bush's ultimatum is murky, it is clear that if the United 
States attacks Iraq, our sons and daughters will bear the brunt of the struggle 
-- and take most of the casualties. With the honorable exceptions of Britain, 
France and Canada, most nations in our jerry-built coalition will cheer while 
Americans fight. 
</P>
<P>
Yet if most of the coalition is counting on Americans to wage a fierce war, the 
American people are by no means eager for the fray. Though some indulge the 
illusion that the United States can use its superior air power to win a quick, 
relatively cheap war, my experience as a director of the U.S. Strategic Bombing 
Survey in 1944-45, and America's experience in the Korean and Vietnam wars, 
taught me air power does not win wars. Nor should any rational American assume 
the Iraqis would meekly permit superior U.S. air power to bomb their 
arms-producing facilities. They would retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, more and more Americans are convinced the United States should not rush 
into war without first testing the efficacy of the current economic blockade -- 
which is already having serious effects. As former Secretary of Defense James 
R. Schlesinger testified before Congress, for example, Iraq's civilian 
production has declined by some 40%, while Iraq's foreign-exchange earnings 
have been almost entirely blocked. 
</P>
<P>
But advocates of immediate war protest that the blockade may not prove its 
effectiveness in less than a year. They argue the United States cannot sustain 
nearly a half-million troops in the desert for that long. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, is no rational basis for immediate action -- merely an 
illustration of the stupidity of U.S. overdeployment. We should not let past 
errors stampede us into rash action. This is the opinion of two distinguished 
former chiefs of staff -- Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., who was chief of Naval 
Operations, and Gen. David C. Jones, former chief of the U.S. Air Forces. It is 
affirmed by two former secretaries of defense, Schlesinger and Robert S. 
McNamara. Gen. H. Norman Schwartzkopf himself in the gulf, who will bear 
command responsibility, has expressed eloquent doubts that a war can be fought 
without massive U.S. casualties. 
</P>
<P>
To placate this growing skepticism, Bush has felt driven to make a formal show 
that he is exhausting the diplomatic option. He is sending Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III to discuss the matter with Hussein and has invited the Iraqi 
foreign minister to come to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Is serious progress likely to come from this? One might instinctively say no, 
but the Administration seems at long last to have decided to return to its 
earlier definition of war aims. Under these, the Iraqis need only release all 
hostages, which they have now vowed to do, withdraw from Kuwait and permit its 
legitimate government to be restored. 
</P>
<P>
Some Administration spokesmen have suggested that all other issues might be 
reserved for settlement after the current crisis has been resolved. These would 
include the abandonment of Iraq's potential nuclear capacity and its current 
capacity for chemical and biological weapons. Baker has reportedly been 
authorized to promise that once the current crisis has been resolved, the 
United States will not use the authority provided by the U.N. Security Council 
to attack Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Bush has provided at least some hope that the crisis can be resolved 
without war. One must expect, of course, that Hussein will seek to allay the 
impression that Iraqi compliance amounted to complete capitulation. He will not 
have an easy time, for he has courted Arab opinion as a hero who stands up to 
imperialist America, Israel's principal friend. Still, in settling with Iran, 
Hussein showed he is capable of withdrawing from a drawn-out conflict without 
losing his iron hold on his own country. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush has been categorical in demanding that Hussein not gain a whisper 
of a concession as a reward for his aggression, it is possible that, in talking 
with Baker, Hussein will propose a modified form of compliance. Perhaps he will 
offer to withdraw from all but the northern area of Kuwait on the excuse -- 
which the Kuwaitis deny -- that Kuwait has been siphoning oil from a field Iraq 
now claims, or try to retain an offshore island to provide Iraq some land area 
on the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Such an offer would present grave problems to the Administration. Many 
Americans would contend that such a minor territorial qualification was not 
worth the life of a single American, while several coalition members would be 
likely to turn their backs on any further assistance to U.S. military action. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the future may hold, whether America launches a war or the blockade 
brings down Hussein, the effect would leave the Middle East even more chaotic 
than before the Iraqi aggression. The destruction of Iraq's military force 
would upset the balance of power in the region -- leaving Syria and Iran 
dominant. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, even while talks are proceeding, Washington might announce that, at the 
conclusion of the crisis, it will ask the Security Council to convene an 
international conference, not only to conclude unfinished business of the 
crisis -- by providing for the abandonment of Iraq's potential nuclear capacity 
and its current capacity for producing chemical and biological weapons -- but 
to deal with all major Middle East problems. 
</P>
<P>
The most pressing is the Palestinians' desire for their own nation. A promise 
that the Palestinian problem will be examined could facilitate a settlement in 
the current test of wills. 
</P>
<P>
Some plausible rationale for a conference will be necessary. But it should not 
be linked to the gulf crisis; rather to the end of the Cold War and the 
approaching end of the century and millennium. Participants would include not 
only Arab states but representatives of arms-producing countries, and its 
substance should be restricted to the Middle East. That is the world's most 
dangerous region, for there are more weapons in the Middle East than the 
totality of those assigned to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the conference should cover not only the securing of peace, but arms 
reduction. It should include a serious discussion of suggestions made both by 
Egypt and Israel for the establishment of the Middle East as a nuclear-free 
zone, and should consider prohibitions against chemical and biological weapons, 
as well as environmental questions. 
</P>
<P>
Great strides in diplomacy have historically been made when statesmen have 
taken advantage of the end of epochs to reorder mind-sets and structural 
prejudices. At the end of the Napoleonic era, the warring nations of Europe met 
at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, to rearrange the furniture of Europe. The 
war-torn Middle East provides a similar opportunity today. The secretary of 
state's visit to Iraq might lay the basis for the larger conference that could 
promise all peoples of the Middle East a brighter future.

BUILDING AN OPPOSITION IN JAPAN'S ONE-PARTY STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Sam Jameson and Shelby Coffey III, Sam Jameson is The Times' Tokyo bureau 
chief. Shelby Coffey III is the editor of The Times. They interviewed Takako 
Doi in a conference reception room.

OISO, JAPAN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The reason I became a politician lies in Hollywood," Takako Doi, the 
charismatic chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, said during a break in a 
two-day meeting of U.S. and Japanese opinion-makers. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a movie. Its title was 'Young Mr. Lincoln.' I didn't go because of the 
title but rather because I am a great fan of Henry Fonda," she said. "I was 
deeply moved. So I wanted to become a lawyer. I entered the law school at 
university and ultimately became a politician." 
</P>
<P>
Her inspiration, she explained, was Lincoln's "defense of a black person. 
Despite the fact that (Lincoln) was subjected to all kinds of accusations, he 
still continued. I was very moved." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Doi, 62, has herself become an inspiration, both to women in Japan and 
to any voter who wants Japan, which has been governed continuously by the 
Liberal Democratic Party and its conservative predecessors since 1948, to 
develop a two-party system. 
</P>
<P>
The first woman to lead a major party in Japan, Doi has resuscitated her fading 
one-time Marxist ideologues into a party that scored major gains in the last 
two national elections after two decades of decline. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say her charisma alone won't be enough to carry the Socialists to 
power. Doi herself remains reserved in predictions of the future. The 
Socialists' first chance to come close to winning an election in the House of 
Representatives, which elects the prime minister, won't come until the second 
election from now, or another six years or so, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Doi has been trying to pull the Socialists into the mainstream of 
Japanese politics by uprooting the last vestiges of the party's old Marxist 
policies. She plays down the party's advocacy of abolishing the U.S.-Japan 
Security Treaty -- indeed, she tries to avoid answering questions about it. She 
also has moved to improve her party's contacts with the United States, which 
once were all but nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
Doi, a constitutional lawyer, is dedicated to upholding Japan's postwar 
constitution that bans the use of force in settling international disputes. But 
she has supported overseas dispatch of non-military personnel to assist U.N. 
peacekeeping activities. 
</P>
<P>
Relaxed and gracious in person, Doi exudes an aura of self-confidence and 
conviction -- even when she is forced by divisions in her party's political 
philosophy to speak with less than full candor. She displays a playful sense of 
humor, occasionally breaking into infectious laughter. Unlike many Japanese 
politicians, the self-proclaimed devotee of pachinko (upright slot machines) 
playing and karaoke (singing to music recorded without words), affects no airs 
of self-importance. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Concerning a possible dispatch of Japanese people for the gulf 
effort, what personnel might help? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: . . . Non-military personnel . . . who would be helpful to civilians . 
. . . The important condition is that (the dispatch) be based on a United 
Nations decision and be carried out at the request of the United Nations. 
Unless this requirement is met, it would be difficult to obtain the consensus 
of our people. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What if the U.S. effort is a failure -- and Saddam Hussein stays in Kuwait? 
Is Japan content to make its own arrangements and live with Hussein in Kuwait? 
</P>
<P>
A: Didn't the first U.N. resolution that was passed after the Aug. 2 invasion 
call for the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait? Saddam Hussein used his military 
forces and invaded another country and occupied it, claiming that that country 
was his own territory . . . a violation of international law (that) flouts 
international opinion . . . . The U.N. resolution makes clear what should be 
done. We (Socialists) support that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you support a continuation of the economic sanctions against Iraq 
indefinitely if Hussein does not leave Kuwait? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The fact that economic sanctions do not quickly produce results raises 
difficulties. One must brace oneself for a passage of time before the effects 
emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Q: So, you see the Americans as too impatient? 
</P>
<P>
A: I'm quite short-tempered myself. But even for as short-tempered a person as 
I, . . . once you start firing . . . and get entwined in warfare, the situation 
will become irretrievable . . . . Whatever happens, that absolutely must be 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You said the United States should be patient. In exchange for American 
patience, is Japan willing to contribute more money for the maintenance of U.S. 
troops in Saudi Arabia? 
</P>
<P>
A: That would pose many problems . . . . The Japanese people strongly feel that 
if war occurs in the gulf, we will cross a bridge of no return . . . . 
</P>
<P>
The United States has decided to add still more troops (but) the more troops 
and the stronger the weapons deployed, the greater the danger grows. 
</P>
<P>
As we see it, a solution should not be sought by force or by military power but 
rather by peaceful means through diplomacy. That is the strong public opinion 
of Japan . . . . Just because the United States has made a request, the people 
find it hard to accept providing assistance for maintenance of American troops 
in the gulf. And if money is to be paid for the maintenance of military forces, 
Japan and the United States should have some kind of formal agreement. We don't 
have such an agreement now. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the people don't understand us providing, first, $1 billion, and 
then $4 billion. There are many Japanese people who believe that (Prime 
Minister Toshiki) Kaifu decided on $1 billion and then added another $3 billion 
just because he received requests from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Any assistance in whatever form to military forces deployed in the gulf by the 
United States should be avoided. In addition, this is a case of America 
applying pressure. 
</P>
<P>
I think Japan-U.S. relations are important. That we feel we have been pressured 
and finally provided the money is a minus to Japan-U.S. relations. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Although you called yourself short-tempered, many women -- around the world 
and in Japan -- regard you as a heroine. Is that a difficult burden at times? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's always a burden. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you cope? How do your try to live up to their high expectations? 
</P>
<P>
A: I am an easy-going person and I don't consciously take notice of their 
expectations. I have made up my mind to do whatever I can . . . . Things that 
can be done, I do forcefully . . . . If there are things which I cannot do, I 
simply say I cannot do it . . . and explain why . . . . But when I have 
promised to do something, I feel I must uphold that promise. 
</P>
<P>
. . . . You have flattered me excessively. But if people were to embrace an 
exaggerated belief that I was a heroine or had power, it would lead to them 
thinking I was almighty and there was nothing I could not do. Superman exists 
in movies but not in real life. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The Socialist Party was on the verge of death when you took over as 
chairwoman. The opposition won the election for the upper house of Parliament 
in July, 1989, but lost the lower house election of February, 1990. However, 
there was one element in both elections: tremendous gains by your party and 
losses by the other opposition parties. To what do you attribute that? 
</P>
<P>
A: There is a difference between a statesman and a politician. This is an era 
in which the people are looking for statesmen . . . . Perhaps, I had a "color" 
or an image that is different from the stereotyped image of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The more the people distrust politics, the more the old color and the old image 
politicians have, the more impossible it becomes to dispel distrust. People 
came to believe they could have no expectations of old-type politicians . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does the plan by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) for 
the upcoming decade say interesting things for you? What would be the "Takako 
Doi Plan" for the next 10 years? 
</P>
<P>
A: MITI's plan . . . was based on the kind of thinking that goes into 
government "white papers," not on real, everyday life. It doesn't strike a true 
note with the people. Recently, I have come to the conclusion that I would like 
to draw up a 10-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
In the Structural Impediments Initiative talks with the United States, Japan 
committed itself to spending 430 trillion yen ($3.3 trillion) on public works. 
That is a 10-year plan . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Public works must not be carried out in the way we have done it in the past . . 
. . At least 70% should be used for social welfare. In the next 10 years, the 
population will grow considerably older. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, when you speak of public works . . . waterworks, sewage, roads . . . 
become the focus. The software side gets pushed aside. It is important we not 
forget human care . . . . 
</P>
<P>
It is said that Japan is strong in economics and weak in welfare. Japan doesn't 
have a consciousness of human rights proportionate to its economic power. That 
criticism hurts. But it is true. 
</P>
<P>
We must raise the level of social welfare throughout the nation . . . . A 
"Basic Social Welfare Law" is absolutely necessary . . . . That should be a 
10-year program. 
</P>
<P>
In the next 10 years, internationally, we must clarify the standards for 
providing official development assistance (economic aid). In a word, our ODA . 
. . lacks any consideration of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
. . . . We (also) fail to carry out follow-up investigations of the use of our 
aid . . . . 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Filipino people came to regard Japanese ODA as having been 
used to sustain the government of (the late President Ferdinand) Marcos . . . . 
We (Socialists) advocated that aid should have been frozen . . . . 
</P>
<P>
In general, I believe that economic aid should not be given to military 
governments, . . . to countries involved in international disputes, to 
countries whose regimes were established through military coups or to countries 
where undemocratic politics are being conducted . . . . A democratic society is 
important. We think economic cooperation must contribute to the people's 
livelihood . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Q: On politics at home, how soon do you think it will be before you become 
prime minister? And what do you think would be the three most critical issues 
you would face? 
</P>
<P>
A: . . . We must win an election for the House of Representatives to obtain a 
majority. It is difficult to foresee the possibility of that happening right 
now . . . . 
</P>
<P>
The three problems? 
</P>
<P>
Land is a very difficult problem, along with housing . . . . Also, fiscal 
problems . . . . We should rectify tax inequities . . . . 
</P>
<P>
The most basic is political reform. With the exposure of corruption as the 
trigger, the issue of "elections that don't cost money" has come to the 
forefront. But it is impossible to conduct an election that doesn't cost money. 
</P>
<P>
What we must do is create an election system in which it is impossible to use 
huge sums of money . . . and that will accurately reflect the sentiments of the 
voters, . . . a system that can be understood and trusted by the people . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Internationally, since we are a member of Asia, I want to press for the 
adoption of specific confidence-building measures . . . including disarmament . 
. . in the Asia-Pacific region . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Q: And vis-a-vis the United States? 
</P>
<P>
A: Until now . . . both sides have focused on only a narrow view of just the 
bilateral relationship itself. In the future, we must make more importance of 
Japan-U.S. relations in the (context of the) world. 
</P>
<P>
We must have more frank exchanges of opinions. We may have points of 
insufficient understanding and misperceptions about the United States. But 
among the views we hear coming from the United States, there are one-sided 
opinions that don't match the conditions that exist. 
</P>
<P>
For example, on the gulf problem, Americans say they understand our 
constititution (which bans the use of force to settle international disputes). 
And they go on and say they would welcome the dispatch of Japanese troops. 
</P>
<P>
You get to the point where you want to ask, . . . "Which is it?" . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Viewed from the United States, Japan's efforts may be insufficient. But viewed 
from Japan, when the United States asks for help, we want to say, "Do you hear 
our voice?" 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you think the government is expressing that voice so that Americans can 
hear it? 
</P>
<P>
A: That is the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Q: If you became prime minister, wouldn't you have trouble dealing with the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty (that the Socialist Party advocates abolishing)? 
</P>
<P>
A: The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty has changed -- because of the change in the 
environment. Until now, the premise has been that the Soviet Union is the 
threat and the issue was how to deal with that threat. That assumption has 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Japan Security treaty itself must not become a threat. Strengthening 
the military aspect of the treaty or dealing with threats on the premise of 
confrontation should be abandoned. Japan-U.S. relations that are not founded 
upon a threat but rather based on cooperation between the two countries should 
be considered. 
</P>
<P>
Military power should not get priority in our relations . . . the focus should 
be on how we can ensure security and peace. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you still believe that a Socialist government must get rid of the treaty? 
</P>
<P>
A: We could not quickly cut off the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty that has been 
maintained by Liberal Democratic Party governments. Change must come within the 
continuity of foreign policy. Mutual agreement is important. We do not intend 
to change it unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You are using the word, "change," not "abolish." 
</P>
<P>
A: If it could be instantaneously abolished, that would be fine. If we tried to 
abolish it suddenly, we could not achieve a consensus between us. Achieving a 
mutual consensus is important. Bringing conditions to that point is vital . . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Some voices in America feel that Japanese companies carry out unfair trade 
practices -- like predatory pricing. Do you think that Japanese business 
practices are guiltless and that Americans are just whining and complaining? 
</P>
<P>
A: . . . . We have no feeling that everything we are doing is perfect. We 
should check and verify complaints . . . . (But) I don't think it is 
constructive at all . . . for both sides to wind up dealing with problems 
emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When do you think Japan will surpass the United States in gross national 
product? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't know. That is difficult to foretell. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You do think it is going to happen? 
</P>
<P>
A: If things go as they have been going (pause). 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago or 10 years ago, no one in Japan thought that the United 
States would become a debtor nation and that Japan would become a creditor 
nation. In the same way, when you ask about (Japan surpassing the United States 
in) GNP, perhaps you can say, "maybe." 
</P>
<P>
. . . . I am a person who experienced the immediate postwar period in Japan -- 
from my late teens into the early 20s, when one is most alert and sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
America was a blindingly dazzling existence in those days. In every home, there 
was a car. All Americans had homes. Roads were all over the country. There were 
uncountable attractions. It was an extraordinarily dazzling sight -- especially 
because, for us, building an economy was a topic for the future then. We did 
not have enough food. If anyone had tried to think of today at that time -- no 
way! 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, when you ask if Japan will surpass the United States in GNP, that's 
a very difficult question.

DAWN OF NEW LIBERAL AGE? IT'S ALL WISHFUL THINKING; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: DESPITE THE HOPEFUL INTERPRETATIONS OF AGING '60S ACTIVISTS, U.S. 
SOCIETY APPEARS HEADED FOR A DECADE OF SELFISHNESS AND SELF-ABSORPTION. 
</P>

Democratic officeholders.

<TEXT>
<P>
Wishful thinking has characterized liberals for over a decade now: Signs are 
constantly materializing that the tide has turned and a new era of liberalism 
is dawning. The 1990 elections are being touted as the latest indicator. I 
respectfully dissent. 
</P>
<P>
It is dubious, to begin with, whether there ever was a halcyon day in which 
everyone was liberal. The supposedly idealistic baby boomers, who came of age 
in the '60s, may not have been so idealistic at all -- it is not as if 
draft-age students didn't have a personal interest in seeing the Vietnam War 
terminated. And while joining the civil-rights movement might have been 
inspiring at the time, when civil rights and integration moved north, young, 
white liberals headed for the suburbs like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the premise that there is some golden liberal age whose return we are 
awaiting is seriously flawed. Nonetheless, it gave many liberals sustenance 
through the long drought of the '70s: Odd-numbered decades, the adage went, 
were conservative, while even-numbered decades were liberal. Well, that didn't 
pan out, so many discovered a new iron-clad rule of U.S. history: Progressive 
decades come every 30 years (Let's see -- 1930, 1960, that means . . . ). It's 
thus tempting to see the 1990 elections as the harbinger of this messianic age. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is that Democrats retained or widened their smashing edge in 
governorships and state legislatures, gaining the upper hand in congressional 
redistricting. But this was true in 1970 -- Richard M. Nixon's first midterm 
test -- as well; and Democrats didn't exactly suffer in the '80s redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
Another supposed sign of the beating conservatives took was that Democrats 
enlarged their congressional majorities. That's true -- but by less than the 
historical average, despite a historically unparalleled freefall in the 
Republican President's ratings -- which also has nothing to do with growing 
liberal sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
The final indicator of the allegedly bad news for conservatives is that such 
troglodytes as Clayton W. Williams Jr. in Texas and John R. Silber in 
Massachusetts were defeated, while liberal darlings Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New 
York and Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey were reelected. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Williams and Silber both went out of their way to shoot themselves 
in the foot, and neither's conqueror -- Anne Richards in Texas, and Republican 
William Weld in Massachusetts -- ran as liberals. In fact, Richards, who really 
is one of the few progressives in Texas, ran away from such an image; while the 
quintessential Texas progressive, Agriculture Commissioner Jim A. Hightower, 
shockingly lost. 
</P>
<P>
As for Cuomo and Bradley, both barely won majorities against non-opponents. 
Then, of course, there's Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, whose race-baiting 
reelection can hardly be viewed as a liberal victory. The news for liberals 
gets worse from there. 
</P>
<P>
Voters strongly rejected environmental appeals in California and New York. 
Overall, pro-abortion-rights candidates nationally failed to profit from that 
issue. In short, the environment and abortion -- two issues most liberal 
pundits thought would be The Issues of the '90s, catapulting us to victory -- 
are not proving successful hot buttons. The Republicans have proved, however, 
that race -- at least, in the guise of quotas, a more polite way to raise the 
issue than the heavy-handed Willie Horton approach -- still works for them. 
</P>
<P>
All these other issues are electoral sideshow, however: Voters want to hear 
what Democrats have to say about the economy and jobs. The reality is that 
doing anything meaningful on that front will require both reducing the deficit 
-- meaning some tax increases, and cuts in popular programs such as Social 
Security and Medicare -- and some investment in the young and the poor, through 
education and job training, so that there is some reason for jobs and money to 
be in America instead of Germany or Japan 
</P>
<P>
That is what America needs. It is what Democrats are inclined to say. And if 
they do, they will lose. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Bradley or Gov. James J. Florio in New Jersey; ask defeated Gov. James J. 
Blanchard in Michigan. Ask George Bush and the majority of congressmen what 
message they've gotten from the election, and the answer will be: No more 
taxes. There is no sign whatsoever that voters will pay for increased spending 
on social programs of any variety to help the economically disadvantaged, and a 
lot of evidence that such efforts are viewed as benefiting blacks at whites' 
expense -- not a particularly popular concept. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, the ridiculous budget debate revealed one amazing and shameful 
area of solid consensus: Don't invest in the young, and don't touch programs 
like Social Security for the old. We have become an elder-oriented society, 
beyond even the long-standing political strength of the senior lobby. The 
preternaturally self-conscious baby-boomer generation has turned out to be 
prohibitively self-absorbed. There will be even more spending on the elderly as 
we go, while racial and generational prejudices combine to provide dramatic 
underinvestment in kids. We would appear to be a society that has given up on 
its future. 
</P>
<P>
This should not be a surprise after a decade of orgiastic private consumption; 
of an elderly President who derided conservation as "running out more slowly," 
and of studies finding increased sexual activity among middle-class teen-agers 
who expected nuclear war to cut short their chances for adult sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Vienna Hapsburgs of 80 years ago, we live for a glorious past and a 
sumptuous, vaguely nostalgic present. Like the Madrid Hapsburgs of 250 years 
earlier, we spent ourselves into near-oblivion on a combination of 
overconsumption and armaments that are now of little use to new 
politico-military realities: We can blow up the world 17 times -- but the 
Soviet empire these missiles are meant to deter is falling apart and we can't 
deploy force flexibly enough to deal effectively with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
What is to be done? We must reduce spending, public and private, relative to 
saving. That will require not only raising taxes but also cutting federal 
outlays -- something the recent budget morass shows Democrats still resisting. 
Of course, who could blame them? Republicans, and the public at large, are 
still resisting the reality that spending cuts must touch the comfortable and 
not just the welfare class -- welfare, after all, accounts for only about 7% of 
the budget, while Social Security and Medicare are not only the largest but the 
fastest-growing items. Most of all, the nation must face the difficult task of 
setting priorities, and choosing priorities that focus on long-term gain -- 
investing in jobs, education, infrastructure and debt payment. 
</P>
<P>
In an age of instant gratification and rapid memory loss, we must discover 
either large numbers of voters who care more about the future than the present 
(and more about the nation's future than their own), or large numbers of 
politicians whose vision has not failed them. Unfortunately, as recent events 
proved, there are few of either.

A WHITE CHRISTMAS, FINE; WHITE CATALOGUES, NO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andy Cowan, Andy Cowan is a second-year law student at USC. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the holidays draw closer this year, the crush of catalogues in my mailbox 
grows ever larger. No need to check the calendar, just weigh the mail. I'm a 
law student with little spare time in the midst of finals, so I appreciate 
these glossy samplers as a quick and convenient way to do my gift shopping. But 
several catalogues left a bad taste in my mouth when I saw their version of a 
white Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Lily-white, to be exact. Many catalogues demonstrated the racial diversity of a 
South African country club or, for that matter, the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors. Most notable were the offerings from Victoria's Secret, a 
well-known purveyor of slinky underthings, and Tweeds, which offers handsome 
clothes in colors such as "oxblood," "mortar," "mongoose" and "thunder." 
</P>
<P>
I received two catalogues from Victoria's Secret last week. The "Christmas Gift 
Treasury" has 66 pages, roughly 150 photographs, and not a single black, Latino 
or Asian woman. Nor do women of color appear in Victoria's even heftier 
"Holiday Collection 1990" catalogue. A slimmer Christmas catalogue from Laura 
Ashley also provided a window into an all-white, even all-blonde, world of 
landed gentry. 
</P>
<P>
The 160-odd photographs in Tweeds "Winter No. 1" were similarly barren of 
racial diversity, though on closer scrutiny I spotted a black woman in the 
"clearance" insert. Tweeds "Winter No. 2" might have been entirely white were 
it not for the "Egypt" section, in which a Eurasian model provides a suitably 
"exotic" flavor and occasional Arab men serve as background. I saw a black 
woman on Page 66, but it turned out that Tweeds was selling the clothes worn by 
the model standing next to her. 
</P>
<P>
These catalogues are aimed at young professionals and students like myself. Who 
else would send away for sanguine-colored weathered pique tees and foret 
fine-wale corduroy jodhpurs? But what disturbs me is that Victoria's Secret, 
Tweeds and others have apparently decided that an image of wealthy white 
society where minorities play a peripheral, subservient or nonexistent role 
will sell clothes to my age group. 
</P>
<P>
In our society, white consumers do control the biggest share of disposable 
income, and therefore are prime targets for merchandisers. But these all-white 
images are harmful because they reinforce attitudes of white exclusivity. 
</P>
<P>
White students may acquire the same mind-set when they attend expensive private 
universities with low and declining minority admissions -- the attitude 
expressed by a USC student wearing a T-shirt boasting, "My maid went to UCLA." 
Similarly, young professionals are sure to note the lack of adequate minority 
representation in high-paying fields such as law or business. 
</P>
<P>
The message is that the exclusive control of wealth and power by whites is the 
natural and desirable state of affairs. Instead of challenging these 
reactionary attitudes, too many catalogues pander to them. 
</P>
<P>
As a white law student from a well-off family, I imagine that I'm just the 
target who Tweeds and Victoria's Secret are hoping to reach. But this holiday 
season I'll place my orders with companies that foster racial diversity in 
their advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The catalogue I recently received from J. Crew displays a fair degree of racial 
diversity -- as they have in the past. Smythe &amp; Co.'s "Holiday Sale" 
catalogue prominently features several black models. Benetton's clothes are a 
little far-out for me, but their exhilarating, high-profile, multiracial 
advertising sends a vibrant message of integration and equality. These 
companies demonstrate that racially diverse fashion advertising is both 
attractive and profitable. 
</P>
<P>
I realize that greater problems face us than mail-order catalogue racism. But 
if the problem is small, the solution is correspondingly simple -- and every 
step against racism is a step worth taking. If mail-order retailers can offer 
garments in colors like "shallot," "driftwood," "elderberry" and "seafoam," 
then there should be room for simple black and brown. It sure seems a waste to 
go through the expense of printing a full-color catalogue with a one-color 
message.

JIMMY CARTER ON GULF AND ENERGY

<TEXT>
<P>
There has never been any doubt in my mind as to President Carter's good 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
He is a pleasure to relate to. 
</P>
<P>
However, when he writes about the need to preserve our wonderful wide open 
spaces and in the same article plugs solar electricity, does he not know that a 
solar America would mean covering an area the size of Alaska with mirrors? 
Furthermore if he consults with any electrical engineer, he will be told that 
the electricity used to build these monstrous machines will never be replaced 
or renewed by these machines! 
</P>
<P>
Solar electricity has many good uses, but never as a major prime energy source.

JIMMY CARTER ON GULF AND ENERGY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding former President Carter's column ("A Tundra Industrial Complex? No!" 
Commentary, Dec. 1) about the possibility of drilling/developing oil in more 
wilderness in northern Alaska, this column could not have been more timely, 
with the prospect of war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
If we were to develop this pristine wilderness, only approximately .2% of U.S. 
demand could come from this field during its 30-year estimated life. 
</P>
<P>
Developing oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is strictly short-term 
greed that will do very little to relieve our dependence on imported oil, but 
will do long-term damage to a spectacular wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Having been fortunate to visit the refuge, I am one of the few who knows 
firsthand the incredible beauty and abundance of wildlife there. How dare the 
Reagan Administration, and now the Bush Administration, attempt to undo the 
greatest environmental legislation in this century, the 1980 Alaska Lands Act, 
which gave protection to wilderness areas in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is the U.S. is going to be dependent on foreign oil for a long time 
unless we develop more efficient mileage automobiles, and are more aggressive 
in developing alternative energy sources. Then we will be less reliant on 
foreign oil and would not have to face the possibility of war over oil!

"Sour grapes" Jimmy Carter thinks our country has the reputation of being the 
world's warmonger. 
</P>
<P>
If we had not maintained a strong military, the Russians would never have come 
to the bargaining table. George Will, noted columnist, said that "the money 
spent to fight the cold war was the best investment we ever made. It bought 
freedom for millions of people." Lest Carter has forgotten, it happened during 
President Reagan's tenure.

PLATFORM: RENT SQUEEZE

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI MURRAY, TONI MURRAY of Los Angeles is legally blind and receives Social 
Security disability assistance. She comments here on a civil-rights lawsuit 
before the California Supreme Court brought by two welfare recipients who claim 
their rent applications were rejected because they receive government 
assistance. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I think some people face discrimination because of their income level. When you 
evaluate a person by (whether) they get government assistance, you are 
stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a proper way of determining reliability. 
</P>
<P>
California needs more reasonable rents. Prices here have become ridiculous. 
Whatever happened to the two-bedroom apartment for $400? What happened to the 
$200 one-bedroom apartment? The cost is beyond the monthly incomes of many 
people. The governent could help by coming up with better programs to 
supplement the income of people in need of housing. To expect people to find 
good housing with the level of assistance provided is unrealistic in a lot of 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Income levels are not the only factor in whether someone gets rental approval 
from a landlord. However, if welfare recipients prove discrimination, I hope it 
makes the guilty more considerate.

THE LAST RACIAL TABOO

<BYLINE>

Angeles bureau.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAST JULY, AFTER Liz Farnsworth became engaged to Richard Cooper, 40, a 
University of San Francisco admissions officer, she called her mother in 
Minnesota. At 35, Liz hadn't worried about getting her parents' approval in 
years, but as she dialed their number, she became more and more nervous. And 
with good reason. Her mother's reaction to the news was something short of 
jubilation. "She was pretty sad," Liz recalls. Her mother told her, point 
blank, that she felt Liz was making a mistake. Liz's father wouldn't even come 
to the phone. 
</P>
<P>
It took the Farnsworths several days to come to terms with the fact that their 
white daughter was going to marry a black man. But after a few parent-daughter 
phone conversations in which the topic of weddings was studiously avoided, 
Liz's mother finally popped the question: What kind of bridal gown was Liz 
planning to wear? 
</P>
<P>
To Liz, it was a sign of acceptance, if not approval. "I think she finally 
realized that it was really going to happen." Liz could continue planning her 
January wedding, with one less weight on her heart. But she still has a 
recurring nightmare that the wedding pictures will show her walking down an 
aisle that is also a line of demarcation: blacks on one side, whites on the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
No one said breaking a social taboo would be easy. Despite the combined efforts 
of the civil-rights movement and the sexual revolution, intimate relationships 
between blacks and whites are still considered unacceptable -- or shocking or 
disgusting -- by many people in this country. In many ways, Liz and Richard's 
trials are just beginning. Fortunately for them, the road they have chosen is 
no longer unmarked or untrod. In the short time since 1967, when "Guess Who's 
Coming to Dinner" hit American movie screens and the U.S. Supreme Court struck 
down laws barring interracial marriage (then on the books in 16 states), 
interracial relationships have increased dramatically in number and visibility. 
In many major American cities, especially on the West Coast, it is not unusual 
to see almost as many interracial couples as intra-racial ones. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Census Bureau, the cumulative number of interracial marriages 
has tripled from 310,000 in 1970 to 956,000 in 1988, accounting for almost 2% 
of marriages in the United States. While Japanese, Chinese and Native Americans 
in the United States marry outside their race at rates of between 40% and 70%, 
nationally only 3.6% of black males marry non-blacks. For black women, the rate 
is still lower, just 1.2%. And the interracial marriage rate for whites is less 
than 1%. These statistics reflect a country where social barriers and 
segregation affect blacks more than any other ethnic or racial group. While 
intercultural relationships of all kinds can bring about the disapproval of 
family, friends and society, black-white couples bear the brunt of this racism. 
</P>
<P>
Still, during the past two decades, black-white marriages have more than 
tripled from 65,000 in 1970 to 218,000 in 1988. They are most common in Western 
states, where 16% of all black men and 4% of black women are married to 
non-blacks, according to a recent study by the UCLA psychology department and 
Afro-American Studies Center. Black interracial marriages accounted for 20% to 
25% of all interracial marriages in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Numbers and percentages aside, black-white relationships are visibly 
increasing, even in the commercial mass media, hardly the vanguard of social 
change. This season, "True Colors," a comedy about a black man who marries a 
white woman and forms an interracial "Brady Bunch," debuted on Fox Television. 
In the second episode of "True Colors," the couple were shown together in bed. 
"That wouldn't have happened 10 years ago," says a Fox producer. On Lifetime 
cable's "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," the title character's boyfriend, 
and the father of her unborn child, is black. And next year, Michelle Pfeiffer 
will star in "Love Field," a movie in which she portrays a woman who falls in 
love with a black man. Hollywood has come a long way since the late 1960s, when 
Petula Clark created a furor by touching Harry Belafonte's arm during a 
television special. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the new images of harmony radiating from our TV sets are not 
always reflected in the real world, where societal approval of biracial 
marriages has not spread nearly as fast as the practice. "It's clear that 
interracial, intercultural marriages are on the rise," says Nancy Brown, a 
co-founder and president of Multiracial Americans of Southern California, a 
3-year old, Los Angeles-based family support group. "It is fairly common, and 
it's here to stay. It's not a fad or a trend." At the same time, she says, 
"Black-white relationships still remain the ultimate taboo." 
</P>
<P>
At a time when racism seems to be gaining strength rather than waning, many 
people are profoundly uncomfortable, even outraged, when blacks and whites 
unite in the ultimate forms of human intimacy -- marriage, sex and having a 
family. And the expression of their outrage often takes chillingly familiar 
forms. The set of "True Colors" is rumored to be under guard because of racist 
death threats. Last October, all hell broke loose when Cable Guide, the monthly 
cable listings magazine that is distributed to about 12 million subscribers 
nationwide, put on its cover a photo of a shirtless Willie Gault, the black Los 
Angeles Raiders wide receiver, clutching a football in one arm and the leg of 
white actress Jamie Lee Curtis in the other. 
</P>
<P>
Editor Jay Gissen was flooded with more than 1,000 hate letters and thousands 
more phone calls from subscribers, most of them white, furious at seeing the 
black man and the white woman in a sexually suggestive pose. "I didn't do this 
cover to be provocative," Gissen says. "I was completely taken by surprise at 
the number of calls and letters, the intensity of the anger and the meanness of 
them." One caller said: "You're going to make my daughter think it's OK to date 
a black man." Another, the mayor of a small town in Massachusetts, threatened 
to cancel his subscription. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should physical contact between a black person and a white person be so 
astounding?" asks Gissen. "If Willie had more clothes on and they were giving 
each other a high five, we wouldn't have gotten so many letters." 
</P>
<P>
THERE IS NO DOUBT that, even as we head into the 21st Century, intimate contact 
between black men and white women is considered especially threatening. Such 
irrational fear reflects remnants of a peculiarly American historical 
stereotype of black men as oversexed, physically threatening beasts bent on 
ravishing white girls and women. At one time, in the South, a black man or boy 
could be lynched for just looking at a white woman. Many were. In Mississippi 
in 1955, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old boy, was shot and dumped in a river for 
whistling at a white woman. Today, for many whites, every black man, from 
Willie Gault to Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode, is a potential Willie Horton, 
the Massachusetts convict who raped a white woman while on a prison furlough 
and became the symbol of liberal criminal-coddling during the 1988 presidential 
campaign. Social myth tells us a black woman who dates a white man is moving 
into a better, safer world, but a white woman who dates a black man is in all 
probability being sexually brutalized.

Pascal Giacomini, a 37-year-old French artist and sculptor, is aware of that 
distinction in his marriage to Haitian Carine Fabius, 34, who runs a 
Haitian-art gallery from their West Hollywood home. 
</P>
<P>
"If a white man gets a black lady, he's considered lucky because it's exotic," 
says Giacomini, who has been married to Fabius for two years. "It's socially 
much more acceptable if the lady is black. People say, 'Wow, what a beautiful 
girl! She's black, but so what.' But the other way, the reaction is, 'What is 
she doing with that black guy?' Nobody feels threatened by the woman. (The 
perception is that) it's the black man who is going to rape the white girl, not 
the black woman who is going to rape the white man." 
</P>
<P>
"During my upbringing in Atlanta, it was not uncommon for a white man to talk 
about his 'Sweet Georgia Brown,' " says Alex J. Norman, 59, a black associate 
professor in the Graduate School of Social Welfare at UCLA, who's been married 
to Margie Norman, 54, a white UCLA dental school administrator and free-lance 
writer, for 15 years. "When I was in graduate school at Atlanta University, 
(black) girls from AU were dating (white) guys from Georgia Tech, but the 
reverse was not allowed." 
</P>
<P>
While Alex was dating Margie, for example, a white man told her that she had 
ruined her chances of ever marrying a white man because she was somehow 
tainted. It was the not the first time Alex had heard such things. The 
stereotype of black men as sexually insatiable and over-endowed is well known. 
During a military tour of duty in Japan in the early 1950s, Alex recalls, white 
American GIs told Japanese women that black men had tails. "That was the way 
white men were 'protecting' Japanese women from us," he says. "It's insecurity 
and fear of competition. It's a protective device, because black men are no 
more sexually powerful than anybody else, although there are some black men who 
like to perpetuate the myth." 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE THE LABYRINTH of lies and misconceptions that surround relationships 
between black men and white women, they are four times more common than those 
between white men and black women. And this difference has created an 
ever-widening rift between black men and black women. Markita Cooper, for 
example, looks forward to her brother Richard's wedding to Liz Farnsworth, but 
she finds herself torn by her loyalty to him, her genuine fondness for his 
fiancee and her own acute feelings of rejection and cultural alienation. 
"Generally, I came to terms with interracial dating a long time ago," says the 
33-year-old San Francisco attorney, who, in fact, dated whites when she was in 
law school. "I decided people should be able to love or like whomever they want 
to. But I've always felt that for black men and white women, there was 
something more political to it, like there was some status to having 
European-looking women. 
</P>
<P>
"The unsettling part is that in my personal, one-to-one relationship with Liz, 
I like her," Cooper says. "There's nothing about her I dislike. But there's 
part of me that wishes my brother could have found someone who looks like me." 
</P>
<P>
Among minorities, black women are the most conservative in their attitudes 
toward interracial marriage, according to a 1989 UCLA survey of marital 
attitudes among Southern Californians. M. Belinda Tucker, acting director of 
the Afro-American Studies Center, and Claudia Mitchell-Kernan, vice chancellor 
and dean of graduate programs, found that when blacks, Asians, Latinos and 
whites were asked, "Would you marry someone of another race?" black women and 
white women were the most likely to answer no. Black men, however, were the 
most likely to answer yes. "The males in general have far more positive 
attitudes and are far more accepting of interracial marriage," says 
Mitchell-Kernan, whose white husband of 22 years, Keith Kernan, is also a 
professor at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are complex. The researchers found that, in general, women are more 
likely to select a mate on the basis of ambition and earning standards; men are 
more likely to choose a mate for her appearance, and black women are found 
wanting because they do not meet the currently universally valued European 
standard of beauty. As the study puts it, "Earnings potential as a standard of 
mate selection is simply more colorblind than is physical attractiveness, 
which, in American society, continues to display a Eurocentric bias." The study 
concluded that marital options have diminished for black women: "If current 
patterns prevail, 30% of the black women born in the 1950s will not marry." 
</P>
<P>
Black women, traditionally the primary caretakers of the family, often see 
interracial marriage as a threat to the race, according to black psychologist 
Gwen Goldsby Grant. They want to marry black men and create economically stable 
black families, Grant says. Some black women who date white men do so, they 
say, because they can't find black men who are economically stable and /or 
willing to marry. 
</P>
<P>
Black-white relationships are a hot and frequent topic among the 850,000 
readers of Essence, a black women's magazine. During the past five years, four 
of the 10 articles that received the greatest reader response concerned 
biracial relationships. "It's the kind of controversial issue on which everyone 
has an opinion they feel strongly about, and everyone wants their opinion 
heard," says editor Stephanie Stokes Oliver. 
</P>
<P>
A letter in the magazine's "Between Us" health column last month addressed the 
common complaint that successful black men are turning their backs on black 
women. "I am one of many pretty, educated and lonely black women," the woman 
wrote. "My last three mates have left me for white women. After all our 
struggles, why do black men still prefer white women?" 
</P>
<P>
Grant, who writes the column, responded: "African-American men who reject black 
women and exclusively prefer white women have been indoctrinated to believe 
that the white woman is the epitome of beauty and sensuality. Black men date 
white women for many other reasons," Grant continued, "some of which are rooted 
in negative stereotypes regarding sisters. Some brothers say they date white 
women because black women are too domineering, sexually inhibited, 
materialistic and lacking in sophistication." 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Lindsey, a 28-year-old Los Angeles marketing representative for a 
car-rental firm, agrees. "It's hard not to generalize, but in conversations 
with black men, they think that black women are hard on them," she says. "It's 
true I expect a lot, but I give a lot in return. The black woman is now raised 
to be more independent and to take the initiative, and that's intimidating. So, 
white women are a little easier." 
</P>
<P>
Practically every black man in America has felt the razor-edged sting of an old 
putdown by black women that goes: "The first thing a black man does when he 
gets a little success is buy a Cadillac. The second thing he does is get a 
white woman to put in it." The stereotype endures: On their latest album, "Fear 
of a Black Planet," Public Enemy sings pointedly about a black "Mr. Successful" 
who "only wants blue eyes and blond hair." "There's a big perception that (for 
black men) the American Dream is not just a house and a car but also 'the 
Man's' woman," Oliver says. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling the pinch of a well-publicized national shortage of educated, 
financially stable single black men, single black women more than ever 
disapprove of black men who date or marry white women. "Black women are saying, 
'I am college educated. I've got a nice job. I want a man to meet me at the 
pass so we can ride off in the sunset. And he's riding off with a blonde,' " 
Grant says. "It's a personal affront even if you don't know the guy." 
</P>
<P>
"I have single black women friends who spend a lot of time on their own," says 
Markita Cooper, "and we are all smart, attractive and bright. Even though, 
intellectually, I don't have a problem with (black men dating whites), I wince 
when I see it because I don't see any black men, or any white men for that 
matter, knocking down my door," she says. "It seems that everybody wants 
somebody other than us. It sounds so stupid, but yes, on some level I feel 
rejected." 
</P>
<P>
WITH SUCH RESENTMENT and hostility emanating from so many sources, it's not 
surprising that a common denominator of interracial relationships is secrecy. 
Sharon Richardson, 35, and her husband, Richard, 29, met at a Pomona aluminum 
treating plant where he now is the plant manager and she was a clerk. She grew 
close to his parents and sister, but fearful of her middle-class, conservative 
family's reaction, they kept their relationship a secret, putting off marriage 
plans and living together, under the guise of just being friends, for four 
years. They finally made it official last year, in a wedding attended only by 
their two best friends, another biracial couple. Once the Richardsons worked up 
the courage to tell Sharon's parents, it was more than a year before the 
couples began visiting each other's homes. Having a black son-in-law "was a 
thing they never thought would happen to them, and they didn't know how to deal 
with it," Sharon says. 
</P>
<P>
Her younger sister, however, still hasn't accepted it. "It probably has a lot 
to do with her daughters," Sharon says. "She doesn't want them thinking that's 
(marrying outside one's race) the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Richardsons say that early in their relationship, its clandestine nature 
brought them closer, uniting them in a "you-and-me-against-the-world" attitude. 
But many interracial couples say that societal censure, whether condemnation 
from family or disapproving stares from strangers, is a constant strain. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the problems tend to come from outside (the relationships)," says 
Nancy Brown of Multiracial Americans of Southern California, whose husband, 
Roosevelt, is black. "They (the relationships) are filled with other people's 
perceptions that these types of relationships are negative and cannot succeed. 
For black people, it can be seen as a betrayal of one's people -- if a person 
of color is dating or marrying someone who is Caucasian, they're doing it to 
raise their status. For whites, the stereotype is that 'she (or he) wasn't good 
enough for anyone in his or her race.' To even consider marrying someone of 
another race makes people wonder what's wrong with you. It's just seen as a 
step down." 
</P>
<P>
Liz Farnsworth and Richard Cooper had to deal with these issues when they told 
her parents of their engagement. Richard's own middle-class upbringing, posh 
prep school education and Harvard College degree helped to ease much of the 
parental anxiety, which was as much about class as race. 
</P>
<P>
Liz's mother fretted over her daughter's leaving the secure (and white) 
surroundings of suburban Minneapolis, where she has spent most of her life, and 
the possibility of her living in a black neighborhood in San Francisco. "He's a 
very nice man," Mary Jean Farnsworth says of her future son-in-law. "But I 
would prefer that he were white, as I'm sure Richard's parents would prefer 
that Liz were black." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Jean's perception of blacks comes from largely negative media reports of 
increasing racial tensions in major cities around the country. "I think it's 
worse now than ever," she says, "and the reason why is some of these characters 
are in gangs. I suppose there are a lot of white ones, too, but I am just 
afraid of gangs." 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, at first you have to get used to the idea," Liz's father, Gaylord, 
says. "I don't think society is any more accepting of interracial marriage, and 
I'm not sure whose fault it is, the whites or the blacks. I guess we just don't 
trust each other, and isn't it a shame after all these years?" 
</P>
<P>
Liz understands her parents' reservations. "Their main concern is: 'Are we 
going to have the strength to put up with all the stuff we are going to have to 
put up with?' " she says. It was also a primary consideration at Richard's 
parents' home in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, where Liz was warmly embraced and the 
marriage heartily blessed. "My feelings are very mixed," says Richard's mother, 
Carolyn, a recently retired school administrator. "I am very fond of Liz. I 
think she has the ability to overcome any of the encounters she may have. But 
my real concern is if she will be able to take as many as may occur." During a 
22-year marriage she describes as "reasonably comfortable and happy," Claudia 
Mitchell-Kernan and her husband, Keith, have heard and experienced most of the 
encounters Richard's mother fears. Claudia still recalls walking with Keith on 
a street in Berkeley in the early 1960s and being stopped by a black Muslim, 
who said: "Sister, do you know who you are with?" 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, on their way from Berkeley to Harvard in 1969, the couple 
was detained in a Chicago department store when security guards thought they 
were behaving suspiciously. The Kernans filed a lawsuit charging harassment and 
false arrest and eventually reached a settlement with the store. Cambridge 
wasn't any better. Within a week of arriving to take up their new teaching 
positions at Harvard, the manager of a women's clothing store in Harvard Square 
refused to allow Claudia to open a charge account after it had been offered by 
a store clerk. Humiliated, Claudia ran out of the store in tears. Keith rushed 
in and got into a shouting match with the manager, who called the police. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the most disturbing incidents, Claudia and Keith agree, have involved 
negative attitudes from young people, especially black students. Recently, a 
group of black students at UCLA printed snide remarks about Claudia's choice of 
mate in the black student newspaper, NOMMO. While attacking the integrity of 
another black faculty member, the student barb concluded: "And we could have 
some things to say about Claudia Mitchell-Kernan. But who knows if she can take 
a joke, since she is married to one?" More angry than hurt, especially by the 
fact that the students signed the comments with the pseudonyms "Sue Me" and 
"Lily White," she decided simply to ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the heckling is impossible to ignore. Shira Maguen, a 17-year-old 
white senior at Westlake School in West Hollywood, was walking down the street 
in Venice with a black friend, and a white man walked up to him and said, "Why 
don't you stick to someone your own color?" Maguen, who has dated blacks and 
Asians, was not entirely surprised. "I was sort of expecting it," she says, 
"because it's like from the time you're young, you're taught that you're going 
to marry someone like you. I would not have a problem marrying somebody of a 
different race, if the person were right. But the adults in my life wouldn't be 
as willing to accept that." 
</P>
<P>
Many disapproving parents and friends of interracial couples claim that they 
only have the pairs' best interests at heart. "It's not that I'm prejudiced," 
they say. "It's just that marriage is hard enough without borrowing trouble." 
That is certainly true, and no one knows it better than the couple. No one 
enters an interracial relationship thinking that it will make life easier. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling has always been that interracial marriage is not for everybody," 
says author Shelby Steele, who is married to a white woman. Steele, an English 
professor at San Jose State University, is the author of "The Content of Our 
Character," a best-selling collection of essays on race in which he argues that 
many blacks use race as an excuse for underachievement. "It's nothing that 
anybody can reasonably advocate or denounce. But you have to have a sense of 
yourself that you are secure in. I've always had an attitude that this is one 
thing I would let go through other people's nervous systems, not mine. But if 
you are the kind of person forever attentive to what other people think about 
you, it's going to be more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
"The looks I get are absolutely incredible," says Alex Norman. "It used to be 
the looks I would get from white men. Now it's looks of hostility from black 
women." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it's more than looks. Recently, when Norman was asked to speak before 
a Los Angeles group of black women at a Martin Luther King Day breakfast next 
January, one member of the group declared: "Oh, no, not Alex Norman. He is 
married to a white woman." The objection was overruled. 
</P>
<P>
The racism is not always so overt. Interracial couples can sometimes feel 
invisible. "We walk into a restaurant, and the hostess looks at me and says, 
'Table for one?' " says a white Pasadena woman who lives with a black man. "As 
if she couldn't conceive of us being a couple." 
</P>
<P>
Reactions from well-meaning liberals can be just as annoying. "My sister thinks 
it's the coolest thing that I'm dating a black man," she adds. "She thinks 
we're special, and seems to think that each and every thing that happens to us 
can only be explained in racial terms, which is pretty insulting." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the obstacles and day-to-day pressures, according to the UCLA 
study, interracial marriages, many of which are second marriages, have a high 
success rate, a testimony perhaps to the amount of thought and commitment it 
takes to form and maintain such a relationship. Perhaps the most difficult 
thing interracial couples face is the fact that people often see them as 
something other than people who love each other. No one wants to be a walking, 
talking political statement, no matter what the response. Interracial couples, 
like any other couples, simply make certain choices because they love each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"I always used to think white guys were the most boring men on the planet, and 
here I am married to one," Carine Fabius says. "I don't know how it happened. I 
met this guy and he treated me nice, and I didn't have to support him. He was 
kind and loving and supportive, and the color of his skin didn't matter. To 
have a whole race of people put pressure on men and women who marry outside 
their race is really screwed. It's not selling out. It's not anything. It's 
just following your heart." 
</P>
<P>
WHEN Richard Walden and Rosanne Katon-Walden were married seven years ago, 
Richard, who is Jewish, wanted to move into a nice black neighborhood, where he 
thought their future children would fare better. But when they went with 
Richard's parents to look at a house in Baldwin Hills, three black men came out 
of a neighboring home, folded their arms across their chests and stood watching 
them with unwelcoming glares that said to Rosanne, "Don't move this white guy 
on our block." 
</P>
<P>
Richard, a 43-year-old civil-rights lawyer with extensive credentials in the 
black community, wanted to stay anyway. He's not a stranger to racism: As a 
child, a cross was burned on the lawn of his family's Culver City home. 
"They'll get used to me," he said. Rosanne, 36, thought not. "I said I didn't 
need this tension." They moved to a multiracial mid-Wilshire neighborhood 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
For many interracial couples, choosing where to live is the most important 
decision they can make. Most tend to gravitate toward integrated middle-class 
neighborhoods, where, presumably, educated, liberal neighbors will be more 
accepting. Many will even relocate to cities known for their live-and-let-live 
attitudes, even if it means moving across the country. According to 
Mitchell-Kernan and Tucker's UCLA study, in cities with high interracial 
marriage rates, such as Seattle, San Francisco, Denver, Minneapolis and Los 
Angeles, most interracial couples are from elsewhere, usually the Northeast and 
North Central regions of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Movement away from home base removes some of the pressure," says 
Mitchell-Kernan. "When you're at your home base, the strength of social control 
is highest, the (influence of) people you grew up with, your family. There's a 
whole range of negative feedback you can get, whereas if you're living in 
California and call your mother in Chicago and say, 'I'm getting married,' all 
she can do is fly out and smile." 
</P>
<P>
Claudia and Keith's own experience fits the pattern of her research. She is 
from Gary, Ind. Her husband is from a small town in northern Wisconsin. They 
met and married while they were graduate students at Berkeley. Except for their 
brief stint teaching at Harvard University, the couple has found California 
academia a comfortable haven during their 26 years together. "My preference is 
that I live on the West Coast, either around Seattle or between San Francisco 
and San Diego," Keith says. 
</P>
<P>
Dwayne and Kirene Walker have found that location makes a world of difference. 
The Walkers, who were married in Denver in 1986 after meeting in Orange County, 
moved to Seattle almost two years ago when Dwayne, a product manager for a 
software company, took a job there. Dwayne, 29, is black and grew up in 
Compton. Kirene, 31, is Latino and was raised in Kansas before moving to Orange 
County. Though they never had any serious race-related problems in Southern 
California, both say they were always aware of people's stares and glares. In 
Seattle, they never give it much thought, especially since interracial couples 
seem more the rule than the exception. In at least two nightclubs they 
frequent, they say, 95% of the black men are usually with non-black women. "I 
feel very comfortable in Seattle," Kirene says. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that money plays a key role in interracial relationships. It 
costs money to have options, to relocate, to pick and choose among 
neighborhoods. "Money can't buy love," Kirene says, "but in an interracial 
relationship, it helps. If we were poor, we would have more of a problem." It 
is not surprising that, statistically, the lower a person's socio-economic 
status, the less likely a person is to marry outside of his race. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, a white student at UCLA came to Keith Kernan for counsel about his 
relationship with another student, who is black. The student said they were 
having trouble with their parents, and seeing that Keith and Claudia appeared 
happy together, he asked Keith's advice. 
</P>
<P>
"My advice was to be prepared for some hassles and some constraints on your 
life style," the professor told the student. "My feeling is if you love 
somebody, to hell with what other people think," he says. "But you have to have 
the resources to be able to avoid the hassles." 
</P>
<P>
For couples like Keith and Claudia, avoiding hassles means being able to choose 
where they live and working in liberal university settings. But even in a 
friendly environment, Dwayne Walker says, he is vaguely uneasy about society's 
discomfort with his marriage. "I don't talk about it," he says, "and no one has 
to say anything. I just feel it. And deep down, it bothers me a lot. Just 
because a black man has fallen in love and married someone outside the race 
doesn't mean he has abandoned the race. You don't stop being black just because 
you marry someone who isn't." 
</P>
<P>
In this society, no one is taught to be prepared for a life in an interracial 
relationship, so no matter how ideal the situation, there are still moments of 
insecurity, confusion and isolation. One of Liz Farnsworth's first race-based 
"encounters" came at a surprise retirement party for Richard's mother at his 
parents' home. When Liz walked into the party, she was completely unprepared 
for the sharp pangs of isolation she instantly felt by being the only white 
person present. "That was very overwhelming to me," she recalls. "I've never 
been in a room where I was the only white person. I hadn't even thought about 
it. No one looked like me, not even my daughter (an Indian baby she adopted 
last year), and that was very shocking. I just wanted to back away out of the 
door." 
</P>
<P>
Her fiancee is accustomed to such situations, having attended predominantly 
white schools. But he expects to have to cope with another kind of isolation. 
"I'm going to give up a certain amount of credibility in the black community, 
and that's going to hurt," Richard says. "I'm not going to be judged for who I 
am, but for who I am with. But if you are in love with someone, then you have 
to do it. The price is in the eyes of the beholder. If you want something bad 
enough, no matter what it is, and in this case the prize is love, then you'll 
pay the price for it." 
</P>
<P>
WHAT ABOUT the children?" is always one of the first questions concerned 
relatives and friends ask. To ensure that people would recognize their daughter 
as a person of color, Rosanne and Richard named her Jamaica Kate, after 
Rosanne's native country and Richard's mother. Still, when Jamaica Walden was 
born 6 years ago, her skin was very light, so light that no one would believe 
she was Rosanne's child. "That isn't your baby, is it?" asked a woman at the 
hospital. There was even some hesitancy at home. "My husband's family was a 
little more ready to have a black baby than my family was to have a white 
baby," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Though Jamaica has grown to look more like her mother, the family has been 
accosted on the street about her racial makeup. When Jamaica was almost 4, a 
man in a grocery store on the Upper West Side of New York called the little 
girl a "half-white bitch." Jamaica turned to her mother and said, "Mommy, 
what's his problem?" 
</P>
<P>
Racial identity is a hurdle many people cannot overcome. "I don't want to marry 
out of my race because I want to have a black child," says Cheryl Lindsey, who 
admits that a former relationship with a white man was one of the most 
comfortable, nonstressful relationships she's had. "The child is very 
important, and (in interracial marriages) they don't know if they are black or 
white. They are really confused." 
</P>
<P>
That confusion may abate if interracial marriages continue to increase. As the 
nation moves closer to a so-called "browning of America" through immigration 
and intermarriage of different races and nationalities, multiracial children 
will be the norm and the sheer number of interracial marriages will in all 
likelihood reduce the prejudice against them. The growth of organizations such 
as the 200-member Multiracial Americans of Southern California, one of 50 such 
support groups for multiracial people nationally, suggests that interracial 
marriage is here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like an equation," says founder Nancy Brown. "Interracial marriage that 
works equals multiracial children at ease with their mixed identity, which 
equals more people in the world who can deal with this diversity." 
</P>
<P>
Pascal Giacomini isn't so optimistic. "I don't see black people's condition 
improving, and the economics are going to get in the middle, between blacks and 
others, and that's going to create a trench between whites and blacks." 
</P>
<P>
Rosanne Katon-Walden, an actress and stand-up comedian, uses humor about her 
multiracial family to bridge the gap. In one of her comedy routines, she gives 
a fictionalized account of how she met her husband: "I met my husband when he 
registered me to vote," she says. "He was part of Temple Beth Israel's Youth 
Volunteer Corps, whose mandate was to penetrate the inner-city ghettos of 
America and give the people political voice, and get laid. This political 
penetration resulted in 350-odd dinner dates, 14 marriages, five brown babies 
and a white Black Muslim named Isadora X." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it will take the audience a few minutes to get going because nobody 
wants to talk about race," she says. "But my act is about the culture clash and 
just how funny it is. I like it because it's dangerous humor. And the one thing 
about dangerous humor is when you get it right, you laugh and you learn."

THE SHOWDOWN at Sixteenmile Creek was shaping up as a modern-day version of the 
shoot-out at the O.K. Corral. On one end of a damaged wood bridge stood a 
Montana rancher, his video camera aimed at 14 outdoorsmen massed on the other 
end. The hunters and fishermen had come to replace the planks the rancher had 
knocked out of the bridge and to tear down the barbed wire he had strung up to 
keep strangers away from his brother's cattle ranch. 
</P>
<P>
And Ronald B. Stevens, leader of the outdoorsmen, was not about to back down. 
"Bill, we're going to remove that fence," Stevens said. "So if you want to call 
the sheriff, you better call him now." With that, Stevens and his companions 
spent an entire summer's day ripping up barbed wire and mending the bridge 
while Bill Brainard, the rancher, shot video footage to show his lawyers later. 
</P>
<P>
At stake was entrance to hunting and fishing areas along Sixteenmile Creek, a 
stream about 45 miles northwest of Bozeman. Finally, though, Brainard's tape 
never saw the light of day. Instead of calling in the law and going to court 
for his brother, who lived in Seattle, he simply allowed the bridge to be 
rebuilt and remain open. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation at Sixteenmile Creek a year ago was resolved peacefully. But 
it is a good example of a conflict being played out all across the United 
States. The battle pits landowners entitled to privacy and control of their own 
property against outdoorsmen entitled to access to public lands. Few Americans 
realize that many of the roads leading through or to their favorite woods, 
beaches and fishing streams cut across someone's land. Twenty years ago, it 
didn't matter much. Farmers and ranchers, especially in the West, traditionally 
allowed unrestricted access through their property. 
</P>
<P>
But the Western ethic is changing rapidly as use of the wide-open spaces 
increases. More people, particularly urban dwellers, want to make a home away 
from home on the range, and more landowners want them to go back where they 
came from. As the conflict has intensified, others have been drawn into the 
fray: public officials from the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Bureau of Land 
Management, environmentalists who see threats to wildlife and public resources, 
and so-called outfitters, who depend on out-of-the-way, well-stocked game 
preserves to make a living as wilderness guides. 
</P>
<P>
The private-versus-public issue has cropped up in Colorado, where an Aspen 
landowner and local groups have fought for more than two years over passage to 
Hunter Creek, a popular picnic area. Three years ago in Idaho, 
singer-songwriter Carole King provoked a furor by winning the right to close a 
road, leading to the Salmon River, on her ranch in the Sawtooth Mountains. Last 
year in Wyoming, a band of residents marched to the top of Elk Mountain to 
protest a rancher's plan to build a private "safari" resort around the peak, 
which is U.S. Forest Service land. Farther west, the public's right to walk to 
river banks and beaches has triggered dissension along the American River near 
Sacramento and along the coastline in Oxnard Shores. The state established the 
coastal commission in 1976 to handle multiplying conflicts over access to 
California's more than 1,000 miles of beach. 
</P>
<P>
But nowhere is the controversy over access to public lands more heated than in 
southwest Montana, a breathtaking panorama of snow-dusted mountains intersected 
by gorgeous valleys through which some of the finest fishing streams on the 
continent flow. It is here that large parcels of ranchland have been bought in 
the past few years by the rich and famous, including movie stars Dennis Quaid 
and Brooke Shields and media heavyweights Tom Brokaw and Ted Turner (who bought 
a 128,000-acre Montana ranch in 1989). 
</P>
<P>
The controversy "verges on open warfare," according to a recent study by the 
National Wildlife Federation. Who are the combatants? On one side are the 
people for whom government property is one enormous playground. Hunters, 
fishermen, backpackers and bird-watchers flock to the open spaces in a quest 
for trophy elk, fat rainbow trout or simply a bit of solitude. Many of these 
outdoorsmen arrive on foot and don't want roads to their favorite places built. 
Yet each season, they are disturbed to find new fences smeared with orange 
paint -- the Montana no-trespassing symbol -- which prevent them from reaching 
thousands of acres they have visited in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Like outdoorsmen, motorized sportsmen -- snowmobilers, dirt bikers and 
4-wheel-drive enthusiasts -- are eager to head for the hills, if only for a day 
or a weekend. Once there, however, they sometimes build fires where they 
shouldn't; leave gates ajar, allowing livestock to wander off, and shoot rifles 
indiscriminately. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, such carelessness angers the quieter outdoorsmen and rural 
residents as well. Longtime Montanans who once welcomed traditional 
field-and-stream types and wealthy out-of-staters who have moved to the area in 
the last 20 years are alarmed by the reckless hordes encroaching on their 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Hordes" can mean five or 50 trucks of hunters on a November weekend. That may 
not sound like much to a veteran of the Hollywood Freeway, but by the standards 
of a state like Montana -- fourth-largest in size and 44th in population, it's 
an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
This "not-in-my-back-yard" attitude, in turn, inflames people such as Ron 
Stevens and Lewis E. (Gene) Hawkes, president and executive director, 
respectively, of Public Land Access Assn., a Montana coalition dedicated to 
upholding the right of all citizens to gain access to federal and state land. 
Many of these people, who were raised on small ranches or in small Western 
towns and cities, are infuriated that a few "haves" can seal off public rights 
of way through their property. Said one Montanan: "The big shots lock things up 
tighter than a drum." 
</P>
<P>
RON STEVENS, a 53-year-old native Montanan, strapped a six-shooter on his hip 
just in case we met unfriendly animals as we hiked up a trail from Ennis Lake. 
Smiling, he quoted a favorite passage from John Steinbeck: "Montana is what 
little boys think of when they hear Texans talk about Texas." 
</P>
<P>
It was a warm summer morning, and he and Gene Hawkes were about to show me how 
one landowner tried to block the public's entrance to a chunk of Montana that 
they believe everyone should be able to enjoy. Along a trail between a rocky 
ridge and granite-faced mountains, we paused to take in the view. "See this?" 
Hawkes said, sweeping his arm at the landscape. "This is your ranch." 
</P>
<P>
"All Montanans are ranchers," Stevens chimed in. "Their ranch is the Big Sky 
ranch, and it includes 8.1 million acres of BLM land, 10.2 million acres of 
National Forest and 5.2 million acres of state school-trust land. Our brand is 
the Flying R, which stands for freedom to recreate." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens is an avid hunter and backpacker who waited years to return to the 
pleasures of "the last best place," as Montanans like to call their state. A 
career Army officer, he retired as a colonel in 1987 and moved to Bozeman 
because maps showed vast stretches of public land surrounding the city. "I 
didn't want to have to keep asking ranchers for permission to go on their 
land," Stevens explained as a red tail hawk circled over our heads. But soon 
after settling in, he discovered that much of that public land had been 
practically sealed off. 
</P>
<P>
Ranchers had put gates across trails that were, in his opinion, the only 
accessible routes into the Gallatin and Madison river valleys and the mountains 
that soared above them. When he learned that Hawkes, a retired Forest Service 
supervisor, had formed a citizens group in 1985 to fight such closures, Stevens 
immediately signed on. 
</P>
<P>
The skirmish that put Public Land Access on the map involved the Windy Water 
Ranch. Tucked away in a corner of southwest Montana near Yellowstone National 
Park, Windy Water is a 2,390-acre tract of rolling alpine meadow surrounded by 
the Rockies, dotted with sage and matted with stands of conifers. It borders on 
a national forest, including a pristine, splendidly isolated elk ground called 
Cowboys Heaven. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch was bought in 1986 by millionaire Robert M. Lee, owner of Hunting 
World, an exclusive sporting goods store in New York City. Hoping to provide a 
"protected habitat" for game animals, Lee later decided to close a portion of 
what locals knew as the Old Indian Trail where it passed through his land. 
"Hunting pressure" from outfitters "has been so heavy in recent years," he 
explained in a letter to the Forest Service in 1987, that mature bull elk were 
seldom seen in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the original route of the Bannack Indians had been changed by a 
previous owner, the Old Indian Trail was the route many hunters took to reach 
two prime elk regions, including Cowboys Heaven. 
</P>
<P>
At 63, Hawkes is a feisty Idaho native whom opponents regard as a hothead. He 
organized Public Land Access to give voice not only to hunters and fishermen 
but also to "motorcyclists, 4-by-4s, snowmobilers, backcountry horsemen, all of 
'em." Once he heard about the planned closing of the Old Indian Trail, he wrote 
Lee and warned that if Public Land Access didn't hear from him within 10 days, 
the group would sue. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hawkes, Lee "didn't try to negotiate. He just put up 'No 
Trespassing' signs. It was the arrogance of a big out-of-state landowner who 
came and said the hell with local people that got him in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Public Land Access sued Lee on the grounds that the trail was a prescriptive 
right of way -- that is, a historically used route -- and thus public. In a 
landmark decision in 1988, the first in which a state court declared a trail 
public by prescription, a Madison County District Court judge ruled in favor of 
Public Land Access. (Although Lee did not return "If it's too easy to hunt, 
pretty soon there won't be anything left to hunt." 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service officials, sportsmen's groups and the Public Land Access counter 
that some outfitters, in order to stifle competition from non-guided local 
hunters and to ensure a high quality elk herd for their clients, are 
encouraging ranchers to lease private land for exclusive use by fee hunters and 
to close roads through their property to the forest beyond. 
</P>
<P>
The effect is what Rich Day, a spokesman for the Montana Wildlife Federation, 
calls "the privatization of wildlife." Large spreads are turning into "game 
ranches" that isolate public land for exclusive use by affluent visitors. 
</P>
<P>
PART OF THE PROBLEM in the West can be traced to the days of Abraham Lincoln, 
when the government divided much of the Rocky Mountain region into a 
checkerboard pattern. To encourage the building of rail lines, the government 
gave railroad companies every other square mile of land. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, squares of the checkerboard were consolidated into larger 
blocks of private and public land. Much private land passed into the hands of 
ranchers or timber companies owned by railroads, such as Plum Creek Timber, a 
subsidiary of Burlington Northern Railroad. By closing a road leading to 
government land, ranchers and timber companies can block access to not only 
land in an adjacent square but also territory miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gibson, supervisor of the Gallatin National Forest, fears that access 
problems will only grow worse in the future, especially as more large private 
tracts of land are subdivided into retreats for wealthy part-time Montanans. 
Right now, he says, there are numerous places along the boundaries of the 
1.7-million-acre forest where access is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Forest Service published a management plan identifying 48 
additional access points deemed necessary in Gallatin alone. But it was soon 
attacked by a raft of conservation organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone agrees that in cases where public land is landlocked and private 
landowners block access, the Forest Service should do something," said Michael 
Scott of the Wilderness Society in Bozeman. "Where the consensus breaks down is 
(deciding) what constitutes reasonable access." Unlike Public Land Access, the 
Wilderness Society generally prefers hiking and horse trails to roads. 
</P>
<P>
"The charm of Cowboys Heaven is its isolation," Scott said. "The wildlife is 
better. There are fewer people. If you put roads everywhere, you (put) stress 
(on) wildlife and cut trees." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not pushing high-standard roads," Gibson countered, adding that the 
agency simply wants to offer the public reasonable ways to use the land. To 
that end, the Forest Service has negotiated several land exchanges. These are 
complex arrangements that can require having a nonprofit group to buy private 
land to donate to the public, and the government favors such transactions 
because they leave all sides happy. 
</P>
<P>
In Paradise Valley, the lush land bordering the Yellowstone River from 
Livingston, Mont., to the edge of Yellowstone National Park, Gallatin National 
Forest officials have played a part in several successful land exchanges, one 
involving two Hollywood celebrities and another involving the controversial 
Church Universal and Triumphant. 
</P>
<P>
One fight began over land owned by actor Warren Oates and "The Wild Bunch" 
director Sam Peckinpah. Along with friends such as writer Tom McGuane and actor 
Peter Fonda, the two men were among the literature and film crowd that gave 
Paradise Valley a reputation as a trendy enclave. 
</P>
<P>
According to Joseph Swindelhurst, their Livingston lawyer, Oates bought 
property from McGuane in the 1970s and then sold half to Peckinpah. The parcel 
included a road along Sixmile Creek, the principal entrance to a portion of the 
rugged Absaroka Beartooth Wilderness. At first, it was open to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1975, Oates and a local sportsmen's group quarreled bitterly because 
the actor had begun to close the route occasionally. In the ultimate standoff, 
the sportsmen drove a bulldozer up the road. Swindelhurst recalled that "Oates 
went berserk," sued the county to get the road declared private and won. After 
the Montana Supreme Court upheld the decision in 1978, Oates locked a gate 
across the road for good. 
</P>
<P>
Following the deaths of Oates in 1982 and Peckinpah in 1984, their children 
decided to sell the land. Seeing an opportunity to regain access to the 
Absaroka Beartooth Wilderness, the Forest Service stepped in. So did the Trust 
for Public Land, one of the nation's largest land conservancies, which buys and 
donates to the public land important for recreation and open-space uses. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Trust for Public Land acquired about 500 acres of the 
Oates-Peckinpah property for the Forest Service in exchange for four scattered 
parcels of public land elsewhere. The deal opened up 25,000 acres that had been 
shut off for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Another nonprofit group, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, has obtained land 
in Paradise Valley to make sure that large portions of the Gallatin National 
Forest and the Yellowstone ecosystem remain undeveloped and open to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation intervened as land broker to solve a conflict 
between the public and the Church Universal and Triumphant. The cult, formerly 
based in Calabasas, Calif., and led by Elizabeth Clare Prophet (known to her 
followers as Guru Ma), became the largest landowner in Park County in the 1980s 
when it bought Malcolm Forbes' 12,000-acre spread, and three other parcels 
bordering Yellowstone Park that totaled about 18,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The church caused consternation in Montana by fencing off its land and building 
bomb shelters on it. (At one time, Guru Ma predicted the Armageddon in the 
spring of 1990, then backed off when it didn't occur.) The conflict with local 
people escalated spring when three of the church's 20,000-gallon 
underground-oil storage tanks sprang leaks. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the Forest Service considered bringing condemnation 
proceedings against the church to regain access to parkland through its 
property. Rather than pursue the long, costly hearings to condemn the land, 
though, the federal agency, the state and the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation 
bought 3,400 acres of church land last year donated it to the federal agency. 
The Forest Service then set aside the property as an elk habitat. 
</P>
<P>
SUCH LAND EXCHANGES are "win-win" deals, according to Mike Williams, head of 
recreation and land in the Gallatin National Forest. Many conservationists 
agree that donations of land to organizations such as the Nature Conservancy or 
the Trust for Public Land is the most equitable solution to the problems of 
access throughout the West. Environmental groups are pleased because these 
arrangements typically prevent large chunks of undeveloped land from being 
subdivided by future owners. The Forest Service also benefits because it avoids 
confrontations or condemnation proceedings. Owners are happy because they 
either are paid for their land or receive a tax break for donating it. 
</P>
<P>
"In 18 years, we have acquired over $500 million worth of real estate in 37 
states," said Craig Lee of the Trust for Public Land's Seattle office, which 
handled the Sixmile exchange. 
</P>
<P>
But it is important to note that the Trust for Public Land and other 
conservancy groups usually deal only with willing sellers. So although land 
exchanges have decided several cases, they by no means can be expected to work 
in every instance. And however Montana and other Western states handle their 
access problems, the disputes are bound to proliferate. 
</P>
<P>
After a yearlong study, the Keystone Center in Colorado, a nonprofit 
organization devoted to resolving difficult public policy conflicts, stated 
flatly that the access issue was at a critical stage. In the 1988 study, 
Keystone also called for a national task force on access. So far, that call has 
gone unheeded. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the problem is not only "a question of signs and fences, maps 
and enforcement personnel," noted Derrick Crandall of the American Recreation 
Coalition, a nonprofit federation of private recreation interests. Americans, 
Crandall declared, must also learn to "treat their back yards with love and 
respect -- as those who live with nature in the West have historically."

THE GUY FROM CHICAGO ARRIVES; 
</P>
<P>
JOE MANTEGNA IS HAVING A HOLLYWOOD DREAM SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILARY DE VRIES, Hilary de Vries is a Boston-based free-lance writer 
specializing in the arts. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HE IS, IN THE simplest terms, not a New Yorker. Reared in the shadow of Al 
Capone and schooled in Chicago-style realism, Joseph Anthony Mantegna is a 
counterpoint to the American tradition of celluloid heavies. Among the Brandos, 
Pacinos and De Niros, Mantegna is an actor's alternative to that brawling, 
Lower East Side Italian tough guy: a Pinteresque con man with a sharkskin suit 
and the soul of an ice pick. 
</P>
<P>
He has located himself on the American cinematic consciousness with a series of 
small, sharply etched supporting roles in big silly movies -- "Three Amigos!," 
"The Money Pit," "Suspect," "Compromising Positions" and "Weeds." But Mantegna 
has achieved his greatest distinction as an actor by playing alter ego to 
playwright and fellow Chicagoan David Mamet. In the dozen years that he has 
performed in the Pulitzer Prize-winner's dramas, Mantegna has become "The Guy" 
-- the embodiment of Mamet's nasty-boy urban brotherhood whose Janus-faced 
ethos of deceit and loyalty is pounded out in scatological, syncopated riffs. 
Together, Mamet and Mantegna have created some of the most dazzling and 
despicable American male characters of the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he is playing Ricky Roma, the cold-blooded real estate salesman of 
"Glengarry Glen Ross" -- for which he won a 1984 Tony Award -- or Bobby Gould, 
the perfidious Hollywood boss in the 1988 Broadway hit "Speed-the-Plow," or 
Mike Mancuso, the manipulative con artist in the film "House of Games," or even 
the bungling Mafia hit man in Mamet's comedy "Things Change," Mantegna is the 
new American huckster. It is a characterization more complex than the 
lead-with-the-fists psychopaths favored by director Martin Scorsese, one that 
has less to do with the spray of a tommy gun than the hurling of epithets with 
the reverence of Hail Marys. Mantegna has "a post-De Niro, post-Pacino acting 
style that strikes that balance between cynicism and idealism," says Jack 
Kroll, chief theater and movie critic of Newsweek. "Mantegna plays guys who've 
wised up enough to know it's all crap, but who can't leave it there." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is poised to take his post-modernist persona into a larger arena. He 
may not yet be a full-fledged star in Hollywood, but Mantegna is having the 
biggest year in his career. After jerking Hollywood's chain two years ago with 
his cutting performance in "Speed-the-Plow" -- a role that was said to be based 
on former Paramount president Ned Tanen -- Mantegna swiftly landed major roles 
in four films. This month, the actor opens in two of the most anticipated 
releases of the year -- "Godfather III," Francis Ford Coppola's $50-million 
Mafia sequel, and "Alice," Woody Allen's new comedy. Both films are expected to 
increase not only Mantegna's visibility and asking price but also his reach as 
an actor. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the two roles are a leap ahead for Mantegna, whose broad Chicago accent 
and patently ethnic look, just this side of handsome, have so far denied him 
real leading-man status. In "Alice," which also stars Mia Farrow and William 
Hurt, Mantegna plays a jazz musician and gives a rare good-guy performance as 
well as playing his first romantic role. In Coppola's saga, Mantegna takes his 
silkily minimalist malevolence up against Pacino's in one of the film's more 
pivotal roles, Joey Zasa, the powerful rival to the Pacino-led Corleone family. 
Already some critics are suggesting that "Godfather III" may make stars out of 
Mantegna and Andy Garcia the way the original "Godfather" films did for Pacino, 
James Caan and Robert Duvall. 
</P>
<P>
It is exposure that has been long in coming for the low-key but intense 
43-year-old whose first professional theater successes occurred more than two 
decades ago. The younger son of a widow who could only afford to send him to 
Morton Junior College, Mantegna grew up in Cicero, Ill. -- a tough, blue-collar 
suburb whose infamous favorite son remains Al Capone. Mantegna's professional 
acting career began when he landed roles in the Chicago production of "Hair" 
and the lead in a Ragu spaghetti sauce advertising campaign. When he moved to 
Los Angeles in 1978, jobs for an ethnic character actor with few screen credits 
were so few and far between that he supported himself by running a small 
photography business -- taking head shots of other actors. 
</P>
<P>
Since "Glengarry Glen Ross," and especially since "Speed-the-Plow," Mantegna 
has worked almost nonstop. Says Fred Roos, co-producer of "Godfather III," "I 
saw Joe in 'Glengarry' and was just knocked out by him. We had been looking to 
cast him for a long time." Roos is not alone in his assessment. Next year 
Mantegna can be seen with John Malkovich, another Chicago actor, in "Queens 
Logic," a "Big Chill"-type comedy. Later in the year will come "Wait Until 
Spring, Bandini," from the John Fante novel, with Faye Dunaway. He has just 
finished shooting his third Mamet movie, "Homicide," a police thriller that 
will be released sometime next year. And always there will be more Mamet plays 
to headline. "Joe Mantegna is already one of our best actors," says Roos. "Will 
he have the kind of career that Hackman and Duvall have? Yes, he will have 
that." 
</P>
<P>
WHAT AM I DOING? What am I doing now, at this moment?" Mantegna asks with 
staccato, unmistakably Mamet-like rhythms. "At this moment, what I am doing is 
packing boxes in my garage." 
</P>
<P>
It is an early autumn day and the San Gabriel Mountains, just north of 
Mantegna's Toluca Lake home, are remarkably free of smog. It is a pleasant 
afternoon for the actor to pursue one of his longstanding rituals: bundling his 
family belongings into cardboard boxes for another out-of-town job, this time 
the three-month location shoot in Baltimore for "Homicide." "Well, I do it," he 
says, carefully writing his name and address on a box cover. "I just do. That's 
part of the deal, that we all go together."

It is a typical Mantegna comment, straightforward, unadorned. It is delivered 
in his unpretentious Chicago accent, backed up by a steady, assessing gaze. 
There is no smile -- not yet -- and in person he is taller, leaner and more 
handsome than his compact, jowly screen image. He is also utterly unlike the 
con artists and killers he usually portrays. Contentedly packing up his 
family's goods, Mantegna seems trustworthy, this father of two who has been 
married to the same woman, Arlene, for more than 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Mamet's theory, that we travel in a club," says Mantegna, leading his 
visitor from the garage into his tidy, three-bedroom ranch with a white, airy 
living room furnished in oversized white sofas and a corner table covered with 
dozens of framed family photographs. "I'm going to instantly know 50 people 
when we get to Baltimore," says the actor, settling on a sofa. "That's nice. I 
travel so much -- three, six months out of the year -- and I don't want to be a 
gypsy. But this is my life. I have a good collection of friends, and I like to 
keep in touch." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Mantegna is regarded by his wide circle of acquaintances as the most 
loyal of friends and an inveterate family man, "as good as they get," says 
Gregory Mosher, director of New York's Lincoln Center Theater and Mamet's 
longtime director. 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna's two daughters, 3-year-old Mia Marie and 4-month-old Gina Christine, 
are in the next room with their nanny. His wife is out somewhere, scouting new 
office space for her brownie business. During the next several hours, a 
limousine must be ordered, schedules must be coordinated, phones answered, 
children fed. One senses that Mantegna is deeply rooted in his family's 
rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
This home-centered contentment is more than just the happy circumstances of the 
actor's off-screen persona; it is the hard-won result of a life of hard knocks, 
the fulcrum for Mantegna's on-screen rogues' gallery of tough guys. "He wants 
to be known as old Joe," says John Leckel, Mantegna's first drama teacher. "But 
he has an iron discipline, an incredible ego and a need for acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
"Joe is complex without being neurotic," explains Mosher, who has known 
Mantegna since the director's days as artistic head of Chicago's Goodman 
Theatre. "He has had a long, tough climb. But it's the guy with a huge heart 
that is best equipped to play villains, and Joey has vast emotional reserves to 
create characters with moral and ethical ambiguities." 
</P>
<P>
Mention these observations to Mantegna, and he becomes predictably 
self-effacing. "If there is that in my performances -- that empathy -- then 
that is what I am after. That's the secret of playing a character like that. 
You can scream and be angry, and that's more fun and easier than being 
sensitive. But you become stereotypical. There has to be more to it to make it 
special." 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna's brand of specialness, the result of honing his craft, is just coming 
to fruition. While he happily acknowledges that "David (Mamet) has given me 
high visibility with those kinds of characters," he says that this past year 
"was an actor's dream. . . . What I liked about doing Woody's movie was that he 
obviously sees something in me, something that other (directors) didn't. I get 
to play a regular guy. I'm more anxious to see this movie than the 'Godfather.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
The regular guy whom Mantegna plays in "Alice" is a musician and divorced 
father who woos and wins his ex-wife (Judy Davis) as well as the honeyed, 
moneyed, repressed wife (portrayed by Mia Farrow) of a domineering Wall Street 
banker (William Hurt). It is a performance that Mantegna describes as "playing 
me more than a character. I'm playing Joe Mantegna more than at any other 
time." 
</P>
<P>
"Joe's a totally natural talent," Allen says. "He makes any line of written 
dialogue sound like a real person talking." Adds Juliet Taylor, Allen's 
longtime casting director: "We were looking for an actor to carry the film's 
emotional weight, and there are only so many people who are that compelling. 
Joe is an actor that a lot of us have admired, but to know him is to know that 
Joe exudes a warm, appealing reality." 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna has the reputation of being something close to a director's dream: 
"He's done a lot of work beforehand," Roos says. "He doesn't need a lot of 
direction, and he never pulls any attitude." Even when discussing the reclusive 
and demanding Allen, Mantegna simply smiles. "Well, fun is the wrong word. He's 
different. If you're an actor who demands a lot from your director, this is not 
your guy. It's not like I could say, 'Hey Woody, let's rap.' He's so quiet and 
shy and retiring. But I went into it thinking, 'It's Woody Allen, I love what 
he does, and even if it's horrible, this too shall end.' " 
</P>
<P>
About Allen's notorious habit of reshooting, Mantegna shrugs. "Your first 
impulse is to say, 'It's me; they saw the dailies, and they want another 
actor.' But usually Woody would just say, 'What you did the first time was 
fine.' I'm not that much of a directing student. Just tell me where to stand, 
and I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
"Alice," which was slated to finish shooting in November, 1989, didn't finish 
until this April, nearly six months beyond its original wrap date, creating a 
scheduling conflict for Mantegna, who was needed in Italy for "Godfather III" 
in December of last year. He had to fly to Rome, film his scenes, then fly back 
to New York for "Alice." "Woody didn't want me to blow the 'Godfather,' and he 
could have wrecked it," says Mantegna. "I remember I finished in Rome on 
Monday, flew out on Tuesday and was back in New York shooting with Woody on 
Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
It is a similar kind of insouciant professionalism that Mantegna brought to his 
work in "Godfather III," one of the more crisis-attended, gossip-mongered 
productions in recent years. "Yeah, I read the press about how Francis 
(Coppola) just directs from his monitors in his metal cylinder -- the 
Silverfish. But I found him to give the actors what they needed. I mean, with 
Francis it's more grand opera. Let's face it, it is the 'Godfather.' His 
attention to videos and electronic monitors seems wise. I mean, when you're 
making a picture that is like $10,000 a minute, you want to cover yourself." 
</P>
<P>
"This was one of the easiest roles for Francis to cast," co-producer Roos says 
of Mantegna's Zasa. "A Mediterranean-looking Italian, a man who could be hard 
but also a bit of a dandy and showoff. We knew that Joe could do all those 
things." Mantegna is cautious when describing his own performance. "People ask 
me, 'Do you play a good guy or a bad guy?' I say, 'Who the hell are the good 
guys in the "Godfather?" ' I'm a guy -- not a blood relative of the Corleones. 
I start out as part of the family and go askew of them, a rival-to-the-throne 
type. It's not like Al (Pacino) or Andy (Garcia) or the crux of the movie, but 
it's a good role, and I'm very happy with it. I mean, I don't really have 
career goals. If I just stay where I am at, what could be better?" he adds, 
sounding less like a Hollywood success story than a guy who feels lucky just to 
have a job. 
</P>
<P>
There is something about Mantegna that resembles a kid with his nose pressed to 
the shop window. He is quick to say, "Ask anybody that knows me, nothing ever 
comes easy for me." This actor weathered one of the most visible roles of his 
life -- playing opposite Madonna on Broadway in "Speed-the-Plow" -- with a rare 
facial disease that several producers misinterpreted as the effects of a 
stroke. But his knock-on-wood fatalism is perhaps most evident in the way he 
downplays his rather exclusive relationship with one of the country's leading 
playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
"David never says, 'I wrote this for you.' It's always, 'I've got this (script) 
and I think you'd be good.' That's it. It's so informal it's like a joke. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in school, so much of what I was reading was written with New 
Yorkers in mind," Mantegna says. "You know, knishes and the BMT, and if you're 
from Chicago you go 'What the hell is this?' Right away you're at a certain 
disadvantage. What I feel about Mamet is that you don't have to do so much 
homework." 
</P>
<P>
There is a pause. "I know the kind of people David is talking about. There was 
this other world out there that intrigued him, and he sought it out and wrote 
about it. He was from the South Side, his father was a lawyer and he had a 
little more privileged life. I didn't have to seek that world out. It didn't 
intrigue me, I was part of it. I know what it was like to come home at night 
and see the cops drag slot machines from the corner bar, see your friends get 
arrested, get shot. It was just part of life." 
</P>
<P>
THE SECOND SON OF second-generation Sicilian and Italian parents, Mantegna, the 
man for whom "nothing comes easy," was born in Al Capone's hometown because of 
his own family's misfortune. Tuberculosis had killed his grandfather on the 
family farm in Oklahoma, "and my grandmother packed my father and my uncle, who 
had also caught TB from the cows, off to Chicago." The illness left its mark 
and imbued Mantegna with a sense of "Italian fatalism," says one old friend. 
</P>
<P>
"My father had a lot of medical problems," recalls the actor. "We didn't see 
him much when I was growing up. He traveled a lot, and for four years he was in 
a sanitarium in New York where they wheeled you out in the mountain air." They 
were a small family for an Italian household: two boys, an ailing father and a 
mother who worked, all housed in a tiny apartment. "My father couldn't really 
support us, so my mother did," Mantegna says. "She wrapped packages in the 
mail-order department at Sears." He was eight years younger than his brother 
Ronald, who today is an advertising executive in Chicago. "If there's an 
Italian word for mensch, he's it," Mantegna says. "He was more like a father to 
me than a brother." 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna attended Morton East High School, a sprawling place full of the 
children of second-generation Czechs, Poles and Italians where "you had the 
guys who were real criminals, then there were the Beaver Cleaver types. I was 
somewhere in between," he says. "I was something of a wise guy." 
</P>
<P>
It was a largely unremarkable four years except for the influence of one man -- 
John Leckel, the school drama teacher who ran a quasi-professional theater 
training program at two high schools and junior college. "Jack used to bid on 
used Broadway sets and get them for our productions," recalls Mantegna. It is 
Leckel whom Mantegna credits with having changed his life. "A lot of my friends 
were going to college, but I didn't have the money to go anywhere, and Jack 
said, 'Stay and do the plays here.' So I did -- 'Hamlet,' 'Merchant of Venice,' 
'Brigadoon.' I was a big frog in a little pond, but I was beginning to get a 
sense that I might be good." 
</P>
<P>
"He was the most outstanding student I ever had," says Leckel today. "Joe came 
from no money, had no family ties to the business; he just did everything 
right. He was a song-and-dance man who was also funny and who could act. You 
don't run across a kid like that very often." 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't for Jack," Mantegna says, "I don't think I would be in this 
business." It was an almost surrogate father-son relationship; while keeping 
the crazy late hours of the theater world, Mantegna would frequently wind up on 
his teacher's doorstep, where he would be invited in to cook a meal and spend 
the night on the couch. During his stint playing in a high school rock band, 
"The Apocryphals," Mantegna persuaded his teacher to co-sign a $10,000 loan for 
equipment. "He was always the most responsible kid," Leckel says. "He was this 
little adult. He knew how to manipulate those around him." 
</P>
<P>
It was an attitude that Mantegna took with him to Chicago's prestigious Goodman 
School of Drama, which he attended on a partial scholarship. He studied at 
Goodman for two years, leaving a year shy of graduation because he landed a 
role in the Chicago production of "Hair" in 1969. After that came a slot in the 
musical "Godspell." "I was making 300 bucks a week, which was a lot of money 
for a 21-year-old kid in 1969," says Mantegna about those early jobs. "I 
remember saying, 'Who said this is tough?' But I didn't make that kind of money 
for the next 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
For the next several years, Mantegna, newly married to Arlene, a "Hair" 
co-star, weathered some lean times, working largely at the Organic Theater. "I 
was the master of unemployment, I really worked that sister," he recalls. It 
was the pre-Steppenwolf Chicago theater era, and the Organic, the Goodman and 
the infamous Second City were the only games in town. Those, and Mamet's own 
theater, the nascent St. Nicholas Theatre. "We were pretty much a small group," 
Mantegna says, "and we all kept thinking we would eventually have to move to 
one coast or another, but the work seemed good." 
</P>
<P>
It was during this time that Mantegna and a handful of fellow actors wrote and 
performed a play, "Bleacher Bums," as a way of getting more work. The play ran 
for one season in Chicago, then moved to New York and was later televised and 
taped; the eight actors and director, Stuart Gordon, each received an Emmy. "In 
a business where it is not the hallmark, Joe was extremely well-grounded," 
recalls Richard Fire, artistic director of the Organic Theater and one of the 
play's co-authors. "You could really depend on him." 
</P>
<P>
Later came the move to Los Angeles in 1978, a sort of collective migration of 
Chicago actors, including Mantegna, Dennis Franz and Richard Gilliland. "I came 
because it was California, it was warm and I went nuts," says Mantegna. "I had 
been in (Studs Terkel's play) 'Working' off-Broadway, and the idea of staying 
in New York, it was like another Chicago. So I came out here and lived off 
unemployment and my photography business for years. It took me six months to 
get an agent, and then they dumped me because I didn't get any work." 
</P>
<P>
They were tough but happy times, Mantegna recalls now. He and Arlene lived in a 
small Valley apartment, making ends meet with a series of odd jobs. "I'd get 
one acting job about every six months," says Mantegna. "But it was great. We'd 
go to the beach, have dinner at a friend's house." By 1983, he was back in 
Chicago debuting Ricky Roma, finally on his way. 
</P>
<P>
THE STORY OF THE first meeting between actor and playwright in 1974 has 
acquired legendary status among their friends. Mantegna was slogging through 
his fallow post-"Hair" period by performing at the Organic. "Mamet had seen our 
work and came to us with 'Sexual Perversity in Chicago,' and I said 'No.' Smart 
move," says Mantegna with a laugh. "But I had already been cast as the 
understudy in 'Lenny' that summer, and they were paying me more. I liked his 
play, but I didn't know Mamet from the man in the moon." 
</P>
<P>
It would be two years before Mantegna would work with Mamet, in a Chicago 
production of "A Life in the Theater." It would be another six years before the 
two would collaborate again -- in the 1982 production of Mamet's lesser-known 
work, "The Disappearance of the Jews," performed at the Goodman Theatre. It 
wasn't until Mantegna played Roma, the shark-like, small-town real estate 
salesman in "Glengarry Glen Ross" in 1983, that the actor-playwright 
relationship bloomed. The production ran for more than two years -- Chicago, a 
national tour and finally Broadway; Mantegna won a Tony and Mamet the Pulitzer 
Prize. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe became a very powerful actor with that role," says actress Lindsay Crouse, 
Mamet's former wife, who played opposite Mantegna in "House of Games." "Joe 
gained tremendous self-confidence during the run." 
</P>
<P>
According to Crouse and other acquaintances (Mamet has declined any interviews 
for several years), the chemistry between actor and writer has less to do with 
camaraderie than it does with artistry. "Joe is the voice of those characters 
that David writes best -- he is 'The Guy,' " Crouse adds. "As a writer, you 
search for someone who comes close to that voice in your head, and when Joe 
opens his mouth, it's him, and David knows that." 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna is less certain. "Did Mamet tell you that I'm 'The Guy?' " he asks. 
"I've read that, but never once has he told me that. David is David. It's the 
dilemma I have of describing a guy I've known for 15 years. We're very close on 
some levels, we're not on others. I like the way he writes, and he sees 
something in me that he likes as a performer, and I'm comfortable with that." 
</P>
<P>
Mosher, who has worked with both actor and writer for many years, calls it a 
symbiotic relationship that works because of the duo's shared landscape. "There 
is nothing European about Joe; he's not New York, like Pacino or Hoffman. He's 
another point on the compass. There is nobody like him, if you think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet being "The Guy" for one of the country's most acclaimed dramatists, whose 
use of language has been compared to British dramatist Harold Pinter's, holds 
its own challenges. "Mamet's a guy who is very conscious of writing in a 
certain rhythm -- iambic pentameter. When he writes, you can sometimes see him 
tapping it out with a pen," says Mantegna. "Not a lot of writers actually work 
out the beats. That's why you can't casually change a line." 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna admits that Roma's first speech in "Glengarry," a 15-minute monologue, 
"was probably the most difficult thing I've ever done. It's tough enough to do 
Mamet, but when it's a stream-of-consciousness thing, it's like learning the 
Gettysburg Address in Japanese. There are no external reference points, and if 
you get lost -- like I did on opening night -- you just can't vamp it to get 
back on track. With David, it's like doing Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
If the playwright's use of language has occasionally flummoxed the actor, 
Mamet's characters -- salty-tongued, tough-minded salesman and hustlers -- have 
proven less elusive. "The trick is that different personalties gravitate 
towards different occupations," Mantegna says, "so whether it's a real estate 
salesman or a studio head or a con man, the trick is to find that aspect of his 
personality that makes him do that thing, that job. . . . So I look at the 
script and say, 'What is this guy about?' " 
</P>
<P>
Mantegna admits that his approach to acting differs from that of Mamet, who has 
been an acting teacher. "David is very heavy into Stanislavsky, but that's not 
my background," says the actor. "I look at the script, and I use parts of 
myself and people that I know to help me become that guy. I put together a 
composite, and that includes the way I look, talk and behave." 
</P>
<P>
For most of Mamet's characters, Mantegna says it comes down to discovering why 
those characters believe in themselves. "Regardless of how evil a person is -- 
I mean Hitler didn't think he was a bad guy -- they don't start the day 
thinking who they can screw that day," explains Mantegna. "They think what they 
are doing is best for themselves. Ricky Roma, Mike Mancuso, Bobby Gould, these 
guys believed in what they did. So I play that character who is totally in love 
with himself. David does not write guys who don't love themselves. He writes 
about strong men, and he will give as much integrity to a thief as he will to 
an average guy." 
</P>
<P>
THE SOFT CALIFORNIA afternoon has grown longer. Mantegna's wife is home, and a 
crowd of several co-workers, children and the nanny gathers in the kitchen. For 
a moment, there is a discussion of a moving van and feeding schedules. 
Mantegna, still on the couch, begins to whistle the theme song from "I Love 
Lucy," until his daughter Mia Marie wanders in from her nap. "Yeah, this one," 
he says, pulling his child into his lap, "was born four months premature. I 
could talk to you for hours about that." 
</P>
<P>
And then he begins to recall the filming of "Weeds," the 1987 prison drama 
starring Nick Nolte, which was shot in Stateville, one of the country's 
toughest maximum security prisons, in Joliet, Ill.; actual convicts worked as 
extras. "I remember we shot one scene," says Mantegna, slowly stroking his 
daughter's hair, "and I looked over -- there was Richard Speck -- remember 
Speck, who killed about 20 women in Chicago in the '60s? Behind those eyes 
there was just this killer." 
</P>
<P>
There is a pause. "Yeah, in the 'Godfather' I play a guy who's killed people. 
How do I get to that point?" he asks, looking down at his daughter. "I think 
about what I would do if someone threatened my family. I remember the night she 
was born. The doctor saying 'Sign this paper so we can give her oxygen, but it 
might cause blindness. Now sign this, so we can do this to her, but it might 
cause brain damage,' " he says, looking up. "And there you were thinking you 
were going to have a kid. What fun. Just like on TV, just like everybody else. 
Forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
"But it could be worse. She could be dead, but she's not. She's healthy, and 
this is my project for the next 18 years, get her on her way. Yeah, nothing 
comes easy, but nobody ever promised it me it was going to be a free ride." 
</P>
<P>
Still stroking his daughter's hair, Mantegna turns toward the window. "It takes 
a long time to pay your dues, and I do think the business goes through phases," 
says Mantegna. "I didn't really know what it would be like. It's torture to 
come up with a character and do it eight times a week whether you're sick or 
not. But for every moment I think of that, I think of the guy who's stamping 
out fenders in Pontiac."

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Banking away from the freeways toward the seashore, Laguna Canyon Road fairly 
sings of the beauty, escape and fun ahead. It skims past a shallow lagoon, then 
sweeps by towering eucalyptus trees and cattle grazing on hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
The road spills out onto Coast Highway and Main Beach, where on a warm fall day 
the carefree and the bronzed play volleyball and bask in the sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
In town, beyond the cookie and T-shirt shops, designer boutiques of gold and 
silk, Marieta Ermatinger, 63, stands in her laundry, The Cleaners, and talks of 
a side of Laguna that belies this idyllic picture. 
</P>
<P>
It's a world she has come to know through some of her customers. She liked them 
and knew their names. Much cleaner than your average single male, they turned 
their socks right side out and paired them. Not even women do that, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, all of a sudden, one day, they just didn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
Some had mentioned that they were dying of AIDS and probably wouldn't be 
bringing in their laundry much longer. On others she recognized the cancerous 
purple splotches or gauntness that signaled the infections within. 
</P>
<P>
A few were only kids in their 20s. One was a street person who brought in his 
sleeping bag for cleaning. The last one, a successful real estate agent, went 
-- snap! -- just like that, only the week before. 
</P>
<P>
Some people ask her, how can you do their laundry? "I say they need laundry 
done like anybody else. I'm not sleeping with them for chrissakes." 
</P>
<P>
The laundress dropped her chin into her palms, elbows on the counter. She 
stared unseeing out the front windows, past the whiz of cars, to the shimmering 
sea beyond. The scent of bleach lingered in the breeze. "Gosh," she said, 
shaking her head, "we've lost a lot of guys in this town." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years into the epidemic, the ugly face of AIDS has surfaced in this 
picturesque community like no other. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city's annual rate of new cases was 1.42 per 1,000 people, 
surpassing the 1.29 rate in San Francisco, the highest among major U.S. cities, 
according to the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics come as no surprise to those who know that the town is a gay 
tourist mecca, where an estimated 25% of the 26,000 residents are gay. Since 
1985, there have been 184 AIDS cases reported in Laguna Beach; 119 have died. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, unlike San Francisco, AIDS in Laguna Beach remains curiously invisible to 
outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see people (with lesions) in restaurants. People don't talk about it 
nearly as much, even gay people," said Randy Shilts, author of the AIDS history 
"And the Band Played On." "It's striking how different it is down here. In some 
quarters you wouldn't even know it existed." 
</P>
<P>
One reason, he said, is that "the reality of AIDS is so contrary to the 
Southern California ethos of youth and beauty." 
</P>
<P>
Some also mention both the complex social structure of the town -- a molecular 
arrangement of cliques that intersect occasionally -- and the vested interest 
in denying the epidemic held by a few shopkeepers, arts promoters and closet 
gays. 
</P>
<P>
"Laguna Beach is an oxymoron," said local writer and arts commissioner David 
Battenberg, who has lived in town for five years. "It's a 
creative-liberal-artistic, conservative-Republican community. You have die-hard 
supporters of radical right-wingers living at the top of the hill and their 
neighbors are a retired gay couple from Dallas who made a fortune in the design 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Among the gays, there's a hierarchy. At the top there's the landholders, the 
money people and the executives. At the bottom, the new youth, the wayward boys 
of summer who hang out across from the gym or on Main Beach. In the middle are 
the guppies -- the gay upwardly mobile -- and the art group. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unusual cross-section. You'd think that would make everyone more 
understanding. It doesn't. Sometimes it makes them more hostile and closed." 
</P>
<P>
Only by delving beneath the resort's surface, exploring its bars, beaches and 
living rooms, can one understand the complex fabric of the community, where 
nearly everyone has been touched by the specter of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
As early as the 1920s, gays began traveling to Laguna, a popular filming 
location, as part of the Hollywood movie crowd. 
</P>
<P>
A tourist core developed and announced to the rest of Southern California, 
"It's OK to be non-traditional and come to this community," said Robert F. 
Gentry, a city councilman and one of the first openly gay elected officials in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
The beatniks, the hippies, the Hare Krishnas all followed. 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s, word spread along a newly formed national underground that gays 
could vacation safely in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In the following decade, while middle-class homeowners were starting to 
transform the village with condos, Laguna emerged as a destination resort for 
gays, rivaling Fire Island in New York and Provincetown, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by a growing sense of freedom, tolerance and possibility, gays drank and 
danced together on weekends at Dante's and the Barefoot Bar near Main Beach, at 
the end of the canyon. Gay weddings were held on the front lawns of tree-lined 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
One 58-year-old resident who came out of the closet in the '70s remembered the 
exhilaration of liberation. "We thought, 'We're OK! We can be who we are. We 
can have sex when we want to. It doesn't matter.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the '70s, the city renovated Main Beach, demolishing the gay bars and 
building a boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Party life moved south down Coast Highway. Older, wealthier men tended to 
gather at the Little Shrimp, a piano bar; the younger crowd at the Boom Boom 
Room, a disco in the Coast Inn. Meanwhile, up in the cliff-top homes, wealthy 
party givers engaged in friendly competition over who could throw the most 
creative events. 
</P>
<P>
A "pig party" started as a luau, but wound up as an annual tribute to the pig 
after the hosts didn't have the heart to kill it. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Jorgensen was a favorite party guest. Rock Hudson stayed in the 
hillsides, quietly visiting friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Laguna is a sad place for me now," said a Los Angeles film designer who has 
lost a dozen friends he partied with in his Laguna Beach home. "I don't want to 
say it's a graveyard. But it's not the same because of the deaths." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've lost anyone not ambitious, not productive, not creative. 
They were all in the midst of wonderful careers and things to do, things to 
accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
"I only have two friends left in Laguna Beach." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the town received a guest who symbolized the devastation to come: The 
flight attendant who became famous as "Patient Zero." 
</P>
<P>
One of the first half-dozen AIDS patients in the continent, Gaetan Dugas 
already had Kaposi's sarcoma when he spent Thanksgiving weekend in Laguna Beach 
with a hairdresser he had met in West Hollywood, author Shilts said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after researchers had placed Dugas at the center of a national cluster 
diagram establishing sexual links between 40 patients of a new mysterious 
disease in 10 cities, he began to brag that he was "the Orange County 
connection." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to doctors' orders, Dugas said he would not give up sex, and was 
accused of maliciously spreading AIDS in San Francisco bathhouses. Dugas, who 
died in 1984, claimed that he had had 2,500 sexual partners. 
</P>
<P>
"Half of Laguna slept with him," said one of his former lovers. 
</P>
<P>
Although some gays loved Laguna Beach for its propriety, others were caught up 
in the social undertow of booze, drugs and promiscuous sex. Parties grew 
wilder, fueled by cocaine and amyl nitrite "poppers." 
</P>
<P>
For years, some of the most notorious gatherings were given by two middle-aged 
doctors, Sheldon (Shelly) Lippe and James (Bud) Waren, in their 
4,000-square-foot home on Coast Highway overlooking the sea. The doctors, a 
urologist and an anesthesiologist, drove custom-made Clenet automobiles with 
Lalique hood ornaments, a Mercedes-Benz and a Rolls-Royce, and owned a crystal 
shop in town. Their home, decorated haphazardly with expensive crystal 
knickknacks and ceramic animals, contained a sex room filled with pornographic 
art. 
</P>
<P>
Guests recalled that parties sometimes lasted three days, with revelers culled 
from the Boom Boom or the Little Shrimp after-hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to hang out and invite people back for parties or just for the night. 
We had a lot of those," recalled Lippe, 52. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing jeans and Gucci loafers, Lippe sat on a Dartmouth green leather couch 
in the living room of the woodsy hilltop home where he now lives. 
</P>
<P>
The parties, which cost about $10,000 each, were so popular, he said, they 
started renting entire hotels for hundreds of young men and a few women. About 
800 revelers attended one hotel party where male and female models were hired 
to swim nude in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
One guest was Matthew Hamlin, a handsome horse trainer who had discovered he 
was gay at 19 and moved to Laguna Beach, the only town in California he felt he 
could call home. Hamlin knew his looks had put him on the doctors' guest list. 
Naturally blond, tanned and well-muscled, he appeared to be a "Twinkie" -- an 
airhead looking for a good time. 
</P>
<P>
"I fit their type to a 'T,' " he said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Among the first to die in the epidemic were some of Hamlin's friends, a 
bartender at the Boom Boom Room and an arts commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"We all thought it wouldn't happen to us," Hamlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty of his friends from those days, half of whom were lovers, had died of 
AIDS, Hamlin said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Lippe and Waren learned they were HIV positive. Waren died a "slow and 
ugly death" the following year, Hamlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Lippe, disabled by an AIDS-related neurological disorder, lives at home with 
the help of full-time staff. Lippe said he has lost 100 friends to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
His only regret is that "this virus came along . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I had a wonderful life. I wish (those days) were back again." 
</P>
<P>
Hamlin tested positive for HIV in 1985 and was found to have AIDS three years 
ago, when he was 32. 
</P>
<P>
On a warm September afternoon, he sat dressed in a small T-shirt and drawstring 
pants on the patio of a friend's condominium, where he was living, combing back 
his shoulder-length hair with his fingers and smoking designer cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
He had become a popular AIDS activist, lecturing students and counseling others 
-- appearing to be the role model of a person living well with AIDS. He 
continued to work, training horses at a San Juan Capistrano stable but keeping 
his health problems secret from his employers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his private life had entered the spirals of hope, fear, denial and 
spiritual reckoning that accompany the new medications, financial problems and 
increasing isolation so familiar to AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his medication, he continued to drink, countering his own better 
judgment with a "what difference does it make?" argument. 
</P>
<P>
He also confided that under certain circumstances, he would consider suicide, 
probably via an overdose. He had already written instructions for his memorial 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The disease had progressed to the point where he started confronting feelings 
of rejection. "It's been difficult for people to be my friends," he said. "I 
had a lot of anger." 
</P>
<P>
He tried to socialize, going out to the bars in his jeans and cowboy boots, and 
he dated, although he was much choosier about his partners, insisting on safe 
sex and only with those already HIV-infected. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to know you'd be desirable to somebody," he said. "It's human 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
But behind the appearance of coping, he was enduring night sweats, swollen 
glands, yeast infections in his mouth, colitis and 30 other opportunistic 
infections. His body stopped tolerating the drug AZT, and his memory began to 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
He said he didn't think he would live much longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so tired of it," he said. "It gets too crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Just before Thanksgiving, Beverly Hamlin knew something was wrong. Matthew 
didn't answer the phone, and when she went over to the La Habra rental home 
where he had just moved, his car was there. 
</P>
<P>
She found her son's body on a sofa. Nearby was his dog, a half-empty glass of 
wine, a full ashtray and three empty bottles of morphine-based prescription 
pain pills. 
</P>
<P>
He left a note that said he was sorry; that he couldn't stand the pain any 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
She had known this might be coming. She had given him her permission. 
</P>
<P>
"He watched so many people suffer. He didn't ever want to go through that. 
</P>
<P>
"People can rise above it, like Matthew did," she said. "But it's always there. 
It's always there." 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 1, World AIDS Day, about 175 family and personal friends gathered in 
the glass-walled United Methodist Church in South Laguna. On one side were the 
chaparral-covered hills, on the other the pale yellow sea. 
</P>
<P>
The pastor read Hamlin's own words, as he had requested: "I believe that God 
gave me a life here on earth that's had its ups and downs, but I've really 
enjoyed living and for the most part I've had a ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I also want people to know that I'm proud of who I am as a gay man, and know 
that AIDS was not God's punishment for who I am and what I've done." 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Police Officer Bob August rolled up Laguna's foothills, past 
his alma mater, Laguna Beach High School, to a medical aid call at an 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
An artist had shot himself in the head. The man had been losing his hair in 
patches. What pushed him over the edge, police learned from his therapist, was 
blindness caused by a disease August had heard of but never encountered. 
</P>
<P>
When they arrived, no one -- not even the coroner -- was sure of what to do. 
Blood had soaked the carpet all around the body. Scared and cautious, they each 
put on two pairs of gloves and paint masks to carry out the body. Some wore 
rain boots. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as more people are living longer with the disease, the AIDS calls usually 
involve late-night fevers and pneumonias. August has seen the full range -- 
from transients who sell their bodies for $2 on the beach to the very rich. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to houses where there are two Mercedeses in the garage. He's got all 
this stuff. He's 45. After he worked his fanny off to get it. It doesn't seem 
fair," August said. 
</P>
<P>
Often the men now insist the police take precautions to protect themselves. 
"One gentleman, gosh, a few weeks ago, said, 'I have Kaposi's sarcoma all over 
my legs. Please be careful of the lesions. They are weeping.' 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed to be a hopeful type of person, taking his medication properly. A 
lot give up hope and stop taking medication," August said. 
</P>
<P>
On the force, where some remember the undercover squads that used to prowl 
public bathrooms for come-ons from gays, no one jokes about AIDS anymore. In 
lengthy job interviews, the police chief tries to weed out homophobes. And 
increasingly, younger officers tell him, "My brother's out. My sister's a 
lesbian. It's not a big thing." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the biggest, most creative private parties in town are AIDS benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The city has championed AIDS causes, welcoming a skilled nursing facility for 
AIDS patients; funding Laguna Shanti, a support organization for people who 
have tested HIV positive; and setting aside $10,000 to begin direct patient 
services. It created the county's only municipal AIDS education task force and 
passed an anti-discrimination ordinance based on HIV status. 
</P>
<P>
But shards from the original scare linger. 
</P>
<P>
An unsuccessful shopkeeper blames bad business on AIDS -- although business 
revenue is rising citywide. 
</P>
<P>
A cultural leader says he has had no experience with AIDS at work, then 
concedes he is "terrified" that any association with AIDS may hurt the arts 
community. 
</P>
<P>
A Laguna Beach interior decorator, who has lost nine close friends, said his 
out-of-town guests refuse to eat in Laguna restaurants, afraid they might catch 
AIDS from waiters or cooks. 
</P>
<P>
Some men have quit going to the local gym where AIDS patients work out, said 
Laguna therapist Stuart Bloom. "There is such fear and ignorance and lack of 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand it to some degree. Now they say you can't get it from sweat. 
But what's going to happen in three years? Will they say the same thing? It is 
a terrible disease. We're talking about death. People are real scared." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that the prevalence of AIDS adds to the general homophobia, it 
frightens some younger gay men into denial. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that made AIDS so difficult for gay people to deal with in 
Laguna is that so many of them are not comfortable with their own identity," 
said Tim Miller, director of the AIDS Response Program. He has seen four 
friends a year die since 1984, including his own longtime companion in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In their obituaries, the local papers rarely mention AIDS as a cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
The door of Laguna Shanti is open to the evening air. The room is quiet except 
for the sound of a few passing cars. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Costa, the instructor of the Hot 'n Healthy safe-sex workshop, glances at 
the roomful of 10 gay men, all of whom have tested HIV positive, and asks, "So, 
what do you miss most as a result of the AIDS epidemic?" 
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged man in jeans and running shoes raises his hand. Oral sex, he 
says, in common slang. 
</P>
<P>
As chipper and unfazed as Dr. Ruth, Costa turns around and repeats the 
syllables slowly as he writes on the board behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"OK!" he says, and spins around brightly. "Anybody else?" 
</P>
<P>
They mention group sex. Unrestricted bathhouses. One man says he misses the 
pride he once felt to be gay. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the men appear to be under 30, two are married. Another two have the 
shrunken look of the later phases of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
A man with movie-star looks said he is a teacher, a coach and the father of 
three. He is holding hands with a gaunt man, who, despite his illness, presents 
a cheerful, joking demeanor to the class. 
</P>
<P>
Though they are infected already, they have come because they do not want to 
infect others. 
</P>
<P>
As Costa explores two of the most challenging matters to confront openly -- sex 
and death -- the atmosphere takes on a surreal quality. Pleasure . . . death . 
. . pleasure . . . death. 
</P>
<P>
Costa brings out a box of rubber dildos and passes them out. The men practice 
putting on condoms with, as Costa has told them, only water-based lubricants. 
Pleasure . . . death . . . pleasure . . . death. 
</P>
<P>
They role-play picking up a date and practice negotiating for safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Costa asks them: What's good about the AIDS epidemic? The return of 
dating, say some. Romance. Candlelight. Love letters. Porno movies. 
</P>
<P>
A white-haired gentleman in shorts and deck shoes folds his arms across his 
chest. Quite honestly, he says, he can't think of a single thing. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, in a weathered wooden office building, Dr. Leonard Lamont is 
winding down his year-old practice -- currently said to be the only one in 
Laguna Beach that accepts HIV or AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
He says the number of time-consuming cases, the emotional intensity and the 
lack of support from other doctors has burned him out. 
</P>
<P>
"I had appendicitis for three weeks, and couldn't get (other doctors to cover 
for him so he could) see another physician. The appendix ruptured, I developed 
peritonitis and nearly died." 
</P>
<P>
When he was in the hospital, he learned that one of his 70 AIDS or HIV patients 
had died. 
</P>
<P>
"I cried when I heard he died. I couldn't take care of him myself. 
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the characters of the century. A great guy. He and his 
significant other would come in and they were always fighting in a jovial way." 
</P>
<P>
Lamont, 33, delighted in coming to Laguna when he was a student at UC Irvine 
and looked forward to opening a practice there. 
</P>
<P>
He had expected 20% of his clients to be AIDS patients. Instead, they composed 
40% and took up 80% of his time. 
</P>
<P>
After he leaves for his new job at the Long Beach Naval Hospital, he believes 
his patients will do well. A new comprehensive treatment and research center 
for HIV and AIDS called the Center of Special Immunology opened Monday in the 
Irvine Spectrum, at the other end of Laguna Canyon Road, where it joins the 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida-based center chose the site because of the high incidence of 
infection in the area and what spokesman Matthew Klir called "an alarming 
reluctance on the part of the medical community to respond." 
</P>
<P>
Turning seaward from Coast Highway, Mountain Avenue stops at the cliff. 
</P>
<P>
A lone drinker sits behind a glass of wine in the nearly empty Boom Boom Room 
and looks beyond the dead end toward Santa Catalina Island and a tangerine 
sunset. 
</P>
<P>
At the bar, Michael, 24, wipes glasses and prepares for the early evening 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he hardly knew anyone who had AIDS. Now, as the 
bartender/confidant in a small town where news travels fast, he has heard many 
disheartening stories of the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
He has lost three friends himself, he says. "And that's enough." 
</P>
<P>
The Boom Boom has been for sale for two years -- a prospect cheered by a 
certain element in town, he said. "It's here and it's been here for years," he 
said. "If they can't deal with it, it's their problem." If it changes hands, 
however, many think it will no longer be a gay bar, and Michael will have to 
look for work. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors on Mountain Avenue say late-night revelry hasn't changed in eight 
years. But Michael says both customers and drinking are down. So is sexual 
misconduct, since management installed brighter lights in the black-walled 
dancing room. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he says, for some unknown reason, there is no longer a condom machine in 
the bathroom. And, really, no one except tourists read the safe-sex brochures 
stuffed below the bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it is filled with ads for roommates and massages. 
</P>
<P>
Over them, someone's friend has tacked up a torn piece of legal paper with a 
neatly penciled note. It announces a memorial service. Directions to 
Fisherman's Cove and a time are given. 
</P>
<P>
"Please," it says, "don't wear black."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana Police Department and the California Highway Patrol began the 
Christmas season this weekend with the first in a series of sobriety 
checkpoints designed to make holiday revelers think twice about drinking and 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police opened their first checkpoint of the season Friday night at 
McFadden and Standard avenues, Police Sgt. Bob Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
That checkpoint resulted in 28 arrests and confiscation of 46 vehicles, Clark 
said. He could not explain the discrepancy between the number of cars 
confiscated and the number of suspected drunk drivers arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the city's first sobriety checkpoint of the holiday season was 
welcomed by local businesses and residents, who watched the checkpoints from 
nearby stores and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowds at the scene were very supportive of the checkpoint," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Santa Ana checkpoint was set up in Santa Ana at 7 p.m. Saturday in the 
1600 block of West 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
In South County, the California Highway Patrol set up a checkpoint Saturday 
night at El Toro and Jeronimo roads in El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officer Ken Daily said he hopes that knowledge of the checkpoints will 
prompt a decrease in drinking and driving. "The message is, if they're going to 
a party, they should make alternative travel plans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No information was available late Saturday on the number of cars stopped or the 
number of drivers arrested at the El Toro and 1st Street checkpoints.

DANA PARSONS: CURT PRINGLE'S NOT READY TO TURN HIS BACK ON POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to picture a more unthreatening guy than Curt Pringle. Even today, at 
31, he still looks more like your brainy nephew than a political heavy. 
</P>
<P>
Yet that's the tag Pringle carried into the state Legislature following his 
1988 election victory in Orange County's 71st Assembly District. Pringle, a 
Republican, won a close race, but it was tainted by Election Day disclosures 
that the county Republican Party had paid for uniformed security guards at some 
Santa Ana polling sites because it feared that unregistered Democratic Latino 
voters might show up. 
</P>
<P>
From that moment, Pringle, a political nobody who had lost three previous tries 
for the Garden Grove City Council, became a marked man. Although he denounced 
the use of the guards and was shown to have had no direct role in their hiring, 
he became for some the villainous embodiment of people's worst instincts about 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Pringle got to Sacramento to try to do business with the 
Democrat-controlled Legislature, he might just as well have painted a 
bull's-eye on his back. 
</P>
<P>
On his first day in the Legislature, he was given a temporary office. On his 
second day, he was told the office was no longer his and that he should find 
quarters with a "friendly Republican." A month later, he got an office that he 
says was clearly "the smallest office in the building." 
</P>
<P>
Although he introduced a minimal number of bills, he often found them going 
nowhere fast. Pringle knew what was happening to him, but there was little he 
could do about it. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Pringle lost his first try at reelection. Last week his conqueror, 
Tom Umberg, was sworn in. At 31, Pringle may well be a political has-been. 
</P>
<P>
So, I expected to find a glum Curt Pringle last week. Instead, he seemed 
generally upbeat and able to look with some bemusement on his foray into the 
rough-and-tumble world of Sacramento politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Going in, I knew games were going to be played, but I didn't know how severe 
they were going to be," he said. "It's one thing for me to be able to cope and 
understand the situation. It was another thing for my family, my wife 
particularly. I don't think she's read the paper since 1988, as a matter of 
fact. She says, 'Why should I read the paper when I know firsthand how some 
things have been misconstrued and misrepresented?' " 
</P>
<P>
Although Pringle says he was targeted by Sacramento Democrats mostly because he 
won in a winnable Democratic district, he realizes the poll guard debacle put 
an additional burden on him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said in the paper many times I thought it was inappropriate to have 
anybody in uniform at the polling place. So I guess if you want to say where 
the personal blame is, it's not on me, because it wasn't my decision and it 
wasn't me who paid for them. But the point is it happened during my election, 
it was part of my district where it happened, so I've had to carry the brunt of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The specific nature of the incident has troubled him more, he says, than would 
a more mundane political mistake. "Yeah, because the people who look at it as 
some type of plot against Hispanics bring that back at me. I guess that's what 
hurts the most. We could go back to the '88 election and say that my campaign 
manager -- who was Carlos Rodriguez -- that his first job in politics was to 
work for then-Speaker (of the State Assembly) Leo McCarthy (a Democrat), and 
that he was the Hispanic outreach coordinator for the speaker's office. . . . 
So I guess it's kind of tough when racial innuendoes are made, because it's 
made against me personally. And that is very far from the truth." 
</P>
<P>
So, has he had it with politics? 
</P>
<P>
"I won't say I'm washed up at 31. I still have idealism about politics. I think 
the principles that I had going in haven't been changed. I think it's important 
to get principled people into politics, particularly people who are young 
enough to get in and work and do something. Even though (other people's) 
convictions may not be the same as mine, I think it's important to have 
principled people. Often we don't have principled people who will stand up for 
their values and stand up for what they believe in, regardless of politics." 
</P>
<P>
Pringle always has struck me as a babe in the political woods. I spent an 
all-nighter with him when he won the cliff-hanger in 1988; his most noticeable 
trait that night was his evenness in waiting out the results. He showed neither 
the disposition for political conniving nor the lust for power. I remember 
saying to a colleague that I was curious to see how Sacramento would treat 
young Mr. Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I did have a naive view in that I didn't realize the legislative 
process was as partisan and political as it really is. It's overwhelmingly 
partisan and political. Nearly every public policy issue takes a back seat to 
politics and partisanship, on all sides. That's one of the more disturbing 
aspects. I thought you go in and wrangle and discuss issues of public policy 
that affect the state, but that's one of the last things that gets discussed." 
</P>
<P>
Given all the bad press the Legislature gets, how could he not know that going 
in? "I never realized it was as bad as it was portrayed, and I actually don't 
think it's ever been portrayed as bad as it really is. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, although he says he's happy to be back at work full time in the family 
drapery and window covering business, Pringle hasn't ruled out another shot at 
politics someday. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is, I think I did something good. I believe I stood up for the right 
things, I believe I did my job properly, I believe I worked hard and 
represented this district better than it's ever been represented before. To say 
I think it was a two-year downer, absolutely not. Absolutely not. But if I were 
to look back at some of the things I would have done differently, I'd say maybe 
a few of those dinners I went to, I didn't need to go to, and maybe I should 
have stayed home with my kids and read them another story, if you really want 
to know."

SURROGATE IN CUSTODY CASE SUES HER DOCTOR, HOSPITAL 
</P>

Surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson has filed a $5-million lawsuit alleging that 
the doctor who implanted her with a couple's embryo, as well as those who 
arranged her surrogacy contract, were negligent and caused her severe emotional 
distress, Johnson's attorney said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"No doctor should ever have permitted her to be a surrogate," attorney Richard 
C. Gilbert said. "She is one of the last people on earth who should be a 
surrogate." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert alleges that Johnson was completely unprepared for surrogacy, that she 
had undergone "less than an hour" of psychological counseling and that her 
doctor was aware of her four previous miscarriages and stillbirths when he 
implanted her with the embryo. 
</P>
<P>
The civil suit was filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court. None of those 
named were available Saturday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
However, the baby's father, Mark Calvert, who is not named in the suit, said 
Saturday that Johnson had misrepresented herself and withheld key information 
during the screening. 
</P>
<P>
Calvert said he and his wife, Crispina, would never have contracted with 
Johnson if they had been aware of her medical and personal history. 
</P>
<P>
"Anna Johnson got herself into this situation by not being candid, and for her 
to allege that any other individual was a participant in her omissions is 
ludicrous," Calvert said. 
</P>
<P>
After she was impregnated with a baby boy created from the Calverts' egg and 
sperm, Johnson said she had become bonded to the child and sued to keep the 
baby. In October, Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard N. Parslow Jr. 
ruled that the Calverts are the only legitimate parents and awarded them sole 
custody. Gilbert has vowed to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's lawsuit names Dr. Ricardo Asch and his Center for Reproductive Health 
in Garden Grove, where the implant was performed, as well as William Handle, 
owner of the Center for Surrogacy Parenting in Beverly Hills, who allegedly 
referred the Calverts to Asch, Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accuses Asch of "battery" in performing the procedure when Johnson was 
not fully informed of her legal situation and thus unable to give her informed 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
Asch was out of the country Saturday. Calvert, however, said that Johnson had 
falsely stated that she had been screened and accepted as a surrogate by Handle 
and that she had failed to report her miscarriages, which would have 
disqualified her. 
</P>
<P>
"If Dr. Asch had been aware of one miscarriage or stillbirth, he would not have 
done the procedure," Calvert said. 
</P>
<P>
Also named in the suit is Wendy Leitner, who allegedly "was selected by William 
Handle, purportedly to act as Anna Johnson's attorney in the surrogacy 
contract," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Johnson spoke with Leitner on the telephone, "Anna Johnson has never 
met Wendy Leitner, never hired her and never paid her any money," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Leitner was chosen and paid $300 by the Calverts, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The suit accuses Leitner of legal malpractice because "she failed to properly 
advise Anna about the legal ramifications of this (surrogacy) contract," 
Gilbert said. "Anna was led to believe she had the right to change her mind and 
keep the baby." 
</P>
<P>
Also named is UCI Medical Center in Orange, where Johnson was hospitalized 
during her pregnancy. Gilbert alleged that the hospital failed to hand over to 
Johnson court papers related to her suit, which were served on her while she 
was a patient for two days, until the hospital's own attorneys could review 
them. 
</P>
<P>
He also alleged that hospital officials refused to allow Johnson telephone 
contact with her attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
UCI Medical Center officials were unavailable Saturday.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK DAVAN MAHARAJ: COMPASSION SPRINGS FROM THE PLIGHT OF CANCER 
VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Linda Fisher has bought all her Christmas presents, distributed her belongings 
among her friends and relatives, and is waiting to die. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher is the 41-year-old amputee and terminally ill cancer victim who sparked 
a small controversy because she was living in a recreational vehicle parked in 
front of her cousin's home in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing Fisher in August, I knocked on her neighbors' doors to find 
out exactly who had filed the complaint with the city. At one home, an elderly 
woman opened the door a crack. 
</P>
<P>
She said that she and her husband were concerned that Fisher was turning the 
neighborhood into an RV park and that it could lower the value of their 
$400,000 home. She and her husband had complained to the city's planning 
division that Fisher was violating the city's land-use ordinance that prohibits 
people from living in recreational vehicles in a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
I had wondered why anyone would file such a complaint. They probably didn't 
know that Fisher had been through seven major operations and had lost about 140 
pounds during an 18-month period. Maybe they didn't know why she lives in the 
RV. Maybe they didn't know that Fisher is almost always attached to an IV pump 
and that her intestinal contents are discharged in a plastic bag. In the RV, 
she can still get to the refrigerator or go to the bathroom unassisted. 
</P>
<P>
The RV is not only her home -- it is her world. 
</P>
<P>
The city had given Fisher notice that she had to find another home. 
</P>
<P>
After an article about Fisher's situation was published, the city granted her a 
three-month reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
I have periodically telephoned Fisher to inquire how she is and to find out 
whether she had received any word from the city. When I called last week, she 
had good news and bad. 
</P>
<P>
The city had granted her another six-month extension to live in her RV. And her 
relatives from across the country had also pooled $10,000 to move the RV out of 
the neighbors' sight. A contractor is making the renovations to accommodate the 
RV on the side of the house. 
</P>
<P>
But Fisher's doctors have told her that her kidneys and liver have been 
irreparably damaged and that she was living "minute to minute." 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the news, Fisher began taking care of business. The Christmas 
presents she purchased included deer statues for her cousin Jean Maxey -- a 
retired nurse who has been caring for her the last three years -- and a home 
spa unit for her 83-year-old grandmother, Mae, who suffers from a bad back. She 
also gave some of her belongings to a nurses' aide whose home was recently 
destroyed in a fire. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said the RV incident had mentally drained her but quickly added that she 
preferred to look on the brighter side. 
</P>
<P>
She referred to Caren Chatham-Heller, a San Juan Capistrano woman who offered 
her assistance after reading the newspaper article. 
</P>
<P>
"I was moved . . . and I was angry," Chatham-Heller said. "I know how 
uncommitted and uninvolved people are today, and I knew that the likelihood no 
one else would offer to help her was high." 
</P>
<P>
Chatham-Heller has since been in constant contact with Fisher. She has been 
helpful in finding an additional nurse's aide to care for Fisher at night. 
</P>
<P>
Although San Juan Capistrano's ordinance remains unchanged, in October, the 
Placentia City Council amended its law that prohibited people from living in 
recreation vehicles. Under the new law, the council may waive the requirements 
"because the city recognizes that at times a person cannot comply with this 
regulation due to extenuating circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Norman Z. Eckenrode, who proposed the amendment, said Fisher's story 
changed his mind about Placentia's land-use law. 
</P>
<P>
"We were moved by this woman's plight," Eckenrode said last week. "So we 
decided to tell our staff not to be hard-nosed about this. There are times when 
you have to have humanity or compassion and look the other way." 
</P>
<P>
I felt sad about Fisher's condition. But when I finally worked up the courage 
to ask her how she felt being so close to death, her answer made my sadness 
less painful. 
</P>
<P>
"If it wasn't my turn, I wouldn't be dying," she said. "He must have a reason 
for me still being here. It took a lot of hard fighting, and I have never given 
in. So if (my story) will help people in Placentia, then it was a good reason 
to be around."

A Midway City woman who was struck Friday night by a pickup truck as she tried 
to walk across a busy intersection has died, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Helen May Bowden Bender, 48, was crossing Bolsa Avenue at Purdy Street when the 
6:09 p.m. accident occurred, Westminster Police Sgt. Bob Amren said. 
</P>

Bender was in the crosswalk at the intersection, which has no signal or stop 
sign, Amren said, when the driver of a 1988 blue Chevy pickup failed to see 
her. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known how fast the truck was traveling when it struck her, Amren 
said.

STUDY FAVORS BARRIERS ON FREEWAY; 
</P>
<P>
SURVEY: RESULTS INDICATE THAT IT IS THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE ACCIDENTS INVOLVING 
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT PEDESTRIANS ALONG THE I-5 NEAR BORDER CHECKPOINT.

<P>
A Cal State Fullerton survey has concluded that the erection of high barriers 
along freeway medians is the best way to reduce the escalating numbers of 
accidents involving undocumented immigrant pedestrians along Interstate 5 in 
northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted at the behest of the California Department of 
Transportation, seems likely to add impetus to the controversial idea of 
constructing 10- to 12-foot median fences along the center divider of an 8-mile 
stretch of I-5 just south of the Orange County line. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of the so-called "I-5 Wall" has become an increasingly divisive one 
in the border area, pitting the law enforcement agencies that are pushing the 
concept against immigrant advocates who say it will do more harm than good, 
trapping frightened pedestrians against an impenetrable wall. 
</P>
<P>
Northbound undocumented immigrants seeking to avoid inspection at the U.S. 
Border Patrol checkpoint at San Onofre regularly traverse the freeway on foot, 
embarking upon an extremely hazardous trek around the inspection station. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, according to the California Highway Patrol, fast-moving vehicles on 
the freeway have struck 63 pedestrian immigrants in the area, killing 38 and 
injuring 25. There have been 22 casualties so far this year -- a new record for 
freeway carnage -- including 13 deaths and nine injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Cal State Fullerton, who are nearing the end of a yearlong, 
Caltrans-sponsored study of the issue, found that 71% of all respondents in 
their survey stated that such a barrier would be a "very effective" or 
"extremely effective" device. The remaining 29% said a median fence would be 
ineffective or only moderately useful. 
</P>
<P>
The survey results are expected to influence the decision-making process of 
Caltrans, which is now considering the erection of a fence in the freeway 
median. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll certainly pay attention to these findings in making our determination" 
on whether to construct the barriers, said Jesus M. Garcia, district director 
in San Diego for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
Survey respondents included more than 100 policy-makers, academics, immigrant 
advocates and others who have followed the evolving issue. 
</P>
<P>
Other tactics favored by those surveyed included a variety of less 
controversial approaches, such as the improvement of roadway lighting, the 
installation of signs alerting motorists and pedestrians to the danger, and the 
removal of roadside shrubbery that provides cover to pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
But the barrier concept, backed by the CHP and the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, remains the most provocative alternative. 
</P>
<P>
A decision on the barrier proposal is likely within weeks, said Garcia, who 
spoke at a meeting in San Diego where the survey findings were unveiled and 
discussed. A public hearing is possible but not definite before the decision is 
made, he said. Construction of such a barrier in northern San Diego County 
would probably take two years and cost about $1 million, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the barrier concept say such structures will reduce the 
likelihood of immigrants attempting to cross the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
But immigrant advocates and others contend that such structures could actually 
increase the carnage by trapping frightened pedestrians on the roadway median. 
A wall or fence will do little to discourage immigrants who have come this far, 
opponents argue. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Begnell, who is a battalion fire chief in San Clemente, said his agency 
feared that such a barrier could hamper life-saving efforts along the freeway 
by limiting emergency access to both sides of the freeway.

The flying angels of "The Glory of Christmas" were temporarily grounded 
Saturday when a transformer failed in the Crystal Cathedral, forcing the 
cancellation of an afternoon performance of the Christmas pageant and delaying 
two evening shows. 
</P>
<P>
Cathedral officials said the 1 p.m. outage resulted in chaos for the cast -- 
including an assorted menagerie -- and crew in the extravagant production, a 
$2-million retelling of the birth of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
"It was total panic," said Crystal Cathedral Manager Terry Larson. "We were 
trying to talk to people with tickets. . . . The crews were running around 
trying to fix it." 
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 people who had bought tickets to the 4:30 p.m. performance had to be 
turned away. The show was cancelled after a transformer that controls all of 
the theatrical lighting failed. Two later shows were delayed an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"We have four emergency generators, but they can't handle all of the theatrical 
lighting that goes on with the show," Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
The elaborate show includes a live menagerie of lambs, goats, sheep, horses, 
donkeys, an ox and a cow, plus eight angels suspended by wires to fly through 
the cathedral's expanse.

AVOIDING THE VIET SYNDROME: A NEW FALLACY;

ADVOCATES OF SUDDEN, MASSIVE FORCE CLAIM THE REASON FOR VIETNAM TRAUMA WAS THE

When Secretary of State James A. Baker III told Congress that any assault on 
Iraq would be carried out "suddenly, massively and decisively," he was issuing 
the Bush Administration's final verdict on the lessons of Vietnam. The United 
States does not intend to lose another war because the politicians forced the 
soldiers to fight with one hand tied behind their backs. 
</P>
<P>
Giving the generals what they want may, however, force the United States to 
"win" self-inflicted wars that need never have been fought at all, and whose 
ruinous human costs have not been spelled out to a fearful public. That is the 
danger in the gulf, and it is diminished only marginally by Saddam Hussein's 
decision to release his foreign hostages. That is good news, but it says 
nothing about his willingness to get out of Kuwait by Jan. 15. At the same 
time, it snaps one of the few thin emotional threads that has bound the U.S. 
public to President Bush's policy of brinkmanship.

Once Desert Shield was increased to 400,000 troops, with no prospect of 
rotation, the alarming logic of the new doctrine of massive force became 
apparent. Logistics began to drive policy. Conventional wisdom is that such a 
large force risks destabilizing Saudi Arabia; reducing the numbers would mean a 
loss of face; just being there may oblige them to fight -- and soon, before 
March 17, the start of Ramadan. (This parody of cultural sensitivity to Islam 
is perhaps the most ludicrous aspect of the whole affair. Has it really not 
occurred to Washington that the still-smoking rubble of an Arab nation, 
humiliated by the infidel, would transform the holy month into a time of 
anti-American rage and vengeance for millions of Muslims?) 
</P>
<P>
The fallacy of the new military doctrine is in the premise that the basic 
reason for public trauma over Vietnam was the way the war was fought, with a 
slow hemorrhaging of American lives. This implies that the problem can be 
addressed by a change in military strategy. This narrow reading ignores the 
larger lesson of Vietnam, which is that war is politically untenable if it 
lacks public support. Any war fought for dubious or ungraspable motives has the 
same potential for grief, alienation and division -- and this time public 
sympathy is already at levels it did not fall to in Vietnam until 1968. 
</P>
<P>
This time around, anti-war sentiment would not make the cruel mistake of 
blaming the soldiers and the veterans. In these four months of waiting, the 
troops in the desert have entered our living rooms with a greater electronic 
immediacy than their counterparts in Vietnam. Even if the Pentagon managed to 
keep the media away from front-line combat, we know these kids already -- those 
beardless pilots, straight out of "Top Gun," who speak of victory with all the 
nervous bravado of youth; that stolid Marine whose wife ended their satellite 
linkup on one breakfast TV show by wishing him "Semper Fi, babe." At least 
three out of 10 of the dead would be blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
And the manner and number of their deaths would be sickening. As a culture, we 
have devised many ways of concealing the realities of modern war. We strike 
bold postures, naming our aircraft Avenger and Apache, our missiles Hellfire 
and Patriot. In brisk bureaucratese, we speak of "smart weapons" and of 
"getting the job done." Official casualty predictions for a gulf war are 
classified, but the Pentagon has acknowledged that enough blood supplies are in 
place to treat 4,000 casualties a day. That's a much heavier casualty rate than 
at Iwo Jima. The most pessimistic defense analysts think 30,000 Americans could 
die in a single month of desert combat -- close to the battlefield toll of the 
entire Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
In this war, the dead might be the lucky ones. "Things are going to happen to 
people that we have never seen before," one weapons designer told the 
Minneapolis Star-Tribune. Field hospitals are good at digging out shrapnel and 
amputating limbs, but they have no clue how to deal with the arcane and 
nightmarish injuries that new hi-tech weaponry would inflict on armored vehicle 
crews in the desert: things like "blast lung" or "metal fume fever," the 
results -- often externally invisible -- of heat, light and shock waves and 
vaporized metal. Governments choose not to publicize this kind of information, 
writes weapons expert Donald Kennedy in the Army journal Armor, "for fear of 
its effects on their armed forces." 
</P>
<P>
In correcting the mistakes of the last war, military thinkers often set in 
motion the mistakes of the next one. And while the generals may have put the 
Vietnam Syndrome behind them, the Iraq Syndrome may be only just beginning.

<P>
POEMS OLD AND NEW BY DONALD HALL (TICKNOR &amp; FIELDS: $24.95, CLOTH; $12.95, 
PAPER; 244 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Gilbert, Gilbert is the author of Walks in the World: Representation 
and Experience in Modern American Poetry (Princeton University Press, 1991). He 
teaches American literature at Cornell University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reader looking for a reliable guide to the ebbs and flows of recent American 
poetry, its quicksilver shiftings of shape and sensibility, might do far worse 
than to consult Donald Hall's "Poems Old and New," a gathering of work spanning 
the years from 1947 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
More clearly perhaps than an anthology, in which general developments are 
refracted through the personal styles of many different poets, Hall's book 
charts the major watersheds that our poetry has crossed in the last 40 years as 
registered by a single artist. The fact that the most impressive poems come in 
the last 60 pages of the book says more about Hall's own special talents than 
about the progress of American poetry; the main styles of the last 15 years 
evidently have proven more congenial to his imagination than those of the 
previous 25. 
</P>
<P>
It must be noted that one reason Hall's poetry provides such a useful index to 
changes in period style is that Hall doesn't display a clearly recognizable 
style of his own. A poet of skill and intelligence, possessed of a particularly 
fine ear, Hall has been overshadowed by the more original poets of his 
remarkably rich generation, many of whom he has promoted as a reviewer and 
editor of anthologies. Poets such as Robert Bly, Louis Simpson, Galway Kinnell, 
W. D. Snodgrass and James Wright have been both friends of Hall and 
beneficiaries of his generous praise. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Hall permits his admiration to shade into imitation; a number of the 
poems in this book openly draw on the stylistic resources of Bly, Simpson, 
Kinnell and others. Inevitably, these poems fall short of their models, since 
style at second-hand tends to lose its original force, becoming mannered and 
unconvincing. 
</P>
<P>
Even when his poems can't be traced to the influence of a single figure, they 
seem to follow more general shifts in poetic fashions. Thus Hall moves from the 
hard, ironic, New Critical formalism of his early work to the open, "naked," 
quasi-surrealist mode that took hold in the '60s, from there pushing on to more 
extended narrative and descriptive forms in the '70s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
The very look of the poems changes dramatically as one thumbs through the 
volume, at first regimented into orderly stanzaic blocks in the '50s, suddenly 
dwindling in the '60s to irregular wisps of language, slowly fattening out in 
the '70s, finally returning in the '80s to what looks like the regular blocks 
of verse with which the book opens. Needless to say, these changes go much 
deeper as well, and the poems at the end of the book only superficially 
resemble those of the beginning; for one thing, they're much better. 
</P>
<P>
If Hall never entirely escapes the pressures of period style, such pressures 
can have salutary effects when combined with a strong personal disposition. In 
his more recent poetry, Hall has increasingly come into his own, finding forms 
and methods that serve his gifts better than either the constrictive wit of 
'50s formalism or the loose, associative Imagism of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in the mid-'70s, Hall's poems begin to expand, both in length and 
width; his line grows more capacious, his poems divide themselves into uneven 
sections, as if marking stages in a meditation; most important, they start to 
show a new attention to subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, Hall may have been swimming with the current; many poets in the '70s 
allowed themselves a new freedom to explore subjects, adopting some of the 
flexibility of prose to the contemplative aims of poetry. Be that as it may, 
Hall seems much more at ease in this style than he did with the short, 
image-based lyric of the '60s and early '70s. Hall's imagination is not 
metaphorical but meditative; he is better at connecting and weaving images and 
thoughts than he is at producing individual metaphors that startle us with 
their incongruity and rightness. His longer poems of the last 15 years are 
moving, elegiac meditations on the rhythms of natural process and the 
ubiquitous presence of death. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these recent poems are set on or near the New Hampshire farm where Hall 
has resided since leaving his academic post at the University of Michigan in 
1975. A number of them are Lawrentian animal poems, in which pigs, sheep, 
horses, cows and chickens take turns embodying the generational cycles of life 
and death. Others trace the history of the farm as it came down to Hall from 
his grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
What ties these poems together is a common concern with mortality and 
transience, the eternal counterpoint of what passes and what remains, or as 
Hall titles one poem, "Granite and Grass." At times, this theme is too baldly 
stated; death in the abstract may be too boring in its very terror to serve 
poetry's demands for intricacy and surprise. The farm poems are most engaging 
when they dwell on the sensuous reality of creature and landscape, without 
allegorizing them out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
To my mind, the best poems in the book come in its last two sections, 
containing work from the '80s. Here Hall moves in still another direction, 
pressing outward from the circle of his own history and geography to take in 
the experience and especially the suffering of others. There are some fine 
dramatic monologues that evoke the quiet dross of the quotidian as a backdrop 
for tragedies of aging and suicide; these poems combine the linguistic pressure 
of poetry with the circumstantial density of fiction. 
</P>
<P>
But Hall's most exciting work to date goes beyond the frame of the individual 
life altogether: In a number of recent poems here, and even more in his 1988 
long poem "The One Day" (which unfortunately is not excerpted in "Poems Old and 
New"), Hall experiments with a form that weaves together heterogenous strands 
of history, narrative, prophecy and description, producing a thickly textured 
tapestry with dissonant energies. 
</P>
<P>
In their ongoing tangle of details, these poems resemble linguistic fugues; 
motifs recur, are developed, fused with other motifs, and the effect is to 
capture some of the profusion and variety of life, even when the ground tone is 
death. Miniature versions of this form are "Six Naps in One Day" and "The 
Coffee Cup"; the most extended example, and the last poem of the book, is 
"Praise for Death." I can offer only a taste of this mode: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Everything 
</P>
<P>
 is strange, nothing is strange: 
</P>
<P>
 yarn, the moon, gray hair in a bun. 
</P>
<P>
New Hampshire, putting on socks. 
</P>
<P>
It does no disservice to Hall to say that none of the poems in this book are as 
good as the book-length "The One Day," which won the National Book Critics 
Circle Award. In its ambitious scope and dazzling complexity, that poem 
succeeds in rising above the changing tides of period style, touching a height 
at which decades become irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
If it does nothing else, "Poems Old and New" helps to make that achievement 
seem all the more impressive, by showing how long it took Hall to find a style 
that answered to his own imaginative needs and strengths.

A WAR WITHOUT A WINNING SIDE; 
</P>
<P>
PITY THE NATION; THE ABDUCTION OF LEBANON BY ROBERT FISK (ATHENEUM/MAXWELL 
MACMILLAN INTERNATIONAL: $24.95; 662 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Augustus Richard Norton, Norton's Amal and the Shi'a: Struggle for the Soul 
of Lebanon was published in 1987. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the world transfixed by the Gulf crisis, wretched and wrecked Lebanon is 
enjoying a small taste of peace. For the first time since 1975, Beirut's 
streets are empty of sectarian militias, and the central government -- with 
heavy Syrian support -- is finding its feet. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Fisk's timely book is a compendium of the calamities which have been 
inflicted upon the Lebanese by others, and by themselves. The book imparts a 
healthy skepticism about the future of Lebanon, where primordial loyalties run 
deep and half of the population is so young that it has no memory of a 
functioning central government. "Pity the nation divided into fragments," runs 
the Khalil Gibran poem, "each fragment deeming itself a nation." 
</P>
<P>
Fisk refers cynically to "The Plot," the characteristically Lebanese idea that 
every defeat reflects the complicity of outsiders, foreigners, externally 
directed agents provocateurs. The Lebanese chronically try to decipher the plot 
in order to explain minute events in terms of the designs of outside 
manipulators. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Lebanon is porous to manipulation and sometimes -- but not always -- 
a not-so-hidden hand can be found, pushing here, pulling there. Yet, violence 
in Lebanon often is its own explanation, the work of people working in a war 
system, where government is a fantasy and brute, ugly force takes the place of 
debate -- a system where base motives hide behind religious labels. "Pity the 
nation that is full of beliefs and empty of religion," Gibran's poem opens. 
</P>
<P>
Based in Beirut since 1976, initially for the Times of London, more recently 
for the Independent, Fisk has been a indefatigable chronicler of what the 
Lebanese euphemistically call "the events." Long after many observers came to 
view Lebanon as a hopeless case, Fisk hung on in West Beirut. He has witnessed 
Syria ascending, declining and rebounding, the rise and fall of the Palestinian 
Liberation Organization (PLO) statelet, two Israeli invasions and a humbling 
scramble to escape, as well as America's disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon stalked the Reagan administration, tearing at the fiber of its foreign 
policy and fomenting one crisis after another. The Israeli invasion of 1982, 
seized upon by President Reagan as a strategic opportunity, instead unchained a 
phalanx of disasters. The United States plunged its prestige and its Marines 
into the fray only to find that it had become merely one of the combatants. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy of America's involvement includes the decimation of the Marine 
barracks and the U.S. Embassy in 1983, the hasty "redeployment" of U.S. forces 
from Lebanon in 1984, the 1985 hijacking of a TWA plane and an epidemic of 
hostage-taking which continues to this day. The arms-for-hostages Iran-Contra 
affair was, of course, launched to win the freedom of Americans kidnaped in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
The American experience in Lebanon was hardly unique. Foreign armies never have 
stood much of a chance in Lebanon. Romans, Greeks, Assyrians, Egyptians, 
French, British and Israeli soldiers have come and gone, all much the worse for 
wear. One suspects that Syrian and Iranian soldiers will, eventually, face the 
same fate. Fisk's pungent observation is to the point: 
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon's revenge was to welcome all her invaders and then kiss them to death. 
The longer they stayed, the longer they needed to stay; and each day, every 
hour, their presence would be imperceptibly debased and perverted and 
poisoned." 
</P>
<P>
An Israeli colonel, a self-styled liberator of Lebanon, exclaims with joy "see 
how they welcome us . . . they have been waiting for us." Waiting, indeed. 
Tributes of rose water and rice intoxicate invading armies, and Lebanon's 
hospitality enraptures them. "Pity the nation that welcomes its new ruler with 
trumpetings, and farewells him with hootings, only to welcome another with 
trumpetings again." 
</P>
<P>
Israel's 1982 foray into Lebanon was a momentous blunder, and Fisk devotes 400 
pages to the invasion and its still continuing aftermath. Intended to remove 
the PLO as a political force and win a peace with Lebanon, Ariel Sharon's 
vainglorious scheme instead gave life to a formidable adversary, the Shiite 
militants who inflicted an impressive defeat upon the Israeli Defense Forces. 
By 1985, the IDF was forced to withdraw to an enclave in southern Lebanon, the 
self-declared "security zone," where, to this day, Israeli soldiers and proxy 
militiamen face regular attacks from Palestinian guerrillas and the Lebanese 
Shiites. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel's earlier wars, most serious reporting was done from the Israeli side 
of the battle lines. But, in 1982, with no government in Beirut capable of 
regulating their movements, reporters were free to see the war from the 
opposite direction. Fisk provides reliable, on-the-spot reportage from the war. 
</P>
<P>
Fisk's experience in Lebanon, where the charge of "terrorism" has proven a 
marvelous epithet with which to bludgeon one's enemies in the battle for world 
opinion, has taught him to be militantly critical of selective usage of the 
term. He argues that "To adopt the word means that we have taken a side in the 
Middle East, not between right and wrong, good and evil, David and Goliath, but 
with one set of combatants against another." 
</P>
<P>
As Israel tightened its stranglehold on Beirut in June and July of 1982, the 
PLO prepared for its Leningrad, arrogating to itself the right to sacrifice 
Lebanon's capital to its struggle. Fisk is no fan of the PLO. He is 
contemptuous of the PLO for its arrogance, its capacity for rationalizing 
defeat, its utter inefficiency and its callous disregard for the lives of 
civilians, but he is hardest on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The opening chapter is a moving account of Fisk's 1986 visit to 
Auschwitz-Birkenau, the most infamous extermination camp of the Holocaust. The 
author is trying to understand how a people who have suffered so dreadfully are 
able to rationalize the suffering they have inflicted subsequently upon others. 
He never resolves his dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
It is not that Israel is any worse than its enemies but that, in Fisk's view, 
it is simply no better. This is a lesson that he underlines with detailed, 
precise examples, ranging from the repeated bombings, in 1982, of hospitals; 
the wholesale targeting of civilians, and Israeli complicity in the truly sick 
massacres in the Sabra and Shatila camps. As Fisk concludes, "The Israelis 
acted brutally; they mistreated prisoners, killed thousands of civilians, lied 
about their activities and then watched their militia allies slaughter the 
occupants of a refugee camp. In fact, they behaved very much like the 
'uncivilised' Arab armies whom they had so consistently denigrated over the 
preceding 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
One of those armies laid waste to the Syrian city of Hama, in February of 1982, 
killing as many as 20,000 people. Fisk offers his eyewitness account from Hama, 
but it is only a snapshot, a glimpse of an awful massacre. Fisk's reporting on 
Syria usually has been tough, even foolhardy at times, given Syria's skewed 
attitudes toward freedom of the press, and he deserves credit for writing some 
courageous copy while living under the Syrian gun. It was his 1986 Times 
report, for instance, which provided details of Syrian complicity in the Rome 
and Vienna airport terrorist attacks in December, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Anderson, the Associated Press bureau chief who has suffered five years 
of imprisonment, is a colleague and friend of Fisk's. Fisk describes how the 
veteran volcanologists failed to read the rumbling and venting anger of the 
Shi'a; how they convinced themselves that they were safe from danger. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, Fisk surmises, paid too much attention to the affairs of the Shiites; 
he asked too many questions, and he was an American, in itself proof of all 
manner of skulduggery in the contorted minds of the extremists. Fisk writes 
lovingly about Anderson, but, perhaps understandably, he is holding a lot back 
from the reader. He is following the "unwritten laws" which all journalists in 
Lebanon understand. "In a land where there was no active police force, no law, 
no right of appeal, no claim to friendship or journalistic integrity that was 
sufficient to free our friend, what else could we do? Terry Anderson was the 
man who proved this, who paid the price for staying on the story." 
</P>
<P>
No one will read "Pity the Nation" without disagreeing with one or another of 
Fisk's conclusions. He is an argumentative writer with no qualms about picking 
fights with his readers. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, "Pity the Nation" is a remarkable chronicle of death and disorder 
in and around Lebanon, but it could have been a better book. It is too long, 
too redundant, and too much the master reporter's notebook. It is as though 
Fisk has cleaned out his drawers, dumping all of his notes in piles before the 
reader. Fisk's admirable ethic seems to be that it's not true unless he has 
seen it, but still, a little less of the intrepid reporter, driving at 
breakneck speed, chasing the brass ring -- the scoop -- would have been nice. A 
tighter, shorter, less self-indulgent book would have been more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Robert Fisk's greatest accomplishment is that he has survived all of 
his years in Beirut with his passion and his moral bearings intact. Fisk has 
made himself an ombudsman for the victims of violence in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
One finished "Pity the Nation" feeling pummelled emotionally by a ceaseless 
parade of maimed, broken, decomposing victims; people with names, faces, hopes, 
fear, and suffering pain, dreadful pain. Pity the victims.

POT CALLING THE BUDGET BLACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read Kenneth Adelman's review of "Blank Check: The Pentagon's Black Budget" 
by Tim Weiner (Oct. 7) and all I can say is you've got to be kidding. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Adelman to review a book about the Pentagon's secret spending? Kenneth 
Adelman, the super-hawk Reagan assistant secretary of Defense who did 
everything he could to fund the Pentagon's every wish? No wonder he dismisses 
the book in the first paragraph as an "excessive attack on the U.S. Security 
apparatus, especially during the Reagan years." 
</P>
<P>
What can we expect in The Times Book Review next? A "Defense of Puritan Values" 
reviewed by Gary Hart? Or perhaps "Consumerism: Are Americans Too 
Materialistic?" reviewed by Nancy Reagan? How about "Getting Tough on 
White-Collar Crime" reviewed by Charles Keating?

Poor Alex Ferguson, the letter-writer (Oct. 7) who bemoaned the loss of beauty 
and the loss of soul caused by his 2,000-year-old tradition's loss of 
exclusivity. I'd recognize him anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
He's the same man with the same "beauty" and the same "soul" who asks, "What 
about standards?" 
</P>
<P>
Excuse me for not being terribly moved by the tragedy of the loss of form, but 
I for one would rather hear from all those whose backs his precious tradition 
stood on in order to wave its banner -- and I'd rather hear it from them, the 
way they say it, not the way Mr. Ferguson prefers to hear it said in order to 
keep himself cozy. 
</P>
<P>
Standards? Yes. I think it's time we had some.

'THE CENTRAL MYSTERY'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In her review of Anne Rice's "The Witching Hour" (Nov. 18), Rita Mae Brown 
writes that "Renewal through destruction and regeneration through violence . . 
. is a concept repellent and alien to Christians, but something Hindus always 
have known." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt this will be news to Christians, for whom the torture, crucifixion, 
death and resurrection of Jesus form the central mystery of the faith and have 
done so for two millennia.

DR. KOOKIE, YOU'RE RIGHT! By Mike Royko (Plume: $8.95). This latest collection 
of Chicago Tribune columns confirms Mike Royko's position as one of the 
guardians of respectable American yahooism, a position he shares with Andy 
Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
There's something patently false about a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer posing 
as an everday Joe Sixpack who hangs out with his buddy, Slats Grobnik, but 
Royko plays the role to the hilt. He rails against anti-smoking crusaders, 
lawyers, yuppies (although he admits he lives like one), health food and 
feminism: "But even the most hard-nosed of feminists must concede that during 
the past two decades, great strides have been made. I know dozens of women who 
swear better than me." Royko's blue-collar persona allows him to vent otherwise 
unacceptable prejudices under the guise of just-one-of-the-boys goodfellowship.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: An Island on the Land By Carey McWilliams (Peregrine 
Smith: $9.95). Southern California has been perceived as a place apart since it 
was first explored by Europeans: Several attempts were made to divide 
California along the line of the Tehachapis, and the U.S. Congress probably 
would have approved the 1859 vote to partition the state if the Civil War 
hadn't intervened. 
</P>
<P>
Carey McWilliams' classic history traces the development of both the myth and 
reality of the region. The popular image of Southern California has always 
contained a large element of fantasy, beginning with the spurious picture of 
the jolly life in the days of the Old Missions that ignored the wholesale 
slaughter of the Indians. (In 1783, Governor Fages filed an official complaint 
about Father Junipero Serra's cruelty to his new Christian converts.) 
McWilliams devotes entertaining chapters to the cults, booms, busts and frauds 
that brought people and water to the once desolate Southern California 
chaparral. Although the text cries out for illustrations, McWilliams' book is 
ideal reading for anyone interested in how L.A. got to be what it is. Charles

This delightful anthology of characters used as logos by American businesses 
includes both the famous (Speedy Alka-Seltzer, Poppin' Fresh, The Jolly Green 
Giant) and the infamous, (the bizarre Chicken Boy who watches over downtown 
L.A.). The styles of the various characters suggest the changes in advertising 
graphics -- and taste -- that occurred over the decades: The original Aunt 
Jemima was an ugly black stereotype, who bears only scant resemblance to the 
pretty, lighter-skinned woman on modern packages. A treasure trove for 
illustrators and graphic designers. Charles Solomon

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As dusk falls and fog wraps halos around the street lamps, the curtain goes up 
on the theater of the street. 
</P>
<P>
A school bus disgorges two dozen Christian evangelists, who sing hymns and 
proselytize the homeless emerging from the shadows of Civic Center buildings. 
Two of the churchmen lash together a wooden, seven-foot-high cross and prop it 
on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
The worker bees who populate the headquarters buildings of Orange County 
government and Santa Ana City Hall scurry homeward, their places taken by 
squads of janitors. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Floyd, stage left. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd is homeless and alcoholic. He pushes an aluminum walker in front of him 
as he slowly hobbles along -- the legacy of two broken hips. 
</P>
<P>
A 58-year-old man who says that once he starts drinking "I'm off to the races," 
Floyd has shuffled from the bench he calls home, two long blocks away, to the 
meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous in a most unusual setting -- outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
For the past half year, ex-alcoholics -- most of whom are also former homeless 
people -- have been running outdoor AA meetings every Monday night in the Civic 
Center. For the past two months, there have also been Sunday afternoon meetings 
at Pioneer Park in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings are the work of Street People in Need, a private, nonprofit group 
organized in 1987 from parishioners at Our Lady Queen of Angels church in 
Newport Beach to feed the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
SPIN officials persuaded the owner of Sirius House, an Anaheim residence for 
recovering alcoholics, to start the AA street meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is far different from a church basement or a rescue mission office, 
typical sites for AA meetings. But then, "these people wouldn't come to a 
church basement," said Samuel W.H. Boyce, the Newport Beach advertising 
executive who started SPIN. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd certainly wouldn't make it there. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd says he took his last drink "a couple of weeks ago, maybe a little 
longer," and started going to the AA meetings around the same time. One night, 
"I was just walking by and I didn't even know there was a meeting going on 
until everyone says, 'That's an AA meeting.' " 
</P>
<P>
Floyd freely admits to being an alcoholic. A New Jersey native who is vague on 
dates and lengths of time, he says he was in the Navy for a while and in the 
Marines for a stretch, getting discharged from the air station at El Toro "in 
'66 or '67, somewhere in there." 
</P>
<P>
He worked briefly in a Costa Mesa factory after his discharge, though he can't 
remember what the factory produced. He lost the job "because I was drinking 
there too. I was bringing booze in my thermos bottle." 
</P>
<P>
After that, "I was always getting busted for (being) drunk in public," he says. 
During one of his stays behind bars, his wife made good on her threat to leave 
him. He figures that happened sometime in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't worked in about 20 years, he guesses, and spends part of his $663 
monthly disability payments to stay in a motel when he can. The disability 
payments, like the broken hips, are the legacy of being hit by a car while 
crossing a Santa Ana street, an accident that Floyd says kept him in a hospital 
for nearly a year, followed by a long stint in a convalescent home. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, as happened last month, he starts drinking in his motel room only to 
find upon awakening that someone who had been there sharing the bottle has made 
off with his money. Then it's back to the streets until the next check comes. 
</P>
<P>
It's men like Thomas who are trying to help men like Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
Until six months ago, Thomas (AA members request that their last names not be 
used) lived on these streets. Some nights were spent beneath railroad 
overpasses, others in whatever shelter might have room. 
</P>
<P>
He's 32 years old and says he was homeless almost continually from the time the 
Navy gave him a bad-conduct discharge about six years ago for selling drugs 
until he got into Sirius House. 
</P>
<P>
Addicted to alcohol and drugs, clean since May, Thomas was headed back to jail 
for violating probation after being convicted of felonious assault and drug 
sales. Boyce and SPIN stepped in, agreeing to a judge's suggestion that they 
take charge of him and try to straighten him out. 
</P>
<P>
Boyce "saw something in me," Thomas says. He "told me about these services. I 
didn't pay any attention the first couple of times . . . (but) there finally 
came a time when I could face five years in prison or straighten my life out." 
</P>
<P>
Then too, "my girlfriend died in May, from the drugs. And that kind of got my 
attention, too. It was a dead-end street." 
</P>
<P>
As he gets ready to speak, Thomas says he remembers most of his listeners from 
the days he was living on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just as glad to see them as they are to see me," he says. "I see them and 
it reminds me of where I came from and what I don't want to return to. They see 
me and they see the hope" they can get better. "All it takes is a willingness. 
There's no magic formula to it." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas is one of 25 people who have entered recovery homes through these street 
gatherings since June, according to Boyce. 
</P>
<P>
If a homeless alcoholic tells one of the AA members at the meeting that he 
wants to get sober, he gets taken to a detoxification center for a stay of 
about a week. SPIN then pays for the alcoholic's room and board in a recovery 
home for up to a month or until he finds a job. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Shaw, who directs SPIN's substance abuse rehabilitation program, said the 
organization is just about ready to help recovery home residents who have been 
sober for eight or nine months to move into apartments of their own. 
</P>
<P>
As it does with homeless families, SPIN would extend no-interest loans to help 
the ex-alcoholics pay the several months' rent and security deposit usually 
needed to rent an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"That's our long-term goal for these people," Shaw said. The meetings, 
detoxification, recovery house and apartment rental are the opposite of a "type 
of program that's a quick, 'three hots and a cot' kind of thing. It's a real 
long-term, meeting-the-problem-at-its-source kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dear, a USC geography professor who has studied the homeless, said he 
was unaware of any other AA street meetings. He said surveys across the 
country, including one he conducted last year on Los Angeles' Skid Row, found 
that about one-third of the homeless have problems with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Don, who runs some of the meetings -- beginning with the traditional "My name 
is Don and I'm an alcoholic" and the response from the crowd, "Hi, Don" -- 
tells of earning $70,000 in 1984 and $7,000 in 1988. Alcoholic and an 
occasional drug user, he lost his wife and stepson, his job and his house 
before discovering AA. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is like most others, except for the setting. Several people, 
including Thomas, "share" their tales of misery and degradation before becoming 
sober. Two dozen or so homeless people stand nearby or sit on hard, wooden 
benches to listen to the stories, sip the coffee provided by SPIN, puff on 
cigarettes doled out one at a time by Don. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, interlopers make a beeline for the coffee and the doughnuts. 
Quietly, Don or another member firmly pulls them aside, explains it's an AA 
meeting and not a food giveaway, and invites them to stay and listen. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Neely, founder of the Homeless Outreach Program on Los Angeles' Skid Row, 
said that holding AA meetings on the street where the homeless congregate is "a 
very workable kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is the message, and not necessarily the locations," 
said Neely, who is an ex-alcoholic and ex-drug addict. "And for homeless people 
it's very important for things to be accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"Support groups are the buzzwords of the '90s," Neely said, "and the thing that 
upper middle-class and middle-class people have the advantage of is getting to 
these support groups." But the down-and-outers have the hardest times finding 
such groups, Neely said, and when there is a program like SPIN's, "I applaud 
that kind of effort." 
</P>
<P>
Neely said a group known as the Drifters has been conducting AA meetings on 
Skid Row for nearly 20 years, though their sessions are held indoors, currently 
at the 6th Street offices of Neely's organization. 
</P>
<P>
Bill, who organizes the Drifters' meetings, said 40 to 50 people normally 
attend, and the majority are homeless. Not all are AA members, he said. Many 
"come primarily for the coffee and the cigarettes at this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd could identify with those people. Although he says he's an alcoholic and 
has been attending these meetings for a while, he's not taking part in the 
program AA preaches. He doesn't stand up and proclaim, "I'm an alcoholic," he 
doesn't take his turn reading from the AA-published book by the light of a 
portable lantern. 
</P>
<P>
He listens quietly to the speeches at the Santa Ana AA street meeting, takes a 
doughnut or two, some coffee and a cigarette if he gets there before they're 
all gone, then drifts on up the street to wait for a later event: the weekly 
feeding of the homeless by a church group.

It was a supermarket manager's nightmare. Customers filled the aisles, pinching 
produce, comparing labels on cake mixes, thumbing through coupons. But they 
weren't buying. 
</P>
<P>
Surveying the scene, Mark Rollings took the problem in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody shop!" barked Mark, 8, his fingers poised over the cash register 
keys. In a moment, baskets were filled and shoppers scurried to the checkout 
stand. Rollings greeted his first customer with a smile, weighed each item and 
calculated the total. 
</P>
<P>
He announced, "$5.54," then, "Oh, yeah. Come again." 
</P>
<P>
Eat your heart out, Joe Albertson. 
</P>
<P>
"When I Grow Up," an interactive exhibit at the Children's Museum at La Habra, 
has given Rollings and thousands of other gradeschoolers some playful 
"on-the-job" career training in everything from supermarket checking to data 
entry to brain surgery. In a dozen fully outfitted learning areas, waitress 
wanna-bes can hustle burgers at a mock restaurant while pint-size doctors and 
dentists "operate" on giggling patients. The exhibit, which continues through 
Jan. 5, is recommended for ages 4 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
As with most of the museum's exhibits, local businesses have contributed to 
"When I Grow Up" by lending equipment, clothing and other props, and by 
providing basic information on their businesses to museum docents. 
</P>
<P>
Docents and gallery aides then translate the facts into children's terms during 
gallery tours. To create a mini-veterinarian's office, for example, Dr. Richard 
Glassberg provided an examining table, cages, anatomy charts and X-rays (along 
with a few dogeared copies of Today's Animal Health). 
</P>
<P>
The Sizzler Restaurant chain loaned menu boards and uniforms, and interior 
designer Francois Thibeault created a designer's corner, complete with fabric 
swatches, color charts and window coverings. Museum staff members rounded out 
the show with a costume rack bearing everything from surgical scrubs to 
construction workers' reflective vests and a mock supermarket stocked with 
empty dry-good containers, plastic produce and shopping baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a break from their "jobs," Mark Rollings and his classmates at 
Fullerton's Richman Elementary School offered various opinions on the world of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"A job is something you do to earn money to pay for your house and to buy 
groceries . . . at other stores," Mark said. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of Sergio Ojebe, 9, who aspires to be a "guy who makes drawings 
that they use in the newspaper," a career is "something that happens to you 
when you get big and don't have to go to school anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Sergio got a head start on his vocational training by spending his visit 
hunched over a drafting table with a ruler. 
</P>
<P>
According to gallery assistant Pauline Hanson, "When I Grow Up" was designed to 
"give children a better idea of the tools they might work with in various 
professions." Office machines such as the typewriter, adding machine and the 
functioning computer and cash register -- anything with keys that could be 
punched, mashed or monkeyed with in any way -- are among the most popular items 
in the display. 
</P>
<P>
And, Hanson said, the hands-on experience also gives children a "better concept 
of the importance of working together on the job. And that's a lesson they can 
put to use right now." 
</P>
<P>
Decked out in lab coats and equipped with a stethoscope and tweezers, "doctors" 
Yah Asari, 9, and Khang Nguyen, 9, proved that cooperation does not have to 
mean conformity. Discussing their recent "surgery" on Phavanna Sundara, 9, they 
had conflicting diagnoses. 
</P>
<P>
"She had something bad in her stomach, so we had to take it out," Yah decided. 
</P>
<P>
"No way," Khang countered. "Her heart wasn't bumping, so we fixed it." 
</P>
<P>
"When I Grow Up" is one of four displays to be offered over the next year by 
the 14-year-old museum. Upcoming exhibits include "Body Wonder-full," an 
exploration of anatomy and health from a child's perspective presented by the 
Sacramento Science Center from Jan. 21 through April 20, 1991; the "Children's 
Art Festival," a series of non-competitive children's art displays and 
workshops running May 6 through June 8, and "Kids in Touch," an examination of 
the many types of communication, which runs June 24 through Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The recently expanded 12,500-square-foot facility also offers a toddlers' room 
with play structures and toys for the under-5 crowd, a nature walk with 50 
taxidermied animals and the Kids on Stage room, with costumes, set pieces and 
other theatrical equipment.

RELATIVES LEARN TO COPE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The elderly Hollywood man was talking about Thanksgiving at a recent workshop 
on helping families cope with Alzheimer's disease during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"The holidays are great," said the man, 80, who takes care of his 
Alzheimer's-afflicted wife of 51 years. Holidays are not only good for the 
person with the disease, he said, "it's also good for the care-giver because it 
gives them a chance to relax with other people." 
</P>
<P>
The man smiled. And then he burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
The holidays are often hellish for families dealing with Alzheimer's and other 
conditions that produce dementia or loss of cognitive abilities. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood man, for instance, was uncertain whether he and his spouse would 
be able to join their son in San Diego for Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
His wife has been suffering from a bladder infection recently, and her 
progressive brain disorder is constantly producing new deficits and 
complications. Since she became ill, the woman is anxious whenever she travels. 
Her husband worried that the unfamiliar pounding of the wheels of the train 
would unnerve her. 
</P>
<P>
It is almost too much to bear, especially alone, the man made clear. When you 
have Alzheimer's in the family, he said before his tears drove him from the 
room in embarrassment, "everybody walks away." 
</P>
<P>
At a recent workshop in Century City, the Los Angeles chapter of the 
Alzheimer's Assn. and the Westside Consortium of Senior Services offered 
Alzheimer's care-givers practical advice and the bitter solace of knowing that 
others are suffering, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The holidays are often a very joyful time, but they can also be very, very 
difficult," said Lynn Morishita, program director for the Center for Geriatric 
Health at Century City Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The grown-up children of people with Alzheimer's routinely feel cheated, the 
experts said. The children gather around the table, remembering when Mom or Dad 
successfully stage-managed beloved holiday traditions, and they see only loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Holidays carry a lot of emotional wallop," said Nina Luce, a Santa Monica 
marriage and family counselor who specializes in geriatric issues. "We remember 
how it was, and if we don't get it, we're crushed."

Holidays often precipitate a crisis among siblings, the speakers pointed out. 
Family members who live elsewhere often come home for the holidays only to 
discover that a parent or grandparent is much worse than they had realized from 
long-distance phone calls. Brothers and sisters sometimes blame the sibling who 
does most of the care-giving, who in turn typically feels overburdened. 
</P>
<P>
The experts agreed that a good first step in dealing with Alzheimer's is to 
have a family consultation with a caseworker or someone else with expertise in 
dementia and the medical, emotional and legal problems it creates. The earlier 
the family begins to think about these issues, the better, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The experts also recommended that the family arrange to have the affected 
individual evaluated at a good geriatric health center. Some of the 
deficiencies associated with Alzheimer's are treatable, they said. For example, 
better diet may help a little. "A lot of older people are living on toast and 
tea," Luce pointed out. A complete evaluation will not only reveal what's wrong 
with the affected person, but also help the family take full advantage of those 
abilities that remain, Morishita said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the holidays are so difficult is that they underscore the role 
reversal that is one of the most painful aspects of dealing with dementia.

CERRITOS CITY COUNCIL BANS FIREWORKS

<P>
Heeding the wishes of its citizenry, the City Council voted last week to ban 
the sale and use of Fourth of July fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, voters overwhelmingly decided that they did not want their city to 
allow fireworks. The referendum, which was put on the ballot by the City 
Council, was non-binding, but council members pledged they would abide by the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 0 Wednesday for the ban. Councilman Daniel Wong was 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
Several church, civic and youth groups that sold fireworks each year in order 
to raise money had fought the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'll see a lot of the clubs disbanding," said Dennis Peterson, 
immediate past president of the Cerritos Rod and Gun Club, which sponsors the 
city's annual youth fishing derby. 
</P>
<P>
Without the income from fireworks sales, Peterson said, the club may not be 
able to continue the derby. Fireworks sales, Peterson said, produced more money 
for the club than such activities as selling pumpkins or Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
Bryna Dambrowski of the Assembly of God Church said two church groups that sold 
fireworks have not yet decided how they will sustain themselves in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Rangers, an organization for boys ages 5 to 17, used its fireworks 
profits to underwrite camping trips or excursions to such places as Magic 
Mountain amusement park, Dambrowski said. 
</P>
<P>
The church's teen youth group used fireworks money to go on missions, either to 
Third World countries or to places in the United States, such as New York City, 
where it worked last summer with poor, inner-city youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is not unmindful of what the fireworks ban means to nonprofit 
groups. At the council meeting Wednesday night, Mayor Ann B. Joynt asked the 
city staff to explore the possibility of allowing nonprofit groups to take over 
a job now being done by professionals -- painting house addresses on curbsides. 
</P>
<P>
Dambrowski, who was not at the meeting, said her church groups might consider 
such a fund-raising activity, but Peterson was more skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
He said it might be more difficult to find enough volunteers to paint the 
street numbers than to staff a fireworks sales booth, which could only be 
operated seven days before the Fourth of July.

CABRILLO BEACH WILL BE WIDENED; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE SAN PEDRO BEACH WILL BE BUILT UP WITH SAND EXCAVATED DURING 
CONSTRUCTION AT THE HYPERION SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The outer portion of Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro, devastated by more than 25 
years of ocean currents and winter storms, will be widened by about 250 feet 
thanks to construction at a sewage treatment plant nearly 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 cubic yards of sand will be excavated next fall near the city 
of Los Angeles' Hyperion treatment plant in Playa del Rey and hauled by truck 
to San Pedro, under a plan approved by city recreation and parks officials on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal needs several other local, state and federal approvals, all of 
which are expected by the end of January. Officials from the city, county and 
Army Corps of Engineers have been working on the proposal since August, 1989, 
when it was suggested by Harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores. 
</P>
<P>
The excavation project at Hyperion is part of a multibillion-dollar effort to 
improve the city's sewage treatment system. The sand must be moved to make way 
for a series of concrete settling tanks that will be used in the final stages 
of sewage treatment. 
</P>
<P>
About 750,000 cubic yards of sand were removed from the site nearly three years 
ago and deposited on Dockweiler and El Segundo beaches, both of which suffer 
similar erosion problems. The sand for all of the projects comes from a 
previously undeveloped knoll just south of the treatment plant on Vista del Mar 
and has been tested for impurities. 
</P>
<P>
"The beach at Cabrillo is disappearing," said Dale Hall, a planner with the 
county Department of Beaches and Harbors, which operates Cabrillo Beach for the 
city of Los Angeles. "The choice was to take the sand from Hyperion and dump it 
somewhere, or put it on the beach. This works to everyone's advantage." 
</P>
<P>
The Army Corps of Engineers, which has jurisdiction over the federal breakwater 
abutting Cabrillo Beach, warned in 1987 that the massive wall separating Los 
Angeles Harbor from the Pacific could be damaged if erosion at Cabrillo Beach 
continues unchecked. The corps estimated at that time that the outer beach, 
which buffers the rocky breakwater from the ocean's waves, loses 10,000 cubic 
yards of sand each year. 
</P>
<P>
County officials concurred that a breach in the breakwater was "a distinct 
possibility" and said winter storms pose a particular threat to a parking lot 
and road along the breakwater. County officials estimate that winter storms in 
1984 and 1985 caused $25,000 in damage to the lot, which had received a 
$900,000 overhaul after severe winter storms in 1983. The county spent an 
additional $240,000 on the lot after storms in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The man-made beach has been locked in a constant struggle with the sea since it 
was built in 1927. Unlike the inner portion of Cabrillo Beach, which is located 
inside the breakwater, the outer beach doubles as a recreation area and a 
fortress, protecting both the breakwater and the harbor behind it. 
</P>
<P>
The beach, which attracted 1.6 million visitors last year, extends 3,000 feet 
along the outside breakwater from cliffs near Point Fermin. It has no natural 
source of sand supply and was last replenished in the early 1960s with 1.2 
million cubic yards of material dredged from the Los Angeles and Long Beach 
harbors. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the beach was about 250 feet wide, but 25 years of waves and 
storms have whittled away tons of sand, leaving some areas less than 50 feet 
wide. 
</P>
<P>
The replenishment project is expected initially to widen the beach by about 300 
feet and add about 10 acres in surface area. After the sand settles and reaches 
what officials call "an equilibrium condition," the beach is expected to be 
about 250 feet wider and 6.8 acres larger. About 40,000 cubic yards of sand 
will be deposited in a back-shore dune to provide additional protection against 
waves and to act as a reserve for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
The hauling of the sand from Playa del Rey to San Pedro -- expected to take 
three to five months -- was originally scheduled to begin next April, but 
delays at Hyperion and concerns about the spawning of grunion have pushed the 
start date into September or October. Tentative plans call for the creation of 
an offshore berm with the first loads of sand to create a temporary beach for 
the grunion, which slither out of the water every spring and summer to lay 
their eggs in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists at the Cabrillo Marine Museum and officials from the state 
Department of Fish and Game are collecting data on grunion spawning at Cabrillo 
Beach, which will be used to devise a final plan for distributing the sand, 
officials said. An environmental report prepared by the county concludes that 
it will be "impossible to avoid impacts on grunion spawning entirely," but 
states the grunion will ultimately benefit from the wider beach. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles will pay for the replenishment project, with most of 
the money coming from the Hyperion construction account. Allan Kawaguchi, an 
engineer for Hyperion, said officials there agreed to pay a contractor to haul 
the sand to San Pedro since they would have had to haul it to a landfill 
anyway. Once the sand is at the beach, the city's Department of Recreation and 
Parks will spread it, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had no cost estimate for the project, but they described the 
arrangement as a bargain. The final cost, they said, will depend in large part 
upon bids received for hauling the sand. In 1987, the Army Corps of Engineers 
estimated that it would cost $1.9 million to replenish the beach with sand 
dredged offshore. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have cost us a lot more to go out and buy the sand and bring it in," 
said Julie Mantrom, an aide to Flores. "By taking advantage of this unusual 
opportunity, we will be saving a lot of money."
