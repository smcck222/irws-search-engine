Lyndon Johnson may have had a credibility gap, but considering that his 
rationale for the ever-increasing U.S. military buildup in the Mideast seems to 
change from day to day, George Bush is rapidly developing a credibility gulf!

Lindsay's age and physical condition are but manifestation of human frailty. He

<P>
This is a tribute to Gil Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
When various humane organizations in 1969 urged the Los Angeles City Council to 
establish a public spay and neuter clinic, Gil Lindsay was the outstanding city 
councilman who led us to victory. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, we now have three spay and neuter clinics in Los Angeles, together 
with four in the county. Millions of dollars have been saved by the public and 
countless animals lives which would be destroyed by our city and county 
shelters at considerable public expense have been prevented. 
</P>
<P>
We are saddened by Councilman Lindsay's condition and fervently hope for his 
recovery.

NORMAN COUSINS' ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirteen years ago, I was asked to care for a patient with advanced lung cancer 
for whom all available therapies had been tried and had failed. The patient was 
understandably despondent. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins had just published his article, "Anatomy of an Illness as Perceived by 
the Patient," and though I had neither met nor spoken to him before, I called 
and asked if he would offer my patient some encouragement. He explained that he 
was leaving for China the following day, at the request of then-President 
Carter, but volunteered to postpone his packing and come to the hospital 
immediately to visit the patient. He visited for close to two hours. During the 
next week, he called the patient every day until he arrived in China, from 
where he said regular calls would be difficult to place. He called again as 
soon as he left China, and visited the patient again. 
</P>
<P>
During the past 13 years, Norman was always available to meet with patients in 
this manner. He had earned a kind of celebrity status in medical matters as a 
result of his widely read books on his own illnesses and recovery, yet he 
retained the same personal concern for others that he had shown in our first 
contact. He spent his time graciously. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before his death he attended a luncheon to help launch a nonprofit, 
computer-based information resource for the nation. He was constantly looking 
for ways in which he could improve our lives. 
</P>
<P>
I stand in awe of his accomplishments, and I will miss him.

LOCKER ROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Foul Play" (Nov. 29) fails to address the real problem of 
female or male reporters in locker rooms -- the insufferable stupidity of both 
questions and answers. 
</P>
<P>
I think we all would grant that, yes, had the losing team 
caught/carried/defended with greater zeal and alacrity, the outcome would have 
been different. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the winning team usually allows that, yes, it was in top form, 
out-hustling, out-catching and outrunning its opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Of course it did. Which is why the game is over, and there is a winner and a 
loser. But do we really need more of these "interviews," dominated by the 
phrase "y'know," uttered by the marginally articulate? Did anyone ever learn 
anything from these confrontations? 
</P>
<P>
Viewers would be better served if all reporters were absent from the locker 
room. Let the athletes shower and dress, then answer urgent inquiries in the 
proper setting. By then, most intelligent fans will have gone on to more 
stimulating pastimes.

ANTI-SEMITISM IN POLAND

Piotr Pacewicz writes in "The 'Other Poland' Votes for a Miracle" (Opinion, 
Dec. 2) that Polish television "gave equal free time for all candidates' 
campaigns." Imagine what would have happened here in the United States November 
if we had such a democracy! In our "free elections" the media are available 
only to those candidates with enough money to buy them.

ANTI-SEMITISM IN POLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It comes in waves. The press carries articles about the horror of demonic 
anti-Jewish sentiment in Poland (Lipstadt's column). 
</P>
<P>
One should ask the author to be more factual and not use trifocal glasses to 
produce a distorted vision of Polish history. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Semitic graffiti are not alien to American society, as well as some 
anti-Semitic acts, occasionally violent in their expression. The same can be 
said about prejudice against other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Those acts, however infrequent, do exist and no Draconian measures can 
extirpate them from our social organism. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to Poland and Poles, every sporadic incident becomes 
grotesquely magnified and generalized upon the entire Polish society. How much 
derogatory graffiti did the author see in Poland? Sporadic acts are used for 
spilling the stain of anti-Semitism on everybody around. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that Polish-Jewish relations in this century suffered a bad fate. 
Was it because one side -- Poles -- caused it? Lipstadt reaches to the New 
Testament, but omits the more recent history of the Polish-Jewish tragedy. 
Communism was forced on Poland with significant participation by Polish Jews. 
The terror followed. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, we should remember the small number of Nazi collaborators who 
betrayed Jews and Polish patriots to Nazis, but overall we should emphasize the 
much larger group of rescuers, those who survived their heroic acts as well as 
those forgotten by their demise.

WEST BANK LINK IS TO POLAND; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: IT'S NOT KUWAIT BUT THE FATE OF FORMER GERMAN TERRITORIES THAT PROVIDES 
A MEANINGFUL PARALLEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By ALEXANDER M. SCHINDLER, Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler is president of the 
Union of American Hebrew Congregations, central body of Reform Judaism in the 
United States and Canada.

<TEXT>
<P>
The circumstances surrounding Iraq's unprovoked aggression against Kuwait and 
Israel's capture of the West Bank and Gaza in a defensive war are so different 
that any "linkage" between the two can hardly be argued. 
</P>
<P>
A parallel does exist elsewhere on the globe to Israel's occupation of the West 
Bank and Gaza, but it is one that is not likely to offer much consolation to 
the Arab world. The territory in question, acquired (as the West Bank and Gaza 
were) in a war, consists of most of the pre-World War II Prussian provinces of 
Upper and Lower Silesia, including all of the territory east of the Oder and 
Niesse rivers. They are now firmly -- and, one hopes permanently -- in Polish 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's right to that territory -- one-third of the nation's land, including 
the cities of Wroclaw (formerly Breslau) and Poznan (formerly Posen) -- was 
formalized in the treaty signed by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Polish 
government on the eve of German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Israel came into possession of the West Bank in repelling aggression by 
Jordan in 1967 (after begging King Hussein not to invade), so did Poland 
acquire former German territories that it has held since Hitler lost them to 
advancing Soviet forces in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's right to hold on to the West Bank appears, in fact, to be legally 
stronger than Poland's claim to the former German territories it now holds. 
Both Upper and Lower Silesia were Prussian provinces, an integral part of the 
Third Reich. But no one had established a lawful claim to the West Bank and 
Gaza. The 1949 truce that ended Israel's war of independence established 
borders that reflected only military reality -- the lines were drawn where the 
fighting stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) were in Jordanian hands and from 1949 to 
1967, Jordan was the occupying power; only two countries (Britain and Pakistan) 
recognized Jordan's claim to sovereignty. There was no Palestinian nationalist 
movement (and no intifada) to claim the territory for "Palestine." 
</P>
<P>
This is not to suggest that Israel keep all of the territories it won in 1967. 
For its own sake, and to rid itself of the burden of ruling over a hostile 
population, Israel should work out some way of relinquishing territory 
consistent with its security. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, given the apparent loyalty of most Palestinian Arabs to the PLO, 
the PLO's propensity for violence and the legitimate doubts that have been 
raised about the PLO's willingness to live in peace with Israel, I am not at 
all sure that a deal is possible. Nevertheless, Israel must make the effort -- 
for the sake of peace and for the sake of a tomorrow free of the rancor, 
bitterness and hatred on both sides.

EDWARD BINNS, 74; ACTOR PLAYED TOUGH-GUY ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edward Binns, a sturdy, gravel-voiced character actor who portrayed police, 
spies and an assortment of other tough guys in a career that ranged from 
classical drama to episodic television, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
Binns died Tuesday of a heart attack at his home in Warren, Conn., his wife, 
actress Elizabeth Franz, told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Binns, also known professionally as Ed Binns, was 74. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Philadelphia, he graduated from Pennsylvania State University before 
beginning a dramatic career. In 1947, he portrayed an Army officer in "Command 
Decision" on Broadway 
</P>
<P>
He moved to television in the early 1950s as one of the tough police officers 
in the early anthology "Police Story." The series, unrelated to the series of 
the same name of the 1970s written by Joseph Wambaugh, was based on actual 
cases. Actors were chosen who physically resembled the police officers 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, Binns was chosen to star in "Brenner," another police drama filmed in 
New York City in which two generations of police officers learned from and 
fought with each other. Binns as the father was the hardened career officer, 
and his son, played by James Broderick, was the rookie. The shows continued in 
syndication through 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Others of Binns' hundreds of television credits included sustaining roles in 
"It Takes a Thief" (as spy agent Wallie Powers) and "The Nurses" (as Dr. Anson 
Kiley.) 
</P>
<P>
In films he normally was seen as ordinary, working-class characters, epitomized 
best by his work in "Twelve Angry Men," the 1957 picture made of Reginald 
Rose's drama about a lone holdout among jurors debating a murder verdict. 
</P>
<P>
His other pictures included "Teresa," "Compulsion," "North by Northwest," 
"Patton" and "The Verdict."

DEBT-RIDDEN RICHMOND DISTRICT OUSTS SCHOOLS SUPERINTENDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
RICHMOND, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of rumors, the Richmond school board has ousted Supt. Walter Marks 
amid concern that he was jeopardizing the district's chances of getting a 
second emergency bailout loan from the state. 
</P>
<P>
Marks was hired three years ago to make changes but is leaving the district in 
financial chaos. The district, which had a $141.5-million budget this year, 
could run out of money by next February, one state legislator said. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which faces an estimated $25-million shortfall for next year, 
received a $9-million loan from the state earlier this year and is forced to 
ask for an additional $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The consensus of opinion was that if we were going to have a good shot of 
seeing this loan, Marks would have to go," said Assemblyman Robert J. Campbell 
(D-Richmond), who called the district "the worst example of a public agency not 
being run well." 
</P>
<P>
Marks will leave Dec. 31 and will be paid $93,989 to buy out the remainder of 
his four-year contract. His salary was $112,566 a year to oversee the 
30,000-student district. 
</P>
<P>
"When push came to shove, somebody had to go and it's me because I wanted it to 
be," Marks said. "I've wanted it for a long time. I've done all I can do -- 
both good and bad." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Stewart, a state trustee who has been overseeing the district since the 
governor approved the first loan last summer, said it will take "a miracle" to 
save the 48-school Richmond Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"The district is in a very deep hole, and it's going to take the combination of 
a lot of support from a lot of people before this problem is solved," he said. 
"I have never seen a district in such financial condition." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said the board blamed the controversial superintendent for introducing 
innovative programs without considering how to pay for them.

TRAGEDY BRINGS SAMOANS TOGETHER; 
</P>
<P>
RACE RELATIONS: SLAYING OF GIRL MAY BE THE SHOCK THAT SPELLS AN END TO THE 
LONG-STANDING ISOLATION OF OCEANSIDE'S COMMUNITY OF SOME 5,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wayward bullet and the death of a teen-age girl have snapped Oceanside's 
large Samoan community out of half a century of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Most Samoans live close together in modest neighborhoods outside Camp 
Pendleton's back gate, where they mainly have kept to themselves while elders 
sternly coped with a younger generation that eagerly adopted American ways. 
</P>
<P>
But suddenly, the leaders of the city's estimated 5,000 Samoans are striving to 
see their people enter the political and economic mainstream and struggling to 
heal the deep generational wounds among many Samoan families. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for change was spurred by the Oct. 1 shooting death of 14-year-old 
Michele Tate, a popular black girl allegedly slain by a Samoan youth as she and 
friends left a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"A bullet found a body and the leaders of the Samoan and black communities have 
to answer because of the outrage," said Wayne Godinet, a Samoan and director of 
the local Boys and Girls Club. "It took that incident to pull us together." 
</P>
<P>
Two months after Tate's death, Samoan leaders have strengthened relations with 
Oceanside's black community, and met frequently to take stock of the Samoan 
community. 
</P>
<P>
They're creating a special 15-member Samoan council to include ministers, local 
Samoan chiefs, other leaders and youth representatives to set still-hazy 
political, economic and cultural goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to live in a world of isolation, a cocoon," said the Rev. Uatisone 
Afaese, the Samoan-born minister of the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Vista, 
which has 150 Samoan members. 
</P>
<P>
That isolationism is beginning to end, perhaps ironically so. 
</P>
<P>
The call for progress was spurred because police initially suspected that Tate 
was slain by violence between rival black and Samoan youth gangs, and ethnic 
leaders mobilized in fear of further gang bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
However, authorities later concluded the shooting wasn't gang related at all, 
and now believe that Akeli S. Kelly, a 21-year-old Samoan, had fired a rifle at 
a personal enemy standing near Tate, and the poorly-aimed shot killed her 
instead. Kelly awaits trial for murder. 
</P>
<P>
Relieved the shooting was not part of a gang war, Samoan leaders regard the 
incident as a tragedy they hope it will inspire a new era of progress. 
</P>
<P>
They are starting from scratch, unsure even of their own numbers. 
</P>
<P>
With 1990 Census figures not being released until next year, Samoans rely on 
guesswork to fix their Oceanside population. 
</P>
<P>
Salefitu Siva of the Office of Samoan Affairs in San Diego puts the figure at 
between 4,000 and 5,000, giving Oceanside the largest Samoan community in San 
Diego County, which has about 10,000 Samoans. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Islanders began arriving here through Camp Pendleton during World 
War II. Many of them had joined the Marine Corps during the war; others worked 
as support staff during the labor-needy war years. 
</P>
<P>
Most Samoans belong to the Congregational Christian Church, but the older 
generation also clings to many native beliefs and rites. For example, there are 
Samoan chiefs in Oceanside, continuing the social hierarchy of the islands. 
</P>
<P>
The chiefs, all-powerful back in the islands, have a mostly symbolic role here, 
but still influence the decisions of related Samoan families, even extended 
families and families from the chief's old village in Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
And it's common to see older Samoans wearing sandals and a traditional 
skirt-like garment, called a lava lava. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a strong culture and values, Godinet and other younger Samoan leaders 
bemoan a breakdown in many families. 
</P>
<P>
As many younger Samoans see it, the first generation is structured and 
unyielding, demanding discipline and respect from their children, keeping 
problems to themselves, and distrusting the American drive for material 
rewards. 
</P>
<P>
But newer generations trying to adapt to their new culture are seeking the 
hallmarks of American success -- independence, activities away from the family, 
fashionable clothes, nice cars, and money. 
</P>
<P>
Godinet observed that for Samoan youth, "there's a mixed message. The same time 
they're trying to adapt to Western culture, learning about individualism and 
capitalism, we'd go home and everything was family oriented." 
</P>
<P>
Parents often don't understand the desire to stay out with friends rather than 
be with family; and when a Samoan youth earns money from a job, parents often 
expect the proceeds to be handed over to support the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
"If mom and dad buy me a bike, they can say it's mine, but it's really for the 
whole family," Godinet said. 
</P>
<P>
He said many Samoan-born parents, frustrated by their children's hunger for 
freedom and individuality, have often resorted to harsh discipline to maintain 
family order. 
</P>
<P>
Painfully recalling his own upbringing, Godinet, the son of a career Marine, 
said, "some of the physical spankings and disciplining would be termed close to 
that fine line of physical abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Even some younger Samoans express concern that assimilation is taking youth too 
far from cherished values or an awareness of their roots. 
</P>
<P>
George Molifua, a 42-year-old businessman and second generation Samoan, said "I 
remember my grandfather telling me legends (from) before there was a written 
language." 
</P>
<P>
"I want the children to know where they come from, who they are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While young and old Samoan leaders want youth to respect and know of their 
heritage, some also acknowledge Samoan-born parents must try to accept certain 
cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
Faatamalii Falo, a mental health social worker with the Union of Pan Asian 
Communities in San Diego said, "Parents are trying hard to limit the 
involvement of their children. They think that out there, something's going to 
happen. They're scared for their children." 
</P>
<P>
Parental efforts to control the children often brings confrontation that leaves 
parents isolated and estranged from their children, who are confused by the 
cultural clash. 
</P>
<P>
Falo said she tries to educate Samoan-born parents "not to give up their 
culture completely, but we need to meet our children born here halfway." 
</P>
<P>
During this time of introspection, Samoans leaders are talking about the need 
to end the stereotype that Samoan youths are big, aggressive and talented only 
in athletics. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 550 Samoans among the 16,000 students in the Oceanside public 
schools, and it's true many have distinguished themselves in sports. 
</P>
<P>
"We're known to much of the community as being great athletes," said Kimo 
Marquardt, a Samoan and vice principal of El Camino High School. What 
distresses him is how many Samoans drop out of school, and the fact that "very 
few" Samoans who are graduated from high school go on to college. 
</P>
<P>
Marquardt said, "the main challenge will be to keep the students in school and 
go on for higher education." He believes greater academic successes largely 
depend Samoan parents, many of whom have failed to take an active role in their 
children's education. 
</P>
<P>
The young generation of Samoan leaders is also concerned about the poverty in 
their community, although even here there is a dichotomy. While many work hard, 
sometimes taking two low-paying jobs to make ends meet, others simply don't 
seek material goods and prefer to live modestly. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, getting a fix on Samoan poverty is elusive, mainly because they 
quietly take care of themselves and few are seen homeless or begging. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very close-knit community that takes care of its own," said Carol 
Baenziger, spokeswoman for the county Department of Social Services. "There are 
not many receiving public assistance." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition of leaders is determined to see Samoans break out of their 
cultural shell and solve some specific problems, including youthful drug use 
and gang membership. 
</P>
<P>
Rev. Afaese said, "one of the greatest challenges of my own ministry is the 
youth. They are more and more moving toward drugs and gangs and away from the 
work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
Godinet said most Samoans don't vote and have traditionally shied away from 
community events, whether political or social. 
</P>
<P>
"We're powerless when we talk to the city council or any politician because we 
don't have a voting block," said Godinet, who envisions a time when Samoans 
take their needs and ideas down to City Hall and feel more a part of the 
community's cultural fabric. 
</P>
<P>
Rev. Afaese remembers that when he moved here from the islands 15 years ago, 
"we tried to organize ourselves into some association, but nobody was 
interested." 
</P>
<P>
Although Alfaese, Godinet and others believe the time is right for involvement, 
they're still cautious, not knowing for sure whether their call for activism in 
the wake of the Tate shooting will mobilize large numbers of Samoans. 
</P>
<P>
Said Godinet: "Now we've identified our problems, we're caught without funding 
or a voter base. If we continue like that, we're fundamentally hopeless."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: STARRY LINK TO GIS AN ENRICHING IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twinkle, twinkle little gimmick. Or: Canis Major, $39.95 and patriotism, too. 
</P>
<P>
As Operation Desert Shield drags on, the San Diego-based Star Heritage Society 
looks to the heavens for inspiration and profit. 
</P>
<P>
For $39.95, you can have a genuine star (i.e. Polaris, Aquarius, etc.) 
dedicated to your loved one serving in Saudi Arabia or the Persian Gulf. Plus 
authenticity certificate and star chart. 
</P>
<P>
The loved one gets a similar chart. The two can then gaze upon the same star at 
the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Says the promotional material: 
</P>
<P>
"They are drawn together, joined in a brief communion that lets them focus on 
each other; on thoughts of home, happier times and the day they will be 
re-joined. It is an age-old pledging of love." 
</P>
<P>
This is the work of Marv Gold, San Diego advertising man and president of Star 
Heritage. 
</P>
<P>
He's been selling stars for several years. Along came the standoff in the 
desert, and Gold knew a good thing when he saw it. 
</P>
<P>
Gold says he'll donate some of his profits to the USO, maybe 10%. Credit cards 
welcome, an 800 number is available. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so little for the troops to do," Gold said. "If the dedicated star 
gives them something to look it, if it provides a little heart tug, a focal 
point in the sky, it has redeeming value." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, people could get their own star charts for free in any good 
astronomy text. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but they wouldn't have the certificate of dedication," Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
People could also adopt the moon: big, lovable, identifiable, centuries of 
poetry extolling it. "Stars are better. More personal." 
</P>
<P>
And there is the time difference. Saudi Arabia is 11 hours ahead of San Diego 
(also several centuries behind, but that's a different story). Dark here, light 
there and vice versa. Making simultaneous stargazing difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Details, details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politcal Payoff Overdue 
</P>
<P>
It might be best not to mention the names Pete Wilson or Duke Cunningham at 
Point Loma Nazarene College. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the Nov. 6 election, a Republican operative appeared at chapel 
(students must attend chapel three times a week) with a tempting offer: $50 for 
each student willing to spend an afternoon walking precincts. 
</P>
<P>
Plus a $300 bonus for each of the five students whose precincts showed the 
highest voter turnout. Payment within five days. 
</P>
<P>
A hundred students signed up and were shipped to precincts from Southeast San 
Diego to Chula Vista. A month later, they're still waiting to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Cherry, 22, a sociology major, called Cunningham's office, Wilson's office 
and Republican headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Cherry says he was told: The check is in the mail, your W-2 was filled out 
wrong, there's been a snafu because so many students answered the call. 
</P>
<P>
"We got out there and hustled votes," he said. "Cunningham barely won. We put 
him in office, now we want to be paid." 
</P>
<P>
A Republican Party spokesman says the payroll people have been swamped but that 
the checks should arrive in a week or so. Cherry says he'll believe it when he 
sees it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foot-Sore Attorney 
</P>
<P>
Shoes are made for walking. Not removing. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Bernardo attorney Mike Klarfeld is fighting to overturn a rule that 
allows security guards to force people to remove their shoes to enter the 
federal courthouse in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
If the metal-detector goes buzz as you pass through the portals, you may be 
ordered to remove your wingtips. 
</P>
<P>
Klarfeld sees no reason to remove his loafers and walk 20 feet over a dirty 
floor to retrieve them. "A bureaucratic abuse," he fumed. 
</P>
<P>
He filed suit. Thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney in Los Angeles says the shoe rule is needed to guard against 
terrorism. Assistant U.S. Atty. Jim Sullivan calls Klarfeld "a knowledgeable 
and likable gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
Also persistent. Last week he appealed to the 9th Circuit Court in Pasadena.

Similar robberies at two gas stations may be the work of a serial robber, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The first incident, at an Arco station in the 3300 block of El Cajon Blvd., 
occurred at 9:10 p.m. Saturday, when a robber jumped over the counter, shot the 
clerk in the leg with a handgun, took cash from the register and fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour later, authorities said, possibly the same man entered another 
Arco station in the 8800 block of Clairemont Mesa Blvd. He, too, jumped over 
the counter, shot the clerk in the leg, raided the register and fled. 
</P>
<P>
After consulting with some detectives in the robbery division who are 
investigating the two incidents, Sgt. Chuck Peck said, "They may be related and 
may be the start of a new series of robberies."

A live-in caretaker convicted of stealing from her elderly patients has been 
sentenced to two years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Vivian Underwood, 39, was sentenced by Superior Court Judge William J. Howatt 
Jr., who also ordered her placed on probation for five years and to pay $15,000 
in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Underwood pleaded guilty to grand theft for the unauthorized use of a patient's 
credit card in a plea-bargain agreement in which another charge was dropped. 
She also pleaded no contest to grand theft in a case in which an $11,500 ring 
was stolen from an invalid woman at Mercy Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
According to the victims' family members, Underwood used the credit cards to 
pay for things such as a home entertainment system and a television satellite 
dish. 
</P>
<P>
"In all my years as a prosecutor, I don't think I've seen a case of theft just 
like this," Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Pettine. 
</P>
<P>
The judge demanded that Underwood inform any future employers of her 
convictions, and ordered her not to pursue work that involved the care of an 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Pettine said Underwood is wanted on eight outstanding warrants in Florida, 
where she has been convicted of grand larceny and passing bad checks, leading 
to a 2 1/2-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been a thief all of her life. . . . I think she's earned her (prison) 
time in the state of California," Pettine said.

</P>
<P>
According to Officer Bob George, police were summoned at 3:59 p.m. Sunday to 
the swap meet in the 3400 block of Mission Ave. They found an unidentified man 
dead at the scene from apparent stab wounds to the chest. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty minutes earlier, police had broken up a large fight at the swap meet and 
witnesses said the victim and his assailant had participated in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that most of the subjects involved are migrant field workers," 
George said in a statement.

REIGNING CAT AND DOG IN MURDER MYSTERY; 
</P>

WISH YOU WERE HERE, BY RITA MAE BROWN AND SNEAKY PIE BROWN. BANTAM BOOKS, 
$18.95, 256 PAGES

Rita Mae Brown's agenda isn't hidden, but it sure is mysterious. She's capable 
of writing books like "Songs to a Handsome Woman" and that literary landmark, 
"Ruby Fruit Jungle," but she obviously has neither the temperament nor the 
inclination to become any kind of morose successor to Radclyffe Hall. Brown is 
not even like Florence King, that quirky female genius who went from radical 
lesbianism in her earlier books to right-wing gun-slinging in her later ones. 
</P>
<P>
And to throw in just one last literary reference, you remember that man who 
declared "a separate peace"? Well, it's as if Rita Mae Brown has written and 
signed off on her own separate Declaration of Independence. She'll write about 
lesbianism when she feels like it, or the Civil War when she feels like it, or 
take the time to write an excellent book on the Writing Life ("Starting From 
Scratch"), or in this case, just kick back and let her cat -- Sneaky Pie Brown 
-- write a murder mystery. 
</P>
<P>
In a time and place where writers are gnawing their fingernails to the nub 
about reputation and money and careers and God only knows what else, this 
reckless behavior is both baffling and refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
To get the clue on Sneaky Pie, or "Mrs. Murphy," as she names herself, you have 
to go back in time to Rudyard Kipling, who let animals talk in his "Jungle 
Books," and then back forward in time to the work of animal trainer Vicki 
Hearne, who knows for sure that animals are far smarter than humans. Mrs. 
Murphy is the pet tiger cat of a nice young woman named Harry, the postmistress 
of the town of Crozet, Va. Mrs. Murphy shares house and bed space with a nice 
Welsh corgi, Tee Tucker, and this amiable dog-and-cat team do everything they 
can to cheer up their owner, Harry, that nice woman who's going through a hard 
divorce from a man named Fair, who's not very "fair" at all. 
</P>
<P>
The plot of this novel is rambunctious and wacky. A paving contractor gets a 
cemetery post card, and within a few days, ends up squished in his own cement 
mixer. A Yankee woman named Maude Bly Modena, who makes an extremely good 
living in a store that packs and ships parcels, gets a cemetery post card, and 
soon after ends up squashed by a train. The sheriff of Crozet is just dense 
enough that Harry-the-Postmistress decides to help him find the murderer. Of 
course, from Mrs. Murphy and Tee Tucker's point of view, they're the ones who 
do all the detecting. 
</P>
<P>
There's a much more serious subplot. The mayor's daughter is getting married, 
but because the mayor's son has earlier married a black woman and left town in 
disgrace, he's not going to be invited. The mayor's wife is a tiresome social 
climber and won't allow it. Will justice be done? Will the son, and his lovely 
black wife be invited back home for a reconciliation? Yes ma'am, just as sure 
as that intrepid cat and dog will find out who squished the contractor in the 
cement mixer and who squashed the Yankee lady on the railroad track. 
</P>
<P>
This carefree canvass is really just a place for Rita Mae Brown -- who, 
remember, has declared independence from the rest of us -- to air certain of 
her own views on the human, feline and canine condition. Harry-the-Postmistress 
has a best friend, who notices, while watching Harry and her almost-ex-husband, 
that he's playing that favorite ex-husband-game, "Starve the Wife." Do it long 
enough, the friend observes, and the wife will lose her nerve and courage. 
Since husbands don't think wives do anything anyway, they won't feel guilt 
about not paying alimony, just rage that somebody somewhere has stopped ironing 
their shirts. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of psychopaths, serial killers and the like, Harry's cat and dog 
have many a philosophical discussion. When a "sick" human being is born, why 
not kill it off right away, weed out the litter, so to speak, so that adult 
human beings who are cracked to begin with won't grow up to kill, kill and kill 
again? For that matter, why kill at all, unless for food? And while they're on 
the subject, why are human beings so incredibly dumb? They can't see, they 
can't hear, they can't smell anything at all. Mrs. Murphy and Tee Tucker wash 
their collective paws of the human race, and you can see, at some level, Rita 
Mae Brown does too. Independence is her great thing. And animals, and nature, 
and a few friends. Not a bad agenda, come to think of it.

FILLING UP WITH ED RUSCHA; 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 RETROSPECTIVE OF THE ARTIST'S WORK AT THE MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART 
SHOWS THAT THE AMERICAN STANDARD ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Ruscha's 1963 "Standard Station" has become an icon of a vanished Camelot. 
The artist's 75-work retrospective that opened Sunday at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art features a 1989 reprise of the station, truncated, abandoned 
and corroded black by smog. The contrast with the optimistic original has the 
jolt of truth. The American standard is not what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, no sight was more familiar to Mr. and Mrs. America than the Standard 
station on the corner. Drive the family Ford in and Joe would fill her up with 
super at 25 cents a gallon, check the oil and clean the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
It was all so commonplace that people were baffled when the young hot-dog L.A. 
artist Rusha made a picture of one of the stations. He rendered it in Old Glory 
colors against a gorgeous sunset. He saw the building in awed perspective as if 
he were sitting in the gutter looking up at a cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
The picture would become as renowned as Andy Warhol's Campbell's soup cans. 
Nobody knew exactly what made these images so compelling. They just seemed 
right for the time -- sort of pleasantly subversive. 
</P>
<P>
Today we know. Standard stations started crumbling into myth with the Mideast 
oil extortions of the '70s. Now we pay a buck fifty in advance for the 
privilege of pumping our own, and to maintain even this reduced standard of 
civilization, we are massing hundreds of thousands of troops on the borders of 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Ruscha's intuitive abilities as a social soothsayer contribute mightily to 
his remarkable talent. The retrospective proves he is even more extraordinary 
than we thought. Organized by Paris' Centre Georges Pompidou, the show is 
dominated by recent work seen here for the first time. It redeems the artist 
for those of us who found his middle period a bit of a slump. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, it was easy to take him for a down-home Oklahoma kid with a 
Pop sensibility, a lot of unforced charm and the dangerous good looks of the 
young Elvis. He did weird, funny things. He produced a fold-out photo book of 
all the buildings on the Sunset Strip, made a hilarious movie about sex and 
saltine crackers with Larry Bell and then "road tested" a typewriter by 
throwing it out the window of a speeding car. Not enough of that Ruscha shows 
in this retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the early Pop period is represented by a purposely abraded painting of 
the words "War Surplus." These days, it is bound to be read as "Surplus War," a 
muffled protest against the old mess in Vietnam. Ruscha has been prescient, but 
he is also the affectionate lyric loony who painted "Annie" in homage to one of 
the more glamorous birds of the Pop era. It's not in the show. No painter has 
ever been more accurate or endearing than when Ruscha confessed that, "I don't 
know what in the hell I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
In short, he is a real artist. 
</P>
<P>
This show, however, has been organized to play up his later image as a 
precursor of Conceptual art, a darling of the heady European retardataire 
avant-garde that has produced enough boring elephantine art to fill dozens of 
warehouses and scores of Ph.D. dissertations. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Ruscha survived it. Turning 53 this week, he's as at ease posing 
for a bluejeans ad as he is being anatomized by a semioticist. Who minds being 
both the guru of the academics and the quintessential star of L.A. art? 
Unfortunately, the Beaubourg show is heavy on Ruscha's sometimes problematic 
word-work canvases. Even with that limitation it is clear he's never given up 
the essential goals of a real painter, namely to produce sensations that are 
more physical than purely intellectual. When Ruscha paints the word "Vaseline," 
you can feel it slide and giggle at the implications. His sense of absurdity 
lurks in "High Speed Gardening." His intimacy is alive in "Those Golden 
Spasms." 
</P>
<P>
He's a little naughty sometimes. But in "Sex," the sheer nastiness of the 
painting shows how leery everybody has gotten about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even when his paint surface is as tacky as Velcro, Ruscha keeps plugging 
away. He's self-conscious about the artist's new role as social commentator in 
"Japan Is America." He makes up for it in "He Busts Into a Union Hall and Yells 
Out, 'O.K. What Is it You Guys Want, PONTIAC CATALINAS?" 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, however, the work is dominated by unease. It grows black like 
that of Goya's final period. It is not ferocious like Goya, it's worried.

Worried about America. 
</P>
<P>
The new paintings are done in black silhouette like old American folk-art 
portrait cut-outs but they look sprayed and atmospheric, adding to the sense of 
regret and mounting gloom. 
</P>
<P>
He starts at home with "Black Hollywood." It's a perceptually remarkable 
picture in that it uses the barest suggestion to turn a word into a landscape. 
But it is far from a happy vision of Tinseltown. 
</P>
<P>
Those modest, dark bungalows he's been painting are like houses you glimpse at 
night from the freeway, their lighted windows glowing with a wonderful sense of 
private mystery and fragile security. Intimacy is hallmarked with inserted 
monograms. Others have a line on the bottom to sign on, playing up the 
ephemeral reality of everyman's ultimate refuge. 
</P>
<P>
America is in a literal uphill struggle against the endangerment of its myth of 
greatness in shrouded images of a wagon train, a Chevy pickup and an elephant 
that looks like Sisyphus. 
</P>
<P>
Two Clipper ships leaning hard into the wind are identified first as "Man, 
Wife" then as, "Chain and Cable." It's all about strained relationships 
searching for stability, a troubled vision but not a hopeless one. It's uphill 
but we're struggling. Sometimes it makes him weary. He sees a bogged-down 
anchor and longs for "Industrial Strength Sleep." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, there's something epic in Ruscha's work. The sea pictures 
call up Herman Melville. Sinclair Lewis' shade is evoked in an image of an 
"Exit" sign and a cemetery for other placards. Ruscha still makes jokes. 
"Cemetery for Signs" could be an amiable put-down of MOCA's exhibition "A 
Forest of Signs," and the poet's rejection of his branding as a Conceptualist. 
Anyway, its not very important. 
</P>
<P>
What is important is Ruscha's sounding of new depths. He is no more just an 
L.A. artist anymore than L.A. is just a province of somewhere else. He takes on 
Anselm Kiefer in "17th Century" and blows fresh air into the more ponderous 
precincts of German Neo-Expressionism. He still can't resist little in-house 
art jabs. Luckily he always reverberates his way into wider territory. 
</P>
<P>
His use of Gothic lettering is not new, but now the letters carry the gravity 
of biblical association. His capacity for dealing with abstract concepts is not 
new either, but it has never opened greater philosophical space than in "Five 
Past Eleven." Here a huge Big Ben-style clock face looks out on a bamboo pole 
floating before it and becomes a picture of all of us searching for meaning by 
fishing in time. 
</P>
<P>
Something quietly triumphant about this exhibition echoes a phenomenon that's 
been going on here for a couple of years. L.A. artists such as Ed Moses, Joe 
Goode, Tony Berlant and Frank Gehry have come to full artistic maturity in 
their 50s and 60s. Now Ruscha joins them in reminding us to take heart. Growing 
a full-blown artist takes a long time. 
</P>
<P>
Patience.

Kidder Suit: Actress Margot Kidder on Friday sued the producers of a television 
series, claiming that she may have suffered permanent injuries in a car 
accident during filming. In a claim filed Friday in British Columbia Supreme 
Court, Kidder said she has continuous muscle spasms in her neck and back, 
numbness and lack of circulation in her left leg and nerve damage to her left 
arm, left shoulder and neck. The suit seeks damages from Toronto-based Nelvana 
Ltd. and N.D. Productions B.C. Ltd. of Vancouver from an October accident in 
which Kidder was injured during filming of a series based on the Nancy Drew 
mystery books. CLAUDIA PUIG

Shields vs. Saudi Arabia: Brooke Shields may be too hot for Saudi Arabia.

Shields had been planning to leave today under the auspices of the USO to visit 
U.S. troops in Operation Desert Shield but the Saudi government refused to 
issue her a visa on the grounds that she is "a young, single, female 
entertainer," the New York Daily News reported. Shields said she had planned to 
follow strict Muslim codes of dress and behavior for women while in Saudi 
Arabia and was disappointed to learn that she wouldn't be going. CLAUDIA PUIG

COUNTERPUNCH: IS AN ACTOR'S COURAGE ALWAYS TO BE CONDEMNED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIDNEY LUMET, Lumet, a four-time Oscar nominee (12 Angry Men, Dog Day 
Afternoon, Network and The Verdict) directed Paul Newman in The Verdict. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the theme of Kenneth Turan's article on actors departing from their "star" 
roles ("Paul, This Isn't You," Calendar, Dec. 2) was valid, we never would have 
had Garbo in "Ninotchka," Marlon Brando in "The Godfather" or Humphrey Bogart 
in "The Treasure of Sierra Madre." I don't know whether any of these actors 
were trying to "stretch," but certainly nothing in their previous work would 
have prepared an audience for those magnificent performances. And I could cite 
many more examples. 
</P>
<P>
It is true we have always had two kinds of stars: those whose performances came 
from the exploitation of their personas (I'm not using the word exploitation 
pejoratively) and those whose work falls into the general category of 
"character" acting. From Mae West to Paul Muni. 
</P>
<P>
But to use this as a stick to beat actors who can bridge both is, to me, 
arrogant. To go after Paul Newman is just silly. 
</P>
<P>
When you analyze Newman's work over the years, there is an astonishing range in 
it. When the first shot of him appeared in "The Sting," no exposition was 
necessary. The character was so complete, you knew the whole pre-picture life 
of the man. This was true of him in "The Verdict" and in Robert Rossen's "The 
Hustler." 
</P>
<P>
I pick these movies because on the surface, they are all con men. Yet can 
anyone say that the characterizations are similar? Of course not. They are 
three different people. Paul Newman's best work has always been "character" 
acting. "Somebody Up There Likes Me," "Hud," "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof." Newman 
"stretched" a long time before Turan became aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
I also disagree with Turan about Newman's performance in "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge." 
I think he is superb. One of the hardest kinds of acting is to reveal the inner 
life of a character without using words or situations that label the person. 
The underlying level of fear, almost terror, that lay beneath that smug, 
self-satisfied, middle-class man is, to me, extraordinary acting. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not the most upsetting thing in Turan's article. There is a tone in 
it that seems to want to settle, like so much else today, for what is easily 
identifiable. "Just give us your blue eyes, baby." "Why don't you just take 
your overbloated salaries and stop trying to do 'good' things?" 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Turan is historically wrong about movie acting only adds to his 
condescension. Is there anything in Katharine Hepburn's "persona" performance 
in "Stage Door" to prepare us for the magnificence of her "character" work in 
"Long Day's Journey Into Night" or "The African Queen"? How would Turan 
classify Spencer Tracy, James Mason, Bette Davis, Ingrid Bergman or Robin 
Williams? 
</P>
<P>
There is real harm in this kind of criticism, illustrated by what happened last 
year to Michelle Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer came to New York to appear in "Twelfth 
Night." The production and she were torn to shreds by critics. I saw it and 
thought she was wonderful. When one considers that it was her first 
Shakespearean performance, it bordered on the miraculous. The point is, I doubt 
if she'll try the theater again, much less Shakespeare, and that's my loss. We 
all lose by it. 
</P>
<P>
For me, all good acting has human revelation in it. The actor has nothing to 
use but him or herself. Come, come, Mr. Turan. It's not your face, heart, soul 
and body up there. It's theirs. Since when is courage something to be 
condemned? You don't even pay for your admission. If you want safety and 
security when you reach into your box of popcorn, you've always got all those 
sequels to look forward to.

KATHAK PROGRAM AT OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If kathak, the ancient Indian dance form, can tell elaborate stories about the 
gods, why not adapt it to the contemporary story of a girl torn between 
obedience to her Indian family and the desire to imitate her American peers? 
</P>
<P>
That was the idea behind Anjani Ambegaokar's new dance-drama, "Ma Aur Betiyan" 
(Mothers and Daughters), performed by her small company during an otherwise 
traditional kathak program at Thorne Hall, Occidental College, on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The piece was marred by stilted verbal exchanges between mother and daughter 
before each brief black-out scene, and insensitive chopping of the taped music 
("Passages," a collaboration of Ravi Shankar and Philip Glass). Some of the 
themes were hard to puzzle out from the movements, and some scenes baldly 
illustrated the ideas but didn't work as theater. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there were lovely moments reminiscent of traditional Indian themes. 
Ambegaokar's joyous romp with her unseen baby and her cross mimic of her 
daughter bopping to music on earphones recalled incidents from Krishna's 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the program, Ambegaokar's dancing was dazzling -- her warmly regal 
presence, the darting precision of her arms, the disparate moods that played 
over her face. In "Shastriya Kathak Nritya," her rocketing feet handily kept 
pace with virtuoso tabla player Abdul Sattar Tari's fusillade of drumming. 
</P>
<P>
The company charmer was Kavita Jain, with her beauty-queen smile, delicate 
gestures and sharply accented movements. Vocalist Mala Ganguly provided the 
butter-smooth accompaniment, and Scott Marcus played the sitar. CATHY CURTIS

PARK EXPLORES PERSONAL, CULTURAL IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when "Dandelion," Young-Ae Park's modern dance program Friday at the 
Barnsdall Park Gallery Theatre in Hollywood, seemed hopelessly mired in 
prettiness, the choreographer pulled a fast one. 
</P>
<P>
She dropped all the outdated sylph-like imagery for the raw irony of "English 
Lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Here, in a context of a mock rock video (music by Nobuko Miyamoto, lyrics by 
Park), Park attempts to communicate her emotional needs through broken English 
to her lover (Allen Tombello), but finds his insistence upon good grammar 
ultimately defeating. The personal becomes the cultural and vice versa. 
Intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing else on the program measured up to this work. Park could find, arrest, 
manipulate and dismiss force fields of energy within and around her tensile, 
lithe body ("Da Mong"). She could express moments of wistfulness or 
vulnerability ("Return"). But while she always looked interesting, rarely did 
she induce you to empathize with her. 
</P>
<P>
As a choreographer for others, Park could draw on a sense of pictorial balance 
and design, utilize movement counterpoint and wrap everything up in cyclic 
structures ("Descent" and "Moon Ya"). The program opened and closed, for 
instance, with a soloist isolated under a light from the ceiling, and that 
image recurred in many of the works on the program. 
</P>
<P>
But she also could seriously misjudge proportion and effect. While the pretty 
images occasionally gave way to more horrific suggestions (in "Descent" and 
"Moon Ya"), Park spent so much time drawing out the lyric side of things that 
by the time the characters got around to expressing any suffering, who could 
care? CHRIS PASLES

HANK CRAWFORD SERVES UP A BLUES SET AT MARLA'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hank Crawford, the Memphis-born, emotionally-charged alto saxophonist whose 
name has become a virtual synonym for soul, was in town Friday and Saturday 
leading a quartet at Marla's Memory Lane. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford's voluminous, boisterous sound, honed long ago in the bands of B. B. 
King and Ray Charles, manages to turn almost any song into a blues, even if it 
is a conventional 1930s ballad like "My Romance," his opener at Friday's first 
show. 
</P>
<P>
But the blues form itself is his forte, as he made stridently evident in the 
next three numbers: A fast blues with busy drum and keyboard solos by Don 
Littleton and Bobby Pierce; and a slow, sensuous blues called "Uncle Funky" in 
which Crawford's bent, keening tones seemed to scream in agony. 
</P>
<P>
A shuffle-rhythm blues followed, with a curious solo by Leroy Ball, whose 
electric bass has a cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof sound. Then it was back to standards, 
with a hard-nosed electric funk groove applied to "I Can't Get Started." 
Whatever Crawford may lack in subtlety, he compensates for in infectious 
projection. 
</P>
<P>
Opening for the quartet was a trio whose combined age is less than Crawford's. 
Karon Harrison, 14, who studied drums under Billy Higgins, was joined by 
16-year-old Jason White, a Cedar Walton protege, at the piano, and Christy 
Smith (an older man, possibly even past his teens) on electric bass. This 
promising group managed to stay within the parameters of jazz, playing "Blue 
Bossa" and "Solar" to show its credentials. LEONARD FEATHER

A MUSHY STORY OF THE WIZARD BEHIND 'THE WIZARD OF OZ' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We're off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of Oz. Only NBC's yellow 
brick road leads to the wizard of ooze. 
</P>
<P>
Its story about the author of the children's book that inspired that 1939 movie 
classic, "The Wizard of Oz," is long on mush and short on magic. Airing at 9 
tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39, "The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story" 
finds John Ritter playing Baum as a one-dimensional bo-bo of such unfaltering 
goodness that he makes Mr. Rogers look like the Marquis de Sade. 
</P>
<P>
Following one business failure after another, Baum ultimately converts his 
fanciful dreams and yarns into a best-selling children's book, "The Wonderful 
Wizard of Oz." Other successful books follow. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Richard Matheson and directed by Jack Bender, "The Dreamer of Oz" is 
at once a 19th-Century maudlin love story (with Annette O'Toole as Baum's loyal 
wife, Maud) and an unfulfilled kid's story. With Ritter giving mostly a 
single-note performance, Baum comes alive only through his own imagination, as 
the stories he tells to enthralled children are translated on screen into 
charming fantasy. Here is where we meet Dorothy, the brainless scarecrow, the 
heartless tin man, the cowardly lion and other characters in his best-known 
book, including the Wiz himself, all of them inspired by people Baum knows. 
</P>
<P>
Although these blazingly colorful sequences are mostly delightful fun and 
imaginatively mounted, they're too infrequent to dent an otherwise stolid 
melodrama whose only spunky character is Baum's critical mother-in-law (Rue 
McClanahan). 
</P>
<P>
The message -- that dreams are the best part of us -- is very nice. Otherwise, 
this is woolly wizardry at best. HOWARD ROSENBERG

FISH MAY HOLD CYSTIC FIBROSIS CLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A genetic discovery in electric ray fish may shed new light on cystic fibrosis 
in humans and help the search for drugs against the common, inherited fatal 
disease, researchers said last week. 
</P>
<P>
German scientists said they have identified and duplicated a gene that codes 
for production of a protein that regulates the flow of salt in and out of cells 
of electric rays. 
</P>
<P>
That finding could have important implications for cystic fibrosis patients 
because defective salt regulation is a central feature of the disorder, in 
which thick mucus clogs the lungs and leads to life-threatening infections. 
About one in 2,000 white babies are stricken by cystic fibrosis, and most 
patients die before age 40. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, researchers pinpointed the genetic flaw that causes about 70% of 
cystic fibrosis cases. But contrary to expectations, the affected gene did not 
code for production of a salt gateway, called a chloride channel. Instead, 
researchers suspect the gene codes for a channel for another type of molecule, 
which regulates chloride traffic through another, undiscovered channel.

Chloride -- which is a component of salt -- helps regulate cells' water 
balance, and upsetting that balance may be what causes the mucus of cystic 
fibrosis patients to thicken. 
</P>
<P>
In a study published in the journal Nature, Thomas Jentsch and colleagues from 
Hamburg University said they were able to find the gene for chloride channels 
in so-called torpedo rays with almost no knowledge of what type of gene or 
protein for which they were searching. The protein does not resemble any other 
channel yet discovered in cell membranes.

VENTURA BOULEVARD: THE CITY COUNCIL ON DEC. 18 WILL TAKE UP A PLAN TO CONTROL 
DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE VALLEY'S MAIN THOROUGHFARE. EVEN THE MERCHANTS CAN'T

Finding Ventura Boulevard is no problem. Drive south to the gridlock and there 
you are. 
</P>
<P>
Determining the future direction of the San Fernando Valley's main street and 
commercial anchor is another matter, one the Los Angeles City Council will 
tackle this month. 
</P>
<P>
The street has been changing for a decade, amid controversies that have frayed 
the nerves of politicians, builders, homeowner groups and merchants. Today, 
many stretches seem to consist of one fancy clothing store, hairstyling salon, 
nail parlor, cute little mini-mall and trendy restaurant after another. 
</P>
<P>
There are still hot dog stands amid the valet parking. A few days ago, 
red-vested attendants shuttled Jaguars in and out of the parking lot of a 
popular eatery called Mary's Lamb, while a few doors away, a white 
Mercedes-Benz pulled into the driveway of Arthur's Hideaway, an adults-only 
motel. But the trend is decidedly toward fancier retailing and bigger 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything goes here, as long as it's quality," said Raspin Stuwart, publisher 
of On the Boulevard, a publication distributed in shops along the street. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not forever. The City Council on Dec. 18 will take up a plan to control 
development along Ventura Boulevard's 17 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was formulated largely by a group of developers, homeowners and 
community leaders. It has been the focus of bitter debate over whether it is 
fair to property owners. 
</P>
<P>
It would establish a limit of 8.6 million square feet of additional commercial 
development over the next 20 years along the boulevard in Studio City, Sherman 
Oaks, Encino, Tarzana and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The debate promises to be warm. 
</P>
<P>
Developers say many aspects of the plan are too restrictive and would lessen 
their property values. Some homeowners have said it is not restrictive enough. 
They argue that the street is already congested by much of the existing 19 
million square feet of development -- specifically several high-rise office 
buildings and complexes that dwarf longstanding small businesses and nearby 
residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Rip Rense, a free-lance writer who lives in Sherman Oaks, said he enjoyed 
late-night strolls on Ventura Boulevard 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a comfort in the isolation of it all," he said. "There was nothing 
open, no yogurt shops, no coffee shops." 
</P>
<P>
That obviously has changed, and not for the better, in his view. 
</P>
<P>
"I do like the new activity, seeing the night spots and all the color," Rense 
said. "But I seldom go out for walks anymore because along with all this life 
has come an abiding unfriendliness of spirit. In the summer, there is a 
never-ending parade of young Valley schoolchildren in their $50,000 
automobiles, screaming and salivating out the window." 
</P>
<P>
Motorists, mostly not screaming, make about 70,000 trips a day on Ventura 
Boulevard. Planners say that if there were no controls on growth, about 40 
million square feet of development and 150,000 more vehicle trips would be 
generated in 20 years, resulting in round-the-clock traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the plan under study include restricting the height of most new 
buildings to two or three stories and requiring commercial property owners to 
pay for upgrading Ventura to accommodate the traffic that additional 
development will bring. The council could approve, reject or change the plan. 
Some observers do not expect a vote until early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Many homeowners and merchants say the length of the street west of Sepulveda 
Boulevard shows growth's worst aspect. That's the home of high-rises whose 
construction about 10 years ago spurred homeowners to try to prevent similar 
development. A temporary moratorium on development is in effect. 
</P>
<P>
"There is gross overdevelopment west of Sepulveda," said Los Angeles City 
Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents part of the Studio City portion of the 
boulevard. Politicians and homeowners blame previous city administrations for 
the poor planning. 
</P>
<P>
One couple who want to see the plan go forward are Dennis and Bunny Delluge, 
who run Diane &amp; Rudy &amp; Sons Fountain &amp; Statuary in Tarzana. The 
couple said passage of the plan would reduce their property values -- and they 
are all for it. 
</P>
<P>
The Delluges said a large developer is angling to take over the business to 
build a shopping center on the property, which is at Vanalden Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see this beautiful setting destroyed," Bunny Delluge said as 
she walked among tree-shaded stone angels. "We want to keep this place just the 
way it is. It's been in the family since the 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald A. Silver, an outspoken Encino resident who thinks that the plan is too 
permissive, said his doctor put him on a strict diet because his blood pressure 
has gotten too high over his reaction to development on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a traffic nightmare, an example of unplanned growth and the caving in to 
developer-driven planning," said Silver, the slimmed-down but agitated head of 
Homeowners of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
His voice became more shrill as he continued: "Twenty years ago, the street was 
an ideal, community-oriented shopping strip. There was anything you wanted -- 
supermarkets, restaurants, music stores, seed and garden shops. You could drive 
up one side, park and do all your business, then park on the other side and do 
the rest of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I cuss and swear whenever I drive down the street. My blood pressure 
shoots up. We've lost almost all of our community shopping. Now it's just a 
developer gold rush to put in more buildings. The street is just one bank and 
copy store on top of the other." 
</P>
<P>
To some business people, the street is better than it's ever been and getting 
better all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to blow this boring Valley image out," said Lenny Flahm, 30, owner 
of Lenny Salon in Sherman Oaks. "This is the new Valley." He would like to see 
more glitz, trendier businesses and a lot more advertising for the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The new Valley charges Beverly Hills prices. Flahm says he charges about $30 to 
$45 for a haircut, and "the prices go up from there." Lee Willis, co-owner of 
the Jona boutique, said his store carries designer merchandise with a "Rodeo 
Drive-type" price tag: Moderate to expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Flahm said the business climate of the boulevard has yet to peak. "It's a great 
street because no matter what you want, you can find it here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Developers regard Ventura Boulevard as prime real estate for large shopping 
centers, multiplex cinemas and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of some stylish businesses have found Ventura Boulevard to be a gold 
mine, not unlike other affluent business districts of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Westsiders have been driving over to swank restaurants along the boulevard, 
including the Bistro Gardens, a $3-million restaurant that is the local 
offspring of a Westside spot. Dinner without wine averages $70 a person, lunch, 
$25. 
</P>
<P>
That establishment, near Coldwater Canyon Avenue and Ventura Boulevard, is the 
centerpiece of a $15-million shopping center built by developer Herbert M. 
Piken, who calls it an example of suburban elegance. Piken has built seven 
shopping centers on the boulevard. He is not surprised that the street supports 
an upscale restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"There are actors and others from the studios who will come here," he said. 
"There's nothing like it in the entire Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Piken is a villain to homeowner groups. Opposition to his center at Coldwater 
dragged the project a year behind schedule and $2 million over budget. 
</P>
<P>
Piken said he does not understand the emotional reaction of the community 
toward development. 
</P>
<P>
"There are always people who try to keep things from happening," he said. "But 
I took rides down the boulevard near Studio City. The stores were not that 
pretty. Sure they served the needs of the people, but they just weren't that 
attractive. If someone comes in with a nice project and landscaping, it should 
be welcomed. A lot of the boulevard needs to be more organized, better arranged 
and better utilized." 
</P>
<P>
The boulevard isn't everyone's river of money. Some large businesses have their 
problems, and so do little ones. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt by developer Dennis Bass to turn the historic La Reina movie theater 
in Sherman Oaks into a two-story, Melrose Avenue-caliber shopping mall flopped. 
Despite being near busy Van Nuys Boulevard and popular Tower Records &amp; 
Video stores, the center went bankrupt in August. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that the neighborhood would support that kind of upper class of 
business," said Bunny Dixon, property manager for Bass' development company. 
"We came in with a lot of the top names -- Pure Sweat, Mrs. Fields, New York 
Jock. 
</P>
<P>
"But Pure Sweat went bankrupt. New York Jock just walked out and abandoned the 
store. One day they just emptied everything out. Mrs. Fields' store is dying. 
They're doing a quarter of what they expected to do. Overall, we lost 10 
stores." 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong? Parking, Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
"The street doesn't lend itself to people parking and spending time here," she 
said. "Our parking lot was in back. We had plenty of parking, but people just 
didn't bother to go around the block. We also had a lot of foot traffic, but 
those people didn't spend any money. They just browsed." 
</P>
<P>
On a smaller scale, Renee Spina, who owns Urban Art, a clothing and 
leather-airbrushing store in Studio City, said she is struggling to become 
known. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you get people's attention when there's just store after store after 
store?" asked Spina, 24, who was a hostess at a Woodland Hills hamburger 
restaurant before starting Urban Art in June. Some days, no customers come 
through her doors and Spina is alone with a hamster named Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to be on Melrose, but it was too much money," Spina said. "So 
I came to the Valley. I thought having a Ventura Boulevard address would be 
better for the business than being somewhere else in the Valley. But it's been 
a real struggle. There's no foot traffic, and people just pass by because there 
isn't anywhere to park." 
</P>
<P>
To attract customers, Spina puts eye-catching clothes in her front window. A 
T-shirt with a flaming skull and two guitars in the background is the 
centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
She would like to move to a location with more pedestrian traffic, or into one 
of the new shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's ridiculous," she said. "Every one of these developers wants to charge 
$4.25 a square foot for rent. A small business can't possibly survive. It blows 
my mind. I would like to move, but when I do, it's going to be off Ventura 
Boulevard."

SAHARA CLUB REVVING UP TO CLAIM ECOLOGY GROUPS' TURF; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE GROUP CAME TO PUBLIC ATTENTION LAST MONTH WHEN FIVE MEMBERS 
WERE ARRESTED FOR RACING MOTORCYCLES ON PROTECTED DESERT LAND. 
</P>

Rick Sieman recycles his aluminum cans, grows his own vegetables and calls 
himself an environmentalist. 
</P>
<P>
But don't mistake the Granada Hills man for an "eco-freak" -- one of the 
politer terms he uses to describe members of Earth First!, the Sierra Club and 
even the National Audubon Society. In an office next to his back-yard vegetable 
patch, Sieman plots their undoing. 
</P>
<P>
Sieman, 50, is president of the Sahara Club, an upstart organization of mostly 
off-road racing and riding enthusiasts that received its first major dose of 
public attention last month when five members -- including Sieman -- were 
arrested for defying federal authorities and racing their motorcycles through 
protected land in the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Sieman publishes the caustic Sahara Club newsletter, which reports on 
activities of the environmental groups. He says he has spoken to off-roader 
clubs, logger organizations and gatherings of Sahara members from Arkansas to 
Northern California to share his wisdom on nonviolent protest, surveillance and 
even a few dirty tricks. The purpose, he says, is to reveal the "disinformation 
campaign" that environmental groups are engaged in. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be the organization that people can come to to get the real facts," 
Sieman said of his year-old group, which claims 4,000 members. "We want people 
to be able to get under one umbrella organization to fight the eco-freaks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are monkey-wrenching with the monkey-wrenchers," he said, referring to 
environmental defense tactics in Edward Abbey's novel "The Monkey Wrench Gang." 
The novel helped inspire the founding of Earth First! 
</P>
<P>
Sieman and three other Sahara Club bikers were arrested Nov. 24 as they sped 
their motorcycles around federal rangers onto land closed by the U.S. Bureau of 
Land Management. "I felt like Abbie Hoffman," Sieman said afterwards. A fifth 
member was arrested when he tried to block a U.S. Army tank from crossing the 
closed lands from nearby Ft. Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
The cyclists were protesting the cancellation of the world-famous Barstow to 
Las Vegas race. Conservation groups had doggedly fought the "B to V," as it is 
also called, charging that it crossed environmentally sensitive lands and 
endangered the desert tortoise. The cyclists vigorously deny that the race 
harms the land or animals. 
</P>
<P>
Though dismissed by some critics as a group of "motorcycle thugs," the Sahara 
Club now appears to be addressing a wide range of environmental issues, said 
Jim Eaton, executive director of the California Wilderness Coalition. But Eaton 
bristles at the club's insistence that its members are concerned about the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Any group can call themselves environmentalists," said Eaton, whose group has 
been criticized by the Sahara Club. "But the Sahara Club doesn't show an 
inkling of environmentalism. It's pretty clear they have no respect for the 
laws that protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"To them, the environmental movement is kind of the symbol of all that is 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Sieman is a professional off-road racer and a writer for magazines that cover 
the sport. He said he was inspired to start the Sahara Club last year when the 
BLM began trying to cancel the race and his son was knocked off his motorcycle 
by a "tripwire" strung between two Joshua trees while off-road riding near 
Lancaster. Sieman blames "eco-pigs" for putting the wire up. His son was not 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Though Sieman insists the fight against the environmentalists is largely a war 
of words, part of the advice he gives to groups involves what he darkly refers 
to as "top-secret dirty tricks," which he declines to reveal. He does, however, 
claim with amusement that after one of his talks to families of timber workers 
in Northern California in August, the cars of several Earth First! members in 
the area had license plate registration stickers altered, resulting in their 
being pulled over by sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The license plate prank could not be confirmed in Humboldt County, where Sieman 
appeared at the invitation of the loggers group known as Mothers' Watch. Candy 
Boak, a spokeswoman for the group, said Sieman was invited because members 
"wanted to see what we could do to end the terrorism in our community." 
</P>
<P>
Although Earth First! has denied involvement, loggers accuse members and 
sympathizers of responsibility for the injuries a logger suffered in 1987 when 
a saw blade hit a large spike that had been driven into a tree at a Cloverdale 
timber mill. 
</P>
<P>
Boak said Sieman's speech "helped a lot of people decide to fight. When you 
have been the recipient of so many Earth First! tactics it is good to see it 
going the other way. It makes them furious. They don't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Sahara Club also has drawn attention with a variety of publicity stunts. 
</P>
<P>
In September, when a representative of Earth First! was addressing about 200 
people on the campus of California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks, about 
40 Sahara Club members stood in the audience and stripped off outer shirts to 
reveal T-shirts with caricatures of an Earth First! member getting choked and a 
Sierra Club member being "planted" head first in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Sieman said members of his group also infiltrate meetings of environmental 
groups and attempt "sting operations," in which they impersonate members of 
groups such as Earth First! in telephone calls to members of other conservation 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Sahara Club newsletter to members is replete with sarcasm and personal 
attacks on environmentalists, government agencies and public officials. 
</P>
<P>
It recently referred to Sierra Club members as "Nature Nazis" and pondered 
whether they were all on drugs. The publication includes coupons for buying the 
club's "Choke an Earth Firster" T-shirts. And other issues have published the 
names, phone numbers and vehicle descriptions of conservationists, with advice 
to members to watch out for them or call them to express Sahara Club views on 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The same clowns who were warning you about the planet freezing over 20 years 
ago are now babbling about global warming," a recent newsletter editorial said. 
"Hysterical psychobabble and knee-jerk reaction to unproved allegations is now 
starting to dominate the media." 
</P>
<P>
Critics say it's all sophomoric. "They are putting out a lot of rhetoric that 
incites people -- it's a lot of name-calling," said Judy Anderson, a San 
Fernando Valley teacher who is a Sierra Club member and co-director of the 
California Desert Protection League. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody in Sahara Club makes much sense," said Mark Williams, a Los Angeles 
representative of Earth First! who has debated Sieman on a local radio program. 
"They berate people in an adolescent schoolyard manner. They are a very 
paranoid, wacko bunch." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the newsletter gives a group of "nutty guys" a venue for 
espousing racist, homophobic and anti-environmental views. He said many 
environmentalists -- himself included -- have received telephone threats after 
their names and numbers appeared in the newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Sieman denies encouraging threats. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not they are violent, the implication is there," Anderson said. "I 
don't think of the Sahara Club as being benign." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sieman foresees the club shifting toward conventional tactics -- like 
lawsuits -- to effect change, he said its "rowdy" approach is carefully 
planned. "Everything we do -- including the name Sahara Club -- is designed for 
maximum irritation." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Martin, a Sepulveda engineer and one of the so-called "Barstow Five," said 
the club will become "more involved in mainstream issues, legislative issues" 
in the future. He recently set up a Sahara Club computer bulletin board to help 
members exchange information. 
</P>
<P>
Sieman said the organization plans to file a class-action suit against the BLM 
over the closing of the desert to the "B to V" race. Not all off-road 
enthusiasts are aboard, however. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Fuentes, president of the Van Nuys-based Checkers Motorcycle Club, which 
has 75 professional off-road racers as members, said Sieman has spoken to his 
group but picked up few new Sahara Club members. Fuentes said the message may 
be right, but he does not agree with the harsh method of spreading it. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Hillier, manager of BLM's California Desert District, said the Sahara 
Club fails to recognize the need for controls on some desert lands. "They are 
saying, 'Public values be damned. We are not going to be controlled,' " Hillier 
said. "Their views are not as large as they think they are." 
</P>
<P>
Sieman is undismayed. "Remember," he said, "in 1945 the Sierra Club had 4,000 
members. Now, they have over 500,000." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EXCERPTS FROM THE SAHARA CLUB NEWSLETTER 
</P>
<P>
* "Somebody says that Spotted Owls can only live in old growth forests. Then 
they find a pair of them nesting in the rafters of a K mart store, raising a 
chick. Must be an old growth K mart." 
</P>
<P>
* "Remember the big stink raised over the Exxon Valdez oil spill, and how it 
was going to destroy all the wildlife and fish for generations to come? Well, 
all that doomsaying proved to be so much hot air, as the largest catch ever was 
realized in Alaska just recently. . . . The eco-nuts have refused to accept the 
position that the damage was reversible in order to justify their zero-risk 
approach to the environment." 
</P>
<P>
* "ACID RAIN STUDY YIELDS STOMACH ACID TO ECO-FREAKS. Ohh, they've been crying 
and sniveling about acid rain for years now, but a 10-year study concluded: 'If 
there were no change in acid deposition from the current levels, we would 
expect that in the Northeast the chemical status of the lakes would stay 
approximately the same over the next 50 years.' In other words, we have 
squandered yet another titanic sum of money to placate the groundless 
accusations and claims of the Nature Nazis." 
</P>
<P>
* "The eco-nuts always like to quote John Muir, and in fact, base much of their 
movement on his thoughts. . . . Muir was a human-hater and one of the sickest 
screwballs to ever walk the trails. It's only fitting that the Sierra Club 
should look to his immortal words for guidance." 
</P>
<P>
* "BAMBI BIMBOS ON THE MOVE! Deer hunters in Florida will have to deal with 
animal rights fruitcakes in the woods this year, as the protesters plan to 
badger the hunters during a legal state-sponsored deer hunt." 
</P>
<P>
* "Boy oh boy, are we wasting tons of trees on junk mail. Well, guess who is 
the single biggest offender? Right. The eco-freaks! . . . For example, the 
Sierra Club mailed out over 20 million pieces of junk mail. . . . Greenpeace, 
those fun-loving guys who ram ships and support Earth First!, mailed out 47 
million pieces last year."

WILL WRITTEN AND DUFFEL BAG PACKED, A RESERVIST WAITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On paper, John Richards is ready to go to war. Like others in his Van 
Nuys-based Army National Guard unit, he has made out a will. He gave his father 
legal authority over his business affairs. And he keeps a duffel bag packed 
with battle fatigues in his bedroom closet. 
</P>
<P>
But as he waits for a call that may never come, the 40-year-old mortgage banker 
and Vietnam combat veteran questions whether the United States should fight in 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"As a member of the National Guard, I have a duty and a job to perform. But as 
a civilian . . . there are a lot of questions about our political and economic 
motivations that I'm not comfortable with," said Richards, who works for a firm 
headquartered in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
As the United States prepares for possible war with Iraq, Richards and nearly 
1,300 other California National Guard members attached to San Fernando 
Valley-based units await the possibility of being called to active duty -- some 
in eager anticipation, others in anxiety and doubt. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they live with the uncertainty. They go to work each day. And 
play with their children. And follow the news like hawks for each new Persian 
Gulf development -- all the while wondering if they will be spending Christmas 
at home or in a foreign desert. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Guard units, there are several regular Army and Marine 
reserve units stationed in the Valley. Following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of 
Kuwait, about 150 members of an Army reserve well-drilling unit based in Van 
Nuys were sent to the gulf. Sunday and today, 250 members of an Encino-based 
Marine combat reserve unit are also shipping out in support of the gulf 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Since the United States began building up its gulf military forces, only 1,230 
of California's 27,000 Army and Air Force National Guard members have been 
called up in support of Operation Desert Shield.

<P>
Most activated guard members -- trained volunteers usually used in civil 
emergencies but available for wartime service -- have been from Central and 
Northern California. Guard officials refuse to speculate on the chances of 
additional call-ups. So far, no Southern California guard units have been 
alerted that they may be called up. 
</P>
<P>
While they wait, guard members have continued their usual weapons training and 
preparations for responding to chemical attacks. And officials are teaching 
them how to get their domestic affairs in order. 
</P>
<P>
Guard members have been taught how to write wills and prepare powers of 
attorney, legal documents giving their relatives or friends the authority to 
buy and sell property or conduct other business while a reservist is away from 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Dr. Johnson said, 'Knowing you're going to be hanged within 24 hours 
focuses the mind wonderfully,' " said Sgt. Phil Jordan, a Sacramento-based 
National Guard spokesman, referring to Samuel Johnson, 18th-Century English 
writer and critic. 
</P>
<P>
Some Valley-based reservists said the waiting bothers them only because they 
would rather be in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to doing my job," said Michael Shipman, 36, an Army 
National Guard warrant officer who works full time at a vehicle maintenance 
shop in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"I may not get called for the rest of my career. This is my one shot at putting 
it in action and seeing if it actually works," said Shipman, who volunteered 
for Vietnam as a teen-ager only to have his troop ship ordered home before it 
reached Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people are what you call pumped up. . . . Psychologically, our people are 
prepared for it," said Ann Tait, a Southern California Edison accountant who is 
on leave to serve with the Air Force National Guard's 261st Combat 
Communications Squadron in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, regard a future call-up with dread. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not ready to fight this war. I think most of our motives are wrong," said 
Richards, who 20 years ago served as an aerial spotter for artillery and B-52 
bomber strikes in Vietnam's infamous Demilitarized Zone. 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States should not go to war for the sake of protecting oil 
companies and that if Iraq's nuclear capability is to be destroyed, it should 
be done with air strikes, not ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
Richards, of Carpinteria, said he re-enlisted in the National Guard 14 months 
ago because of the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the easing of 
Cold War tensions. The seeming outbreak of peace, he thought, made it unlikely 
the National Guard would ever again be sent into battle abroad. 
</P>
<P>
But now, he said, "I'm back in the National Guard and I'm over 40 and I'm faced 
with going back and fighting a war that I still don't have any vested interest 
in."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 41 MEN ARRESTED IN PROSTITUTION SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police arrested 41 men on prostitution-related charges this weekend in an 
undercover operation in which female police officers posed as prostitutes in 
Pacoima, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The men, ranging in age from 18 to 50, were arrested on suspicion of soliciting 
the women for acts of prostitution. The men received misdemeanor citations and 
were released, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the crackdown, which ran from 5:30 p.m. Saturday until 12:30 a.m. 
Sunday, is part of a continuing effort to keep the area around Kelowna Street 
and San Fernando Road free of prostitutes. Residents in the area complain that 
the prostitutes attract undesirable people into their neighborhoods.

JACK CLARK RIPS PADRE MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First baseman Jack Clark, the man they call the Ripper, decided over the 
weekend he will leave the San Diego Padre organization in style, unleashing a 
vicious verbal attack on Manager Greg Riddoch. 
</P>
<P>
Clark accuses Riddoch of being responsible for many of the organization's 31 
firings over the past 10 weeks, of back-stabbing everyone in his path, of being 
an incompetent manager and an evil person. 
</P>
<P>
He also promises revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"When he gets off his high horse, and gets fired, there'll be nobody to protect 
him," Clark said. "That's when he better start looking over his shoulder where 
there will be a lot of people looking for him. They want a piece of him. 
</P>
<P>
"You make your bed, you lay in it, and if that's the way you want it, you die 
in it. 
</P>
<P>
"Payback's a dog." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch, spending the weekend in Sterling, Colo., was surprised to learn of 
Clark's comments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very disappointing to hear," Riddoch said Sunday, "and it's very, very 
unfair. The hard part to accept is that we've spent so much time together, and 
I considered us friends. But now all of a sudden, I'm supposed to be different, 
I'm conniving, I'm sneaky. 
</P>
<P>
"It just doesn't wash with me. But I'm not going to stoop to his level and get 
into a verbal war. 
</P>
<P>
"All this does is just make you work harder to prove you're a good solid 
person. I'll put my reputation, and whatever I do, on the line." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, one of 16 players who were granted new-look free agency, insists that 
his anger toward Riddoch is not because the Padres no longer are interested in 
signing him. Instead, he says, it is because of the way he believes Riddoch's 
personality changed once he was promoted from first-base coach to manager at 
the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
"Riddoch, my God, there's not enough things I can say about that guy," Clark 
said from his Danville, Calif., home. 
</P>
<P>
But Clark tried anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a bad, bad man," Clark said, "and he's sneaky. He's a snake. Well, not 
just a snake, but a s-s-s-n-n-n-a-ke. 
</P>
<P>
"The crazy thing is that I thought he was a good guy, but once he became 
manager, he turned out to be one of the biggest all-time snakes I've ever seen. 
He'll stab anyone in the back to get to the top. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you, he and (Padre chairman) Tom Werner are a great combo. They deserve 
each other. They're perfect together." 
</P>
<P>
Clark accuses Riddoch of being the man behind many of the club's firings, and 
says that he also is responsible for the firing of Jack McKeon as general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
"He's back-stabbing everyone on his way to the top," Clark said. "Who do you 
think did all of those firings? Who do you think got the trainers fired? Who do 
you think got the coaches fired? Who do you think got McKeon and everyone 
upstairs fired? 
</P>
<P>
"Joe McIlvaine, come on, he doesn't even know these people. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our little buddy, Greggy. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't believe the stuff I've found out about the last couple of months. 
I got information from upper-echelon people in the organization, too. These 
were the people that were sitting in on the meetings, the ones where Riddoch 
was cutting my head off, along with just about everyone else he could think of. 
</P>
<P>
"What he didn't realize was that the people who got fired are talking now. 
These people are singing. I know what he told to Tom Werner, the way he buried 
me, because someone else was in that room, too. I heard everything, and the way 
he's doing the same to three-quarters of the players on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Our little friend, the psychologist, is doing a number on us." 
</P>
<P>
This is why, Clark says, that he soon will begin making phone calls. The 
critical comments that Riddoch made in private meetings with management that 
were relayed to Clark will be disseminated to the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to call Benito Santiago, Ed Whitson, Bruce Hurst, and all the guys 
that he's been calling bums," Clark said. "I'm going to make sure everyone 
understands his little game with him. I'm going to tell them what he's been 
saying about them. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been sugar-coating everyone on top all right, and then blood-sucking you 
on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this a guy you really want to play for?" 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who also was quietly critical of Riddoch's managerial skills during the 
season, along with several veterans, also decided to air his views on this 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy is an absolute joke," Clark said. "He's so overmatched, and the sad 
thing is, the whole team knows he's in over his head. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that tees me off is that we did so much to help him, especially at 
the start when he was a nervous wreck. He asked for all our help, telling us to 
take care of the young guys. But the more we watched him, we knew this guy 
didn't have a clue on what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys on the team have to keep their mouths shut, but everyone in baseball 
knows what a lousy manager he is. They laugh at us. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch, it'll be the same this year. He'll have these kindergarten tactics, 
he'll use all his psychology crap, and he'll try to bully the young players 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
"What it is, is that he's got this little-man syndrome, like we're supposed to 
kneel down in front of him like he's God. But the guy is useless, totally 
useless. 
</P>
<P>
"His best job would be as a minor league coordinator, but for him to manage a 
big-league club is an absolute joke. I feel sorry for everyone who has to stay 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, actually, still remains a member of the Padres himself. Although he is a 
free agent, and is expected to receive serious bids from several clubs such as 
the Boston Red Sox and Philadelphia Phillies, Clark belongs contractually to 
the Padres. If he were to receive no offers, the Padres still would have Clark 
under contract, which would be determined by an arbitration hearing. 
</P>
<P>
But once the Padres made the four-player trade Wednesday with the Toronto Blue 
Jays to acquire first baseman Fred McGriff and shortstop Tony Fernandez, they 
no longer needed his services. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter because of the trades or the players they 
let go," Clark said. "I think Fred McGriff and Fernandez are fabulous players. 
I think it was a good move by Joe McIlvaine to get guys like that. I respect a 
man for having the guts to pull off a trade like that. 
</P>
<P>
"But they're going backwards with a guy like Riddoch, and the sooner off they 
realize it, the better off they'll be."

RAM HOPE ENDS ON THE 9-YARD LINE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: WITH TIME EXPIRED, THEY ARE GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE TO BEAT THE 
SAINTS. THEY DON'T, LOSING 24-20, TO FALL TO 5-8.

<P>
On the brink of arm-wrestling their way back into playoff relevence Sunday, the 
Rams found themselves once again one play short and tumbling back into their 
season-long 1990 nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
And like all recurring bad dreams, the Rams' 24-20 loss to the New Orleans 
Saints was full of just-missed opportunities, mini-victories that evaporated 
and a slew grandiose, frozen-in-time failures before an Anaheim Stadium crowd 
of 56,864. 
</P>
<P>
Funny how one tricky three-hour game can have so many parts, but these 
tragedy-in-the-making Rams probably couldn't have done it any other way. Why 
have a nightmare if it can't be shared by millions? 
</P>
<P>
This was a loss that finally and irreversibly knocks the Rams (5-8) out of any 
logical playoff scenario, no matter what those calculator-cranking 
mathematicians may say. 
</P>
<P>
This was a loss that shouldn't have been, a loss that was handed away when the 
Rams (who had 24 first downs to the Saints' nine) seemed to be at last 
capturing their nerve and ability to win close games. 
</P>
<P>
This was a loss that had tailback Cleveland Gary talking plainly about the 
unlikely possibility of being waived after his two lost fumbles gave New 
Orleans renewed life, and left quarterback Jim Everett dead-eyed and unable to 
come up with explanations. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this loss kills us," Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a loss that is probably best recalled in slow motion, because that's how 
the pivotal moments of the Rams' undoing seemed to unravel -- especially the 
last 33 seconds of the game, which played out like 33 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three seconds full of sound, fury and mass confusion, signifying the end 
of the Ram season. Perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our chance," Everett said, "and we just couldn't make the plays." 
</P>
<P>
After a combination of blown defensive assignments and a key Gary fumble -- his 
11th of the season and fifth in four games -- had allowed the Saints to erase a 
10-point fourth-quarter deficit and pull ahead, 24-20, the Rams still had a 
chance to pull it out. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Everett, they got all the way to the Saint six-yard line, needing a 
touchdown with those 33 seconds left in the game to do it and, due to some 
offensive confusion, zero timeouts. The Rams could have had close to 40 seconds 
if they hadn't delayed so long calling their last timeout. Everett said he was 
waiting for a signal from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
On second and goal from the six, Everett was sacked by linebacker Pat Swilling 
for a 10-yard loss. On the next play, with 21 seconds to play, Everett, under a 
big rush, hit Pete Holohan for three meaningless yards to the 13, where the 
Rams got the worst of both worlds: the clock would have stopped on an 
incomplete pass or if Holohan could've gotten out of bounds, but neither 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get in there, but (there were) a lot of their guys in the end 
zone, too," Rams Coach John Robinson said, explaining why the Rams never took a 
shot at the end zone. "Just couldn't find anybody, and were forced to come off 
(to short-yardage opportunities). Obviously, the rush was a problem for us 
coming around. . . . The rush was coming around, and he was trying to find 
somebody. I just think he just couldn't see anybody in the end zone that had a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Fourth down, and the clock churned on down to 10 . . . eight. . . five . . . 
one. . . . The Rams were in a frenzy to line up for their last shot, the Saints 
chaotically trying to set up for the last stand. And, somewhat remarkably, 
Everett got the snap off just in time, dropped the ball and watched Saint 
linebacker Vaughan Johnson recover it. 
</P>
<P>
But wait -- linebacker Rickey Jackson, in the melee, was offsides, and the Rams 
had one more chance from the nine (the penalty, for some reason, was of four 
yards), because the game cannot end on a defensive penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure there was confusion, but they were just as confused on defense as we 
were," Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
One last chance to jump into the wild-card race, because both Green Bay and the 
Vikings had already lost, meaning the Rams could have been tied for the last 
spot with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, a slow-motion nightmare: Everett dropped back, saw nothing, then saw 
Jackson bearing in and wobbled an off-balance, no-chance pass five feet short 
of Buford McGee to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
There were no offsides calls this time, no penalties at all. Just the end. 
</P>
<P>
"Our errors cost us the game," Robinson said. "I felt we would score down 
there, especially when we got the second chance." 
</P>
<P>
That drive was just symptomatic of a game the Rams basically dominated, except 
for a handful of plays. Their defense stopped the Saints consistently -- until 
running back Gill Fenerty ripped off a 60-yard touchdown past safety Vince 
Newsome to get the Saints to within 20-17 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a crushing blow," Newsome said. "Without a doubt, we played great 
defense as a team today. But the plays we did break down on hurt us, hurt us 
bad. I missed the tackle, and that seemed to turn the game around." 
</P>
<P>
The Ram offense controlled things -- until the collection of Gary's fumbles, a 
disastrous third-quarter Everett interception that resulted in a 50-yard 
touchdown return by Brett Maxie and the final failure spun the game out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans' offense, mostly, was the Rams' talent for crucial mistakes, 
highlighted by Gary, who had a quiet talk with Robinson at his locker after the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Gary's first fumble was indisputable and very costly: As he was trying to crash 
in for a touchdown, Gary lost the ball at the one-yard line when inside 
linebacker Sam Mills hit him low. The ball rolled into the end zone, where 
safety Gene Atkins recovered it. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson kept Gary in there, all the way into fourth quarter, until the 
second play after Fenerty had closed it to 20-17. Gary ran off left tackle, 
scrambled through a hole, then seemed to hit the ground before the ball 
squeezed loose. The officials, who at first ruled nothing, decided it was a 
fumble that the Saints had recovered, and the replay official could find no 
angle that proved otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
The second fumble gave the Saints the ball at the Ram 42, and soon enough 
quarterback Steve Walsh had put New Orleans ahead to stay by hitting receiver 
Eric Martin from four yards out. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question in my mind that if I don't fumble, we win the game," Gary 
said. "This is definitely the worst I've ever experienced. Fumbling's a no-no, 
that's the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm willing to accept my future, whatever it is. I don't know if the Rams are 
going to cut me tomorrow or what, but I'll face it. The point is, I'm fumbling. 
I'm trying my best, but I'm fumbling, and obviously, it's hurting this team." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson defended Gary after the game, argued that the second fumble wasn't a 
fumble, and there is little chance Gary isn't a key member of this team for the 
duration. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, Gary admits that he is no help. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter if you're leading the league in touchdowns (which he was), 
all people point to is the negatives," Gary said. "And unfortunately, I'm 
leading the league in fumbles. Being aggressive is what has gotten me to this 
level, and this season, it's also gotten me into a lot of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes

Running back Marcus Dupree was the only Ram on the injury report, suffering a 
broken nose in the first quarter, but he returned to action.

MIKE DOWNEY: WAITING IS A PART OF GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Tyson is back, leaner and meaner. When he punched Alex Stewart in the 
stomach Saturday night, it was like squeezing a Hostess Twinkie and then 
watching the filling squirt out. Should Tyson ever pump Gorging George 
Foreman's stomach that way, heaven help the people at ringside. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no Tyson-Foreman fight, however -- not now, perhaps never. And 
whose fault is that? 
</P>
<P>
Not George's. 
</P>
<P>
At any time Tyson held the heavyweight title, he could have afforded Foreman a 
shot at the championship belt. He did not. He did defend the title 10 times, 
not counting the night he beat the stuffing out of a turkey named Mitch Green 
on a Harlem sidewalk, so Tyson was hardly in hiding. But the only chance he 
ever gave old George Foreman was the chance to get even older. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the new ring king, Evander Holyfield, at considerable risk to his 
reputation and face, is willing to accommodate Foreman, who intends to let out 
a few notches in that championship belt as soon as he wins it back. Holyfield, 
while undefeated professionally, is a boxer whose skull got punching-bagged for 
13 rounds by the very same Alex Stewart who just got Tysonized at Atlantic 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson and his handlers are beefing that their fighter deserves the next shot at 
the championship, that Holyfield has no right to be ducking him, that Tyson is 
the obvious No. 1 contender. Well, of course he is. Anybody who could get two 
eyelids open on the night Tyson lost to Buster Douglas must have noticed that 
not only was Tyson unprepared, but he still floored Buster and nearly won the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
All we can advise Tyson, though, is to be patient. To wait, the way he made 
Foreman wait. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson is a young man, a couple of decades younger than old George. Tyson is so 
young, his voice hasn't changed yet. He has time to kill. Opponents, well, he 
can maim them later. Or, he can step through the ropes with Donovan (Razor) 
Ruddock, the way he had contractually committed to a year ago in Edmonton, and 
stop reneging on Razor, rather than complaining that Holyfield is side-stepping 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the sporting public wants to see Foreman fight somebody important, 
while he still can. While some still consider Foreman's senior-league pugilism 
a farce, others have been won over by this happy-go-lucky lug who trains on 
hot-fudge sundaes. George has turned boxing into the Sweet 'n' Low Science. 
</P>
<P>
As a former keeper of the crown, same as Tyson, there is just enough touch of 
boxing royalty in Foreman that we should indulge one last whim. Besides, he is 
big fun. And anyway, could Foreman do worse than Buster Douglas did against 
Holyfield? Do worse than Alex Stewart did Saturday? Does Foreman's advanced age 
make him less worthy an opponent or attraction than Henry Tillman for a guy 
such as Tyson? 
</P>
<P>
It will disturb, but won't kill, Tyson to be kept on hold while Holyfield 
brings the Foreman comeback to a boil. We have seen George play patty-cake with 
an assortment of Bozos, yo-yos and morgue escapees, and the time has come to 
end his career or enhance it. No sense waiting until Foreman is 50 and drinking 
Geritol from his squirt bottle. Let's get on with it. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Foreman will win. Then he can fight Tyson, a bout Don King undoubtedly 
will promote as "Mike and the Fat Man." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it is good to have Tyson back, fighting like his old self. He 
looks hungry again, and scary, and vicious, and eager to reclaim his status as 
undisputed champion of any dispute. This is the angriest we have seen Mike 
since he was married.

<P>
Tyson should honor his commitment to fight Ruddock. After all, he backed away 
from that fight because he contracted pneumonia, and unless Tyson can prove 
that it was Ruddock who gave him the pneumonia, it behooves him to reschedule 
the fight. Holyfield was available then and Tyson elected to fight Ruddock 
instead; now the shoe is on the other foot, and Mikey doesn't like it. 
</P>
<P>
There are people in boxing circles who contend that the contender Ruddock is 
tougher than the champion Holyfield. Much like Buster Douglas, Holyfield hopes 
to milk his title for a few months for whatever it's worth, and that's fine. It 
also is to his credit that he is fighting Foreman, although punching one in the 
snout is a peculiar way of showing respect for one's elder. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tyson can occupy his spare hours helping Spike Lee with the film that 
distinguished director is making about him. It will be a sockumentary, 
chronicling the rise and fall of one of the most fearless customers ever to 
give or take a punch. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson will rise again to the title; that's the safest wager in sports. From 
whom will he win it? Well, that depends on how Foreman makes out. You know. 
Survival of the fattest.

Germany's Gunda Kleeman set a world record in the women's 3,000 meters in a 
World Cup speedskating meet at Calgary, breaking the mark set by her long-time

than a second better than the mark of 4:11.94 set by Van Gennip, a triple gold 
medalist at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics. Van Gennip finished third in

CHIEFS PLACE THIS ONE IN THE PERSONAL COLUMN; 
</P>
<P>
AFC: THEY GIVE SCHOTTENHEIMER HIS FIRST VICTORY OVER THE BRONCOS AFTER SIX 
DEFEATS, 31-20.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marty Schottenheimer insisted it was nothing personal, but his Kansas City 
Chiefs saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
After Steve DeBerg threw three touchdowns passes Sunday to lead a 31-20 victory 
over the Denver Broncos, the Chiefs all but dedicated the victory to 
Schottenheimer and his coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing said, but you could sense all week that this was a special 
one, and you know why it was special," linebacker Dino Hackett said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all grown very close to this coaching staff. We wanted it for ourselves 
and for our team, sure. But it was nice to get it for them, too. They had 
suffered some tough losses to those guys, some heart-breaking losses." 
</P>
<P>
Schottenheimer and several of his assistants came into the game 0-6 against 
Denver, including two last-minute losses in the AFC title game while he was in 
charge of the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
He finally broke through in his 100th game as a head coach as the Chiefs (9-4) 
moved a half-game ahead of the Raiders, who play at Detroit tonight, in the AFC 
West. 
</P>
<P>
"It has nothing to do with the personal thing," Schottenheimer said. "Personal 
things don't mean a lot in this game." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the fourth in a row and fifth in six games for the Chiefs, 
while the defending AFC champion Broncos (3-10) lost their sixth consecutive 
game, their longest losing streak loss since a nine-game slide in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the eighth time this season the Broncos lost after leading at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"The typical things that seem to happen all year," Denver Coach Dan Reeves 
said. "We are ahead at halftime and we come out and lose the game. They did an 
excellent job of executing their game plan." 
</P>
<P>
John Elway directed Denver to two touchdowns after the Chiefs took a 7-0 lead 
on their first possession. 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg connected with Stephone Paige for 49-yard touchdown on the fifth play of 
the game when Kansas City fooled the Broncos with a flea-flicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was a touchdown coming out of the huddle," Paige said. "The play had 
been clicking so beautifully in practice, and then I saw we had exactly the 
kind of coverage we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Elway got the Broncos the lead when he threw a five-yard touchdown pass to 
Shannon Sharpe and connected with Michael Young on a 16-yard scoring play. 
Kansas City's Nick Lowery kicked a 33-yard field goal, his 14th without a miss, 
to make it 13-10 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Elway had the Broncos driving in the third quarter, but Hackett recovered 
Shannon Sharpe's fumble to turn the game around. Eight plays later Barry Word 
scored on fourth-and-goal from the one to put the Chiefs ahead for good, 17-13. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I got the ball to secure it, I got hit and dropped the ball," 
Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
It was 24-20 in the final minutes when, on fourth down, DeBerg threw a short 
pass to Robb Thomas, who turned it into a 27-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little surprised on fourth and three that they went for it," Elway 
said. "It was a bold move and a great call." 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg, a 15-year veteran who completed 18 of 27 passes for 254 yards, did not 
have a pass intercepted for the eighth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
He was not surprised by Schottenheimer's decision to go for it on 
fourth-and-three from the 27 with a little more than 2:50 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it showed confidence in our football team," DeBerg said. "To be 
honest, I thought we'd go for it. If I was the one making the call, I would 
have gone for it. If we make the first down, the game's over. If we make a 
touchdown the game's really over." 
</P>
<P>
Elway completed 24 of 36 passes for 328 yards and two touchdowns to keep the 
Broncos in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Denver got a scare in the second half when Elway went down with what appeared 
to be a knee injury, but he stayed in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Schottenheimer: "Everybody talks about John Elway and his great ability, 
but the one thing that people don't talk about is the single most important 
thing -- that he is as fine a competitor as I have ever seen play this game."

SPOTLIGHT / A GLANCE AT THIS WEEK IN THE NFL; 
</P>
<P>
CAN'T KEEP HIM DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All season, Bill Parcells has asked the New York Giants' walking wounded to 
play hurt. On Sunday, he did the same himself after spending Saturday night in 
a hospital with kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
"When you give those bumps-and-bruises guys the message that we need you today 
and not in three weeks, you'd better do the same yourself," said Parcells, who 
checked himself back into Morristown Memorial Hospital after his team's 23-15 
victory over Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would remain there "a day or two." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Erhardt, the Giants' offensive coordinator, said Parcells was stricken 
before a coaches meeting at 8:30 Saturday night and checked himself into the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He was let out Sunday morning on what Betty Mills, a nursing supervisor at the 
hospital, called "a pass to go to the game." 
</P>
<P>
Parcells didn't come out for his team's pregame warmup but spent the entire 
game on the sideline, at one point getting into a spirited discussion with 
officials after a fumble by Minnesota's Rich Gannon went out of bounds 12 yards 
from where it was lost. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't an argument," he said after the game, his facing appearing drawn and 
pale. "I just wanted to make sure they knew the rules and didn't give them the 
extra yardage on the fumble." 
</P>
<P>
Parcells' presence had a clear effect on his players. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our leader. He's like a father," linebacker Johnie Cooks said. "When you 
don't have your leader, you don't know which way to go." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they told everybody about it," fullback Maurice Carthon said. 
"They told me and told me to keep it quiet. I saw him this morning and he was 
hurting. But he said all week that guys who are hurting have to come back. He 
came out and proved that. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the type of people we have on this team." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RUSTY RETURN 
</P>
<P>
Dexter Manley, suspended for a year by the NFL after three violations of the 
league's substance abuse policy, made his return Sunday with the Phoenix 
Cardinals in a 23-14 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel grateful to be back where I belong," said Manley, a defensive end, who 
played only in passing situations. 
</P>
<P>
Manley made his first appearance with just under six minutes left in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"He was like a racehorse before the game," Phoenix Coach Joe Bugel said. "He 
wanted to get some snaps and we wanted to get him in the game as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad he played. He's sitting in his locker right now, and feels he 
accomplished something." 
</P>
<P>
Manley, 31, who had 87 sacks in eight seasons with the Washington Redskins, 
didn't get any Sunday, nor was he credited with any tackles. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was a little rusty." he said. "At times I played good and it was 
exciting. I thought I hustled well, although I didn't play all that well. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy to be back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Ram running back Marcus Dupree suffered torn cartilage in his nose during the 
first quarter, but returned for special teams duty at the start of the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati secondary suffered another major setback when safety Rickey 
Dixon broke his leg in the fourth quarter. The team said Dixon broke his right 
fibula on the 29-yard pass play from Joe Montana to Jerry Rice that started San 
Francisco's drive to the game-tying field goal. Cornerback Lewis Billups also 
missed several plays after aggravating a sprained ankle late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
New York's Ottis Anderson became the eighth back in NFL history to rush for 
10,000 yards. Anderson gained 26 yards in 15 carries and has 10,012 in his 
career. He also scored two touchdowns, the 78th and 79th of his career, putting 
him alone in seventh place. He had been tied with Tony Dorsett and he is now 
three shy of former Packer Jim Taylor. . . . The Vikings, who had a winning 
streak ended at five games, now have lost 14 of their last 15 games outdoors, 
including eight in a row. Minnesota is 20-2 indoors during the same period. . . 
. Bill Parcells is now 10-0 at home versus NFC Central teams. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland has allowed 30 or more points five consecutive weeks. . . . Houston 
leads the NFL in third-down efficiency. The Oilers converted six of 10 against 
the Browns, giving them 77 of 143 for the season. . . . Eric Metcalf's 101-yard 
kickoff return was the longest against the Oilers in franchise history. The 
previous record was 100 yards by two players, Buffalo's Art Baker in 1962 and 
Denver's Goldie Sellers in 1966. . . . Warren Moon, who has 310 completions 
this year, broke the team record of 293, set by Ken Stabler in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay rushed for 13 yards, four fewer than the previous club low of 17 set 
against Boston in 1933. The Packers had only 10 carries, the fewest since they 
ran the ball only 11 times against the Bears two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have won 17 consecutive games on the road, extending their NFL 
record. . . . . . . San Francisco's Roger Craig caught three passes to match 
Dwight Clark's club record of 506 career catches. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh has shut out seven of its last nine opponents in the second half. . 
. . New England has been outrushed 2,066 to 1,104 and allowed an opposing back 
to rush for 100 yards for the seventh consecutive game and the 10th time in 13 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta wide receiver Andre Rison became only the fourth Falcon to have more 
than 1,000 receiving yards in a season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BIG PLAYS 
</P>
<P>
Brad Muster's fumble set up Washington's Chip Lohmiller for a 35-yard field 
goal with 2:14 remaining as the Redskins defeated the Bears, 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana completed three passes to Jerry Rice on the first possession of 
overtime, setting up Mike Cofer's 23-yard field goal, giving San Francisco a 
20-17 victory over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Stoyanovich's 34-yard field goal with three seconds left forced an 
overtime, and his 39-yarder with 2:28 to go in sudden death lifted the Miami 
Dolphins past the Philadelphia Eagles, 23-20. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WILD, WILD CENTRAL 
</P>
<P>
It is a cold winter in Southern California when someone runs away with the AFC 
Central title. With Pittsburgh and Houston winning Sunday and Cincinnati losing 
to San Francisco, the division is a three-team standoff on paper at 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers, however, remain longshots to win the division title. If the 
Steelers tie with Cincinnati, the Bengals would advance as division champions 
because they've beaten Pittsburgh twice. The Steelers beat the Oilers earlier 
and finish the regular season in Houston on Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's victory over Green Bay damaged the Steelers' hopes of advancing to 
the expanded playoffs as a wild card. Seattle, Houston and Pittsburgh are 
currently tied for the third and final wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati safety David Fulcher on the Bengals' overtime loss to San Francisco: 
"We beat that team. It goes the same way again. We beat them and then we give 
it up. We've got to do something to stop people from doing what they do to us 
late in the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland linebacker Clay Matthews after 58-14 loss to Houston: "You figure a 
team can't lose this bad unless people are quitting. But I disagree. I think we 
had a great effort. They just beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 Giant quarterback Phil Simms on 23-15 victory over Minnesota: "We played it 
pretty close to the vest all game. It was a little cautious, but it turned out 
to be the right choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota quarterback Rich Gannon on Lawrence Taylor: "He's relentless. He's a 
one-man wrecking crew and he took over in the fourth quarter. We just couldn't 
stop him. Every time I turned around, he was in my face." 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay quarterback Blair Kiel, who had a big game coming off the bench in 
20-14 loss to Seattle, but missed on a fourth-down, fourth-quarter pass in the 
end zone: "I was in a no-lose situation with nothing to lose and everything to 
gain. I'll probably dream about that last play. It was there, I think. When I 
look at the film, I'll probably puke." 
</P>
<P>
New England Coach Rod Rust after the Patriots' 11th loss in a row: "It's 
inevitable this is going to end, but when is certainly a big question. I'm not 
going make any more remarks about it because I'm tired of hearing about it and 
tired of talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis Coach Ron Meyer on a 31-7 loss to Buffalo: "I said all week the 
Bills were the best team in football at the moment. We did absolutely nothing 
to disprove that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OH YOU KIEL 
</P>
<P>
"Kiel, Kiel, Kiel." That was the chant going up from County Stadium in 
Milwaukee as Green Bay quarterback Anthony Dilweg struggled against Seattle. He 
completed only six of 22 passes for 69 yards and missed on 10 in a row during 
one stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Blair Kiel relieved and completed 23 of 31 passes for 198 yards after not 
having played in two seasons. The Packers, however, came up short against the 
Seahawks, 20-14. 
</P>
<P>
"One minute they love you, one minute they hate you. That's part of the 
business," Dilweg said. "It goes in one ear and out the other." 
</P>
<P>
Kiel, who has been mostly a spectator as the Packers' No. 3 quarterback, says 
he was just glad to have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get involved in the quarterback derby and I know (Coach) Lindy 
(Infante) doesn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, I just filled in in a relief role and if Anthony is 
healthy, I think he'll probably be the starter (next week)." 
</P>
<P>
Dilweg has started the last three games while Don Majkowski's sore shoulder 
heals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOW BLOWS 
</P>
<P>
The New England Patriots have lost 11 consecutive games. They aren't delivering 
many shots these days, but they're certainly taking some from opposing running 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kansas City's Barry Word had the last word, saying the Patriots' 
defenders avoided contact and were soft hitters. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers' Tim Worley made several similar comments Sunday, despite fumbling 
twice while running for 83 yards in a 24-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't like to hit you up there (the upper body)," Worley said. "Maybe 
it's because they've won one game, maybe that has something to do with that. 
Their secondary's not that big to begin with and they won't really try to take 
a shot at you . . . They'll kind of side-step you. 
</P>
<P>
"They were kind of diving at your feet. It seemed like they just don't want to 
tackle you real hard." 
</P>

It keeps happening to the Cincinnati Bengals, but they're not getting used to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana's passes to Jerry Rice set up Mike Cofer's game-tying field goal 
with 57 seconds left in regulation and Cofer's kick in overtime that gave the 
San Francisco 49ers a 20-17 victory over the Bengals Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals' last four games against the 49ers have wound up last-minute 
losses, including the Super Bowl two years ago, when Montana starred in a 
decisive 92-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat that team," Cincinnati safety David Fulcher said. "It goes the same 
way again. We beat them and then we give it up. We've got to do something to 
stop people from doing what they do to us late in the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers (12-1) were trailing, 17-14, when they got the ball with 4:11 left in 
regulation. Montana passed to Rice for a 29-yard gain on the first play and 
drove them to Cofer's game-tying 23-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers won the toss and took possession at their 19 at the start of 
overtime. Montana connected with Rice with passes of 14 and 17 yards to cross 
midfield, and converted a third-and-six situation with a seven-yard pass to 
Rice to help set up Cofer's game-winning 23-yard field goal two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
"We play our best football when everything's on the line," said Rice, who had 
eight catches for 101 yards. "Once we got the ball, I knew we were going to 
score." 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals (7-6), who seemingly took control of the AFC Central Division by 
beating Pittsburgh twice in the last three weeks, fell back into a three-way 
tie for the lead with the Steelers and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Sam Wyche wasn't in a mood to talk, cutting short his post-game press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting tired," Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals have lost their last seven against the 49ers, including their 20-16 
Super Bowl defeat two years ago on Montana's pass to John Taylor with 34 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the last time they met in the regular season, the Bengals failed to 
run out the clock, leaving Montana time for one play -- a scoring pass to Rice 
to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
These last-minute losses may be getting old to Wyche, but Montana, his former 
pupil, enjoyed the repeat ending. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the world of Sam," Montana said. "It's like beating your best friend. 
You know how he feels, but in a lot of cases there's nobody you like beating 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Ickey Woods' one-yard touchdown run put Cincinnati ahead, 17-14, with 12:26 
left, and the Bengals forced the 49ers to punt on their next possession. 
However, Boomer Esiason and the Cincinnati offense couldn't score again, giving 
Montana one last chance. 
</P>
<P>
Montana completed 19 of 26 passes for 185 yards. On the tying and winning 
drives, he took advantage of the absence of safety Rickey Dixon, who suffered a 
broken leg in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco also revived its ground game, with Roger Craig gaining 97 yards 
in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 49ers' 17th consecutive victory on the road, extending their NFL 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Esiason threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Craig Taylor on the Bengals' first 
possession, but they couldn't find the end zone again until Woods' score. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Rathman's one-yard touchdown run got the 49ers even, 7-7, but the Bengals 
regained the lead on Jim Breech's 38-yard field goal in the third quarter after 
Esiason's 20-yard scoring pass to James Brooks was nullified by an illegal 
motion penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers regained the lead, 14-10, on Harry Sydney's three-yard touchdown run 
late in the third quarter.

GIANTS WIN WITH A GAME PLAN TRIED AND TRUE;

NFC: AFTER TWO DEFEATS FOLLOWING 10 CONSECUTIVE VICTORIES, THEY GO BACK TO 
BASICS, BEAT VIKINGS, 23-15.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After losing two consecutive games, the New York Giants went back to the 
formula that gave them victories in their first 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants used a conservative offense, an opportunistic defense and big plays 
on special teams to score a 23-15 victory Sunday over the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
"We played it pretty close to the vest all game," Phil Simms said. "It was a 
little cautious, but it turned out to be the right choice." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants (11-2) wrapped up their second consecutive NFC East title. The 
Vikings' (6-7) winning streak ended at five games, and they lost their eighth 
consecutive game outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
It was typical of several victories by the Giants earlier in the season. They 
struggled at times, but stayed close and didn't take the lead for good until 
Ottis Anderson's two-yard touchdown run made it 20-15 with 6:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Bahr added an 18-yard field goal for the Giants with 33 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always felt that if we could stay and hang in there, that anything could 
happen," said Anderson, who gained 26 yards in 15 carries and become the NFL's 
eighth rusher to gain 10,000 in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Giants' Coach Bill Parcells was on the sidelines despite spending the night in 
a hospital with kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' defense forced three turnovers in the second half and set up all 13 
of New York's points in the fourth quarter. Lawrence Taylor had 2 1/2 sacks and 
set up Gary Reasons' interception late in the game with a big rush on 
quarterback Rich Gannon. 
</P>
<P>
"At halftime we knew we hadn't played any football, and we were only down two 
points," said Taylor, who had nine tackles and three assists. "We knew were 
just 30 minutes away from a title." 
</P>
<P>
New York struggled on offense for the third consecutive week. The Giants had 
one sustained drive, their other four scores being set by a punt return and big 
plays from the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 15-10, after three quarters, the Giants rallied. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Jackson intercepted a bad pass by Gannon at the Vikings' 37 on the first 
play of the fourth quarter and returned it five yards. Bahr kicked a 
wind-aided, 48-yard field goal four plays later to close the gap to, 15-13, 
with 13:40 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings got the ball back at their 18 and lost eight yards on three plays. 
Dave Meggett returned Harry Newsome's punt 11 yards to the Vikings' 42. Eight 
plays later, the Giants got the lead on Anderson's second touchdown of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The big plays in the go-ahead drive were a 16-yard pass from Simms to Stephen 
Baker and an 11-yard run by Rodney Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor then forced the interception as the Vikings tried to rally, setting up 
Bahr's last-minute field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"(Taylor) was the difference in this game," Gannon said. "He's relentless. He's 
a one-man wrecking crew, and he took over in the fourth quarter. We just 
couldn't stop him. Every time I turned around, he was in my face." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota scored early when Chris Doleman sacked Simms for a safety two plays 
after Newsome's 48-yard punt rolled dead at the Giants' two-yard-line. 
</P>
<P>
Fuad Reveiz stretched the lead to 5-0 with a 21-yard field goal on the ensuing 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Meggett's 58-yard kickoff return led to Bahr's 36-yard field goal, but Alfred 
Anderson's one-yard scoring run gave Minnesota a 12-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Ottis Anderson's one-yard scoring run made it 12-10 at halftime.

SEATTLE DOESN'T WAIT UNTIL FINAL SECOND, 20-14; 
</P>
<P>
INTERCONFERENCE: AFTER FOUR GAMES DECIDED ON LAST PLAY, SEAHAWKS FINISH OFF 
PACKERS WITH A MINUTE LEFT.

For once, the Seattle Seahawks had time to spare. 
</P>
<P>
After four consecutive games decided on the final play, the Seahawks stopped 
the Green Bay Packers with one minute left to escape with a 20-14 victory 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of tough, but I'll take those (wins)," Seattle Coach Chuck Knox said 
after the Seahawks (7-6) won for the fourth time in five weeks to strengthen 
their playoff chances. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers (6-7) trailed, 20-0, but rallied for two touchdowns in the final 
quarter behind third-string quarterback Blair Kiel, who hadn't thrown a pass in 
an NFL game since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
When Seattle's Nesby Glasgow fumbled away a kickoff to Green Bay's Herman 
Fontenot, Kiel moved Green Bay to the Seahawks' 12 with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Kiel, playing his first game since Nov. 13, 1988, threw two incompletions, was 
stopped after a four-yard gain on a quarterback draw and threw incomplete again 
on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
"The first three quarters our defense played well and then Blair came in and 
sparked the team," Seattle linebacker Dave Ahrens said. "The receivers got open 
and he got the ball to them. It's hard to defend when you have guys wide open 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay was held to a club-record-low 13 yards rushing in a club-record-low 
10 carries. Trailing, 17-0, at the half, the Packers were forced to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Kiel, who replaced struggling Anthony Dilweg late in the third quarter, hit 
Perry Kemp for a 13-yard touchdown pass play with 5:35 left and connected with 
Ed West on a one-yard scoring pass two minutes later after Green Bay's Bryce 
Paup recovered an onside kick. 
</P>
<P>
Kiel, who completed 23 of 31 passes for 198 yards, connected on passes to 
Jackie Harris and Michael Haddix to get the Packers close the last time before 
losing his touch, missing Jeff Query in the end zone on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a no-lose situation with nothing to lose and everything to gain," 
said Kiel, who often has been inactive for Packers games the last two seasons 
behind Dilweg and Don Majkowski. "I'll probably dream about that last play. It 
was there, I think. When I look at the film, I'll probably puke." 
</P>
<P>
Kiel was in uniform against Seattle to back up Dilweg with Majkowski unable to 
play because of a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle dominated the first half when it held the Packers without a rushing 
yard and outgained Green Bay, 198-65, in total yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was time to suck it up if we wanted to win," Seattle defensive end 
Jeff Bryant said of the finish. "We had control of the game early and it just 
wouldn't have seemed right to let it go at that point. We needed the game as 
bad as they did and the momentum was shifting their way." 
</P>
<P>
Dilweg threw 10 consecutive incompletions during one stretch and connected on 
only six of 20 passes for 69 yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
When Dilweg missed his first two passes in the third quarter, the crowd began 
to chant for Kiel. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks built their 17-0 lead in the first half on Dave Krieg's eight-yard 
touchdown pass to Jeff Chadwick, Derrick Fenner's 14-yard scoring run and a 
37-yard field goal by Norm Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Krieg completed 11 of 18 passes for 133 yards and set up Fenner's touchdown on 
a 43-yard pass play to Chadwick. 
</P>
<P>
Fenner rushed for 112 yards in 20 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson made it 20-0 with a 22-yard field goal in the third quarter before the 
Packers turned to Kiel.

CARDINALS' BIG-PLAY DEFENSE KEYS VICTORY, 24-13; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: MACK AND TURNER MAKE THE DIFFERENCE FOR SECOND WEEK IN A ROW AS PHOENIX 
BEATS ATLANTA.

<P>
For the second consecutive week, Phoenix Cardinal defensive backs Cedric Mack 
and Marcus Turner made big plays to key a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mack set up the go-ahead touchdown with an interception and Turner returned an 
interception 47 yards for a clinching touchdown as the Cardinals beat the 
Atlanta Falcons, 24-13, Sunday for their third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Both were big plays," Mack said. "When Marcus made his I knew it was over." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, in a 20-17 victory over Indianapolis, Mack intercepted a 
fourth-quarter pass by Jeff George and lateraled to Turner, who ran 21 yards 
for the go-ahead touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Both interceptions against the Falcons (3-10) were made on passes by Scott 
Campbell, making his first start in place of Chris Miller, who suffered a 
broken right collarbone last week at Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Mack picked off Campbell's pass at the Phoenix 36 and returned it 39 yards, 
where laterals to Jay Taylor and Turner added seven yards to the return to the 
Falcons' 18. 
</P>
<P>
It took the Cardinals (5-8) five plays to score, with Anthony Thompson running 
it in from the one less than five minutes into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson rushed for 96 yards in 26 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Turner's return came with 4:51 remaining, giving the Cardinals an 11-point 
cushion that ensured the Falcons' sixth consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I just made a perfect read and it was there," Turner said of his touchdown. 
"The defense was putting a lot of pressure on them and you could see they were 
getting frustrated. That was to our advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Coach Jerry Glanville said his team didn't play like it has in recent 
weeks, when the Falcons were in games to the end. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the first Sunday where we stepped the wrong way," Glanville 
said. "We didn't prove we were better than last week. We are fortunate that we 
have three games left to prove we can get better." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix drove 83 yards for a second-quarter touchdown, scoring on a 45-yard 
pass play from Timm Rosenbach to Ricky Proehl. Rosenbach, who completed 15 of 
29 passes for 227 yards, completed three passes for 78 yards in the drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals also got a 37-yard field goal from Al Del Greco on the final play 
of the first half, when Atlanta was charged with encroachment, stopping the 
clock on fourth down with one second left. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta cut its deficit to 17-13 when Greg Davis kicked a 24-yard field goal 
with 9:30 left, capping a 73-yard drive that started on a 29-yard pass play 
from Campbell to Michael Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
Davis also had a 41-yard field goal less than four minutes into the game after 
Bobby Butler recovered a fumble by Thompson on the Phoenix 48. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's 57-yard touchdown drive in the second quarter lasted only two plays 
after Deion Sanders returned a kickoff 39 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Keith Jones, who passed for four touchdowns at Illinois, threw to 
wide receiver Andre Rison for 37-yard play to the Cardinals' 20. On the next 
play, Campbell hooked up with Gary Wilkins just beyond the line of scrimmage 
and Wilkins ran into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Rison had three catches for 65 yards and has 71 receptions for 1,059 yards this 
season. He is only the fourth Falcon ever to have more than 1,000 receiving 
yards in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Dexter Manley saw action for the Cardinals on passing situations, 
his first playing time since being suspended last year for a third violation of 
the NFL's substance abuse policy.

AFTER FOUR SEASONS, FENERTY LEARNS HE BELONGS IN THE NFL; 
</P>
<P>
SAINTS: RUNNING BACK GREW UP IN NEW ORLEANS, BUT HE PLAYED IN ITALY AND CANADA 
BEFORE COMING HOME. 
</P>

<P>
It took Gill Fenerty less than 10 seconds to run the New Orleans Saints back 
into Sunday's game against the Rams -- the time he took to sprint 60 yards 
along the sideline for a fourth-quarter touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
And in a span of five minutes 48 seconds, he carried six carries to spearhead 
the drive that lifted New Orleans to a 24-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
But it took four years -- and a lot of frequent flier mileage -- to get the 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Fenerty grew up in New Orleans, played football at St. Jesuit High School in 
New Orleans and fantasized about someday playing for New Orleans. But when the 
Saints drafted him in 1986, Fenerty went marching out. 
</P>
<P>
Fenerty, a 6-foot, 205-pound running back who set virtually every rushing 
record at Holy Cross, was the Saints' seventh-round choice in '86. 
Unfortunately for him, they had drafted Dalton Hilliard in the second round and 
Rueben Mayes in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Fenerty, who shrugs and says, "There's only one football," figured the Saints 
weren't stockpiling brand-name running backs with the intention of playing a 
no-name from Holy Cross, so he declined to sign. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he also felt he really wasn't quite ready for the NFL. So he opted for 
the long road to the big league, via Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
After playing with an Italian pro team in the spring of 1986, he migrated to 
the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League where he rushed for 3,094 
in three seasons and set a club single-season record with 1,247 yards rushing 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints added Craig (Ironhead) Heyward to their throng of marquee backs in 
1988, but they hadn't given up the rights to Fenerty, and they were paying 
attention to his exploits north of the border. This time, they made Fenerty an 
offer he chose not to refuse. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"Money," he said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
If they weren't sure before Sunday, you can bet President/General Manager Jim 
Finks and Coach Jim Mora now are convinced he's worth every penny. Fenerty came 
into the game with 120 yards in 26 carries this season, but Sunday, he carried 
10 times and gained 104 yards. He also caught four passes for 35 yards and, 
maybe most important, rammed the ball down the Rams' throat on the Saints' 
game-winning drive. He ran the ball six times on the 10-play drive, picking up 
25 of the 42 yards en route to his first 100-yard game in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
When he came to terms with the Saints, Fenerty figured he would simply take the 
money and not run. Injuries to Hilliard and Mayes opened up a spot for a little 
action, however. He had been used mostly as a receiver out of the backfield on 
third-down situations, but against the Rams, Fenerty looked like Jim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"Rueben's been hurt and I decided that if Rueben was at all tentative early, 
we'd go to Gill," Mora said. "It turned out to be a good decision. He's been 
running the ball aggressively when he gets the chance, and I've been gaining 
confidence in him every week." 
</P>
<P>
As for Fenerty, who four years ago wasn't sure he could succeed in this league, 
Sunday was the confidence-booster he needed. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels great, but it feels even better that we won," he said. "Maybe when 
the season is over I'll look back and enjoy it, but we're still in the 
(playoff) hunt, and this win couldn't have come at a better time, so that feels 
even better." 
</P>
<P>
Early in the fourth quarter on a third-and-one play from the Saints' 40-yard 
line, Fenerty bounced off the pile at the line of scrimmage, raced around left 
end and somehow evaded Vince Newsome, who appeared to have the angle to make 
the tackle. Fifty yards later, Fenerty cut back past Darryl Henley, who was 
screened by Saint receiver Floyd Turner, and the Saints trailed, 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprised me as much as everyone else," Fenerty said. "It was just a 
short-yardage play designed to get the first down. I just outran the cornerback 
and it was clear sailing after that." 
</P>
<P>
So maybe he should have given the NFL a shot, oh, say four years ago? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I was ready to play in the NFL yet, mainly because I was coming 
off a severe head injury, a severe concussion, my last year in college," he 
said. "This game is all mental and I didn't have the confidence, so I just 
eased into it. It worked out and now I'm glad to have a chance to play for my 
hometown team." 
</P>
<P>
The local-boy-goes-traveling-and-returns-home-a-hero stuff sounds good, but 
this tale doesn't figure to have a storybook ending. When Hilliard, who has 
missed seven weeks with a knee injury, and Mayes return to form, Fenerty likely 
will end up standing on the sidelines rather than streaking along them. 
</P>
<P>
Hilliard, one of the toughest backs in the league to tackle, racked up 1,262 
yards rushing last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have five good backs when Dalton comes back, but that's not for me to 
worry about," Fenerty said. "I'll just do what they're telling me. It seems 
like this year, at one time or another, everyone's been hot, and I think 
they're confident now we all can do it. 
</P>
<P>
"So now it's just, 'Put the hot guy in.' " 
</P>
<P>
And, for one Sunday at least, this guy was hotter than a Bourbon Street 
crawfish.

RAMS SHOULD PUT THEIR TROUBLES IN THE HANDS OF GARY

<P>
This great waste of a Ram season continues to drag on at an excruciating pace 
-- three fiascoes to go, still? -- and it's a shame no one can take this ball 
of confusion and hand it off to Cleveland Gary. 
</P>
<P>
That'd be one way to get rid of it. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the times not to fumble. Here were the Rams, their season in ruins three 
weeks earlier, granted a glimmer of hope by the news on Sunday's scoreboard: 
Minnesota and Green Bay had lost, meaning a Ram victory over New Orleans would 
forge a four-way tie for the NFC's last wild-card slot at 6-7. Here were the 
Rams, leading New Orleans by 10 points in the fourth quarter of a game in which 
they would out-gain the Saints, 444 yards to 218, and out-first down them, 
24-9. 
</P>
<P>
There went the Rams, tripping over old bad habits and inventing new ones, going 
down in a 24-20 heap that, in its own way, was tougher to stomach than the 
disasters in Chicago and Pittsburgh and the overtime breakdown against 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
In this one: 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are headed for a 7-0 first-quarter lead, Gary over right tackle . . . 
and he fumbles the ball into the end zone, where New Orleans' Gene Atkins 
recovers for a touchback. 
</P>
<P>
The Ram defense amazes by keeping the Saints out of the end zone for the first 
half . . . and Jim Everett throws away a 10-3 lead when his third pass of the 
third quarter is picked off by Brett Maxie and returned 50 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Ram defense holds New Orleans to four first downs through the first three 
quarters, limits Saint running backs to 25 yards through the first three 
quarters . . . and opens the fourth quarter by falling down in front of Gill 
Fenerty, who is able to step over enough bodies for a 60-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams gamble by throwing a fourth-quarter pass to Gary . . . and he fumbles 
again, leaving New Orleans a scant 42 yards from the go-ahead touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Everett has to use two timeouts in the third quarter because his teammates 
forget how and where to line up . . . and then runs out of time in a chaotic 
final scramble, getting sacked as time expires, only to be saved, temporarily, 
by a Saint offsides penalty. 
</P>
<P>
There was no time left: 0:00. In a moment, the same would shine on the Rams' 
playoff pipe dream. 
</P>
<P>
But in between, Everett had one last fling. The game couldn't end on a 
defensive penalty, so it ended with a sigh. On fourth-and-goal from the nine, 
Everett looked briefly into the end zone, saw no one open, looked then to 
Buford McGee in the right flat, tried to throw . . . and then had New Orleans 
linebacker Pat Swilling, silent all Sunday, hit him as his arm cocked back. 
</P>
<P>
The pass skipped on the grass -- too short for McGee, but just right for the 
Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Rams, only in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
From domination to disaster -- and they needed only 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
This was a pure giveaway, so naturally, most of the postgame attention was 
directed to the man who gave it away twice, Gary, the Cleveland who keeps 
playing like a Brown. Five lost fumbles in four weeks. Eleven fumbles -- and 
seven lost -- in 13 weeks. Even John Robinson, Gary's head coach and head 
defender, couldn't roust up another rescue attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not the reason we lost the football game, but I don't know what I can say 
to protect him," Robinson said. "He just can't fumble any more." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, it was suggested that Gary had developed a mental block 
about holding onto the football. At the time, Robinson scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Robinson wasn't scoffing any more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to say it isn't now," Robinson said. "It's happening too 
frequently now. I can't do anything but accept that we've got a problem and 
we'd like it to go away." 
</P>
<P>
This is first for Robinson, a first for Gary. Robinson never coached a runaway 
fumbler before -- Wendell Tyler preceded him in Anaheim -- and he drafted Gary 
out of college in part because Gary never fumbled in college. 
</P>
<P>
But. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't carry the ball that much in college," Robinson said. "He's carried 
it, what, 200 times this year? (Actually 179.) And he's fumbled it five times, 
six times, eight times -- whatever it is. We'd like to say, '90% of the time, 
he holds onto it,' but we've got to accept it for what it is, and that he can't 
be in there until he makes some adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
Gary stood firm and handled the hard questions, better than he had handled the 
hard hits on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I let everybody down," Gary said. "This is the team that drafted 
me. They drafted me to run the football. I have an obligation to this team. I 
don't feel good about this. 
</P>
<P>
"Who cares if you lead the league in scoring? All you're going to hear about is 
the negative. I'm the league leader in scoring but, unfortunately, I'm also 
leading the league in fumbles. I don't know what the record is. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In college, I was a big, physical guy who also had a lot of quickness. After 
awhile, you start to get confidence -- 'They can't get a good shot at me.' 
</P>
<P>
"But here, everyone's quick. You get enough missiles shot at you, some are 
going to hit." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Everett did what he could to divert attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Cleveland runs the ball as hard as anybody. You'd like to think these 
things just happen at inopportune times, and you hope they're correctable," 
Everett said. "And it's more than just Cleveland. You can point fingers at all 
kinds of things, but we had a lot of things go wrong today." 
</P>
<P>
Those wasted timeouts, for two. 
</P>
<P>
"You're asking a lot of people to be responsible about where they should line 
up, and there were times when they weren't in the right formation," Everett 
complained. "I'm always going to call time because I'm always going to line us 
up correctly. 
</P>
<P>
"I did the exact same thing (call timeouts) in the 49er game, except we won. 
You win and those things go unnoticed." 
</P>
<P>
You lose and nothing goes unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
Did you notice the Rams have nothing more to do in this season than to wait for 
the next one?

Ricky Pierce scored 14 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter Sunday night as 
the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Seattle SuperSonics, 105-99, and tied a team 
record with a 10-0 start at home. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee, also 10-0 at home in 1984-85, trailed, 72-71, after three quarters 
before Pierce led a 13-2 run to start the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce took a pass from Alvin Robertson for a layup, Robertson stole the ball 
and dunked to start a three-point play and Pierce hit a jump shot, putting the 
Bucks ahead, 78-72. 
</P>
<P>
After a Sonic basket, the Bucks scored the next six points, four by Pierce, and 
led, 84-74, with 9:11 to go. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle closed to 103-99 with 12 seconds left on a dunk by Shawn Kemp, who led 
the Sonics with a career-high 31 points. But Pierce made two free throws two 
seconds later to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson added 19 points and Dan Schayes a season-high 17 for the Bucks, who 
tied Detroit for the Central Division lead at 14-6. Derrick McKey added 19 
points for the Sonics.

SALES OF MAIL-ORDER EDIBLES ARE MUSHROOMING; 
</P>
<P>
FOOD: MANY CALIFORNIA FIRMS ARE GETTING A SLICE OF THE $1.2-BILLION MARKET, 
WHICH IS BUSIEST DURING THE HOLIDAYS. OVERNIGHT DELIVERY SERVICE HAS HELPED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
'Tis the season for mail-order giving, and more of the gifts crisscrossing the 
nation make for a transportable feast. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit in the mail is nothing new, but how about six pints of assorted gelato 
packed in dry ice? It's yours, if someone doesn't mind paying $10 a pint to get 
it to you. 
</P>
<P>
And forget the mundane fruitcake. Select instead a bouquet of porcini 
mushrooms, a pair of smoked quail or a basket of prickly pears. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,600 companies that tempt the palate with mail-order edibles are competing 
for the $1.2 billion that Americans are expected to spend on food orders this 
year, according to a recent study by the New York market research firm 
FIND-SVP. 
</P>
<P>
Growing at an annual rate of about 10%, sales of mail-order foods are likely to 
total more than $3 billion by 2000, FIND-SVP said. 
</P>
<P>
Business whips into a frenzy during the final quarter, with some mail-order 
companies doing virtually all their shipping between September and January. 
Entire 747 jets have been stuffed with nothing but thousands of pounds of 
holiday pears from Harry and David. 
</P>
<P>
Based in Medford, Ore., Harry and David has sales of more than $120 million, 
making it perhaps the largest mail-order food company in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
FIND-SVP says the top 10 food-by-mail companies control 45% of the market. 
About 3,000 companies are characterized as mom-and-pop operations, with sales 
less than $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the vast majority of food moves by ground transportation, most of the 
industry's growth is in overnight and two-day delivery services, which can 
guarantee that a delicate or perishable item arrives intact. 
</P>
<P>
Clambake Celebrations of Cape Cod, Mass., for example, can promise a customer 
in Albuquerque, N.M., that she will have lobster, mussels and a few ears of 
corn -- all packed in seaweed -- steaming on the stove less than 48 hours after 
phoning in the order. The cost: $119.95 for two. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's Gelato Classico Italian Ice Cream is just begining to offer its 
products by mail. Six pints -- a minimum order at $59.95 -- are packaged in dry 
ice in a foam container much like a picnic cooler. 
</P>
<P>
Consultant Jay Walker, who heads Ridgefield, Conn.-based Catalog Media Corp., 
said that though food-by-mail has been big business for a long time, "overnight 
delivery . . . allowed a freshness perception for millions of people who didn't 
believe they could get (food) fresh in the mail. And it made sure food can be 
given as a gift reliably." 
</P>
<P>
Federal Express will tell you that it has been a major boost to the food 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business . . . allows them to extend their business season right up to 
Dec. 21," said spokesman David Brandon. "If you do 80% of your business in one 
or two months of the year and can extend that selling season by just two weeks, 
it's a tremendous boost." 
</P>
<P>
Companies with very narrow product lines can stay in business because they 
cater to a national -- rather than local -- clientele. Franklin Foods of North 
Franklin, Conn., for example, sells only exotic mushrooms such as Polish cepes, 
shiitakes and porcinis. Smithfield, Va.-based Fin 'N Feather will put a smoked 
pheasant buffet on your table. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Spear Inc. of Stockton has cultivated a list of 25,000 fans of its colossal 
asparagus, its sole product. "It's an alternative to flowers," said President 
Chip Arnett. 
</P>
<P>
His super-premium asparagus, which has been served at the White House, simply 
is "not in sufficient enough quantities to make it available from a retail 
standpoint," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Consultant Walker believes that the food-by-mail business is "countercyclical" 
to the economy -- that is, as the recession deepens, business is likely to 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers who feel pinched for cash typically "trade down" when it comes to 
buying gifts, and food is a popular alternative because it has "no comparative 
market price," Walker said. "You don't know if a dozen apples from an orchard 
in Oregon is a $20 gift or a $40 gift," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perusing catalogues in the coziness of one's own home and ordering with the 
mere push of telephone buttons has become a recreational pastime of sorts for 
many Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"People are sitting home, and they're bored, and so they pick up the phone and 
buy on a credit card," said Debbie Cohen, a national saleswoman for Melissa's 
World Variety Produce Inc., a Los Angeles company that specializes in shipping 
exotic produce such as purple potatoes, elephant garlic and prickly pears. 
</P>
<P>
Though consumers who buy foods through the mail make up less than 2% of the 
population, they are an affluent lot willing to pay more for convenience and a 
guarantee of quality. 
</P>
<P>
A pint of Gelato Classico costs just $3.95 in one of the company's 32 shops, 
but the minimum six-pint mail order commands a $36 shipping charge. Too 
extravagant to buy for yourself, perhaps, but an exquisite gift to give. 
</P>
<P>
The mail-order business does have its limitations. 
</P>
<P>
Identifying customers can be costly, and it is difficult to adapt quickly to 
changes in consumer taste. A company that must put together its Christmas 
catalogue by August can't suddenly decide to replace its pecan pie if 
cranberries become the rage. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the threat of higher postal rates always looms large. Third-class 
postage, the rate for most catalogues, has increased more than 350% since 1970, 
and the U.S. Postal Service plans another rate hike for February. 
</P>
<P>
Mail-order companies are being pressed to collect sales taxes on a higher 
proportion of their sales, forcing them to compete harder against local 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, because the food business is seasonal, some companies actually are 
forced to shut down during spring and summer. Others try to round out their 
offerings with other products. Harry and David, for example, has a sister 
company called Jackson and Perkins, a gardening and flower concern, which helps 
smooth out sales through the year.

<P>
It's Thanksgiving Day and 12-year-old Jason Pierce is sitting on the living 
room couch in his family's comfortable Cerritos tract home. In the kitchen, his 
stepmother, Irene, is surrounded by family members as she and her mother lift a 
steaming, 20-pound turkey out of its pan. 
</P>
<P>
Jason's father, Jim, straddles the open patio door as he puffs on a cigarette, 
trying to blow the smoke away from his guests. Jason's 15-year-old stepbrother, 
John-Michael Montes, is counting the fish he keeps in an aquarium by the 
kitchen; several little cousins play nearby. 
</P>
<P>
It's a lovely, thoroughly conventional Thanksgiving scene. 
</P>
<P>
But in the living room, Jason is neither counting his blessings nor 
anticipating pumpkin pie. He is telling a stranger about the lawyer he hopes 
will represent him in a custody fight. 
</P>
<P>
Jason wants to live with his mother in Tennessee. Jim Pierce, who has custody 
of his son, wants him to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm old enough to pick," says Jason. "I'm calling my lawyer tomorrow to see 
when I can get a court date. I'll tell the judge I want to live with my mom." 
</P>
<P>
Jason, whose parents divorced when he was a toddler, always feels his loyalties 
are divided. But around the holidays, he says, his ambivalence intensifies. 
"It's hard," he says, "because if I'm with my mom, I want to be with my dad, 
but I'm glad I'm with my mom. But if I'm with my dad, I want to be with my mom, 
but I'm glad I'm with my dad. 
</P>
<P>
"Both your parents want you. Then if you go to one, the other one feels bad; 
then if you move to the other, the other one feels bad." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, when the bad feelings start to overwhelm him, Jason does the only 
constructive thing he can think of: He goes to the park and runs. 
</P>
<P>
With Thanksgiving a memory and Christmas closing in, plenty of children are 
feeling like Jason. Between 15 and 16 million of the country's 63.6 million 
children live with a single divorced parent or in a step family, according to 
statistics kept by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Stepfamily Foundation.

Children aren't the only ones who will experience the pangs of dividing their 
time and their hearts during the holidays. Moms will be fending off the 
heaviness that descends when their children leave to spend Christmas Eve at 
Daddy's house. Dads will spend lots of time behind the wheel, carting children 
from home to Mom's to Grandma's. 
</P>
<P>
And so, step families celebrating their first holidays together try to figure 
out how to combine their cultures and traditions. And almost everyone will be 
feeling a little blue because they can't be. 
</P>
<P>
These emotions and efforts testify to the magnetic strength of the family. 
Divorce or death may pull this most primal social unit apart, but nothing can 
prevent it from re-creating itself. 
</P>
<P>
The holidays can be a minefield of emotions and logistics for just about 
everyone, but they are even more treacherous for split families, which must 
navigate -- with precision, maturity and humor -- the stormy passage that links 
November to January. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the Pierces are settling down to their feast in Cerritos, the Robertson 
clan in Culver City is finishing up the dishes from its holiday repast. This is 
the second shared Thanksgiving for Tim Robertson, who has custody of daughters 
Brianna, 11, and McKenna, 5, and his girlfriend, Joni Pierson, who lives with 
Kim, 10, and Stephanie, 6. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, 41, an architect, and Pierson, 34, a day-care center operator, are 
sitting in his parents' back yard with their kids, while Robertson's mother, 
sisters and nieces get dessert ready. 
</P>
<P>
Pierson says her holidays sometimes feel like driving marathons. 
</P>
<P>
"I want (my daughters) to have time with both parents, and I'm responsible for 
them being seen by their grandparents on both sides," she says. "It is a lot of 
driving around." 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie, Pierson's younger child, nods in agreement. "It's kinda weird to be 
back and forth from my mom's house to my dad's house. It just feels weird, 
going to different places all the time. Sometimes, it makes me feel sad." 
</P>
<P>
On this day, the Pierson girls woke up at their mother's house and were driven 
by Pierson to Pasadena to visit their father's parents. Just as Pierson 
returned from dropping the girls off in Pasadena, her ex-husband called 
unexpectedly to say he wanted to visit with the girls and would bring them 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't tell us he was going to be there," says Kim. "Sometimes I feel sad, 
but I don't know. Today it felt sort of happy." 
</P>
<P>
Christmas promises to be just as mobile for both families. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson's daughter, Brianna, explains: "We spend the night with my dad, we 
get up and open our presents, then we get dressed and we come over here (to 
Robertson's parents' house). Then my mom picks us up here and takes us to her 
house so we can get presents. Then she takes us to our other grandma's so we 
can celebrate with them in Granada Hills." 
</P>
<P>
Pierson's eldest, Kim, chimes in: "For us, it's pretty much we spend the night 
at our mom's house (in West Los Angeles), then we open our presents, then our 
dad comes by and picks us up to take us to his house (in Canoga Park), then he 
takes us to our grandma's house (in South Pasadena), then we come back to my 
house or we go to my aunt's house to celebrate Christmas with the rest of the 
family." 
</P>
<P>
The hardest part of splitting holidays, says Robertson, is that his daughters 
often don't want to leave their cousins when it comes time to be picked up by 
their mom. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'We wanna stay,' but I tell them that this is their time to be with 
their mother." 
</P>
<P>
That is precisely the way to handle such a conflict, says Neil Kalter, a 
therapist and director of the Center for the Child and the Family at the 
University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"It is always a good idea, if possible, for adults to act like adults," Kalter 
says. "If you're a single parent, your (children) may be reluctant to leave 
because they may be concerned about how you will do alone. Parents should sit 
down and say, 'Hey, this is the arrangement. You will be with me, then you'll 
go to Dad's.' 
</P>
<P>
He suggests using the third person to reassure your children. Instead of 
saying, "Don't worry about leaving me alone," say "A lot of kids think their 
moms might be lonely when they go see their dads, but even if the moms haven't 
married again, they enjoy having time to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Three days before Thanksgiving, Lisa Hinte is sitting in the living room of her 
step-grandparents' home near Carthay Circle in West Los Angeles. A study in hip 
with her ruby lips, slicked-back hair and black leggings, Lisa, 21, reflects on 
what the holidays have come to mean for her, the grown child of divorced 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I kinda go numb around the holidays," she says. "I kinda shut off." 
</P>
<P>
"My fantasy about the holiday is having my own family, having a big family. I 
really long for a loving, warm family . . . to go to a big house and have, you 
know, the fireplace and everybody being warm together and nice together. . . . 
I know that I'll never have that." 
</P>
<P>
Her parents, Gary and Diane Hinte, divorced when she was 5; they believe they 
have maintained a cooperative relationship over the years. Lisa lived with her 
mother until she was 13. Then she moved in with her father, who owns an art 
printing business, and his wife, Carol Samuels, a therapist who heads a local 
chapter of the Stepfamily Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
There have been times when Gary, 57, and Carol, 52, have tried to re-create the 
holiday family dinner for Lisa and her older brother, Jeff, a graduate student 
at the University of Michigan. Last Christmas, they invited Diane to join them. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice, but it was a little uncomfortable," says Diane, 49, a sales 
manager for a fiber optics company. "It's not something I would want to do all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
"She left right after dinner," says Carol. "That good feeling only goes a 
certain way. There are these little emotional ripples. You know (how) when you 
watch the ocean and a wind goes across the surface? It's like that." 
</P>
<P>
Gary, though, says he didn't notice any discomfort. "I enjoy so much having 
everybody together that I kind of shine on the differences," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"The holidays, from Thanksgiving on, are all family-centered and 
family-focused," says Tom Seibt, a therapist and step-family specialist who 
teaches at the California Family Study Center in North Hollywood. That's why a 
lot of children of divorced parents get the "what's-wrong-with-us?" blues or 
indulge in fantasies like Lisa's. 
</P>
<P>
"For the kids, the feeling of family comes from their sense of who the members 
of the family are," says Seibt. "I'm sure you've heard the statement that 
'divorce doesn't end the family, it only restructures it.' And that's important 
because kids have their own internal picture of who is in and who is not in the 
family, and they are very protective of that image or fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
The happy family fantasy dished up by the media is tremendously disheartening 
to the millions of families that cannot hope to attain it. What they need to 
remember, says Constance Ahrons, a USC professor and co-author of "Living with 
Divorce," is that intact families aren't exactly perfect units either. 
</P>
<P>
"Divorced and remarried families are the predominant trend, and we treat them 
as though they're unusual or deviant," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nostalgia for a family of the past, and we forget that that family was 
not always that happy. What about alcoholism? Incest?" 
</P>
<P>
A common refrain among divorced parents is that a holiday without children 
doesn't really feel like a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"The tradition of being together was shattered," Gary Hinte says, "so trying to 
make holidays on our own was kind of an empty task." 
</P>
<P>
Joni Pierson was miserable two years ago when her girls spent Christmas Eve 
with their father. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to me that they wake up with me on Christmas morning," she 
says. "The year before last, they woke up at his house on Christmas Day. It was 
difficult for me." 
</P>
<P>
Jim and Irene Pierce, both 44, say that when Jason is with his mother and 
John-Michael is at his father's on Christmas Day, their house feels painfully 
empty. "You look around and go, 'Today's Christmas? Uh-uh. Where are the kids? 
Where is the family?' " 
</P>
<P>
Self-pity is an easy trap for a lonely parent, says Seibt. It is especially 
damaging when the children are made to feel guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, unconsciously, they say things that make the kid feel guilty: 
'I want you to have fun with your dad and I'm going to be all alone,' " he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he says, parents should make plans for themselves, then reassure their 
children that, 'I love you and I am taking care of myself, and this is Dad's 
Christmas with you and next year you will spend Christmas with me.' " 
</P>
<P>
If parents don't want children to leave, he says, they are "just gonna have to 
learn to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
The way ex-spouses treat each other always affects how children handle a 
divorce, but during the holidays children are especially sensitive to 
hostility, which can reverberate like sonic booms. 
</P>
<P>
Seibt says that around the holidays he sees things "going kind of crazy" with 
the step families he counsels, "because if you've got a situation where the 
parents can't work out the issues, or the parents still continue to be in 
conflict and fighting, the kid will be caught in the middle and will feel that 
he has to please one or the other parent and will feel guilty if he chooses to 
see one or the other of them." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the couples who fight the hardest after divorce are still profoundly 
bonded, he says. 
</P>
<P>
In "Divorced Families," Ahrons categorizes the types of post-divorce parenting 
relationships. They range from "perfect pals" to "fiery foes." 
</P>
<P>
"The major finding of my study is that we have a stereotype of what ex-spouses 
look like in their relationships: angry people who can't talk to each other," 
says Ahrons. "Yet, we find a good percentage of people who are quite 
cooperative after divorce . . . because of the children." 
</P>
<P>
The Pierces, active in their local Stepfamily Assn., experience both extremes. 
Jim's relationship with his ex-wife, Peggy Larson, is tense and angry, while 
Irene's relationship with her ex-husband, Juan Montes, and his wife, Shirley, 
is cordial. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, the lawyer Jason Pierce planned to contact was on vacation the 
day after Thanksgiving. But Jason is confident a judge will rule in his favor 
because he plans to accuse his father of lying during a previous custody 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that my dad lied about me in court to get custody," says Jason. He adds 
that he loves both his parents but prefers the friendlier, rural atmosphere of 
Tennessee. And he fears that his mother, who recently divorced again, is 
lonely. 
</P>
<P>
Jason's father says he is "one, hurt; two, angry, and three, frustrated" by the 
situation, although he says he is not angry at his son. He believes Jason 
misunderstood the custody proceeding because he was not in the courtroom. And 
he says he doubts that Jason fully understands the legal process involved. 
</P>
<P>
"He's caught in loyalty conflicts," says Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Jason will be spending Christmas in California this year 
because he is optimistic that next year he will be living with his mother, who 
is encouraging his legal fight. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a lot of children of divorced parents, Jason doesn't yearn for his 
parents to be together for the holidays. For one thing, he was so young when 
they split up that he doesn't remember them ever spending the holidays 
together. For another, he knows they can't be in the same room. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd end up killing each other," he says. "Someone would start carving the 
turkey, and they'd end up carving the other person." 
</P>
<P>
He shakes his head and smiles a little at what he's just said, the way you 
might just before you cry.

IMPLANT FUROR: HEALTH WARNING OR HYSTERIA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Marie Walsh has watched her health deteriorate. She has been plagued 
by fatigue, abdominal pains, irregular menstrual periods and night sweats. 
</P>
<P>
Then one morning in February, 1984, she awoke to find the front of her 
nightgown damp with a bloody gel that had oozed from her left breast. A surgeon 
later found that an implant had ruptured, spilling silicone gel inside the 
breast cavity. He cleaned out as much gel as he could and put in a new implant. 
</P>
<P>
But Walsh's problems worsened. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills woman needed multiple surgeries to replace later implants that 
hardened uncomfortably and to remove silicone-filled tumors. She developed a 
variety of debilitating diseases: rheumatoid arthritis that made it painful for 
her to walk; scleroderma that tightened her skin and made her hollow-eyed; 
chronic lymph, kidney and liver problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disintegrating," she says. "It's just a question of time (as to) what is 
going to go next." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, 44, and her doctor are convinced that silicone gel from the implants has 
migrated through her body and caused chaos in her immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Walsh won an $80,000 settlement against the manufacturer of 
the ruptured breast implant. That publicity has spun her into the center of an 
emerging nationwide network of women who allege that silicone implants, by far 
the most popular of breast-augmentation procedures, pose health hazards that 
are kept secret from consumers. 
</P>
<P>
She and other activists are crashing seminars on breast augmentation, courting 
newspaper and television reporters and filing lawsuits to draw attention to 
their claims. 
</P>
<P>
Breast-implant manufacturers and most plastic surgeons say such fears are 
irrational. They contend the devices' benefits -- primarily boosting a woman's 
self-esteem -- outweigh the risks, and they say there is no scientific evidence 
linking breast implants to cancer or diseases that attack the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Garry Brody, a clinical professor of plastic surgery at the University of 
Southern California and chairman of the American Society of Plastic and 
Reconstructive Surgeons device council, complains that the Command Trust 
Network, a national women's educational group, discourages women who would 
benefit from breast implants by "spreading panic." 
</P>
<P>
Brody says USC is studying more than 3,000 women in Los Angeles County who have 
had silicone breast implants. So far he has found that they have no higher 
incidence of cancer than the general population. 
</P>
<P>
Still, breast implants have become increasingly controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Safety concerns have prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and its 
Canadian counterpart to call for further investigations and to collect test 
data from manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of breast implants have in their corner a Ralph Nader-founded advocate 
organization, Public Citizen Health Research Group, which has demanded that 
implants be taken off the market and has sued the FDA for access to 
manufacturers' records. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are high. An estimated 2 million American women have had 
breast-implant surgery, which is performed about 130,000 times a year. About 
85% of breast implant procedures are done for cosmetic reasons alone; the rest 
are performed for reconstructions after mastectomy. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William Shaw, chief of the division of plastic surgery at UCLA Medical 
Center, says of the controversy: "It could be a bigger problem waiting to be 
confirmed or a smaller problem with a great deal of hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the controversy are devices that look like sacks, with a 
rubbery silicone skin and silicone gel filling. 
</P>
<P>
They were designed by two plastic surgeons from Houston who were looking for an 
alternative to plastic sponge implants. Used since the 1930s, sponge implants 
often made breasts very hard and frequently caused allergic reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors also injected silicone liquid directly into women's breasts. In some 
cases, this caused severe health problems, and the FDA banned the procedure in 
the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
First used in 1963, silicone gel implants have become especially popular in 
recent years as fashion and films have played up the larger-breasted look. 
Advertisements in women's magazines and newspapers have enticed women with the 
purported ease of the implant procedure, which costs from $2,000 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Silicone gel implants give a natural feeling to the breast; the sack is 
designed to prevent the gel from getting into tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after its introduction, however, patients began complaining about buildup 
of scar tissue around the implant, making the breast hard and causing pain. 
This condition occurs in 30% to 50% of breast-implant patients, many of whom 
have repeated surgeries to try to correct it. 
</P>
<P>
And it is generally conceded that the implants can hamper efforts to detect 
breast cancer through mammography. 
</P>
<P>
Of far greater dispute is whether silicone gel, some of which leaks out of all 
implants, can damage a woman's health. While the medical community once 
considered silicone "inert" within the body, more recent research indicates 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
There is also concern about the polyurethane foam that surrounds one type of 
silicone implant. 
</P>
<P>
The foam, which is intended to reduce scarring, may break down in the body, and 
some studies have shown that under certain laboratory conditions, the 
disintegrating foam emits a chemical, diamino toluene (TDA), known to cause 
cancer in animals. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is investigating these issues and demanding more information from 
manufacturers. Before a 1976 FDA amendment, devices such as silicone implants 
did not require federal approval or testing. 
</P>
<P>
The agency in 1988 determined that silicone gel implants pose "a potential 
unreasonable risk of injury"; it is still drafting the testing requirements for 
manufacturers. For now, the implants can be sold without passing any safety 
tests specified by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA acknowledges that even if preliminary tests show the implants are safe, 
it may be 10 or 15 years before there is enough data to determine whether 
implants increase the risk of cancer or immune-system diseases. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 27, a District of Columbia federal district court ordered the FDA to 
release documents to Public Citizen Health Research Group from studies 
performed by Dow Corning Corp. during the last 25 years on the safety of 
silicone gel used in its implants. Dow is a major manufacturer of silicone 
gel-filled implants. 
</P>
<P>
Release of the information, however, has been stopped pending Dow's appeal. The 
company argues that the test data it gave to the FDA should be kept 
confidential, away from competitors; the FDA has not decided whether to join 
Dow Corning in the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Rylee, a Dow vice president, claims that competitors could use the test 
information to obtain FDA approval without performing their own expensive and 
time-consuming tests. Dow maintains it is sufficient for the FDA, "as the 
guardian of public health," to have the information. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Sidney Wolfe, the Public Citizen director, says he believes the public 
deserves "a glimpse at what the companies knew 10 or 20 years ago about the 
toxicity of silicone and silicone gel." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her lingering illnesses, Marie Walsh still has implants in her breasts. 
</P>
<P>
"Every doctor has told me it won't make a difference" in her health to remove 
them at this point, says the mother of eight. But recently, after consulting a 
new physician, Walsh decided she will have them taken out. 
</P>
<P>
"Her problem is induced by the silicone, and if she takes it out, there is at 
least a 50% chance that she will improve," says Dr. Gharoon Panahi, a 
Westminster rheumatologist. Panahi says he has six other patients with 
immune-system disorders who have breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd give anything to have my life back," says Walsh, who opted for an implant 
to correct a left breast that never fully developed. "I would rather be 
flat-chested and have my health and vitality." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who has been forced by ill health to quit a career in securities sales 
and go on permanent disability, now devotes much energy to organizing an Orange 
County support group for women with similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
She is assisted by Marsha Chambers, a Tustin woman who contacted Walsh after 
reading about her legal settlement. Chambers suffers from hepatitis and other 
ailments that she blames on her implants, which were removed in June. 
</P>
<P>
Together the women placed a tiny ad in a Tustin newspaper. It attracted 40 
other women who meet regularly to discuss their health problems and how to warn 
others about silicone implants. 
</P>
<P>
They have scoured medical libraries for information about implant hazards, and 
they show up at public seminars on breast augmentation to distribute flyers. 
</P>
<P>
Their group is linked to the Command Trust Network. The network was founded 
last year by Kathleen Anneken of Covington, Ky., and Sybil Goldrich of Beverly 
Hills, both of whom had a history of implant-related problems and a desire to 
reach out to others. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided an organization had to be established to provide the kind of 
information not routinely given in physicians' offices, but information that we 
believed was essential for a woman to make a completely informed decision about 
what she was putting in her body," Goldrich says. 
</P>
<P>
She complains that so far only Maryland has enacted state legislation requiring 
physicians to inform women, through a standardized brochure, of implant risks. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Arcarese, director of the FDA's office of training and assistance for 
medical devices, says that an FDA advisory panel held hearings in 1988 and 
determined that "patients are poorly informed." 
</P>
<P>
In response to the panel's request, he says, the FDA has created committees 
representing consumers, physicians and the medical industry to write 
informational pamphlets for women considering breast enlargement or 
reconstruction after mastectomy. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, Arcarese says, members of the committees, which include 
representatives of Command Trust Network, can't agree on the content of the 
pamphlets, now in their fifth draft. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a growing number of women with implant problems are suing 
manufacturers. The Public Citizen Health Research Group is acting as an 
informational clearinghouse for plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
The group estimates that at least 200 product-liability lawsuits are pending 
against manufacturers of silicone implants. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, a federal court jury ordered Dow Corning Corp. of Midland, Mich., to 
pay $1.5 million in punitive damages and $211,000 in actual damages to Maria 
Stern, a Nevada mastectomy patient whose implants leaked silicone into her 
body. Before the case was heard on appeal, Stern and Dow settled. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Bolton, a Redwood City attorney who worked on the Stern case, says he has 
since taken on 10 to 15 cases of women with implant problems. In five of those 
cases, he says, the plaintiffs have received out-of-court payments to drop the 
litigation. So far, no cases have gone to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Bolton says that as part of such settlements, manufacturers routinely insist 
that the payment amount and the plaintiff's documents be sealed from the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of implant safety say that lawsuits are triggered by greedy lawyers 
and a small group of hysterical women who are ill and looking for someone to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons recently reported 
the results of a survey of 592 women with implants. It showed that 92.5% were 
satisfied, and that 82% would, without a doubt, repeat surgery. 
</P>
<P>
And although a Dow Corning study linked silicone to cancerous growths in rats, 
the company and the FDA agree that the test produced a form of cancer to which 
humans would not be susceptible. 
</P>
<P>
"There is too much emotionalism that gets into this thing," says Dow Corning's 
Rylee. "What we really need is more understanding and true science." 
</P>
<P>
Rylee says Dow Corning is trying to develop a national epidemiology study to 
determine whether there is a link between silicone implants and immune-system 
disorders. A major difficulty, he says, is that the diseases in question -- 
lupus, scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis -- have always been most prevalent 
in women ages 20 to 55, the most prominent implant group. 
</P>
<P>
"None of our scientific consultants or internal scientists or physicians have 
yet been able to show there is a causal relationship," Rylee says. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial implants are those covered with polyurethane foam. They 
are marketed by Surgitek, a Paso Robles subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 
the New York-based pharmaceutical and consumer-products giant. 
</P>
<P>
Garry L. Carter, vice president and general manager of Surgitek's plastic 
surgery division, says the polyurethane-coated implant "is probably the 
fastest-growing product in the industry," representing about 20% of all U.S. 
implant sales. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dr. Richard Caleel, president of the American Academy of Cosmetic 
Surgery, says: "There are a lot of cosmetic surgeons who do not use 
polyurethane-covered implants because they are not sure about what happens to 
the polyurethane." 
</P>
<P>
A study by Chris Batish, a biomaterials scientist and professor at the 
University of Florida, suggested that polyurethane used by Surgitek is not the 
best choice for medical applications because of its tendency to disintegrate in 
the body. Once that happens, Batish said in a recent interview, "no one is sure 
where it goes." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Batish said he found that, in the laboratory, he could break the 
foam into chemical components, including the animal carcinogen TDA. 
</P>
<P>
Surgitek counters that laboratory conditions employed by Batish were harsher 
than conditions inside the body. The company says other studies that more 
closely approximate human biology show the foam breaks down very slowly and 
passes through the body without causing harm. 
</P>
<P>
Surgitek also says its research shows that the amount of TDA produced when the 
foam disintegrates is medically insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government recently conducted its own laboratory tests on the foam 
and found no release of TDA, says Irwin Hinberg, acting chief of the research 
and standards division of the country's Health Protection Branch. 
</P>
<P>
But, although neither that agency nor the FDA believes there is cause to outlaw 
polyurethane-coated implants, both advocate more studies. 
</P>
<P>
But a few doctors and scientists say there is more than enough information 
about implant dangers to raise a red flag. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Douglas R. Shanklin, a pathologist at the University of Tennessee, calls 
the silicone implants a disaster waiting to happen. He says some women with 
implants "go five, 10, 15 years with no problem, and then all hell breaks 
loose." 
</P>
<P>
Shanklin says he has seen silicone in tissue taken from the thyroid glands and 
spleens of women with the implants. "I think they (implants) should be taken 
off the market pending resolution of these problems," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He adds that the various immune-system diseases reported by women can be 
serious: "These are fatal diseases in time. Lupus destroys the kidneys, and 
scleroderma can affect the heart and lungs." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rensch, an assistant professor of engineering mechanics at the 
University of Nebraska, says he has examined over 500 deflated breast implants. 
"From all the pain and suffering I have seen, I wouldn't recommend anyone to 
use these devices from anyone or any company," Rensch says. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, UCLA's Shaw says he has seen a dozen women with implants who 
also have arthritis and other immune-system diseases: 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it is difficult to tell who has severe symptoms from the implants 
and who would have had them anyway. The causes of the diseases are a mystery. 
You have to admit it looks awfully suspicious. . . . This is a subject I think 
should be looked at. We shouldn't brush these people off."

SONY-OWNED TRI-STAR UNVEILS PLANS FOR FILMS IN '91 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying there has been no interference in content from its Japanese owners, 
Tri-Star Pictures on Friday revealed its first production schedule under Sony 
Corp. ownership. The ambitious program will put 15 feature films before the 
cameras during 1991, involving such filmmakers as David Lean, Steven Spielberg, 
Milos Forman and Roland Joffe, and stars Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Robin 
Williams, Michael Douglas and Julia Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Medavoy, who became chairman of Tri-Star after years of heading production 
for Orion Pictures, dismissed concerns that foreign ownership of Hollywood 
studios might affect the content of their movies, saying, "We're on a direction 
that is no different than when we were under American ownership." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, there has been no interference in budgets, either. Medavoy would 
not discuss project costs of any of 15 films announced, but he said they are in 
line with the average major studio budget, which was about $24 million in 1990. 
That would mean a total production budget of more than $350 million for the 
first year of Sony-backed Tri-Star pictures. 
</P>
<P>
During 1991, Medavoy said Tri-Star will release 12 movies, two more than this 
year. Among those scheduled to be made and released next year are: "Nostromo," 
director Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt's adaptation of the Joseph Conrad 
novel about an Italian sailor who helps smuggle a shipload of silver and then 
keeps it for himself; "Bugsy Siegel," directed by Barry Levinson, and starring 
Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, about the gangster who "created" Las Vegas; 
and "Hook," an adaptation of the James M. Barrie "Peter Pan" books and play, 
starring Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, Robin Williams as Peter and Julia 
Roberts as Tinkerbell. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's press luncheon at Tri-Star's temporary Burbank headquarters (a new 
executive office building is being constructed at the Sony/Columbia lot where 
MGM once reigned in Culver City), was the first such meeting since Medavoy was 
named chairman nine months ago and Sony acquired Columbia Pictures 
Entertainment late last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we've put together a rather spectacular number of films in a short 
time," Medavoy said, giving credit to his production team and the company's 
relationship with Carolco Pictures, which produced the Tri-Star-distributed 
"Total Recall" last summer, and generated $120 million in ticket sales. As part 
of the studio's future direction, he also announced "first-look" production 
deals with actors Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro and others. 
</P>
<P>
Medavoy, responding to the intense interest in Japanese takeovers in Hollywood, 
said he "never has a sense that the Sony people are around." He said he 
regularly meets with Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the co-chairmen of Columbia 
Pictures Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them everything I'm doing," Medavoy said, adding that his contract 
guarantees him autonomy over the Tri-Star operation. He said Tri-Star and the 
Columbia Pictures division operate like sister companies and that he confers 
with Frank Price, his Columbia counterpart, to avoid competing for projects. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other Tri-Star projects announced Friday: 
</P>
<P>
"Thunderheart," a contemporary Native American thriller, produced by DeNiro; 
"City of Joy," to be shot in Calcutta, India, directed by Roland Joffe; a Dr. 
Suess-based film, "Oh, the Places You'll Go," that will combine live action and 
animation, produced by Joffe; an untitled pop musical produced by Warrington 
Hudlin and directed by Reginald Hudlin; an untitled Milos Forman film, which 
Medavoy described as "top secret." 
</P>
<P>
Also: a Richard Gere starrer for Rastar Prods., "Mr. Jones," about a 
manic-depressive man and his relationship with his psychiatrist; "Even Cowgirls 
Get the Blues," based on the Tom Robbins novel, with Gus Van Sant ("Drugstore 
Cowboy") directing and writing. 
</P>
<P>
From Carolco: Michael Douglas starring in the controversial and erotic "Basic 
Instinct," written by Joe Eszterhas and Gary Goldman, directed by Paul 
Verhoeven; "Isobar," a futuristic action-thriller to star Sylvester Stallone; 
"Bartholemew vs. Neff," about feuding neighbors, starring Stallone and John 
Candy; "Universal Soldier," a futuristic thriller with Jean-Claude Van Damme 
and Dolph Lundgren, about an officer out to stop his unit of genetically 
engineered soldiers who have gone awry.

WHERE IS ARTS SUPPORT COMING FROM?; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: CULTURAL LEADERS CONCLUDE THAT COLLABORATION IS THE KEY TO SURVIVAL AT 
A WORKSHOP ON 'SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS IN UNSUPPORTIVE TIMES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Arts funding is in big trouble and collaboration is the ticket to survival, 
according to cultural leaders who convened last week in Los Angeles. They put 
their heads together at "Support for the Arts in Unsupportive Times," a 
workshop sponsored by the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation at the Century 
Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have an agenda," said foundation director Henry Hopkins before the 
group launched into a wide-ranging discussion of financial matters that also 
considered such issues as censorship and multicultural representation. 
</P>
<P>
Neither did the foundation expect the 20 participants to arrive at conclusions 
or a plan for action. They didn't. A few of their number even took issue with 
the workshop theme. Artist David Ireland said he had been "generously taken 
care of by different foundations," and philanthropist Max Palevsky contended, 
"If there is any time in the history of the world that the arts have been 
supported, it's now . . . If you look at numbers, dollars and activities, these 
are far from unsupportive times." 
</P>
<P>
The prevailing view held that most arts organizations are dangerously 
overextended -- and some are endangered. As the talks evolved, several villains 
emerged -- sluggish museums, hidebound boards of trustees, the political right, 
the press and John Frohnmayer, head of the embattled National Endowment for the 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
But the group laid most problems at its own doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
"The structures we have developed to support the arts are houses of cards," 
said Ella King Torry, of the Pew Charitable Trusts, noting that dependence on 
earned income, box office or a few donors is "a shaky system" at best. "It's 
like the homeless," she said. "If two things go wrong, if you have a bad season 
and one of your funders falls out, you could go under." 
</P>
<P>
Boards of trustees' system of governance also came under attack. "Our field is 
not given to institutionalization and it should not be institutionalized for 
the most part," said Claire Peeps, program director of the Los Angeles 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as boards are made up of extremely rich Caucasian individuals those 
boards will be inherently conservative," said Gary Garrels, director of the New 
York-based DIA Foundation, who joined a chorus of concern about multicultural 
representation in arts management. 
</P>
<P>
"Responsibility is the central issue," said Tom Reese, associate director of 
the Getty Center of the History of Art and the Humanities. "Money is what 
boards understand" and they want to measure what they are getting for their 
money. This leads to administrators developing "mission statements" that 
outline their objectives. Then, they concern themselves about "the creation of 
a product" that fits the statement rather than working as free agents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Isolation in various guises is also an endemic problem, according to the 
speakers. Institutions have isolated themselves from artists because they are 
preoccupied with their own survival. Trustees are isolated from multicultural 
and community concerns. And the art world at large has not been accountable to 
a large audience. In times of financial and political stress these facts make 
it difficult for arts groups to speak from a position of unity and power, 
participants said. 
</P>
<P>
Problems seemed to be more apparent than solutions, however. 
</P>
<P>
Cee Scott Brown, director of Creative Time in New York, said that he prefers to 
get along without National Endowment for the Arts money -- considering its onus 
of censorship -- and suggested establishing an alternate fund. But most other 
speakers weren't ready to give up on the NEA or to accept the idea that the 
private sector could or should pick up the slack. Instead, they advocated 
restoring the endowment to an apolitical position or changing it so that it 
functions more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"The NEA belongs to the people . . . It's the stamp of national approval that 
puts art on the agenda," said Bella Lewitzky, director of the Bella Lewitzky 
Dance Company. Lewitzky turned down a $72,000 NEA grant rather than sign an 
anti-obscenity pledge and has filed suit against the agency. One of the 
endowment's major assets is that it has been "more objective" and less subject 
to petty politics than state or local arts councils, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Countering talk of gloom and doom, philanthropist Peter Norton said that loss 
of traditional support for the arts and an increase of censorship is a pendulum 
sweep that offers possibilities for positive change. "It's very unfashionable 
to be a white male now. Old fogies are on the run. We can't lose the custodians 
of money and power and not expect to have lost anything. Diversity has a price, 
but the decline of support from the old fogies is something we ought to 
celebrate. It is something we certainly ought to adjust to." 
</P>
<P>
A "lean time" may be "a better time" that will lead artists and institutions to 
"do more with less and do it better," Norton said. How to do it better was the 
subject of much questioning, however. Among the tentative, vague and admittedly 
flawed suggestions: establishing barter systems and revenue-raising ventures 
such as restaurants and artist-designed products, looking at the ways art is 
supported in other countries, making more creative use of percent-for-art 
monies and encouraging foundations to fund learning projects rather than 
exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
The National Gallery of Art in Washington came under fire from Hopkins, who 
suggested that the gallery's annual windfall of $40 million in government funds 
may not be the best use of that money. He questioned whether "the nation's art" 
should be "locked up in one museum" in the East and asked why the gallery 
doesn't charge admission to offset expenses as other museums must. 
</P>
<P>
The only consensus that emerged from the two-day meeting was a call for 
collaboration, and even that seems fraught with peril. Several participants 
pointed out that collaborative projects take more time and rarely satisfy 
anyone. They also reminded one another that artists are creative loners. 
</P>
<P>
But a hunkered-down mood -- along with heightened multicultural sensitivities 
-- led speakers to agree that a new, pervasive kind of cooperation is needed if 
the arts are to serve a larger public on a smaller budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Collaboration is our future," said arts advocate Joy Silverman. It was one of 
the few workshop pronouncements that went unchallenged.

A SHOW ON BEHALF OF ARTISTS' 'LIBERTIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 100 would-be artists got a chance to work alongside the real thing on 
Saturday at the Woman's Building. The event was the opening of "Taking 
Liberties," an exhibition by visual and performance artists whose work has come 
under fire for its political, sexual or religious content. 
</P>
<P>
For the exhibition, the artists created new works on the gallery walls during a 
3-hour "freedom of art-making marathon" in which audience members were welcome 
to join in by either creating their own art works or writing comments about the 
artists' works. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all about getting people to express themselves," said lesbian folk 
singer Phranc, who wrote the lyrics to her new song, "Dress Code," on one of 
the gallery walls. "Nobody can keep us from doing what we do no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
"Taking Liberties," on view through Dec. 28, includes works by noted artists 
active in the freedom-of-expression debate, including May Sun, Cheri Gaulke and 
Erika Rothenberg. According to Woman's Building artistic director Kathy Clark, 
the show comes at a time when some members of the arts community may be 
relenting in their pressure on foes such as Sen. Jesse Helms (R.-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to not just let the issue die because some concessions have 
been made," said Clark, referring to recent legislation affecting the National 
Endowment for the Arts. "It's still important to create a forum where reaction 
to potential oppressions of freedom of expression can be expressed." 
</P>
<P>
Gaulke, who photocopied her entire body to create a nude crucifix form on the 
gallery wall, called the event "an environment where the artists can 
deliberately not censor themselves." Gaulke's artwork, which contains 
strategically placed picture frames and is called "We Will Not Be Framed," grew 
out of her censorship-related performance piece, "Hey Jesse, You Ain't Seen 
Nothing Yet," in which she performs nude with frames around her breasts and 
pubic region. 
</P>
<P>
Also expanding on a previous work was Rothenberg, whose "What Some People Had 
to Say About Censorship (Melrose Ave., Sept., 1990)" grew out of a window 
installation she did at the Soap Plant store in September. During that 
installation, she provided books for passersby to write their comments. For her 
Woman's Building piece, she chose some of the most interesting comments -- such 
as "Given the choice between censorship and lobotomy, I'll take the lobotomy," 
and "If 'pro' is the opposite of 'con,' then it stands to reason that 
'progress' is the opposite of 'Congress,' " -- and posted them on the gallery 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
Also participating Saturday was visual artist Karen Atkinson, whose NEA-related 
show last May at Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies resulted in more 
than 20,000 pro-NEA postcards being sent to Congress and NEA committee members. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson's "Taking Liberties" exhibition expanded on her previous "Visionaries 
of Their Time" poster depicting Helms along with Joseph McCarthy and Adolf 
Hitler. At the Woman's Building, Helms is shown with such political figures as 
Ronald Reagan, Christopher Columbus, Saddam Hussein, Oliver North, John 
Frohnmayer, Dan Quayle and George Bush. "I want viewers to think about it and 
respond to me," said Atkinson, "whether they agree or not." 
</P>
<P>
Other artists participating in "Taking Liberties" include Mark Niblock, Rosalie 
Ortega, Johana Went, Terry Wolverton and Liz Young. A number of others, 
including visual artist Robbie Conal and performance artists Tim Miller and 
Rachel Rosenthal, did not participate Saturday because of scheduling conflicts, 
but may add works to the show later this week.

'LITTLE MATCH GIRL' HAS SOCIAL VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Little Match Girl" (at 7 tonight on HBO), a new animated special from 
producer/director Michael Sporn ("Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile"), transforms Hans 
Christian Andersen's bleak story about an unloved child freezing to death on a 
snowy night into a contemporary parable of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
It's New Year's Eve, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
Angela, the title character, lives with her mother and father in an abandoned 
New York subway station; she supports her kindly mother and father by selling 
matches to theatergoers in Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
On her way uptown, Angela, who looks like Ludwig Bemelmans' Madeline, befriends 
a stray dog, Albert. As they huddle in a vacant lot against the driving cold, 
she lights some of the matches, and is rewarded with visions of her favorite 
aunt, a friendly street musician and her grandmother, who take Angela and 
Albert on magical adventures in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Angela's plight touches the hearts of the uncaring rich people, who come to the 
aid of the homeless families in the subway station, ensuring that "the first 
day of the new age had a joyful beginning." 
</P>
<P>
In this unusually atmospheric special, Sporn depicts New York as a cold montage 
of dull blues and lavenders, with Angela's red coat providing the only spot of 
color. F. Murray Abraham's understated narration and the mournful saxophone 
solos in Caleb Sampson's jazz score emphasize the downbeat feeling of the 
uncaring metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
Its gently didactic social message makes "The Little Match Girl" a more 
valuable program for children and their parents to watch than the simple-minded 
tales of furry little animals "saving" Christmas that have become standard 
holiday fare. CHARLES SOLOMON

More State Trucking Firms Failing: The number of trucking company failures in 
California rose 11% the first three quarters of 1990, reversing a four-year 
downward trend, according to Dunn &amp; Bradstreet. 
</P>
<P>
About 130 carriers failed the first nine months, up from 117 last year. If the 
trend continues, there will be 175 failures this year, more than in any year 
since 1986, according to the California Trucking Assn. Last year there were 157 
failures. Carriers operating in the Los Angeles basin, where environmental 
regulation is strictest, are among the most vulnerable to failure, the 
association said.

Defense Fraud Plea: The operators of a Burbank firm that manufactured 
temperature transducers for the Army's Patriot missile pleaded guilty to 
charges of defrauding the government of $500,000 by padding bills for the 
components. Michael Martin Zarachoff, 45, and Nanci Plath, 42, both of 
Northridge, admitted to a federal court judge that they overcharged the 
government in contracts over a three-year period by establishing a shell 
company to falsify bills to their company, Temcom Inc. The shell company, 
however, never supplied any goods or services to Temcom or the government, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Zarachoff, Temcom's owner, pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy, 
lying to the government and tax evasion and faces up to 15 years in prison when 
he is sentenced. Plath, comptroller at the firm, pleaded guilty to one 
conspiracy charge, for which she is expected to receive probation. (Court Case 
No. 90-855. Plea entered Dec. 4, 1990).

ACTIVISTS FOR HOMELESS DECRY DISNEY DOLL

The Walt Disney Co. is known for wholesome movies, family theme parks and 
Mickey Mouse. Now the Burbank-based company may have a less attractive claim to 
fame. 
</P>
<P>
Its Steve the Tramp action figure -- inspired by the Dick Tracy movie -- has 
been ranked the year's most "warped" toy by an Episcopal priest. 
</P>
<P>
And this weekend, after a protest by activists for the homeless, a national toy 
store chain pulled the doll from its shelves. It called it "offensive" because 
of an insensitive description of the homeless character written on the package 
the toy comes in. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to believe this is the Walt Disney Co. that we all know and love," 
sighed Christopher Rose, a Hartford, Conn., Episcopal priest who put Steve the 
Tramp in the No. 1 position on his annual list of "Warped Toys for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Steve the Tramp, a Barbie-sized doll that is one of 14 action figures inspired 
by the Dick Tracy film, won the dubious distinction largely as the result of 
the description on its package. It calls the figure an "ignorant bum" and a 
"reeking piece of filth," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
But the description doesn't stop there. 
</P>
<P>
"Warning. Steve the Tramp will use and abuse any young helpless prey he comes 
across," the package reads. "Beware . . . Hardened and bitter after a life on 
the mean streets, Steve the Tramp is a lout who would just as soon take your 
life as your wallet. Despite his low I.Q., he is as dangerous as they come 
because he doesn't have anything to lose." 
</P>
<P>
And if that wasn't enough: "You'll smell him before you see him," the package 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The figure, which is licensed by Burbank-based Disney, is manufactured by 
Playmates Toys of La Mirada. Neither Disney nor Playmates officials could be 
reached for comment Sunday. However, Disney defended the toy in a statement, 
saying that it was "not intended in any way to represent the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Kay-Bee Toy &amp; Hobby, a chain of 1,200 stores, pulled the toy from its 
shelves this weekend after its vice president of advertising, Ken Cunniff, 
determined that "the copy on the package goes too far." 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time I read it," Cunniff told the Stamford Advocate in 
Stamford, Conn. "And I was offended. . . . We do have a social conscience 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The doll apparently was not a big seller anyway. Several Kay-Bee toy stores in 
the Los Angeles area said they have never had it in stock. 
</P>
<P>
And Toys R Us in Cerritos said it recently marked down its stock of Dick Tracy 
action figures, including Steve the Tramp, to $1.98 from the original price of 
$4.99. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have sales figures, but I suppose that tells you something," a Toys R 
Us clerk added. 
</P>
<P>
Rose said the doll was this year's most offensive because of its psychological 
impact on children. 
</P>
<P>
Several others, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' "Flushomatic High-tech 
Toilet Torture Trap" and the Beetlejuice "Shish Kebab" doll, which is designed 
to be stabbed and decapitated, also ranked high on the "warped" list. 
</P>
<P>
"These toys desensitize kids to the pain and suffering of other people," Rose 
said. "They also have very little play value after you've done the violent 
things with them."

JAPAN LIKELY WINNER IN 'SMART' FACTORY PLAN

<P>
Scientists and civil servants from the world's biggest industrial nations met 
last month to start searching for a design for the "factory of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Most support the idea. But will it work? And if it does, who will benefit? 
</P>
<P>
Many experts believe that the Japanese will be the commercial winners by 
efficiently exploiting the ideas of other participants. 
</P>
<P>
Computers in the highly automated, "intelligent" factory will rapidly design 
and help produce high-quality goods for industries ranging from brewing to 
aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing will be elevated to a science, and workers will rise from factory 
floors to computer consoles. 
</P>
<P>
Some 150 American and 80 Japanese companies have expressed interest in turning 
this vision into reality, with delegates from Japan, the United States, the 
12-nation European Community and other countries attending last month's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
They agreed that international collaboration was the best route to intelligent 
manufacturing but said there would be at least two years of preparation before 
the project could begin. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been tremendous progress, and the prospects are bright," said 
Katsujiro Kida of Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry. 
</P>
<P>
According to delegates, the crux of the talks was how to ensure equal benefits 
to each member of the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
But some members say the attempt is futile because they believe that no matter 
how well the consortium is organized, the Japanese will gain the commercial 
upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
Even Hiroyuki Yoshikawa, dean of Tokyo University's faculty of engineering and 
the brain behind Japan's Intelligent Manufacturing System proposal, said there 
were barriers to Westerners seeking access to Japanese technology. 
</P>
<P>
In remarks to U.S. and EC officials, he said foreigners would be at a 
disadvantage because so few speak Japanese. Many suffer from a "not invented 
here" syndrome, which hinders their recognition of significant Japanese work. 
</P>
<P>
The self-effacing reluctance of Japanese to speak about themselves is another 
obstacle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizational factors may be even more important, many Western delegates said. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese corporations are better built to fuse ideas from research, development 
and marketing divisions and quickly turn them into product. Researchers in the 
West tend to be more concerned with pure research, making a creative 
breakthrough and publishing new knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Japanese researchers are more likely to focus on achieving 
commercial success for their firms rather than boosting their own academic 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"The system as a whole is more inclined to focus on products and how to create 
them by improving existing technologies -- rather than on a breakthrough," said 
Stefan Speidel of the Japanese subsidiary of Germany's Siemens AG. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates agreed that funding be proportioned equally and balanced by region 
and the character of collaborating institutions. And they agreed to let legal 
experts work out knotty questions over things such as intellectual property 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
An executive committee is likely to oversee all the parts of the project, 
making sure they are agreed to unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
This is a key provision for those concerned about Japan taking advantage of 
others' ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"We must prevent a Japanese company from working directly with a European 
university," said an EC delegate. His fear is that Japanese firms would reap 
the commercial harvest of basic technologies developed in the West but not yet 
applied. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. companies are resigned to letting the Japanese have the upper hand, 
said one member of the U.S. delegation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible the Japanese will get more out of it. But if we don't join, how 
else could we learn to work in international projects?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although international cooperation is common in fields such as nuclear fusion, 
medicine and other scientific areas, it is unprecedented on a large scale in 
applied technology. 
</P>
<P>
The smart manufacturing process could set a precedent in international 
cooperation for tackling environmental pollution and other problems.

JAPAN PLANS A TAX TO CURB LAND PRICES; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: IN TOKYO A SQUARE FOOT CAN BRING $26,850. BUT SOME SAY THE GOVERNMENT 
PROPOSAL IS TOO WATERED DOWN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

<P>
Japan's ruling party plans to introduce an unprecedented tax to curb soaring 
land prices, which have more than doubled in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
But some market experts say the proposed measure is so weak it is hardly worth 
bothering with. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party decided last week to set an annual 
landholding tax of 0.2% of the estimated value of a property, starting in 1992. 
The plan would raise the tax to 0.3% the following year, party sources said. 
The rate is expected to be reviewed every five years. 
</P>
<P>
The LDP is expected to include the new tax plan and other measures in a package 
aimed at controlling land prices. The package will be submitted as a government 
bill to Parliament, which is to open its regular session today. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has vowed to tackle the problem of soaring land 
prices, which have made some individuals wealthy but have also caused great 
concern among average wage earners and businesses alike. 
</P>
<P>
But economists say the basic rate of 0.3% is far below the 1% that they believe 
is necessary to drive down land prices by more than 20% during the next several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The party's new plan would allow many exemptions, so its effect would be 
minimal, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposed new landholding tax was so heavily watered down that it would not 
have much effect in cutting land prices," a senior economist at a major bank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The landholding tax is aimed at a small number of big corporations, and it 
lacks fairness," Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Assn. of Corporate 
Executives, told a news conference after announcement of the plan. The group is 
one of Japan's four major economic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Under the party's formula, a plot valued at less than $7.5 million is exempt 
from the tax. The party also proposes exemptions for housing land of less than 
10,800 square feet, farmland, forests and land used for public purposes such as 
medical care and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of land in Tokyo is about $860 a square foot. But in the 
central Ginza district, the Times Square of Tokyo, it is valued at $26,850 a 
square foot. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, land in mid-town Manhattan in New York City can range from as 
little as $500 a square foot up to $3,000 or more, experts say. But prices are 
hard to peg because of the extremely weak market. 
</P>
<P>
Land prices in urban areas of Japan rose an average of 7.3% in the six months 
ended Sept. 30, after an 8.3% rise the previous six months, according to the 
Real Estate Institute, a trade group. This was the first slowdown in the rate 
of increase since early in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
When the idea of a tax was raised in October, several members of the ruling 
party voiced strong opposition because the tax was aimed at corporations. The 
corporate sector is a generous supporter of the Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The corporations have unleashed a torrent of criticism against the idea of a 
landholding tax, which they say would impose a disproportionate burden on 
property-rich firms. 
</P>
<P>
Political opposition might make it hard for the party to push the new tax 
through both houses of Parliament, economists said. The ruling party suffered a 
historic defeat in upper-house elections last year mainly because of public 
anger over a sales tax introduced in April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the tax passes, some experts are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"A new tax is a good idea for controlling land prices, but it would have 
limited impact if its implementation were incomplete," Masaru Takagi, chief 
economist at Fuji Bank, said before the measure was formally proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Land prices would fall 3% to 4% if the tax were 0.5%, said a recent report by 
the Mitsui Research Institute, which is affiliated with Mitsui Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts say land prices probably will fall gradually in the next few 
years even if no tax is imposed.

More than 200 people, many with candles in hand, marched through the streets of 
downtown San Diego Sunday in a symbolic rebuff of what many view as a rising 
anti-immigrant sentiment throughout Southern California. The candlelight walk 
was also designed as a counterpoint to the ongoing Light Up the Border 
protests, in which U.S. motorists here shine their headlights toward Mexico as 
an act of protest against illegal immigration. Meanwhile, in the 
Calexico-Mexicali border area, demonstrators planned a separate candlelight 
march Sunday in honor of victims of violence along the U.S.-Mexico frontier.

The Richmond school board has ousted Supt. Walter Marks amid concern that he 
was jeopardizing the district's chances of getting a second emergency bailout 
loan from the state. 
</P>
<P>
The district could run out of money by next February, one state legislator 
said. The district, which faces an estimated $25-million shortfall for next 
year, received a $9-million loan from the state earlier this year and is forced 
to ask for an additional $25 million. "The consensus of opinion was that if we 
were going to have a good shot of seeing this loan, Marks would have to go," 
said Assemblyman Robert J. Campbell (D-Richmond), who called the district "the 
worst example of a public agency not being run well."

"I know every time that door opens I (look up) and see who it is that just

California's drought-stricken farmers could see their state water supplies cut 
by two-thirds during 1991, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Water Resources said in an annual December letter to its 
long-term contractors that farmers may receive only 35% of their allocated 
supplies next year, while municipal and industrial customers could expect 85%. 
"We're saying that if we have a critically dry year from now on, this is how 
much we'll be able to deliver," said Don Long, the department's top water 
project analyst. During 1990, farmers had been told they would receive 50% of 
their expected supplies, a figure that later improved during the year as 
unexpected rains made more water available.

USC'S SAMPLE BRINGS IMAGE OF A HARD-DRIVING MAN; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: HE PUSHED SUNY BUFFALO INTO THE BIG LEAGUES. HIS ATTENTION TO 
STUDENTS, FACULTY IS QUESTIONED.

BUFFALO, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Especially on a slushy winter day, the stark and modernistic campus of the 
State University of New York seems about as far as you can get in American 
academia from the rosy-brick quadrangles and bicycle paths at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Many classroom buildings at SUNY Buffalo are connected with second-story 
walkways so students and teachers can avoid the infamous snowstorms that blow 
in from Lake Erie. Nowhere can be seen a skateboard or a Frisbee. Nowhere is 
there a statue commemorating althlete-warriors overlooking sunny lawns. 
</P>
<P>
The differences are not just climate and architecture. SUNY Buffalo is a public 
institution in a state dominated by liberals while USC is a private school with 
a conservative ethos. From a suburban location, SUNY Buffalo is the dominant 
university in an economically depressed region while distinctly urban USC 
competes for academic respect in vibrant Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Yet now the schools have something in common: Steven B. Sample. SUNY Buffalo's 
president since 1982, Sample is to become president of USC on March 31, it was 
announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
Sample will bring cross-country a reputation as an immensely energetic 
administrator who pushed SUNY Buffalo into the big league of research grants 
and honors. He will carry to a much larger city an image of someone who enjoyed 
being a civic power player for the community's betterment. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he also leaves some bitterness as a president who, critics charge, favored 
expensive projects to generate publicity, while not paying enough attention to 
daily concerns of students and faculty. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a gunner, really in a positive way. If there are things to be stirred up 
in the positive sense, Steven Sample will do it," said William Miller, the 
dental school professor who is chairman of SUNY Buffalo's faculty senate. "Even 
his detractors admit he's been a very good president. He's made us aware of 
what we can be. Not only that, but he's got us moving in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
His aides depict Sample, 50, as a hard-driving man who disrupts their personal 
lives with late-night and weekend telephone calls on university issues. They 
describe him as a fast tracker, someone who earned a doctorate in electrical 
engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana at age 24, had a tenured 
professorship at Purdue by 29, was second in command at the University of 
Nebraska at 33, became a SUNY president at 41 and has been head-hunted by 
several schools other than USC recently. But, even with the pressure, they said 
working with him has been fun. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. Wagner, SUNY Buffalo's vice president for university services, 
advises USC staff to take vacations before Sample comes West "because once he 
gets there, it's going to be nonstop. It's a high commitment but Steve doesn't 
ask you to do something he doesn't do himself." 
</P>
<P>
Many people in Buffalo say Sample and USC are a good match, despite the fact 
that Sample's entire education and career have been at state schools. They say 
he has been chafing at the bit for years to run a university without the 
oversight and politics involved in a state system of many campuses. His 
feelings reportedly became more acute as New York entered its current budget 
crunch. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose that private universities have money problems too. But the chain of 
command is different," explained M. Robert Koren, the attorney who is chairman 
of SUNY Buffalo's local governing board. And it's not that Sample doesn't know 
how to lobby politicians well, he added. "If we have to sell something, he can 
sell it without leaving anyone mad," Koren explained. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, his friends say Sample's Midwestern roots and corporate demeanor 
will make him more at home at USC than at a school which in the '70s overtly 
strove to become the "Berkeley of the East" in more ways than one. Sample says 
he has no political affiliation and that any depiction of SUNY Buffalo as 
politically radical is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"In some respects, there is probably more congruence between Steve Sample the 
person and the students and faculty at USC than here," said Robert H. Rossberg, 
Buffalo's interim dean of arts and letters. "He is essentially a conservative 
and traditionalist and this campus tends to be left of center. Sometimes the 
students here shocked him and he did a good job of hiding it." 
</P>
<P>
For example, the law school faculty and students in 1988 tried to stop the U.S. 
Marines from recruiting young lawyers on campus because of military rules 
against homosexuals. Last May, Sample ruled that federal and state laws 
sanction those military policies and that he could not deny recruiters their 
freedom of speech and action. In response, law students filed a still pending 
complaint with the the New York State Division on Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
His staff says Sample's handling of the matter was telling. His ruling was a 
carefully researched, 15-page document issued during spring exams when the 
school newspaper was closed and protests were difficult to organize. "He is an 
engineer, not a philosopher," said one high-ranking dean. He likened Sample's 
methodical approach in policy questions to the way the university president 
earned five patents for electrical inventions, including a control device used 
in millions of microwave ovens. 
</P>
<P>
To the annoyance of some other SUNY leaders, Sample seems at times to hide the 
fact that his campus is part of the 64-campus SUNY system. He refers to the 
school as the University at Buffalo or UB, with no SUNY in the title, partly in 
recognition that the school was private before 1962. And, Sample repeatedly 
describes his university as state-assisted, not state-supported, a reference to 
the fact that nonstate funds for research and programs have tripled during his 
presidency and now make up about half of the school's budget. 
</P>
<P>
That boost in research dollars was key to SUNY Buffalo's gaining membership 
last year in the Assn. of American Universities, the organization of top 
research schools, now numbering 58, including USC. 
</P>
<P>
But the emphasis also earned Sample criticism. For example, a recent survey 
answered by about 40% of tenured professors said that Sample did a fair to poor 
job in encouraging faculty who don't bring in outside money. The Sample 
administration called the survey unscientific and reflective mainly of 
disgruntled employees. 
</P>
<P>
"There were all sorts of flash-bang research grant money. But many of us feel 
that undergraduate teaching, despite what Sample says, did not take the front 
seat," said Harvey Axlerod, president of United University Professions, the 
faculty and staff union. "I would say he polished his gems and let the rest get 
dusty." 
</P>
<P>
Among those gems is the national earthquake research center, which SUNY Buffalo 
and other New York schools won, with much controversy, over California 
universities in 1986. Another is the World University Games, an international 
collegiate sports competition, which Buffalo will host in 1993, much of it 
played at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Sample also fought hard to upgrade sports and bring a fraternity row to SUNY 
Buffalo -- features so entrenched at USC that they help define the place. After 
failing in 1984, Sample helped win approval from SUNY trustees two years later 
to allow athletic scholarships. SUNY Buffalo, as a result, is in the midst of 
moving its teams from Division III to high-profile Division I. But Sample lost 
a campaign to use state bonds and campus property to build homes for sororities 
and fraternities, now scattered off campus. 
</P>
<P>
Both efforts, he said, were geared to improve student life. SUNY Buffalo is 
universally conceded to be a sterile place of high-rise dormitories and 
labyrinth classroom buildings seemingly designed to avoid much socializing 
among its 27,000 students, about the same enrollment as USC. 
</P>
<P>
Given that USC already ranks nationally in the top 25 schools for research 
spending and has a vibrant student and sports life, what are Sample's plans for 
it? 
</P>
<P>
His Buffalo provost, William Greiner, said that USC probably appealed to Sample 
because it feels it is the academic underdog to cross-town rival UCLA. "In New 
York, what counted were the privates (schools) like Cornell, Columbia, NYU, 
Hamilton. UB and SUNY were underdogs nine years ago," Greiner explained. "We 
may not be on the same level in all matters as Cornell now but we sure as hell 
compete. His challenge is to make USC be taken as seriously as UCLA or 
Berkeley. Give him a few years and he'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
Student leaders complain that Sample was too remote, too involved in off-campus 
activities. But they add he has become more accessible since students tried to 
storm his office in September in a protest over fees for previously free bus 
service. "That was the biggest thing on campus in 20 years," recalled Ian 
Aronson, editor-in-chief of the campus newspaper, the Spectrum. "And it seemed 
to have surprised him." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Sahner, president of the undergraduate association, said she respects 
Sample very much and hopes he carries to USC the lesson of the fee protest -- 
stay close to student concerns. "Maybe the balmy weather will loosen him up," 
Sahner quipped. "I sometimes joke that maybe he thinks if he loosens his tie 
his head will fall off." 
</P>
<P>
Sample was back in his Buffalo office Friday after two days of ceremonial 
meetings in Los Angeles, where his USC appointment was announced Wednesday. 
Looking rested despite the rush of events, he was wearing his signature dark 
suit and tie. He joked with a reporter who previously described him as slim, to 
the great amusement of Sample's family. The president unbuttoned his jacket and 
pinched a stomach not noticeable before and proceeded to sip a glass of what he 
said was very low-calorie water. 
</P>
<P>
Sample said he took comments about his alleged distance from students as 
favorable to him: "It means they want to see me more." He stressed it is 
difficult for any university president to devote as much time as he would like 
to meetings with students and faculty. Besides, he added: "The essential 
relationship of a university is between teacher and student, not university 
president to student politician, not president to faculty, not faculty to 
faculty." The recent establishment of honors seminars for undergraduates and a 
new program to strengthen freshmen curricula at Buffalo were designed to 
strengthen that link to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted it is still too early to announce any plans for USC. But he 
conceded that the USC trustees "very much want USC's reputation raised 
nationally and internationally as a center of institutional excellence." USC 
trustees want Sample to work also on social and economic problems in the 
neighborhoods just outside the campus boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty of both challenges in Southern California may have been 
reinforced when UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young and Caltech President Thomas 
E. Everhart telephoned Friday to offer congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
"I really have a lot of learning to do, I mean a lot, about USC, about Los 
Angeles, about Southern California," Sample said shortly afterward. "It is a 
very complex and exciting urban environment. . . . I hope to learn from Chuck 
(Young) and Tom (Everhart) about some of the things the research universities 
can do for Los Angeles and Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
In Buffalo, Sample was the only nonbusinessman in the so-called Group of 18, a 
committee of powerful leaders working, with some success, to lift Buffalo from 
the collapse of its smokestack industries to a future of high technology and 
free trade with Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"Buffalo suffers from an image problem. So to have a university that claims to 
be one of the top research universities in the country is a big deal," said 
Stanford Lipsey, publisher of the Buffalo News, and himself a member of the 
Group of 18. According to Lipsey, Sample "knows how to round up a consensus, 
politically and financially, and knows how to do it with grace." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, English professor George Hochfield said such ties with the 
establishment did little to aid education. "All the businessmen in town, all 
the politicians, all the self- nominated big shots all embraced Sample. But 
what do they know about intellectual life?" asked Hochfield, who has sharply 
criticized SUNY Buffalo's move to Division I sports and the centralized nature 
of the Sample administration. Hochfield alleged that Sample is overly 
interested in public relations and his own career advancement. 
</P>
<P>
A modern university has a responsibility to help society, countered Sample. 
And, he says he never took claim for SUNY Buffalo's improved reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've made it possible for other people to bring about change and work 
for excellence and make it possible for us to be more competitive as a 
university. I would describe myself as more of a facilitator of change than a 
director of change," said the man who will become USC's 10th president. "What I 
really like about this kind of work is to see an idea that is struggling to be 
born and help make it happen. That's really satisfying."

WALESA HEADED FOR LANDSLIDE POLISH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WARSAW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lech Walesa, the shipyard electrician who led Poland's fight against Communist 
rule for the last decade, was elected president Sunday by a landslide margin, 
according to partial, official returns that showed him winning by 77%. 
</P>
<P>
Exit polls projected that Walesa would maintain that 77%, decisively trouncing 
his mysterious dark-horse opponent, Polish emigre and Canadian businessman 
Stanislaw Tyminski. The exit polls projected a vote of 23% for Tyminski. 
</P>
<P>
It was the country's first popular presidential election. In free elections 
before World War II, Poland's presidents were always elected by Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Among jubilant supporters at his hometown headquarters in Gdansk, Walesa, 47, 
and his wife Danuta, raised glasses of champagne. "I am aware that we face 
difficult tasks," Walesa said. "But if we managed to overcome the previous 
system without firing a shot, without blood being spilled, then we can dare to 
build another one. We have 10 years of experience." 
</P>
<P>
At his headquarters in Warsaw, Tyminski said he was "surprised" by the result. 
"I expected to get about 50%," he said. He also charged that the "situation was 
dangerous" and that his supporters were "terrorized" and "beaten up." 
</P>
<P>
Tyminski, 42, left Poland 21 years ago and established businesses in Canada and 
Peru. His second-place finish in the first round of voting two weeks ago, when 
he knocked Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki out of the running, threw a deep 
scare into the country's political establishment. In the ensuing campaign for 
Sunday's runoff election, Tyminski came under intense scrutiny over his alleged 
ties with former Communists and secret police operatives, his vague economic 
ideas and his assertions that mystical experiences among Peruvian Indians had 
given him access to a "fourth dimension" of reality. 
</P>
<P>
While Tyminski never explained how the "fourth dimension" might benefit Poland, 
commentators, noting his expressionless face and icy stare, suggested that he 
was adept at self-hypnosis. One British journalist called him "the candidate 
from 'Twin Peaks.' " 
</P>
<P>
The brief Tyminski phenomenon, which Walesa referred to as "an accident on the 
road to democracy," had the effect of pulling together, at least temporarily, 
the split factions of Solidarity, pulled asunder by the often bitter campaign 
battle between Mazowiecki and Walesa. Virtually all the important figures in 
the Mazowiecki camp, led by the prime minister himself, endorsed Walesa in the 
runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The triumph for Walesa is the culmination of a remarkable career. Born in a 
shack at the edge of a bog in northern Poland, one of seven children in his 
impoverished family, Walesa's formal education ended with a trade school course 
in auto mechanics. He left home at the age of 24 and went to work in the Lenin 
Shipyards in Gdansk. Within a short time, he was agitating against poor working 
conditions. He was fired from the shipyard in 1976 for criticizing the 
Communist unions, but he continued his agitations underground, convinced that 
it would be possible, one day, to organize free trade unions. The chance came 
in 1980, with the outbreak of a strike in the shipyard. In a move he refers to 
often, the unemployed Walesa jumped the shipyard fence to join the strikers. 
Within days, he was leading them. 
</P>
<P>
When Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law in December, 1981, 
Solidarity was banned and Walesa was jailed for a year. In July, 1983, martial 
law was lifted. That same year, Walesa received the Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
Through most of the deep gloom that settled over Poland in the post-martial law 
period, scores of underground activists kept Solidarity alive, and Walesa, more 
than any other figure, was its voice to the outside world. Beginning with a 
series of strikes in 1988, Solidarity rose again, with Walesa leading a deft 
series of negotiations that legalized the trade union, thus setting the stage 
for elections that would spell doom for the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of those elections, it was Walesa who pushed the cautious 
Solidarity brain trust, composed of Mazowiecki and other opposition 
intellectuals, to form a government. Walesa handpicked Mazowiecki to take the 
premiership. It was a step that foreshadowed six months of revolution in 
Eastern Europe in which hard-line Communist regimes surrendered power in 
Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and, finally, Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Causes of the Communist collapse included an apparently endless economic crisis 
and the reforms brought about by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Soviet 
Union, although the determination of Walesa in Poland was seen as a major 
catalytic force. Walesa did not take a role in the new government and declined 
to run for Parliament, and it was obvious to Poles that Walesa was waiting for 
the presidency. Under the negotiated arrangement with the Communists, the 
presidency went to Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party leader. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Gdansk, Walesa's only official role was as the leader of Solidarity, 
but he acted very much as a president-in-waiting, receiving streams of visiting 
dignitaries, foreign ministers and heads of state. At the same time, 
Solidarity's liberal wing, most of it either in or close to the government, 
began sniping at Walesa as a "loose cannon" and an "autocrat," clearly aiming 
to ambush Walesa's obvious presidential ambitions, setting the stage for an 
acrimonious campaign that has taken up virtually the whole of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa made "acceleration" his slogan for the campaign, arguing that the dead 
wood of Communist bureaucracy, still clogging the middle or upper-middle levels 
of industry and government, needs to be cleaned out. He painted his old ally, 
Mazowiecki, as dedicated but too cautious. 
</P>
<P>
It was a view the electorate appeared to share. Mazowiecki received only 17% of 
the vote in the first round, coming in third behind Tyminski. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa will now have the task of making good on his word to speed up Polish 
reforms, while laying to rest apprehensions over his autocratic style of 
leadership. Mazowiecki and other Solidarity liberals, forming a new alliance of 
political parties, have pledged to create a watchful opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's new president could be sworn in as early as Wednesday. Jaruzelski, 
whose 1981 decree sent Walesa to jail for a year, would relinquish the post the 
moment Walesa is sworn in.

CORONADO'S BID TO BAR TOUR BUSES GETS STRANDED ON THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

CORONADO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If diesel smoke was all that tour buses spewed, Coronado residents might 
consider backing down. It's the annoying patter that they say they're sick to 
death of -- the running commentary, blared over the buses' public address 
systems, lecturing paying passengers about one of San Diego County's most 
exclusive communities. 
</P>
<P>
"They slow down and they say, 'Now look. This is where all the rich folks live. 
Well, now this is where the Duchess of Windsor lived. Now you see in the 
driveway the Jaguars or the Mercedeses or the BMWs,' " said Doris Pray, a 
grandmother whose 27 years in Coronado have made her an expert on tour bus 
prattle. 
</P>
<P>
Such gawking is harassment, Pray and other Coronadans say. And these days -- at 
least since September, when the Coronado City Council passed an ordinance to 
bar tour buses from most streets except state highways -- it is against the 
law. At least, technically. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities, like Beverly Hills, for example, have laws limiting tour bus 
routes. But Coronado's attempt has a peculiar wrinkle. 
</P>
<P>
The state Coastal Commission is concerned that in limiting tour bus routes the 
city also has inadvertently limited coastal access in violation of the state 
Coastal Act. Until a ruling is obtained on that question, the Coastal 
Commission has stopped Coronado from enforcing its law. 
</P>
<P>
But Coastal Commissioner David Malcolm says he already has made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a basically white community saying, Stay out!" said Malcolm, who has 
earned the enmity of some Coronadans by opposing several proposals he finds 
"exclusionary." Malcolm, who is also a councilman in the largely Latino city of 
Chula Vista, says the Coronado sensibility goes something like this: "God 
forbid someone from out of town and from a minority race would come into our 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Coronado's civic leaders deny that racism has tainted their policy-making. But 
they admit that ever since the tiny 6-square-mile island city seceded from San 
Diego in 1891, it has struggled to keep its distance from its larger mainland 
neighbor. Especially since 1969, when the elegant 2.23-mile San Diego-Coronado 
Bay Bridge linked the two cities for the first time, residents have chafed at 
the resulting surge in traffic -- and, some say, crime -- on their orderly, 
tree-lined streets. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Malcolm says, city leaders seem to be working harder than 
ever to keep out-of-towners at bay. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, when the California Transportation Commission considered scrapping 
the $1 toll on the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge, Coronado Mayor Mary Herron 
successfully lobbied to extend the toll until 1995. While it had more than met 
its original goal -- paying back nearly $48 million in construction bonds -- 
the toll had other merits, Herron argued. By discouraging sightseers, she said, 
it kept Coronado's traffic in check. 
</P>
<P>
Then the city came up with a plan to create residents-only decal parking zones 
on a section of shoreline near the North Island Naval Air Station. The city 
said it needed the zones because Navy employees' vehicles often block residents 
from parking near their homes. But Malcolm and Coastal Commission Chairman 
Thomas W. Gwyn cried foul and are appealing the ordinance on the basis that it 
limits beach access. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the tour bus ordinance, which would keep most commercial buses from 
traveling the city's most scenic coastal routes. In addition, the ordinance 
would force buses that drop passengers at the area's biggest tourist 
attraction, the historic Hotel del Coronado, to travel five extra miles down 
the Silver Strand peninsula simply to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado is not the first California city to try to regulate tour bus traffic. 
In 1976, sick of being overrun by star-gazers, Beverly Hills banned commercial 
sightseeing vehicles weighing three tons or more from traveling on most 
residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which withstood challenges in the state Supreme Court, sought to 
eliminate what it called "all nature of nuisances . . . such as trespassing, 
knocking on doors, littering, trampling on shrubbery and flower beds, using the 
shrubbery for toilet purposes, making loud and raucous noises, removing items 
as souvenirs and generally disturbing the peace and privacy of the residents, 
most of whom are not celebrities." 
</P>
<P>
When Malcolm heard that Coronado was going to follow suit, he says he could 
only wonder what would come next. "A wall around the city? A drawbridge?" 
</P>
<P>
"What gives Coronado the right to say people can't go up and down the 
waterfront?" he asked, rejecting as absurd the charge, leveled by some 
Coronadans, that he is a shill for the tour bus industry. 
</P>
<P>
Pray, who has made the anti-bus fight a personal crusade, says it is a matter 
of human decency. Given the buses' long history of wrongdoing, she said, 
something has to change. 
</P>
<P>
At a public hearing last week, tour bus operators said the ordinance will 
create an economic hardship, adding 15 minutes to their routes and forcing 
passengers to endure repetitive views. But when Coronado's mayor suggested to 
her constituents that they increase their chances of winning Coastal Commission 
approval by considering alternatives to the ordinance, 11 residents rose, one 
by one, to say no. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the buses continue to roll unrestricted through town, gushing 
well-rehearsed flackery as they go. Among the highlights: a church with Tiffany 
windows, the house where Wallace Simpson lived before she married the duke, and 
the spot where Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis filmed "Some Like It 
Hot" at the grand Hotel Del. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the inspiration for the Emerald City in the Wizard of Oz," said Old 
Town Trolley tour bus driver Midge Crockett as she turned off the highway, 
hurtled down a quiet residential street and parked at a shorefront bus stop 
that the ordinance would abolish. 
</P>
<P>
"And this," she said, "is the most beautiful beach in California."

HEART OF RIVERSIDE 'HELD HOSTAGE' WITH DELAY IN MISSION INN REOPENING; 
</P>
<P>
LANDMARK: THE HISTORIC HOTEL WAS REPOSSESSED DURING A FIVE-YEAR RENOVATION AND 
THE BANK IS SEEKING A BUYER.

RIVERSIDE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smog obscures the mountain views and developers have uprooted most of the 
orange groves, but progress has spared at least one enduring emblem of 
Riverside's past -- the whimsical, beloved establishment known as the Mission 
Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Sprawled across a full square block in the heart of downtown, the eclectic 
87-year-old hotel has for decades been not only a magnet for rich and famous 
visitors but a cherished meeting, eating and shopping hub for the local 
populace as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our city's No. 1 landmark," said Art Pick, president of the Riverside 
Chamber of Commerce and a former city councilman. "It has a charm, 
architectural style and ambience that are irresistible . . . and truly felt 
throughout town." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the badly deteriorated inn closed for renovations amid a mood of 
optimistic anticipation. A three-year rehabilitation, its owners and city 
officials pledged at the time, would deliver a rejuvenated property guaranteed 
to revive the community's flagging downtown. 
</P>
<P>
But a half-decade has passed, and Riverside is still waiting for the rebirth. 
The inn's owner went bankrupt in 1988, and the property was seized by Chemical 
Bank of New York. Reluctant to enter the hotel business, the bank is 
aggressively peddling its unusual property, but has had no luck. 
</P>
<P>
Now, encircled by a chain-link fence and posted with no trespassing signs, the 
historic inn sits entirely restored but still shuttered and silent. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences have been painful. An assortment of merchants who banked on 
the hotel's renaissance and opened shops downtown have failed or relocated, 
while some who remain are struggling. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents have lost the habit of shopping downtown, while a wait-and-see 
attitude among jittery property owners has left the center city area pockmarked 
by large, vacant structures. 
</P>
<P>
It is, as one local business owner remarked, as if the rest of downtown 
Riverside has been "held hostage" by the fate of one building. 
</P>
<P>
"The downtown is a wonderful place, but when the Mission Inn closed, it was 
like the spirit just faded right out," said Lanette Bodiford, who owns a plant 
shop on Main Street, about 100 yards from the inn. "People keep hanging on and 
hanging on, but this is life and death for us. This can't continue." 
</P>
<P>
City redevelopment officials have been pressing forward with a slate of 
downtown residential and office projects, but they are equally impatient for 
the inn's reemergence. 
</P>
<P>
"The cornerstone of the downtown is the Mission Inn," said development director 
Margueretta Gulati. "It puts Riverside on the map. . . . There are many 
exciting things happening downtown, but for everything to come together, the 
reopening of the inn is absolutely critical." 
</P>
<P>
Chemical Bank insists relief is near. The $45-million renovation is complete -- 
there are even linens on the beds in some of its 240 rooms -- and spokeswoman 
Joyce Oberdorf said the bank is negotiating "pretty seriously" with one 
prospective buyer. 
</P>
<P>
She declined to identify the would-be purchaser, but city officials said a 
Japanese investment group is the leading prospect. A major issue is the buyer's 
desire for an inn-affiliated golf course, and the city has assisted in the hunt 
for possible sites. 
</P>
<P>
The recession and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, however, have combined to toss 
a wild card into the negotiations, something Oberdorf characterized as "a 
hesitancy to make a long-term commitment." To entice suitors, Chemical has 
lifted its $28-million minimum on offers for the inn and indicated it will 
provide performance guarantees to the purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
"We've said in the past we hope to have an agreement on the sale by the end of 
the year, and we still think that's feasible," Oberdorf said. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown business owners -- weary of promises and disappointments -- aren't 
marking their calendars. Al Blum, manager of a Main Street wine shop called 
Purple Toes, said merchants stopped "holding their breath" long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We opened in November of 1988 -- one month before the Mission Inn was supposed 
to have its grand reopening," Blum said. "We're still waiting." 
</P>
<P>
Purple Toes' owners have had a license to operate a wine-tasting bar on the 
premises for two years. But, without the inn, Blum said there's no incentive to 
open it: "Aside from the office lunch crowd, there's really nobody around down 
here. It's not even safe at night." 
</P>
<P>
Jim and Elizabeth Winner launched Aroma Cafe, a coffee roasting business and 
restaurant, just before the Mission Inn closed for renovations. Elizabeth 
Winner said the couple knew the early going would be rocky, but "we certainly 
didn't expect the inn to be closed five years. It's been a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
For Bodiford, an eight-year veteran of downtown Riverside, survival depends on 
installing and maintaining plants in local office buildings. Without those 
accounts, which bring in half the income, her Friends of Earth plant shop 
"would never be making it" downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The history of the Mission Inn is nearly as remarkable as the building itself, 
full of unexpected twists and turns. The inn was built in 1903 by entrepreneur 
Frank Augustus Miller, whose family had run a rooming house on the site in the 
late 1800s. Miller, eyeing the droves of wealthy Easterners who were wintering 
in places such as Redlands and Pasadena, aimed to create a grand and 
competitive resort amid the aromatic orange blossoms of Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the Mission Wing, Miller gradually built a hotel that 
Riverside's deputy development director, Ralph Megna, calls "an architect's 
Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
There are grand arches and fake adobe walls reminiscent of the California 
mission style, mixed in with a replica of the St. Francis of Assisi chapel -- 
complete with Tiffany windows, carved Belgian pews and a gold leaf altar. 
Spiral staircases wind up through a rotunda graced with hand-painted tiles, and 
balconies off some guest rooms -- no two of which are alike -- offer views of 
fountains, palm-studded courtyards and the city beyond. 
</P>
<P>
In its early years, the inn's charm was enhanced by the art, furnishings and 
memorabilia Miller lugged home from his many voyages around the world. The 
collection -- now housed in a museum at the inn -- includes numerous Buddhas, 
800 bells and life-sized wax figurines of a Pope and his court. 
</P>
<P>
"He saw the inn not just as a hotel but as an opportunity to bring culture to 
the hinterlands of Southern California," said historian Michael Rounds, who is 
writing Miller's biography. "So, like a William Randolph Hearst on a smaller 
scale, he stuffed the inn full of every imaginable thing." 
</P>
<P>
The formula seemed to work. Theodore Roosevelt was the first in a long line of 
former presidents to come for a stay, and Nancy and Ronald Reagan honeymooned 
in one of its suites. Amelia Earhart was among the Mission Inn faithful, and, 
in a series of rooms on the top floor known as Writer's Row, John Steinbeck and 
other authors found inspiration and took up residence. 
</P>
<P>
After Miller's death in 1935, however, the inn began a slow decline. One owner 
auctioned off many of Miller's treasures; another converted a portion of the 
inn to apartments that at one point housed students from UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
By 1976, talk of repossession and demolition prompted the city to purchase the 
property and create a nonprofit group, the Mission Inn Foundation, to operate 
the hotel. The inn continued to decay and lose money, and in 1985, a Wisconsin 
company, Carley Capital Group, purchased it from the city. Soon after, the firm 
closed the inn to undertake an ambitious renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"When it closed it was like you'd lost an old friend," said Judith Whitfield, a 
lifelong Riverside resident who manages an antique store near the inn. "On the 
last day you could have lunch there, some friends and I got together and said 
farewell." 
</P>
<P>
Whitfield and other merchants, however, understood the need for the 
rehabilitation and patiently waited as the jackhammers and drills pried the 
hotel apart for seismic reinforcing and put it back together again. The 
restoration was impressive in its attention to detail, largely thanks to the 
extensive review the project received because of the inn's status as a National 
Historic Landmark. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, just days before the scheduled gala reopening of the Omni 
Mission Inn, a twist of fate befell the old hotel once again. Carley Capital 
collapsed, and Chemical Bank assumed ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, Chemical resumed construction on the inn, pledging to finish 
the project. But the setback left a legacy of bitter disappointment and 
nervousness among other downtown property owners. 
</P>
<P>
George Freeman owns six buildings in central Riverside -- including two across 
the street from the inn. He has drawn up plans to refurbish his properties, one 
of which is vacant, but is reluctant to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
"When Carley failed, the sense of momentum that had been building downtown 
really fizzled," Freeman said. "Until I see what happens with the inn and what 
the city plans to do to create an inviting atmosphere (downtown), I'm not 
prepared to commit to anything." 
</P>
<P>
Gulati acknowledged that the inn's closure has been "frustrating for all of us 
who are anxious to see Riverside improve." But she said progress has been made 
downtown, including the construction of a seven-story office building; the 
opening of the California Museum of Photography and approval of an 84-unit 
condominium, office and retail project adjacent to the inn. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Ron Loveridge agreed, but said the reopening of the inn is 
necessary "symbolically to signal the rebirth of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the inn is open for business, I believe the feeling will be somewhat 
electric in the community," said Loveridge, whose ward includes the city's 
downtown sector. "The hard question, of course, is when will it open?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RIVERSIDE REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>
<P>
The 87-year-old Mission Inn on Seventh Street between Main and Orange in the 
heart of Riverside was supposed to have been the centerpiece of a downtown 
renaissance. But the progress of the redevelopment has been slowed by financial 
problems that have delayed the inn's opening.

LABOR BRIEFING

<TEXT>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: Organized labor has targeted improvements in health care as a top 
national legislative priority in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the current U.S. health care system is not getting the job done and 
we intend to do something about it," said AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland. "Our 
campaign will include national television advertising, mass mailings and every 
other avenue we can use to help focus public attention on the health care 
crisis and to get action from Congress and the Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland acknowledged that the trade union movement "has not come forward with 
a specific proposal for solving this problem." AFL-CIO officials have conducted 
hearings in Chicago, San Francisco, Detroit and other cities in an effort to 
develop policy suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
At one hearing in Louisville, Ky., delegates were told that even though the 
United States leads the world in total health care spending, as many as one in 
three Americans either has inadequate medical insurance or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
REPLACEMENT ISSUE: The future status of "replacement" workers is one of the 
major issues blocking settlement of the violence-marred strike at the New York 
Daily News. But some labor leaders in Washington, arguing that strikers always 
should be guaranteed that they can return to their jobs, cite last month's 
settlement of a Las Vegas casino strike as a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
After striking for nearly 10 months, members of two hotel and restaurant 
employees locals signed a contract with a major casino allowing all strikers to 
return to work with increased wages and benefits, displacing those who had 
taken their jobs during the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement between Culinary Workers Local 226 and Bartenders Local 165 
and Binion's Horseshoe Casino, all strikers were offered their former jobs, 
stations and shifts. Casino owners agreed to rehire the workers as part of a 
settlement of a National Labor Relations Board complaint alleging that they had 
engaged in unfair labor practices. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary-treasurer of Local 226 said that 500 workers have gone back to 
their old jobs, while 74 other union members have chosen to keep new jobs found 
since the strike began last January. 
</P>
<P>
John Wilhelm, an international vice president of the hotel workers union, 
recently told employees: "When the story of the American labor movement's 
recovery from the dark days of the 1980s is written, the first chapter will be 
the heroic victory of the United Mine Workers against the Pittston Coal Co. The 
second chapter will be about you." 
</P>
<P>
CORRUPTION: When it comes to investigating labor corruption, the FBI is the law 
enforcement agency that gets most of the glory. But a lesser-known unit within 
the Labor Department, the Office of Labor Racketeering, continues to toil in 
the vineyard without much credit. 
</P>
<P>
The unit has only 103 field agents but regards itself as "the little engine 
that could." Its chief, Gustave Schick, a former FBI agent, said that his 
employees have more labor experience than FBI agents because they work only 
labor corruption cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Our No. 1 priority currently is rooting out fraud in employee benefit plans, 
schemes that are costing working men and women many thousands of dollars in 
lost benefits and contributions," Schick said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, the unit's investigations have resulted in indictments of 139 
individuals and convictions of 79. ROBERT L. JACKSON

ACTIVISTS STAGE NOISY BUT PEACEFUL PROTEST AT N.Y. CATHEDRAL

About 350 AIDS and abortion-rights activists raised a ruckus across from St. 
Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday while a few sat quietly inside. It was a far cry 
from the pandemonium a year ago that resulted in 113 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 10, 1989, approximately 4,500 protesters gathered to dispute the 
church's teachings. Some were arrested for chanting, lying down and chaining 
themselves to pews during the service. 
</P>
<P>
This time, four people were arrested -- six blocks from the cathedral -- when 
they sat briefly in the street on 5th Avenue, blocking traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Preparing for the anniversary, the Archdiocese of New York got a court order 
Friday to keep protesters from disrupting services. 
</P>
<P>
About 450 police officers were deployed. The church was closed after the Mass 
began. 
</P>
<P>
Some 25 members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT-UP, and Women's 
Health Action and Mobilization, known as WHAM!, walked out of the cathedral 
during Cardinal John J. O'Connor's homily, but services were not disrupted, 
police said.

SERBIAN INCUMBENTS HEADED FOR AN ELECTION VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
YUGOSLAVIA: FORMER COMMUNISTS ALSO APPEAR TO HAVE DONE WELL IN MONTENEGRO.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Riding high on a wave of nationalism, incumbent Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic and other former Communists appeared headed for victory Sunday in 
elections that may have been the last chance to salvage a united Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Counting bogged down as the renamed Socialist Party and opposition leaders 
accused each other of manipulation and voting irregularities. Partial returns 
were still being held back from Yugoslav media more than five hours after the 
polls closed. 
</P>
<P>
But opposition leaders monitoring the returns independently conceded they were 
behind the former Communists in most parliamentary races and that Milosevic was 
far ahead of his rivals for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Official returns are expected today, according to Election Commission chairman 
Caslav Ignjatovic. 
</P>
<P>
Milosevic had to win a majority in the first round, since virtually everyone 
who supported opponents would continue to vote anti-Communist in any runoff. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to us that the Communists will get their 50%," lamented Dragan 
Veselinov, head of the National Peasants Party. 
</P>
<P>
Runoff elections in districts where no candidate receives at least 50% of the 
vote are slated for Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Veselinov said he fears that both the presidency and the 250-seat Serbian 
Assembly will remain under the control of the former Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Vuk Draskovic and his radical nationalist Serbian Renewal Movement had been 
expected to give the Socialists a run for the leadership because support for 
the one-party system that has been in power for 50 years was considered to be 
waning amid economic and political crises. 
</P>
<P>
But Draskovic was trailing badly, Veselinov said, and the 44-year-old 
challenger failed to show up at his party's press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Draskovic earlier Sunday told reporters that he would protest the election 
outcome if party leaders decide the reported voting violations were massive. 
</P>
<P>
While some opposition figures blamed Communist control of the media and 
trickery at the polls for the reportedly uneven result, Veselinov said that the 
anti-Communists had erred in their strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"The nationalists will be very disappointed that the Communists have taken so 
much of the vote on that issue," he said, referring to Serbia's ethnic 
conflicts with Croats and Kosovo Albanians, which are threatening to plunge the 
nation into civil war. 
</P>
<P>
He said the opposition groups would likely join in a coalition to present a 
united front against the Socialists for the scheduled runoffs later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, amid the barrage of opposition accusations that the Socialists 
cheated, Election Commission Chairman Ignjatovic declined to estimate voter 
turnout. Opposition leaders said up to 90% of Serbia's 6.8 million eligible 
voters trekked to the polls in the slushy aftermath of a two-day snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
A Socialist victory would not only buck Eastern Europe's trend of throwing out 
communism when given the chance, but it also could hasten Yugoslavia's collapse 
into rival ethnic pieces. 
</P>
<P>
While Milosevic and Draskovic share the same radical views on restoring Serbian 
control over the rebellious province of Kosovo, the ex-Communists have taken 
the hardest line against two affluent northern republics threatening to secede. 
</P>
<P>
The federal army, controlled by Communist Serbian generals, has warned that it 
would use force to prevent Slovenia and Croatia from pulling out of the 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
Slovenes plan a referendum on secession on Dec. 23, and a Socialist victory in 
Serbia could be expected to fuel that drive for independence. 
</P>
<P>
Elections were also held Sunday in the smallest of Yugoslavia's six republics, 
Montenegro, where the former Communists were expected to easily win reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Recent polls had shown Milosevic with a slight lead over Draskovic, a 
44-year-old writer and ardent nationalist. Even opponents of the 49-year-old 
incumbent predicted he would win because of Serbian resistance to radical 
change and fears that a transition to capitalism advocated by Draskovic would 
raise unemployment, already running more than 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Milosevic enjoys broad backing among fellow Serbs for the very reason other 
nationalities in this multi-ethnic society regard him with suspicion. He has 
restored national pride by reviving a sense of Serbian supremacy after 70 years 
of being regarded as one nation among equals under a united Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Serbs are the largest ethnic group in Yugoslavia and Serbia, with 9.7 million 
residents, is the largest of its six republics.

GULF WATCH: DAY 130; 
</P>
<P>
A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
HOSTAGE FRONT: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S.-chartered Iraqi airliner carrying about 175 Americans touched down early 
today in Frankfurt, Germany, after a flight from Baghdad, the day after a 
smaller group of freed hostages touched down in Texas. Another jet carrying 
about 160 Italians and a sprinkling of hostages of other nationalities arrived 
in Rome, and a British-chartered jet is scheduled to leave today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to 
meet with him by Jan. 3, noting that the Iraqi suggestion of Jan. 12 is only 
three days before the U.N. deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, anticipating a peaceful end to the crisis, said that U.S.-led 
multinational forces would remain in the region during possible negotiations 
later between Baghdad and a restored Kuwaiti government. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also said the United States is working to avoid an international 
conference on the Palestinian issue now because that would imply a linkage with 
the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan's King Hussein proposed a peace plan that calls for 
compromise, for talks among Arabs and for linking other regional problems, such 
as the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
An American soldier became the 53rd serviceman to die during Operation Desert 
Shield when the tractor-trailer truck he was driving overturned during a 
routine water supply mission. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Observer newspaper said Iraq appears to be redrawing the 
Iraqi-Kuwaiti border by putting up a barbed-wire fence around the northern part 
of Kuwait, a sign that Saddam Hussein may be planning a partial withdrawal.

ON HIS DAY OF NOBEL RECOGNITION, SOVIETS SEE GORBACHEV AS AN OPTION; 
</P>
<P>
REFORMS: DOMESTIC ISSUES DEMAND NEARLY ALL HIS ENERGY, AND THEIR SIZE AND

<P>
This was to be President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's day of glory as he received the 
Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of the dramatic way in which his reforms of 
the Soviet Union have changed the world. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of receiving the prize in Oslo and outlining his vision of a 
peaceful new world order in his Nobel address, Gorbachev will be presiding 
today over a meeting of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee on what 
can be done to reverse the country's economic disintegration. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, feeling that his priorities now lie at home, has sent a deputy 
foreign minister to collect the award and promised to deliver his Nobel address 
next spring in the Norwegian capital. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the inevitability of this decision may mark Gorbachev's eclipse on the 
international scene -- not because he will not be in Oslo today, but because he 
must be in Moscow to deal with the Soviet Union's mounting political and 
economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do the domestic crises here demand virtually all of Gorbachev's 
energy, but their sheer size and number diminish his stature internationally. 
</P>
<P>
For the Soviet Union, as for most countries, domestic and foreign policies have 
become interlocked, strength or weakness in one affecting the other, and the 
acute, multiple crises that Gorbachev faces at home seem certain, as a result, 
to have a major international impact. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev cannot be the actor on the international stage that he was a year or 
two ago -- not if he is to work his way through his country's current 
problems," a senior official of the European Community commented during a visit 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"His energies are finite . . . and he must direct them at the most immediate 
need. Moreover, if he is in trouble at home, he will have fewer partners 
abroad." 
</P>
<P>
The boldness with which Gorbachev could maneuver as the leader of a superpower 
has been reduced by his country's need for foreign assistance, even emergency 
deliveries of food to get through the winter. As a prominent Soviet political 
commentator put it this weekend, "It's difficult to be tough in arms 
negotiations when you're begging for food." 
</P>
<P>
With Soviet conservatives grumbling about the "loss" of Eastern Europe and 
weakened defenses, questions also arise about the strength of Gorbachev's 
political support -- will he have backing for further arms reductions, for 
cooperation with Washington to resolve regional conflicts, for developing the 
"new international order" that he seeks for Europe and elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
And that ultimate question of whether he will survive is asked increasingly 
against a much different background. Gorbachev is no longer perceived here as a 
political necessity or as the only option. He could be gone tomorrow, or next 
month, and the grieving here would be short. 
</P>
<P>
Hailing Gorbachev for the achievements since he came to power nearly six years 
ago, Alexander Lyubimov, a commentator on the iconoclastic weekend television 
program Vzglyad, acknowledged that he has brought tremendous changes both to 
the Soviet Union and the world as a whole but that he has lost vital momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"What the president is missing is support -- peace inside the country requires 
the efforts of everybody just as Gorbachev's peace did in the world arena," 
Lyubimov said. "There is no such consensus in our ranks. He is alone." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's predicament stems directly from three intertwined crises that now 
grip the Soviet Union and that affect its international posture: 
</P>
<P>
* The Soviet economy, once the second largest in the world, is disintegrating 
at an ever-faster rate. Its farms produced a good harvest this year, but its 
wholesale and retail networks cannot deliver the food to consumers. Transport 
has broken down across the country, the ruble buys less and less, waiting times 
for some everyday necessities now run into weeks. About half of the consumer 
goods produced now reach buyers through the black market, according to 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet economic system, founded on state ownership of all the means of 
production, central planning and government management, is being dismantled 
faster than the new system -- based on free enterprise and the market forces of 
supply and demand -- can develop as a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
As a whole, the economy has shrunk by nearly 2% this year, according to 
official statistics, and perhaps as much as 10%. Foreign trade is down 12%, 
unemployment is up sharply and inflation has been measured at roughly 80% 
annually when free-market prices are taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
* Most of the country's 15 constituent republics, and parts of them as well, 
are moving rapidly toward some form of independence, putting the continued 
existence of the Soviet Union as a state in question. 
</P>
<P>
Although national self-development is the republics' proclaimed goal, the 
country's economic decline is a powerful motive -- a desire to escape the 
coming collapse. Yet the independence of any, even the Baltic republics of 
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, could pose a major dilemma for the international 
community in terms of the political recognition and economic assistance they 
would need. 
</P>
<P>
For Gorbachev, holding the country together is also vital for any resolution of 
the economic crisis. Because of the interdependence built up through decades of 
central planning, the country is discovering that it either works as an 
economic whole -- or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
* The Soviet Union's new political system, which had been Gorbachev's brightest 
domestic achievement with its glasnost, or openness, and democratization, has 
been unable to cope with the economic crisis and growing nationalism. Instead 
of mobilizing the country's 290 million people, it has led to a quarrelsome 
fragmentation. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, asking for greater powers in an effort to lead the country through 
the crises, has been branded an autocrat and a dictator, although he had given 
up even greater authority when the Communist Party abandoned its monopoly on 
political power. 
</P>
<P>
And conservatives and radicals alike speculate happily on his replacement, 
whether through a military coup d'etat that installs an apparatchik 
administration or through "a coalition of progressive forces." Soviet political 
commentators similarly talk about the emergence of the "post-Gorbachev 
generation" of leaders. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth crisis must be added to these three -- a crisis of confidence, which 
has been growing for the past year and a half and which seems to sap the Soviet 
will to pursue the hard course of political and economic reform that the nation 
chose under Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"Of everything we have gone through, the present food shortage is the most 
soul-destroying -- standing in line for an hour and a half and not knowing 
whether there will be anything at the end to feed your family," a chemical 
engineer and political activist, Natalya Rubin, remarked over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only natural to blame Gorbachev -- he's in power, isn't he? -- everybody 
says that if he had been paying attention to what was going on at home instead 
of visiting Rome and Paris and Washington and New York and New Delhi and London 
and Havana, things would not have gone so badly wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, these domestic crises have had only a limited impact on foreign 
policy, according to both diplomats and Soviet political analysts, but that 
appears to be changing with the accelerating disintegration of the Soviet 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The economy has become key, if it was not before," a senior political 
commentator, normally a Gorbachev supporter, said over the weekend. "We cannot 
pose as a superpower while we are worried about feeding our cities this winter. 
We cannot venture forth as the Soviet Union when half our republics are 
declaring independence because they do not want to go down with us. And we 
cannot do deals while we are politically divided over where we are headed."

The city's private sanitation workers Sunday began a strike that threatened to 
bury the city's already littered sidewalks under mounds of uncollected garbage. 
</P>
<P>
The collectors, who pick up 40% of the city's trash, walked out after rejecting 
a new contract. The strike affects about 250,000 city businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Adelstein, recording secretary for Teamsters Local 813, which represents 
about 2,000 haulers, said owners had offered a three-year contract with a total 
weekly pay increase of $70, beginning with a $10 raise on June 1. The union 
sought a total hike of $95. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses scurried to find alternative ways to handle their garbage, urging 
tenants to cut down on paper use and "double bag" perishable rubbish.

TENURE FIGHT FOR THEOLOGIAN IS DEFUSED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A confrontation between Auburn University's faculty and its administration was 
apparently averted with a ruling last week that university policies were not 
violated by the withdrawal of an offer of tenure to controversial Catholic 
scholar Charles Curran. 
</P>
<P>
University officials announced that the Alabama school's Tenure and Promotions 
Committee decided that university President James E. Martin did not violate 
campus policies or Curran's academic freedom when he denied tenure to the 
scholar. 
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal last spring of the offer angered some faculty members, who felt 
Curran -- barred by the Vatican in 1986 from teaching Catholic theology -- was 
again being unfairly treated. 
</P>
<P>
Enticed to Auburn by the prospect of tenure, Curran eventually had to settle 
for a one-year, visiting professorship at the university. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn's University Senate had set a deadline of last Friday for Martin to 
offer a full explanation of his reasons for denying tenure. 
</P>
<P>
After Martin met with the tenure committee, Ronald J. Henry, vice president for 
academic affairs, announced that a majority of members agreed that the 
university president acted properly. 
</P>
<P>
Campus policies state that when a currently employed professor is denied 
tenure, the reason must be disclosed in writing. However, because Curran was 
not an employee at the time of the offer, those rules do not apply to his case, 
Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the tenure committee said Martin assured members that his 
reservations about Curran "had nothing to do with moral turpitude, ethical 
reputation or scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Neither the 13-member committee nor Martin fully disclosed the president's 
objections to granting Curran tenure, but they were thought by some faculty 
members to be primarily related to Curran's disputes with Catholic authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Mary P. Richards of Auburn's College of Liberal Arts noted that in her 
written offer of tenure to Curran, dated April 4, she said it was contingent 
upon approval by the president. 
</P>
<P>
However, Curran has said that his understanding was that tenure had already 
been approved when it was offered.

Gary Kasparov regained the lead in his world title chess defense against 
challenger Anatoly Karpov with a brisk victory in the second session of their 
adjourned 18th game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov needed only seven minutes of thought to knock off 16 moves and wrap up 
what experts had regarded as a certain victory. 
</P>
<P>
The win gives Kasparov a lead of 9 1/2 to 8 1/2 with three wins, two losses and 
13 draws. 
</P>
<P>
He needs only a 12-12 tie to keep his title of champion -- the result of his 
last encounter with Karpov, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Many experts felt that Karpov had gained a slight psychological advantage with 
his win in Game 17 but now reckon that time is running out for the challenger. 
</P>
<P>
The match is to resume today. Here are the moves of Game 18:

<TEXT>
<P>
Wheelchair-bound since 1928 because of polio, Helynn Hoffa has accumulated a 
lifetime's worth of practical tips on overcoming handicaps, including a 
childhood pep talk from President Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with Oxnard College instructor Gary Morgan, the 70-year-old La 
Jolla woman has written a self-help book for the disabled covering everything 
from dating and independent living to education, careers and world travel. 
</P>
<P>
Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop commended the 309-page trade paperback, 
"Yes You Can," for offering "extraordinary help for disabled people and those 
who care for them." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffa, who met Roosevelt at age 12 while undergoing therapy in Warm Springs, 
Ga., said he asked her what she wanted to be. "I shrugged and told him I wasn't 
sure I could be anything." 
</P>
<P>
She said he told her: "Just remember this, if I can be in a wheelchair and be 
president of the greatest country in the world, you can do or be whatever you 
want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffa, a onetime sportswriter, radio personality and art teacher, said she 
wrote the book with Morgan "to save other people the years I wasted while I 
floundered around not knowing how to work toward a goal." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 36 million Americans suffer some form of disability, said Morgan, 47, an 
English and journalism instructor. He said many can benefit from such simple 
devices as an easy-to-grasp ball that arthritis victims can use to hold a pen 
for writing. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, who has also written three books on Colorado railroads and a volume of 
poetry, said he wrote the chapters in "Yes You Can" on employment, computers 
and legal rights and also compiled the appendix of addresses and phone numbers 
for assistance organizations, clubs and foundations. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffa wrote the motivational chapters and practical tips, such as how to choose 
a personal care attendant and suitable housing arrangements. She said disabled 
people should not resign themselves to being crippled but should take advantage 
of every opportunity presented and every hand extended. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone of us has a Mt. Everest in our lives," Hoffa said. "We all need a 
band of Sherpa guides to get there. No one stands atop Everest alone."

Raising babies can be stressful. Consider the adult Western gull. When chicks 
want to eat they peck at a red mark on one of their parents' bills until mom or 
dad regurgitates a meal. 
</P>
<P>
"It is kind of fun to go out to Anacapa Island and watch them do that," said 
Jean Van Tatenhove, a ranger for Channel Islands National Park. "It's a little 
gross, but it's fun too." 
</P>
<P>
For the adult Xantus Murrelet, chick-rearing includes forcing the young birds 
to tumble down cliffs on Santa Barbara Island for a life at sea two days after 
they hatch. 
</P>
<P>
Calling sea birds the last frontier for bird watchers, Van Tatenhove, an 
ornithologist, told the stories of some of the area's lesser known sea birds at 
park headquarters at Ventura Harbor on Sunday. Each month the National Park 
Service features free lectures on park wildlife. Talks on sea birds will 
continue through December. In January, rangers will begin discussions on whales 
to mark the mammals' migration through the Santa Barbara Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Van Tatenhove displayed five of the 11 birds monitored by rangers, including 
the endangered brown pelican. 
</P>
<P>
West Anacapa Island serves as the largest breeding colony in the United States 
for California brown pelicans. Centuries ago Chumash Indians made coats from 
the pelicans' finely marked feathers, she said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

100 RESERVISTS LEAVE FOR FT. ORD HOSPITAL DUTY

A unit of 100 Army medical reservists departed from Ventura early Sunday 
morning bound for noncombat duty at an Army hospital in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the 6252nd U.S. Army Hospital, headquartered in Ventura, left for 
the Silas B. Hayes Army Hospital at Ft. Ord to replace active-duty medical 
personnel reassigned to Saudi Arabia. Members of the 6252nd reserve unit 
include physicians, nurses and medical technicians. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Stephen Bisset, deputy commanding general of the 63rd Army Reserve 
Command, said Silas B. Hayes Army Hospital treats active-duty personnel, their 
families and retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Although some may be transferred later to Army hospitals elsewhere in the 
country, the reservists are not scheduled to leave the United States to join 
Operation Desert Shield, the buildup of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
But Bisset said their role as reservists grows in importance as more troops are 
deployed to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you have a unit supporting Desert Shield stateside or supporting the 
operation itself, it doesn't make a difference," he said. "They're all 
performing a function that the Army needs." About a fifth of the reservists 
under his command, or about 2,000 soldiers, have been activated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Women make up about a third of the reservists who left spouses and children 
behind early Sunday morning. Although they will not see combat, it was no 
consolation for some family members left behind, including husbands and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
All had risen early in the predawn hours to wave goodby to the reservists. Some 
wept as the citizen-soldiers boarded buses bound for Ft. Ord. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Ruth Brunick, 42, of Simi Valley said she remembered when her husband 
Robert left for Vietnam more than 20 years ago. But on Sunday, the roles were 
reversed as the nurse, dressed in fatigues, said goodby to her 44-year-old 
husband and 21-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's harder to stay behind. It's easier to go," Robert Brunick said. 
"You go through all the feelings of worry, but it's something you have to deal 
with." PSYCHE PASCUAL

100 PROTEST U.S. ROLE IN MIDDLE EAST

About 100 anti-war demonstrators, from grandmothers to teen-agers facing the 
draft, chanted and sang Vietnam-era protest songs at Libbey Park in Ojai on 
Sunday to denounce U.S. military involvement in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai activists, many wearing peace signs, urged those gathered at Libbey Park 
to write letters to political leaders in opposition to war before tensions 
escalate higher in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
In the first organized protest in Ojai against U.S. intervention in the Middle 
East, demonstrators carried homemade signs demanding that President Bush "Bring 
the Troops Home Now" and urging "No Blood for Oil." 
</P>
<P>
Margot Eiser, a mother clad in a T-shirt proclaiming her as an Ojai Peace 
Child, said she would go to jail before allowing her son to enlist in the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's rally, organized by area church groups and the Ventura County 
Coalition for Peace in the Persian Gulf, is a sign of the growing opposition in 
Ventura County to U.S. deployment of troops in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 protesters marched near the Buenaventura Mall on Saturday, and last 
week protesters were spat upon as they paraded through a street fair in 
Ventura. Another protest is scheduled for Sunday at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
The age of the protesters in Ojai spanned more than 60 years. Ave Wolfman, 77, 
said she attended the rally because she learned about the horrors of war as an 
Army nurse in France during World War II. "I want to bring the boys and the 
women home for Christmas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Phelps, 17, said he decided to protest a possible war for fear of being 
called to fight. Phelps said he dreads receiving a notice from the Selective 
Service when he turns 18 in May. "It's scary that this might be going on for a 
while," Phelps said. PSYCHE PASCUAL

A joint Moorpark City Council and Planning Commission workshop on future 
development in the city has been rescheduled for Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop, one in a series of meetings on the city's General Plan update, 
was originally scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Wozniak said the meeting date was changed to allow new 
commission appointees Michael Wesner and John Torres more time to study all of 
the planning material that would be included in the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which will also include discussion on transportation issues, is 
now scheduled for Monday, Jan. 14, in the Community Center. The public is 
invited to attend. 
</P>
<P>
A General Plan serves as the blueprint for all future development in a city. 
The plan also addresses transportation improvements that may be required by 
future development. CARLOS V. LOZANO

SAN DIEGO MARATHON: MARTINEZ, SMITH, RELATIVELY NEW TO LONG-DISTANCE RUNNING, 
CHRISTEN A NEW COURSE WITH VICTORIES.

<P>
Their common ground pretty much ended when the miles of asphalt to the finish 
line did. 
</P>
<P>
By the time most people were starting their first cup of coffee Sunday morning, 
Benjamin Paredez Martinez of Ecatepec, Mexico, and Kathy Smith of Newport Beach 
were crowned winners in the San Diego Marathon at the Oceanside pier, efforts 
than earned them $2,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The runs set records on the new North County course, but the times, even helped 
by warm breezes and clear, 74-degree conditions, were hardly blistering. 
Martinez, 29, finished in 2 hours 19 minutes 3 seconds, 36 seconds faster than 
Doug Kurtis of Northville, Mich. Smith's 2:43:05 seemed days quicker than the 
2:52:12 posted by Escondido's Mindy Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
In years past, the marathon's mystery often has been who the leader was, not 
how he got there. Runners, often from Mexico, would register late, and race 
officials were at their wits end when the media screamed to know the identity 
of the leader. 
</P>
<P>
This year, officials made sure there were no mystery men out on the course. 
They knew who Martinez was, but no one was sure how he was able to practically 
appear out of nowhere to take the lead from Alfredo Rosas of San Pedro going 
into the 25-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
What Martinez did, was start out slow and deliberate. Through an interpreter, 
Martinez said he started out running 5:15 or 5:20 miles. Rosas and a pack of as 
many as eight came out at a pace seven to 10 seconds quicker per mile. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it would kill them, that they would never keep it up," said Martinez, 
who won with a 5:18-mile pace. "I had to have patience and run from the back." 
</P>
<P>
After the 14-mile mark, the pack has already thinned to just Rosas, Danny 
Bustos, Doug Kurtis and Ernesto Gutierrez, who ran single file for a time. 
Martinez and Martin Rodriguez Rivera held back, but Martinez soon heard a 
little voice that told him to move or be removed from contention. 
</P>
<P>
"The first 10-15 miles, I could have been in 1,000th place," Martinez said. "I 
didn't care. Then I got worried." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez left Rivera, and started on the chase. Since Martinez hadn't been seen 
earlier, it originally was thought the figure gainly ground slowly but 
methodically from Mile 21 to Mile 24 was San Diego's Henry Chio. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. Martinez' late kick caught Rosas, who had broken away on his own for a 
three-mile lead at Mile 21, cramped and been surprised at the 23-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I tied up, there was nothing I could do," said Rosas, who was third in 
2:19.49. "As he started closing, that's when my legs really started getting 
sore. I tried to just hang on, to hang in there, but he shot ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
Before Martinez took the lead for good -- a uphill surge at Mile 25 -- it 
appeared Rosas was hearing footsteps and was looking over his shoulder to see 
who was gaining on him. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, said Rosas. "The police on the bikes were telling me how close he was," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second marathon in two weeks that Kurtis, 38, has run, and almost 
won. The Bangkok Marathon in November was his 13th of the year, his 112th to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
The only recurring theme in Martinez' and Smith's backgrounds -- other than the 
26.2 miles they ran -- was that they are novices at long-distance running, this 
was their first victory at this distance and that they are both teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez is a world-class biathlete who finished third at the World Duathlon 
Championship two weeks ago near Palm Springs. He has run only two marathons 
before Sunday. He teaches physical education in his hometown, 10-15 miles 
outside of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 24, was a 5,000- and 10,000-meter specialist at Stanford but is now 
focusing on longer distances. She is a fourth- through sixth-grade teacher at 
College Park in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
She was holding class with reporters long before Ireland, 39, was carried into 
a room for mandatory drug testing -- the United States Olympic Committee Drug 
Testing Program randomly selected this race to administer tests to the top 
finishers. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to come out here, be as low-key as possible and try to qualify for 
the trials," said Smith, who finished fourth last year and ran a personal-best 
time Sunday. She met and beat the Olympic Trials qualifying standard of 2:45. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said she and Ireland ran together -- they even chatted -- through the 
20-mile mark, until Smith got her feet working faster than her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Having run with Ireland last year in the San Diego Marathon, Smith knew a 
little of Ireland's racing style. 
</P>
<P>
"She's really tough in the latter part of a race," Smith said. "I wanted to 
hang back with her, so then she could carry me through the latter part. She 
hung in pretty well with me." 
</P>
<P>
Smith earlier this year ran the Long Beach Marathon, where she finished seventh 
but has been concentrating on this distance for just a year. She is getting 
smarter about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I led from Miles 13 to 22," Smith said. "This year's it's just a 
matter of maturity. And the hills were positive for me." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said entered this event because he knew the field was weak and his 
chances were good. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Rosas and Kurtis were good, but it was a relatively weak field," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But weak field or not, the 4,000-plus runners who participated in the event 
seemed to relish the experience, as all the problems the marathon has had to 
deal with faded as each runner crossed the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful course, and this was a great marathon," one runner told race 
director Lynn Flanagan. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it went off so well," said another to a volunteer. "You'd 
never know anything had happened that was at all an inconvenience." 
</P>
<P>
DeAnna Sodoma of Escondido won her first marathon wheelchair race in 2:17:52; 
Saul Mendoza Hernandez of Mexico won the men's division in 1:57:50. 
</P>
<P>
James Sheremeta of San Diego won the men's half marathon in 1:08:59; Jeanne 
Lassee-Johnson was the women's half winner in 1:16:15.

EVIDENCE OF RACIAL TENSION MOUNTS AS O.C. URBANIZES; 
</P>
<P>
HATE: RACIST DIATRIBES, SKINHEAD ATTACKS AND VANDALISM DIRECTED AT MINORITIES 
RAISE FEARS FOR FUTURE.

Tustin High School students had gathered in the gymnasium to watch an "air 
guitar" competition between a black group performing Janet Jackson's Rhythm 
Nation and a white group lip-synching the Rolling Stone's "Start Up," when 
things turned ugly. 
</P>
<P>
After an announcement that the Rolling Stone routine had won first place, 
groups of blacks and whites seated in the bleachers suddenly began calling each 
other "honkies" and "niggers." 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe what was happening," Rose Silguero, 16, a junior said after 
the confrontation. "I was so panicky my hands were shaking. I wanted to cry. I 
thought, 'Oh, my God, why does this have to happen here?' " 
</P>
<P>
The incident last March offers evidence of what some say is a disturbing trend 
in Orange County: that as this onetime outpost of white suburbia becomes 
increasingly urbanized and ethnically diverse, racial tensions are increasing. 
</P>
<P>
There have been reports of skinhead attacks in Huntington Beach, of racist 
literature distributed on high school campuses and at shopping centers in 
Fullerton, and of mud and paint splashed on Little Saigon freeway signs. And 
recently, a black family in Laguna Hills returned home and found their house 
vandalized, its walls spray painted with racial slurs. 
</P>
<P>
While there are no Orange County statistics on hate crimes, the rash of recent 
incidents comes at a time when hate crimes are on the rise nationally and in 
Los Angeles County, where they jumped 32% in the first half of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission, said the county is at an important crossroads: It must either 
accept a destiny as a cosmopolitan area with a harmonious blend of cultures, or 
cling to the parochialism of the past, paving the way for future racial 
discord. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Right-wing groups that spew a lot of bigotry are all that some people 
know about Orange County," said Kennedy, who runs the county-funded commission 
formed to promote racial understanding. "This is a time for us to change that 
perception." 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills incident was roundly condemned by community leaders, including 
Sheriff Brad Gates. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the most despicable individuals that I can think about," Gates said. 
"Anybody that can steal about in someone's home and terrorize a family should 
be handled accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "We had several incidents in the last month or so. It's pretty hard 
to gauge whether (hate crimes) are on the rise. But obviously any responsible 
person would not like to see this continue in our community." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to speaking out after the Laguna Hills incident, Gates also 
recently sent a memorandum to his deputies urging them to be alert to possible 
hate crimes and sensitive in their handling of such cases. 
</P>
<P>
Some community activists say that relations among the county's multitude of 
racial and ethnic groups are tenuous at best and likely to deteriorate if 
economic conditions worsen. 
</P>
<P>
"I think at this point the economy has been viable enough to keep potential 
tensions under wraps," said William Billingsley, a UC Irvine doctoral candidate 
studying race relations. "But if there are serious economic difficulties in the 
future, this could be a potentially explosive situation." 
</P>
<P>
Only recently, with the unprecedented infusion of minorities, has Orange County 
begun to grapple with the complex social and economic conflicts inherent in a 
multiethnic society. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the county evolved as a homogeneous, bedroom community for whites 
fleeing urban crime, pollution and other ills that some attributed to 
increasing numbers of blacks, Latinos and Asians moving into Los Angeles. A Ku 
Klux Klan stronghold in the 1920s and later a place where the John Birch 
Society was active, Orange County earned a reputation as a national symbol of 
unbridled conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Orozco, the first Latino appointed as an Orange County Municipal judge, 
based in Santa Ana, remembers his initial impression of the county when he took 
office in 1976: "lily white." 
</P>
<P>
"You'd go to a restaurant or to the movies and it was white," said Orozco, who 
was raised in Los Angeles. "I went to a Mexican restaurant in Laguna Niguel and 
I was the only Hispanic in there except for the waiters." 
</P>
<P>
But all that is changing. 
</P>
<P>
For, just as Los Angeles became increasingly Latino in the 1960s, Orange County 
is undergoing a similar metamorphosis today. With a gross product about the 
same as the entire nation of Argentina, the county has become a magnet for 
minorities attracted by a wealth of economic opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic changes seem to be occurring in the northern Orange County. 
Because of lower housing costs and proximity to Los Angeles, Koreans, 
Vietnamese, Mexicans and other immigrants are forever changing the complexion 
of middle- and working-class white neighborhoods in Fullerton, Garden Grove and 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, more affluent non-white families are forging farther south into 
planned communities such as Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel, challenging Orange 
County's reputation as the land of suburban white flight. 
</P>
<P>
"What is so astonishing about this current transformation is that it has 
occurred almost overnight," said County of Orange demographer William Gayk. "If 
the trend continues, we will have something similar to what's occurred in L.A. 
County." 
</P>
<P>
Consider, he said, that 20 years ago 90% of Orange County residents were white; 
in 1990, that number dropped to 75% of 2.2 million people. And according to 
current projections, one in three residents will be Latino or Asian by the year 
2000. Blacks will account for another 2% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
A better barometer of the county's future is the public schools. In 1970, 
whites made up 86% of students in grades kindergarten through 12. This school 
year, 44% are Latino, Asian or black. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, only a few schools have any white students left, said Khamchong 
Luangpraseut, director of the Indochinese program for Santa Ana Unified, the 
county's largest school district. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has no central clearinghouse that keeps track of racially 
motivated crimes. They can be reported to local law enforcement agencies, the 
FBI or the Human Relations Commission, among other agencies. Often they go 
unreported because the victims fear further repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
However, a number of racially motivated incidents have drawn attention in 
recent months: 
</P>
<P>
* Late last month, in Orange, a newlywed couple -- the wife is Jewish and her 
husband Catholic -- found that their car had been vandalized, its dashboard 
marked with a swastika and an anti-Semitic death message scrawled in the dust 
on its side. The couple reported a similar incident earlier this year: Someone 
drew a swastika in the dust of the husband's windshield. Orange police said 
they were investigating the incident as possible religious terrorism. The 
couple has since moved. 
</P>
<P>
* Twice in the last three weeks, rock-wielding vandals shattered a glass door 
at the front of the Anaheim Korean Presbyterian Church in attacks that Anaheim 
police said appeared to be hate crimes. In the first incident on Nov. 13, 
messages including "get out now" were written in chalk on a church sidewalk and 
an office blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
* In August, a 15-year-old Garden Grove girl was disfigured in a brawl between 
two groups of young people. Amber Jefferson, the daughter of a white mother and 
black father, initially told authorities that she had been attacked because she 
was black. The district attorney rejected her claims, saying that the incident 
was sparked by a confrontation between two girls over a boy. Still, for a time 
the incident became a cause celebre for civil rights activists and helped to 
focus attention on racial tensions in the county. 
</P>
<P>
* In June, three young whites described as skinheads attacked a 26-year-old 
black man in the back parking lot of a Huntington Beach shopping center. The 
victim told police his assailants were working on a car when one of them yelled 
a racial slur at him. When he yelled back, they began beating and kicking him. 
He said he managed to run away after one of the men threatened him with a 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
* In January, a white supremacist from Anaheim was arrested after allegedly 
walking into a Fullerton pizza restaurant and threatening to kill a Jewish 
cook. Martin Dayton Cox, 23, an ex-convict who was once bodily thrown off the 
"Oprah Winfrey Show," also listed the cook's name and place of employment on a 
white-supremacy group's recorded message line that urges callers to hate Jews, 
blacks and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
* And in November, the Laguna Hills home of Delano De Silva was vandalized, its 
walls and furniture painted with racial slurs. De Silva, an insurance 
underwriter, was born in Panama but is now a U.S. citizen and Air Force 
veteran. It was his 14-year-old son, a student at Laguna Hills High School, who 
returned home and found the house vandalized. Sheriff's investigators called 
the incident a "classic hate crime" and speculated that it was committed by 
youths, possibly members of a skinhead gang. 
</P>
<P>
Officials such as Kennedy of the Human Relations Commission say incidents such 
as the one in Laguna Hills provide evidence that as Orange County becomes more 
ethnically diverse, it must change. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the County of Orange more than any other area has a challenge to 
change," said Korean American Assn. President Ho Young Chung, a 56-year-old 
insurance agent from Westminster. Whites "have no choice but to accept that 
challenge and find a harmonious way to live together." 
</P>
<P>
Many whites, however, apparently do not believe that racism is a major problem. 
A Times poll last year found that whites ranked prejudice lowest on a list of 
concerns including crime, drugs, unemployment, moral decline, the economy, the 
budget deficit, AIDS and foreign trade. Ironically, the same poll found that 
blacks believe they encounter more discrimination in Orange County than 
anywhere else in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"A significant part of the problem in Orange County," said Kennedy, "is that 
people do not acknowledge that racism is a problem. Everyone says, 'some 
skinheads jumped a Vietnamese after school. It's just an isolated incident.' " 
</P>
<P>
Demographic experts say these kinds of conflicts are inevitable when the old 
order gives way to a more culturally diverse county. But how can a community 
defuse racial tensions before they escalate? 
</P>
<P>
Latino rights activist Amin David is focusing his attention on the schools. 
David, president of Los Amigos, a Latino activist group, is among a growing 
number of community leaders and scholars lobbying for ethnic studies classes as 
a required part the college curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"I envision something that would embody the histories of the dominant 
minorities and their contributions to our society," David said. "Something to 
give the Anglo a small handle on us." 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic awareness programs are already under way at a handful of county schools. 
At La Quinta, a public high school in Westminster, Youth Leadership for Action, 
a group of three white and four Asian students concerned about an increase in 
racial incidents, is working to fight prejudice by sponsoring regular cultural 
activities for their fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
The demographic changes at La Quinta are typical of what has occurred at many 
public schools in the county: 10 years ago, 71% of the students were white. 
Today 42% are white, 32.2% are Latino and 24.7% are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
The troubling results, some students say, are self-imposed segregatation in 
lunchrooms, racially motivated gang violence and mutual distrust of other 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that unless there are programs initiated either in the school or 
community that will make people aware that things are changing and diversity 
isn't always bad, there are going to be problems," said Qui Nguyen, 18, 
president of Youth Leadership for Action's ethnic awareness council. "We've got 
to do something to get that message out."

TROUBLE? Nippon Shinpan, the Japanese firm that has taken over the development 
of 232 prime acres in Dana Point from an Australian company, has been wining 
and dining local residents. . . . But its Australian liaison has yet to show 
the plans to city staffers, thus displeasing City Manager William O. Talley. 
"This may work well in the outback," Talley fumed. "You can't scratch out a 
project on the back of a barroom napkin and submit it." Jan Herman and Ralph

PLAN AHEAD: Speaking of arts grants (above), Security Pacific Bank paid $25,000 
this year to be honorary producer of South Coast Rep's "A Christmas Carol," but 
when the programs came out, oops, the usual credit was missing. . . . Smoothing 
this over fell to SCR receptionist Holly Van Holt and her volunteers, who are 
applying 10,000 gold stickers to programs to credit the bank. "I'm only on the 
thousandth sticker," she said. "I'm not even close."

STREET SMART: THE ONLY THING FILLING THIS TRAFFIC GAP IS AGGRAVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Something that aggravates me is drivers who leave a large space between their 
car and the one ahead when stopped for a signal or other delay. 
</P>
<P>
It frequently causes one or more cars to stick out into a through lane, or 
prevents cars from reaching a left-turn lane, or causes other inconvenience. I 
have seen some accidents that could have been prevented by closing up. I think 
it is plain inconsiderate. 
</P>
<P>
Robert G. Lyon, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
Yes, a vintage pet peeve. I, too, loath people who don't "close up," as you 
call it. I've seen some folks lag so far behind the guy in front that one could 
drive an M-1 tank through the gap. 
</P>
<P>
Usually it's no big deal, just another little nuisance that causes your blood 
pressure to soar. But if enough people in a long queue of cars do that, it can 
potentially make those to the rear miss a green light, and there is no greater 
pain in the car-crazy culture of Southern California than having to sit through 
the indignity of two go-rounds at a traffic signal. 
</P>
<P>
I, unfortunately, suffer from a far different driving illness. I tend to close 
up so tightly to the motorist in front that a well-trained squirrel could do 
the lambada from one bumper to another. Sometimes I roll so close the squirrel 
would be squashed. Now that's a pet peeve. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I am driving along Coast Highway in Laguna Beach. The traffic is moving at 45 
m.p.h. There are cars ahead of me, and beside me. The guy behind me is flashing 
his headlights at me. I can see him in my rear-view mirror. He is so angry and 
frustrated, changing lanes back and forth! What is the problem? Is only his 
time valuable? We should all pull over and let him have the highway? 
</P>
<P>
I'm traveling along at 70 m.p.h. (is the speed limit still 55 m.p.h.?) The 
person behind me is frantically flashing his headlights at me! Now what does he 
want me to do? Drive on the ice plant? Gee whiz, what is wrong with Orange 
County drivers? They seem to become selfish, self-centered, discourteous people 
hiding behind a machine. I can't imagine the same person behaving this way in a 
bank or grocery line. The truth of their personality comes out behind the 
wheel, all their selfishness and greed. 
</P>
<P>
Also I'm sure you have experienced trying to change lanes, your blinker has 
been on for five minutes, and people speed up, not letting you pass at all. 
Another issue we'll talk about in our book about selfishness and greed on the 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Sprenger, Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
Yes, some of us do become jerks when we get behind the wheel. And we all know 
who we are. 
</P>
<P>
Suffice to say, slipping into a bucket seat seems to transform the average Jane 
or Joe. People who are the most meek of friends or neighbors become raving 
lunatics once safely shrouded behind their tinted windows and encased in 3,000 
pounds of sheet metal and plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Erratic driving behavior is the least of your worries. A UC Irvine study found 
that nearly 27% of 480 drivers surveyed knew someone who carried a gun in the 
car. Among men, 17% admitted throwing an object at another car, nearly 11% said 
they had bumped or rammed another car in anger and one-third of them said they 
had chased another car. 
</P>
<P>
A prime reason, experts suggest, is the anonymity afforded by the automobile. 
It allows the most level-headed of us to let loose of standard social 
inhibitions and act out impulsively, switching lanes recklessly, flashing our 
headlights at the car ahead or worse. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem in traffic-clogged Southern California, of course, is the 
strain that the daily gridlock puts on our psyches. Our go-go lifestyle of 
dashing out to do lunch and then rushing off after work for racquetball is 
locked on a collision course with the nerve-shattering congestion that 
invariably blocks our paths. 
</P>
<P>
I have a ready remedy when some creature approaches from the rear flashing his 
lights to get by. Pull over and let him or her through. It's just not worth it. 
And let's all of us take care to keep from being that lunatic racing to reach 
our destination at the expense of others. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Just a few lines about my feelings on traffic in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
* I question the value of some of the turn lights. Many times traffic on the 
main streets is tied up to allow only one or two cars to turn. 
</P>
<P>
* Several times your readers have suggested roundabouts, a la Europe. The 
difference is the European attitude of every man for himself. The traffic 
really moves. Witness the circle in Orange. The signs say yield, but the cars 
almost stop. 
</P>
<P>
* In Europe, the fast lane is indeed the fast lane. Here we have the people who 
tie up traffic for miles and then flip you off when you honk or flash your 
lights at them. What's wrong with moving over one lane when someone is behind 
you. 
</P>
<P>
* And last but certainly not least, why do we still have those long funeral 
processions complete with rent-a-cops and flashing lights. Why just funerals, 
why not baptisms, weddings, etc. I live in east Orange and almost every day I 
can't enter or exit Santiago Boulevard because of a 40- to 50-car procession. I 
think they have long outlived their usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you for letting me sound off. I feel better already. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hardman, Orange 
</P>
<P>
Were you driving down Coast Highway in Laguna Beach recently? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it's irritating when someone clogs the fast lane. Certainly, however, 
it's not worth getting riled up about. And honking at drivers to get them to 
change lanes is a poor practice. The auto horn, any traffic expert will tell 
you, is meant as a warning device in the case of emergency, not to willy-nilly 
clear a path in front of you. 
</P>
<P>
But I can certainly sympathize with your feelings about traffic signals. I've 
met few I've liked. Traffic officials in Orange County say the passage of 
Measure M, the half-cent sales tax increase to provide $3 billion over the next 
two decades for transportation improvements, should send a torrent of dollars 
to help ease such signal problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange traffic circle is perhaps my favorite place in the county. It is not 
only beautiful, but the ultimate driving experience (sorry BMW). As you note, 
one never knows when Aunt Sallie is going to slam on the brakes as she rolls 
into the circle. 
</P>
<P>
We touched on funeral rent-a-cops a few Monday's ago. I imagine they're here to 
stay, along with the practice of allowing mourners to drive in a long 
procession of cars. The way I look at it, the poor guy or gal who takes that 
procession lying down deserves a little respect. Let them have their day to tie 
up traffic.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;

<P>
MAYOR VOWS TO BOOST TRADE, BATTLE GANGS

<P>
Declaring that the theme for his year in office will be "La Habrans taking 
charge of our future," newly elected Mayor John C. Holmberg presented a list of 
goals -- highlighted by a call to spark commerce -- to the City Council at its 
last meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 15 items outlined by Holmberg was a program called "Shop La Habra," 
along with a plan to establish council recognition of outstanding businesses in 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime advocate of efforts to combat gangs, Holmberg proposed a closer 
relationship with juvenile court judges in developing community programs for 
at-risk youths. He also urged development of a youth program called Leadership 
La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to identify the best young people in town and encourage them to stay 
in La Habra after they finish school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Promising to maintain weekly office hours at City Hall, Holmberg said he will 
encourage residents to get involved through periodic "Meet the Mayor" sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Holmberg also urged implementation of an employee suggestion system with 
rewards for money-saving ideas or ways to cut red tape. 
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to continue efforts for city beautification, and to complete a 
program to expand the Police Department during his term in office. 
</P>
<P>
"Our city should turn opportunity into action and take charge of our future," 
said Holmberg, who will be serving his third one-year term as mayor. His 
previous terms were in 1984-85 and 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
Following the selection of Holmberg as mayor, the council appointed James Flora 
as mayor pro tem. William D. Mahoney will chair the city's Redevelopment 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The newest member of the La Habra City Council is David Cheverton, who received 
the most votes in the November election. He previously served on the Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Cheverton was named vice-chairman of the city Redevelopment Agency and will 
chair La Habra's Civic Improvement Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing mayor Beth Graham was honored by her fellow council members and by 
County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez for her year of service as mayor. Graham 
remains a member of the city council. DAVID F. BURKE

LATINOS ARE TARGETED IN DONOR HUNT

"Ayuden a Armando." 
</P>
<P>
Not far from the hand-lettered sign asking for help, a thin boy watched 
solemnly as workers from the Life-Savers Foundation of America recruited 
potential bone marrow donors who might save his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I am grateful to the people for coming," 12-year-old Armando Garcia said 
quietly as shoppers from the busy VivaMart store put down their groceries a 
moment to sit at folding tables, bare their arms and contribute a small vial of 
blood for testing. 
</P>
<P>
"If this can help him," said Jose Garcia, Armando's father, "it is something 
really big. It means a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Armando, a pale youth whose deep, dark bangs frame wide, brown eyes, has been 
ill for more than a year with mylodysplastic syndrome, a form of leukemia. 
Without a bone marrow transplant, he is not expected to live more than six 
months, foundation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But hoping to help him survive, the Covina-based nonprofit foundation was 
launching its first campaign targeting the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Explained foundation spokeswoman Susan Rafkin: "The chances that two unrelated 
people will match are one in 20,000. . . . But we're hoping it might be easier 
to find a match for Armando among Hispanic people." 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old organization runs a national registry of 100,000 potential 
donors, but Latinos are seriously under-represented, Rafkin said. Other 
foundation workers said they do not believe that the Latino community 
understands the grave need for bone marrow donors. 
</P>
<P>
In their effort to find a match for Armando, foundation officials placed ads 
and news stories about the boy's plight in Latino newspapers and on 
Latino-radio stations, Rafkin said. They printed new leaflets in Spanish 
explaining Life-Savers and the need for a bone marrow transplant ("un 
transplante de medula osea"). 
</P>
<P>
They set up a toll-free "Armando hot line" (1 (800) 950-1050) to handle 
contributions for testing potential donors. 
</P>
<P>
And they persuaded the Santa Ana Business Bureau to donate $2,000 to the 
Life-Savers for the Armando campaign. The money would pay for blood tests of 
potential donors, said Rafkin, who noted that analysis of each tablespoon-size 
sample typically costs $75. 
</P>
<P>
VivaMart also contributed $5,000 toward the blood tests and encouraged its 
employees to assist at Life-Savers' tables Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday, the work had paid off, Rifkin said, noting that 72 people were 
tested. But she added that the Santa Ana campaign would continue this month -- 
with new test sites at community centers and churches. LANIE JONES

PLAN WOULD BENEFIT STAFF ON ACTIVE DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City employees who are called to active military duty during the Persian Gulf 
crisis could continue to receive a paycheck and health benefits if the City 
Council passes a proposed resolution today. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls for the city to compensate employees for any difference in 
pay as a result of being called to duty. 
</P>
<P>
The city would also continue to pay health and dental benefits for employees' 
families until next June 30. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only two city employees have been called to active duty, but up to 25 
could eventually be called, according to Swadesh Chopra, deputy director of 
personnel services. 
</P>
<P>
Current city rules state that employees called to active duty are granted a 
leave of absence with full pay and benefits for up to 30 days each calendar 
year. This has been sufficient in the past, since the active duty of reservists 
has typically lasted only two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, both the Anaheim and Costa Mesa city councils passed resolutions 
extending benefits or pay to employees called to active duty.

ARBY'S ROBBED; SUSPECT CAPTURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man wearing a red Halloween mask and wielding what turned out to be a toy gun 
escaped with $2,000 from a fast-food restaurant, only to be captured a few 
minutes later, police and witnesses said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Grab the money, grab the money,' and then he grabbed me around the 
neck and put the gun to my head," said Amber Garcia, 16, who has worked in the 
Arby's at 7942 Edinger Ave. for six months. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman then told employees to sit on the floor and look the other way while 
one of them opened the restaurant's safe and got the money, Garcia added. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the robber had showed up at the restaurant at about 2:45 p.m. 
Saturday. He accosted an employee outside the restaurant and put a gun in her 
side, police said. He then ordered the employee to "get him inside," police 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said she heard the bell at the back door ring and asked who it was. When 
her manager answered, Garcia opened the door. Her manager stood outside, 
clutched tightly by a masked man pressing a gun to her. 
</P>
<P>
Although it turned out to be a toy, police said the plastic gun was a replica 
of an Uzi machine gun. Garcia said it had been scuffed to look more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
Once employees had turned over the cash, the gunman fled out the back door and 
police were notified. A few minutes later, officers in a police helicopter 
spotted a man a few blocks away whose clothing matched the employees' 
description of the robber's. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Evans DaVeiga of Long Beach, 24 and unemployed, was arrested on suspicion 
of robbery and was being held in Huntington Beach City Jail Sunday.

HOMEOWNERS GROUP SPLITS ON POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
North Laguna Beach residents dissatisfied with their homeowners association 
have formed a new community group. 
</P>
<P>
The disgruntled homeowners say they object, in part, to the North Laguna 
Community Assn. board members' attempt to politicize neighborhood affairs 
through endorsements of local candidates seeking public offices. The 
controversy has simmered in north Laguna for the past year, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
Three candidates in last month's City Council race were from north Laguna, and 
association President Don Black has been a council candidate in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Blount and Louis Garfin, president and vice president of the splinter 
group, resigned from the North Laguna Community Assn. board in April. Blount 
said he stepped down when the board voted to mail ballots to homeowners seeking 
approval for candidate endorsements just weeks after endorsements were rejected 
by the general membership. 
</P>
<P>
Blount said residents decided to form a separate group after the board refused 
to release the homeowners association's membership list. The dissatisfied 
residents had hoped to use the list for a mailing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Black said the board attempted to satisfy grievances of the residents but was 
justified in not relinquishing the membership list. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fine if they wish to do that," Black said of the new group's 
formation. "But I don't think they should do it on the coattails of an 
organization that's been around for 25 years." 
</P>
<P>
Blount said he believes that allowing an association to make an endorsement 
when individual residents may have varying opinions about candidates "just 
divides the community right down the middle." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Thursday, Bobbie Minkin, former mayor and a vice 
president of the splinter group, said the original homeowners association has 
"tried to ram politics down the throats of north Lagunans instead of offering 
solutions to neighborhood problems. We feel the North Laguna Community Assn. 
board has lost credibility with its membership, residents and the City 
Council." 
</P>
<P>
Association board member William Buckley said that the residents' decision to 
form a separate group is "a very satisfactory thing" and that he is not worried 
about having another association within the community. 
</P>
<P>
Several other Laguna Beach homeowners associations endorse local candidates, 
including the Top of the World and Temple Hills neighborhood associations, he 
said. LESLIE EARNEST

TOXIC WASTE TANK HEARING SCHEDULED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services will conduct a public hearing Wednesday 
on the Navy's request to continue operating two hazardous waste storage tanks 
at the Naval Weapons station in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The health department and the federal Environmental Protection Agency will 
consider public comments before deciding whether to issue a permit. 
</P>
<P>
The permit was originally granted in 1983 for two tanks with a capacity of 
about 9,000 gallons each. A new permit would be for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The tanks are currently used to store waste that includes used motor oil, paint 
thinner, battery acid and lacquer thinner, said Naval base spokesman Tom 
Thomas. Waste is stored for up to 120 days and is then sent off base for 
disposal, except for used motor oil, which is sold to recyclers. 
</P>
<P>
Although Thomas said there have been no accidents or spills at the storage 
tanks, some residents, including Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings, oppose 
extending the permits. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm vitally concerned about it," Hastings said. "My concern is that the Navy 
is not being a good neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
Hastings argued that having hazardous waste site near the residential community 
is inappropriate and added that she objects to the Navy's practice of 
transferring waste from its facility in Fallbrook to Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said that the majority of the waste stored in Seal Beach is generated 
there and that material is transferred from Fallbrook because the site there is 
an annex to the Seal Beach base. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will be at 7 p.m. in the Seal Beach City Council Chambers, 211 8th 
Street. SHANNON SANDS

<P>
YOUTH, MAN HELD IN HOLDUP, THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A teen-ager accused of holding up a Cypress woman at gunpoint outside a local 
supermarket was being held Sunday after a countywide bulletin for the woman's 
stolen car turned up the vehicle and led to the arrest of the youth and a man, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, a 56-year-old Cypress resident, was held up in the parking lot of 
the Albertson's supermarket at Ball Road and Valley View Street. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspect produced a handgun and demanded the keys to her car," said Cypress 
police dispatcher Terry Berecochea. "He also demanded her purse, which she 
surrendered after a brief struggle. The suspect then fled the area in the 
victim's car." 
</P>
<P>
After interviewing the woman, Cypress police broadcast a bulletin describing 
her vehicle. Fullerton police spotted the car about an hour later on Harbor 
Boulevard near the Riverside Freeway. Two people were inside, and both were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
One, a 15-year-old Compton boy, was booked on suspicion of robbery for 
allegedly holding up the woman in the parking lot. The other, identified as 
Manjit Singh, 25, of Anaheim, was arrested on suspicion of possessing stolen 
property -- the victim's car.

ANGELUS LEAGUE; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MARGARITA PLANS FOR STRESS TESTS; 
</P>
<P>
BOYS: EAGLES WILL TRY TO KEEP UP AGAINST THE LIKES OF MATER DEI AND SERVITE, 
BOTH DEFENDING STATE CHAMPIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After a couple of stress-free years in the Olympic League, the Santa Margarita 
High School basketball team now dances with wolves. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles are now in the Angelus League, where basketball is serious business. 
It had not one but two state champions in 1990 (Mater Dei in Division I and 
Servite in Division III). And Mater Dei has won six Southern Section and seven 
league titles in the past eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Also joining the league are Loyola (1990 5-A runner-up) and St. John Bosco, 
both from the Del Rey League. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at 10 real intense games when we get into league," said Roger 
Holmes, a first-year coach at Santa Margarita. "Up and down the line, there are 
tough teams. This is probably the best league in the Southern Section." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles, who have their first senior class, finished tied for fourth in the 
Olympic League last season. And there is one coach -- Mater Dei's Gary McKnight 
-- who thinks they'll win the Angelus title. 
</P>
<P>
Of course every other league coach picks the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
"How could you not pick Mater Dei?" Bishop Amat Coach Alex Acosta said. "It's 
like a tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Here's a closer look: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BISHOP AMAT 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Alex Acosta (fifth year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 17-11, 1-7 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Five. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: None. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Randy Edwards (G, 6-2, Jr.); Scott Fields (F, 6-4, Jr.); David 
Ng (C, 6-8, Jr.); Rashid Strode (G, 5-10, Jr.); Kareem Webb (G, 6-4, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Jelani Gardner (G, 6-4, Fr); Brandon Lee (F, 6-5, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Lancers reached the quarterfinals of the 4-AA playoffs and have a 
good core of returning players. Acosta said Gardner could end up the best in 
the school's history. He is a big guard who can play point guard or off guard. 
The key is the development of the front-line players, especially Ng. Through 
the first few games, Lee has been the team's top player. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOYOLA 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bill Thomason (15th year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 23-5, 8-0 in Del Rey League. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: One. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: None. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnee: Andrew Doran (F, 6-2, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Toby Bailey (F, 6-4, Fr.); Scott Kinlock (G, 5-11, Jr.); Matt 
McMahon (F, 6-4, Jr.); Kenny Simpson (F, 6-3, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Cubs lost their nucleus as center Ryan Jaminson (California), 
forward Jamal Adams (Columbia) and guard Eric Jones (Cal Poly Pomona) 
graduated. Still, Loyola is off to a 3-0 start and has a good group of 
underclassmen. "I guess we're a little better off than I thought," Thomason 
said. "I can't point out why we've had success so far, except that everyone on 
the team is playing hard." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MATER DEI 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Gary McKnight (ninth year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 34-1, 8-0 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: None. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: J.J. Ballesteros (G, 6-1, Sr.); Reggie Geary (G, 6-2, Sr.); Mark 
Moneypenny (C, 6-11, Sr.); Kamran Sufi (G, 5-10, So.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Jason Janeski (F/C, 6-7, Sr.); DeJuan Matthews (G, 6-0, So.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: True, the Monarchs lack experience, but they have talent. Geary has 
plenty of ability and can be counted on to score. Janeski is a solid inside 
player, and Ballesteros could be the best point guard in the school's history. 
Moneypenny is the question mark. "He has to start playing like he's 6-11," 
McKnight said. "I think this will be a very good team in February." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ST. JOHN BOSCO 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Tim Haley (fifth year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 9-16, 3-5 in Del Rey League. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Eric Nelson (F, 6-2, Sr.); Dashon Quiette (G, 5-11, Sr.); 
Fiedencio Saldana (C, 6-4, Sr.); Mario Saucedo (F, 6-3, Sr). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomer: Michael Stephens (G, 6-2, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: With the four starters back, the Braves have more experience than any 
other team in the league. However, it's the same group that finished third in 
league play and was routed by Dominguez in the first-round of the 4-AA 
playoffs. Quiette is the best of the bunch. He is a third-year starter and was 
a first-team all-Del Rey League selection last season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SANTA MARGARITA 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Roger Holmes (first year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 13-13, 8-6 in Olympic League. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Eight. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Five. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Dan Bathey (G, 6-4, Jr.); Mike Carpenter (G, 6-0, Jr.); Hayes 
Ferry (F, 6-0, F); Mike Guevara (G, 6-0, Sr.); Chris Hacker (C, 6-8, Sr.); Jeff 
Layne (C, 6-8, Sr.); Sean Stevenson (F, 6-5, Sr.); Chris Stone (F, 6-2, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: None. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Eagles reached the quarterfinals of the 2-AA playoffs and have 
everyone back. Bathey is a great shooter and is averaging 20 points so far. 
Hacker and Layne give the Eagles plenty of size. "We don't have a lot of true 
basketball players, but we have a lot of guys who love to play," Holmes said. 
"I think our biggest asset is that we play as a team. We're going to need 
that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SERVITE 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Richard Smith (second year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 21-11, 4-4 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: One. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Adam Anderson (F, 6-4 1/2, Jr.); Dan Coady (C, 6-6, Sr.); Eric 
Osterhues (F, 6-4, Sr.); Eddie Rubio (G, 6-2, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Ryan Dodd (F, 6-3, Jr.); Mark Grassman (C, 6-6, So.); Matt 
Kenney (G, 6-0, Jr.); Garrett Moran (G, 6-1, Sr.); Tony Tapan (G, 5-9, So.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Servite has Anderson, who may be among the top five players in the 
league. Last season, he averaged 12 points and was a tough defender. Coady and 
Rubio were the sixth and seventh men most of last season. Osterhues saw 
considerable playing time early in the season, but was hampered by injuries the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow -- Century League.

ON THE PREP PATH / BARBIE LUDOVISE: WITH CHAMPIONSHIPS DECIDED, THE MEMORIES 
ARE TAKING HOLD

It will be difficult to forget the oh-so-cool look of confidence in quarterback 
Tony Solliday's eyes. . . . the passion and precision in that last-minute 
drive. . . . the boyish expression of wondrous disbelief on Coach Eric Patton's 
face. 
</P>
<P>
It will be difficult to forget the frenzied blur of fans rushing to hug and 
shake hands. . . . the pint-sized souvenir-seekers begging for a player's 
jersey. . . . the tears of joy streaming down the face of linebacker Matt 
(Motor) Mosebrook as he wept like a baby in his father's arms. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley High School's 17-15 victory over Paramount in the Division II 
championship game Saturday was, if not the stuff of dreams, the stuff of 
indelible memories. 
</P>
<P>
As a reporter, you're supposed to watch all athletic contests without showing 
even a trace of favoritism. You are a professional -- you never root or cheer, 
not even under your breath. 
</P>
<P>
But I'm a sucker for the underdog. 
</P>
<P>
Congratulations, Capo Valley. Way to go. 
</P>
<P>
I watched Paramount dismantle El Toro in last year's Division III title game. I 
remember how Paramount running back Leon Neal, then a junior, scampered around 
the Charger defense like a rodeo clown runs around broncos and bulls. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't give Capo Valley a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's those Cougar costumes the mascots wear. Too cute. Too cuddly. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it's because Eric Patton is too nice a guy. Too much a teddy bear. 
I've never heard him swear, never seen him throw fits or clipboards. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of coaches in the South Coast League seem to base their philosophy on 
"Winning Through Intimidation." Not Patton. This is a man who, during the 
electrifying winning drive Saturday, turned to a reporter, grinned 
mischievously and said, "This exciting enough for you?" 
</P>
<P>
It was as if, in the middle of a miracle, he had called a timeout to make sure 
everyone was enjoying the moment as much as he was. 
</P>
<P>
"I think at that time of the game you have to become philosophical," he said 
Sunday. "You've done all the work, you're in a situation to win a game, it's 
just a matter of letting things happen." 
</P>
<P>
And thanking fate when what happens coincides with your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sullivan rushed to his car Friday afternoon, already late for Sunny Hills' 
pregame festivities. The Division VI championship against Tustin was less than 
six hours away, and Sullivan, a senior running back/defensive back, was trying 
to remain calm. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan turned the key in the ignition. Nothing happened. He turned it again. 
Nothing still. The car seemed as dead as dirt, and Sullivan began to panic. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just sitting there going, 'Oh, great!' " said Sullivan, normally an 
unflappable guy. "I mean, I have this habit of being late as it is." 
</P>
<P>
Seconds turned into minutes, and Sullivan knew he was going to miss the pregame 
meal and pep talk by Ram safety Anthony Newman. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Sullivan, a 4.2 student, discovered the problem. It was marked with a 
capital 'D.' The car was in "drive." 
</P>
<P>
Add Sullivan: It was that kind of afternoon for Sullivan. But what a night. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills won the title, 7-3. For those normally lulled by defense, this game 
was no snooze fest. Action was running all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
Like big hits? Try Sullivan's sonic-boom smack on Ron Goods in the first 
quarter. The force popped Goods' helmet off like a cork popping from a bottle 
of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Like goal-line stands? Try Sunny Hills' snuffing of fullback Visko Ancich, the 
boy battering ram, inside the 10-yard-line with seven minutes to go. Tustin had 
to settle for a field goal, the only points the Tillers would score in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I just knew, no matter what, I wasn't letting anyone get by me," Sullivan 
said. "Then we got the ball back, and everyone just had this huge shot of 
adrenaline. I think it was something deep down inside, like there was a sense 
of urgency." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, like, there's only 6:41 to play, so put it in drive. 
</P>
<P>
And drive they did, all the way to within about a foot of the goal line. Sunny 
Hills Coach Tim Devaney called a timeout. He called for a sweep outside. His 
players stood and glared. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize how close we were to the goal line," Devaney said. "We were 
gonna call a sweep, and there were just about 11 kids that basically bit my 
head off. So I changed it (to a straight-ahead run). . . . Hey, I'm not gonna 
start a fight out there with 11 guys." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan and Ken Overby, who are allowed to decide between themselves who runs 
the ball, decided to go with Overby, who was hurting with a dislocated 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"With the shoulder, I couldn't block. Or at least I knew I wouldn't be very 
effective if I tried," Overby said. "But inside plays are usually mine, so 
Sully just said, 'Go ahead and take it. I don't care who scores.' " 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't all Sullivan told him. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him if he fumbled, I'd kill him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Overby plowed across for the score, looked up and saw the clock. Twenty-nine 
seconds remained, matching the number on his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw 29 and I thought, 'Wow!' " Overby said. "Pretty neat." 
</P>
<P>
Paging Edward Scissorhands: Sunny Hills' athletic trainer Steve Nicholas will 
be the latest victim of the head-shave syndrome that seems to motivate so many 
teams these days. 
</P>
<P>
According to the players, Nicholas agreed he would allow them to "style" his 
hair any way they want if they won the Division VI championship. Their 
imaginations are now working overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gonna put 'CIF Champs' on one side of his head, the score of the game on 
the other, and a Mohawk down the middle," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should shave it so it's totally bald except for one little halo on 
the top," linebacker Shannon Nipp said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want something wild," said Overby, the one who will do the cutting. 
"Some say shave everything but a patch on top. Some say shave right down the 
middle. The guys he works with say give him a bowl cut. Others are saying just 
shave a big ol' bald spot on top of his hair so it looks just like Coach 
Devaney's." 
</P>
<P>
Add shaved heads: Esperanza Coach Gary Meek, who had his head shaved when his 
team won the Empire League title, said that despite the fact that the Aztecs 
won the Division III title Saturday night by beating St. Paul, 25-7, no one's 
touching a hair on his head. 
</P>
<P>
"My body's been abused enough," said Meek, who was doused with a jug of ice 
water after the game. "I don't need any more of that." 
</P>
<P>
Big-time bucks: Whittier Christian's Division IX final against Tehachapi 
Saturday night was originally scheduled to be held at Tehachapi High School. 
But some at Whittier Christian didn't feel the atmosphere there was one 
befitting a championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Herald boosters said that if it was all right with Tehachapi, they'd rather 
have the game at Bakersfield College, and they offered to pay the difference in 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
That glamorous Bakersfield atmosphere didn't come cheap. The Whittier Christian 
boosters shelled out $2,000, money they had saved for their January football 
awards banquet. 
</P>
<P>
The 4,500 fans that watched Whittier Christian win, 34-21, can now stand and 
cheer in appreciation of the boosters' generosity.

U.S. INVESTIGATING OVERCHARGES ON HOME LOANS; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: SEVERAL AGENCIES ARE LOOKING INTO CLAIMS THAT BORROWERS MAY HAVE PAID 
UP TO $8 BILLION MORE THAN NECESSARY ON ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES.

<P>
Troubled by growing evidence that mortgage borrowers may have been overcharged 
by billions of dollars on adjustable-rate loans, federal regulators are taking 
a closer look at those loans in examinations of banks and thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued an advisory last month 
urging the 4,000 or so national banks to conduct internal audits of 
adjustable-rate mortgage pricing before examiners arrive. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. have issued similar warnings and are gathering data to 
gauge the extent of the miscalculations of ARM rates. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies are moving as concern escalates that banks and thrifts -- 
including failed institutions now under government control -- could be on the 
hook for what one former thrift regulator estimates is as much as $8 billion in 
overcharges. 
</P>
<P>
The issue came to light last year when the former regulator, John Geddes, a 
consultant who monitors interest rates for borrowers, found adjustable-rate 
mortgages in the Midwest riddled with errors. 
</P>
<P>
Many lenders are said to have miscalculated the periodic resetting of interest 
rates on the adjustable mortgages, which rose to popularity in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
There is still no authoritative data on the extent of the problem nationwide, 
but a study released last week by the General Accounting Office hinted at it: 
Three analysts were quoted as estimating that 20 to 25% of the loans are 
incorrectly adjusted. A third expert put the error rate at 31%. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of borrowers may be affected. Until about two years ago, 
the majority of new mortgages were being originated at adjustable rates; the 
proportion has since slipped to about 30%. The Mortgage Bankers Assn. of 
America estimates that nearly 4 million ARMs were originated by banks, thrifts 
and mortgage banks in 1987-89. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us regulators are concerned," said Michael Rouse, senior review 
examiner with the Federal Reserve Board's division of consumer and community 
affairs. "We are all trying to make a detailed effort to see what the scope of 
the problem is." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a serious problem," said David Ginsburg, president of Loantech Inc., a 
mortgage consulting firm in Gaithersburg, Md. ". . . There are a lot of errors 
out there, and they are costing lenders and borrowers money." 
</P>
<P>
Armed with data from Geddes, mortgage borrowers in Indiana and Ohio have filed 
a spate of lawsuits in recent months seeking damages from savings institutions 
as large as $5-billion-asset TransOhio Savings Bank in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Geddes, who is chief executive of Consumer Loan Advocates Inc. in Lake Bluff, 
Ill., says thrifts are not the only institutions guilty of overcharging. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of problems in Florida, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas," he said. The 
Southwest "has a wide-scale problem that nobody is talking about." 
</P>
<P>
A former employee of the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp., Geddes 
blew the whistle on Midwestern S&amp;Ls in 1989. He conducted a study of more 
than 7,000 adjustable-rate loans made by dozens of failed thrifts and found 
that borrowers were overcharged nearly half of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Loantech also studied 400 ARMs at banks and S&amp;Ls and found errors in 28% of 
the loans.

JOE SAMPLE COULD STAND TO TAKE RISKS

Joe Sample makes medium art. 
</P>
<P>
The pianist, who offered his amalgam of jazz, pop, R&amp;B and Latin influences 
Saturday at the Celebrity Theatre, is like fellow keyboardist Ramsey Lewis: he 
plays unpretentiously, with sincerity and with more than a modicum of flair, 
dynamics and creativity, yet he never reaches for the skies of high art, where 
compositions and improvisations can cause a listener to leave a venue a changed 
person. 
</P>
<P>
Sample seeks to entertain, not enlighten. He's a musician for the masses. Which 
is not to say he's mediocre -- far from it -- and doesn't mean he doesn't come 
across with the goods -- he does. 
</P>
<P>
At the Celebrity, the 51-year-old pianist, who's known both for his work with 
the jazz-funking Crusaders, of which he was a founding member, and his solo 
albums like "Rainbow Seeker" and "Spellbound," put his mark on what he played. 
His distinctive touch, nice bluesy feel and considerable warmth were always in 
evidence, as renditions of tunes such as "A Desert in Monterey," "Bones Jive," 
"Ashes to Ashes," "Georgia on My Mind" (the only non-original performed) and 
"Sermonized" readily proved. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the salt-and-pepper-goateed Sample is not a risk taker, and he didn't 
stretch his boundaries a lot. His tunes, with their catchy, ear-friendly 
melodies, backbeat rhythmic orientation and relatively non-complex harmonic 
constructions, were, after a while, a little difficult to distinguish from one 
another and in effect offered limited platforms for soloing. It's as if a 
painter were working in only four shades of orange or blue or brown: given the 
commonality of your material, it's hard to find new ways to tell your story. 
</P>
<P>
Yet within his chosen frameworks, Sample did just that, told modest tales and 
created a series of authentic, honest moods. With excellent backup support from 
Neil Larsen (keyboards), John Pena (electric bass), Land Richards (drums) and 
Lennie Castro (Latin percussion), the leader, leaning into his instrument as he 
worked, explored his tunes with scalar runs, funky turns, dancing chordal 
ascents, high-end tinkles and low rumbling chords, keeping the feeling -- if 
not the melody -- of his chosen theme in the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
The close-to-two-hour show had its share of highlights. "Sermonized," which was 
reminiscent of the evocative funk that made the Crusaders so popular, moved 
from a quiet, somber mood that spoke of both sadness and beauty to a spirited, 
uplifting setting, replete with banged chords and a gospelish tinge, and back. 
Then Pena issued walking bass lines instead of his usual punchy, brief 
thoughts, Richards switched to a bop time feel and Larsen, his synthesizer 
sounding like a steam calliope, soloed, going with everything from frantic 
scurries to high-pitched squeals. The tune closed as it began. 
</P>
<P>
"Bones Jive," which cooked from start to stop, was a charged item where the 
leader dug in deep and wailed, with the band right there on his tail, 
especially Castro, who issued whaps on his bongos, then his congas, to further 
drive the leader. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly moving were "Ashes to Ashes," the title track of Sample's latest 
Warner Bros. album, and the unaccompanied and soulful version of "Georgia," 
where his mixture of blues statements and flowing chordal ideas enhanced his 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of "Carmel," which concluded the show, Sample received a standing 
ovation. He then played two encores: his second was "Rainbow Seeker," perhaps 
his most popular piece. 
</P>
<P>
Sample, who appears Thursday at the Ventura Theatre, Friday at the Raymond 
Theatre in Pasadena and Sunday at the Hop in Riverside, needs to open up his 
horizons and challenge himself a bit more. His music, good now, would only get 
better.

CAMERATA PUTS NICETIES ASIDE FOR PHRASING

One generation looking toward another proved common to two of the three works 
for strings played by the Mozart Camerata under the direction of Ami Porat on 
Saturday at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
The soloists in Bach's Concerto in D minor for Two Violins were Camerata 
concertmaster Endre Granat (also concertmaster of the Pacific Symphony) and 
Dorota Anderszewska, a student of Granat at CalArts in Valencia and a member of 
the Camerata. 
</P>
<P>
While Granat played with sweetness, strength and subtlety, Anderszewska, 
perhaps understandably experiencing some nerves in the situation, tended toward 
matching but self-effacing statement. One also heard instances of dislocated 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the soloists nor the conductor appeared too preoccupied with 
reproducing period-style niceties regarding short, crisp detached bowing or 
vibratoless tone. Instead, they concentrated on lyric, forceful and 
rounded-over phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
For encores, the soloists played three pieces from the books of Duos for two 
violins by Bartok. 
</P>
<P>
Josef Suk, a student of Dvorak who would later marry his daughter Otilie, 
composed his Serenade in E-flat for String Orchestra in 1892 when he was 18, 
undoubtedly drawing on the earlier composer's Serenade in E as a model. 
</P>
<P>
Suk's Serenade also gives off a sense of outdoor airiness, although the 
composer etches his themes with more boldness and allows the shadows to intrude 
more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Porat drew out the drama with commitment and attention but was unable to 
overcome the squareness of the Adagio theme. Although there were moments of 
blurred articulation and apparent loss of shape and direction, the ensemble 
generally responded with unanimity and precision. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor opened the program with Franz Benda's Symphony in C, eliciting 
the springy elegance and optimistic spirit of the work with well-judged 
dynamics and a sense of spontaneity.

Classical East Indian dancer Ramya Harishankar will be recommended for a 
listing on the Touring Artists Directory of the California Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council, whose touring directory review panel on Friday gave the Irvine 
resident a score of 3 on a scale of 1 to 4, will reimburse performing arts 
organizations in the state that present artists on the roster in the 1992-93 
and 1993-94 seasons. Harishankar, director of the Arpana Dance Company, would 
tour alone. She is the sole Orange County resident to have requested the 
support this year. None did last year. The council is slated to vote on the 
recommendation in Los Angeles in January.

COAST DEBUT FOR RUTTER'S 'MAGNIFICAT'

<TEXT>
<P>
Christmas concert season has begun, which means it's time, in most quarters, 
for Handel's "Messiah." But William Hall and the Master Chorale of Orange 
County decided on a different route for their holiday program, performed in 
Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It's a decision that has its risks, not the least of which is that most 
Christmas choral music pales in comparison to Handel's masterpiece. Most of 
what the Master Chorale performed Saturday did so -- including and especially 
the evening's main event, the "Magnificat" by English composer John Rutter, in 
its reported West Coast premiere. 
</P>
<P>
The piece is a virtual encyclopedia of musical cliches, a long-winded, tamely 
tonal, predictable exercise in glitzy populism. In it, Rutter makes plentiful 
use of composers past and present, from Copland to Vaughan Williams, from 
Stravinsky to John Williams. He starts right off in the first movement (out of 
seven) by crossing Carl Orff with the Marlboro theme. 
</P>
<P>
To this kind of drivingly rhythmic, choral heftiness he adds plenty of 
contrast, in the form of gushingly sentimental pop ballads. The Latin text, 
given the context, sounds ridiculous throughout, but especially here. 
</P>
<P>
Mezzo-soprano Deborah Winsor-Williams sang the ballads with simple point and 
generous tone, despite occasional strain. The choir, as throughout the evening, 
sang with massive gusto, astute balance and precise ensemble. It was never in 
danger of being overpowered by the considerable orchestral contribution, played 
energetically by the so-called Master Chorale Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere the program consisted mostly of slick arrangements of carols: There 
were more medleys than in a Sammy Davis Jr. act, more modulations than on a 
dozen Barry Manilow albums. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa Children's Chorus made its debut performance, singing solidly in 
antiphony with the chorale in "While by My Sheep." The Californians, a small 
group of women singers, made a campy appearance, singing, among other things, 
"Mr. Santa" to the tune of an Andrews-Sisters style "Mr. Sandman." 
</P>
<P>
The high points of the evening: Daniel Pinkham's Renaissance-tinged "Gloria," 
and two refreshingly simple, a cappella arrangements of carols by Hall. Good 
music is the best way to celebrate Christmas.

Paul Carpenter, a former legislative leader convicted of shaking down special 
interests for campaign contributions, was sentenced today to 12 years in 
federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Garcia, rejecting the prosecutor's request for a 
15-year term, said Carpenter will be eligible for parole in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia also refused a defense request that Carpenter be given probation and 
required to perform community service. 
</P>
<P>
The silver-haired Carpenter, 62, stood silently while sentence was pronounced 
by Garcia, who described the evidence against him as "overwhelming." The judge 
said he selected the 12-year sentence to punish Carpenter and to deter others. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter was convicted in September of engaging in racketeering, extortion and 
conspiracy. Prosecutors said he used his former Senate office to extract 
campaign contributions from special interests.

L.A. DEPUTIES CONVICTED;

6 GUILTY OF SKIMMING DRUG MONEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Six members of an elite Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department narcotics team 
were convicted today on charges of conspiring to steal thousands of dollars 
during drug arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Culminating the worst corruption scandal in the department's history, a federal 
jury delivered 25 unanimous guilty verdicts out of a 54-criminal-count 
indictment that included theft, fraud, money laundering, threats of violence 
and racketeering-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
A seventh deputy was convicted on a tax violation, but the jury was unable to 
reach verdicts on conspiracy and theft charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
The jury unanimously concluded that six of the deputies had stolen $48,000 in 
an incident recorded on videotape as part of an FBI sting. Prosecutors 
initially alleged that the deputies had skimmed as much as $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
After six days of deliberation, the jury deadlocked on 26 remaining charges, on 
which U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie declared a mistrial. The jury also 
reached three unanimous not-guilty verdicts pertaining to the alleged theft of 
$527,000 by three of the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Their supervisor, former Sheriff's Sgt. Ronald Sobel, had already pleaded 
guilty and was the key prosecution witness. He testified that it was common 
practice for those on the narcotics unit and deputies on other drug squads to 
steal money during arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the officers declined to comment following the verdict. One of the 
seven, Deputy James R. Bauder, said: "I'm sure this jury did the best job they 
could. But we're disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
All of the deputies remain free on bail pending sentencing in January and 
February. The length of their likely prison terms is unclear. Had they been 
convicted on all counts, each deputy could have faced from 58 years to 128 
years in prison and $1.3 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Bauder, the deputies convicted on conspiracy and theft charges 
were Terrell H. Amers, Eufrasio G. Cortez, Ronald E. Daub, John C. Dickenson 
and Daniel Garner. All six belonged to a narcotics unit called Majors II that 
investigated high-level drug traffickers and money launderers. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Macario Duran, who was not a member of Majors II, was convicted only of 
a tax violation, in which he allegedly attempted to conceal large bank deposits 
that prosecutors said were part of the skimmed funds. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Sobel's testimony, prosecutors buttressed their case with the 
videotape of an FBI sting that appeared to show Bauder and Garner stealing 
cash. Prosecutors also used a secret audio recording made by Sobel of several 
deputies and financial records that purportedly detailed "vast, outlandish 
expenses" impossible to support on a deputy's salary. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the deputies testified that the money they were spending came from a 
variety of legal sources, including inheritances, gifts, outside jobs and legal 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel, who was attacked by defense attorneys as a liar, also testified that 
sheriff's deputies routinely falsified police reports and perjured themselves 
in court, planted drugs on suspects and beat them.

The massive U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf could cost more than $30 
billion -- double previous estimates -- and other countries will be asked to 
help pay the bill, defense officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said a detailed Pentagon cost analysis of the operation for 
fiscal 1991 ending next Sept. 30 is almost ready for presentation to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The officials confirmed a report in today's New York Times that the cost of 
adding more than 150,000 additional troops, hundreds of tanks, aircraft and 
ships to U.S. forces already in the region will roughly double the previously 
estimated $15-billion cost for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said other countries such as Japan, Germany and Saudi Arabia have 
already pledged about $10 billion to help pay for "Operation Desert Shield" and 
will be asked to contribute more.

<P>
A top-level review of the nation's space program recommended today that space 
shuttle flights be confined only to those that require human involvement and 
that the proposed space station be redesigned from top to bottom. 
</P>
<P>
A committee of experts said some of the concerns expressed about the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration are "deserved and occasionally even 
self-inflicted." 
</P>
<P>
Their report was released after Vice President Dan Quayle and NASA 
Administrator Richard Truly were briefed on its contents. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was asked whether some new form of management structure was 
called for, but it said "changes of such sweeping scope are inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
"Briefly stated, the committee believes that NASA, and only NASA, realistically 
possesses the essential critical mass of knowledge and expertise upon which the 
nation's civil space program can be sustained." 
</P>
<P>
The committee said NASA should start immediately to phase out some of its 
missions on the space shuttle and transfer them to a new, unmanned launch 
vehicle that would be developed. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the civil space program is overly dependent on the shuttle for 
access to space and warned that statistically, "we are likely to lose another 
space shuttle in the next several years." 
</P>
<P>
The committee recommended that the priorities of the space program be shifted 
to place primary emphasis on science. It also recommended that the space 
station be redesigned.

A natural gas explosion rocked an apartment complex at an Army base, killing a 
5-year-old girl and injuring 17 residents and rescuers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's remains were discovered in the rubble of the building early today, 
about 12 hours after it blew up, officials at Ft. Benjamin Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred hours after fire authorities arrived to investigate a gas 
leak at another building in the complex. That building was being evacuated when 
the blast hit several hundred feet away, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion, in a housing area for enlisted personnel, destroyed a 
four-family housing unit and damaged another.

FREED HOSTAGES HEADED HOME

<P>
The first wave of American hostages freed under Saddam Hussein's blanket 
release headed home today. But even as it relented and released foreign 
captives, Iraq declared that it would not compromise "one iota" over Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. consular officials in Germany said 152 Americans and four Canadians left 
Frankfurt on a Pan Am flight headed for Andrews Air Force Base, near 
Washington. Provisions aboard included hamburgers and champagne. 
</P>
<P>
While expressing relief at the freeing of the hostages, the Bush Administration 
wants nothing less than Iraq's total withdrawal from Kuwait. But the Baghdad 
government's information minister, Latif Jassim, said today that any talk of an 
Iraqi withdrawal from the emirate is "nothing but dreams and wishful thinking." 
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait is for Iraqi, whether in the past, present or future," Jassim said in a 
statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency. "We will not compromise 
one iota on Kuwaiti territory, its waters or the money and investment of the 
buried Al Sabah dynasty," he said, referring to Kuwait's deposed ruling family. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today that Iraq's release of 
foreign hostages should not raise hopes for a peaceful resolution of the 
Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
While saying that the release was "obviously very good news" for the hostages 
and their families, Cheney said it did not mean Iraq is backing away from its 
occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The illegal, immoral, illicit act of Saddam Hussein in holding hundreds of 
American hostages against their will for several months appears to be coming to 
an end," Cheney said in remarks to a defense industry group. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't believe Saddam Hussein deserves any credit for stopping a practice 
that obviously is abhorrent to the civilized world. He has to rank as one of 
the world's all-time hostage-takers," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
In the hostage exodus, about 277 Britons gathered at a downtown Baghdad hotel 
today to prepare to fly to London. Four Americans and an unspecified number of 
other Westerners also were to be given seats on the British-chartered plane, 
which can carry 350 passengers, British consular officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans who left Frankfurt today were among about 175 former captives who 
had arrived a day earlier from Baghdad aboard a U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways 
jet. 
</P>
<P>
The flight from Baghdad also included 101 former British hostages, who were 
flown this morning from Frankfurt to London, where they were greeted by 
jubilant relatives.

Northwest Airlines announced today it is buying a 25% stake in Hawaiian 
Airlines and taking over the Honolulu-based airline's route to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest will pay Hawaiian Airlines and its parent company, HAL Inc., $20 
million, which includes $7 million as a secured loan. The deal is subject to 
government approvals and other conditions, Northwest said. 
</P>
<P>
"The major component of the agreement calls for Northwest and Hawaiian to 
cooperate in areas of marketing and operations," said HAL Chairman Tom Talbot. 
"This will produce major new revenue, significant cost savings and operational 
efficiencies." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Australian route, Hawaiian Air also will transfer to Northwest its 
operating authority to fly between Guam-Saipan and Nagoya-Fukuoka, Japan.

The Bush Administration is preparing to recommend the most far-reaching 
overhaul of the nation's financial system since the Great Depression, a 
top-to-bottom revamping that could eventually change the way nearly everybody 
in the nation handles their money, the Washington Post reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals now being drafted by the Treasury Department would rewrite the laws 
that have governed U.S. banks, savings and loans, brokerage houses and 
insurance companies for half a century. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, to be made public in January, would impose new limits on federal 
deposit insurance that would take it back toward its original purpose of 
protecting small savers; would allow banks to become stockbrokers, sell 
insurance and underwrite bonds; would let Wall Street firms and other kinds of 
companies that are now banned from the banking business buy banks and would 
allow banks to buy other banks and open branches anywhere, leading to the 
creation of the first nationwide banks.

John Fairfax Group Proprietary Ltd., which owns the Sydney Morning Herald and 
three other major Australian publications, was placed into receivership today 
after banks called in outstanding debts. 
</P>
<P>
The company, one of Australia's two major newspaper groups along with Rupert 
Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd., owes about $1.31 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said directors asked for the appointment of a provisional 
liquidator for the group's finance division after banks refused to agree to a 
roll-over of a debt of $654 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu accountancy firm was then appointed receiver and 
manager at the request of John Fairfax Group's banking syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
John Fairfax, Australia's oldest media organization, also owns the Australian 
Financial Review, Business Review Weekly and The (Melbourne) Age as well as the 
Herald in Sydney. The Herald is the oldest English-language newspaper in the 
world continuously owned by the same family.

Bonuses were paid today to Japan's 4.46 million government workers, which 
include employees at government-owned corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the bonuses totaled about $24.3 billion, which is equivalent to 
2 1/2 months' pay averaging about $5,450 per person. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said public workers will receive an additional amount of year-end 
bonuses by the end of this year, as Parliament is expected to approve a wage 
hike bill for public-sector workers at its session convened today. 
</P>
<P>
Most Japanese workers receive bonuses twice a year -- summer and year-end.

NFL RACE IS AS PLANNED: MAD DASH; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: WITH THREE WEEKS TO GO, ONLY FIVE TEAMS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED FROM THE 
PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The NFL is getting just what it wanted when it expanded the playoff system to 
12 teams. With three weeks to go: 
</P>
<P>
* Only five teams have been officially eliminated -- Atlanta, New England, the 
New York Jets, Cleveland and Denver, the latter two the principals in last 
season's AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
* Five teams have clinched berths -- San Francisco, Chicago, the New York 
Giants, Buffalo and Miami. The first three are division winners, the others at 
least wild cards. 
</P>
<P>
* Four playoff teams will come from one division -- the Giants, Eagles, 
Redskins and Cowboys from the NFC East. Dallas, 1-15 last season, got back in 
the running on Sunday by being idle while Green Bay, Minnesota, Philadelphia 
and the Rams all lost. 
</P>
<P>
* A team may make the playoffs at .500 or worse, just like in those prototypes 
of playoff mediocrity, the NHL and NBA. 
</P>
<P>
* Five teams are 7-6 and five more are 6-7. All can make or miss the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
AFC -- The East comes down to the Buffalo-Miami game in two weeks. If Miami 
(10-3) wins, it holds the tiebreaker over the Bills (11-2) because of a 30-7 
victory over Buffalo earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest muddle is in the Central, where Cincinnati, Houston and Pittsburgh 
are tied at 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati has the best tiebreaker position with a 3-1 division record and two 
wins over the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
But the Oilers have three division games left -- Cleveland and Houston at home, 
Cincinnati away and could win by sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh, which is at Houston and New Orleans and home to Cleveland, can 
probably get a wild card by winning two of three. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City (9-4) leads the West over the Raiders (8-4 going into tonight's 
game in Detroit). The Chiefs hold the tiebreaker with their two wins over Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
NFC -- Things are smooth at the top, where the Giants (East), Bears (Central) 
and 49ers (West) have clinched division titles. 
</P>
<P>
Barring upsets, San Francisco (12-1) will have the home-field advantage 
throughout the playoffs; New York (11-2) will get a week off, then play at home 
and Chicago (10-3) will have to play a wild-card game, the consequence of its 
10-9 loss in Washington Sunday. The Giants also hold a tiebreaker advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Washington (8-5) is in good shape for a wild card and Philadelphia (7-6) should 
get the second, although they're inconsistent enough to blow it. 
</P>
<P>
Then come Green Bay, Minnesota, Dallas and New Orleans, all at 6-7. Green Bay 
could confuse things more with an upset of the Eagles in Philadelphia on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams (5-8) are barely alive.

CHEMICAL THAT MASKS STEROIDS FINDS A MARKET

<P>
A chemical found in the possession of a University of Texas football player in 
October is often used to mask the results of steroid tests, doctors and NCAA 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The chemical, epitestosterone, made by the Sigma Chemical Company, is 
reportedly finding its way into locker rooms where some athletes use it to beat 
steroid detection tests. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Luther, a reserve lineman for the Longhorns, was charged with possession 
of a controlled substance after police found a small vial labeled 
"epitestosterone" in his car, the Austin American-Statesman reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against Luther were dropped after tests affirmed that the chemical was 
epitestosterone rather than testosterone, which is illegal. Luther said he used 
epitestosterone to treat his shoulder for pain and inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
Epitestosterone is not available by prescription and has no medical use, said 
Dr. William Taylor, a specialist in anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said athletes can inject the chemical an hour before a drug test and 
still pass the test. 
</P>
<P>
"Athletes are very savvy, and this is just another example of it," said Frank 
Uryasz, NCAA director of sports sciences. "We're always faced with the problem 
that athletes know what to use and when to use it." 
</P>
<P>
"If an athlete has 24 hours notice, he can beat the drug test every time by 
using epitestosterone," Taylor said.

GIANTS COACH PARCELLS OUT OF HOSPITAL

New York Giants Coach Bill Parcells was released from a hospital this morning 
after undergoing treatment to relieve the pain of kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
The 49-year-old coach was hospitalized Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
He was able to attend the Giants' 23-15 victory over the Minnesota Vikings only 
after being given a pass by physicians. 
</P>
<P>
"He was yelling just like always," Giants offensive coordinator Ron Erhardt 
said after spending Sunday afternoon talking to Parcells over the headphones. 
"He didn't let up." 
</P>
<P>
Parcells returned to Morristown Memorial Hospital shortly after the game, 
nursing supervisor Betty Mills said late Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I met him downstairs and walked him to his room," Mills said. "He's in some 
pain." 
</P>
<P>
Parcells later underwent a cystoscope, a procedure designed to temporarily 
relieve the pain until an attempt is made to pulverize the stone through 
ultrasound. Parcells was released from the hospital this morning and will 
undergo the second procedure Tuesday at another facility. 
</P>
<P>
Giants public relations spokesman Ed Croke said doctors found a single stone, 
and if the procedure on Tuesday is successful, Parcells could return to work on 
Wednesday, when the Giants have their first workout of the week. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say much about it," Giants quarterback Phil Simms said. "He was in a 
lot of pain. He still yelled a lot today so maybe it didn't affect him that 
much."

EXPANSION IN THE WORKS FOR GRAND SLAM CUP; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: OFFICIALS OF THE TOURNAMENT, WHICH DEBUTS TUESDAY, SAY THEY PLAN TO 
INCLUDE WOMEN IN THE EVENT.

<TEXT>
<P>
It has been criticized and snubbed by leading players, but organizers of the 
Grand Slam Cup, the richest tennis tournament in history, are already 
considering expanding the event to include women. 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Slam Cup, which starts Tuesday in Munich's Olympic Hall, is offering 
a $6-million purse, with $2 million for the winner in the 16-man field. 
First-round losers will collect $100,000, more than many tournaments pay to the 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
The purse has been described by Boris Becker as "perverse." Becker, John 
McEnroe and Mats Wilander are skipping the inaugural event although they were 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Agassi is also absent. The American, ranked fourth in the world, first 
signed to play, but later announced he would pull out. Facing a fine and a 
suspension, Agassi reversed his decision again and said he would play. 
</P>
<P>
But Agassi suffered a rib injury during the Davis Cup final between the United 
States and Australia 10 days ago and pulled out again. 
</P>
<P>
This time he has a legitimate excuse but breaking the contract the first time 
could still cost the flamboyant 20-year-old a hefty fine. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the criticism and controversy, the Grand Slam Cup has attracted eight 
top 10 players. From the top 10, only Agassi and Becker, No. 2 in the world, 
are missing. The field is led by top-ranked Stefan Edberg and No. 3 Ivan Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
Also playing are U.S. Open champ Pete Sampras; French Open winner Andres Gomez 
of Ecuador; Michael Chang, Brad Gilbert, Aaron Krickstein, David Wheaton and 
Kevin Curren; Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia; Jonas Svensson and Christian 
Bergstroem of Sweden; Thomas Muster of Austria; Yannick Noah and Henri Leconte 
of France, and Andrei Cherkasov of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if organizers planned to expand the event to include women, tournament 
director Bill Dennis said: "Clearly, yes. This has already been intensively 
discussed between the ITF, the women's association WITA and us." 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Slam Cup is being organized by the International Tennis Federation in 
conjunction with the directors of the four Grand Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
The Assn. of Tennis Professionals has been opposed to the Grand Slam Cup, 
fearing that it was interfering with its own season-ending showcase tournament.

A light-flyweight is not to be confused with a heavy-flyweight. 
</P>
<P>
OK, Julio Cesar Chavez of Mexico is next. He retains the junior-welterweight 
title of the WBA and IBF, but not of the WBC and the WBO. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the foregoing, Mike Tyson knocks out Alex Stewart in the first 
round and inquires why he isn't fighting Evander Holyfield for the heavyweight 
title, instead of Holyfield's fighting George Foreman? 
</P>
<P>
Is Tyson some kind of communist? And why would he pose a question that logical? 
Boxing isn't founded on logic. If logic dictated the thinking of those 
connected with it, they wouldn't have gone into boxing in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, titleholders in boxing don't defend their championships against 
logical opponents. If they did, would Tyson have fought Buster Douglas? That 
fight was so logical that Tyson entered a 43-1 favorite. It is such a 
preposterous matchup that Tyson forgets to get into shape. Knocked senseless by 
Buster, who is knocked senseless by Holyfield, Tyson demands to know today why 
Holyfield isn't fighting him. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is, Holyfield is fighting Foreman, instead of Tyson, for the same 
reason Tyson fought Douglas, instead of Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
Governments change. Societies change. Attitudes change. But boxing doesn't 
change, proceeding today with the same roguery it did at the turn of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
As a fragment of what goes on, Tyson works with Don King, who not only is 
involved in the affairs of Tyson but also promotes his fights. 
</P>
<P>
Can you think of a circumstance more outrageous than a promoter's aligning 
himself with one of the principals? What would people say if the baseball 
commissioner, who runs the World Series, aligned himself with the Cincinnati 
Reds? 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Tyson, he didn't get a title fight with Holyfield, mainly 
because Holyfield doesn't care for Don King. 
</P>
<P>
So how does King respond? Unblinkingly, he charges racism, claiming that he and 
Tyson have been discriminated against . . . that Holyfield has fallen into the 
hands of white promoters. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Holyfield selected the promoters, not because they were white but 
because anyone represented an improvement over King. 
</P>
<P>
To Foreman, who is 43, the promoter is incidental. George is pulling the 
world's leg, talking up a fight in which he is selling a personality, not 
qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
George will sell it, too. As a contest, it will be a farce, And, dutifully 
fleeced, the boxing public will return for the next farce. 
</P>
<P>
You would have to say, though, that if it happens, through circumstances wholly 
flukish, that Holyfield meets Tyson, you would have something unique in boxing, 
namely, two guys in the same ring who belong there. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson appeared well-conditioned for his one-round knockout of Alex Stewart last 
Saturday. Stewart looked intimidated. You couldn't find a fighter who seemed 
more uncomfortable before a match than poor Alex. 
</P>
<P>
Nor, certainly, was his confidence bolstered by HBO commercials advising 
viewers, "Pray for Alex Stewart." If Alex needed prayers and Mike didn't, why 
was this match made? 
</P>
<P>
When Holyfield meets Foreman, on pay-TV, you feel a need for pre-fight messages 
that suggest: "Pray for the guy paying 40 bucks for this fiasco." 
</P>
<P>
At some time next year, it is logical that Tyson and Holyfield get together, 
but it's surprising, within the lifetime of many in boxing, that something 
logical ever happens.

'ROOKIE' GETS LESSON FROM PAIR OF PUNKS; 
</P>
<P>
BOX OFFICE: 'HOME ALONE' WHIPS COMPETITION WITH $14.6-MILLION WEEK. 'EDWARD 
SCISSORHANDS' TAKES IN A NICE CUT WITH LIMITED RELEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Clint Eastwood's latest action film took a beating -- yes, from an 8-year-old 
boy left home alone during the holidays -- during a box office weekend that 
also saw a special lad named "Edward Scissorhands" put in a strong performance 
in limited release. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rookie," directed by and starring Eastwood and co-starring Charlie Sheen 
as his young, upstart partner, had ticket sales of about $5.5 million on 1,862 
screens, for a weak per-screen average of $2,953. The Warner Bros. film, which 
ranked third among weekend titles, is Eastwood's second disappointment of the 
year, following his critically admired box office dud, "White Hunter, Black 
Heart." 
</P>
<P>
Released on just two screens, 20th Century Fox's "Edward Scissorhands," 
directed by Tim Burton ("Beetlejuice," "Batman") and starring Johnny Depp as an 
unusual young man with scissors for hands, had ticket sales of about $159,000 
-- for a startling $79,500 per-screen. 
</P>
<P>
Also startling was the fourth-week performance of Fox's "Home Alone," which 
again claimed the No. 1 spot -- jumping 2% over the previous week's earnings -- 
with receipts of about $14.6 million on 1,342 screens for a per-screen average 
of $10,879. 
</P>
<P>
In second place, down 29% from its opening weekend, was Columbia Pictures' 
"Misery." Directed by Rob Reiner from Stephen King's novel about an imprisoned 
writer, the film earned about $7.1 million on 1,299 screens for a per-screen 
average of $5,465. 
</P>
<P>
Orion Pictures' "Dances With Wolves" was ranked fourth, with receipts of about 
$5.3 million on 1,054 screens, an average of $5,028. Touchstone Pictures' 
"Three Men and a Little Lady" -- after just three weeks in release -- spiraled 
to fifth place with ticket sales of about $4.6 million on 1,282 screens, an 
average of $3,588. 
</P>
<P>
In other box office news, Paramount Pictures' "Ghost" earned another $1.34 
million for ninth place. With grosses of $199.94 million, the film is expected 
to materialize into the $200-million zone tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the action sequels "Predator II" and "Rocky V" continued their 
plummets. From Fox, the sixth-place "Predator II" dropped another 51% over the 
previous week, with receipts of about $2 million. And MGM/UA's "Rocky V" 
slipped another 43%, with ticket sales of approximately $1.9 million, to 
seventh place.

Bruce Willis says he thinks about suing the supermarket tabloids every day. 
</P>
<P>
"What more could they do to me?" he asks in an interview in the January edition 
of Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
Willis says tabloids have printed things he said in jest as fact and made up 
stories, like one about his saving an actress on a runaway horse. 
</P>
<P>
"In that movie, there were no horses," Willis said. "People say, 'Why do you 
care? It makes you look so good.' But if they can print that lie, they can just 
as easily print that I had sex with a goat. A lie is a lie." 
</P>
<P>
Given his feelings about tabloid reporters, Willis was asked why he agreed to 
play a tabloid reporter in his newest film, "The Bonfire of the Vanities" -- a 
character who is a ruthless, boozy scavenger of stories. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why," he replied.

It's been 24 years since Dolly Parton and her husband, Carl Dean, have appeared 
together on stage, and that's the way he wants it. 
</P>
<P>
Her Dec. 21 Christmas special on ABC, "Dolly Parton . . . Christmas at Home," 
will include her mother, father, six brothers, five sisters, about a dozen 
aunts and uncles and 15 or so nieces and nephews -- but not her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very shy, and not the least bit interested in show business," she says in 
next week's TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
They last appeared together in 1966, the year they were married, when Parton 
had to attend a music awards ceremony in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Carl rented a tuxedo for the night, and I won an award for best song of the 
year," she said. "But when we got home, he said, 'Dolly, I think you're 
terrific and talented, and I wish you the best, but don't ever ask me to 
anything like that again.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dean does not accompany Parton on the road, preferring to remain in Nashville, 
where he owns an asphalt-paving business.

X-RAY SUPPORTS AUTHENTICITY OF VAN GOGH WORK; 
</P>
<P>
ART: A SELF-PORTRAIT HOUSED AT A CONNECTICUT MUSEUM HAS BEEN DOUBTED SINCE 
1954. THE IMAGE OF AN EARLY SKETCH BENEATH THE PAINT ADDS CREDIBILITY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Museum officials locked in a battle with an art critic over the authenticity of 
a purported self-portrait by Van Gogh say they have new proof, contained in an 
X-ray of the painting. 
</P>
<P>
The X-ray, taken at Hartford's Mt. Sinai Hospital, shows the outlines of a 
sketch beneath the painting, and officials at Wadsworth Atheneum say the sketch 
was clearly done by Van Gogh in the mid-1880s. 
</P>
<P>
"With these scientific results, we now have what I believe is 'the smoking 
pistol' -- positive proof that this must be a work by Vincent van Gogh," said 
museum Director Patrick McCaughey. 
</P>
<P>
The X-ray and the picture will be exhibited side-by-side Tuesday at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
The authenticity of the 16-by-13-inch painting has been challenged repeatedly 
since it was donated to the museum in 1954 by architect Philip Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials have maintained that it is one of a series of gaunt, haunting 
self-portraits Van Gogh painted between 1886 and 1888. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Swiss art dealer and critic Walter Feilchenfeldt insisted that 
the work is a forgery or, more likely, a Van Gogh portrait painted in tribute 
by another artist. He said the painting "is not Van Gogh's style." 
</P>
<P>
The painting is to be included in an international exhibition next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The international exhibition is what really propelled us into saying, 'Let's 
sort this painting out once and for all,' " McCaughey said. "Let's see if it is 
worth $17 million or $1.70 -- $1.70 being the value of the frame." 
</P>
<P>
The museum said the X-ray disclosed a sketch of a fleshy woman in a bonnet. The 
woman looks much like the figures in Van Gogh's series of pictures of Dutch 
peasants, such as "The Potato Eaters," McCaughey said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the X-ray was turned upside down, there indeed was Mrs. Potato Eater, or 
Miss Potato Eater, seated at the pail peeling her spuds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Impoverished artists like Van Gogh painted over earlier works or painted on 
both sides of a canvas to save money.

<P>
Without explanation, prosecutors today dropped obscenity charges against a 
record store owner who had been arrested for selling the rap album "As Nasty as 
They Wanna Be" by 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
County Court-At-Law Judge Tony Jimenez III granted the prosecutors' request as 
Dave Risher's trial was set to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were going to trial today. I'm pleasantly surprised," Risher said 
as he emerged from the courtroom to cheers and applause. 
</P>
<P>
As the trial began, Assistant Dist. Atty. Pat Hancock asked that the case 
against Risher be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez honored the request and said he could not understand why it had taken 
six months to decide not to prosecute the case. 
</P>
<P>
Hancock gave no reason for the dismissal; prosecutors were not immediately 
available to discuss the decision. 
</P>
<P>
But the mother of the individual whose purchase of the album led to the charges 
said prosecutors didn't believe they had a case. 
</P>
<P>
"They chose to dismiss it because they thought they didn't have a case to put 
before a jury," said Teresa Weaver, president of Citizens Against Pornography. 
"I think if there's a blame to be placed it has to be on the (judicial) 
system." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver also said her son Patrick, who bought the album, no longer believes that 
the entire rap album met an obscenity definition. 
</P>
<P>
Based on this case, Jimenez said he will also recommend that future obscenity 
cases involving the record be dismissed. No cases are pending. 
</P>
<P>
Risher was charged in June after San Antonio police vice officers visited local 
record stores and told owners and managers that the album had been declared 
obscene by a federal judge in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
After that declaration, one record store owner in Florida was found guilty of 
misdemeanor obscenity, but in another members of the rap group were acquitted 
of similar charges involving a live performance of some of their material. 
</P>
<P>
In the Texas case, officers asked store operators to sign statements saying 
they had been given the warning. Risher refused to sign. 
</P>
<P>
Days after the warning, Patrick Weaver bought the album at Risher's store and 
filed a complaint with police. 
</P>
<P>
Promotion of pornography, a Class A misdemeanor, carries a fine of one year in 
jail, a $1,000 fine or both. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to get back to work," said Risher, owner of Hogwild Records &amp; 
Tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys had planned to call music critics, professors and a pollster 
as witnesses on Risher's behalf. Defense attorney Robert Switzer said he was 
pleased with the ruling and considered it a victory.

The U.S. Postal Service plans to seek damages from the owner of a pit bull 
described as "a canine crocodile" that attacked a mail carrier. Postal 
spokesman Dan Demiglio said that because the dog's owner, identified by humane 
officers as Carlos Jackson, turned the dog in, mail will again be delivered to 
the two-block area near Mills College. 
</P>
<P>
Mail deliveries to the neighborhood stopped after the attack on carrier Cecil 
Ivey. Demiglio had warned after the attack that mail would be withheld until 
the dog was taken out of circulation. A neighborhood resident, Shirley Bryant, 
said the dog was well known and feared in the area. The muscular pit bull 
seized Ivey, 45, by the lower right arm during his rounds, inflicting what a 
hospital spokesman called serious wounds.
