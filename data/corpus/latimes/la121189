JAIL MAY HAVE MORE CRITICS THAN INMATES; 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN: THE MAN WHO RUNS THE EL CAJON FACILITY SAYS IT'S THE WORST HE KNOWS, 
AND COUNTY SUPERVISOR GEORGE BAILEY WANTS A FULL REVIEW OF THE BUILDING THAT 
PRISONERS CAN LITERALLY KICK THEIR WAY OUT OF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ben McLaughlin, the captain in charge of the County Jail in El Cajon, peered 
out a window into Module 7-C, from which 10 inmates have escaped since the jail 
began housing them in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning, most of the men were locked in their cells (six on two 
triple bunks in each) during yet another "lockdown." In addition to escapes, 
the jail has a history of riots and in-house disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Boss, we're having a security problem right now," the guard said, referring to 
the threat of a fight breaking out. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin shook his head. Three out of seven prisoners remain at large after 
the most recent escape last month, he said, the third in six years. During the 
first escape in 1984, one prisoner fell to his death while shinnying down a 
makeshift rope of sheets. 
</P>
<P>
The captain, who has worked at the jail for almost two years, blames its 
architectural design and what he called its shoddy construction for the 
frequent escapes and for most of the other problems that haunt the most 
problematic jail in the history of San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"No unity, no continuity, no working floor plan," he said with a scowl. "It's 
spasmodic, it's hit and miss. . . . It's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin calls it the most poorly designed and worst-constructed jail that he 
knows anything about, and, at 48, he has spent his entire adult life in law 
enforcement. He says it may be everything a jail should not be, the antithesis 
of the new County Jail in Vista, which he calls "state-of-the-art, designed to 
do just what it's supposed to do, house inmates in a safe, efficient manner." 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor George Bailey, whose district includes El Cajon, agrees that 
the jail is a mess, a multimillion-dollar turkey or lemon, depending on your 
choice of metaphor. Bailey has called for a full review of the jail -- its 
design and construction, as well as who ought to manage it -- and plans to 
announce his recommendations at a Board of Supervisors meeting early next year. 
</P>
<P>
This week, he hopes to receive a report from the county's Department of General 
Services, which plans to advise that the walls of the jail -- which are made of 
plastic foam -- be reinforced with galvanized sheet metal. The cost of the 
renovation, which Bailey calls "a Band-Aid" that won't solve the problem, is an 
estimated $800,000, which is what the county saved in resorting to cost-cutting 
measures in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"Something needs to be done, and soon," Bailey said, "although I'm adamantly 
opposed to almost $1 million for a temporary measure." 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent escape, Nov. 5, seven prisoners used their fists and feet to 
punch through the wall in 7-C and descended to the ground, climbing down a rope 
made of bedsheets. 
</P>
<P>
As another temporary measure, McLaughlin has won approval to have all bedsheets 
taken away. Each prisoner will soon be issued two wool blankets -- one for 
lying on, the other for cover -- in the hope that wool makes a lousier rope 
than sheets do. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey was livid after last month's escape. 
</P>
<P>
"You have foam stuck on top of a dry wall," he said. "You can pick through it 
in a matter of minutes. I'm no expert on construction, but I do know enough 
about jails to know you'd never put that kind of a wall on a jail. It doesn't 
make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Jane Huston, director of the Department of General Services, said she was asked 
by Sheriff John Duffy, who oversees the jails, to outfit a sample cell in the 
El Cajon facility with what some people are calling "the sheet-metal solution." 
She expects to have it approved at a Board of Supervisors meeting in January. 
</P>
<P>
But Bailey may argue for a long-term solution -- such as a whole new jail. 
McLaughlin, who has to deal with the place on a day-to-day basis, also favors a 
new facility, with the current one being converted to badly needed courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"If that facility is as godawful inefficient as the sheriff says it is, then we 
ought to look toward building a new jail," Bailey said, "and get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin, Bailey, Huston, Duffy -- just about everyone connected with the 
jail -- say it is the victim of the era of retrenchment that began in earnest 
in California in the early part of the decade, after the passage of the 
property tax-cutting initiative, Proposition 13, in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of building materials, such as plastic foam on the walls, came 
about, Huston said, because money was scarce. She said the composition of the 
wall is "plastic and wire mesh and a Styrofoam filling with a textured outer 
cover," which, from East Main Street outside, makes it look like any other 
sleek, modern building, elegant and firm. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, was it a bad decision?" Huston asked. "Well, at the time, 
everyone did the best they could. Hindsight is always much easier. But, because 
of Prop. 13, everyone was scared. People tried to cut corners every way they 
could." 
</P>
<P>
A report prepared by Bailey notes that problems beset the structure almost from 
the day the architectural contract was awarded in 1976. That went to local 
architects Richard George Wheeler and Frank L. Hope, neither of whom returned 
phone calls from The Times. Proposition 13 contributed first to delays; then, 
after dissension over the size of the building, the plans were redrawn. 
Construction began in the summer of 1980. 
</P>
<P>
When bids were awarded, they went not to one general contractor but to a series 
of subcontractors. Inflation rates at the time hovered in the serious double 
digits. It was decided that the walls would consist of a new material called 
Drivit -- the trade name for the mixture of drywall with plastic foam and 
textured coating. The estimated savings: $700,000 to $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Bailey said, the project was screwed up "from stem to stern." 
</P>
<P>
In constructing the walls, mistakes were made that weakened them further. 
McLaughlin said a type of "hog wire, sprayed with blow-on cement, a light 
mixture of concrete and fiber," is meant to secure the plastic foam all along 
the wall, but, for some reason, it has been omitted from key sections. 
Authorities discovered that when one of the seven inmates put his foot through 
the wall in trying to escape Nov. 5. He was aiming for a window and missed, 
McLaughlin said, only to discover that the wall "did the trick for him." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the brouhaha over construction, virtually everyone connected with the 
Sheriff's Department cites overcrowding as the worst problem facing the El 
Cajon jail or any other in the county. Seven inmates recently escaped from the 
South Bay Detention Facility in Chula Vista by greasing themselves with butter 
and body lotion and crawling through a narrow window -- the same type of window 
used in El Cajon. (McLaughlin said the walls of the South Bay jail, however, 
are stronger.) 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, McLaughlin said, the El Cajon jail is well over capacity -- it 
has 442 inmates in a facility built for 120. It saw its highest population in 
early 1987 -- some 830 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many rats in the cage," as Bailey put it, leads to problems other than 
escape. Because of the vertical design of the building -- a concept that 
McLaughlin, for one, abhors -- inmates on the seventh floor routinely plug up 
the toilets, flooding the floors below. That means the probation staffers on 
the fifth floor never really know when it's going to rain, but they are aware 
of the threat, any moment of the day or night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's horrible," McLaughlin said. "They treat the toilet like a garbage 
disposal, and, for the most part, they do it deliberately. The poor people in 
probation are working in an untenable environment. Every night before they 
leave, they cover their desks with plastic. If they don't, first thing in the 
morning their desks are sopping wet." 
</P>
<P>
The threat of escape, the toilets, the fights that break out on the jailhouse 
floor -- a Latino-black melee last year involved more than 100 prisoners, 
resulting in 19 injuries -- and a staff of 9 deputies trying to police 50 times 
that number, none of it bothers McLaughlin as much as the building's central 
flaws. He says no jail should have a vertical construction and that if it does, 
it should have a central command post, which this one doesn't. (In the 9-story 
building, inmates are kept on the 6th, 7th and 8th floors.) 
</P>
<P>
"Everything in the jail has to go through two elevators," McLaughlin said. 
"We're talking staff, clothing, bedding, nurses, food, inmates -- everything. 
It's horribly inefficient." 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, McLaughlin routinely has to cancel meetings -- Narcotics 
Anonymous and the like -- as well as church services because there are too few 
guards to chaperon too many inmates, and too few rooms with too few chairs to 
seat inmates who wish to attend. 
</P>
<P>
"When that starts to happen," he said, "you've defeated the entire purpose of 
rehabilitation." 
</P>
<P>
As the controversy swells, the recent problems of Sheriff Duffy -- ranging from 
allegations of unreported outside income to absenteeism to being unresponsive 
to charges of jail beatings by guards -- now include the questions about the El 
Cajon complex. Bailey isn't sure the sheriff is the best person to manage the 
jails, that maybe the problem starts at the top. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Golding, chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors, recently suggested that 
the board should run the jails. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy with the Sheriff's Department," Bailey said. "Nobody in their 
right mind would want to run the (El Cajon) jail. But can it get any worse out 
there? I ask you, can it?" 
</P>

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: BOWLING JOINTS WANT YOU TO STRIKE THE WORD ALLEY FROM YOUR

<P>
I am doing penance for referring to bowling alleys. I recently posed the 
rhetorical question: Would you rather live in an area known for its golf 
courses or its bowling alleys? 
</P>
<P>
I got a hot response from Diane Elliott, marketing director for Leisure Time 
Sports Inc. of El Cajon, which runs six bowling alleys/centers/lanes/places/ 
establishments in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott wrote that I'm obviously outdated, biased and sexist. All of this from 
my comments regarding golf versus bowling. Wow, wait until she hears my 
political ideas! 
</P>
<P>
She invited/challenged/dared me to visit North County Lanes in San Marcos to 
see how things have changed. I accepted/acquiesced/knuckled under. 
</P>
<P>
North County Lanes is one of Leisure Time's newest: a clean, well-lighted 
place, with 60 lanes, video games, cable television and free child care. (Try 
asking your golf pro for that.) 
</P>
<P>
Also, a lounge, snack bar and, this being the holiday season, a fully loaded 
Christmas tree. The chandelier is a nice touch. 
</P>
<P>
There are senior leagues on most afternoons and junior bowling on Saturday. 
Nearly all leagues are co-ed. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Murtishaw, the teaching pro at North County Lanes, is constantly correcting 
people who say alleys. 
</P>
<P>
"Bowling has an image problem it is trying to shake," he said. "Some people 
just refuse to believe that bowling is no longer a bunch of beer-bellies 
smoking cigars and knocking down pins in some cellar." 
</P>
<P>
That image is obsolete at North County Lanes. Like pool halls before them, 
bowling alleys have been converted to "family fun." 
</P>
<P>
I remain retrograde, however. I worry that something has been lost in the 
sanitizing and wholesome-izing. The old hairy-knuckled alleys had their place 
in the social order. 
</P>
<P>
As either Mike Royko or Joseph Campbell once said, there are several hundred 
thousand social workers in this country but only one Minnesota Fats.

DNA PROCESS FACING TEST IN RAPE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first San Diego court test of "genetic fingerprinting" is set to begin 
today, pitting a prosecutor who is sold on the identification technique against 
a skeptical defense lawyer who claims it's relatively untested. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Carpenter, wants to use the novel 
technique to convict a man accused of raping a Pacific Beach woman. He plans to 
urge a San Diego Superior Court judge to allow him to tell a jury at the 
upcoming rape trial how genetic fingerprinting works and why it provides such 
devastating evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Judge William D. Mudd will preside over the hearing, expected to last a couple 
of weeks, while experts -- in subjects such as population genetics and 
microbiology -- duel from the stand over the technique's reliability. 
</P>
<P>
The question facing the judge is whether the technique is "generally accepted" 
in the scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
"Genetic fingerprinting" evidence has been admitted in other California 
criminal cases this year, and even in San Diego County at least once before -- 
just last week, in fact. But the evidence did not play a key role in that case, 
and the hearing before Mudd appears to mark the first time the technique will 
be challenged in county courts by an objecting defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Although the application of genetic fingerprinting in criminal cases is novel, 
it has been widely used for a variety of other applications, including 
paternity tests. 
</P>
<P>
Judges in 18 states have approved the use of the technique, and, since late 
summer, it has been allowed in cases in Ventura and Alameda counties. Judges in 
at least two states, however, have refused to allow it into court. 
</P>
<P>
Genetic fingerprinting got its name, Carpenter said in legal papers filed 
recently, because it can be used -- like a fingerprint -- to identify a 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
But while a fingerprint can only exclude a suspect, or point merely to the 
likelihood of a suspect's involvement in a crime, genetic fingerprinting can 
show -- purportedly to probabilities of billions to one -- that a particular 
crime involved a particular person. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter contends that tests run in this particular case show genetic patterns 
that point to Barrett Brooke Littleton. The prosecutor has other evidence -- 
for example, the victim identified Littleton at a photo lineup, a live lineup 
and at the preliminary hearing -- but nevertheless considers the tests 
important to his case. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're talking about is ability to get a lot closer to the truth," 
Carpenter said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Littleton's defense attorney concedes that the complicated technique is 
scientifically remarkable. It breaks down the very essence of genetics to a 
pattern that closely resembles the familiar bar codes used in pricing items at 
a grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
But public defender William D. Saunders plans to argue that the technique, 
although promising, has simply not yet proved reliable. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Saunders said recently, Littleton's case involves an issue that 
anyone who has ever been near a courtroom can understand without fancy 
technology -- a problem of mistaken identity. 
</P>
<P>
Littleton, 44, of San Diego, is charged with two counts of rape as well as oral 
copulation and burglary in connection with the Sept. 14, 1988, attack on a 
24-year-old woman at her Pacific Beach apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Police found four stains on the victim's comforter and also obtained vaginal 
swabs from her, Carpenter said in his legal papers. At first, lab technicians 
performed only standard blood tests, comparing the blood and saliva of the 
victim, her boyfriend and Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
The boyfriend, technicians found, had Type O blood. Both the victim and 
Littleton were Type A, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Further classic blood and saliva tests on the stains indicated they could have 
come from a relatively small segment of the population, roughly 15%, Carpenter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Those tests strongly suggested the likelihood of Littleton's involvement, 
Carpenter said. But the prosecutor said he decided he wanted "the individual 
identification you can get through DNA testing" -- that is, genetic 
fingerprinting. 
</P>
<P>
DNA -- or deoxyribonucleic acid -- contains the chemically encoded genetic 
information that determines each person's physical makeup. It is found in 
virtually every cell of the body and may be extracted from, among other things, 
blood or semen or their dried stains, vaginal swabs, hair roots and the lining 
of the mouth. Every person -- except for identical twins -- has links of DNA 
that are unique to him or her. Those highly variable individual links of DNA 
are what provide the basis for genetic fingerprinting. 
</P>
<P>
Although different methods exist for testing DNA, the technique essentially 
involves chemically cutting it into strips, separating the fragments into 
bands, then lining up the DNA markers according to length so they resemble the 
familiar bar codes, according to scientific and legal journals. 
</P>
<P>
Initial testing showed that a pattern taken from the vaginal swabs matched the 
pattern taken from Littleton's blood, Carpenter's brief said. 
</P>
<P>
Further testing showed that the pattern from the vaginal swabs contained her 
DNA pattern, two of eight bands taken from the boyfriend's blood and five of 
seven bands obtained from Littleton's blood, the brief said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the woman and Littleton are white. The chances in the Anglo population of 
the five bands being common to both the woman and Littleton are about 1 in 
8,100, the brief said. 
</P>
<P>
The degree to which a test can point to a particular person varies with the 
technique used and the condition of the sample, say the three major labs that 
do the tests. 
</P>
<P>
Under ideal conditions, one of the three labs claims it can determine that the 
DNA print of a given individual is unique to a statistical probability of 30 
billion to 1, according to a legal journal. Another lab advertises that its 
method can individualize to 840 million to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Odds of 8,100 to 1, Carpenter said, admittedly are "not as good as one in 800 
million, but (they're) pretty good," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders, however, contends that not only did the testing find that some of the 
DNA markers matched up with Littleton or the boyfriend or both, others bore "no 
resemblance to either person." 
</P>
<P>
"It makes the issue of identification a lot more complicated than if there were 
just two people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We contend there's somebody running around who looks like Mr. Littleton who's 
responsible for this rape, and we expect he would have a DNA pattern generally 
resembling (Littleton) because he resembles him in a general sense," Saunders 
said. "It's a classic mistaken-identity issue." 
</P>
<P>
What happened with these tests illustrates their basic problem, Saunders said. 
The tests rely on inadequate databases, he said, to assign the numerical 
frequencies that, in turn, translate into the statistical projections. 
Littleton's fluid samples, for example, were compared with those from other 
whites, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be a lot more comfortable if they had a database for blue-eyed, 
blond-headed people (like Littleton), so they could identify which bands would 
be held in common by people who have blond hair and blue eyes, instead of all 
being lumped into a Caucasian database, whatever that is," Saunders said. 
</P>
<P>
The "bugs haven't all been worked out," he said. "It's that simple."

1 DEAD, 1 MISSING AFTER BOAT BREAKS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One man was killed and another person was reported missing Sunday after their 
16-foot fishing boat broke up somewhere outside San Diego Bay, the U.S. Coast 
Guard reported. 
</P>
<P>
The motor boat, with two people aboard, left the harbor on a fishing trip 
sometime Saturday, said Chuck Long, a Coast Guard Auxiliary member and 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday morning, the pilot of another boat found the remains of the vessel 
floating just south of Point Loma, Long said. 
</P>
<P>
"Visibility was very minimal" Saturday night, Long said. "But the information 
is still sketchy as to what happened. We didn't have any good clues -- the boat 
wasn't even reported as being overdue." 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard vessels, dispatched to search the area, soon found the body of 
Chanh Huynh, 33, of San Diego, washed up on rocks. Huynh was pronounced dead on 
arrival at UC San Diego Medical Center, Long said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities found an engine, an ignition console, life jackets and portable 
fuel cans floating in the waters near Point Loma, Long said. 
</P>
<P>
They found no name on the vessel, but they did recover a fragment from the 
boat's hull that showed its 1990 license tag number. Coast Guard personnel were 
able to track down a previous owner of the boat, who said he had recently sold 
his boat to Huynh. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were later able to confirm that Huynh and a companion had left on a 
fishing trip this weekend, Long said. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Auxiliary members walked the coastline throughout the day, 
searching for the second person in the boat. The search was suspended Sunday at 
dusk and was scheduled to resume today.

AROUND THE VALLEY: LEARNING TO NOT BE LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sebastian Rotella 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The procrastinators advance across green lawns toward the Pierce College 
classroom, seeking salvation and looking sheepish. 
</P>
<P>
They are late. 
</P>
<P>
A class titled "How to Stop Procrastinating" is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. on 
a warm, lazy Saturday. Twenty students are registered. Three arrive on time. 
One is a reporter writing a column that originally was going to be written six 
months ago -- a legacy from a previous columnist who really meant to get to it 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Instructor Barbara Cheresnick-Rosenbaum, 38, has been waiting 15 minutes. She 
is a Woodland Hills psychologist and creator of "Video Aspirin," a videotape 
she describes as an antidote to stress "the natural way, without drugs, for 
only $14.95." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum wears a purple ensemble: dress, nails, high heels. She has a 
formidable air of confidence and self-discipline, a diminutive exorcist ready 
to battle the demons of sloth and lethargy. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum's watch is an hour fast. This is not part of some high-powered time 
management strategy, however. She confesses that she has put off resetting the 
watch since daylight-saving time ended. 
</P>
<P>
Someone mistakenly has scheduled Rosenbaum's class in the same room where a 
marketing class is in progress. The marketing students react with loud 
contempt, evidently unacquainted with poet Pablo Neruda's sentiment that "there 
is nothing more beautiful than wasting time." They jeer as Rosenbaum and their 
instructor discuss the mix-up: 
</P>
<P>
"That class was last year." 
</P>
<P>
"They put it off." 
</P>
<P>
"Do it tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The procrastinators retreat to a classroom next door. Eight in all, they 
include senior citizens and college students, hardened veterans and rookie 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Max is a lanky, folksy government engineer with gray hair beneath a baseball 
cap. His wife signed him up. Max accuses himself of being a workaholic and 
putting off fun things, such as vacations to Hawaii and target practice with 
his pistol. He quotes Clint Eastwood: "A man's got to know his limitations." 
</P>
<P>
Donna, the tanned mother of a tyrannical, insomniac 3-year-old, exudes health 
but complains that motherhood has put her fitness program on permanent hold. 
She calls procrastination the family vice. "You know the rabbit in 'Alice in 
Wonderland' -- 'I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date?' That's the 
story of my life." 
</P>
<P>
The procrastinators swap war stories about their battles with time. One woman 
says she combines exercise with walking her two large dogs. Max exercises at 
work whenever nature calls, climbing six flights of stairs to the farthest 
possible restroom. And he strengthens his shooting muscles by hoisting his 
briefcase repeatedly as he walks to and from the corner where he meets his van 
pool; he rises to demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
Max again rises when Diana, the young divorcee on his right, explains that she 
is emotionally scarred because she grew up in a family where nobody ever "gave 
me a hug and told me everything was OK." 
</P>
<P>
"You want a hug?" Max says. "I'll give you a hug. Everyone should get a hug." 
</P>
<P>
Max and Diana hug. Everyone beams. Rosenbaum says, "Isn't that great?" 
</P>
<P>
Then Concepcion, who sits on Max's left, discusses the hardships of living 
alone. Max wastes no time, asking, "Do you want a hug, too?" 
</P>
<P>
Concepcion complies, somewhat hesitantly. Everyone beams. Just as it looks as 
if a hugging melee might break out, Rosenbaum gets back on track. 
</P>
<P>
She explains that procrastination results from anxiety, paralyzing 
perfectionism and the understandable desire to postpone unpleasant tasks. She 
instructs the class to map out their priorities on paper. She tells them to 
imagine themselves very old, asking them what -- years from now -- they would 
think they gained and lost if they stopped procrastinating now. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not Einstein," she says. "But I can give you some good, practical 
suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum recommends that students construct schedules on daily, weekly and 
monthly matrices. The leatherbound Cadillac of personal organizers is available 
in stores for $175, a portable reminder that time is money. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum also punctuates the self-help jargon with a touch of the drill 
sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
"Repeat after me," she commands, pacing in front of the room. "It's OK to be 
less than perfect!" 
</P>
<P>
It's also OK to be a bit ruthless, apparently. 
</P>
<P>
As the students shed the shackles of aimlessness and transform themselves into 
hard-charging, agenda-toting uebermenschen, they will have to step on some 
toes. 
</P>
<P>
"So what do you delete from this schedule because it's too full?" she asks. 
"Other people. Delete others. Learn to say no." 
</P>
<P>
Practice on strangers, she says. Take no guff from telephone salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
Then unleash a stern new assertiveness on pushy friends, demanding relatives, 
even children. 
</P>
<P>
"I have lots of friends," Rosenbaum says. She explains how she recently applied 
a verbal stiff-arm to one friend who was intent on a marathon telephone chat. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a little upset. But I felt great. I had done something for me." 
</P>
<P>
After class, Max buys an $8.95 audio cassette version of "Video Aspirin." He is 
in his 60s, old enough to have seen a daughter graduate from Princeton, young 
enough to have decided that the procrastination has got to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"Just spending three hours today talking about it has helped," Max says. 
</P>
<P>
He heads off into the night: a satisfied student, proud father, philosophical 
procrastinator -- a man who knows his limitations and who plans on getting 
around to doing something about them one day.

SOMEONE ELSE GETS WHAT YOU PAY FOR; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO INSURANCE: COVERAGE IS MANDATORY; THE ASSIGNED-RISK PLAN IS SUPPOSED TO 
PAY ITS OWN WAY. ENFORCEMENT OF BOTH LAWS WOULD BRING DOWN PREMIUMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN R. WOLEN, Alan R. Wolen is an attorney with the law firm of Barger 
&amp; Wolen, representing insurers in rate hearings. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In California, auto accidents are a certainty. They occur at the rate of 48,000 
per month, or 66 per hour. About 24% involve drivers who have caused one or 
more collisions within the previous two years. There are about 650 auto 
accidents per day involving death or injury, and more than half of those 
involved drunk drivers or drivers who had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of many, these drivers should not be allowed on the streets. 
Moreover, about 15% of the drivers in Los Angeles County are uninsured, and 
more than 9% of insured drivers are covered under the state's assigned-risk 
plan. Those of us who are insured pay more than half of the premiums for 
assigned-risk drivers. Although the law creating the plan requires that 
premiums cover claims and costs, the usual interest groups prevail annually, 
preventing increases which would ensure that assigned-risk drivers pay their 
fair share. For example, an assigned-risk driver in Culver City, with bodily 
injury coverage of $15,000 per injury and $30,000 per occurrence pays $447 
annually. But a driver of the same age, in the same area, with the same model 
vehicle, who has a perfect driving record -- no violations, no accidents -- 
will pay $504 to $695 for a regular policy with the same coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Besides paying less, assigned-risk drivers have between 2 1/2 and three times 
more accidents. 
</P>
<P>
You and I subsidize these drivers through higher rates on our policies. Because 
of the bargain rate, many drivers who qualify for a regular policy are 
purchasing assigned-risk coverage. The assignment of high-risk drivers to our 
insurance companies will cost about $2 billion in claims and administrative 
costs in 1989. Premiums from these drivers will total $1 billion. The shortfall 
is made up by regularly insured drivers. 
</P>
<P>
This is one area in which we can lower our rates -- just enforce the law to 
make assigned-risk premiums cover assigned-risk costs. One major Southern 
California insurer estimates that 15% of the bodily injury and property damage 
premium is attributable to these subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
We also subsidize uninsured motorists. The state requires that insured drivers 
carry uninsured-motorist coverage, unless we specifically decline it. This 
covers us only for personal injuries, up to $15,000 per injury and $30,000 per 
occurrence. This type of coverage in the central area of Los Angeles, where as 
many as 60% of the drivers are uninsured, costs as much as $350 per car. We pay 
for these uninsured motorists through the "collision" portion of our policies. 
It is estimated that 15% of the collision premium is attributable to uninsured 
motorists. We also pay directly for these motorists in the deductible portions 
of our collision coverage and for all the repairs or a replacement vehicle if 
we have no collision coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The uninsured and those who resist increases in assigned-risk rates claim that 
they cannot afford insurance. Of course, they can afford to pay for gas, oil, 
repairs, collision coverage required by auto finance companies, monthly lease 
or purchase installments, car registration, etc. 
</P>
<P>
If legally required minimum insurance is not affordable, the driver must make 
choices. A family with two cars may have to give up one or buy a less expensive 
car. Public transportation is another alternative. In any case, the Legislature 
has already established, by law, that requirements for minimum coverage be 
observed and that assigned-risk premiums cover the costs of the plan. We do not 
tolerate other violations of law based on the violators' income, and we should 
not do so here, where the potential for death, injury and destruction is so 
great. 
</P>
<P>
Enforcement of these laws is long overdue. It need not be difficult. The state 
insurance commissioner should immediately comply with the law requiring 
adjustments to assigned-risk premiums to cover costs. As for mandatory 
coverage, there should be a vehicle registration system tied to insurance. 
Under such a system, all policies would be required to provide at least the 
minimum level of insurance for a year, coinciding with the vehicle-licensing 
cycle. Insurers would send evidence of non-cancelable insurance for the 
registration period to the Department of Motor Vehicles. Vehicles without 
current registration would be towed and impounded until registered. 
</P>
<P>
Much more can and should be done. For example, substantial reductions could 
result from implementation of a genuine "no fault" plan -- such as those in New 
York and Florida -- which would eliminate most wasteful lawsuits and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
These measures alone could provide a large reduction in premium for the average 
policyholder in Los Angeles County and eliminate the biggest part of the 
financial loss attributable to uninsured and bad drivers.

POLICE: LET POLICE MONITOR RELEASED CONVICTS, FREEING THE PROBATION STAFF TO 
WORK WITH TROUBLED KIDS BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

Recent reports have confirmed that the school-dropout plague now extends down 
into junior high schools. It is more clear than ever that our schools are in 
serious trouble and need more help than is available within the education 
system. But public education is only one of the many vital institutions that 
are unable to keep pace with demands imposed on them by an increasingly complex 
and rapidly growing society. And just as the problems of schools, social 
services and criminal justice are interrelated, so should be the solutions. 
</P>
<P>
The workload of most institutions charged with keeping society on an even keel 
has increased enormously, while their resources have remained static or have 
been reduced. But merely increasing the resources of some of those systems as 
they are now configured would not enable them to serve the people adequately. 
The crises created by child neglect, drug abuse, school dropouts, gang violence 
and the growing population of career criminals clearly illustrate the need for 
us to re-examine what public agencies are doing to fulfill their commitment to 
society. 
</P>
<P>
I propose that we begin by re-examining the role of the criminal justice system 
with the intent of encouraging greater networking of its resources with other 
social systems. The Los Angeles Unified School District's enormous dropout rate 
is a prime example of a social disorder that the criminal justice system should 
be helping to address. 
</P>
<P>
As it now functions, the criminal justice system is missing the mark by an even 
wider margin than is the education system. Perhaps the Probation Department 
provides the worst-case example of a criminal justice agency overwhelmed by an 
impossible mission that prevents it from addressing tasks at which the chances 
of success would be much higher. Failure of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District to keep kids in school is alarming. But that failure pales in 
comparison to the Probation Department's inability to control its charges -- 
career criminals who are on probation. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for this failure is simple: The probation philosophy is outmoded. 
The system needs to be totally redesigned to direct the Probation Department's 
efforts toward the young and vulnerable population, including school dropouts, 
rather than toward society's dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
It's time we put the authority for enforcing the conditions of probation with 
the police officers who witness violations firsthand. It is ludicrous to assume 
that convicted persons will comply with probation conditions when one probation 
officer is trying to monitor hundreds of them. It would be far more 
intimidating for them to realize that all police officers are monitoring their 
behavior, are informed of the conditions of probation and have the power to 
enforce the conditions immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than being perceived as an alternative to jail, probation status should 
be viewed as an extension of incarceration, an "out-prisoner" status. It is 
essential that the subject realize that he or she is still under the control of 
the criminal justice system through police monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
The benefits of these proposals are obvious. Families, schools and communities 
would support our efforts when they see that we have put some teeth back into 
the handling of out-prisoners, who constitute 80% of our convict population. 
This new approach would also encourage probationers to resist peer pressure, 
justifiably using the enforcement threat as reason to abstain from criminal 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Although this proposed change might initially place a greater burden on our 
jail facilities, it can reasonably be assumed that a stronger probation system 
would eventually reduce the need for additional prison facilities because 
probation would be a viable alternative to incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
This revision would also be a first step in addressing the issue of real 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
What is now called the Probation Department should not be downgraded in 
importance. Far from it. Rather, the department's mission should be redefined 
and its efforts redirected. 
</P>
<P>
The Probation Department's efforts are now aimed at the tail end of the 
criminal justice process; there, in dealing with society's failures, it has 
failed. where it has failed in dealing with society's failures. But with the 
police assuming much of the responsibility for monitoring the conduct of 
out-prisoners, probation officers could devote energy to preventing individuals 
from entering the criminal justice system. One good way to start would be by 
helping to keep 8,600 Los Angeles junior high students -- the number that 
dropped out last year -- in school. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters identified by police, school officials and other agencies as "at 
risk" could be referred to probation personnel for counseling, training and 
other preventive measures. In other words, we can shift the focus of a powerful 
force toward the prevention of crime and diversion of our youth from criminal 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
Combining this considerable resource with educational and other social service 
providers in a coordinated effort could keep kids out of the justice system, 
reduce the school dropout rate, provide greater parental responsibility and 
control and improve the chances of many at-risk kids to share in the benefits 
of this wonderful country of which they are a part.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN WAITING IN CAR IS SHOT TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 28-year-old man was shot to death as he waited for friends outside a North 
Hollywood convenience store, Los Angeles police reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Octaviano Robles Hernandez was shot about 11:45 p.m. Saturday as he sat in the 
back seat of a car in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven store at Vanowen Street and 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Lt. Stuart Maislin said. He said there was no apparent 
reason for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez died after being taken to Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills. His 
attackers, whom witnesses described as two or three males ages 17 to 20, fled 
in a brown station wagon, Maislin said. They were accompanied by a teen-age 
girl, he said.

CHALLENGES TO PROPOSITION 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We moved here just after the passage of Prop. 13 and bought a home in Los 
Angeles. I was amazed that nobody seemed to realize that the new tax break for 
homeowners discriminated against us new owners. 
</P>
<P>
But then, who cared about new buyers -- buying at inflated prices -- as long as 
the original settlers kept their status quo. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the tax rate should stay at 1%, but all property should be appraised 
equally. I cannot understand why it should be such an issue. Equality is so 
easy to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
For those financially strapped senior citizens who would find it difficult to 
pay a fair share of the taxes, there is a state program which permits them to 
withhold all property taxes until the house is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Since my tax base is different from that of people who purchased their homes 
before 1978, I feel that we are being discriminated against -- most unfairly.

LIMITED SERVICE MAKES SENSE FOR DEL MAR DEPOT; 
</P>
<P>
TRAINS: THERE IS A FEELING THAT THE STATION IS BEING UNMERCIFULLY RIPPED OUT OF 
THE FRAMEWORK OF THE COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL RAIL DESTINATION FOR 
ALMOST 100 YEARS. BUT CITY OFFICIALS, MERCHANTS AND RESIDENTS BELIEVE LIMITED 
SERVICE IS POSSIBLE AND WOULD BENEFIT NOT ONLY DEL MAR, BUT ALL OF SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA. 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FRANKEL, Paul Frankel is the owner of Kirby's Cafe in Del Mar and a 
member of the Del Mar Mayor's Amtrak Task Force. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the selection of Solana Beach as a stop on the proposed North County 
commuter rail line, government planners and transportation officials seem more 
determined than ever to eliminate Amtrak service from Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The North County Transit District, the San Diego Assn. of Governments and the 
Los Angeles/San Diego Rail Corridor Agency consider the Del Mar station 
inadequate for commuter rail needs, and the combination of Amtrak and commuter 
service in Solana Beach the way to maximize efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally in Del Mar, there is a feeling that the station is being unmercifully 
ripped out of the framework of the community that has been a successful rail 
destination for almost 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar has had rail service since its origin. The railroad right-of-way was 
deeded by the South Coast Land Co. (original developers of Del Mar) to what is 
now the Santa Fe Railway, and, according to local legend, the railway promised 
that railroads would always service Del Mar, although written records of that 
have not been found. 
</P>
<P>
People all up and down the Southern California coast come to Del Mar by train, 
especially during the horse-racing season. And many residents can walk to the 
station, giving them easy access to the whole Amtrak system. 
</P>
<P>
So Del Mar is concerned about losing the identity and, perhaps, even the heart 
and soul of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants are also concerned about how the loss of pedestrian and tourist 
traffic will affect their businesses. Without a train stop, visitors will most 
likely arrive by car. Since Del Mar already has too little parking, a community 
known for its pedestrian-oriented charm could quickly turn into one clogged 
with traffic, much like Sausalito. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar is well aware that the station has limitations that prevent it from 
being able to support full Amtrak service. But the solution doesn't have to be 
closure. City officials, merchants and residents believe limited Amtrak service 
is possible and would benefit not only Del Mar, but all of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of limited use is not new to Amtrak or to the Los Angeles/San Diego 
Rail Corridor Agency (Lossan). Trains stop in San Clemente only twice in the 
morning and once in the afternoon. The San Clemente station has no dedicated 
parking, and passengers purchase their tickets on the train with no penalty. 
Amtrak has served San Clemente this way for many years. And, although Lossan, 
Sandag and NCTD maintain that limited use is confusing to rail passengers, San 
Clemente city officials say the arrangement has not been a problem. 
Furthermore, the concept of local and express trains is widely used across the 
country, proving that passengers can understand differing schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Limited service would be even easier at the Del Mar station, which has more 
than 90 dedicated parking spaces plus 128 adjacent spaces, most of them unused 
during weekday peak travel times. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly these spaces could support more than the three stops in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Other limitations of the Del Mar station can be eliminated. The city plans to 
improve access to the station this year and add a much-needed sidewalk. The 
platform also needs to be lengthened and raised for handicapped access. 
Adequate land is available north of the station to allow the expansion needed 
for trains to visit the station without blocking the nearby intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Funds for these projects would be available if Sandag would abandon its recent, 
unrealistic proposal to add a seasonal platform near the exercise track at the 
fairgrounds. Sandag itself rejected the concept just a year ago and its own 
consultant has advised against it since riders would most likely still need to 
be shuttled to the grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
With a longer platform, handicapped access, existing parking and the 
improvements being made by the city, there is no reason why limited service 
should not be possible at Del Mar once the Solana Beach station opens, in late 
1992 or early 1993. 
</P>
<P>
And keeping the station could benefit Amtrak as well. Opponents of limited 
service fail to take into account how the loss of the Del Mar destination will 
affect ridership. 
</P>
<P>
One overall fact remains: Del Mar is one of only three stops on the Amtrak line 
(San Clemente and Santa Barbara are the others) where riders can step off the 
train and be literally just a few feet from the beach, a fact regularly 
publicized in Amtrak promotional literature. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar does welcome the Solana Beach station. But Amtrak, Lossan, NCTD and 
Sandag have a responsibility to provide a rail system that serves all rail 
riders in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Two stations, a full-service one in Solana Beach and a limited-service one in 
Del Mar, would do that better than one.

FLEXIBILITY FOR CONVENTIONAL CUTS; 
</P>
<P>
EUROPE: EAST AND WEST ARE RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING MILITARY ISSUES 
FROM INTERFERING WITH POLITICAL CHANGE, OR NEW SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. HUNTER, Robert E. Hunter is vice president for regional programs 
and director of European studies at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bonhomie of the Malta meeting between George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev 
underscored one key development of the new detente: Confrontation between the 
Atlantic Alliance and the Warsaw Pact has effectively come to an end. But that 
fact also contains an imperative to close the gap between decisive political 
change and the persistence of the old military structures. 
</P>
<P>
Most striking, the Warsaw Pact has ceased to be a viable military alliance, 
although nearly 400,000 Soviet troops remain in East Germany. Lines of 
communication between the Soviet Union and Germany are no longer guaranteed, 
and the pact's political basis has collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, NATO's political cohesion sustains its military capacities. But 
its doctrines are being hollowed out. Most obviously, the role of nuclear arms 
in NATO strategy is under challenge. As recently as last May, for example, the 
United States and Britain were pressing West Germany to accept deployment of a 
new short-range nuclear missile. But when the Berlin Wall opened, that became 
impossible. No government in Bonn can agree to target democratic countries, 
actual and incipient, with nuclear weapons. Indeed, it would probably accede to 
a renewed Soviet proposal to denuclearize both Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear element in Western strategy will not, in fact, be abandoned anytime 
soon. But from now on there will be little willingness within the alliance to 
deal with any of the requirements of making credible NATO's doctrine of 
"flexible response" -- the process of escalating, if need be, to nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
Two other changes must also be recognized. Efforts to rationalize and modernize 
NATO defenses will proceed at a much slower pace, if at all. And U.S. efforts 
to get the Europeans to assume a greater share of the common defense burden 
will now fall on ears even less willing to hear. Indeed, now that the United 
States is committed to making significant cuts in its forces deployed in 
Europe, the debate will shift to a competition among the allies to benefit from 
any reductions agreed at the Vienna talks on conventional forces. 
</P>
<P>
Given these pressures, President Bush is wise to press for an early conclusion 
of the conventional force talks. An agreement would also begin getting Soviet 
troops out of Eastern Europe, where their presence still poses a latent threat 
to the West and is a potentially explosive factor in a region ablaze with 
democratic revolution. 
</P>
<P>
But as now designed, the Vienna talks are deficient. When convened, they were 
predicated on the need to regulate the potential for conflict. Because distrust 
formed the political background, great emphasis has been put on elaborate 
mechanisms for ensuring that everyone's interests are protected. Following an 
agreement, these new military arrangements would be frozen in time and space. 
So, presumably, would be East-West politics. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, however, the states of East and West have begun to realize 
that they share a new set of interests that are not based on confrontation but 
on common security. They are coming to recognize the importance of keeping 
military issues from interfering with political change, or from later on 
inhibiting the development of new security arrangements embracing the entire 
Continent. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, therefore, the Vienna talks should not be directed toward creating an 
inflexible agreement but rather toward helping both alliances coordinate 
mutual, unilateral reductions in troops and weapons. This method would dispense 
with elaborate zones and ceilings on forces that impose unwanted rigidities -- 
especially, in the West, on the U.S. presence on the Continent. Each alliance 
could structure its remaining forces as it saw fit -- mindful that the other 
alliance would not continue its own cuts unless the process were satisfactory. 
Most important, there would be no new and cumbersome military arrangements in 
the way of the eventual creation of an all-European security system. 
</P>
<P>
Even this more flexible approach to reducing conventional forces in Europe 
would not answer the most critical question: How to proceed with the politics 
of unifying both Europe and Germany while security is based on opposing 
military machines. One Germany cannot be in two alliances or be neutral between 
them so long as they form the basis of European security. Nor can it belong to 
NATO, as President Bush has asserted. Thus the job of both devising and 
developing an alternative for European security -- from the Atlantic to the 
Urals -- cannot be postponed. It must begin now, before either "history in the 
streets" or political strife between West Germany and its neighbors over 
unification clashes with the remnants of East-West military confrontation.

IT'S OUR MONSTER THREATENING DEMOCRACY; 
</P>
<P>
PHILIPPINES: AMERICAN FIGHTERS HELPED SAVED PRESIDENT AQUINO, BUT U.S. POLICIES 
HAVE ALSO UNDERMINED THE CIVILIAN- MILITARY RELATIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER TARR, Peter Tarr, a New York journalist, has covered the Philippines 
for seven years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American F-4 fighters screamed low over Manila the afternoon of Dec. 2 in a 
demonstration of support for the democratically elected government of 
Philippine President Corazon Aquino. The show of strength may well have been 
the decisive factor in keeping her in power, at least for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the "unprecedented" American intervention, the military faction 
loyal to Aquino did seem to turn the tide against the rebels. Predictably, U.S. 
government officials quickly congratulated themselves for having moved swiftly, 
yet with restraint, to bolster a trusted friend in her hour of need. 
</P>
<P>
Several days later, though, when "mopping-up operations" carried out by 
Aquino's troops had failed to quell street fighting in Makati, Manila's 
financial district, U.S. officials were pushing a different line. No longer did 
they describe the American F-4s as decisive. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not very involved . . . in terms of our resources," backtracked Pete 
Williams, a Defense Department spokesman, as fighting moved into its fifth day. 
"This is essentially a fight that (the Filipinos) are carrying out," said 
Richard A. Boucher, a State Department official. 
</P>
<P>
Such American disclaimers are depressingly familiar to students of the postwar, 
post-colonial "special relationship" between the two countries. When things are 
going well in the Philippines, U.S. officials eagerly claim their share of the 
credit. But when events turn unpleasant, the official talk tends to dwell on 
America's "limited leverage" in the distant archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
This inconsistency of American rhetoric is central to the pathology of 
Philippine-American relations. In 1981, George Bush saw fit to proclaim 
America's "love" for Ferdinand E. Marcos because of his "adherence to 
democratic processes and principles." Not that many years later, Marcos was the 
evil dictator, a man who had oppressed his people and was thus unworthy of 
American support. 
</P>
<P>
The "special relationship" was not as special as it was presumed to be. The 
U.S. government would indulge Marcos the dictator while he was able to maintain 
domestic order, thereby promoting American interests in the Philippines. When 
his control slipped, he was expendable. 
</P>
<P>
American attitudes toward the sixth attempt to oust his successor further 
demonstrate the conditionality of "special relations." Extraordinary actions to 
support Aquino will be taken so long as she seems able to hold things together. 
But if the center begins to unravel, expect the United States to distance 
itself from the Aquino government or even to give its support to a faction or 
leader it perceives to be a more reliable defender of its interests. 
</P>
<P>
The great irony, of course, is that when Philippine soldiers attempt to seize 
the government by force, they do so with weapons made in the U.S.A. Their guns, 
ammunition, armored vehicles and airplanes are legacies of American "security 
assistance" to a succession of Philippine governments. During the martial-law 
years, 1972-1981, the Philippine military grew from a modest force of 50,000 to 
one five times as large. This expansion was underwritten by the United States, 
in the interests of helping Marcos combat a communist insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Philippine army has proved remarkably ineffective as a 
counterinsurgent force, it has become quite adept at intervening in the affairs 
of civilian government. From the very outset of her presidency, Aquino has been 
a virtual prisoner of the soldiers sworn to protect and defend her. The 
longstanding deference of the armed forces to civilian authority was abandoned 
during the military expansion of the Marcos years; it will be extremely 
difficult for any Philippine president to restore. 
</P>
<P>
If Aquino's troubles continue and her support in the United States begins to 
evaporate, we would do well to ask ourselves whether any centrist Philippine 
leader, committed to the democratic process, would fare any better. Aquino's 
shortcomings are plainly evident. But even as we criticize her, we should, in 
fairness, consider our role in the creation of the military monster that 
threatens to overwhelm not just Mrs. Aquino but also the democracy it is 
empowered to defend.

MARATHON: ERNESTO BEATRIZ MARTINEZ OF MEXICO CITY, TRAVELED A LONG ROAD TO THE

<P>
While more than a thousand runners were treated to an evening of comedy, music 
and magic at Saturday night's carbo load dinner on Mission Bay, Ernesto Beatriz 
Martinez of Mexico City was treated to a bumpy 12 1/2-hour bus ride from his 
hometown to border town Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Not until early Sunday morning did Beatriz Martinez, 29, cross the U.S./Mexican 
border to register for, then reach the starting line of, the San Diego 
International Marathon on East Mission Bay Drive. 
</P>
<P>
His recovery was simply amazing. Two hours, 16 minutes and 12 seconds later, in 
only his second marathon -- his first was this event last year when he finished 
eighth -- Beatriz Martinez crossed the finish line 39 seconds ahead of South 
African Mark Plaatjes, now of Lake Forest, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't 100% sure I'd win," he said through an interpreter, "but I had much 
confidence that I'd do well. I was well prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Marie Rollins, a member of the 1988 Irish Olympic team and now of Glendale, 
kicked her race up a gear after the 16th mile and won the women's race in 
2:39:05, handily defeating hometown favorite Mindy Ireland (2:42:18) of 
Escondido. It was the first marathon Rollins has completed this year, after 
dropping out of the New York City Marathon four weeks ago in mile 18 because of 
stomach cramps. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing was to feel the best I could," said Rollins, 30. "I went out 
real conservative, I ran my own race and it paid off." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it did. Beatriz Martinez and Rollins received $5,000 each for their 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
And for Beatriz Martinez, who ran cross country for San Diego City College in 
1988, he might as well have won the lottery. This was a man who earlier this 
week was running in tattered shoes and had a TV raffled in his honor to raise 
the $180 required to cover transportation, the entrance fee and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to help my family and friends who raised the money for me," said 
Beatriz Martinez, a school teacher in Mexico City. "My family, they are very 
poor." 
</P>
<P>
Plaatjes and Ireland took home $2,500 each, and Maurilio Castillo (2:18:06) of 
Naucalpan, Mexico, the men's third place finisher, and Great Britian's Gillian 
Horovitz (2:43:20), now of New York City, third in the women's race, received 
$1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Kurtis of Detroit was successful in his bid to run his 12th marathon in a 
calendar year under 2 hours, 20 minutes. His 2:18:16 finish set a world record. 
Kurtis was originally awarded third place, but miscommunication somewhere along 
the 26.2-mile course gave Castillo third in his first marathon and moved Kurtis 
to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo was entered in the accompanying half marathon, but he and Pedro 
Casillas missed that races' turn at just over the mile mark and mistakenly 
followed the longer route. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Bill Burke, co-owner of the marathon, Castillo was told 
several times that he was running the marathon course, but he decided to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I traveled too much to get here to go home and say I went the wrong way," 
Castillo said, also using an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
There was some question that Castillo hadn't finished the entire race as 
reporters and photographers on the lead vehicle didn't see him for several 
miles. But Plaatjes said it was because he and Casillas, who eventually dropped 
out at mile 18, were so far ahead of the lead pack of Plaatjes, Danny Bustos, 
Dick LeDoux, Kurtis and Leodigard Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw them way ahead of us," said Plaatjes. "I told them (Bustos, LeDoux and 
Martin) not to worry about me, I'm not racing, but they better go catch the 
other guys. The first time we caught them was at 18 miles." 
</P>
<P>
Said Burke: "My position is that he paid the same fee, he ran the same race and 
he finished the race." Although the city didn't allow any vehicles on the 
course from miles 18-22, Burke said cameras would verify that he did cover the 
complete distance. 
</P>
<P>
Bustos of Las Vegas, N.M., led for the first 14 miles, followed closely by 
Plaatjes, Beatriz Martinez and LeDoux. But Beatriz Martinez took the lead at 23 
miles and Plaatjes couldn't close the gap. 
</P>
<P>
Rollins and Ireland ran together for 11 miles until Kathy Smith of Irvine took 
the lead for miles 12-17. Rollins reeled Smith in gradually and took the lead 
for the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
Marathon Notes 
</P>
<P>
Marie Rollins' time is the fourth best for women in San Diego-area marathon 
history and breaks Chantal Best's 1988 race record of 2:42:22. Best decided 
late Saturday to run the marathon, but dropped out after 18 miles . . . There 
were 6,014 entries for the marathon (3,056) and half marathon (2,958). . . .San 
Diego's Steve McCormack finished sixth, 10 minutes behind fifth place LeDoux, 
with a 2:29:08. . . .Jeffrey Holyfield of San Diego won the men's half marathon 
in 1:07:44, and Katie Webb of Escondido was the women's winner in 1:21:46. . . 
. Bill Fricke of Los Angeles won the wheelchair marathon in 1:55:30 and 
14-year-old Eric Neitzel of San Diego, recent winner of the Mission Bay 25K, 
won the wheelchair half marathon in 1:13:14.

Tony Gwynn's contract, Jack McKeon, Padre manager, vice president/baseball 
operations, said Sunday night, and will not adhere to public pressure. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, continuing to back the guidelines set by Padre owner Joan Kroc, also 
said Sunday that the Padres will not alter their policy of offering contracts 
longer than three years to any player. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a club policy, and that will continue," McKeon said. "There wasn't any 
renegotiations in the past, and there won't be any renegotiations in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"If a player signs a contract, then they have to live up to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, if I renegotiate one contract, I'll have to renegotiate them all. And 
that's just not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, a four-time batting champion, will be the seventh-highest paid player on 
the team in 1990, earning $1 million. His salary rises to $2 million in 1991 
and the club has an option for $2 million in 1992. Yet, even with the salary 
raises beginning in 1991, he still will be paid less than center fielder Joe 
Carter, who was acquired last week by the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Carter, Gwynn will be paid less five other teammates in 1990: first 
baseman Jack Clark ($2 million in 1990), pitcher Bruce Hurst ($1.6 million), 
pitcher Craig Lefferts (three years, $5.3 million), pitcher Eric Show ($1.2 
million) and pitcher Ed Whitson (1.025 million). None of the five players have 
made the All-Star team since joining the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the one who signed it," McKeon said. "He's the one who got the security. 
We're not going to be changing it." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres recently relented in their three-year contract policy when they 
offered Cy Young free-agent reliever Mark Davis a four-year, $12 million 
contract. But when Davis and his agents turned it down, asking for a five-year 
deal, Kroc told McKeon to abandon negotiations, and do whatever it takes to 
fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon went out and signed free-agent reliever Lefferts of the San Francisco 
Giants to a three-year, $5.35 million offer, and while he was at it, finalized 
the Carter trade and signed free-agent left fielder Fred Lynn of the Detroit 
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep hearing all this criticism about losing Mark Davis," McKeon said. "Hey, 
don't blame Mrs. Kroc or anyone else. The fans of San Diego should be proud of 
her efforts. She made him a fabulous offer, and even made an exception to the 
club policy for him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time we ever offered a four-year deal since '83. She offered 
him lifetime security. She even offered to meet him face-to-face two times. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the ones who turned it all down. It's their loss, not ours. 
</P>
<P>
"I totally support her. She made every effort to strengthen the club, and she 
allowed me to make trades and sign free agents worth more than $15 million to 
ensure that the fans of San Diego will be well represented by the ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you be blamed for that?" 
</P>
<P>
Kroc put the club up for sale at the end of the season, and said that 
negotiations are in the final stages. The sale of the club is imminent, she 
said, and is hoping to announce a new owner by the end of the month.

FINAL-QUARTER FAILURE HAUNTS LAKERS IN LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: L. A. IS OUTSCORED, 23-4, IN LAST 6:28 AS IT LOSES TO EXPANSION 
ORLANDO MAGIC, 108-103, THE CLUB'S LATEST TALE OF GAME-ENDING WOES.

ORLANDO, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The small cut over his swollen left eye had long since closed and his 
once-blurred vision had cleared, but Magic Johnson still could not believe what 
he saw and experienced here Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The latest and most complete fourth-quarter collapse of the suddenly struggling 
Lakers, this time against the expansion Orlando Magic, was no illusion, though. 
Johnson had no explanation for the 108-103 loss to his namesakes. It almost was 
beyond his comprehension that it could happen. "We should've won the game," 
said Johnson, who made only three of 16 shots and had 14 points. "We were in 
control. I'm really upset at myself. I shouldn't let this happen. Basically, as 
captain, I have to accept the blame. This loss is my loss." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was not the only Laker to blame, however. Transformed again into the 
world's tallest mannequins, the Lakers stood by and watched the Magic overcome 
a 14-point fourth-quarter deficit to give the Lakers their second straight road 
loss on this eight-game trip. 
</P>
<P>
In what has quickly become a baffling trend in the past two weeks, the Lakers 
(14-5) have played well for about 40 minutes and appeared to be headed to 
victory. Then, rigor mortis grips the offense and Laker leads swiftly 
deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
It happened back on Dec. 1 in a loss to Detroit, when the Lakers blew a 
10-point fourth-quarter lead and failed to score a field goal in the final 
8:02. It happened as recently as Saturday night, when the Lakers squandered a 
late lead against Washington and lost. Even in two of their recent victories, 
over the Clippers and the Phoenix Suns, the Lakers lost leads and had to hold 
on to win. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday night, against the NBA's best expansion team in a decade, the Lakers 
were hit by their worst case of offensive stagnation yet. It was as if, after 
dominating the Magic for more than three quarters, the Lakers fell into one of 
those sinkholes that occasionally envelop locals here. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers led, 99-85, with 6:28 to play, then scored only two more field goals 
the rest of the way. While the Laker offense became a morass of turnovers and 
off-target jump shots in the fourth quarter, the Magic trio of Sam Vincent, 
Terry Catledge and Jerry Reynolds drove past the Lakers defense in a 
game-ending, 23-4 run. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Riley, who said he has tried everything in his power and playbook to keep 
the offense from bogging down, pointedly implied Sunday that the Lakers' 
fourth-quarter failures might be a mental letdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we have to have two offenses," Riley said. "One for the first 40 
minutes when we're moving and driving to the basket, and one for when our 
players get paralyzed, do not move, do not run, can't score and just sit around 
and wait for the game to end. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there's an offense on the planet that can help us." 
</P>
<P>
Riley called it the "worst collapse I've ever seen" from the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
He might be right. Although Orlando has a roster replete with veteran players 
and promising rookies, the Magic is still an expansion team. And the Lakers had 
vowed before this long trip began that they would win all four games against 
the two new expansion teams and the two from last season. 
</P>
<P>
On the final 10 possessions after James Worthy's fast-break dunk gave the 
Lakers a 101-89 lead with 5:15 to play, the Lakers made only one of 11 shots 
and committed two turnovers and a 24-second clock violation. 
</P>
<P>
The lone basket came with 2:47 to play, when Mychal Thompson rebounded the 
second of Johnson's two missed shots and scored from inside. At that point, the 
Lakers still led, 103-97. 
</P>
<P>
But the Magic then finished their 23-4 segment with a final 11-0 run. Included 
in that stretch were layups by Vincent and Nick Anderson, a follow shot to beat 
the shot clock by Catledge and free throws by Mark Acres and Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' problem seems easily explainable. A solution, however, has yet to 
be found. 
</P>
<P>
Teams have consistently double-teammed Johnson and Worthy in the fourth 
quarter, closing off the inside game and forcing the Lakers to make perimeter 
shots. As evidenced by their 39.3% shooting -- 27% in the fourth quarter -- the 
Lakers aren't making many. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cooper and Larry Drew, two outside shooters in a reserve role, combined 
to make only three of 14 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"If this doesn't wake us up, I don't know what will," said Byron Scott, who had 
17 points but was a not a factor in the fourth quarter. "We shouldn't lose 
games, no matter who we play, when we got a 12-point lead in the fourth 
quarter." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although the Lakers lost for the second straight night, they retained first 
place in the Pacific Division because the Portland Trail Blazers (15-6) lost at 
Milwaukee. . . . Magic Johnson was hit above the left eye by a stray elbow from 
Magic center Mark Acres three minutes into the second half. Complaining of 
blurred vision, Johnson left the game for six minutes. He said, however, that 
his vision cleared in the fourth quarter.

ALLEN IS BACK IN AIRBORNE FORM; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: PLAYING FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE OCT. 19, HE KEEPS TEAM IN PLAYOFF 
CONTENTION IN 16-14 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 That old Southern California favorite, the long-grounded Air Marcus, lifted 
off its Coliseum runway once more to keep an appointment with victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Will we ever see Marcus Allen in a Raider uniform here again? 
</P>
<P>
Will we ever see anyone in a Raider uniform here again? 
</P>
<P>
Only Al Davis knows for sure. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, his teammates' selection as most valuable player in four of the past 
five seasons, returned after a nine-week absence to score the Raiders' only 
touchdown. He dived one yard in the 60th minute to beat the Phoenix Cardinals, 
16-14, saving the Raiders' dreams of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite appearances, the Raiders still own the first of the two AFC wild-card 
berths. They've scored two touchdowns in two weeks. They gave up a 90-yard 
touchdown drive in the clutch Sunday to a couple of guys named Hogeboom and 
Sikahema. They were grateful for any help on their last drive -- such as the 
pass interference call against the Cardinals and the offsides by the Cardinals 
blitzers on a key fourth-and-6. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll take anything," said quarterback Steve Beuerlein after a 13-for-30 day. 
"We're just happy to sneak out of there with a win. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a big game in Seattle next week. We've got to get a heck of a lot 
better if we want to have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Early in the fourth period, the Raiders held a 9-7 lead when the Cardinals 
drove 90 yards. There was a 35-yard pass from Gary Hogeboom to Ernie Jones, who 
caught four for 97 yards. Jones was a reserve until J.T. Smith got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
There were eight running plays -- seven up the middle -- for 32 yards. Finally, 
on third-and-goal at the two-yard line, there was a clutch pass from Hogeboom 
to tight end Jay Novacek, a fade pattern on which Novacek outjumped linebacker 
Thomas Benson. 
</P>
<P>
There was 5:10 left. The Raiders hadn't scored a touchdown all day and only a 
touchdown would do now. 
</P>
<P>
Vance Mueller returned the kickoff 49 yards down the left sideline to the 
Cardinals' 46. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders' return game had suffered since Tim Brown was injured in the season 
opener. Mueller was put back there after a recent injury to Timmy Ware. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we were going to kick their guys out on the left side," Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just perfect timing. They kicked them out just as I was hitting the 
thing at a full run. It just opened up. I just tried to get through there as 
fast as I could. The thing just opened up like the sea. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein, however, was still struggling. 
</P>
<P>
The first play of the drive was a routine hitch pass to Willie Gault, to take 
advantage of the Cardinals playing off him, but Beuerlein threw the ball in on 
a bounce. The Coliseum crowd that loved him so recently booed as if he were Jay 
Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders managed a first down at the 36. Moments later on third-and-six, 
Beuerlein threw an out pattern behind Mervyn Fernandez. But the officials 
called pass interference against cornerback Carl Carter. 
</P>
<P>
The replay suggested minimal contact and a minimally catchable pass. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said it "wasn't like it was a blatant call. It was a close play." 
</P>
<P>
Carter took his helmet off, jumped up and down and protested, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad call," Carter said. "Did you see the replay? By the time I got 
there, the ball was through his hands. We had them and then the ref really did 
it to us." 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein then whipped a nine-yard pass to Mike Dyal to the 13. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson went around right end for nine yards to the Phoenix four, vaulting 
four Cardinals on his way. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, on third-and-one from the four, Raider right tackle Bruce 
Wilkerson was called for being offside. 
</P>
<P>
An incomplete pass later, it was fourth-and-six and the nine, with the Raider 
season riding on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals took time out. The teams lined up, and the Cardinals planned a 
blitz up the middle by free safety Lonnie Young and middle linebacker Eric 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and Young both jumped offsides, crashing into the Raider backfield well 
before the ball was snapped. The half-the-distance penalty made it 
fourth-and-one at the four. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, we had it called on 'two,' " Beuerlein said. "They had it timed 
out to come on 'one.' 
</P>
<P>
"Technically, there are supposed to be adjustments made when they blitz, but 
I'll tell you what, in that situation, fourth-and-six, with the whole house 
coming, you'd like to have a little bit more time to think about things and see 
what's going on. It was a big play for us. It gave us an opportunity to go with 
Marcus over the top, instead of having to throw the ball in an obvious passing 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Allen, who had been sidelined for nine weeks because of a torn ligament in his 
right knee suffered Oct. 19, had been in for only a handful of plays Sunday. On 
his first play, he ran onto the field unannounced and received a warm ovation. 
He then caught a nine-yard pass for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
On fourth-and-one, Jackson came out and Allen got the call, as in the old days. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody better in the game going over the top," said Art Shell. "He's 
the best there is going over the top of the defense." 
</P>
<P>
Allen took the ball, leaped and came down at the one for a first down -- and 
got kicked in the groin. He left the game, went to the bench and stretched on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
He stayed there for one play, on which Steve Smith was hurled back at the 
six-inch line. 
</P>
<P>
Allen returned for a last leap that carried him two yards deep into the end 
zone with 50 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been kicked there before," Allen said. "It only lasts for a short time. I 
didn't think they were going to come back with the same play, but I'm glad they 
did. 
</P>
<P>
"I was elated when they called my number, but I just wanted to go out there and 
do the job." 
</P>
<P>
He did. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are 8-6, tied with Miami, a half-game ahead of 7-6-1 Kansas City 
and 7-6-1 Cleveland in the wild-card hunt. The Raiders lead the Dolphins 
because of their better AFC record (6-5 to 6-6). . . . For the first time in 
the four seasons of instant replay, the Raiders lost a touchdown on a review. 
Replay official Bill Swanson ruled that Cardinal running back Vai Sikahema 
failed to control a lateral making his second quarter fumble a muff, and Mike 
Wise's 64-yard touchdown run null and void. Wise had to settle for a mere 
fumble recovery. . . . Art Shell, on his offense: "We've gotten a little rusty. 
We made some throws, we made some reads, we had a little trouble with pass 
protection. It was just one of those days when the quarterback just wasn't in 
sync."

The last time the New York Giants and Denver Broncos got together the sun was 
shining, the temperature was 80 degrees and the NFL championship was on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Everything was different about their meeting Sunday except the result -- a New 
York victory in a steady mountain snowstorm that all but guaranteed they'll be 
back in the playoffs for the first time since that Super Bowl season of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the greatest wins we've had," Coach Bill Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
The score this time was 14-7 as the Giants took a 14-0 halftime lead on a 
three-yard touchdown run by Ottis Anderson and a 57-yard tiptoe scoring run 
through the snow on third and 31 by David Meggett after he caught a screen 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
Then a defense led by Leonard Marshall and Gary Reasons -- with a lot of help 
from the elements -- held John Elway to just one touchdown, a 32-yard 
connection to former Ram Michael Young early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Myron Guyton knocked down a fourth-down pass from the 15 to stop one threat 
with 1:45 left and fended off two desperation passes in the final 15 seconds by 
Elway, who completed 23 of 47 for 292 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows we've got our game together as a team," Reasons said of the Giants, 
who broke a two-game losing streak and are now 10-4, tied with Philadelphia for 
first in the NFC East although the Eagles hold the tiebreaker edge because 
they've beaten New York twice. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys pulled it up this week and worked hard. They showed up ready to 
play. We were never quitters. We've got plenty of heart," added Reasons, who 
had 11 tackles and three assists and stopped Bobby Humphrey for a one-yard loss 
on fourth-and-goal at the 1 in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos are also are 10-4 and need a victory or a loss by Houston to have 
homefield advantage for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos were penalized eight times for 62 yards, including a holding call 
against Gerald Perry that negated a 50-yard run by Bobby Humphrey in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was Denver's second since clinching the division two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Young, a former UCLA player, said: "They played well but we lost the game 
because we had some unfortunate things happen. I think these kinds of things 
may help in the long run. It will get us to concentrate well going into the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants ground their way to a 7-0 lead, consuming almost nine minutes in 
going 85 yards in 15 plays on their first possession with Anderson taking the 
ball in from the three. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Maurice Carthon, normally a blocker, carried the ball four times for 
34 yards on the drive and caught a pass for eight more. 
</P>
<P>
The second touchdown was almost all the work of Meggett, a rookie chosen in the 
fifth round last spring. 
</P>
<P>
First he returned a Mike Horan punt 26 yards to the Denver 36. Then, after a 
penalty and sack had set New York back to a third and 31 on its own 43, Simms 
hit Meggett behind the line of scrimmage near the left sideline. He juggled the 
ball, then cut back across the field and outraced the defense for the score 
that made it 14-0.

CHARGERS LET ANOTHER ONE GET AWAY; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO: REDSKINS COACH JOE GIBBS GETS 100TH NFL VICTORY IN 26-21 COMEBACK 
WIN.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Redskins did what they had to do Sunday, beating the Chargers, 26-21, to 
remain alive in the NFC wild card chase. 
</P>
<P>
"Alive and breathing," said Washington's Joe Gibbs after his 100th NFL victory 
as a head coach. The win gave the Redskins an 8-6 record, the same as Minnesota 
and Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
And the Chargers (4-10) did what they had to do. For the third time this year, 
Coach Dan Henning, a former Gibbs' assistant in Washington, handed the ball to 
rookie quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver and played for next year. 
</P>
<P>
The results were encouraging for the Chargers as long as you didn't ask 
Tolliver, the red head with the rifle arm who has virtually ended Jim McMahon's 
future as a starter with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver completed 24 passes in 39 attempts for 350 yards and two touchdowns. 
He didn't throw an interception or get sacked. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if I complete 40 of 45 passes for 650 yards and 10 touchdowns," 
Tolliver said afterward. "If we lose the football game, it's all for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Tolliver's performance, the Chargers played pretty much the way they 
have all year. They blew a lead (14-0) for the eighth time in their 10 losses. 
They failed to score when they could have won or tied on their last possession 
for the ninth time in 10 weeks. And their special teams were miserable. 
</P>
<P>
Their defense allowed more than 20 points for the first time in almost three 
months. But when rookie Marion Butts bounced an off-tackle play outside for a 
10-yard touchdown run -- his ninth of the year -- the Chargers led, 21-16, with 
8:04 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Butts, whose mother died early in the week, led all rushers with 72 yards in 22 
carries despite having missed most of the week's practice to attend the funeral 
in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
But Joe Howard returned the ensuing kickoff 51 yards to the Charger 39. Only a 
touchdown-saving tackle by cornerback Elvis Patterson prevented a score. 
</P>
<P>
Before Patterson had a chance to completely catch his breath, Redskin 
quarterback Mark Rypien (23 of 39 for 302 yards and two touchdowns) threw a 
33-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Gary Clark that beat a Charger blitz on 
fourth-and-four. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson played the entire second half because starter Sam Seale injured a 
hamstring. "It was a bad play on my part," Patterson said of Clark's score. 
"But I don't know too many people in the league who could stop that play." 
</P>
<P>
Rypien said: "It was a timing thing." 
</P>
<P>
And it regained the lead for Washington at 23-21. 
</P>
<P>
More bad timing arrived for the Chargers moments later when Tolliver and rookie 
center Courtney Hall missed signals in noisy, chilly (36 degrees) RFK Stadium 
and fumbled the snap. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Mann recovered and the last of four Chip Lohmiller field goals, a 28 
yarder, gave the Redskins a five-point lead with less than four minutes 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Which meant the Chargers needed a touchdown, not a field goal, to win. They 
haven't scored four touchdowns in any game this year. And they still haven't. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd think after 99 wins a guy would at least give a guy a break," Henning 
said referring to Gibbs' milestone victory. "Just one little old break." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs' achievement wasn't the only noteworthy one. Washington's Art Monk caught 
nine passes for 81 yards and moved past former Redskin Charley Taylor into the 
No. 3 spot on the NFL's all-time receiving list behind Seattle's Steve Largent 
and Charger assistant Charlie Joiner. 
</P>
<P>
Monk has now caught 651 passes. Monk's teammates, Gary Clark and Ricky Sanders, 
grabbed seven and four passes respectively on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' 45-yard reception after beating Gill Byrd on a crossing pattern came 
with only 15 seconds left in the first half and began the Redskin comeback. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers had jumped out to a two-touchdown lead by scoring on their first 
two possessions -- a 25 yard Tolliver pass to wide receiver Anthony Miller and 
a four-yard pass, in which Tolliver scrambled from the pocket, to rookie Wayne 
Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Miller finished with eight catches for 157 yards. It was the fifth time this 
year he has caught passes for more than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But despite netting 427 yards on offense, their highest total of the year, the 
Chargers lost their fourth straight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say we're getting used to this, but that's what it seems 
like," said Burt Grossman, the Chargers' candid rookie defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
"Same old story line," said Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger defense entered the game ranked fifth in the league in sacks but 
didn't get to Rypien. Grossman said part of the reason was because Washington 
resurrected the old "dash" series with a moving pocket that made Joe Theismann 
so effective in the early 80's. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers rank third behind only Atlanta (3-11) and the Jets (4-10) in the 
race for the top pick in next spring's NFL draft.

NEW ORLEANS: JOURNEYMAN QUARTERBACK LEADS SAINTS TO 22-19 VICTORY.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His journey has been a long and circuitous one through seven cities and three 
football leagues. 
</P>
<P>
But 29-year-old John Fourcade -- formerly of the Memphis Showboats, Toronto 
Argonauts and Denver Dynamite -- finally made it to the big time Sunday and 
responded with a big-time performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around in every league known to man except the European leagues," 
said Fourcade, who led New Orleans to a 22-19 victory over the Buffalo Bills. 
"I was just happy to be out there playing today." 
</P>
<P>
Fourcade, whose only other starts came as the Saints' replacement quarterback 
during the 1987 strike, threw two touchdown passes, and Dalton Hilliard rushed 
for 97 yards and caught a 54-yard touchdown pass. Fourcade started in place of 
Bobby Hebert, whom Fourcade replaced last week. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory, Philadelphia's 20-10 win over Dallas ended the Saints' 
slim playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a good football team," New Orleans linebacker Pat Swilling said. "We 
just won't be going to the playoffs to show it." 
</P>
<P>
The loss was Buffalo's second in a row and third in four games. The Bills (8-6) 
are repeating their swoon of last season, when they lost three of their final 
four regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a horror show," said Bills nose tackle Fred Smerlas. "We've got to 
go out and redeem ourselves if we're going to make the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints (7-7), who gained 436 total yards, took advantage of Buffalo 
turnovers on each of their first two possessions to build a 13-0 lead in the 
first quarter, and take a 16-12 lead after a snowy first half. 
</P>
<P>
The snow disappeared in the second half, but the Saints' defense continued to 
handle the Bills, getting a timely interception midway in the fourth quarter 
that New Orleans eventually turned into the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Toi Cook, beat in the second quarter for a 42-yard touchdown pass caught by 
James Lofton, picked off a tipped ball near the Saints' end zone as Buffalo was 
driving for a go-ahead score. 
</P>
<P>
"The way (Bills' kicker Scott) Norwood was kicking, that would've been a chip 
shot for him," Cook said. "Somebody (Thurman Thomas) tipped the ball and it 
just ended up in my hands." 
</P>
<P>
With Fourcade and Hilliard leading the way, the Saints drove 81 yards to the 
Buffalo four, setting up a 22-yard field goal by Morten Andersen. Brett Maxie 
clinched the victory with New Orleans' third interception of Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of them after what has happened the last couple of weeks," said 
New Orleans Coach Jim Mora, whose team lost their previous two games by a total 
of 10 points. "You have to play pretty good to beat these guys."

PACKERS' MAGIC DISAPPEARS; 
</P>
<P>
KANSAS CITY: CHIEFS LIMIT MAJKOWSKI TO 123 YARDS PASSING IN 21-3 VICTORY.

<P>
Kansas City's defense didn't rest Sunday. The Chiefs were relentless in their 
pursuit of Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski in a 21-3 victory that enhanced 
their playoff hopes with two weeks left in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pretty complete effort. We clicked on offense and the defense was 
tough again," said nose guard Dan Saleaumua, who had six tackles in Kansas 
City's third consecutive win. 
</P>
<P>
While the defense was dominating the Packers, Chief quarterback Steve DeBerg 
was throwing for two touchdowns and completing 15 of 19 passes for 203 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City (7-6-1) scored 14 points in the final minute of the first half -- 
the second touchdown with seven seconds left after a Majkowski fumble -- to 
take a 21-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The defense, which has allowed only four touchdowns in its last six games and 
is ranked second in the NFL, did the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"We accept the challenge of going out there and being able to not allow 
opposing offenses to get into the end zone," Chief defensive back Deron Cherry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City defensive end Neil Smith, who caused and recovered Majkowski's 
fumble, said: "I think the turning point was right before the half when they 
were backed up and we got a fumble on a sack. I beat the tackle and hit his arm 
and then the ball fell straight down and I fell on it. Then the offense scored, 
which is what they have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski was sacked four times and completed 14 of 34 passes for 123 yards as 
the Packers (8-6) fell out of a first-place tie in the NFC Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay managed only four second-half first downs and 208 total yards -- 166 
below its season average. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers' Sterling Sharpe, the NFL's leading receiver going into the game, 
made only one catch for five yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They doubled Sterling and made it tough. That's the best secondary we've 
played all year," Majkowski said. "It was hard to go to my second and third 
reads because the heat was coming. When we got behind, they knew we had to 
throw and that made it tough on our offense." 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg hit Emile Harry with a 12-yard touchdown pass with seven seconds left in 
the first half to give the Chiefs a 21-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Harry's catch came three plays after Smith recovered a fumble by Majkowski at 
the Green Bay 15 with 43 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City had taken a 14-3 lead with 1:01 remaining in the half on Christian 
Okoye's three-yard run, capping a 78-yard drive. During the drive, DeBerg hit 
Stephone Paige for 23 yards, Harry for 18 and then Herman Heard for 27 yards to 
the Green Bay six. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Steve earlier in the week to give his reason for his play," Chief 
Coach Marty Schottenheimer said. "He didn't know. All I know is that he's 
getting the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Okoye, the NFL's leading rusher, finished with 131 yards in 38 carries.

VIKINGS BEAT FALCONS, LEAD DIVISION BY GAME

<P>
Chris Doleman doesn't think it's the least bit rude when a quarterback turns 
his back on him. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in the third quarter Sunday, the Minnesota Viking defensive end came 
around the blind side of Atlanta Falcon quarterback Chris Miller, forcing 
fumbles that were returned for touchdowns by Keith Millard and Tim Newton. The 
Vikings beat the Falcons, 43-17, to move within one victory of their first NFC 
Central title since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Miller) turns his shoulders so much when he's looking downfield, he's 
blind to the pressure," Doleman said. "Most quarterbacks have their head on a 
swivel, and they can sense you. But he's just a young guy. We went into the 
game knowing he is blind to his backside." 
</P>
<P>
Doleman, who is unhappy with his $400,000 contract and is threatening to leave 
Minnesota, had four sacks for 55 yards. He has 18 sacks this season and has 
forced 15 fumbles in his career. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings, 9-5 overall and 7-0 at home, have a one-game lead over Green Bay 
with two weeks to go. Chicago, five-time defending division champion, was 
eliminated Sunday by Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota, which holds the tiebreaker advantage over the Packers, has games 
left at Cleveland and at home against Cincinnati. Green Bay visits Chicago and 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta, 3-11 overall and 0-8 on the road, stayed in position for the 
first-overall draft choice. Although Dallas has the worst record, the Cowboys 
forfeited their top pick when they selected Steve Walsh in last year's 
supplemental draft. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings led, 20-10, at halftime, but Miller threw a 17-yard touchdown pass 
to Shawn Collins on the fourth play of the third quarter to pull the Falcons 
within three points. 
</P>
<P>
D.J. Dozier, playing for the injured Herschel Walker, rushed for 54 yards and 
threw a 19-yard, halfback-option scoring pass to Anthony Carter.

DETROIT: BEARS' COACH IS SUBDUED AFTER BARRY SANDERS LEADS 27-17 VICTORY OVER 
CHICAGO.

<P>
Mike Ditka's post-mortem on his Chicago Bears was quick and almost eerily 
subdued. 
</P>
<P>
"I take the blame for it. It was my fault, and that's it," Ditka said in a 
one-minute meeting with reporters after the Bears lost, 27-17, to the Detroit 
Lions on Sunday, formally ending Chicago's bid for a sixth consecutive NFC 
Central Division title. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared Ditka had resigned himself to the decline of the Bears, who have 
lost four games in a row for the first time since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
There was no shouting about his team's shortcomings, none of the ranting and 
raving that had become a Ditka trademark after some other losses this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the end of the world," Ditka said. "We're going to keep trying, 
hustle, work, practice and try to work this thing out. It's definitely my 
fault. I think we can put a period after that and quote marks and make a lot of 
you people happy." 
</P>
<P>
The Bears were mainly done in by Barry Sanders, who ran for 120 yards and two 
touchdowns, pushing the Lions' winning streak to three. That matches their 
longest since they started 1978 with four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit (5-9) had lost its previous 10 games against the Bears (6-8). 
</P>
<P>
Sanders also won a personal rushing duel against Chicago's Neal Anderson, who 
entered the game as the conference's second-leading rusher, 15 yards behind 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson finished with 42 yards in 12 carries, including a one-yard scoring run 
in the fourth quarter. Sanders' 26 rushes included an 18-yard touchdown in the 
second quarter and a three-yarder that made it 24-10 in the third. He also 
returned a kickoff 43 yards in the second quarter to set up the first of two 
Eddie Murray field goals. 
</P>
<P>
"The main statistic was the one on the scoreboard," Sanders said. "We've 
started to eliminate some of the mistakes and turnovers. When we play well, we 
can beat most teams in the league." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, stopped without a first down on their first three possessions, went 
74 yards for a touchdown on their fourth, scoring on quarterback Bob Gagliano's 
14-yard keeper around the left side.

ESTRADA TO DEFEND WBA TITLE AGAINST SAN DIEGO'S SALUD

<P>
The Forum, better known for basketball and hockey, will present its ninth world 
championship boxing match of the year tonight when Juan Jose (Dinamita) Estrada 
of Tijuana defends his World Boxing Assn. junior featherweight title against 
Jesus Salud of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The bout, scheduled for 12 rounds, twice has been postponed because of a cut 
lip Estrada suffered in training in October. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada (36-7, 30 knockouts) is favored to make a fourth successful defense of 
the title he won on a split decision over Bernardo Pinango last year. Since 
then, he has stopped Takuya Muguruma and Jesus Poll and decisioned Luis 
Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
Salud (31-3, 16 knockouts), the seventh-ranked contender at 122 pounds, was 
born in the Philippines and began his career in Hawaii, where he won his first 
18 fights. He is best known at the Forum for his 10th-round loss to Frankie 
Duarte in a bloody slugfest three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The undercard includes a 12-rounder between Edgar Castro and Manuel Medina for 
the vacant WBA intercontinental super-featherweight title. That bout begins at 
7 p.m. and will be followed by the main event. ALLAN MALAMUD

<P>
Peter Senior shot a three-under-par 69 Sunday for a five-stroke victory in the 
$800,000 Australian Golf tournament, his second consecutive victory and third 
in five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Senior finished with a 276 after four rounds at Royal Melbourne and earned 
$144,000. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman shot a 67 and finished second after Howard Clark of Britain bogeyed 
the final hole. Clark shot a 71 for a 282 total. 
</P>
<P>
Masters champion Nick Faldo of Britain, Frank Nobilo of New Zealand and Bob 
Shearer of Australia tied for fourth at 283. 
</P>
<P>
Senior, an Australian, won the Australian PGA title at Riverside Oaks last 
month, ending a two-year winless streak, and won the Australian Open last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very impressed with him," Norman said. "'Very few people in the world 
could go out and do what he has done. The courses here are a lot tougher than 
in the U.S. He could shoot any number around the courses there, and it will be 
interesting to see what he does." 
</P>
<P>
Senior began the final day with a three-shot lead over defending champion 
Rodger Davis of Australia, who shot a 75. 
</P>
<P>
Senior birdied the the second, third and sixth holes on the 6,977-yard Royal 
Melbourne course. He gave back two strokes at the ninth and 11th but had 
birdies at 12 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
"I did what I set out to do early on, make a couple of birdies and hang on to 
it," he said. "No one was making a charge, but it was still difficult out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Nobuo Serizawa shot a 2-under-par 70 and beat David Ishii of the United States 
by four strokes in the $570,000 Daikyo Open at Onnason, the final event on the 
1989 Japan PGA tour. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first victory this season for the 30-year-old Serizawa, who finished 
with a 271 and won $102,000.

FRANKLY PERFECT WINS $500,000 TURF CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only a few days after actor Sylvester Stallone bought 25% of three horses owned 
by King owner Bruce McNall, one of them, Frankly Perfect, won by 2 1/4 lengths 
in the $500,000 Hollywood Turf Cup before a crowd of 21,550 at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly Perfect wasn't favored Sunday, but Stallone talked in the winner's 
circle as though he was working from a script. He acted totally unlike a man 
making his first visit to a race track. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing like starting in the penthouse," Stallone said. "I can see where this 
sport could be very addictive." 
</P>
<P>
Stallone knows horses, but the kind he's been exposed to have been polo ponies, 
which he rides and breeds. "The kind of horses I have, even I can catch them," 
Stallone said. 
</P>
<P>
When Chris McCarron, who was winning his third Turf Cup, and Frankly Perfect 
made their move from third place to the lead on the final turn, there was no 
catching the Perrault-Franca 4-year-old colt, who is also owned in part by the 
Kings' Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee Affair, the favorite by 10 cents over Frankly Perfect, finished second 
for the sixth time this year, beating Pleasant Variety by three-quarters of a 
length. Live the Dream, the Hollywood Derby winner, ran fourth, another two 
lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
Like Yankee Affair, Frankly Perfect had spent a lot of time running second. 
Before Sunday, the Charlie Whittingham trainee had won only two of eight starts 
this year and was the runner-up four times, three of them in major races. 
Paying $7.60 to win and running 1 1/2 miles in 2:26 3/5, Frankly Perfect won 
for the first time since the Golden Gate Handicap six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
He had made only two starts since then, and was scratched the morning of the 
Arlington Million in September because he caught a virus in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, who trained Perrault, the national male grass champion in 1982, 
won the first Turf Cup, with Providential II, in 1981, but had two seconds and 
three thirds in the stake since then. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Chris to lay close (Sunday), because there wasn't a lot of speed in the 
race," Whittingham said. "This horse has good foot, so he's the kind you can 
place anywhere. He's going to get better, and could be the kind of horse who 
might really be something next year." 
</P>
<P>
Caltech, who accounted for one of Yankee Affair's many seconds when he won the 
Budweiser International at Laurel in October, set a dawdling early pace in the 
Turf Cup. Star Lift, the third-place finisher in the Breeders' Cup Turf at 
Gulfstream Park, was a close second down the backstretch. Frankly Perfect and 
Yankee Affair were slightly behind the leaders all the way. 
</P>
<P>
On the race's final turn, Star Lift dropped out of contention, eventually 
finishing ahead of only one runner in the l0-horse field, and Frankly Perfect 
took McCarron to the front. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron had ridden Frankly Perfect for the first time on Nov. 13, when they 
finished second to Alwuhush in the Burke Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
"My horse was at the top of his game today," McCarron said. "I heard Jose 
(Santos) chirp to his horse (Yankee Affair), but then I saw that his horse 
wasn't responding enough to keep me outside. 
</P>
<P>
"I was clearly on the best horse today. He's been kicking down the barn the 
last two weeks, and he was bucking and squealing in the post parade. Normally, 
he's a big, docile lumbering type. When he worked 1:37 and change (for a mile) 
the other day, you knew he was ready." 
</P>
<P>
Frankly Perfect earned $275,000, sending his career total over the $1-million 
mark. Yankee Affair went over $2 million by winning $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly Perfect was flying on the turn," said Rene Douglas, who rode Caltech. 
"Chris just had too much horse." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, who rode Star Lift in the Breeders' Cup, the English-bred's 
American debut, saw a Jekyll-Hyde change in the 5-year-old on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"In Florida, this horse was very kind," Stevens said. "A 2-year-old could have 
ridden him. And he warmed up super today. But down the backstretch he tried to 
savage (bite) Caltech. It was like he was trying to put the other horse over 
the rail. My horse was unmanageable all the way." 
</P>
<P>
With the Kings winning in Quebec, Stallone was the only Frankly Perfect owner 
present. The 43-year-old actor became a racing partner of McNall's after 
several conversations at hockey games. 
</P>
<P>
"Our personalities meshed," Stallone said. "I've never even visited the barn 
area and this is the first time I've ever been to a track, so it's like coming 
right out of the convent." 
</P>
<P>
Stallone said that he didn't bet on Frankly Perfect. "I've had boxers, and 
every time I'd bet on them, they never did anything," he said. "So you can say 
that this is the start of a superstition about not betting on my horses." 
</P>
<P>
It was mentioned to Stallone that owning a racing stable isn't cheap. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all right," he said. "It's got to be cheaper than getting married all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron's other Hollywood Turf Cup wins were with John Henry in 1983 and 
Alphabatim in 1986. McCarron, meeting Sylvester Stallone for the first time, 
said that he's a fan of the actor's but doesn't appreciate the Rambo movies. 
"Too much violence," McCarron said. . . Frankly Perfect, whose career began in 
Europe, has a lifetime record of five wins in 19 starts. . . Pleasant Variety 
has won only two of 16 starts this year, but he's earned more than $400,000 
with four second-place finishes and five thirds. 
</P>
<P>
Dominant Dancer hardly seems like a candidate for the $1-million Hollywood 
Futurity next Sunday, but she may be supplemented into the race for $50,000. 
Dominant Dancer, winner of five of eight starts, including the Oak Leaf at 
Santa Anita, was scratched from last week's Hollywood Starlet when Donald 
Dooley, a track veterinarian, ruled on the morning of the race that the filly 
had a sore left shin. On Sunday, Dominant Dancer worked six furlongs in 112 
2/5. "I wanted to work her fast to find out if she was all right," trainer Don 
Harper said. "We sent X-rays of the shin to UC-Davis and they couldn't find 
anything wrong. The vets at Davis felt that we were not risking injury by 
running her." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Hancock, one of the owners of Sunday Silence, said that Goodbye Halo, 
another of his horses, will be sold at auction next month. Goodbye Halo was 
retired after finishing sixth in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, having earned $1.7 
million. "My partner and I considered breeding Goodbye Halo, but we've decided 
on selling her," Hancock said. "She might bring $2-3-million. We could have 
bred her, but lots of things can go wrong doing that, and frankly, I need the 
money. I have six kids to support. Goodbye Halo would be like a diamond, 
perhaps improving in value, but right now I'm a man who can't afford to own a 
diamond." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was a tough day for jockeys at Hollywood Park. Kent Desormeaux was 
unseated in a post parade, and David Flores and Rene Douglas were dumped by 
their horses in consecutive races. Flores came back to win the next race, the 
one in which Douglas hit the ground, with Financial Wizard, a 57-1 shot. The 
only other win for Financial Wizard, a 2-year-old gelding, came at Santa Anita, 
where he went off at 44-1.

HOUSMAN GOES TO HEART OF THE MATTER WITH SENIOR TENNIS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Please forgive Leland Housman for an occasional concentration lapse or an extra 
long break between changeovers. It's not that Housman has a flippant attitude 
toward tennis, it's just that he has more important things on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Housman is a prominent heart surgeon in San Diego County and every now 
and then tennis takes a back seat to saving someone's life. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday, the beepers kept quiet long enough for Housman to put away Jack 
Metalsky, 6-2, 6-3, in the final of the Senior Grand Prix Tennis Tournament at 
the Rancho Bernardo Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Housman, competing in the men's 45 division, used powerful serves and forehands 
to put away Metalsky in just under two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest problem is concentration, but today it was there," Housman said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, though, was a different story. 
</P>
<P>
Housman performed quadruple-bypass surgery at 7 a.m., played the quarterfinal 
match at noon and was back at Mercy Hospital, where he is the chief of cardiac 
surgery. That afternoon he performed a double bypass. 
</P>
<P>
You can understand if Housman feels a little alienated from the tennis crowd 
sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing all that, while everybody else is checking into the hotel and 
waiting to see when their next match is being played," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Housman kept his body and mind in shape enough to win seven 
tournaments this year, which earned him the No. 1 seeding in the Senior Grand 
Prix tournament. Housman's only loss this year came in the La Jolla tournament 
to Bob Duessler. 
</P>
<P>
"This was by far the toughest tournament of the year," said Housman, who 
reached the final here in '87 and the semifinals in '88. "There are no slouches 
in this thing. You're competing against the best in Southern California, not 
just in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Although he abandoned the sport he played in high school and college -- at the 
University of Texas El Paso -- for 15 years, Housman is now able to play almost 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a tennis court at my house and I'm just five minutes from the 
hospital," he said. "Tennis is my out. It's the only way I can relax and get my 
exercise at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Housman said he would never compare the gratification of winning a tennis match 
to completing heart surgery, but he did say the two are not independent of each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"The cross-discipline is very important," Housman said. "The only difference 
is, (tennis) is just a game." 
</P>
<P>
And when Housman loses a game, what is his philosophy? 
</P>
<P>
"I go by what Boris Becker said after he lost at Wimbledon this year: 'Nobody 
got hurt, nobody died, I just lost a tennis match.' " 
</P>
<P>
In other finals, Richard Raverby of Encinitas defeated Bob Robles of Mission 
Viejo, 6-3, 6-3, to win the men's 35s and Christine Putnam of Escondido 
outlasted Debbie McCormick of Huntington Beach, 5-7, 6-1, 7-6, to win the 
women's 35s.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: STANFORD WOMEN RING UP RECORD ROUT OF SDSU, 109-45 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without much size or experience, San Diego State's women's basketball team 
posed little trouble for Stanford, the No. 3-ranked team in the NCAA. The 
Cardinal (3-0), which set one Pac 10 record and three school records, defeated 
SDSU, 109-45, Sunday in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's Katy Steding led six players in double-figure scoring with a 
career-high 27 points. Val Whiting had a career-high 19. The 64-point margin of 
victory was a Stanford record, topping a 57-point victory over Wisconsin last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's 11 three-pointers tied a Pacific-10 single-game record. Steding had 
five of those for another school record. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU (0-6) had just player in double figures scoring -- senior guard Julie 
Evans had 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Miyamoto of San Diego defeated David Bain of Newport Beach, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3, 
to win the Boys' 16 junior championship at the J.P. Yamasaki tournament at 
Santiago Canyon Tennis Club in Orange. Deta Huber of La Jolla won the Girls' 16 
singles and doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners in the second-largest junior tournament in California included, 
Jeff Young of Escondido in the Boys' 14, and San Diego's James Conda and Reggie 
Buenviaje in the Boys' 16 doubles.

METRO CONFERENCE / PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
SWEETWATER PICKED TO WIN TITLE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sweetwater High, with four returning starters from a 25-3 team, is the 
unanimous pick of Metro Conference coaches to win the boys' basketball 
conference again as the 1989-90 season gets under way Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They look really polished," Chula Vista Coach Mike Collins said. "Down the 
road some of us may catch up a little, but we're not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Devils with returning starters Joe McDowell, Carlos Campbell, John 
Gilbert and Melvin Rushing are loaded with quickness and leapers, conducive to 
their full-court pressing style of play. 
</P>
<P>
After Sweetwater, Metro coaches place Chula Vista, Bonita Vista, Southwest and 
Hilltop in a group most likely disrupt the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
None of the existing eight Metro teams has ever won a section basketball 
championship. Since divisional playoffs began two years ago taking the place of 
the 3-A/2-A class structure playoffs, no Metro team has advanced past the 
quarterfinal round. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater, among others, hopes to change that in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
THE RACE 
</P>
<P>
Top contender: Sweetwater (25-3 in 1988-89). 
</P>
<P>
Surprise potential: Chula Vista (13-15), Southwest (21-8), Bonita Vista (5-18), 
Hilltop (11-16). 
</P>
<P>
Hoping for improvement: Castle Park (8-16), Mar Vista (6-19), Montgomery 
(0-20). 
</P>
<P>
Game of the year: Sweetwater at Chula Vista, Feb. 12. Second to last game of 
the season for both teams could determine the championship, if Sweetwater 
hasn't already clinched. The game was to have been played Wednesday but was 
rescheduled because Sweetwater, the county's only year-round high school, is on 
a three-week break. 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
The men: Sweetwater Coach David Ybarra had a brief scare last week when his 
star guards, Joe McDowell and Carlos Campbell, both suffered injuries in the 
first quarter against Mira Mesa. Both injuries -- McDowell hurt his shooting 
(right) wrist and Campbell fell on and strained his lower back -- proved to be 
minor, and they both returned to the game. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell and Campbell are -- by nearly every coaches assessment -- the men to 
watch in the conference. McDowell, a 6-2 senior, is a four-year starter for the 
Red Devils. After five games this year, he is averaging 18.2 points. Campbell, 
a 6-4 senior, is a three-year starter averaging 11.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
This past summer both played in Los Angeles' prestigious Slam 'n' Jam summer 
league. 
</P>
<P>
Who will fill Will Tate's shoes? Will Tate, now a defensive back for San Diego 
State's football team, was a Times All-County first-team selection. In leading 
Southwest to a 21-8 mark, Tate averaged 17.4 points, six assists and five 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
And now that he's gone? "We can't find anybody to fill his shoes," Southwest 
Coach Steve Selland said. "I've tried several guys, but it's going to take 
awhile." 
</P>
<P>
Selland said in the long run one of three sophomores will fill Tate's point 
guard position. They are Darren Davis, Rod Lerma and Joe Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch on offense: Guard John Gilbert, averaging 12.8 points, adds a 
third ingredient to a potent Sweetwater attack. Chula Vista's Shane Howell 
(12.8-point average) and Derek Chapman (10), Montgomery's George Scott (20), 
Mar Vista's Tim Page (13.5) and Tim O'Neal (13) are off to good starts. 
</P>
<P>
Allen McNamee (18), Mike Barnett (17) and Rope Perry (17) give Bonita Vista a 
formidable scoring trio. Aldaberto Silva, if eligible, is a four-year starter 
for Southwest and one of the county's best players. 
</P>
<P>
THE INTANGIBLES 
</P>
<P>
Less is more: For the fifth consecutive year, there is a change in the makeup 
of the Metro Conference. Last year, the conference fielded 10 teams that played 
an unbalanced 14-game season. This year, Coronado and Marian decided to join 
the new Harbor League making the Metro an eight-team league with a 14-game 
symmetrical season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good for (Coronado and Marian), and it's good for us," Castle 
Park Coach Dan Winters said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hilltop Coach Chip Holmes, "I never liked playing Coronado in that gym 
anyway. That was one team I'm glad to see go." 
</P>
<P>
Less is more, Part II: Former Kentucky Coach Adolph Rupp's 1965-66 team 
finished second in the NCAA tournament losing to Texas Western despite its 
tallest starter being 6-5. The team became known as "Rupp's Runts". 
</P>
<P>
Despite its tallest player being 6-4 and the next closest being 6-2, 
Sweetwater's "Diminutive Devils" should challenge for the section's Division I 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I've been here, we haven't been big," McDowell said. "We just have 
to play good defense, get the ball out and run." 
</P>
<P>
Less is unfortunate : Led by Silva, there are a number of talented players who 
will not be playing when league-play begins. Silva, after a long dispute with 
the section over his desire to transfer to Sweetwater, returned to Southwest 
but was declared academically ineligible Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest also lost Laurence Estes, who moved out of the state. Kansas 
transfers Jermayne Montgomery and James Mathews of Montgomery are awaiting word 
on their eligibility from Kendall Webb, the section's commissioner. Under CIF 
rules an out-of-state transfer living with guardians -- as the two are -- must 
be declared hardships or sit out a year. 
</P>
<P>
Mar Vista sophomore Porgie Yokley, a talented Virginia transfer, has decided 
not to play this season. Chula Vista's Louie Zumstein, a Times second-team 
football selection at offensive tackle expected to be recruited by Division I 
schools, has decided to concentrate on working out for football. 
</P>
<P>
Casey June, who would have been a three-year starter at Bonita Vista, is 
playing soccer this year for the defending 3-A champion Barons. 
</P>
<P>
Castle Park's Benji Gil, is eligible, but may or may not play this season to 
concentrate on his studies and baseball.

CHURCH PLEDGES 'LIVING TREE' FUNDS TO FIGHT CHILD ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Every holiday season for the past 16 years, Skyline Wesleyan Church in Lemon 
Grove has produced a spectacular Living Christmas Tree program for thousands, 
raising hundreds of thousands of dollars to promote church-connected causes. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, the 3,400-member parish decided to share that wealth with the 
San Diego community, a move as uncommon as the sum of the gift. Skyline will 
donate almost $200,000 to the Child Abuse Prevention Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The donation is an effort by the church to show the community that "there's a 
church in San Diego that wants to do something for more than just their own 
flock," said Randy Rebold, producer and director of the Living Christmas Tree. 
He hopes other churches and religious institutions will follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
For the Child Abuse Prevention Foundation, which operates on a small budget and 
a full-time staff of five, the no-strings-attached offer was a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
"This mammoth undertaking has renewed my personal conviction that, if people 
are made aware of the need of our abused children, they will respond with an 
outpouring of love and financial support," said Norma Hirsh, foundation board 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the donation will be raised Tuesday night during a $150-a-ticket 
benefit performance in the church's 1,150-seat sanctuary on Skyline Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit may be the last opportunity to catch the Living Christmas Tree 
show. Tickets for 27 shows were sold out six weeks before opening day Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The church does no advertising. The $9 tickets are sold through a mailing list 
of former audience members. 
</P>
<P>
Rebold said the Living Christmas Tree is the largest and most lavish holiday 
production, secular or sacred, in San Diego County. This year, about 30,000 
people will see the performances, which Rebold, a full-time church employee, 
spends a year producing. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all been to church music performances," he said. "There's a reason we 
don't usually go back -- they're just simple. I'm not knocking other churches 
because I've done shows like that too." 
</P>
<P>
Rebold's show could hardly be called simple. More like a cross between 
Disneyland on Parade and the Andy Williams Christmas show, the production 
features a computerized light show, an electrical parade, a dozen costume 
changes, 350 choir members, and, of course, The Tree, with 85 singers from the 
church choir. 
</P>
<P>
Secular Christmas songs take up the first half of the two-hour show, while 
religious classics fill the remaining hour. The church also sells audio and 
videotapes of the show after each performance. 
</P>
<P>
The church has been as enthusiastic about collecting money for its adopted 
charity as it has about planning the Christmas show. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the benefit proceeds, church member Bill Laugaland has collected 
$70,000 in corporate donations for the foundation. And during each performance, 
church fathers pass the plate for the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Skyline's donation will be the first deposit toward a $15-million Comprehensive 
Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Center in San Diego. The foundation is 
working with the county to find a site and secure additional funds for the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
When it is completed within the next five years, the center will be the first 
of its kind in the country, offering children and families a place to receive 
medical and psychological treatment, said Kyle Ciani, associate director. 
</P>
<P>
The goal during a child's 30- to 90-day stay will be to reunite him with his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Now, abused children are placed in foster homes, often many miles from their 
real homes. A child may be placed in North County, for example, though the 
parents live in South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"So it's very hard for a mother to have visitation opportunities, especially if 
she doesn't have transportation. We want to make that a little easier," Ciani 
said. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of the congregation at Skyline Wesleyan Church, that wish may 
come true.

An airliner with 43 people aboard made a safe landing at Ontario International 
Airport after one of its two engines blew up, authorities said. The plane, a 
Trans World Airlines MD-80, had just taken off from Palm Springs Airport when 
the pilot reported hearing a pop in one of the engines, the Federal Aviation 
Administration reported. The pilot decided to continue the 15-minute flight to 
Ontario, which has a longer runway than Palm Springs, said Capt. Richard Mann 
of the Ontario airport's police and fire services.

AIDS GROUP SINGS OPPOSITION TO CATHOLIC CHURCH CONDOM POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For the most part, parishioners at Good Shepherd Roman Catholic Church in 
Beverly Hills hurried into Mass Sunday morning, trying to ignore the Christmas 
carolers singing outside their church. 
</P>
<P>
One woman took the time to call the holiday singers "Pigs!" before entering. 
</P>
<P>
Others grudgingly took the flyers handed to them by carolers, but left them in 
piles near the church doors. 
</P>
<P>
The singers, who included dozens of AIDS activists, were not exactly a welcome 
part of the holiday season. With their songs and signs, they were protesting 
the Roman Catholic Church's stand on safe sex and education about the deadly 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the group targeted Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony's 
recent rejection of the use of condoms to curb the spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The church has traditionally been opposed to any form of artificial birth 
control. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, led in song by a small choir of men with halos -- fashioned 
from metal clothes hangers and gold glitter -- above their heads, had reworked 
the lyrics of traditional Christmas songs to include their own message on safe 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
"Away in the Manger" was revised to "Away With All Danger." The use of condoms 
brings tidings of "Comfort and Joy," according to the lyrics of another song. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated 50 protesters -- who also stopped at three other Los Angeles 
Catholic churches -- did not make much headway at any of the locations. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a trip," parishioner John Steel said of the demonstration after 
leaving Good Shepherd Roman Catholic Church on Santa Monica Boulevard. "I have 
no problem with it, though. They are guaranteed their free speech. They can do 
what they want." 
</P>
<P>
The protest was organized by members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or 
ACT-UP. Members lined up on a grassy strip in front of the church and handed 
out flyers labled "Mahony-Baloney" and "Lies-Murder." There were picket signs 
decrying Mahony and church policy. Free condoms were also offered to 
parishioners going to Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really listening to what they say -- in fact, I don't think most of 
the people here pay attention to it," Steel said of the protesters. "I don't 
think if they had 1,000 protesters out here it would make much difference." 
</P>
<P>
"If they have a problem, they can say what they want," another parishioner, 
Gina Aloisi, said of the demonstrators. "But I don't have a problem with my 
church. I took their paper but I don't agree." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Moshay left 10:30 a.m. Mass and got into a short, but loud, debate with 
the protesters. He saw a caricature of Mahony on a sign that had the word 
"Guilty" stamped on it. 
</P>
<P>
"What's he guilty of, free speech?" Moshay asked. "You say what you want and we 
can say what we want." 
</P>
<P>
He was quickly shouted down by several protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"God bless you all," he called back, then dropped out of the battle. But with a 
smile on his face he continued to watch the gathering in front of his church. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw those signs and wanted to say something," he said later. "Why should 
Mahony be censored and not them? They have no right to shut him up just as we 
have no right to shut them up." 
</P>
<P>
Helene Schpak, a spokeswoman for the demonstrators, said Mahony drew most of 
the protesters' ire because of his condemnation of the use of condoms to avoid 
AIDS and declaration that the concept of safe sex is a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very angry with him," she said. "His statements are what really spurred 
our energy to do this today." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters also sang and demonstrated at St. Francis of Assisi Roman 
Catholic Church in the Silver Lake district, Our Lady Queen of Angels Roman 
Catholic Church downtown, and Blessed Sacrament Roman Catholic Church in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The peaceful demonstrations here contrasted with a much larger, confrontational 
protest in New York, where about 4,500 gay rights activists swarmed in front of 
St. Patrick's Cathedral and disrupted Mass when many shackled themselves to 
pews. Police arrested about 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
Only one minor disturbance occurred in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At Good Shepherd Roman Catholic Church, an ACT-UP member claimed he was punched 
in the stomach by a parishioner. Beverly Hills police investigated, but took no 
action after determining that the protester had merely been abruptly brushed 
aside by a churchgoer. 
</P>
<P>
At the 12:15 p.m. Mass, the songs of the carolers outside could just barely be 
heard on the other side of the church's thick wooden doors. During his sermon, 
Father Herbert de Souza said: "There will be people waiting outside to see you. 
I have one piece of advice. Don't even ignore them." 
</P>
<P>
There was laughter from the pews. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time Mass was over, the protesters had gone.

BATTLE OVER DEVELOPING WETLANDS IS NEARING END; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: A DEVELOPER WHO SHARES APPRECIATION FOR ECOLOGY OFFERS A SOLUTION 
TO PROTRACTED STRUGGLE.

<P>
As winter approaches, the great blue herons and snowy egrets return to the 
Ballona Wetlands, a quiet refuge for wildlife surrounded by some of the most 
intensely developed and valuable real estate in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This tranquil open space between the Westchester Bluffs and Marina del Rey 
offers migratory birds a safe harbor from the frenetic urban landscape next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the peacefulness has belied a pitched behind-the-scenes battle 
between environmentalists determined to save one of the last remaining wetlands 
in Los Angeles County and developers intent on building a massive multi-use 
complex known as Playa Vista. 
</P>
<P>
But now, with a new developer, who apparently shares an appreciation for the 
environmental significance of the land, an end to the protracted battle over 
Ballona Wetlands appears to be at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Although the environmentalists of Friends of Ballona Wetlands and the new 
developer, Maguire Thomas Partners, have yet to sign a formal settlement ending 
a 5-year-old lawsuit, both sides express confidence that a final agreement will 
be reached soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting very close," said Carlyle Hall, attorney for the Friends. "We've 
made very substantial progress on most major issues." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson C. Rising, head of the development team for Maguire Thomas, agreed: 
"Things are moving along very nicely. It does take time. But the spirit in 
which the negotiations are taking place is a very constructive atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of the settlement talks is a commitment by Maguire Thomas to 
save 270 acres of wetlands for the herons, the egrets, and nearly 200 other 
species of birds that call Ballona home at some point each year. 
</P>
<P>
The plans for the wetlands include such public facilities as an $8-million 
nature center with trails and exhibits that would be run by the National 
Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, the vast property west of the San Diego Freeway and south of 
Marina del Rey had been the province of the Summa Corp., founded by the late 
industrialist Howard Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas purchased the 887-acre site from Summa Corp. in February and 
immediately began trying to clear the way for the development of the remaining 
600-plus acres of Playa Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit by the Friends of Ballona Wetlands has been one of the biggest 
impediments to development of Playa Vista. The Los Angeles Superior Court suit 
challenged governmental approvals for the Summa project. Uncertainty created by 
the suit stopped Summa from moving forward with plans to erect a small city of 
high-rise office buildings, as well as commercial and residential structures. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys and officials of the Friends describe a night-and-day difference in 
attitude between Summa and Maguire Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a very different feel and sensitivity to the environment, the 
wetlands and the overall neighborhood," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after Maguire Thomas entered the picture, a new team of 
planners began work on a revised plan that would eliminate the soaring office 
towers, scale back office space to 5 million square feet, reduce the commercial 
space and increase the number of residential units to 11,750. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas also began talks with the Friends aimed at settling the wetlands 
controversy that had stymied Summa. 
</P>
<P>
After months of negotiations, attorneys told a Superior Court judge last 
Tuesday that they are moving toward an agreement. A referee is expected to be 
named to mediate the remaining issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The settlement we are talking about is an excellent one in which everyone will 
benefit," Hall said. "Everybody is moving in the same direction. It is just a 
matter of resolving various points." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides say Maguire Thomas has agreed to save all of the wetland area west 
of Lincoln Boulevard from the base of the Westchester Bluffs north to Ballona 
Creek. The only exception is a swath of land of about 50 acres west of Lincoln 
that lies between Culver and Jefferson boulevards, which will be developed. 
</P>
<P>
The developer will commit $10 million to wetlands restoration. 
</P>
<P>
The National Audubon Society is expected to provide $8 million for the 
interpretive center it plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been wanting to restore this wetland for a long time," said Glenn Olson, 
vice president of the National Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
The nature center's exhibits, Olson said, will explain why wetlands "aren't 
just mosquito breeding grounds or places for shopping carts to rust." 
</P>
<P>
But before the lawsuit can be settled, Maguire Thomas wants certain assurances, 
including a commitment by the 1,500-member Friends organization to support a 
consensus plan for development. Rising stressed that "the lawsuit can't be 
settled" until all parties agree, and that includes the city and county of Los 
Angeles and the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas wants the city, county and commission to agree to process and 
review all plans, environmental documents and requests for zoning approval as 
expeditiously as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The developer also wants to abandon Summa's plans to build an extension of 
Falmouth Avenue through the wetlands. Maguire Thomas' desire not to build the 
roadway has drawn kudos from the Friends but is the subject of negotiations 
with the city and county. 
</P>
<P>
As lawyers and planners debate the future of the wetlands, environmentalists 
continue to educate the public about their importance. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Sunday, Ed Tarvyd, professor of marine biology at Santa Monica 
College, told small groups of bird watchers and interested observers that the 
Ballona Wetlands are "very, very important to wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
Birds migrating from Alaska to South America along the Pacific Flyway use the 
wetlands as a place to stop and feed before moving on. Halibut and northern 
anchovy use the side channels of Ballona Creek for breeding -- "a nursery for 
offshore fishing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40% of the wild bird species found in California have been seen at 
Ballona, the last remaining saltwater wetland between Malibu and Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Farther down the Ballona Creek levee, Loyola Marymount University biology 
instructor Howard Towner had telescopes trained on the egrets and herons. 
</P>
<P>
Towner said the wetlands are home to at least two endangered species of birds 
-- the California least tern and Belding's savannah sparrow. Other endangered 
species such as bald eagles and peregrine falcons have been seen in the area. 
</P>
<P>
PROTECTED WETLANDS 
</P>
<P>
Alongside the proposed Playa Vista housing, office and commercial development 
-- the white area pictured above -- will be about 270 acres of the Ballona 
Wetlands for the nearly 200 bird species that live there. The proposed wildlife 
area is marked by cross-hatch.

NAACP UNIT FACES STRIFE IN WAKE OF RESIGNATION; 
</P>
<P>
CIVIL RIGHTS: CRITICS OF OFFICIAL ARE GLAD HE HAS LEFT HIS POST. IT'S CALLED A 
TIME FOR MENDING FENCES. 
</P>

<P>
Critics of controversial NAACP official Willis Edwards said Sunday they were 
pleased he had resigned, but his supporters praised him for generating national 
interest in the organization's Image Awards honoring blacks in the 
entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards will be succeeded as president of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood chapter 
of the NAACP by Sandra Evers-Manly, who will remain at her post until elections 
are held next year. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been lots of turmoil," Evers-Manly said. "We've got some bridges to 
mend." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards resigned a few days ahead of a scheduled national inquiry by the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People into allegations of his 
mismanagement of the branch's affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're glad he resigned," Connie Watson, a leader of the chapter's dissidents, 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
She was among a group protesting outside the Wiltern Theatre on Saturday night 
during the Image Awards show. Carrying signs such as "What Have You Done For 
Civil Rights Lately?" the pickets did not know that Edwards had already 
announced his resignation in a written statement in the Image Awards program. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards "owes it to us to tell the membership of his decision," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Also disturbing, said Brandy Burton, the branch's former secretary, was that 
Edwards' message was on a page titled "President Emeritus." She said the branch 
"has never had a president emeritus, and it's not clear what powers that leaves 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards on Sunday assailed Watson's comments, saying that she is "not even a 
member of the branch, and hasn't been since August. So she has no say so in the 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
He would not comment further on his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
At the Wiltern on Saturday, Edwards would say only that "I resigned because I 
wanted to resign." 
</P>
<P>
In his written statement, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago I vowed that if the Image Awards would successfully be on 
television for four years and if the Beverly Hills-Hollywood NAACP developed a 
strong bond with the industry, my job was done." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards' supporters said that among his greatest contributions was getting 
broad exposure for the Image Awards show -- nationally televised for the first 
time in 1986 -- and pushing for black talent to play major roles in its 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Television executive Roland McFarland, chairman of the Image Awards show, had 
high praise for Edwards for generating national interest and funding for the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
"Willis has a definite style," McFarland said Sunday. "He's a risk-taker and he 
makes the hard decisions. No one in this nation is recognized by the NAACP 
membership more for his accomplishments at a national level." 
</P>
<P>
Some chapter members, however, had become increasingly critical of Edwards for 
not aggressively fighting for civil rights, not keeping a tight rein on 
finances and, recently, for accepting $25,000 for helping produce last year's 
nationally televised Image Awards show. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's show was managed by the NAACP's national staff for only the second 
time in its 22-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP's executive director, Benjamin L. Hooks, told reporters Saturday 
night that the chapter's management was taken over in October by the national 
organization because "we felt there were problems that had exceeded the 
capacity for the branch to solve." 
</P>
<P>
Hooks called the move a "temporary solution . . . it does not prejudge" the 
matter. An NAACP national panel has scheduled a Dec. 19 hearing in Hollywood on 
the mismanagement allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards' supporters point to his fight to get more blacks in decision-making 
jobs in the industry, including major film studios and television news shows, 
and his success in gaining national exposure for the Image Awards. 
</P>
<P>
But problems continued to plague Edwards. Allegations of financial 
mismanagement surfaced and some said he ran local meetings with an autocratic 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
And last September, Beverly Hills-Hollywood NAACP members voted to demand 
Edwards' resignation for accepting $25,000 from a network for helping produce 
the 1988 Image Awards show. Edwards denied any wrongdoing.

'MIRACLES' MAY LEAVE MORE VICTIMS THAN HEROES

<P>
Having endured more than 21 hours of highly experimental, horrendously 
expensive surgery, little Alyssa Smith has earned the right to join Barney 
Clark, William Schroeder and Baby Fae in the pantheon of modern American 
medical "heroes." 
</P>
<P>
While we all hope for her recovery, we should not forget that there is a real 
question whether the 21-month-old liver transplant recipient and her mother -- 
who donated part of her own liver -- are in reality victims of our love affair 
with modern medical "miracles." 
</P>
<P>
Alyssa Smith is one of an estimated 700 children who are born each year for 
whom a liver transplant may be a life-saving necessity. 
</P>
<P>
Among the serious drawbacks of liver transplantation is the major shortage of 
donor organs. In fact, it is estimated that fully half the children awaiting 
transplants die before surgeons locate an appropriate donor organ. 
</P>
<P>
To overcome this obstacle and, they hope, to increase the operation's chance of 
success, a handful of surgeons around the world have been experimenting with 
using a portion of the liver of a living donor who is related to the child 
needing a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Alyssa Smith's operation was the first such procedure in the United States. The 
surgeons in Chicago who operated on her have, for the past five years, been 
implanting parts of cadaver livers into children. Using this procedure it is 
potentially possible for several children to benefit from the donation of a 
single organ. 
</P>
<P>
As in all transplant procedures, the use of a living, related donor organ is 
preferable to a cadaver organ because rejection is less likely to be a problem, 
and the organ is "fresher" at the time of the transplant. 
</P>
<P>
But the use of living, related donors raises enormous ethical problems. Simply 
put, how can a parent be expected to make an informed, rational, free choice 
when asked to consider donating an organ to his or her own dying child? 
</P>
<P>
Do we really think that Alyssa Smith's mother had any real idea what risks she 
was taking, or that she cared, when it was suggested that she be a donor? Did 
she understand what might happen to her during 17 hours of surgery? Does she 
feel any differently about things now that she has not only donated part of her 
liver, but has also lost her spleen -- because surgeons damaged it accidentally 
and had to remove it? 
</P>
<P>
How do we address the question of whether parents, or siblings, should be 
compelled to donate organs to their children or brothers and sisters? True, no 
one is talking about compelling relatives to donate -- although there have been 
court cases involving unsuccessful attempts to coerce relatives into donating 
bone marrow. But what is the difference between compelling a parent to donate 
an organ and asking that parent? Obviously, only the rare ones would feel that 
they could say no, even if that was what they wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
Even if we feel the problem of free and informed consent can somehow be 
overcome, we are faced with a question of financial fairness and equitable 
distribution of scarce medical resources. 
</P>
<P>
If we were to provide liver transplants to the children who could benefit from 
the operation, we would be paying $210 million to care for 700 children in a 
single year. And given that only about two-thirds of those children will 
survive a year after surgery, we are really paying $210 million to save 461 
children -- or $455,531 per child. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, every child's life is invaluable. Yes, every life is precious. But, yes, I 
am suggesting that certain levels of expenditure are obscene and do a great 
injustice to our concept of social justice. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for a moment, what might be done instead with that $210 million. If 
that money were divided among the 20 states with the highest infant mortality 
rates in the country, each of those states would have about $10 million to 
provide obstetric and pediatric care to women and children at high risk. That 
money could go a long way toward greatly reducing our nation's shamefully high 
infant mortality rate. 
</P>
<P>
Is it right to spend $210 million on high-tech care for 700 little medical 
"heroes," when that same money could save literally thousands of children who 
are dying because they do not receive the most basic medical care?

<P>
Scientists say they have detected a blood cell defect in people with 
Parkinson's disease, a link that could help identify victims before symptoms 
appear. Such timely identification, they say, could open the door for earlier 
treatment of the disease that afflicts 400,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, published in the Annals of Neurology, are the product of 
federally funded research at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson's is a neurological condition characterized by gradually worsening 
tremors, muscle rigidity and weakness -- symptoms blamed on the disappearance 
of key brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists reported finding what appears to be an enzyme deficiency inside 
blood cells of Parkinson's patients, suggesting the disease affects more than 
just the brain cells it kills.

CHILD VIOLENCE INJURES 1 IN 130 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One in every 130 children require hospital care each year for injuries 
resulting from fights, suicide attempts and other intentional acts of violence, 
a study found. 
</P>
<P>
The study, based on Massachusetts data gathered a decade ago, found that such 
harm is relatively common, especially among city dwellers and poor people. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 85% of the intentional injuries resulted from assaults, such as 
fights, rape and battering. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis was conducted by Dr. Bernard Guyer and colleagues from Harvard 
School of Public Health and Boston University School of Medicine. It was 
conducted in 1979 to 1982 in 14 Massachusetts communities and published in the 
New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
One in 42 adolescent boys was treated annually for an assault-related injury, 
usually resulting from a fight. Boys were almost twice as likely as girls to 
seek care for intentional injuries. One exception was suicide attempts, which 
were nearly twice as frequent among girls.

COCAINE SLOWS BLOOD FLOW TO HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tiny amounts of cocaine, smaller than those commonly given by doctors for 
anesthesia, can trigger a significant reduction in the flow of blood to the 
heart, a study shows. 
</P>
<P>
Young, seemingly healthy cocaine abusers sometimes suffer chest pain or heart 
attacks, even though their heart arteries appear normal. Doctors have 
speculated that the drug causes spasms in blood vessels and temporarily chokes 
off the flow of blood to heart muscles. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance of our findings was showing that this indeed happens," said Dr. 
L. David Hillis. The study, conducted by Hillis and his colleagues at the 
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, was published in 
last week's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
In their experiment on 45 people, doctors tested cocaine's effects on the heart 
when volunteers received doses that were about two-thirds the amount used for 
anesthesia. By contrast, people who abuse cocaine typically take six times this 
much. 
</P>
<P>
"Even that small dose caused coronary blood flow to fall by about 15 to 20%," 
Hillis said. 
</P>
<P>
Hillis said that despite the finding, the medical use of cocaine as a 
anesthetic is safe. The volunteers showed no sign in their hearts of ischemia, 
or oxygen starvation.

SHANAHAN OFFERED JOB AT KENTUCKY, NEWSPAPER REPORTS

Mike Shanahan, fired nine weeks ago as head coach of the Raiders, reportedly 
has been offered a five-year contract for $600,000 a year in salary and perks 
to become head coach at the University of Kentucky, according to a newspaper 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky Athletic Director C.M. Newton denied publicly that Shanahan has been 
offered the job, the Denver Post reported. But, the newspaper continued, "It 
has been learned that a five-year offer totaling about $600,000 per year in 
salary and perks is Shanahan's for the taking." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said an official announcement is expected this week. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan, quarterback coach for the Denver Broncos, returned to Denver late 
Saturday from a two-day visit to the Lexington, Ky., campus, during which he 
met with Newton. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by reporters at the Lexington airport, he said: "It was a great day 
for me. I was very impressed. At the same time, no commitment was made by 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how interested he is in the job, Shanahan said: "If it wasn't something I 
was generally interested in, I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't take off with a 
game tomorrow and come down here if I wasn't generally interested in the job."

PACERS FINALLY MAKE THEIR MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HUBBARD, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In most conversations involving the Indiana Pacers, Donnie Walsh does not 
become defensive until it has been pointed out at least three times that the 
Pacers' record over the years is horse manure compared to everything except, 
perhaps, horse manure. 
</P>
<P>
When sufficiently provoked, Walsh, the Pacers' president, will point out that 
it was only three years ago that the Pacers established a franchise record for 
National Basketball Association victories. Only two years ago, the Pacers tied 
the second-best record in franchise history. Those facts are ignored because 
the respective records were 41-41 and 38-44. 
</P>
<P>
"It says a lot about the franchise that 38-44 was the second-best record," 
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it does, but what really irritates Walsh is that before the Pacers began 
the season with 11 victories in 15 games (before Saturday night's game with the 
Minnesota Timberwolves) to lead the tough Central Division, it was assumed they 
would be bad simply because they always had been bad since joining the NBA with 
three other American Basketball Association teams in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
And when Walsh started signing his players to long-term contracts, some 
wondered why a team that had not been better than .500 since playing in the 
same division with the San Diego Conquistadors would want to keep its roster 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
"In a small market," Walsh said, "you have to identify the players you want to 
keep and keep them on a long-term basis or you're going to become a farm team 
for the bigger markets." Besides, Walsh said, the Pacers were relatively 
successful until they lost their center last season. Steve Stipanovich went 
down with a knee injury that eventually ended his career, and the Pacers began 
the year 0-9. They spent the rest of the season tinkering with the roster and 
made significant acquisitions when they traded for LaSalle Thompson and Detlef 
Schrempf and hired Pistons assistant Dick Versace as their head coach. 
</P>
<P>
They did not lose confidence in their nucleus, however. They kept starters 
Chuck Person, Vern Fleming, Reggie Miller and Rik Smits. Then they added bench 
strength in the offseason by signing free agents Mike Sanders and Rickey Green. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a team that looks familiar, but has seven players who were 
not on the roster at the beginning of last season. The Pacers are now fully 
recovered from the loss of Stipanovich, and Walsh has shown faith in the talent 
by giving Person (eight years), Schrempf (10 years) and Thompson (five years) 
new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers, in fact, are good enough to not need help from their No. 1 pick, 
George McCloud, the seventh player taken in the draft. Perhaps by next year, 
McCloud can make a contribution, particularly since the Pacers do not have a 
1990 No. 1 pick. That was because of the last of many horrible trades they 
made, sending the pick to the Mavericks in 1984 for Bill Garnett and Terence 
Stansbury, each of whom is no longer in the league. 
</P>
<P>
But that trade is only mildly bad when compared to the 1981 deal that brought 
Tom Owens to the Pacers and sent the Pacers' 1984 No. 1 pick to the Portland 
Trail Blazers. If they had kept the pick, the Pacers could have drafted Michael 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh God, please," Walsh said. "I don't want to even hear that." 
</P>
<P>
Such trades have contributed to the Pacers' image as losers. And so have the 
last 13 years during which the Pacers have made the playoffs twice and been 
.500 only once. But Walsh, who joined the Pacers in 1986, says judge them not 
by what their inept predecessors did, but what is being done now. And he's 
right -- that's how they should be judged. The anonymous Pacers have quietly 
become a good team. And Walsh says those who have been paying attention are not 
surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Few teams with an ounce of self-respect are elated by losses, but the Los 
Angeles Clippers were absolutely thrilled when they lost to the Los Angeles 
Lakers by only eight points, 111-103, Tuesday. That was the Clippers' 24th 
consecutive loss at the Lakers' Forum, but the Clippers say they benefited from 
the close call. "It gives us more confidence," said guard Ron Harper, who was 
not around for the previous 23 losses. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson patronized the Clippers by saying, "In about 10 to 15 games, when 
they get to know each other and Benoit (Benjamin) gets in shape to play the way 
he's capable of playing, the Clippers will be a tough team." 
</P>
<P>
The absurdity of that statement is the assumption that Benjamin will get in 
shape. The Clippers obviously have assembled some talent, but everything they 
touch turns toxic. They have a bad organization and that makes it impossible to 
have a good team. The Clippers are a couple of lottery picks and a new owner 
away from making the playoffs.

DESORMEAUX DEBUT LACKS TINSEL; 
</P>
<P>
JOCKEY: HOLDER OF RECORD FOR VICTORIES IN A YEAR COMES WEST TO HOLLYWOOD PARK 
FOR A DAY, BUT DOESN'T ADD TO HIS TOTAL OF 564. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux was greeted rather rudely in his California debut at Hollywood 
Park Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
While track announcer Don Alexander was detailing the teen-ager's 
record-setting year and asking the fans to welcome him, Clapper, his mount in 
the first race, spooked, dumped him and embarked on a brief jaunt down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Once collared, the 6-year-old gelding, perhaps nervous about his first start in 
nearly 26 months, was reluctant to let Desormeaux climb back aboard, then 
finally relented. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Clapper wasn't able to increase the jockey's victory total, 
which stands at 564 this year after he collected six at Laurel Saturday, and 
neither could Silent 'N Nasty and Baffo, his other two mounts on the card. 
Silent 'N Nasty finished second in the sixth, beaten by 57-1 shot Financial 
Wizard. 
</P>
<P>
Although his stay was only for the day, Desormeaux, who eclipsed Chris 
McCarron's record of 546 victories Nov. 30, could make this circuit his 
permanent base. 
</P>
<P>
Recent reports from the East had the 19-year-old leaning toward making New York 
his new home, but he indicated Sunday morning that he might be headed this way. 
If he does, he will arrive in late January or early February. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big day for us," he said. "One of the reasons we're here is to see 
what it's like. The weather would be a major factor, definitely, but we have to 
have the feeling from trainers they're going to accept us and use us. 
</P>
<P>
"My agent (Gene Short) is going to go out and meet people and see if they want 
to use us. There are numerous reasons why I'd lean to here, but we have to make 
the best business decision about where we can do better. If we get a good 
feeling from the trainers, we'll come back." 
</P>
<P>
Short said: "One of the main aspects of being an agent is being a good judge of 
character. By talking to (trainers) and meeting them and seeing the expression 
on their faces, I'll be able to tell if they're interested. 
</P>
<P>
"On the telephone, several top trainers seemed very responsive and they said to 
make sure to stop by and see them on Sunday. It felt really good over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel Kent can compete on either coast if the people allow me to accept calls 
on the better horses. If I get a good feeling -- and I think we will -- we'll 
come here because of the weather." 
</P>
<P>
After attending an awards function today and Tuesday in Las Vegas, Desormeaux 
will return to Maryland, then come back to California to ride Ten Keys in the 
$250,000 Bay Meadows Handicap Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he's overtaken McCarron, the Louisiana native's next target is 600. He 
intends to work some overtime in an attempt to reach the figure before New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 600 looks good," he said, adding that he will do double duty some 
nights at the Meadowlands after riding at Laurel during the day. "If we get it, 
it's great, if not, it's just as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The day after the record was set, it was like 20 pounds of stone off my 
shoulders. It was fun to ride again, the pressure was off. I felt like I've 
worked hard to accomplish something, but that it really hasn't sunk in yet."

NEWSWIRE: SWITZER ADMITS GIVING GIFTS TO HOLIEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Oklahoma football Coach Barry Switzer admitted that he gave Jamelle 
Holieway a pigskin briefcase as a graduation present, and that he "probably" 
bought Holieway a beer sometime during the quarterback's years with the 
Sooners, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer said he had received the briefcase as a gift, and that he had given 
away other "freebies" such as shirts to athletes and non-athletes during his 16 
years as the Sooners' head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no telling how many golf bags I've given away to friends," he told The 
Daily Oklahoman in Sunday's editions. "Jamelle is not the only kid I've ever 
given a shirt or a sweater to. Kids that didn't have a shirt, I said 'Here, 
take this one.' But I also gave them to kids who were not athletes." 
</P>
<P>
In a story in The Times on Friday, Holieway said Switzer had bought him drinks 
and given him a leather sports bag. 
</P>
<P>
Switzer said Holieway had seen the briefcase and said he would like to have it. 
Switzer said he had promised it to him if he would get his degree, and said 
that while Holieway is a correspondence course short of graduation, he gave the 
briefcase to him when he left the school earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
An athlete is prohibited from receiving a gift after completion of his 
eligibility if it is in recognition of his athletic accomplishments, but NCAA 
rules provide only that he could no longer participate in athletics. Holieway 
had used up his eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
In reference to Holieway's claim that Switzer bought him drinks, the former 
coach said, "I probably bought him a beer, not a mixed drink, sometime in a 
restaurant in the off-season." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that happened. I've done that for other kids in my years at Oklahoma, 
after a bowl game was over, never during the season and just in a social 
setting. I've bought a beer for cheerleaders before, just trying to be a 
gentleman."

PRAGUE CHEERS A NEW REGIME; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: A CZECHOSLOVAK COALITION GOVERNMENT IS SWORN IN. IT IS CONTROLLED BY 
NON-COMMUNISTS.

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Czechoslovaks poured into Wenceslas Square on Sunday to 
sing and cheer and celebrate the victory of their peaceful revolution as the 
opposition Civic Forum announced it would nominate its leader, playwright 
Vaclav Havel, as the nation's next president. 
</P>
<P>
Havel appears to be the clear favorite to replace hard-line Communist President 
Gustav Husak, who resigned Sunday shortly after swearing in the first 
government in 41 years here that the Communists do not control. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum and its allies in the new government will control economic, labor 
and social welfare policy, the police and foreign policy. Prime Minister Marian 
Calfa and a Communist army general left in charge of defense will be the only 
party members holding major portfolios in the new government. 
</P>
<P>
The minister in charge of the police will be a former dissident just released 
from jail two weeks ago. The foreign minister will be another opposition figure 
who succeeded only a few days ago in having his telephone turned back on after 
security forces had cut it off. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a world turned upside down," said one Western diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Havel announced the new interim government to the crowd gathered to celebrate 
International Human Rights Day in the square, the scene of the massive 
demonstrations over the last three weeks that drove the Communists from the 
power they had monopolized since a coup in February, 1948. The new government 
is expected to lead the country to elections in a matter of months. 
</P>
<P>
A similar crowd, estimated at 100,000 by Czechoslovak state television, turned 
out in Bratislava, the country's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the peaceful revolution, our artificially stopped history suddenly 
has begun to move again," Havel said as the crowd shouted back "To je ono!" (a 
Czech equivalent of "Right on!"), "Svobodne volby!" (Free elections!) and 
"Havel na Hradna!" (Havel to the Castle!), a reference to the home of 
Czechoslovak presidents. 
</P>
<P>
A little over an hour later, Calfa described the government in a lengthy press 
conference. Calfa has had an undistinguished career as a government official, 
but he appeared poised and articulate as he discussed the new government's 
plans and the challenges it faces. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-member government is nominally made up of 10 Communists, seven members 
of the opposition and two members each from the Socialist and People's parties, 
both of which were longtime allies of the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
But of the 10 Communist Party members, two are economic reformers nominated by 
Civic Forum and allied with it. Civic Forum also has formed an alliance with 
the two People's Party representatives, giving it a solid 11-vote majority in 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, four of the remaining Communists in the government are generally 
considered technocrats chosen for their expertise to head ministries in charge 
of trade, telecommunications, energy and mining. 
</P>
<P>
With the new government formed, the crisis stage of Czechoslovakia's revolution 
appears to be over, leaving the more arduous task of consolidating the move to 
democracy. Civic Forum announced it was calling off a general strike set for 
today and asking instead that people throughout the nation ring church bells 
and honk horns for five minutes beginning at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Students, however, announced that their strike, which began the revolution, 
would continue, at least for now, to maintain pressure for a full investigation 
of the police attack on student demonstrators Nov. 17 and to allow students to 
leave Prague to fight attempts to block democratization in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from provincial areas indicate widespread attempts by local Communist 
authorities to hold onto their power, blocking news of events in Prague from 
reaching their regions. 
</P>
<P>
Those reports illustrate the magnitude of what Calfa and Havel both say will be 
the chief task of the new "government of national understanding" -- preparing a 
legal framework to guarantee basic civil liberties and free elections. 
</P>
<P>
The elections, which will be the first free voting here since 1946, are 
expected to be held next spring or early summer. 
</P>
<P>
Calfa, who pledged to act independently from the Communist Party and who 
promised "open doors" to Czechoslovak emigres wishing to return, also said that 
the government would make a start at "radical" economic reforms. The reforms, 
which would alter Czechoslovakia's centrally planned economy but not change it 
fundamentally, are scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But Calfa made clear that the divided government, containing every political 
shading from Communist to ardent free-marketer, would have to postpone major 
decisions on whether to go further and leave such issues to whatever government 
is formed after the elections. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, no decision will be made on legalizing private ownership 
of businesses until after the elections. 
</P>
<P>
A third major challenge will be to rein in the nation's once-omnipresent secret 
police, who have long been a law unto themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In negotiations with Civic Forum leaders, Calfa admitted that despite his long 
career in the legal department of the prime minister's office, he himself does 
not know "where the jurisdiction of the security forces starts and where it 
ends," said a Civic Forum spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing the police "under strict control" is "a priority for us," Calfa said. 
"We have to solve this matter before elections." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rapid democratization Czechoslovakia has seen in the last three 
weeks, the secret police remain active. Diplomats warn, for example, that 
telephone tapping and surveillance appear to have increased in recent days as 
the security forces scramble to keep track of the rapidly changing situation. 
</P>
<P>
The task of controlling the security forces will fall mainly to First Deputy 
Prime Minister Jan Carnogursky, a highly respected lawyer and Roman Catholic 
activist who was jailed for dissident activities in August and released only 
Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Several other new government officials also have been victims of the former 
regime's persecutions. Miroslav Kusy, who will head the government information 
office, was arrested with Carnogursky in August. Valtr Komarek, the new first 
deputy prime minister in charge of economics, was fired from his job in the 
purge following the 1968 Soviet invasion. And the new foreign minister, Jiri 
Dienstbier, has long been harassed for his views. 
</P>
<P>
Calfa, asked about how well he could work with people who had been maltreated 
by a government he long served, offered an apology. 
</P>
<P>
"My feelings are of regret," he said. "I know this will not help Mr. Dienstbier 
now," he added, but "we will be able to cooperate together." 
</P>
<P>
Nor did Calfa deny that the Communist governments of the past bore 
responsibility for the nation's current "difficult" state.

<P>
"We all are responsible," he said, "those who governed in a certain way, and 
those others who respected this type of government or accepted this type of 
government." 
</P>
<P>
The remaining job in restructuring Czechoslovakia's new political order will be 
the election by Parliament of a new president to replace Husak, and Havel 
appears to be a formidable front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker after speaker in the square called on him to take the job, a suggestion 
that met with loud applause from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, himself, did not mention the possibility. Instead, he warned his 
audience that they would have to remain on guard to prevent democracy from 
being subverted. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet won," he said, although the revolution has achieved "great 
success" toward its goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us preserve its purity, its peacefulness, its lovingness, its joyful 
friendly tenor," he said. "Let us ensure its values continue to flourish. Let 
us not permit anybody in any way to mar the beautiful face of our revolution. 
Truth and love must triumph over anger and hate." 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum officials said that Havel had agreed to run for the job, but only 
on the condition that he be allowed to resign after the general election. A new 
president would then be chosen by the newly elected Parliament for the 
customary five-year term. Havel did not rule out running for reelection then. 
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary election must be held within two weeks. And although some 
political figures still oppose Havel, there appear to be few, if any, viable 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists agreed in round-table negotiations Friday that because the prime 
minister is a Communist, the new president will not be. 
</P>
<P>
And there is a general consensus that because Calfa is a Slovak, the president 
should be Czech to maintain the nation's ethnic balance.

DECLINE IN SUPPORT, HAVENS CUTS PALESTINIAN TERRORISM 
</P>

<P>
The radical Palestinian group whose hijackings and gruesome bombings first made 
terrorism a household word in the West has in the past year been virtually shut 
out of its traditional havens in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, according 
to Western and Arab intelligence sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Bloc's opening to the West and reductions in financing from radical 
Arab states like Iraq, Syria and Libya have contributed to the apparent 
breakdown of one of the most infamous Palestinian terrorist organizations. And 
this has forced others to form alliances in Iran with radical Islamic groups in 
order to conduct their activities. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a dramatic decrease in international Palestinian terrorist 
activities this year and a belief among many analysts that the Arab world -- if 
only because of economic shortfalls, outside pressure and simple expediency -- 
has for the moment discarded state-sponsored terrorism as a principal vehicle 
for resolving conflict in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, the failure of the governments who were known to harbor, aid and 
abet terrorists has made them shift their policy," one Arab diplomat said. 
"Terrorism as a way to resist did not produce any positive results for anyone, 
and it triggered a reaction against the governments that harbored them." 
</P>
<P>
An Arab intelligence official said last week there is "confirmed evidence" that 
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadafi has in recent months shut all but three of 
the hundreds of terrorist training camps that once speckled the Libyan 
countryside and eliminated funding for two major Palestinian terrorist 
organizations and a Chadian opposition group. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the official said, Egypt has been notified that notorious Palestinian 
terrorist Abu Nidal has been confined to his residential quarters near Tripoli 
in response to Egyptian demands. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. authorities have been unable to confirm the details, the Libyan 
move, if true, signals an apparent end to the last major financial support 
available from Arab governments for organizations like Abu Nidal's and the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. 
</P>
<P>
These two groups have been responsible for hundreds of bloody attacks over the 
past two decades, including the attack on the Achille Lauro cruise ship and, 
many intelligence officials believe, the bombing last December of a Pan 
American World Airways 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that left 270 dead. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Israeli and U.S. analysts say there is evidence that East Bloc countries 
like Poland, East Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have ceased -- as part of 
their recent openings to the West -- to be used as bases for terrorist 
training. They also are reportedly no longer supplying safehouses, escape 
routes and business protection for terrorist organizations like Abu Nidal's. 
</P>
<P>
"As the world changes so rapidly, particularly in the East Bloc, it's having a 
tremendous impact on some of these groups," said Neil C. Livingston, a 
Georgetown University professor and consultant on terrorism. "Their world is 
shrinking very quickly. . . . It's being constricted to the point that 
primarily these guys are going to be in banana republics soon." 
</P>
<P>
Change in Palestinian radicalism in the Middle East has come from the 
two-year-old uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The mainstream Palestine Liberation Organization, which is directing the 
uprising, or intifada, announced a year ago that it was renouncing terrorism. 
And even the hard-line Arab states, which have been suspicious of any 
negotiations with Israel, are waiting now to see what peace negotiations and 
the uprising itself will produce, a number of Western diplomats and Arab 
leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
"The intifada changed the picture and turned the (occupied) territories into 
the core of the conflict," said Anat Kurz, a terrorism specialist at Tel Aviv 
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies. "The struggle used to be in 
Western Europe. Now it's here, and it's different both in terms of tactics and 
in meaning." 
</P>
<P>
The Jaffee Center, which records incidents of international terrorism, has seen 
a gradual decline in incidents among Palestinian groups in recent years and a 
"dramatic decrease" in 1989. It is a trend that Kurz attributes in part to the 
radical Palestinian groups' apparent inability to maintain Arab government 
backing in the face of strong pressure from the Soviet Union and the West. 
</P>
<P>
Just as important, he said, is the decision of several Arab governments to 
await further political developments before turning again to terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"From the changing of the world situation, everybody is recalculating their 
situations -- even the Israelis. Everybody," said a senior Egyptian official 
who has monitored the drop-off in support for radical Palestinian groups. 
</P>
<P>
While Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak successfully lobbied Kadafi into reining 
in Abu Nidal as a condition for better relations with Egypt, Cairo has not 
drawn down its military guard against Libya, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
"Egypt keeps the same military position as the last six years. We have not 
changed even one soldier," he said. "We are watching. We know through our 
experience with him (Kadafi), he is not a stable man. He can change his 
position from not one day, from one moment to another." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a number of analysts caution that the apparent hiatus in major 
Palestinian terrorist activity could be a temporary phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which is believed to have largely halted its support of terrorist groups 
when its coffers were drained by the war with Iran, could resume its support 
after the economy recovers sufficiently, some analysts said. Likewise, they 
said, Palestinian radicalism could be reignited by the peace process itself in 
reaction to any Palestinian decision to actually negotiate face to face with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, groups like the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command are maintaining strong presences in Lebanon -- with 
Syria's apparent acquiescence -- and have recently established new offices in 
Tehran, according to Western intelligence sources. 
</P>
<P>
The front's leader, Ahmed Jibril, has reportedly bragged about receiving a 
substantial payment from Iran for bringing down the Pan Am 747 over Lockerbie. 
Although the bombing has not been officially attributed to any group, many 
intelligence officials believe that the front carried it out at the request of 
the Iranians, who were seeking vengeance for the shooting down of an Iranian 
airliner by the U.S. cruiser Vincennes. Estimates of the purported payment have 
ranged from $1.3 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Libya had been paying Jibril's organization about $20 million a year, according 
to Western terrorism analysts, and U.S. officials are still not firmly 
convinced that Kadafi has genuinely given up all financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reports that the groups are complaining," said one counterterrorism 
official. "They are not getting as much money, or they have not received money 
promised for a long while. But we can't confirm it." 
</P>
<P>
A variety of European diplomats in Tripoli, however, said in recent interviews 
that Kadafi in the past several months notified a variety of terrorist groups 
of a cutoff in funding, and Arab military officials say Abu Nidal has been 
detained at his residence for nearly two months. 
</P>
<P>
An Arab military source said several of Abu Nidal's lieutenants have sought 
permission in recent weeks to leave Tripoli and go to Lebanon, Bulgaria and 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
But Galia Golan, an Israeli authority on Soviet support to the Palestinian 
movement, said a lucrative business venture by the Abu Nidal organization was 
closed in Poland about a year and a half ago, at the same time the group was 
being pushed out of Syria -- or at least forced further underground. And other 
East Bloc countries are not likely to be as receptive as in the past, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There would appear to be a change in the Soviet attitude toward terrorism," 
especially in terms of increased cooperation with Western intelligence, she 
said. There also have been "indications" of reductions in training and supplies 
to terrorist organizations, as well as some evidence that safehouses and escape 
routes are being cut off, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"When they lose that, I think they will be in trouble. The fact that they're 
losing this kind of logistical assistance is going to be important," Golan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predict that, in addition to Iran, some of the guerrilla and 
terrorist organizations nurtured under the Palestinian flag will begin moving 
increasingly toward Third World dictators far removed from the Middle East as a 
new source of support. 
</P>
<P>
"They can blend into the Third World and find a corrupt regime or two that will 
give them what they need," Georgetown's Livingston suggested. "These guys 
aren't going to spend a lot of time in the temperate zones in the future. They 
will be relegated more and more toward the Equator. That means certain African 
states, Saharan states, Latin American states, maybe Romania for the time 
being, at least." 
</P>
<P>
Kurz, of the Jaffee Center, said there is the possibility that the Soviet 
Union's recent overtures to the West and its apparent pressure on its allies to 
cut back support for terrorism could reflect, in the longer run, the view that 
the Middle East is no longer the powder keg where a global superpower showdown 
is likely to erupt. 
</P>
<P>
"The superpowers have just been disassociating themselves from these conflicts 
. . . and I'm afraid we'll some day soon feel left behind," Kurz conceded. "If 
the Middle East is less a potential source of global explosion, who should be 
interested in several million people who have been fighting between themselves 
for decades?"

'CUSTOMER' POLL SHAPES A CHURCH; 
</P>
<P>
A MINISTER DISCOVERED WHY PEOPLE DON'T ATTEND. HE FOUNDED ONE OF THE NATION'S 
MOST SUCCESSFUL CONGREGATIONS.

<P>
Back in the summer of 1975, an aspiring young minister and a few of his friends 
went door to door throughout the Northwest Chicago suburbs to find out why 
people didn't go to church. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, did we get an earful," recalled the boyish-looking Bill Hybels. "Church 
is boring, church is predictable, church is irrelevant to my life." 
</P>
<P>
And the No. 1 complaint: "The church is always bugging me for money." 
</P>
<P>
Based on his marketing study, Hybels decided to found Willow Creek Community 
Church, a radically different kind of congregation designed to attract 
alienated, "unchurched" people. 
</P>
<P>
Willow Creek is one of a very few churches in the nation shaped by a targeted 
"customer" survey. It is also a huge success: From a modest gathering of 125 
people who first met in a rented movie theater 14 years ago, it has grown to 
its current position as the nation's No. 2 Protestant congregation in terms of 
weekend attendance, second only to an independent Baptist congregation in 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Some church analysts look upon Willow Creek as the prototype for successful 
churches of the 1990s, exemplifying approaches they think will reach an 
increasingly secular and pluralistic society. 
</P>
<P>
Guideposts magazine, a national religious publication, named Willow Creek its 
1989 Church of the Year "for meeting the needs of the 1990s by presenting 
timeless truths in a contemporary way." 
</P>
<P>
Hybels, 37, is rhapsodic about the church's future. "We're on the verge of 
making kingdom history," he proclaims, "doing things a new way for a whole new 
generation." 
</P>
<P>
Willow Creek is cresting a high tide of growth that has swept up most 
evangelical churches -- along with fundamentalist, Pentecostal and some 
sect-like faiths -- during the last two decades. At the same time, mainline 
Protestant denominations have been searching for direction and struggling to 
reverse a downward spiral in membership and finances. 
</P>
<P>
But Willow Creek's unusual evangelism philosophy -- rooted in the marketing 
survey -- its dynamic pastor, and 4,000 true believers and 1,500 lay leaders 
have catapulted the independent congregation to the top. 
</P>
<P>
Espousing traditional orthodox Christianity, Willow Creek's statement of faith 
asserts the need for a personal conversion experience to Jesus as Savior, the 
infallible authority of the Bible, and the obligation of believers to tell 
others about their faith. 
</P>
<P>
But that requires lots of organization. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes almost 1,000 volunteers and staff to produce one weekend service 
here," Hybels told a recent visitor. 
</P>
<P>
The church spends $65,000 a year just for traffic control, paying off-duty 
police to ease cars on and off busy Algonquin Road in this affluent suburb of 
Northwest Chicago. The church parking lot is so huge that signs marked with 
letters and numbers -- airport style -- were installed when members complained 
they couldn't find their cars after services. 
</P>
<P>
And there are so many children that nursery facilities just for the 3-year-olds 
are segregated -- those whose last names begin with A through L go to one room 
while the M's through Z's go to another. 
</P>
<P>
Willow Creek's colorful, precisely planned, multimedia services attract 1,000 
new churchgoers each year. Between 400 and 700 adults are baptized annually. 
And about 2,500 members meet weekly in scores of small groups to study the 
Bible and pray. 
</P>
<P>
Everything about Willow Creek Church -- from the plain but massive sign on the 
highway to the "neutral corporate setting" of the campus -- is designed to 
"impress . . . seekers with excellence but not ostentatiousness," says Hybels, 
who for five years was chaplain to the Chicago Bears football team. 
</P>
<P>
Hybels tailored the church's program to the needs and gripes people registered 
in his door-to-door survey. As a result, the congregation: 
</P>
<P>
* Doesn't have conventional "church worship" on weekends, yet fills its 
4,550-seat auditorium on Saturday nights and twice on Sunday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
* Has no altar, cross, vestments or other religious trappings, yet stresses 
"radical discipleship" to Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
* Has no choir, organ, hymnals or song books, yet produces professional-quality 
music, ranging from rock and jazz to country and classical. 
</P>
<P>
* Doesn't use offering envelopes, ask for pledges or hold fund-raising dinners, 
yet through voluntary giving surpasses its budget and recently built a 
$10-million complex on 120 acres. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to reach and teach 'non-churched Harrys and Marys' who have been 
turned off by the traditional church and are about to write off Christianity," 
explains Hybels. 
</P>
<P>
"Seekers can be anonymous here. You don't have to say anything, sing anything, 
sign anything or give anything." 
</P>
<P>
Church leaders throughout the nation and even overseas are taking notice of the 
Willow Creek style. 
</P>
<P>
Three times a year, 500 or more of them flock to Hybels' "how-we-do-it" 
conferences, where he walks pastors through his seven-step program to bring 
non-churched Harry and Mary full circle: They themselves go out and recruit 
"non-churched Larry and Cheri," as Hybels puts it. 
</P>
<P>
The key to growth in today's listless church market, observes Lyle Schaller, a 
parish consultant for Yokefellow Institute in Richmond, Ind., is a creative, 
imaginative pastor; extensive weekday programming, and "greater emphasis on the 
teaching ministry of the church." 
</P>
<P>
Schaller, a longtime watcher of church trends, also pointed to the radical 
reorientation of traditional Sunday services at Willow Creek as an example 
that's typical for many growing mega-churches. 
</P>
<P>
"They are much more attractive, less boring, more visual and less audio. They 
are more the agenda of the people than that of the minister. This is especially 
reflected in the music, preaching, skits and attention grabbers," he said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Willow Creek is an extraordinary example of young adults coming back to church 
in big numbers," Schaller added. "These people grew up in old-line 
(denominational) churches, drifted away and are now back -- but not in the 
denomination or congregation they were in before." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Hybels, who was raised in the Dutch Reformed Church, sees the "baby 
boomers" -- 25-to-45-year-olds -- who "grew up on television" as the primary 
target for his well-polished topical sermons. 
</P>
<P>
Hybels, who wears natty business suits instead of a clerical robe, delivers his 
messages from full notes as he stands behind a portable plexiglass lectern on 
the brown-carpeted Willow Creek stage. There is no pulpit, of course, and his 
audience sits in comfortable theater seats -- not pews. The auditorium's 
massive windows look out on a large lagoon graced with willow trees and 
populated by wild ducks and geese. 
</P>
<P>
After services, Hybels "works the bullpen" -- an area just below the right 
front corner of the stage -- where he chats individually with anyone who 
lingers. 
</P>
<P>
His sermons usually last 30 minutes, and he likes to preach series like a 
recent one on "Changing Times." Everything in the service meshes with his 
theme. One message in the series, "The Changing American Dream" -- on the 
illusory happiness of "having and doing it all" -- was preceded by a reading of 
Jesus' words in Matthew's Gospel, chapter 16, verses 25 and 26: 
</P>
<P>
"For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses his life 
for my sake shall find it. For what will a man be profited if he gains the 
whole world, and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his 
soul?" 
</P>
<P>
Layman Gilbert Bilezikian segued into the passage after speaking for several 
minutes on contemporary examples of "materialism and greed." Next was a 
humorous skit called "Confessions of an Ad-aholic," dramatizing the pitfalls of 
a consumptive life style. 
</P>
<P>
Though played by church volunteers, the skits -- a staple of weekend services 
-- are produced, choreographed and rehearsed under the watchful eye of Willow 
Creek's full-time drama director, Steve Pederson. Quality lighting and 
professional sound equipment back up each presentation. 
</P>
<P>
At this particular service, the music included a prelude by 10 flutists and a 
violinist, a vocal with three lead singers and a 15-piece combo -- and a 
jazzed-up version of "Down by the Riverside" for the offertory. 
</P>
<P>
Hybels eschews cliches, quotes news and financial magazines, and emphasizes 
"honesty, transparency" and "real-life problems" in his sermons. 
</P>
<P>
"Hybels is preaching a very upbeat message," said Stephen Warner, a sociologist 
at the University of Illinois in Chicago. "It's a salvationist message, but the 
idea is not so much being saved from the fires of hell. Rather, it's being 
saved from meaninglessness and aimlessness in this life. It's more of a 
soft-sell." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Hybels, who holds a bachelor's degree in biblical studies but is not 
seminary trained, pulls no punches: The "hidden cost" of the American dream may 
mean that dream chasers who "live spiritually alienated from God . . . pay the 
price in hell forever," he admonished, driving home his point from Matthew 25. 
</P>
<P>
If weekend services are for beginners in the faith ("Christianity 101 and 201," 
says Hybels) and not intended to provide worship for believers, meatier fare 
for "born-again" Christians ("Christianity 301 and 401") is served on Wednesday 
evenings. 
</P>
<P>
That service, called "New Community," plus 75 "subministries" -- everything 
from staffing Willow Creek's extensive food pantry for the needy to producing 
Christian dramas for the elderly -- make up the "core of the church," according 
to the Rev. Don Cousins, 32, Willow Creek's associate pastor for ministries. 
</P>
<P>
"The weekend services are the front door, but the church inside has to be the 
real thing," he told a group of 580 attentive church leaders at one of Willow 
Creek's conferences for pastors, "or else people will go right on out the back 
door." 
</P>
<P>
Hybels felt the call to the ministry at age 22 and walked out of the family's 
lucrative produce business. Becoming a church youth leader, he focused on 
events to draw in non-believers and quickly built up the group from 25 to 
1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Hybels asked three friends to help him canvass the Northwest Chicago 
suburbs to find out why adults didn't attend church. 
</P>
<P>
The answers, in order of frequency: They always ask for money; I don't like the 
music; I can't relate to the message; the services are boring, predictable and 
irrelevant; the pastor makes me feel guilty and ignorant, so I leave feeling 
worse than when I came. 
</P>
<P>
The follow-up question: What kind of church would attract you? 
</P>
<P>
The survey respondents wanted non-threatening anonymity, elementary-level 
teaching, excellence, "high take-home value" and "time to decide." 
</P>
<P>
"Non-churched Harry told us, 'Don't turn the screws tighter while I'm trying to 
find meaning in life and answers to perplexing ethical questions. Give me 
time,' " Hybels remembers. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding they wanted to start that kind of church, Hybels and friends sold 
tomatoes door to door in the summer of 1975 to raise enough money to rent the 
Willow Creek Theater in Palatine. 
</P>
<P>
Rousing contemporary-style Christian music, quality drama and low-key sermons 
lured newcomers -- who were studiously let alone and not hit up for money. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the Palatine theater couldn't hold the crowds, and the present church was 
built in 1981. Next spring, groundbreaking is planned for an $18-million 
ministry center and gymnasium housing three basketball courts. And there is 
talk of doubling the capacity of the auditorium -- already larger than any 
theater in Chicago -- and adding at least 20 more staff members to the present 
261. 
</P>
<P>
The initial philosophies still guide Willow Creek, where 1988 revenues were 
$8.2 million -- $150,000 a week -- and audited financial statements are made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the brown offering bags are passed at services, someone makes an 
announcement like this: "If some of you came to give monetary thanks, the 
ushers will come by; if not, and you didn't come prepared, that's OK. And if 
you're new today, we don't expect you to give because you're our guest." 
</P>
<P>
But the inner circle of followers is taught the biblical principle of tithing 
-- voluntarily giving 10% of personal income to the Lord's work. 
</P>
<P>
Hybels, his wife, and their two young children live near the church in a posh 
subdivision where $500,000 homes surround a lake. But theirs, built six years 
ago, cost $200,000, and they own only one car -- a 1985 Chevy suburban. 
</P>
<P>
Hybels has asked the church compensation committee not to increase his annual 
salary beyond the current $67,000. He said his only other income is modest 
royalties from seven books he has written, and honorariums from speaking and 
conducting funerals and weddings. He sets no fees for any of these services. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Hybels said, he turned down a $100,000 gift to the church "because it 
didn't fit with Willow Creek's purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Keenly aware of the credibility damage many independent church ministries have 
suffered as a result of financial scandals that snared some television 
evangelists, Hybels has stayed away from putting his church on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Neither has Hybels felt impelled to plant and staff satellite churches.

"The goal is not to produce Willow Creek clones, but Bible-based churches using 
spiritual gifts to the fullest," said Toni Konold, director of Willow Creek's 
cassette tape ministries. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, churches with similar formats and philosophies are popping up 
throughout the country -- at least 20 at last count, according to Willow 
Creek's church relations minister, Bob Bever. 
</P>
<P>
One in the making in Southern California, Horizons Community Church of 
Glendora, sent nine of its leaders to glean ideas from a recent Willow Creek 
conference for pastors. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback Valley Community Church, a flourishing 9-year-old congregation of 
4,000 that recently purchased a 113-acre site for expansion in southern Orange 
County, has not directly borrowed from the Willow Creek model. But pastor Rick 
Warren follows a style and outreach that is strikingly similar, reaching many 
previously un-churched baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
Hybels urges pastors to do their own marketing surveys and "listen to your 
people," rather than simply buying the whole Willow Creek package. 
</P>
<P>
Some former attendees, in fact, have not bought the Willow Creek philosophy and 
have gone elsewhere because they miss the traditional hymns, rituals and 
structures of denominational churches. Others have simply found the music too 
loud or the church too big. 
</P>
<P>
Hybels is nettled by the perception of some critics that Willow Creek is a 
"lightweight" church: "the assumption that we present entertainment with a 
convenience-oriented gospel." 
</P>
<P>
"That's very unfortunate," he says, propping his feet atop his desk during an 
interview. "I would say with a clear conscience that we challenge people to 
full commitment to Jesus Christ -- 95% commitment is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
But there's a tremendous price to keep what Hybels calls "the edge of 
excellence." 
</P>
<P>
Hybels readily acknowledges his high intensity and strict discipline. He 
usually arrives at his office between 5 and 6 each morning, lifts weights and 
runs two to four miles a day, fasts several days a week, and eats health foods. 
</P>
<P>
The stress of big-time ministry brought him dangerously close to "flipping out" 
several years back. Ever since, he has insisted on a regimen of regular rest, 
physical exercise, spiritual reflection, time off with his family, and personal 
accountability. He informally reports to three male confidants who, he says, 
would tell him "in a heartbeat" if he strayed off the track. 
</P>
<P>
He expects high performance from his associates as well. 
</P>
<P>
Willow Creek's eight elders -- three are women -- put in eight to 15 hours of 
volunteer work each week handling church business. The staff, too, feels the 
pressure of the pace. They understand what church marketing researcher George 
Barna of Glendale meant when he spoke about "Bill Hybels' . . . absolute 
dedication to see that everything must coincide with his vision . . . for a 
flourishing church." 
</P>
<P>
What hurts, Hybels avers, is when he's portrayed as "high profile, dictatorial, 
heavy-handed." 
</P>
<P>
"That's not true," he says. "I'm an incurable team player." 
</P>
<P>
His staff agrees -- as long as he's the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT: Bucking a downward trend.

Nicaragua proposed Sunday at the start of a two-day summit of Central American 
presidents that U.N. observers be given new powers and personnel to start 
disbanding the U.S.-backed Contras, a Nicaraguan source said. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvador government also rejected a truce proposed by leftist rebels 
fighting in that country. 
</P>
<P>
In return for demobilization of the Contras, the Nicaraguan government would 
consider resuming its cease-fire and "technical talks" with the leadership of 
the Honduras-based rebels, a Nicaraguan source said. 
</P>
<P>
The source close to the Nicaraguan delegation, who refused to be identified, 
also said Nicaragua is willing to allow the U.N. group now in Central America 
to verify that no weapons are sent from Nicaragua to El Salvador's leftist 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. observers were approved four months ago to monitor the voluntary 
repatriation of the Contras and to make sure that one country's territory was 
not being used to launch attacks on a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
The source, however, said the Nicaraguan government is not optimistic about 
acceptance of the proposal in view of the United States' "bipartisan decision 
to keep the Contras alive until after the February elections in Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua canceled its cease-fire with the Contras on Nov. 1, accusing them of 
disrupting registration for the Feb. 25 elections. 
</P>
<P>
Also at Sunday's opening session, the Salvadoran government rejected a 
cease-fire proposal by the leftist rebels of the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front (FMLN). 
</P>
<P>
The rebels asked for the dismissal of seven high-ranking military leaders in El 
Salvador and "full respect for human rights and democratic liberties of 
political and social organizations." 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran government instead asked the rebels to make a commitment not to 
launch attacks in urban areas and offered to resume negotiations in Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica proposed a truce in El Salvador from Dec. 12 through Jan. 15 "to 
give the FMLN and the government time to begin negotiations for a permanent 
cease-fire." Costa Rica also proposed that the United Nations be given powers 
to verify such a cease-fire in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The five Central American presidents opened their meeting in an atmosphere of 
frustration and pessimism, hoping the superpowers would help rescue the 
flagging peace efforts in the region. 
</P>
<P>
"We must face that reality" -- that the superpowers' help is needed -- said 
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Rodrigo Madrigal, who commented on the presidents' 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
He added that regional agreements will not have much validity in those places 
where parties in the conflicts have close ties to the United States and the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Attending the summit are presidents Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica, Alfredo 
Cristiani of El Salvador, Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo of Guatemala, Jose Azcona Hoyo 
of Honduras and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The presidents met briefly in a conference room, listened to a welcoming speech 
by Costa Rican Information Minister Jorge Urbina, and then went into a private 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Arias on Saturday had called the superpowers, without naming the United States 
and Soviet Union, "two-faced." He said they spoke about political solutions 
while encouraging military activities. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Madrigal said, "We must demand from them a definition of their 
roles, what they have done themselves or through other countries to exert a 
negative or positive influence in the region." 
</P>
<P>
He did not suggest how the superpowers might respond, but one source, speaking 
on the condition of anonymity, said the two might send representatives or 
observers to negotiations between the warring parties. 
</P>
<P>
The United States supports the Contras, who are fighting the leftist Sandinista 
government. It also backs El Salvador in its civil war against leftist 
insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
Washington accuses the Soviet Union and Cuba of providing arms and aid to 
Nicaragua, some of which it claims are finding their way to Salvadoran rebels. 
</P>
<P>
This summit had been scheduled to be held in Nicaragua, but it was changed to 
San Jose when El Salvador suspended relations with Nicaragua last month. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador took the action after two small planes were found in El Salvador 
carrying surface-to-air missiles that Cristiani said were being flown from 
Nicaragua to the FMLN. One plane crashed and the other was burned at a rural 
airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
Agreements reached at an August summit in Tela, Honduras, called for the 
Contras to disband by Dec. 5. However, their forces, headquartered in camps in 
Honduras, have remained in place.

S. AFRICA BLACKS ASK WHITES' AID IN REFORM BID

Concluding the largest anti-apartheid conference inside South Africa in 34 
years, black leaders Sunday invited South African whites to join them in an 
intensified campaign of civil disobedience to pressure President Frederik W. de 
Klerk to move more swiftly to dismantle apartheid and open negotiations with 
the black majority. 
</P>
<P>
The 4,662 black, white, mixed-race and Indian delegates, in resolutions adopted 
late Saturday at a closed session, declared De Klerk's reform initiatives 
"devoid of any substance. There have been no actions to back up his vague 
promises." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to end apartheid and exploitation as soon as possible," the delegates 
said in a statement issued Sunday. "If De Klerk can convince us that he is 
serious about genuine negotiations, . . . we are ready to talk about the 
creation of a democratic South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Conference for a Democratic Future brought together 
representatives of more than 2,100 organizations, several major black 
organizations either boycotted the meeting or were not invited. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was the left-wing Pan-Africanist Movement, an ideological twin of 
the outlawed Pan-Africanist Congress which opposes the African National 
Congress' philosophy of non-racism. Also excluded was the Inkatha movement, 
headed by the moderate Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, who opposes the 
ANC's guerrilla tactics as too militant. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy Morobe, a spokesman for the conference, acknowledged that black unity 
remains elusive, but he said that "a firm basis was established for the 
political direction of all anti-apartheid forces well into the 1990s." He 
described the 1990s as "the decade of the final onslaught against apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
The resolutions solidified the well-known position of mainstream anti-apartheid 
groups, led by the outlawed ANC and the like-minded Mass Democratic Movement. 
Those organizations have demanded that De Klerk dismantle racial segregation 
laws, release all political prisoners, lift the state of emergency and allow 
free political activity before negotiations can begin. 
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the De Klerk government is not interested in creating a 
democratic South Africa, nor is it interested in genuine negotiations," one 
resolution said. "Clearly, De Klerk is buying time to re-order the forces of 
minority domination and win over some of our people to his fraudulent schemes." 
</P>
<P>
Since taking power in September, De Klerk has pledged to create a climate for 
negotiations for "a new South Africa," in which the 5 million whites will share 
power with the 26 million blacks. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of conciliatory moves, De Klerk has released several prominent 
political prisoners, opened the country's few remaining whites-only beaches, 
promised to do away with a law that empowers local municipalities to deny 
blacks access to public facilities, allowed dozens of protest marches through 
city streets and brought the nearly autonomous power of the security 
establishment under direct Cabinet control. 
</P>
<P>
The one-day conference adopted a resolution demanding multiracial elections for 
an assembly that would draft a constitution establishing a one-person, one-vote 
system. De Klerk has rejected that concept, offering instead to negotiate a 
constitution that would extend limited political rights to the black majority. 
He wants to select negotiators for those talks in segregated elections. 
</P>
<P>
Another resolution urged whites to "break with apartheid," stage solidarity 
marches into black townships and campaign to create new municipalities by 
merging white cities and their adjoining black townships. 
</P>
<P>
The conference also urged black labor unions to escalate their confrontational 
activities, suggesting that they occupy the Johannesburg Stock Exchange if 
necessary to prevent privatization of major state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
"We call upon our people to reject capitalism and (the) free market system," a 
resolution on economics said. 
</P>
<P>
Other resolutions urged parents and students to defy school segregation 
policies, demanded land redistribution and urged young white men to refuse 
mandatory military service. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was one of the largest anti-apartheid gatherings inside South 
Africa since 1955.

An actress was hospitalized in a coma Sunday after plunging from the stage into 
a basement during a scene change in a production of "Camelot." 
</P>
<P>
Gaynor Young, an understudy who had been pressed into the starring role of 
Guinevere, fell about 40 feet while the stage was blacked out for a scene 
change in Saturday night's performance of the musical at the State Theater in 
Pretoria. The performance was canceled after theater staff found that Young had 
plunged down an opening in the stage. 
</P>
<P>
She was listed in critical condition in the intensive care unit of a Pretoria 
hospital. Doctors said she suffered brain injuries and a broken arm and wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Young was filling in as Guinevere because the lead actress lost her voice after 
Friday's performance.

When the dozens of youngsters gathered for the children's sermon Sunday morning 
at the Church of the Holy Trinity, they found their mascot, a two-foot-high, 
stuffed church mouse named Matthew, with a torn-up letter in his lap. 
</P>
<P>
"This was Matthew's letter to Santa Claus," explained the parish's Canadian 
priest, Father Brian Allan, as the children crowded around. "Matthew had asked 
Santa for a toy gun. 
</P>
<P>
"But last week Matthew got bombed. He got shot at. Not with toy guns, but with 
real ones. And Matthew saw a lot of people die. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, Matthew doesn't want a toy gun for Christmas anymore." 
</P>
<P>
It was a day of reckoning at the Church of the Holy Trinity, the Episcopal 
church in the exclusive Forbes Park subdivision of the Makati district, 
Manila's financial and commercial hub. The posh area of office buildings, shops 
and luxury condominiums was besieged and under fire for most of last week as 
rebellious soldiers staged the worst-ever coup attempt against President 
Corazon Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
Parishioners had seen death in their neighborhood. They'd seen bullets and 
light artillery shells smash through their living room windows and land near 
their beds. They'd seen rebel snipers commandeer their luxurious condominiums 
and take up positions on the high-rise balconies. 
</P>
<P>
And when he turned to the children's parents later in the Sunday Mass, Allan, 
who was holed up in his church through most of the ordeal, summed up the 
feelings of most of the foreigners and Filipinos in the pews. 
</P>
<P>
"This week, many of us came very, very close to Judgment Day. . . ," he said, 
"closer than any other year in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
So it was in much of this devout Christian nation Sunday. Christmas shoppers 
began flooding stores, and families began restocking their cupboards in 
Makati's modern shopping centers. But Sunday was also a day of reflection, of 
mourning and of soul-searching, as the horrors and the lessons of a week that 
saw 83 Filipinos killed and hundreds wounded in Manila's worst street fighting 
since World War II began to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
President Aquino also committed her day to soothing wounds and easing pain. 
</P>
<P>
She traveled by presidential helicopter to the province of Batangas, 50 miles 
south of Manila, to attend the funeral of a pro-government fighter pilot who 
crashed in his F-5 jet while strafing rebel positions at the height of the coup 
10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Seated beside the president at the ceremony, Evita Domingo Atienza, the widow 
of Maj. Danilo Atienza of the 6th Tactical Fighter Squadron, wept hysterically 
as her husband's flag-draped coffin was blessed in a pavilion outside the 
provincial hall. 
</P>
<P>
Rooftop anti-sniper teams searched the area for potential assassins, and 
commandos in black berets formed a ring of security as Aquino lavished praise 
on the 38-year-old pilot. Atienza crashed during his seventh strafing run on 
his third sortie of the day on Dec. 1. The cause of the crash is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"He is what we Filipinos would like to be," Aquino told reporters later. "He 
showed greatness, and he was never concerned about himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I assured the family of Maj. Atienza, like in my case, that they should 
believe they are not alone in this." 
</P>
<P>
And the president, herself widowed by a political killing, talked tough about 
the officers and soldiers who staged the bloody coup, vowing retribution. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make sure that justice is done, that those who are guilty will be 
meted the full penalty," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Such a task is likely to be a difficult one, and Aquino's loyal military forces 
also spent the day taking a hard look inside their own ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Armed forces spokesman Col. Juanito Rimando confirmed that the three officers 
the government believes led the coup -- Lt. Col. Gregorio (Gringo) Honasan, 
Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina and Maj. Abraham Puruggunan -- remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
Puruggunan, who led the rebel force that took over the Makati district and held 
it for three days, apparently just strolled away unchallenged last Thursday 
when the rebels gave up and marched to their barracks. 
</P>
<P>
It was Puruggunan who, just minutes before he slipped into the Makati crowd, 
declared on national television, "We have won some important victories." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging deep, lingering splits within every arm of the military, a top 
aide to Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos said: "There's got to be reforms now. 
President Aquino must revamp her Cabinet. Heads must roll. 
</P>
<P>
"And in the military, we have to go back to square one, or maybe one step 
behind that, and do some investigating on the extent of involvement, the depth 
of involvement." 
</P>
<P>
But, in Makati and other hard-hit Manila districts, the damage assessment was 
far more immediate. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims of Manila's bloodiest coup ever were not soldiers. They 
were civilians -- a 60-year-old man blown to pieces by a grenade as he made his 
way to the post office to collect a $400 Christmas check from his daughter in 
America; a 6-year-old girl who was torn apart by shrapnel when a stray round 
landed in her squatter's colony, and a young maid who was shot between the eyes 
by a sniper when she poked her head out the window of a posh Makati 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Candles burned throughout the day Sunday at funeral parlors and churches where 
the coup victims lay. But there was one victim who best illustrated Father 
Allan's children's sermon on Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
It was a teen-age boy who was shot and killed on a Makati street as he ran 
through the cross-fire to pick up the M-16 rifle of a fallen government 
soldier. 
</P>
<P>
All the young man wanted, his friends said later, was a souvenir.

POLICE IN BEIJING REPORTEDLY SEIZE 6 STUDENT PROTESTERS

Police hauled off six university students after they staged a brief protest at 
a government ministry in Beijing, Chinese sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, all men who appeared to be in their early 20s, marched in 
front of the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television building in western Beijing 
on Saturday afternoon, according to the sources, some of whom witnessed the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration defied a martial-law ban on public protests that was imposed 
in most of Beijing last May 20. It also violated a tough new law against street 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the protesters were students at the Beijing Institute of 
Aeronautics and Astronautics, one of the most active campuses in last spring's 
protests. Their reason for demonstrating was unknown, but they carried two 
large red banners with white lettering. 
</P>
<P>
One read, "Why Is China So Poor?" The other said, "Television Must Make People 
Happy," possibly a sardonic reference to recent government exhortations to 
stress positive propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
A stunned crowd of 200 to 300 people surrounded the demonstrators, according to 
the sources. They said police watched the protest for a few minutes and then 
hauled off the students. It was not known if they were formally arrested.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III, defending the Bush Administration's 
attempt to repair its relationship with China, said Sunday that continued 
isolation of the Beijing regime would only "compound the tragedy" of the bloody 
repression of the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said President Bush decided to send White House national security adviser 
Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger to China 
to revive the "geopolitical and geostrategic" relationship between the two 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
The trip, which shattered Bush's ban on high-level visits, was not announced 
until Scowcroft and Eagleburger were already in China on Saturday. 
Nevertheless, it drew a chorus of criticism from Capitol Hill, where the 
prevailing sentiment calls for toughening, rather than relaxing, sanctions 
against the Beijing government. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on the ABC-TV program "This Week with David Brinkley," Baker said 
Scowcroft and Eagleburger emphasized U.S. concern about human rights in their 
talks in China. But he said it is time to restore a more normal relationship 
between Washington and Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the American people would want to see their government compound 
the tragedy of Tian An Men Square," Baker said. "It is our judgment . . . that 
that is what would happen if we try to isolate China." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Washington continues to maintain economic sanctions against China, 
but "it is a question of moving responsibly, reasonably and with due regard for 
human rights to try to preserve a relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that Chinese students "absolutely" will be permitted to remain in 
the United States until it is safe for them to return home despite Bush's veto 
of legislation, passed overwhelmingly by Congress, to suspend the requirement 
that students return to China after completing their studies. 
</P>
<P>
About 70% or 80% of the estimated 40,000 Chinese students in this country have 
visas saying they are sponsored by the Chinese government -- although many 
students say their tuition and expenses actually are paid by U.S. universities 
or private sources -- and thus are subject to the requirement to return home 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was interviewed just hours before he was scheduled to leave on a weeklong 
trip to Europe for consultations with U.S. allies about the fast-changing 
situation in Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze, interviewed on the CBS-TV program "Face the Nation," said Moscow 
is ready for a totally new relationship with the United States in which the 
superpowers no longer regard each other as adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
Underlining the comments of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Malta 
summit, Shevardnadze said, "The Soviet Union is ready to no longer regard the 
United States of America as its adversary, and we are ready to state that 
publicly." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he envisioned the U.S.-Soviet relationship as one between friends, 
Shevardnadze said, "Like partners and like friends." Then he added: "Friends 
sometimes have arguments, too."

COMMUNISM: MOVEMENTS FOR DEMOCRATIC CHANGE SUCCEEDED IN EASTERN EUROPE BUT NOT 
IN BEIJING. SCHOLARS TELL WHY.

<P>
Why did events come out so differently this year in Eastern Europe than in 
China? Why did the movements toward democratic changes succeed in Warsaw, 
Prague, Budapest and East Berlin while failing in Beijing? 
</P>
<P>
Scholars point to several factors that help explain why the Chinese regime was 
willing and able to carry out a forceful crackdown while East European 
governments were not. 
</P>
<P>
First, they say, China, unlike the East Bloc regimes, is still being led by its 
first generation of Communist leaders -- the same elderly men, now in their 
80s, who carried out the Chinese revolution. 
</P>
<P>
There is no comparable group of leaders in any East European country. Even 
Erich Honecker, the 77-year-old leader who ruled East Germany from 1971 until 
last October, is a neophyte when compared to China's octogenarian Old Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, 85, joined the Communist Party in 1924, helped 
win one of the most important military campaigns during China's civil war and 
first served as general secretary of the party in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping and his associates were prepared to defend the power that they 
had accumulated over the years," observes Roderick MacFarquhar, a Harvard 
University professor. 
</P>
<P>
Second, analysts say, the countries of Eastern Europe have a history and 
tradition of democratic institutions and culture, while China does not. 
</P>
<P>
"The degree of political sophistication in Eastern Europe is much higher than 
in China," says Richard Baum, a professor of political science at UCLA. "In 
Eastern Europe, there's a pluralistic structure already in place. You have the 
(Roman Catholic) Church, labor unions, intellectual groupings that don't exist 
in China." 
</P>
<P>
Also, experts say, the people of Eastern Europe have had a far greater exposure 
to the West, and to Western ideas, than have the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
"China was not part of what we might call a competitive democratic environment 
the way the Eastern European states are," asserts MacFarquhar. "To the Chinese, 
the arena for comparison is East Asia -- countries such as Taiwan, South Korea 
and Singapore. None of these places have had real democratic government. Even 
the Japanese example is ambiguous." 
</P>
<P>
The third factor is the crucial role played by the Soviet Union and President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
In Eastern Europe, Gorbachev permitted -- indeed encouraged -- the changes, 
largely by making it clear that Soviet troops would not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
No Soviet troops are stationed in China, and neither Gorbachev nor any other 
Soviet leader has ever had the sort of influence in China that the Soviets have 
long held in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
MacFarquhar notes that the Communist governments of Eastern Europe were, in 
effect, colonial regimes installed at the instigation of the Soviet Union. The 
Chinese Communist Party, by contrast, has always been independent of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually the same explanation was offered recently by Chinese Premier Li Peng, 
one of the hard-line leaders who spearheaded last June's military crackdown in 
Beijing. Li was asked recently about the changes in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"China is naturally concerned," he said. However, he added, "China does not 
link events in East Germany and events in China, because there are many 
differences between the two. . . . China adopted socialism to provide its 
people with better living conditions and economic prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
Li's indirect message was that East European countries adopted socialism for 
other reasons, such as the pressure of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all these differences, specialists say, the changes in Eastern Europe 
might not have taken place as peacefully as they have were it not for last 
June's turmoil in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
At the peak of the crisis in East Germany, for example, Honecker reportedly 
instructed East German officials to prepare for a "Chinese solution" to the 
throngs of pro-democracy demonstrators. But Egon Krenz, who later replaced him 
as president, and other East German officials reportedly dissuaded him from 
carrying out the order. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened in China probably sobered the leaders of these other countries 
to realize how high the costs of a crackdown would be, both at home and 
overseas," Baum says.

HOUSE PANEL ACCUSES KOOP OF IGNORING MEDICAL EVIDENCE ON SAFETY OF ABORTION; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: FORMER SURGEON GENERAL CALLS CHARGE 'RIDICULOUS.' SIX REPUBLICANS 
DISSENT FROM REPORT'S FINDINGS.

<P>
Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop ignored overwhelming medical evidence 
that abortion is safer than pregnancy and childbirth when he declined last 
January to write a report on the health effects of the procedure, a House 
subcommittee charged Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognize the diversity of opinions regarding the morality of abortion under 
different circumstances, but those opinions must not be allowed to interfere 
with scientific research or with making information available to the public," 
said Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Government Operations 
subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations, which released 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
Koop, a staunch opponent of abortion, was asked in 1987 by then-President 
Ronald Reagan to study the physical and mental impact of abortion on women and 
write a report to the public. In January, 1989, he told Reagan in a letter that 
it was impossible to reach clear judgments on the subject because the 
scientific evidence was inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
But the Weiss subcommittee said that transcripts of 27 confidential meetings 
between Koop and pro-choice and anti-abortion advocates, subpoenaed by the 
subcommittee, reveal that Koop had stated on several occasions that legal 
abortion was safer than pregnancy and childbirth and poses no public health 
risks to women's mental or physical health. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the subcommittee said, Koop reviewed research on the medical impact of 
abortion that confirmed its safety, and a draft report -- which was never 
issued -- concluded that "abortion does not pose a physical risk to the 
mother." 
</P>
<P>
"In contrast, (he) . . . contradicted those views by claiming that the impact 
of abortion on women's health was not yet scientifically established," the 
subcommittee said. 
</P>
<P>
Koop said in a telephone interview Sunday that he was surprised at the thrust 
of the Weiss report. He said he had made it quite clear, both in his letter to 
Reagan and in public comments, that abortions are overwhelmingly safe. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that was important (to document) was the psychological problems," he 
said, "and I said at the time that there was abundant anecdotal evidence on the 
psychological impact, but no scientific evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Koop criticized Weiss for issuing such a report at this time, calling it "very 
old news." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what his point is," the former surgeon general said. "Anything in 
the report that says we had information that we didn't give is ridiculous. 
Anything that I would have dished out would have been opposite to his ideology, 
so I don't know what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no point to concentrating on a medical report when it's been proven 
that abortions are medically safe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Six Republican members of the full 38-member Government Operations committee 
joined in dissenting from the report released by Weiss. Rep. Dick Armey 
(R-Tex.), ranking Republican on the subcommittee, called the report "a 
misleading and inaccurate picture of abortion issues," and said it 
"misconstrues" statements made by Koop. 
</P>
<P>
The former surgeon general, Armey said, "explicitly disavowed" his connection 
with the draft abortion report. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Armey said he had "extraordinary difficulty" understanding how a 
"serious examination can be conducted on the health effects of abortion without 
also examining the health consequences incurred by the pre-born child." 
</P>
<P>
He said the subcommittee could not "ignore the central questions of whether or 
not life begins at conception, and whether or not pre-born children should be 
accorded certain rights of protection." This, he said, was an "essential 
element" toward understanding the psychological impact of abortion on women. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee report also charged the federal government with failing to 
fund contraceptive research that it said "is necessary to decrease the 1.5 
million abortions obtained by American women every year." 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee called on the federal government to increase research funds to 
develop "effective contraceptives and thus decrease the number of abortions." 
The report said that 11% of American women between the ages of 15 and 44 become 
pregnant every year, and more than half of these pregnancies are unintended. 
Half of the unintended pregnancies end in abortion, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that last year the National Institute on Child Health and Human 
Development spent $9.5 million on contraceptive development, which, taking 
inflation into account, was a reduction of almost 50% compared to the $12 
million spent in fiscal year 1980. Further, the report said, such funding could 
drop to as low as $5 million for fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee also accused the Reagan Administration of "censoring" 
scientific information on abortion collected by the Centers for Disease Control 
because it did not support an anti-abortion view. It recommended that the 
Department of Health and Human Services assure from now on that "federal 
research aimed at improving the public health is not censored."

GREEN MEADOWS CENTER GREETS SANTA'S HELPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Green Meadows Recreation Center in South Central Los Angeles looked like 
Santa's workshop under siege Saturday, as 150 little Santa's helpers went to 
work decorating fuzzy red-and-white Christmas stockings. 
</P>
<P>
Deeply intent, the children let their artistic juices -- mainly glue and paint 
of every color -- go with the creative flow as they heaped on sequins, bows, 
streamers, feathers, cotton, pompons, pipe cleaners and buttons. 
</P>
<P>
Glitter flew. Egos soared. And somehow order emerged from the colorful chaos. 
</P>
<P>
The material for the three-hour art workshop was donated by local merchants. 
McDonald's donated 150 hamburgers to feed the hungry artists, and local TV news 
reporter Lonnie Lardner provided the instruction, as well as the impetus for 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming a broadcaster, Lardner studied art at Ecole des Beaux-Arts in 
France and Parson's School of Design in New York. Earlier this year, she 
decided it was time to share her artistic talent. 
</P>
<P>
Lardner contacted a man who worked with Los Angeles' Community Youth Gang 
Services, who told her the inner-city parks were in trouble -- but that each 
time a park sponsored productive activities, drug dealing and gang activity was 
pushed back a bit. Lardner got in touch with Marlene Armstrong, senior director 
of the Green Meadows center, a well-maintained recreation facility in a part of 
town park rangers call "tough." 
</P>
<P>
When Lardner and Armstrong attempted their initial project for Halloween -- 
inviting local children to carve donated pumpkins and eat free hamburgers -- 
Lardner had a vision of the kids cynically smashing their jack-o'-lanterns on 
the street as they walked home. 
</P>
<P>
But "at the end of the day, they all walked off with these glowing faces, 
carrying their little pumpkins and little trick-or-treat bags with real pride," 
Lardner said. "My heart felt good." 
</P>
<P>
Money and donations for the Christmas workshop came in "dribs and drabs," 
Lardner said. But volunteers came in from all over. A friend of Lardner, a 
hairstylist for "Mr. Belvedere" television show, darted between the tables, 
gradually accumulating as much glue and sequins as some of the stockings. 
Another couple said they'd met while both were living on Skid Row. Now they've 
managed to pull themselves up a notch or so on the socioeconomic ladder and are 
ready to help children who may be tottering, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lord brought my mommy out of Skid Row," pronounced 6-year-old Jeramiah, 
holding up a Christmas ornament he'd decorated in a black and gold motif 
vaguely reminiscent of a Czarist icon. 
</P>
<P>
Some children worked with a Jackson Pollack-like abandon, soaking their 
stockings and the hats they were decorating with glue and then heaping on every 
decoration within reach. 
</P>
<P>
Others took a minimalist approach, agonizing over exactly where they would 
place each sequin and pompon. Between projects, youngsters armed with dripping 
paintbrushes and oozing glue bottles ricocheted between tables. Some chased the 
elusive artistic muse over to the nearby swings, down the slide and back again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never really know who was touched here, who may be a Picasso, Van Gogh or 
Dali down the road," Lardner said afterward, gold glitter sparkling in her 
magenta lipstick. "But I think any creativity and productivity they experience 
now will show up as creativity and productivity later in life." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the kids were already headed home, skipping along in glittery hats 
and clutching glittery Christmas stockings down streets decorated with graffiti 
and razor wire.

A BALANCING OF THE BAR;

<P>
WOMEN IN LAW FIND PROFESSION IS STILL TILTED IN FAVOR OF MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For women lawyers, all the trials aren't occur ring in courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
A decade or so after women began entering the profession in numbers, women 
lawyers in many major cities, including Los Angeles, believe they are paid as 
much as their male colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
But a majority complain that they continue to experience sexual harassment -- 
ranging from leers to rapes -- in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the female professionals still feel frustrated by 
the traditional old boys' network, including all-male clubs. 
</P>
<P>
And most, despite their six-figure salaries and other perks, find the demands 
of the profession incompatible with a personal life or child-rearing. 
</P>
<P>
These were some of the findings of a recently released national survey of 918 
female lawyers in 56 of the largest law firms in 13 cities, 10% of the 
respondents in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that women at the large firms seemed to be among the best, brightest 
and wealthiest women in the profession," said Doreen Weisenhaus, 
editor-in-chief of the National Law Journal, which, with West Publishing Co. of 
Minneapolis, conducted the study in October and November. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone in this field would have a chance to succeed, it would be these 
women," Weisenhaus explained. But, she added, "we found that they had their 
share of problems." 
</P>
<P>
The survey -- which reached many of the same conclusions as another recent 
study by a unit of the California Bar Assn. -- had one relatively bright spot 
for women lawyers in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
It found that, compared with women lawyers in Boston (which fared lowest in all 
categories) or Chicago, "there are a lot of happy people in L.A," Weisenhaus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, law firms in Los Angeles and in Washington scored better on equal 
opportunities for women -- in management, promotions, job assignments -- than 
did those in any of the surveyed cities, which included Atlanta, Cleveland, 
Dallas, Houston, Miami, Philadelphia, New York, San Francisco and Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
Salary was not an issue. Fully a third of the respondents nationwide earned 
more than $100,000 a year; more than three-fourths thought salaries and bonuses 
were on a par with those of male lawyers in their firms. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sign of the times that 66% of the women surveyed have been in law for 
seven years or less and 62% are under 34. Elaine Weiss, a lawyer who is staff 
director of the American Bar Assn.'s Commission on Women in the Profession, 
points out that, in 1970, women were only 3%-4% of all the nation's lawyers. 
Today, 20% of an estimated total of 700,000 are women. 
</P>
<P>
But what many of the women are saying now is that the law is all-consuming: 77% 
said they had sacrificed outside interests and 82% said they had sacrificed 
time with their families. 
</P>
<P>
It is little wonder, considering that the minimum expected billing time, about 
2,000 hours each year in big firms in big cities, represents only part of the 
time a lawyer works. Other responsibilities, including meetings and 
administrative tasks, can increase the hours by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
While confronting a crushing professional workload, women have family concerns 
to deal with, too. And 42% of the women surveyed nationally said they had 
delayed having children to further their careers. Although 62% are married, 
only 32% have children in the household. 
</P>
<P>
Although 75% said their firms offered flextime or part-time work -- scheduling 
options that constitute what some have dubbed a "mommy track" -- 90% said that 
following this arrangement would be a serious impediment to advancement toward 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
The 60% who said they had been targets of unwanted sexual attention said it 
came equally from male supervisors, colleagues and clients; a quarter of the 
women said they had been touched, leaned over, cornered or pinched; 13 women 
reported attempts at or actual rapes and assaults. But only 7% reported the 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
That women feel some frustration and anger over their careers was evidenced by 
the detailed, unsolicited comments they offered with survey responses. 
</P>
<P>
"My interests have become so narrow it is difficult to relate to new 
acquaintances and people in other fields," a law firm associate in Miami-Tampa 
wrote. A Washingtonian said she had made so many compromises in her personal 
life that, on being named a partner recently, "My primary reaction is to feel 
resentful." 
</P>
<P>
Others cited strains on their marriages, inability to conceive and regret at 
postponing motherhood, unbearable stress, long hours required to meet billable 
hour requirements and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Even though 83% of the law firms have written policies permitting paid 
maternity or parental leaves (typically between six weeks and three months), 
almost half the women said that associates who take the time risk their career 
advancement; only 20% felt that a man opting for parental leave would not hurt 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
Although women today are half of all law school graduates, 60% of the 
respondents reported that, in job interviews, they had been asked such 
inappropriate questions as their marriage plans, whether they planned children, 
how their mates felt about their careers, how they would handle child care and 
whether they used birth control. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of male mentors was often cited as a professional stumbling block; 
more than half the women said male supervisors were less willing or unwilling 
to mentor women. 
</P>
<P>
As for the old "dress for success" image -- no-nonsense man-tailored suit, 
floppy tie, short hair -- it appears to be out; only 32% of the women said they 
adhere to the traditional dress rules. Expensive, not conservative, seems to be 
the idea now. Women said they refuse to dress like "short men in skirts" or 
"prison matrons." 
</P>
<P>
Some, still a minority, said they keep fresh flowers and family photos in their 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
Summing up, the respondents said law firms need to recognize human needs of all 
their employees, men and women, and address the problems of working mothers. 
Suggestions included sabbaticals that would allow women to return to work 
full-time when their children are older and provision of both emergency child 
care and on-site child care. 
</P>
<P>
Both men and women need time for personal growth, they suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Are surveys such as this, and the recent study by the California Bar's 
Committee on Women in the Law, merely preaching to the converted? Or can they 
make a difference? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are good," said Harry L. Hathaway, a senior partner at the firm 
of Hill, Farrer and Burrill and this year's president of the Los Angeles County 
Bar Assn. "It does tend to sensitize us to the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, he noted, the county Bar's "jurist of the year," Superior Court 
Judge Robert Weil, said in accepting the honor that he hoped lawyers would do 
one thing: Remove gender bias from the court. 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway said, "California, I think, is ahead of the rest of the country in 
terms of integration of women and minorities into the profession, both of which 
we have not done very well with. I think the statistics are embarrassing and 
miserable. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to justify anything (but) to respond to the old boy network, it 
is really tough on women," he added. "One of the main frustrations to me is 
that the business world is very discriminatory toward women . . . when the 
client wants to go out to the drinking establishment, it's a man (client). 
Rarely do you see a woman in those positions. I think its very frustrating to 
the woman. 
</P>
<P>
He agrees with survey respondents that law firms need to be humanized: "If you 
talk even to my wife, she'll tell you . . . It's hard on the family, my 
marriage to my profession. That is a problem . . . it's been that way since 
I've been in it (26 years) and it's gotten worse because of the emphasis on 
bottom line."

Audre Engleman -- a partner at Rogers and Wells, chair of the Status of Women 
Lawyers Committee for the Women Lawyers' Assn. of Los Angeles and a member of 
the state Bar survey committee -- says, "I think these surveys are extremely 
important. It's a nonoffensive way of raising the issues and, the more that 
these issues are discussed, the more possibility there is that improvement will 
be made." 
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, it seems obvious that money is not the issue -- women 
lawyers have plenty of money to pay for child care, but can't find quality 
care. "People call it day care, but what about night care, when you're working 
'till 9 or 10 o'clock?" 
</P>
<P>
The survey by the California women lawyers' group did not differ drastically in 
its findings from the national survey. For example, nearly half of the 600 
respondents representing a cross section of women lawyers reported experiencing 
sexual harassment on the job, almost two-thirds believe they are not accepted 
as lawyers by men in the profession and 88% cited a subtle, pervasive gender 
bias in the profession. 
</P>
<P>
In the California survey, one woman related the following: "The other day, we 
were sitting down to settlement negotiations with a big client. Just before the 
meeting started, my boss asked me to get him a cup of coffee. I was the only 
female attorney present. The message to The Boys: 'She may be an attorney, but 
don't take her seriously.' " 
</P>
<P>
Respondents also said there was a widespread perception that being a parent is 
a liability for a woman lawyer. The survey said that addressing ways to make 
legal careers compatible with family life should be "of the highest priority" 
for the state Bar. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a partner (at a New York firm) say to me last year, 'There is no issue 
in women's advancement here at this firm any more,' " Engleman noted. "Then, in 
another sentence, he said, 'We can't keep these women, though.' The connection 
hasn't been made that the place of employment is not hospitable." 
</P>
<P>
Engleman does not perceive hostility toward women in the profession. Rather, 
she says, it is a combination of "ignorance and economics." 
</P>
<P>
Discrimination has been a fact for women lawyers "in more or less overt 
fashion" since women came into the profession, said Margaret Morrow, a senior 
partner with Quinn, Kully and Morrow and last year's county Bar president. 
"Many of these matters are questions of perception. 
</P>
<P>
"I think very well-intentioned male attorneys and male businessmen don't always 
appreciate the perception which either a chance remark or some other action on 
their part may have," she said. "It's a question of sensitivity more often than 
it is intentional differential treatment." 
</P>
<P>
In Morrow's view, "The single most difficult issue facing women lawyers, and 
probably all women professionals, today" is balancing family life and career. 
"Where the battle lines are really being drawn are family-career issues and 
whose responsibility it is to care for and raise children" -- his, hers or 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow is convinced that "legal employers, all employers, have to begin to 
recognize that, with so many women in the career marketplace, they are going to 
have to change their ways of doing business if they want to retain bright, 
talented, ambitious, achieving people." 
</P>
<P>
She is married to Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Paul Boland and has a 
2-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
But she says she juggles family life and career "at the cost of personal stress 
and strain. And that's true of my husband, as well. It is a partnership (but) 
even so there are days when we wonder if we've prioritized correctly."

Author, Author: Fifth-grader Eleanor Ray of Fountain Valley launched her 
writing career with an exclusive interview from former President Ronald Reagan, 
held at his Century City offices last week. The 10-year-old, representing a 
national children's magazine, quizzed Reagan on tough issues: Could he play a 
musical instrument? Reagan pulled out a harmonica and hit some notes. What was 
the worst part of being President? "Sending soldiers into battle," Reagan 
replied. What was the best part?', "Being able to change things," he said.

Senior Version: Fresno entrepreneur Max Wegerbauer, 53, has come up with a 
Sensuous Seniors calendar featuring "golden oldie" women, ages 50 to 73. The 
calendar "girls," all from the San Joaquin valley, include a former Ice Capades 
skater, an artist who lifts weights and plays the flute and a school employee 
who bounces on a trampoline. 
</P>
<P>
"First I thought of using people like Jane Fonda, Tina Turner and Lena Horne. I 
couldn't afford them. And people would say they were the exception to the 
rule," said Wegerbauer, whose goal is to show that older women can be, well, 
womanly.

Cold Warrior: Author Tom Clancy, master of Iron Curtain thrillers, says he's 
not worried that warming relations between the super-powers will put his career

this for 30 years, and then the 31st year I say, 'Hey, you're not such a bad 
guy after all,' but I don't move. Would you still be worried?" 
</P>

Clancy said he'll find plenty of grist for his best-selling novels of 
U.S.-Soviet conflict as long as the Soviet Union remains a communist military 
power.

Red Baiter: A gigantic lobster named Lobzilla was spared a date with a pot of 
boiling water after a wave of public sympathy. He was flown from North Carolina 
to Maine by an animal rights group, and there returned to the ocean. The 
21-pound lobster almost got cooked and served in Shucker's Oyster Bar in 
Charlotte, but the animal rights group raised a cry and restaurant manager Kurt 
Larkins gave Lobzilla to the group, gratis. The lobster measured more than 3 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
"He's beautiful, truly majestic," said Cam MacQueen of People for the Ethical 
Treatment of Animals. She accompanied Lobzilla, who traveled in an icebox 
labeled: "Eat beans, not beings." She estimated the creature is 150 years old.

"Sometimes it's a question of the atmosphere within a firm. A lot of remarks 
made about "lady lawyers" or "lady judges" or "we had a cute little lady in for 
a client" tend to make women think they are disvalued. (Sometimes) it's 
perceived the client would not "do well" with a woman or it's perceived the 
subject matter of the particular case is "more up a man's alley" . . . or 
someone determines a woman is simply "not aggressive" enough to handle a 
matter."

Washington Buys Building: Dancer-choreographer Lula Washington has purchased 
the mid-city building that has housed her studio and company, L.A. Contemporary 
Dance Theatre, for the past seven years. Faced with the reality of no financial 
cushion to even begin to meet the purchase price of $225,000 asked by 
owner-actor Taurean Blacque, Washington and her board of directors raised the 
$158,000 down payment in six months with no help from traditional lending 
institutions. Washington mortgaged her family home, and in a grass roots effort 
sought grants, loans and donations of varying sizes from a variety of community 
organizations, agencies and individuals. The balance is due by the end of 1990, 
and $150,000 more is required for earthquake upgrade, so fund-raising 
continues. Washington is planning a January open house and celebration. The 
building, located on Adams Boulevard, is a former Masonic Temple. Claudia Puig

Bernini Sculpture at Auction: A white marble bust of Pope Gregory XV by 
17th-Century master Gianlorenzo Bernini will be auctioned at Christie's New 
York on Jan. 10. The rare sculpture is expected to bring more than $7 million. 
Bernini, considered the greatest sculptor of the Baroque Age, is best known for 
his work at the Vatican and his fountains in Rome. He made the 33-inch-tall 
portrait bust in 1621, when he was 23 and Alessandro Ludovisi was elected Pope 
Gregory XV. The sculpture is being sold by Toronto collectors and 
philanthropists Joseph and Toby Tanenbaum, who bought the piece in 1983.

OPRAH WINFREY IS BIG WINNER AT NAACP IMAGE AWARDS; 
</P>
<P>
AWARDS: ENTERTAINER SAMMY DAVIS JR. RECEIVES THE HALL OF FAME AWARD. 
</P>

Oprah Winfrey was crowned this year's unofficial queen of the black 
entertainment industry Saturday night at the NAACP Image Awards ceremony. 
However, a surprise shake-up amid ongoing discord in the civil rights 
association's host Beverly Hills-Hollywood chapter put a damper on the 
evening's celebration at the Wiltern Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Talk-show host, producer and actress Winfrey was named entertainer of the year 
and won three other Image Awards, given annually since 1967 by the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People to performers and shows that 
present fair images of blacks in the media. 
</P>
<P>
Winfrey also was honored for her work on "The Women of Brewster Place" and for 
the "No One Dies Alone" segment of "Prime Time Oprah." 
</P>
<P>
Almost overshadowing the awards was the sudden resignation of Willis Edwards, 
president of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood chapter of the NAACP for the last 
eight years. His replacement by the chapter's No. 2 officer, Sandra 
Evers-Manly, was announced in a one-page message inside the awards program. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said after the show that his decision to step down was not prompted by 
friction within his chapter -- reportedly in part over allegations he misused 
chapter funds and anger spurred by his ongoing pursuit of a $10-million libel 
lawsuit against entertainer Arsenio Hall -- or because of the national NAACP's 
move to assume control of the Image Awards this year. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the national organization, sidestepped 
questions about Edwards' departure. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening about 15 dissident members of the Beverly 
Hills-Hollywood branch of the NAACP, evidently unaware of Edwards' decision, 
carried placards in front of the Wiltern. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Watson, leader of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood branch protesters, said 
the chapter is out of touch with black community issues, citing the Image 
Awards fete as a prime example. 
</P>
<P>
"When they pay $100,000 for a tent with no heat and cold food, you know there's 
a problem in priorities," said Watson, who last year failed in an election bid 
to unseat Edwards. "You can pay all this for a party, but then you can't help 
enough children in L.A. Unified schools. They do the Image Awards once a year 
-- and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the show did go on, to a capacity crowd of 2,200, many of them 
paying $250 a seat to benefit the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's "A Different World" earned three awards: for an episode on date rape 
titled "No Means No"; for the performance of actor Kadeem Hardison in that 
episode; and for actress Jasmine Guy in the episode "For She's Only a Bird in a 
Gilded Cage." 
</P>
<P>
After winning her award, Guy commented on the tenuous avenues open to black 
actresses in film and TV. 
</P>
<P>
"I can do any role that a young woman can do," she said. "I don't think we 
(blacks) have got to the point where producers and Hollywood see us as just 
plain people. It always has to have black, and in front of my name it'll have 
young, black, light-skinned with long curly hair -- by that time there are no 
roles for me. It's very frustrating because I'm always starting over." 
</P>
<P>
Entertainer Sammy Davis Jr., his voice still raspy from throat-cancer surgery 
14 weeks ago, provided perhaps the ceremony's most poignant moment as he 
accepted the Hall of Fame Award. 
</P>
<P>
The Image Awards are to be televised Jan. 6 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Other award winners were: 
</P>
<P>

BIESANZ CONNECTS IN BARNSDALL PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can you remember the wonder you felt as a child when you first saw someone 
dance? Katja Biesanz can. Indeed, the dancing and choreography by this locally 
based young artist make the joy of movement something like a creative 
principle. 
</P>
<P>
At the Barnsdall Gallery Theatre on Friday, Biesanz and 11 other women brought 
a dimension of personal delight to their performances, as if the choreography 
represented a moment-by-moment discovery for them. 
</P>
<P>
This sense of personal connection made all the difference in modern dance 
miniatures lacking substantial movement invention (the whimsical "Chagall's 
Circus," originally a children's piece) or rooted in pantomime (the "Consuming 
Memory/Delta Dawn" solo about a picturesquely deranged Southern belle, or 
"Death Birds" with its winged, swooping corps). 
</P>
<P>
Other works tackled Big Themes and here Biesanz relied on imaginative gestural 
ideas along with a solid (if often obvious) sense of formal structure. The solo 
"Amazing Grace" sought to celebrate faith, the group showpieces "Rites of 
Mourning" and "BirthRites" explored formalized social responses to 
interpersonal milestones. 
</P>
<P>
In each, Biesanz created an intense image to physicalize her central concept -- 
without ever giving the movement leading to that statement major interest, much 
less spiritual depth. 
</P>
<P>
More successful: "Don Alfredo and the Dance of Death," a solo in which a switch 
of masks and dance styles suddenly defined the theme of mortality. 
</P>
<P>
The quintet "Celebration" also found Biesanz artfully introducing playful 
touches (such as the dancers lip-syncing the Bach accompaniment), along with 
the standard-issue balleticisms and limb-geometry of Baroque romps. LEWIS SEGAL

ASHKENAZY CONDUCTS PHILHARMONIC AT MUSIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We seem to be in the midst of a boom in pre-atonal Schoenberg, something 
apparent in the Los Angeles Philharmonic programming this season. Andre Previn 
returns in February for the monumental "Gurrelieder," while this weekend at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Vladimir Ashkenazy matched "Pelleas und Melisande" 
with some Sibelius. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1903, Schoenberg's "Pelleas und Melisande" is a long tone poem, 
almost obsessive in its programmatic depiction of Maeterlinck's play. It is 
generous in sentiment and overwhelming in orchestral display, and as 
fascinating in its audible roots as in its clear auguries of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
For all of that, it inspired more respect than affection Friday, in the first 
of two rare live performances. 
</P>
<P>
"Pelleas und Melisande" may be a piece of surging, portentous storytelling, but 
it is also a matter of articulated structure and dense instrumental polyphony. 
Ashkenazy did well by the big themes and gave clear cyclical definition to the 
form. 
</P>
<P>
But the textures he drew from the Philharmonic were impenetrable. Clarity is 
admittedly a relative concept in Schoenberg's morass of virulently multiplying 
motives, but Ashkenazy seemed to latch onto one main theme at a time, and leave 
the rest of the score an amorphous muttering. 
</P>
<P>
Balances were tilted in favor of the winds throughout. Even the central 
ecstasies sounded more clotted than rapturous. Only in the final passages of 
death and doom did the sound and fury take on real significance. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission, Ashkenazy began the Sibelius portion of the sololess 
program with the "Valse triste," from the same year as "Pelleas und Melisande." 
His account proved surprisingly lithe, with the emphasis more on the waltz than 
on the sadness and all the more affective thus. 
</P>
<P>
Working from memory in Sibelius' Fifth Symphony, Ashkenazy produced peaks of 
grandeur at the end of the opening movement and in the finale, and an 
affectionate Andante. But the calculated understatement of the beginning 
sounded simply inarticulate and disinterested, and the abrupt final chords 
fizzled badly. 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic efforts sounded more workmanlike than inspired or inspiring, 
despite noble individual and sectional solos in all works. The wind-dominated 
balances persisted in the Sibelius, and the violins added a sad measure of 
imprecision to the Scherzo scamperings.JOHN HENKEN

STRAUSS' 'FRAU' AT MET BEGINS TEXACO'S 50TH YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contrary to popular opinion, Texaco did not invent the Metropolitan Opera. The 
oil company did not even sponsor the first broadcast from the Met. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco has merely sponsored the last 49 years of broadcasts. Merely. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No other organization has ever provided remotely comparable support for a radio 
project. For nearly half a century, Texaco has altered the Saturday-afternoon 
habits, while possibly uplifting the aesthetic spirits, of a significant 
portion of the nation. All singing commercials should be that noble. 
</P>
<P>
For the first broadcast of the 50th season, the listener might have expected a 
gala performance of one of the all-time airwave hits -- "Aida," perhaps, or 
"Boheme" or "Traviata." One might have expected some glamorous new production 
with an all-star cast. It did not work out that way. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle on Saturday turned out to be Richard Strauss' sprawling and 
convoluted "Die Frau ohne Schatten," admittedly a festive choice but also a 
forbidding one. The production in question dates to 1966, the first Met season 
in the "new" house at Lincoln Center. The current cast, though solid, wasn't 
exactly par for a house that some stubborn optimists insist is the world's best 
-- a house, not incidentally, where a good seat costs $95. 
</P>
<P>
As a perverse fate would have it, the most celebrated participant didn't even 
show up. Bernd Weikl -- probably the foremost interpreter of Barak today -- 
withdrew earlier in the week. A spokesman explained that he had returned to 
Europe because of illness in his family. 
</P>
<P>
In the good old days, the Met would simply have drafted another equally 
seasoned, equally important singer from the German wing to serve as 
replacement. These days, the Met doesn't have another equally important singer 
on the roster for this assignment. It doesn't even have a German wing. 
</P>
<P>
So into the breach came James Courtney. Who, you might ask, is James Courtney? 
</P>
<P>
He is a bass from San Jose who has been singing minor roles with the company 
for a decade. In "Die Frau," he originally had been scheduled to undertake the 
fleeting contrapuntal squabbles of Barak's one-armed brother. 
</P>
<P>
The promotion to more imposing duties would seem warranted and overdue. 
Courtney obviously has not had an opportunity to explore -- much less learn to 
project -- the subtlety, the innate wisdom and good nature of the character. He 
does not yet color the words with much imagination. Like many a Barak before 
him, he cannot make an extended pianissimo climax of "Furchte dich nicht," 
arguably the most poignant phrase in the entire opera. Nevertheless, he saved 
the show and did so honorably. 
</P>
<P>
Courtney commands an incisive, wide-ranging, middleweight bass that survived 
the four-hour marathon with apparent ease. He held his own against the mighty 
orchestral competition, and performed with pervasive, sympathetic authority 
under trying conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The elemental heroes of the afternoon, however, could be found in the pit. 
Christof Perick conducted with urgency, grandeur and fine romantic breadth. He 
understands and savors the idiom. He also knows how to bring out the best in 
the superb Metropolitan Opera orchestra. The three women's roles, each 
incredibly arduous, were cast with canny Straussian veterans. Janis Martin, the 
most consistently successful, enacted the agonies and ecstasies of the Dyer's 
Wife with intelligent passion. Singing with stamina and amazing freshness, she 
remained unfazed by the high tessitura and resisted the obvious, treacherous 
temptation to force. 
</P>
<P>
Johanna Meier, a model Marschallin in the 1970s, was neither the steadiest nor 
most radiant Empress in memory. Still, she did have stylish savoir-faire in her 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
Helga Dernesch commands the right temperament, the right vocal color and the 
right dramatic force for the role of the evil Nurse. She is a resourceful, 
compelling artist. At this stage of her career, unfortunately, the range 
extremes impose severe strain, and she solves some problems in terms of 
omission rather than emission. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Schunk suffered Strauss' cruel demands upon the principal tenor 
stoically. Like most pretenders to this Emperor's dubious throne, he all but 
strangled on the dramatic outbursts, though he did meet the lyrical portions of 
the challenge competently. As the Messenger of Keikobad, Franz Mazura sounded 
as if he had fought one Wagnerian war too many. 
</P>
<P>
Nathaniel Merrill's staging scheme, now entrusted to Bruce Donnell, is firmly 
anchored on enlightened tradition. There can be no revelations here, but no 
unpleasant surprises either. 
</P>
<P>
Robert O'Hearn's fairyland decors toy incessantly with the stage machinery. 
Ornate sets rise and sink, turn and roll at the slightest provocation. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacle is still quaintly amusing. Too bad Strauss and his stern 
librettist, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, wanted it to be profoundly eloquent.

LORETTA YOUNG GRACES NBC'S 'LADY IN A CORNER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Lady in a Corner," at 9 tonight on Channels 4, 36 and 39, stars the all too 
rarely seen Loretta Young. That alone is enough to raise this predictable 
sudser to watchable heights. 
</P>
<P>
The 1947 Oscar winner (for "Farmer's Daughter") -- still smashing after a 
career that began in the silents, for Pete's sake -- plays Grace Guthrie, 
editor-in-chief of one of the nation's classiest fashion magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Her high standards are suddenly threatened by an ambitious young editor 
(Lindsay Frost) hired by the magazine's well-meaning, soon-to-retire owner 
(Brian Keith) and by the takeover bid of a sleazy London publisher (Christopher 
Neame). 
</P>
<P>
"There's an enormous difference between fashion and cheap sex," Grace icily 
asserts, and she sets out to defend truth, beauty and decency and to save the 
magazine from a fate worse than death. 
</P>
<P>
Adhering to time-honored soap style, Neame all but snarls to show his villainy 
in Allan Leicht's script, but Frost, an attractive, quirky and real presence, 
shades her character and manages to hold her own with Young -- no small task. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Peter Levin, the familiar plot is all great clothes and no 
surprises, but Young, on screen most of the two hours, is a marvel of feminine 
grace and steely strength. LYNNE HEFFLEY

NEW 'DINNER AT EIGHT' A STYLISH DELIGHT ON TNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1933 "Dinner at Eight" is such a cherished Hollywood classic that one can 
only approach a remake with trepidation. Yet TNT's new production, which 
premieres at 5 and repeats at 7 tonight, is a sparkling delight, thanks to an 
apt cast and especially to writer Tom Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
His updating is shrewd: His imaginative array of contemporary references 
underline what is timeless in playwrights George S. Kaufman's and Edna Ferber's 
observations of human nature. (Griffin was also able to draw upon the original 
screenplay by Frances Marion and Herman Mankiewicz, with additional dialogue by 
Donald Ogden Stewart.) 
</P>
<P>
The cast is such a pleasure that they deserve your attempt to try to forget who 
originally played their parts. Lauren Bacall sets the tone for the occasion 
with her elegance and sophistication. She is a glamorous, self-described trash 
novelist who has lived beyond her means. 
</P>
<P>
She is to be the most glittering of the guests invited by Marsha Mason, the 
social butterfly wife of New York shipping company owner John Mahoney, an old 
flame of Bacall's. Mahoney is a gentlemanly Establishment WASP whose 
100-years-plus family concern is threatened with a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every one of Mason's invitees is in the grip of some kind of crisis. 
Worst off is Harry Hamlin, playing an egotistical ex-TV series star wired on 
coke and hitting the skids hard. Mason and Mahoney haven't an inkling that 
their spoiled daughter (Stacy Edwards) is in love with him. Then there's 
Charles Durning's loud, coarse (and very shrewd) tycoon, who is at war with his 
flashy wife (Ellen Greene), who sees Mason's invitation as a longed-for chance 
for social acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Lagomarsino's direction is more theatrical than cinematic, and that suits 
the material and the medium just fine. Durning and especially Greene play 
broadly, but that's part of the fun. Mahoney emerges as a figure of dignity and 
sympathy, and Mason gets the chance to show us that the wife has some substance 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
This "Dinner at Eight" is a very stylish affair, with settings designed by Jame 
Osmann and costumes designed by Rita Ryack. It will encore Sunday at 1 p.m. and 
Dec. 21 at 5 p.m. KEVIN THOMAS

LIMIT ON BANK INVESTMENTS NOT EXPECTED TO FALL; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: A PROPOSAL TO REPEAL GLASS-STEAGALL GETS A MIXED REACTION. FEW BANKS IN 
CALIFORNIA ARE MOVING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BROADER POWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Banking's Berlin Wall is still a long way from coming down, even though it is 
showing new cracks. 
</P>
<P>
The barrier is the federal Glass-Steagall Act, which since 1933 has established 
a legal barrier prohibiting commercial banks from entering investment banking 
activities, such as underwriting stocks. The law, passed during the Great 
Depression amid fears that securities operations could cause banks to collapse, 
has long been criticized by banks as outdated. 
</P>
<P>
Despite advances made the past two years by banks taking advantage of softening 
regulations and an apparent weakening this month in opposition by the 
securities industry's trade group, few believe that the barrier will fall soon. 
What's more, it also is uncertain how interested banks are in getting into the 
securities business while it is so soft. 
</P>
<P>
Major New York money center banks, such as Bankers Trust, J. P. Morgan, Chase 
Manhattan, Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover, are leading the way and have 
been moving into areas allowed by banking regulators. 
</P>
<P>
On the West Coast, Security Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles has clearly been the 
most active, and its desire to expand into investment banking is clear, as 
evidenced by stakes that it owns in securities firms in London, Australia and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, few West Coast banks have made serious moves toward investment 
banking, mainly because federal regulations make it hard for all but the 
nation's largest banks to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent breakthrough came earlier this month when the Securities 
Industry Assn., the brokerage-industry trade group that has fought bank entry 
into the business in the past, adopted a position that would repeal 
Glass-Steagall in exchange for various privileges for brokerages, such as 
direct access to the Federal Reserve funds in a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers have criticized the proposal because, they say, it provides murky 
rights for banks and may include too many restrictions on their activities, 
such as curbs on making loans to companies that receive underwriting services 
from a bank's securities operation. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction was mixed as well among banks on the significance of the announcement. 
Some said it was significant if only because the association moved on the 
issue. Yet others disagree, saying that the proposal contains too many strings. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposal is nothing terribly novel," said Security Pacific Corp. Vice 
Chairman David R. Lovejoy. He argues that the proposal contains more 
restrictions than are already in place. 
</P>
<P>
Banking companies have been allowed some securities-related activity under 
Glass-Steagall, such as operating discount brokerages and underwriting 
government securities. 
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, regulators have chipped away at the law by allowing 
banks such expanded powers as underwriting commercial paper (which is a 
short-term IOU), securities backed by mortgages and, most recently, corporate 
debt. Next year, regulators are expected to grant the power to underwrite 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
There is a big catch. The operations must be set up in a subsidiary, and the 
newer powers granted in the past two years may make up only 10% of the unit's 
business. The rest must be in business long allowed under Glass-Steagall, such 
as underwriting U.S. government securities and general-obligation municipal 
bonds. In addition, there are barriers designed to put distance between a 
bank's securities and banking operations. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Loeser, senior vice president in the legal department for First 
Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, notes that the 10% restriction means that 
banks must do a huge business in the areas where they traditionally have been 
permitted to operate in order to generate any meaningful business. As a result, 
he said, the huge money center banks in New York, which are already active in 
such areas as government securities and municipal bonds, have been the primary 
ones to take advantage of the chipping away at the law. 
</P>
<P>
He said First Interstate has been inactive for several reasons, including the 
10% restriction and a change in its strategic direction, which has seen it 
restructure and emphasize such areas as consumer banking. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in California, BankAmerica in San Francisco also has been less active 
as it has gone through its recent turnaround and pushed harder into consumer 
banking. Wells Fargo has been relatively inactive, emphasizing consumer banking 
as well as real estate lending and financing leveraged buyouts, in which 
companies are purchased with large amounts of debt that is paid off with funds 
generated from operations or asset sales. 
</P>
<P>
Although relatively inactive for now, Union Bank, which is controlled by the 
Bank of Tokyo, ultimately is interested in investment banking, a bank spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lovejoy said one area that could be lucrative for banks if the restrictions 
fall is mortgage-backed securities. He notes that banks could underwrite 
securities backed by the billions of dollars in mortgages that they generate 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel J. Baptista, president of the Financial Services Council, a group of 
banks, brokerages and financial services firms that favors breaking down 
financial industry barriers, said it will take lengthy negotiations among 
banks, brokerages and insurance companies to reach agreements so that they 
enter each other's businesses.

INSURANCE: QUAKE VICTIMS WHO HAD COVERAGE ARE REBUILDING. 'NOW EVERYONE WANTS 
IT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SANTA CRUZ 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Within a week after the Oct. 17 earthquake, Jim Hoover had permits to tear down 
his heavily damaged home in the mountains above this hard-hit resort town, and 
he's already rebuilding on the rural site. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover credits a $100,000 payoff from earthquake insurance for sparing him and 
his wife, Gaye, from a financial catastrophe beyond the trauma of the quake 
itself. They added the coverage to their homeowners policy five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured that this is my investment in life," Hoover explained. So he 
protected it. 
</P>
<P>
Among earthquake victims, the Hoovers rate among the fortunate. But thousands 
of others -- even those with quake insurance -- find themselves saddled with 
big repair bills because their damages did not exceed the hefty 10% to 15% 
deductibles on their policies. And this has called into question the adequacy 
and cost of available quake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
An Assembly committee has called hearings on the subject starting next week, 
and the industry itself is pressing the federal government to take over quake 
insurance as it already has taken over flood insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of the insurance doesn't bother me; it's the deductible," said Megan 
Matthews, who owns a dozen properties around Santa Cruz County but carried 
earthquake insurance on only one. "If they changed that, more people would buy 
it and the cost would go down." 
</P>
<P>
Even insurance companies concede that the coverage is costly, but they insist 
that lowering the deductible would only increase the cost. Depending on a 
building's location and construction, earthquake insurance can cost $150 to 
$400 a year for $100,000 of coverage. However, damages must exceed the 10% to 
15% deductible before any benefits are paid -- in this case, $10,000 to 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the Hoovers' case, damage totaled $116,000, so they collected the full 
$100,000 that their State Farm policy provided. Hoover figures that it will 
cost him about $75,000 to rebuild; a carpenter by trade, he is doing much of 
the work himself. He has already spent $5,000 on demolition, and there will 
still be a double garage to replace. 
</P>
<P>
But for every Hoover with earthquake insurance, there are four other property 
owners in California without it. And even in the quake area, not all regret 
having avoided the extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
One of them is Joan Prsha, whose 95-year-old house over the Santa Cruz 
Mountains in Los Gatos slid off its packed-earth footing and has been 
condemned. The former Los Angeles resident bought the old house 27 years ago 
for $14,500. She declined earthquake coverage, reasoning that her home's 
destruction would not lessen the current value of the land that it occupied, 
which may be worth more than $300,000 today, house or no house. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of earthquake insurance, State Farm paid Prsha $1,492 under 
her homeowners policy for window damage and food loss, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleasantly surprised. They wrote me a check on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
Prsha said she has heard complaints from some property owners who felt ripped 
off by their insurance companies because damage, while substantial, did not 
exceed the deductible. 
</P>
<P>
"Earthquake insurance was never designed to be like homeowner coverage," Prsha 
said, explaining her own reasoning in declining it. "It's protection against 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Living now in a rented apartment, Prsha is considering whether to take 
advantage of a low-interest government loan to rebuild her house or sell the 
lot and buy another. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers Insurance agent John Allanson in Capitola agreed with Prsha's 
assessment, even though he personally suffered $25,000 in losses on two of four 
properties that he owns -- the two on which he carried no earthquake insurance. 
As soon as his company's 30-day moratorium on new sales in the stricken area 
ended, Allanson said he remedied that. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for client Gerald Shanahan, Allanson had been more persuasive with him. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan, a building developer and part-time jazz musician, collected the full 
$160,000 from his earthquake policy with Farmers after the quake damaged his 
ranch home in the Aptos hills. While his coverage carried a $16,000 deductible, 
the total damage, as determined by Farmers, exceeded $200,000 -- thus making 
him eligible for the policy's full amount. 
</P>
<P>
"As bad as the situation was, and could have been, it's turned out almost 
wonderful," Shanahan said. He shrugged off the loss of $4,500 in furnishings, 
which did not exceed the separate $5,200 deductible for contents that his 
policy required. 
</P>
<P>
"Something of that magnitude reorders your priorities," he said. "You get down 
to basics." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Gelfand, a Farmers vice president who heads the Los Angeles-based 
insurer's catastrophe headquarters in the Alameda County suburb of Pleasanton, 
said his customers seemed aware of the limitations of the coverage that they 
had bought. "You only hear about the exceptions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One that he heard of face to face was the complaint of a woman in Boulder 
Creek, a rural community in the Santa Cruz Mountains. She had declined 
earthquake insurance for the 15 years that she maintained a homeowners policy 
with Farmers, he said. As a result, the only insurance benefit the earthquake 
brought her was Farmers' check for $160 for broken glass, which qualified, he 
said, under her homeowners coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she knew she didn't have earthquake coverage but thought that, after 
15 years, she was entitled to something more," Gelfand said. 
</P>
<P>
That victim's plight underscored the reality of a wry observation made by State 
Farm agent Al Olseen in San Jose: "A 10% deductible is a lot better than a 100% 
deductible." 
</P>
<P>
Insurance claims adjusters, many brought in from other states, including those 
raked by Hurricane Hugo in September, provided damage estimates whether or not 
the clients had earthquake coverage. The clients were also directed to one of 
the two dozen emergency-aid centers set up in the quake area by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
FEMA coordinates disaster relief programs administered by a number of federal 
agencies, including the Small Business Administration, after the President 
declares an area to be an eligible disaster region because of the magnitude of 
damages. Aid includes temporary-housing allowances, grants of up to $10,000 and 
low-interest SBA loans of up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary industry estimate puts the net insured loss -- the amount of 
benefits paid by all types of insurance -- at about $1 billion, but the larger 
and more complex claims remain to be settled. In all, losses from the Oct. 17 
quake have already exceeded $7 billion -- the nation's most costly single 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jim Hoover hammers away on his rebuilt home above Santa Cruz. A few 
hundred yards away, David and Marsha Lewis have yet to pull down their tumbled, 
5-year-old house, which angles crazily down its hillside site. But throughout 
the earthquake area, property owners are beginning the costly job of cleaning 
up and strengthening their buildings for the next (and maybe bigger) quake. 
</P>
<P>
And sale of earthquake insurance? Farmers' district manager in San Francisco, 
Ron Hanisch, finds his agents' clients snapping up "earthquake insurance for 
whatever they can get. Now everyone wants it." 
</P>
<P>
Near Hanisch's office, where the turn-of-the-century homes on 10th Avenue are 
being shored up after having slipped off their foundations, Steven M. 
Kipperman, a nearby resident, said he still considers the $400 extra annual 
premium that he paid for $170,000 of earthquake insurance "cheap." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a heavy deductible, it's true," he said, "but it's nice to have the 
insurance there. This is a six-figure claim. I'm out of pocket, sure, but the 
drain on the pocket ended when it was supposed to end. 
</P>
<P>
"I happen to think the policies are a reasonable business deal and make sense," 
the lawyer said.

Across town in the Marina, renter Elizabeth Anne Burrie, who lived in an 
apartment on the top floor of a four-story building that she found collapsed 
onto North Point Street, prepares to get on with her life. 
</P>
<P>
Burrie lost her furniture, her car -- crushed in the first-floor parking area 
-- and her cat. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty depressed," she recalled, "and I didn't have earthquake 
insurance." But State Farm's claims adjuster received approval to pay her an 
unexpected $3,000 for glass damage to her possessions, ruling that the payment 
was covered under her tenants insurance. 
</P>
<P>
That helped finance immediate needs, Burrie said, and she has already found a 
new home, a garden apartment in -- of all places -- the Marina. The new 
building is stronger, she explained, and the disaster has made friends of 
neighbors whom she had never met nor scarcely recognized in passing during her 
14 years in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how many nice people there turned out to be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And she found her cat; it was living in the wreckage of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"She was probably waiting for me to come home," Burrie guessed.

Judge Rules Committee Can Be Replaced: A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled 
Wednesday that the city of Los Angeles has the right to abolish a Hollywood 
citizens advisory committee that had sought to continue its role after being 
replaced by the Los Angeles City Council in May. Judge Kurt J. Lewin ruled that 
the city was only required to consult with the Hollywood Project Area Committee 
for three years under state redevelopment law. An attorney for the Hollywood 
PAC said the group's members would continue to monitor redevelopment efforts in 
their neighborhood. (Filed June 2, 1989, Case No. C726300)

Employees May Buy Slice of Domino's: Domino's Pizza Inc. owner Tom Monaghan 
said Domino's has retained Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. 
to study the feasibility of an employee stock ownership plan. He said he will 
decide whether to implement an ESOP on completion of the study and will remain 
as chairman of Domino's if one is adopted. Under the ESOP, Domino's would 
borrow money, lend it to employees as a group to buy a majority share in the 
company and distribute stock to employees as a benefit redeemable as the loan 
is paid off.

MEMO: TREE FARMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Only about 1.2 million Christmas trees are grown in California each year, which 
represents about 25% of the statewide market for live trees, according to the 
California Christmas Tree Growers, a trade group based in Alamo. Oregon and 
Washington, by comparison, grow about 5 million trees each, and together supply 
about 25% to 30% of the nation's trees. 
</P>
<P>
The most common Christmas tree grown on California's choose-and-cut farms is 
the Monterey Pine, a native of California's Monterey Peninsula, according to 
the growers association. It isn't generally available on retail lots, according 
to industry sources. It has a deep green color, needles four to five inches 
long and a strong pine fragrance. Growers say it is a fast-growing tree that 
takes four to five years to reach harvest size and is among the longest-lasting 
trees when the stem is recut and the tree is kept in water. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular tree found on retail lots is the plantation-grown Douglas fir. 
Most sold in California come from the Pacific Northwest, but the tree also 
grows in the colder, moister regions of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The highest-priced tree found on California retail lots is the Silvertip or Red 
fir, which grows only in high elevations and takes 12 or more years to reach 
harvest size. The species is available on choose-and-cut farms in the Sierras. 
</P>
<P>
The growers association projects an average tree price this season of $23.65, 
or about the same as last season. Some choose-and-cut farms charge by the foot 
-- in some cases about $5 per foot. Trees are available as tall as 12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to pests, tree farms have to worry about thieves who sneak in a 
night and help themselves. Federal officials have come up with a creative 
deterrent to pilfering trees from public lands. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, trees have been sprayed with a compound that is odorless and 
colorless, but produces a horrible smell hours after the tree is cut. It smells 
"something like a reindeer that's been dead in the living room for a few 
weeks," said an official interviewed recently on National Public Radio's 
Morning Edition news program. LINDA WILLIAMS

TREE FARMS: SOME SERIOUS GROWERS AND HOBBYISTS ARE KEEPING THE INDUSTRY GOING

Urban life is encroaching on Bob and Lorie Sturrock's Christmas tree farm on 
San Dimas Canyon Road in San Dimas. Busy Foothill Boulevard nearby is a 
constant reminder. Of late, a couple of developers have come calling to state 
the obvious -- the land is a lot more valuable for planting houses than trees. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far the Sturrocks have not been moved. "We live here on the farm. It's 
pretty nice to have our own piece of green here," Lorie Sturrock said recently. 
Moreover, it is her career. She runs the farm year-round while Bob tends to his 
job selling thread to the garment industry. He helps out in his spare time, and 
most of the 12 children and 22 grandchildren pop up from time to time during 
the busy Christmas season to help with customers. 
</P>
<P>
For the 28th year in a row it is business as usual for the Sturrocks who -- 
within just a few weeks -- get to see if the labor that they put in all year 
pays off. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 other growers in California have been going through some of the same 
routines since Thanksgiving. While the vast majority of trees sold in 
California are grown elsewhere, a small group of serious growers and part-time 
hobbyists have kept a farming industry going in California for generations. 
</P>
<P>
California's contribution to the nation's industry is the "choose-and-cut" 
farm, a marketing innovation begun in the Santa Cruz mountains more than 40 
years ago, according to the tree growers association. The farms allow consumers 
to select and cut their own trees or tag a tree for farm workers to cut for 
later pickup. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more California consumers have become enamored with the idea 
of choosing their trees directly from the source, according to the trade group. 
This year, the association estimates, more than a million Californians will cut 
their own trees. 
</P>
<P>
Mike and Dawn Hansen of Lakewood were on their first visit to a Christmas tree 
farm on a recent warm afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we saw one at our neighbor's house," Dawn Hansen said while 
searching the Lakewood Pines farm in Lakewood. "We thought it was so nice, so 
we decided we would get one this year." 
</P>
<P>
Urbanites don't always have to travel great distances to cut trees. Dozens of 
farms operate close to housing developments and shopping centers in Southern 
California. Many are on public utility rights of way. They are able to lease 
the transmission line corridors because no buildings are allowed near the power 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Those locations are the only economical sites for growing trees in Southern 
California because land that can be developed for buildings commands premium 
prices, said Bob Jones, president of the tree growers association. "There's no 
way you can buy land in that location and grow Christmas trees," said Jones, 
who operates a 150-acre wholesale tree farm and three smaller choose-and-cut 
farms in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Sturrocks are among the few in Southern California who own their 14 acres, 
but the land was bought in 1961 before land prices skyrocketed. They have about 
12,000 trees on seven of the acres, Lorie Sturrock said. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of growers in Southern California have sold out to developers over the 
years, said Rich DeRosa, who leases public land near power lines for his Grand 
Avenue Tree Farm in Glendora. DeRosa, a high school social studies teacher, is 
typical of many in the industry who turned to tree farming for extra income. He 
says he got the idea from a friend he met at a high school reunion in 1979 who 
was a gardener selling trees on the side. 
</P>
<P>
DeRosa said he attended lots of seminars sponsored by the tree growers 
association. "We were warned that it wouldn't be easy," he said. "Weeds grow 
all the time. They have to be (removed by hand). There are pine top moths, and 
other pests are a constant problem. Water lines break -- fun things like that. 
Trees aren't terribly easy to grow. It takes a lot of time. We spend about 
$2,000 a year on this farm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Heyne, who operates three farms with partners, can attest to the threat of 
pests. "We fumigated this whole area," Heyne said recently, pointing to a large 
section of their 8-acre Lakewood Pines farm. "We had a lot of trouble with 
yellowing. We brought out the county agricultural agent who advised us to 
fumigate," he said. The problem turned out to be fungus and the nematode, a 
common plant parasite, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For their labors -- which include constant irrigation and continuous delicate 
trimming of trees to produce the most attractive conical shape -- and a 
substantial up-front cash outlay, beginning growers won't have a marketable 
crop for at least three to four years. The time that it takes to grow a tree 
depends on the species and whether you begin with seeds or seedlings, growers 
said. And growers have to carefully calculate the number of trees to plant per 
acre (allowing for a certain number of trees that will be lost to pests and 
other causes) to make the operation economical. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, growers tend to plant more trees per acre because their 
land costs are higher, said Sharon Burke, executive director of the tree 
growers association. But one can plant trees only so close together, Heyne 
said. "Our trees are planted on a diagonal that is 4 1/2 feet across between 
trees," he said. Heyne said he normally has about 1,200 to 1,500 trees per 
acre. 
</P>
<P>
Growing trees has its rewards, said DeRosa. "I always have a tan and I'm sure 
it's helped me to be healthy. I get a lot of exercise," he quips. But farming 
hasn't yet produced a financial windfall, he said. Nevertheless, DeRosa said he 
and a partner are investing proceeds from the Grand Avenue farm into another 
operation in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing is key for choose-and-cut farms that compete with a variety of 
conveniently located retail Christmas tree lots and nurseries, and most 
recently grocers and other chain stores. Although chain stores are new to the 
market, the tree growers association said they have grabbed a big part of the 
market in a few short years. Some retail lots offer extra services like 
flocking and flame retarding. 
</P>
<P>
Competition is tough because "there's an oversupply of Christmas trees in the 
lower grades," said Jones. But growers who have premium trees have a "pretty 
firm market," he added. "People who have the worst ups and downs are those that 
usually have a bad location," he said.

A PRIMER ON EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: What is earthquake insurance? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Earthquake insurance is an amendment added to homeowner policies, which 
normally exclude earthquakes as a covered risk. The amendment, or "rider," 
costs $150 to $400 a year for $100,000 of coverage, and it typically is 
available in amounts ranging from $100,000 to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, the benefit is paid only after earthquake damages exceed 10% to 15% of 
the insured amount, not the damage total. In other words, a 10% deductible 
means that damages must exceed $10,000 under a $100,000 policy before benefits 
are paid. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is my homeowner policy worthless in a quake without the extra coverage? 
</P>
<P>
A: That depends on the insurer and the policy. While an earthquake is typically 
excluded as a covered peril, a fire started because of earthquake damage -- 
rupture of a gas main, for example -- would be covered. In the Oct. 17 quake, 
some companies' claims adjusters, who determine the insured loss, authorized 
payment for such things as broken windows and ruined carpeting under the 
homeowner policy even though there was no additional earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What other insurance may apply? 
</P>
<P>
A: Earthquake victims hurt on the job may be eligible under workers' 
compensation insurance. Crushed or damaged cars are covered by the 
"comprehensive" portion of auto insurance. Lost business income is covered by 
business-interruption insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is earthquake insurance available to renters? 
</P>
<P>
A: Generally, the earthquake amendment can be added to renters insurance on 
furnishings, clothes and other personal property. 
</P>
<P>
Western Insurance Information Service in Tustin offers the following criteria 
to help property owners and renters evaluate their risk in deciding on 
earthquake insurance: 
</P>
<P>
* How close are you to an active fault? 
</P>
<P>
* Is your home built on solid bedrock, a steep hill where it might slip off the 
foundation or on fill such as in San Francisco's Marina district? 
</P>
<P>
* What type of construction? Wood-frame is least costly ($2 to $4 per $1,000, 
depending on company and location), brick veneer and masonry buildings are more 
costly to insure. 
</P>
<P>
* How tall is the building? 
</P>
<P>
* Is the building firmly anchored to its foundation or footings? 
</P>
<P>
* Check prices and terms with several companies. 
</P>
<P>
The information service offers the following toll-free number for consumers 
with questions about insurance: 800-397-1679.

MARCHING ORDERS ON AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an emergency letter to the White House, the National Commission on Acquired 
Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has opened a campaign to persuade American 
leaders "to match rhetoric with action" in containing the dreadful epidemic. 
The report is a most timely nudge for President Bush to provide national 
leadership on this critical problem. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a dangerous, perhaps even growing, complacency in our country toward 
an epidemic that many people want to believe is over," commissioners found. 
"Far from over, the epidemic is reaching crisis proportions among the young, 
the poor, women and many minority communities. In fact, the 1990s will be much 
worse that the 1980s." Two urgent tasks for President Bush emerge from the 
report: Creating a national plan for responding to the epidemic and moving 
quickly to stem the alarming spread among intravenous drug users of the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no national plan for helping an already faltering health care system 
deal with the impact of the HIV epidemic," according to the report. And the 
search for solutions has been made no easier by the fact that the President's 
National Drug Control Strategy virtually ignores the rapid spread of HIV 
infection among intravenous drug users. Commissioners expressed understandable 
"surprise and disappointment" regarding those omissions. 
</P>
<P>
The report, while directed to President Bush, makes clear that an effective 
campaign against AIDS will require the cooperation and work of leaders at all 
levels of government and within the private sector. Furthermore, the report 
realistically acknowledges that "the health care system itself requires urgent 
attention." AIDS is not the cause of the unraveling of health services and, at 
worst, will not itself take more than about 4% of health-care funding. But no 
region is without problems as the epidemic spreads throughout the nation. Some 
areas, notably New York City, already are so heavily impacted that the health- 
care system itself is imperiled. 
</P>
<P>
For us, there are two contrasting conclusions to be drawn from the report: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The report underscores once again that there is a consensus among the 
professionals about what needs to be done. Like the report prepared 18 months 
ago by the Presidential Commission headed by Adm. James D. Watkins, this report 
identifies key areas of action and the increased funding necessary if the 
essential programs are to be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 -- But the report also reflects the inertia of too many leaders in 
implementing these clear and urgent recommendations. That is particularly 
evident regarding the call for mobilizing an adequate national drug 
rehabilitation program, something the Watkins panel cited as essential even 
before it wrote its final report in June of 1988. Education and on-demand drug 
rehabilitation are the only known means to respond to this growing problem 
which "imperils not only the drug users but also their sexual partners and 
children." 
</P>
<P>
No report was due from the commission until August, but members felt the need 
for "extraordinary measures" required an earlier response from them, a quicker 
mobilization of the nation. We agree. And we look now to President Bush, with 
confidence encouraged by his past statements on the epidemic, for vigorous 
leadership.

Gusty desert winds whipsawed Orange County today, ripping signs off their posts 
and interrupting power to at least 16,600 homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Gusts up to 37 m.p.h. turned Christmas tree lots into swirling masses of pine 
needles and sawdust. The powerful winds prompted the Orange County Fire 
Department to call a "red flag alert," an extra-high state of readiness to 
protect against the threat of wind-whipped fire. 
</P>
<P>
The winds blew a steady 23 m.p.h. at John Wayne Airport with occasional gusts 
to 35 m.p.h., the National Weather Service said. At the Marine Corps Air 
Station-El Toro, winds gusted to 37 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"It will decrease tomorrow and start up again Wednesday through Friday," said 
National Weather Service spokeswoman Pat Rowe. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison crews were kept busy trying to restore electrical 
service during the morning. Spokesman Steve Nelson said most of the outages 
lasted about half a minute as branches briefly crossed power lines. But 6,400 
homes, he said, were affected for up to two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Most (of the outages) are tree-caused," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the outages interrupted power at the complex of county buildings in 
Santa Ana. County Public Information Officer Helen Lotos said auxiliary 
generators kicked in immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Operations were reported normal at John Wayne Airport except that airliners 
were taking off in an inland direction rather than ascending over the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists were holding up well under the buffeting of wind gusts. The 
California Highway Patrol reported no wind-related troubles. Blowing sand and 
dust, however, limited visibility to about a mile on the Riverside Freeway in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Several Christmas tree lots were hard hit. Among them was the Target Store's 
lot on Adams Avenue in Huntington Beach, where most of the 3,000 trees were 
blown over at about 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Just about our entire group of trees got nailed," said Robert Barba, a garden 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
Workers were setting up the trees, this time with rope and nets because the 
winds remained fierce, Barba said. 
</P>
<P>
The lot had minor damage and about $100 worth of cactus and potted plants 
"really got thrashed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parent volunteers at a Boy Scout lot on 17th Street and Newport Boulevard in 
Tustin anticipated the winds last night and set the trees on their sides. 
</P>
<P>
"We kicked them all over so they wouldn't get damaged," said one parent who 
declined to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
Still, parents were bothered by blowing sawdust this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the sawdust blowing, but our customers are our biggest problem," the 
parent said. "It's just blowing in our faces." 
</P>
<P>
Target Store's lot on West Lincoln Avenue in Anaheim was closed this morning 
because of the wind. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just hard to see," said a Target clerk who declined to give her name. 
"Needles were blowing everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Damage wasn't limited to cut trees. Santa Ana's Public Works Department had 
crews out this morning to clean up after about 15 trees that were blown down in 
the city.

A San Mateo man who gave a Fresno radio program director cocaine in exchange 
for playing certain records was sentenced in federal court in Los Angeles today 
to 60 days in a halfway house and fined $100,000 for the payola scheme. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer also ordered Ralph Tashjian, 41, to 
perform 500 hours of community service and serve three years probation after 
his release.

<P>
Rymer said she had intended to impose a stiffer sentence on Tashjian, who is 
the first person convicted under the federal payola law amended in 1960. But 
she said she changed her mind after Department of Justice attorney Drew Pitt 
declined to seek a specific term.

WINDS RAKE SOUTHLAND BUT MOSTLY SPARE LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana winds whipped through the Southland early this morning, causing havoc 
on San Bernardino freeways, flooding some Orange County coastal highway areas 
and blowing down power lines, but for the most part sparing metropolitan Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The cold desert winds, which at times gusted to 80 m.p.h., created dark 
swirling dust on some Inland Empire freeways, blinded motorists, flipped trucks 
and pushed small cars about like toys, California Highway Patrol officials 
said. More than two dozen traffic accidents were reported; however, there were 
no reports of serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The winds are expected to continue throughout the day and possibly worsen 
tonight and early Tuesday, according to weather forecasters. Wind advisories 
remain in effect for trailer rigs and other high-profile vehicles on freeways 
and major highways from the western edge of the Inland Empire east to Blythe 
near the Arizona border. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officials said the winds were among the strongest they have seen this 
season and predicted that the travel advisories will remain in effect until at 
least Tuesday morning. The 80 m.p.h. gust was reported in the Laguna Peak area 
near Point Magu in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful winds made this morning's commute a nightmare for motorists in the 
Inland Empire, where portions of three freeways were closed by dangerous dust 
clouds that cut visibility. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic is heavy, the visibility is poor and down to zero in some 
stretches," CHP Officer Marty Bell said in San Bernardino. "It's best to just 
stay out of the area altogether if possible." 
</P>
<P>
By noon, the CHP reported that 15 trailer rigs had been toppled by the heavy 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
One unidentified driver received scrapes and bruises after the wind tipped his 
truck rig onto its side. One highway patrol officer reported that the wind blew 
out the back window of his patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
A part of California 60 was closed to all traffic due to blowing sand and 
sudden gusts, while Interstate 15 was closed from Baseline Road east to the 
community of Devore. A section of Interstate 10 near the Ontario Airport in 
western San Bernardino County was also closed. 
</P>
<P>
The southbound lanes of Interstate 15 near Devore were closed for several hours 
because of the vicious wind gusts funneling through Cajon Pass. 
</P>
<P>
Exacerbating the difficult driving conditions were swirling leaves and small 
branches torn from trees. Sand, dust and small rocks also pelted windshields in 
some areas and caused a giant brown cloud to form over much of the region by 
mid-morning. 
</P>
<P>
Another round of gusty desert winds whipsawed Orange County, ripping signs off 
their posts and interrupting power to at least 16,600 homes and businesses. 
Several areas of the Pacific Coast Highway were temporarily flooded by 
wind-thrown waves coming off the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful winds prompted the Orange County Fire Department to call a "red 
flag alert," an extra high state of readiness to protect against threat of 
wind-whipped fire. 
</P>
<P>
The winds blew a steady 23 m.p.h. at John Wayne Airport with occasional gusts 
to 35 m.p.h., the National Weather Service reported. They were even higher at 
the Marine Corps Air Station in El Toro where gusts as high as 37 m.p.h. were 
reported.

EAST EUROPE: PARTY LEADER ANNOUNCES END TO COMMUNISTS' AUTOMATIC RIGHT TO RULE.

SOFIA, Bulgaria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bulgarian leader Petar Mladenov today promised free elections by June and an 
end to the Communist Party's automatic right to rule. 
</P>
<P>
"We propose that the National Assembly organize new, free democratic elections 
by the end of May," Mladenov told a meeting of the party's decision-making 
Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the party's guaranteed leading role in society is being scrapped. 
"The leading role of the party cannot be declared administratively but must 
come from the trust of the people." 
</P>
<P>
A Communist Party spokesman told a news conference that the party is proposing 
to the National Assembly that the article of the constitution guaranteeing the 
party's monopoly on power should be scrapped and a new constitution drawn up by 
the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov's announcement at a session of the party's leadership followed similar 
moves by the East German and Czechoslovak parties to surrender their absolute 
grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
It followed a four-week whirlwind of political change in this Balkan country of 
9 million, culminating in a pro-democracy rally Sunday in Sofia that drew tens 
of thousands of people to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov, a former foreign minister who took over from veteran hard-liner Todor 
Zhivkov last month, also proposed a dialogue "with all powers of society that 
work on the basis of socialism and patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
But it was not immediately clear whether this dialogue would involve opposition 
groups that have demanded round-table talks on the future of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov, whose speech to the policy-making Central Committee was carried by 
Bulgarian radio, said the party will also hold an extraordinary congress of 
grass-roots party members next March. This seemed likely to vote in a more 
reformist Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov also proposed that the Parliament on Thursday vote to set up a 
commission to investigate allegations of corruption during the 35-year rule of 
the now disgraced Zhivkov. 
</P>
<P>
While the party Central Committee met to hear Mladenov, a Sofia court 
registered Eco-Glasnost, an ecological group, as Bulgaria's first independent 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Early elections in Bulgaria, which up until a few weeks ago was a fortress of 
Stalinism, are likely to favor the Communists; the growing number of 
still-unregistered political, religious and ecological groups were banned until 
recently and have had little time to establish themselves. 
</P>
<P>
As the Central Committee plenary meeting continued in closed session, about 
12,000 Bulgarians massed in freezing darkness near party headquarters to hold a 
silent candlelight vigil in support of opposition demands for further political 
change.

Soldiers with trucks, machine shovels and wire cutters toiled in freezing 
weather today as Czechoslovakia started to dismantle part of its "Iron Curtain" 
frontier with the West. 
</P>
<P>
Work on a five-mile section along the confluence of the Morava and Danube 
rivers dividing Czechoslovakia from Austria began at 7 a.m., the commander of a 
border guard unit said. 
</P>
<P>
"The damned thing is going at last," said a member of the army engineering unit 
engaged in the work. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia announced Nov. 30 that it would dismantle barriers on its 
240-mile southern frontier. 
</P>
<P>
In Prague, a joyous cacophony of bells and whistles today heralded a popular 
victory over the Communists, and Czechoslovaks settled down to choosing a new 
president to replace Gustav Husak, who resigned last week. Parliament, which 
meets Tuesday, has two weeks to elect a president, but the choice could be made 
in days.

Radical groups in Estonia and Latvia demanding a return to their Baltic

local elections. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results today in the Estonian capital of Tallinn showed a 12-member 
radical alliance had picked up 18 of the 80 City Council seats after preference 
votes were counted and was likely to win at least 40 when the final tally was 
calculated. Among the 18 was a member of the environmentalist Greens Party. 
</P>

A complex preferential voting system means the full outcome will not be known 
for several days.

An Air Force Delta 2 rocket knifed through a blue sky today and successfully 
boosted into orbit a $65-million "Navstar" satellite, the fifth in a 
globe-spanning network of military navigation beacons. 
</P>
<P>
Running 24 hours behind schedule, the $30-million Delta 2, equipped with nine 
strap-on boosters for extra power, thundered to life at 1:10 p.m., 16 minutes 
late because of concern about high winds aloft, and quickly vaulted away from 
Launch Pad 17 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. 
</P>

Housed inside a protective nose cone at the top of the 126-foot rocket was the

COLUMBIA S&amp;L CHIEF SPIEGEL OUT AT YEAR END

<TEXT>
<P>
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. chief Thomas Spiegel said today he would quit 
as chairman and chief executive on Dec. 31, blaming the collapsing junk bond 
market that has sent the Beverly Hills-based thrift reeling. 
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Spiegel, a former Wall Street trader, Columbia had 
invested more heavily than any other thrift in junk bonds, and turned big 
profits on them until recently. Its assets zoomed from $400 million in 1974 to 
more than $13 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would become a consultant to Columbia, devoting all his time to 
creating a subsidiary into which the high-yield, high-risk securities can be 
spun off, and allowing a new leader to recreate Columbia as a more traditional 
lender. 
</P>
<P>
Under new laws, thrifts can invest in junk bonds only through separately 
capitalized affiliates rather than using government-insured deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia also said that because of problems with those investments, it will be 
unable to meet the tougher requirements for risk-based capital contained in the 
thrift bailout bill signed in August by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel, who was paid $5.6 million in 1987 and $4.1 million last year, said the 
soured junk-bond market made his full-time attention to creating the new 
subsidiary a matter of urgency. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia said it already had begun interviewing potential successors. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel, a friend of junk bond wizard Michael Milken, angered federal thrift 
regulators for years by amassing Columbia's huge portfolio of junk bonds. He 
also is known for his close ties to political figures, and set up the junk bond 
investment for former House Majority Whip Tony Coelho that forced the Democrat 
to resign last May.

NEW JAPANESE STOCK SCANDAL PROBE STARTS

Major brokerage Daiwa Securities is under investigation by Japan's Finance 
Ministry for allegedly violating securities law in what appears to be another 
Japanese stock scandal. 
</P>
<P>
When stock recommendations went sour, Daiwa allegedly offered its favored 
corporate clients special stock deals that guaranteed illegal profits to make 
up for losses. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has opened an investigation of Daiwa's alleged loss-free 
transactions, which violate Japan's Securities and Exchange Law. 
</P>
<P>
Daiwa officials said today that the company did cover losses of 20 to 30 
customers totaling about 10 billion yen ($69.4 million), but these were not 
guaranteed loss-free deals. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Daiwa had not promised any compensation for loss to the 
customers but decided to cover some to maintain good relations. 
</P>
<P>
The Daiwa scandal is the latest load of the stock market's dirty laundry the 
media have hung out for the public to see. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, police arrested a Nomura Securities employee and a Kawasaki city 
employee. The Nomura employee is suspected of selling pre-listed stock to the 
Kawasaki official in return for managing a larger share of the city's pension 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
But at the top of the list was the Recruit affair, the worst postwar political 
scandal. A number of politicians reaped large profits by buying stock in a real 
estate unit of Recruit Co. before the shares were listed and then selling the 
stock after it started trading on the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
General elections are expected in February and -- if not hushed up -- the Daiwa 
affair may be taken as yet another symbol of Japan's elite doing favors for one 
another, with the ruling party looking on benignly, if not actually part of the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing the Finance Ministry wants in pre-election times, when people 
are still goosey about Recruit and minor scandals, is to create more of a stink 
than they have to," a veteran analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers say loss-free trades abound because they are difficult to prove and 
because stock regulations in Japan are often loosely enforced.

AT&amp;T PLANS TO TRIM ANOTHER 8,500 JOBS FROM FORCE IN 1990

<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. plans to trim another 8,500 jobs from 
its work force in 1990 after cutting about 25,000 this year, the company 
confirmed today. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T spokesman Walter G. Murphy said the company has been planning next 
year's reductions for some time and has already notified employees. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in the departments that are affected by the job reductions planned 
for 1990 have been informed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported the cuts in today's editions and quoted 
unidentified sources as saying that they could be part of a wider work force 
reduction campaign in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy declined to characterize the reductions or to comment on how sweeping 
they would be. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 1990 reductions will occur in AT&amp;T's Network Services division, 
which has 37,600 workers and runs AT&amp;T's long-distance network, Murphy 
said. Employees were told on Nov. 28 of plans to reduce the division staff by 
6,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the company plans to cut 700 jobs in its Business Communications 
Systems unit, 1,400 jobs in its Material Management &amp; Service unit and 400 
jobs in its General Business Systems division in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Business Communications Systems unit, which supplies office phone services 
to big businesses, has 15,000 workers while the General Business Systems 
division, which handles phone service for smaller companies, has 11,200 
workers. Material Management &amp; Services has 8,700 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said advances in technology have been behind much of the job cutting at 
AT&amp;T. The company envisioned thousands of cuts as it upgrades its 
long-distance phone network to a more efficient digital system by the end of 
next year, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
The big communications company has intensified its efforts to streamline 
operations lately by automating factories and back-office facilities and by 
breaking itself down into smaller, more focused units. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T has almost frozen hiring and has instead redeployed existing staff 
into vacant positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on a drive to right-size this place to be competitive," Harold W. 
Burlingame, vice president of human resources at AT&amp;T, told the Journal. 
"Our managers are quickly learning that they must focus on costs, customers and 
competitors." 
</P>
<P>
Most of this year's cuts have come through early retirement or attrition, but 
several thousand have come through unannounced cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984 when the company divested its regional operating companies, AT&amp;T 
has cut about 90,000 jobs. The company will have a payroll of about 280,000 
employees by January.

A 15-year-old girl testified that she was raped by three crew members for LL 
Cool J while as many as eight members of the rap singer's band stood by 
watching. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, who said she never saw LL Cool J, said the singer's bodyguard lured 
her to his hotel room in suburban Bloomington with promises of meeting the star 
and then began sexually assaulting her there. 
</P>
<P>
She testified in Hennepin County District Court at the opening of the trial 
last week of bodyguard Christopher Tsipouras, 22, of Union, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Tsipouras is charged with two counts of first-degree sexual assault stemming 
from the alleged attack Aug. 10 following a concert by the popular rap band at 
Metropolitan Sports Center in Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
The girl testified that she and a 16-year-old friend had won tickets and 
backstage passes to the Aug. 9 concert from a radio station. But when it was 
time to go backstage, the station's representative was late. Tsipouras then 
stepped in with an offer to meet LL Cool J, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Tsipouras' attorney, James Grochal, suggested that 
the girl had been wearing suggestive clothing and knew she was going to have 
sex when she went to the hotel.

From People magazine with love, soon-to-be-sexagenarian Sean Connery is the 
"Sexiest Man Alive, 1989." 
</P>
<P>
"For once, I'm speechless," Connery said after being informed of the honor. 
"It'll all be downhill from here." 
</P>
<P>
He joins the ranks of John F. Kennedy Jr., 1988; Harry Hamlin, 1987; Mark 
Harmon, 1986; and Mel Gibson, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"He was sexy at 26, and at 60 even more so," actress Shelley Winters said of 
Connery, whom she dated during the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes a woman feel sexual chemistry. To be his leading lady, I'd lose 50 
pounds and get my face lifted. As a matter of fact, I'd get everything lifted." 
</P>
<P>
Connery's movie roles include James Bond. More recently, he starred in "The 
Untouchables," for which he won an Oscar; in the summer hit, "Indiana Jones and 
the Last Crusade," and in the new release, "Family Business." 
</P>
<P>
Connery was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on Aug. 25, 1930.

BUSEY PLEASES HELMET GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Gary Busey's apparent turnaround on the use of motorcycle helmets -- he 
now advocates wearing them -- has delighted the Motorcycle Safety Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Busey, who suffered a severe head injury a year ago when his motorcycle struck 
a curb in Culver City, had in the months following the accident insisted on his 
right not to wear head protection while biking. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, before the accident, Busey and others helped defeat a proposed state 
law forcing motorcycle riders to wear helmets. 
</P>
<P>
But during a Nov. 28 appearance on television's syndicated "Arsenio Hall Show," 
Busey told his host he had a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a whole new attitude about helmeting . . . my attitude now is becoming 
helmet-conscious, to wear one," Busey said. The actor, who needed 
rehabilitation to recover from his injury, said he had reflected on the 
accident and on the safety of young riders. 
</P>
<P>
"Next time you're doing 45 m.p.h., look at the curb and think about 
slam-dancing with it once, and you'll start thinking about helmets," Busey said 
on the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Busey's comments on the 'Arsenio Hall Show' put to rest any doubts about his 
position on helmet use," said Irvine-based Motorcycle Safety Foundation 
President Alan Isley. 
</P>
<P>
Busey didn't say if he would go as far as recommending a helmet law.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: FDA AWARDS GENERIC DRUGS A 99% CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON and DR. TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dust is slowly starting to settle on the generic drug scandal. The Food and 
Drug Administration has completed a preliminary survey of top-selling generic 
medications and found that 99% were fine. 
</P>
<P>
The news came as a tremendous relief for Henry. His father and grandfather both 
died of heart attacks at an early age. His own blood pressure is high and his 
cholesterol is elevated. To control these health threats, Henry takes Calan and 
Lasix for hypertension and Nicobid for cholesterol control. 
</P>
<P>
Before questions were raised about the safety and effectiveness of generic 
drugs, Henry's monthly bill was $37. But Henry got scared after reading the 
headlines, and had his pharmacist fill his prescriptions with only brand names. 
His bill soared to over $175. 
</P>
<P>
This was a hardship for Henry and his wife, but like millions of other 
Americans, he didn't want to risk his health on dubious generic drugs. Now, 
Henry should be reassured that the vast majority of generic drugs meet federal 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Answering the question, "Are the generic drugs on the market safe and 
effective?" FDA Commissioner Dr. Frank Young recently responded, "The answer 
appears to be a qualified yes." 
</P>
<P>
The FDA's conclusion was reached after examining 30 of the most widely used 
generics, medicines like hydrochlorothiazide, prednisone, antibiotics such as 
amoxicillin, cephalexin and erythromycin, pain-relievers containing 
acetaminophen and codeine or propoxyphene, and many others. 
</P>
<P>
The tests considered whether these generic medications were indeed chemically 
identical to their brand-name counterparts; if the active ingredients were as 
strong as those in the brand-name medicines, and if the pills dissolved 
properly -- a short-cut to determining if these medicines get into the 
bloodstream as they should. 
</P>
<P>
The results show that in most cases generic drugs are as good as brand-name 
medications. Drugs that flunk the tests are being withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
The generic drug mess was brought to light as a result of whistle-blowing from 
within the industry itself. One of the major manufacturers of generic products 
felt that FDA officials had shown favoritism to its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the feds have cracked down, physicians, pharmacists and patients 
should return to using generic drugs with confidence. The savings are too 
important to ignore.

Joe Cloutier, president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, died today at his 
home. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
Cloutier, Speedway vice president since Tony Hulman purchased the decaying 
track at the end of World War II, was named president when Hulman died in 1977. 
He stepped down when John Cooper was appointed president in 1980 and was named 
president again when Cooper resigned two years later. 
</P>
<P>
Cloutier began his association with the Hulman family as a cashier with its 
wholesale grocery business in 1926. He advanced to assistant treasurer with the 
company and stayed with Hulman when he bought the Speedway in 1945 from Eddie 
Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace and then president of American 
Airlines.

OREGON IGNORES NBA; BASKETBALL IN BETTING GAME

<P>
The Oregon Lottery Commission decided unanimously today to add professional 
basketball to its Sports Action betting game. 
</P>
<P>
The commission brushed aside a threat by NBA Commissioner David Stern, who said 
last week that the league will file suit if the state went ahead with its 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
Stern argued that including the NBA in the contest would compromise the 
integrity of the sport and make fans more concerned with point spreads than 
with the game of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
But Lottery Commissioner Michael Schwartz said such contentions were not well 
founded. 
</P>
<P>
"To our knowledge there are no facts to substantiate these concerns," Schwartz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the NBA has done nothing to stop large-scale sports gambling in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery Commissioner Delbert Hayes said the commission received a mandate from 
the Legislature to generate money for college athletic programs with new 
lottery games. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said it would be "splitting hairs" to differentiate the planned NBA 
betting game from the existing Sports Action betting on the outcome of National 
Football League games. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon is the only state operating a lottery-sponsored betting game based on 
the outcome of professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
The Portland Trail Blazers will not be included in the new game. Lottery 
Director Jim Davey said the Blazers were being left out as a courtesy. The NBA 
Sports Action game is expected to begin in early January, with wagering allowed 
on 16 games a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the lottery's public opinion surveys indicated that about two-thirds of 
those playing the football version of Sports Action will play the professional 
basketball contest. 
</P>
<P>
Davey has said the Oregon lottery is ready to defend its action in court. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that a court in Delaware has ruled that a sports betting contest like 
Sports Action is a game of chance and therefore falls under the lottery 
category. 
</P>
<P>
The Oregon game, the first of its kind in the country, allows people to wager 
at least $1 on three to 14 NFL games. To win, a person must pick all games 
correctly against point spreads set by a Las Vegas odds maker. 
</P>
<P>
Since the game began in early September, sales have totaled $5 million, with 
$1.9 million distributed to help fund intercollegiate sports at the state's 
colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
Davey has estimated that the NBA game will generate $3.5 million. He said the 
game will begin in January in conjunction with the NFL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 20, Stern came to Salem to argue his case at a commission meeting. He 
told the group that the game would make every questionable play come under 
suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA Players Assn. and several members of the Trail Blazers have also come 
out strongly against the Sports Action proposal.

TAXES: As tax bills go, the one Orange County homeowners owe at midnight takes 
a personal, almost folksy tone: "Make check payable to Robert L. 'Bob' Citron." 
. . . Citron has been sending out bills like this since he was first elected 18 
years ago. Not to promote himself, he said, but because he accepts tax payments 
for 175 different agencies. . . . Still, Irvine-based political consultant 
Eileen Padberg wondered if Citron's dunning notices help boost his reelection 
chances. . . . "It helps," she said, "because people know his name." Dana

CALTRANS WORKS TO REOPEN PART OF FREEWAY LINK

<P>
Caltrans maintenance crews worked feverishly Sunday to repair one of the 
county's busiest freeway interchanges that was closed after an accident during 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were expected to reopen the Number 2 lane of the two-lane overpass 
from the eastbound Riverside Freeway to the northbound Orange Freeway late 
Sunday night, a Caltrans spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol closed the interchange Saturday after a big rig 
hauling two 13-ton rolls of coiled steel overturned, dumping its load. The 
fallen rolls of steel gouged craters 4 feet wide by 2 feet deep in the 
pavement, exposing the supportive steel mesh. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesman Albert Miranda said the agency's engineers assessed the 
damage Saturday and decided that with minor repairs, the Number 2 lane could be 
reopened without posing any hazards to motorists. 
</P>
<P>
The Caltrans repairs, he said, were just a temporary measure, adding that the 
Number 1 lane, which suffered structural damage, will remain closed. Private 
contractors would have to assess the damage and bid for a contract to repair 
the interchange, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Miranda: "Opening the Number 2 lane should be enough to support the volume 
of traffic that goes through there in the morning. We know more motorists use 
the road in the evening, and that may pose some problems." 
</P>
<P>
Miranda and a CHP spokesman said authorities would probably decide today 
whether alternate routes would be needed to handle the heavy flow of evening 
traffic. "If we need detours, we will have a wide selection to choose from," 
Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 421,000 motorists use the interchange each day. Over the weekend, 
motorists were directed to the southbound Orange Freeway transition to Lincoln 
Avenue, from where they could re-enter the northbound side of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
A CHP spokesman said the closing of the ramp did not significantly affect 
traffic conditions near the interchange Sunday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an 8-year-old Jewish boy in Hamburg, Max Wolfsberg saw Hitler. He and his 
family survived anxious moments during the frightful Kristallnacht in 1938, and 
they fled Germany the following year, a week before the Nazis launched their 
invasion of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years later, Wolfsberg -- now a chemistry professor at UC Irvine -- was 
back in Germany, and once again witness to momentous events: the collapse of 
the Communist regime, the beginnings of democracy in East Germany and the 
dismantling of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"It was overwhelming," Wolfsberg said. "I'm completely convinced it's 
irreversible." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsberg had been invited to Leipzig for a month as part of an interacademy 
exchange administered by the National Academy of Sciences. He had been there 
before to attend conferences, had taught as a visiting professor at a West 
German university, and was well aware of the changes beginning to sweep through 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But neither he nor his wife was prepared for the blistering pace of the 
political maelstrom they soon found themselves in. 
</P>
<P>
They saw marches of half a million people in Leipzig, the cradle of the 
uprising. They attended a classical music concert that turned out to be fraught 
with political meaning. And, for the first time among their visits to the 
German Democratic Republic, the Wolfsbergs found strangers willing to talk to 
them -- sometimes directly, sometimes in thinly veiled references to the 
historic events. 
</P>
<P>
"We arrived in Leipzig around midnight Monday, Oct. 16," Max Wolfsberg said in 
an interview last week, back home in Corona del Mar. "On Wednesday, people told 
us there was an earthquake in San Francisco -- and that (East German leader 
Erich) Honecker resigned. There were two quakes that day." 
</P>
<P>
That evening, in the apartment given them for their month's stay, the 
Wolfsbergs watched Egon Krenz, then the newly appointed government head, 
deliver a 90-minute television address in which he promised to begin "a change 
of direction." 
</P>
<P>
The popular uprising that brought down Honecker had begun weeks earlier with 
weekly Monday marches in Leipzig, often right after a prayer service at the 
Nikolai Church in the old center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfsbergs agreed that they would go and watch the next demonstration on 
Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
They joined a quarter-million people who marched through Karl-Marx Platz, past 
the city's opera house and concert hall -- and who stopped and booed in front 
of the headquarters of the hated Stasi, or security police. 
</P>
<P>
"They would shout, 'Visum frei bis Shanghai!' -- asking for unrestricted travel 
as far as Shanghai -- "or 'Wir sind das Volk!' -- we are the people," Max 
Wolfsberg said. 
</P>
<P>
That slogan upset Wolfsberg because it was similar to one he heard as a boy in 
Nazi Germany: Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fuehrer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hitler's Motorcade 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried they would shout that also," the white-haired theoretical 
chemist said, his carefully assembled collection of East German newspapers laid 
out before him. "It brought back the Nazi era." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled the day in 1936 when he demanded that his mother take him to see 
Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
His class in the private school he attended was going downtown the next day to 
see Hitler's motorcade, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
"They suggested that I not go," he said. "I made my mother take me . . . I 
raised such a fuss." 
</P>
<P>
Because he was so small, his mother passed him forward to the front row of the 
crowd gathered to see Hitler. He ended up watching from the knee of a Nazi 
storm trooper. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he didn't know I was a Jew," Wolfsberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon enough, Wolfsberg said, he recognized "the terrible things" that were 
going on in his homeland. An uncle was put in a concentration camp. Nazis tried 
to arrest his father on Kristallnacht -- "Night of the Broken Glass," in which 
Nazi mobs throughout Germany and Austria burned and pillaged Jewish homes and 
businesses on Nov. 9, 1938 -- but were turned away. 
</P>
<P>
Max developed a case of jaundice soon after Kristallnacht. "It was 
stress-related," Wolfsberg said he was told. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfsberg family fled Germany in 1939, flying to Sweden, then boarding a 
ship bound for New York. They lived in Galveston, Tex., for three years, before 
moving to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
It was there, at Washington University, that Wolfsberg attended college and 
received his doctorate in chemistry. He came to UC Irvine in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsberg returned to Germany for the first time in 1959, while spending a year 
in Europe on a fellowship. He was still bitter about what his native country 
had done to him and his family. 
</P>
<P>
"You were impossible," Marilyn Wolfsberg recalled, shaking her head. 
</P>
<P>
Other Visits 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wolfsberg made other trips to Germany. In 1977, he was awarded a prize 
from the German Humboldt Foundation and was invited to work for a year at the 
Max Planck Institute in Mainz, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
He told the secretary general of the foundation that he was not sure he should 
even accept the award. 
</P>
<P>
"I poured out my feelings to him," Wolfsberg said. "After that . . . I began to 
feel comfortable . . . I don't have those feelings anymore." 
</P>
<P>
And how did Wolfsberg, a survivor of the Nazis, feel during his most recent 
journey to East Germany -- when the prospect of a united Germany once again 
dominating the map of Europe suddenly looming nearer than at any time since 
World War II? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure yet," he said. "I can't sort those feelings out." 
</P>
<P>
It was easy enough in Leipzig, however, for both Wolfsbergs to grasp the 
growing feelings of resentment and anger among East Germans toward a corrupt 
regime -- and the excitement of a people speaking out for the first time in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
One night, the couple attended an all-Tchaikovsky concert of the famed Leipzig 
Gewandhaus Orchestra. The conductor, Kurt Masur, had been one of the earliest 
figures in Leipzig to speak out against the government, and he had recently 
returned from a tour of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
When Masur came out to open the concert, the audience stood and applauded for 
10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"There were two party members in front of us, wearing party pins," Max 
Wolfsberg recalled. "They didn't applaud." 
</P>
<P>
While Max spent his days doing research or meeting with East German scientists, 
Marilyn explored the city, sometimes jogging through parks and down narrow 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hideous Place' 
</P>
<P>
One day, she said, she happened upon a group of children in their early teens 
and stopped to talk. 
</P>
<P>
One boy asked if she had been "downtown" yesterday -- an indirect way of asking 
if she had witnessed that week's protest march. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Yes,' I said. He said, 'So was I.' " 
</P>
<P>
Another student -- a girl -- asked Wolfsberg what she thought of East Germany. 
Taking care not to offend, she told the girl that she found the country 
interesting, even fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hideous place," was the girl's reply, Wolfsberg recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfsbergs attended two other demonstrations -- one on Oct. 30 of 700,000 
people, and one the following week, in a driving rain, when about 300,000 
showed up. They were stunned at the absence of violence. 
</P>
<P>
A drunk or a provocateur easily could have thrown rocks through the glass wall 
of the city's concert hall, they said. "It never happened," Max Wolfsberg said. 
</P>
<P>
From Leipzig, the Wolfsbergs drove to East Berlin on Nov. 10, just as the 
government was punching new holes in the wall and promising that freedom of 
travel would be permanent. When they arrived, they saw thousands of people 
lining up to obtain visas and cross for the first time into the West. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day -- a Saturday, and their last day before returning home -- the 
Wolfsbergs went to dinner at the Ephraim Palais, once the residence of a royal 
jeweler and now a museum and restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Wolfsberg had tried several times that day to call the restaurant and 
make reservations, but no one had answered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reflection 
</P>
<P>
"When we got there, I told them that we hadn't been able to reach them all 
day," she said. "The waiter answered, 'We were over there, on the other side.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Back home, just a few blocks from the spectacular cliffs of the Irvine coast, 
the professor's wife reflected on a month spent among people who put what 
little they had on the line -- and won. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such an exciting time," she said. "To see democracy being born in a 
very nonviolent way."

STREET SMART: AIRBORNE CHP USES PACING METHOD TO CATCH SPEEDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I was recently cited by the California Highway Patrol for exceeding the speed 
limit on the freeway. I was told that they timed me by radar from an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
I was under the impression that radar was not permitted to be used by the CHP. 
Could you tell me whether this is a correct impression? Thanks very much for 
your help. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Burgess 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Sounds like you either misunderstood or someone was pulling your leg. 
</P>
<P>
While the California Highway Patrol sends airplanes aloft to nab speeding 
motorists and in certain instances deploys ground units armed with radar, it 
never uses radar from an airplane, according to Sam Haynes, a CHP spokesman in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes said airborne patrol units use pacing techniques to figure out how fast 
motorists are going, lining up the aircraft with a car and checking the ground 
speed before alerting officers back on terra firma to issue a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
The flying CHP units are a fixture up and down the Santa Ana Freeway in the 
Central Valley, but the aircraft are not used to spot speeders in Orange or Los 
Angeles counties, Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
Radar is another matter. Although the agency is prohibited from using radar on 
a general basis throughout the state, counties or cities can buy the equipment 
and then request that the CHP use it to catch speeders. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, radar is being employed by the CHP in about 30 counties in 
California, mostly to enforce the speed limit on local city streets. In Orange 
County, officers pack radar guns only while patrolling the Ortega Highway and a 
dozen city streets in Tustin. Radar is not used on any freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I was wondering about traffic on the coming into Orange County and on 
California 71 coming from Chino and that area. Could the 71 be put through to 
California 133 and then keep going down toward Laguna Beach, where the new 
freeway is planned to connect to California 73 in Newport Beach? 
</P>
<P>
I also think that California 57 should be pulled through to Interstate 405. I 
would think that that would relieve traffic on the California 55 and also on 
the Interstate 5 and the 91. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
The answer to your driving desires may be in a single word: tollways. 
</P>
<P>
There are no plans to extend the Corona Expressway (71), which would entail 
pushing a road through rugged terrain in the Cleveland National Forest. But a 
special agency composed of representatives of various Orange County cities is 
planning a tollway that would start at the Riverside Freeway (91) near Gypsum 
Canyon Road and run 23 miles south to the Laguna Freeway (133), with a second 
leg branching off to the Santa Ana Freeway (Interstate 5) between Culver Drive 
and Jamboree Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The tollway will be called the Eastern Transportation Corridor and will cost 
about $840 million. Construction is to begin in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Freeway (57) is also being considered for a tollway that would 
continue the freeway along the Santa Ana River to the San Diego Freeway 
(Interstate 405). The state Legislature has created a special commission to 
seek proposals for tollways, and the Orange Freeway extension is among the most 
likely candidates. Authorities estimate that the project would cost about $1.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Where Irvine Avenue heads north and crosses the Corona del Mar Freeway, there 
is a single left-turn lane onto Bristol Street. Why isn't the middle lane a 
left-turn lane too? Even having it as a lane from which motorists could choose 
to go straight or turn left would help reduce the long line of cars waiting to 
make the turn. 
</P>
<P>
Having one lane for turning left onto Bristol and onto the freeways while there 
are two lanes for through traffic seems a very unbalanced way to handle the 
traffic volume. This configuration also invites some drivers to cut into the 
left lane dangerously at the last possible moment. 
</P>
<P>
The improvement could be easily done with a painted arrow on the street, and it 
would not require having to wait for the current bridge-widening to be 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret C. Palmer 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
As you note, the bridge in that spot is being rebuilt. Once it is finished, 
there will be room for an additional left-turn lane onto Bristol Street, which 
leads to the Corona del Mar Freeway on-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
For the meantime, though, the idea to use the middle lane for optional left 
turns is a worthy one. Unfortunately, county transportation planners say that 
would probably not work well at this intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Hogan, the transportation division manager for the Orange County 
Environmental Management Agency, said the problem with providing left-turn 
options from middle lanes is that it requires signalization that permits 
traffic to move in only one direction at a time on a street. As a result, cars 
would probably end up sitting a bit longer than they do now.

<P>
THE ENVIRONMENT: A GROUP OF STUDENTS CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIDE POOLS USE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO PASS OUT LEAFLETS ABOUT SEA LIFE AND TELL VISITORS TO BE 
CAREFUL.

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of beach-goers attracted by exceptionally low tides were swarming 
across the reefs below Heisler Park Sunday, poking around tide pools -- and 
inadvertently crunching the scores of marine creatures underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
It was a sight to chill an environmentalist, but there was a small group of 
student activists there to sound the alarm and keep the casualties to a 
minimum. The students spent several hours moving through the crowd to tell 
sightseers about the fragility of the reef's ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the beach. I don't want to see it get ruined," said Julie Kovacs, a 
junior at Dana Hills High School, as she passed out literature to beach 
visitors and warned them not to destroy or remove anything from the area. The 
reefs are a marine life refuge protected by state law. 
</P>
<P>
Julie, a member of Students Against a Vanishing Environment (SAVE), was one of 
about two dozen high school and college students who stationed themselves at 
various sections of the Orange County coastline Sunday as the area was 
experiencing the the twice-yearly phenomenon known as "minus tides." During 
this time of exceptionally low tides, the tide pools and their abundant marine 
life can be seen. 
</P>
<P>
The tide began dropping around noon Sunday, and within a few hours beach-goers 
were treading across more than 50 yards of reef that normally would have been 
submerged under several feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
Minus tides result when the sun and moon are in a certain position relative to 
the Earth. The combined gravitational effect of the sun and moon causes extreme 
tides around the times of the winter and summer equinoxes. In the summer, 
however, the minus tides occur at night, posing less risk to the tide pools. 
The winter minus tides will continue for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The students and their instructors picked Sunday as a particularly "high impact 
day" to take their message to the public: it would be one of the first days of 
the very low tides, and its being on the weekend meant that many people were 
likely to be there. 
</P>
<P>
Natasha Chandanani, co-president of SAVE and also a Dana Hills High junior, 
said the group's beach blitz would help protect the coastline during a 
particularly sensitive time and also give the students an opportunity to take 
their appeals on behalf of the environment directly to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"They're ignorant -- not all of them, but many of them," Natasha said of the 
beach-goers. "They need to be educated, and you have to get out and do your 
part." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protected Area 
</P>
<P>
At the core of the students' effort, they said, is a simple message: Feel free 
to look but not to touch or take. 
</P>
<P>
The lifeguards at Laguna reinforced that injunction with announcements over a 
public address system notifying beach-goers that they were visiting a protected 
area and that taking anything from it is against the law. Violators can face a 
$1,000 fine and six months' imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Waian, head of the Saddleback College environmental studies department and 
an organizer for the outing, was there Sunday, surveying the scores of people 
-- and a few dogs -- combing the reef near Laguna's Main Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the sheer numbers of people out here shows how important this is," Waian 
said of the students' efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Waian nor the students were asking beach-goers to stay out of the area. 
Indeed, they applaud public interest in marine life. But, Waian said, tide 
pools are exceptionally fragile, and visitors must approach them carefully to 
avoid doing serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, some beach-goers will stumble upon beautiful shells 
nestled in the cracks of the reef. Some, after checking to see that nothing is 
living inside, he said, will then pocket the shell and "put it up on the 
mantle." Although that by itself may not do any immediate harm, he said, it 
does have a long-term impact. "If you do that, you've reduced the number of 
housing sites for hermit crabs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can love a resource to death as well as kill it with malice or ignorance. 
What we're trying to develop is a more sophisticated way of loving our 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Most beach-goers appeared concerned about heeding the warnings. But, Waian 
said, a videotape technician working with the students recorded several divers 
leaving the area with bags of shellfish and other marine life. The divers 
concealed their catch and fled, he said, but the tape is being reviewed and 
will be shown to state Department of Fish and Game officials should the 
subjects be identifiable. 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors, however, were being as careful as possible as they picked their 
way through the tide pool rocks. Sightseers approached Waian and the students 
for copies of their leaflets, and one young girl interpreted the message for a 
group of Spanish-speaking visitors, who nodded appreciatively. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are being pretty sensitive to it," said Paul Russell of Laguna 
Beach. "Most people try to be caring about the tide pools." 
</P>
<P>
Roy Miller of Huntington Beach, who was visiting the beach with his daughter 
and grandson, agreed but said he worries that the increasing public interest in 
tide pools could hurt them in the long run. Miller pointed to the damp rocks 
teeming with mussels, crabs, sea anemones and sea urchins. "There's no way you 
can walk without stepping on some of that life," he said. "I just don't know 
what the happy balance is between caring and doing damage."

Major decisions on two of Garden Grove's biggest redevelopment projects, a 
downtown office-retail complex and a three-story hotel, are expected at 
tonight's City Council meeting. The office-retail project would be at the 
northwest corner of Garden Grove Boulevard and Euclid Street, an 8.5-acre site 
which has been vacant for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
IDM of Long Beach would build a five-story office building and several 
one-story retail and office structures. Construction would begin in January, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
The council also is scheduled to vote on La Quinta Inns' plan to build a 
three-story, 168-room hotel on a 2.8-acre site at the northwest corner of 
Garden Grove Boulevard and Haster Street.

MEDIATOR MAY MEET TEACHERS, OFFICIALS

<P>
A state mediator is tentatively scheduled to meet with Tustin school district 
officials and members of the teachers union this week in an effort to reach a 
contract agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The previous contract for teachers, nurses, psychologists, speech therapists 
and counselors in the Tustin Unified School District expired June 30. 
Negotiations for the 1989-90 contract have been going on since April, and an 
impasse was declared Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
The mediator, Dave Hart, has met with district officials and members of the 
Tustin Educators Assn. twice. He is tentatively scheduled to meet with the two 
sides again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The primary stumbling block in negotiations has been salary. The district has 
offered a salary increase of between 6% and 7% to the 425 employees represented 
by the union. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Maurice A. Ross said the district has received state funding to provide a 
4.6% cost-of-living increase and cannot afford to pay as much as the teachers 
want. 
</P>
<P>
The union wants a pay increase of between 10% and 10.5%, said Joyce Rohrbaugh, 
president of the union. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrbaugh said the district's most experienced teachers are paid less than 
those with similar experience in other districts. 
</P>
<P>
Ross said he is optimistic that a settlement will be reached soon, but 
Rohrbaugh said she has been disappointed by the negotiations so far. SHANNON

MAN SUFFERS FATAL CUT IN BAR FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 22-year-old man was fatally injured Sunday morning when his throat was 
slashed during a fight that started inside the Red Turtle Bar and spilled out 
into a parking lot, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts to save him, Pedro Ramon Miranda of Santa Ana died of his 
injuries at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, Santa Ana 
Police Sgt. Jim McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the fight started about 1:30 a.m. inside the Red Turtle Bar at 1019 
S. Fairview St. During the melee, someone cut Miranda across the throat with a 
knife and fled, McDaniel said. When paramedics arrived, Miranda was near death 
from loss of blood. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that they saw a man carrying a knife running from the 
parking lot. They described him as between the ages of 20 and 24, 5 feet, 6 
inches tall and having a slender build, and that he was wearing a white 
T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"This happened in a real difficult neighborhood," McDaniel said.

2,500 FLOCK TO TOURING BIRD BAZAAR

Sunny, an 8-year-old parrot, wouldn't land a spot on the "Stupid Pet Tricks" 
segment of the David Letterman show, but he drew a crowd Sunday at Bird Expo, a 
bird swap meet held at the Orange County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny didn't say a lot -- just "Hello" and "I love you" -- but it was enough to 
charm spectators. 
</P>
<P>
At least 2,500 bird enthusiasts shopped amid the squawks, shrieks and whistles 
of thousands of birds, including an exotic trio of white mute swans, an $8,000 
hyacinth macaw and common $6 parakeets. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny's owner, Robbie Harris of La Habra, said she has had unusual success 
breeding exotic birds and raising them to be gentle pets. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had Sunny since he was a day old," she said. "He's like part of the 
family. He falls asleep on his back in my lap in front of the television." 
</P>
<P>
But he also lets out a squawk to let Harris know when someone is coming up the 
walk or when one of her newborn Sheltie puppies has escaped from its box. 
</P>
<P>
Bird Expo is held six times a year, alternating its location from the Orange 
County Fairgrounds to the Cow Palace in San Francisco. Tiny waxwings and 
finches are exhibited for sale next to exotic and colorful cockatoos selling 
for $15,000 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the exotic birds are worth a lot of money now because the countries 
who used to export them have passed legislation to protect them from 
extinction, said Lance Bryson of Laguna Niguel, a bird enthusiast. "This is 
good in some ways. But not enough is being done to preserve their habitats, so 
more effort is being made in this country to to breed them in captivity." 
</P>
<P>
Bryson said birds are challenging the popularity of cats and dogs as pets 
because birds require less space and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
"Newer residential developments like the kind here in Orange County don't have 
as much yard space as older homes, and people just don't have enough room for a 
dog. Neighbors get upset when you take Fifi out for a walk and let her go the 
bathroom on their lawn. In some apartments and condos birds are the only kind 
of pet allowed," Bryson said. JANICE L. JONES

4 HELD IN KIDNAP THAT ENDED IN SHOOTING; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: SUSPECT WOUNDED BY OFFICER AFTER BEING DRIVEN TO POLICE PARKING LOT BY 
ONE OF THE ALLEGED VICTIMS.

Three people were arrested Sunday in connection with a foiled kidnap attempt 
that had ended earlier when police shot and wounded a fourth suspect at the 
Orange police station, where he had been driven without his knowledge by the 
alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Duque, 26, and Jose Hernandez Garcia, 42, both of Santa Ana, and a 
juvenile whose name was not released were arrested on kidnaping charges early 
Sunday morning in Santa Ana, a day after three people, including a day-old baby 
boy, were reportedly abducted near Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Police Sgt. Art Romo said investigators found the suspects and their 
small gray car on a residential street in Santa Ana, where they were arrested 
without incident and taken to Orange County Jail and Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
All three are being held in connection with an alleged kidnaping that began 
about 3 p.m. Saturday near the Riverside Freeway in Riverside. Police said the 
victims, Nelson Preves, 45, of Santa Ana, Esines Lisett Rodriquez, 23, of 
Orange, and her child, were abducted in the drug-related incident after 
visiting Rodriquez's grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strange what happened," Romo said, "especially when you have a day-old 
infant involved." 
</P>
<P>
Four men in a gray car confronted Preves, Rodriquez and the baby as they drove 
away from the grandmother's home in a late-model Mazda pickup truck. According 
to police reports, one suspect, Emilio Sitt Garcia, 19, armed with a 
.45-caliber pistol, ordered Preves to drive to Santa Ana and jumped in the back 
of the Mazda alone. 
</P>
<P>
But Preves knew the location of the Orange police station and, unbeknown to 
Garcia, headed there instead. The other suspects followed in the gray car at 
least part of the way before going on to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the truck arrived about 4:45 p.m. in the back lot of the department 
at 300 Almond St. Rodriquez, holding the baby, jumped out and ran toward a 
motorcycle officer, who was standing about 10 feet away. Romo said the young 
woman stopped in front of the truck and tried to explain why they needed help. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Garcia jumped from the bed of the truck into the passenger side of 
the cab, where he wrestled with Preves over the .45-caliber pistol. During the 
scuffle, Romo said, the gun went off, wounding Preves in the chest and hand. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing the gunshots, Rodriquez fell to the ground with the baby, Romo said, 
and the officer ordered Garcia to drop the gun. When he failed to obey the 
command, Romo said, the officer fired two shots, hitting Garcia in the hip and 
abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Gunfire shattered the Mazda's windshield and windows on the passenger's and 
driver's sides. 
</P>
<P>
"You really don't know what is going on in some of these things," Romo said. 
"But if someone is shooting, you have to take immediate action to stop the 
threat." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who was held on suspicion of attempted murder and kidnaping, was 
treated at UCI Medical Center in Orange and transfered to the jail ward at 
United Western Medical Center-Anaheim. Preves was admitted to the intensive 
care unit at United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. Both were listed in 
stable condition Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating the shooting and 
police are looking into the entire incident, but some details remain sketchy.

BLACK LEADERS PLAN FIRST-EVER KWANZAA IN COUNTY TO CELEBRATE UNITY, HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As residents frantically shop, bake and decorate for Christmas Day, leaders of 
Orange County's black community are also busy preparing for the day after -- 
the beginning of the county's first celebration of Kwanzaa, a traditional 
weeklong festival of African-American culture and unity. 
</P>
<P>
Spreading the word about Kwanzaa will be a difficult task, said Roland Holmes, 
program director of the Orange County Urban League. Most black residents are 
scattered throughout the county and unaware of plans for the celebration, which 
will be at the Corbin Center in Santa Ana. But whatever the turnout, the first 
Kwanzaa is bound to enhance the cultural pride of the black community, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My main concern is establishing the meaning of Kwanzaa and the seven 
principles," Holmes said. "I think once folks get a chance to learn what 
Kwanzaa means for our everyday lives, they will (become) more involved." 
</P>
<P>
The seven-day ceremony, which begins the day after Christmas and ends New 
Year's Day, means "first fruits" in Swahili, based on an African agricultural 
calendar, and observes nguzo saba (seven principles). Each day focuses on one 
of the principles. 
</P>
<P>
'Cultural Celebration' 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a substitute for Christmas," Holmes said. "Christmas is a religious 
celebration. Kwanzaa is a cultural celebration." 
</P>
<P>
Kwanzaa was brought to the United States in the mid-1960s by Maulana Karenga, 
the current chairperson of the black studies department at Cal State Long 
Beach. Karenga translated ancient African writings from Swahili, and from them 
created a contemporary celebration of African-American heritage. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate, families or community groups gather each evening of Kwanzaa, 
light one candle each night on the kinara, which is a candelabrum, similar to a 
Jewish menorah, and discuss the principle for that day. Afterward, they recite 
a series of chants in Swahili and celebrants drink from the karamu, a unity 
cup, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a basic ceremony, but over the years it has expanded and changed," 
said Itihari Toure, an activist and community worker in Los Angeles. With 
"different families, different things may be added or deleted, depending on who 
celebrates it." 
</P>
<P>
The seven Kwanzaa principles are: umoja (unity), kujichagulia 
(self-determination), ujima (collective work and responsibility), ujamaa 
(cooperative economics), nia (purpose), kuumba (creativity) and imani (faith). 
They encourage one to enhance his community by improving his own life. For 
example, the sixth principle, kuumba, stresses the importance of being creative 
in order to leave the community "more beautiful, more beneficial than we 
inherited it," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
And ujima (faith), the third principle, encourages the community to "make our 
sisters' and brothers' problems our problem . . . to work to share them 
together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"All the principles of Kwanzaa can be found in the dream espoused by Martin 
Luther King (Jr.)," said Holmes, referring to the slain civil rights leader's 
famous speech. "It's nothing new.' 
</P>
<P>
Makungu Akinyela, a Los Angeles-based preacher and political organizer, said 
the 24-year-old tradition is practiced in communities nationwide, but is best 
known in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, a Kwanzaa parade, modeled after a traditional African 
procession, is held every year on the Saturday of Kwanzaa, Akinyela said. 
Celebrants leading the parade carry seven colorful six-foot foam cubes, each 
one symbolizing one of the principles. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, participants in this year's Los Angeles parade will don African garb 
of bright red, black and green -- the colors of African liberation -- and walk 
the route to the beat of African music, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Black residents in Orange County do not celebrate Kwanzaa because the community 
is small and most have not yet learned about it, said the Rev. James Carrington 
of the Friendship Baptist Church in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing Kwanzaa to Orange County could help black residents better understand 
their heritage, Holmes said. Black history has been lost over the years, and 
younger blacks have little sense of the role their forefathers played in 
shaping American society, he said.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES POLITICAL REFORM; 
</P>
<P>
CIVICS CLASS NOW IN SESSION IN E. GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARILYN J. HARRAN, Marilyn J. Harran is associate professor of religion and 
history and director of the Freshman Seminar Program at Chapman College in 
Orange. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the first Monday in October, I crossed over the border into the German 
Democratic Republic. Under an international fellowship, I had come to the GDR 
to study the Reformation of the 16th Century. But during the two months I was 
there, in Leipzig and Dresden, I witnessed 20-Century history in the making, a 
people's revolution that dramatically changed the shape of East German society. 
In short, the country I entered in October was not the same one I exited in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Every Monday while I was there, the politicians debated and the people of 
Leipzig prayed in the churches and then moved to the public square to 
demonstrate for social change. 
</P>
<P>
In Chapman College's Freshman Seminar Program on "War and Peace," my colleagues 
and I hope to persuade our students that, as knowledgeable and involved 
citizens, they can make a difference, and that the freedoms we have can never 
be taken for granted. As I saw the students and workers of Leipzig take to the 
streets to achieve those rights we regard as basic -- free elections, 
unrestricted travel, freedom of the press -- I often wished our students could 
have been there to witness this extraordinary testimony to the power of the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
I will never forget my own fear at crossing police lines to my apartment, 
overlooking the Nikolai Church, scene of the demonstrations. Nor will I forget 
the demonstration and police response on the 40th anniversary of the republic. 
The incongruity between the orchestrated parades in East Berlin and the 
spontaneous public demonstration against the government in Leipzig and other 
cities was striking. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, I will never forget the courage shown by those who massed on the 
streets that day, weeks before the Berlin Wall was to come down, at a time when 
no one knew how much force the government would exert against the 
demonstrators. Many demonstrators feared that they would be re-enacting 
another, and even bloodier, Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation still abounds regarding exactly what happened and who was 
responsible for the order not to shoot. But on that day and in the following 
months the resolve of the demonstrators never wavered. As many of their fellow 
citizens continued to pour from Hungary and Czechoslovakia into West Germany, 
the demonstrators, in ever growing numbers, shouted "We are staying here!" "We 
are the people!" 
</P>
<P>
The partial changes enacted by the new post-Honecker government, even the 
dramatic change in travel laws and the partial dismantling of the Wall, did not 
satisfy the demonstrators who knew that bankrupt East German society needed a 
full and complete cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
In large part, that cleansing has occurred. Egon Krenz and his cronies have 
been evicted from power, and an entire country is working to build a democratic 
society. In many ways, the country has experienced a massive purging. 
Television journalists commented that they had not served the people and asked 
for forgiveness and patience while they learned to be true reporters. 
Newspapers that had expressed only the Communist party's positions began under 
new editors to record diverse opinions about what should be done next. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more importantly, they revealed the corruption and luxurious life 
styles of leaders who had constantly reminded the people of the sacrifices 
necessary to build a socialist state. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly a land where people had been terrified that an overheard comment could 
land them in prison, became a national public forum. On street corners, in 
trains, people talked of nothing else -- sometimes with skepticism, sometimes 
with hope, always with passion and a sense of awe at being able to present 
ideas openly. 
</P>
<P>
One disembodied voice I heard from loudspeakers near the old Town Hall of 
Leipzig urged the people not to demonstrate and pleaded that "our problems 
cannot be solved on the street." But the long-term changes in the economy, 
education and the environment can only happen because of the courage shown 
during the people's revolution that occurred in the streets of Leipzig. 
</P>
<P>
When students question whether they can make a difference in society, I hope 
the example of the GDR will convince them of how much power they truly possess 
-- whether they take to the streets or use their right to voice their beliefs 
in the voting booth. When free elections come to the GDR, I know of no East 
German who will need to be urged to vote. I hope the proposal voiced by several 
Leipzig professors comes true -- that the headquarters of the hated "Stasi," 
the secret police, becomes the new university library.

TWO NADADORES QUALIFY FOR SWIM NATIONALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two 16-year-old Mission Viejo Nadadores swimmers, Eric Diehl and Ryan Cox, 
qualified for the U.S. Senior Nationals in the 1,650-yard freestyle event 
Sunday at Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Diehl won the race in 15 minutes 37.87 seconds and Cox followed in 15:40.92. 
The qualifying standard for the Senior Nationals, to be held in Nashville in 
March, is 15:45.39. Earlier in the invitational, which started Thursday, Diehl 
had qualified for the Senior Nationals in the 1,000-, 500- and 200-yard 
freestyle events. 
</P>
<P>
Diehl and Cox were the only swimmers to qualify for the senior event, which 
will serve as the trials for the Goodwill Games in Seattle in 1990. Earlier in 
the competition Amy Ward of the Southern California Aquatics Club in Tustin 
qualified in the 1,000-, 500- and 200-yard free events.

There is no merrier sound to a retailer's ear than that of a constantly ringing 
cash register. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the vast bulk of the year's sales occurring in November and December, 
brisk sales during the holiday season are crucial for the nation's merchants. 
And Jim Charter, general manager of the Brea Mall, is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter, 62, joined the 12-year-old Brea Mall, at the intersection of Imperial 
Highway and State College Boulevard, in May, 1986 -- the day after he retired 
as May Centers' regional manager for the Los Angeles area. Easy-going and 
affable, the longtime retail veteran is a native of Orange who lives these days 
in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with Times Staff Writer Mary Ann Galante, Charter 
discussed the outlook for retailers this holiday season, and what's hot -- and 
what's not -- this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter also offered his view on major issues in the retail industry, talking 
about the importance of customer service, leveraged buyouts and the effect of 
mergers in the retail industry, and the ongoing, $120-million renovation of 
Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. For the retail industry in general, what do you see for the Christmas 
season? 
</P>
<P>
A. At this point, I think it will be fine. We were facing an election last 
year, and people were uncertain and unsure. Inflation isn't too bad. There 
seems to be good news from around the world. I'm thinking about the situation 
with the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do international events impact retail sales at Christmas? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think they affect people. We've become an electronic age more and more. I 
think people realize that what they see on TV is real. If you feel good, 
particularly at Christmastime, you think of people to buy presents for. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would it be fair to say that at least 25% to 30% of the retail industry's 
sales are during the holiday season in November and December? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. It's the important season for retailing in America. If America doesn't 
have a good Christmas season, the economy gets in trouble. That's why, when you 
ask why we put up decorations so early, you just don't realize how important it 
is to the retailer to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
You have to be ready. When you turn on your lights and you have Santa there, by 
God, they'd better be working and everything has to be ready. People have to 
realize that the retailer is going to do what's accepted. As long as people 
accept (early seasonal merchandising) and are happy about it, that's fine, and 
we have room for Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why does the Christmas sales season seem to start earlier and earlier every 
year? Why are we seeing signs of the holidays before Thanksgiving? 
</P>
<P>
A. Has there been any advertising in the Los Angeles Times for Christmas? Tell 
the staff at The Times that when they put a deadline in Christmas advertising, 
we'll put a deadline in Christmas decorations. It's amusing that the people who 
ask me the questions are the ones that sell the Christmas advertising in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
You can't expect to come into a season like Christmas without preparing. We're 
not Tinkerbell, where we can wave our magic wand and it appears. We're not Walt 
Disney, and it's not a cartoon. It's the real world. And we have to prepare for 
this. So we start in June. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But why are the retailers putting out Christmas displays, in some cases, 
even before Halloween? 
</P>
<P>
A. Before Halloween is a little early. But after that, you need to get ready. 
When are they going to sell? You're in the Christmas season (by) the first of 
November. You need to change your displays. It's not the night before 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are there any "must" items that consumers are snapping up this season? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think you're going to find that people will buy nice items, (such as) 
wearing apparel or gifts for the home. I don't know of any gimmicks that are 
here. I suppose CD players are going to be hot. Electronic items or personal 
PCs or programs are coming up. Nintendo, of course, for the children. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are we going to see a lot of last-minute discounting this holiday season 
again? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think there's a certain amount of discounting right now. But I think you 
have to be careful what's discounted and what isn't. I believe there will be a 
certain amount of discounting. Retailers do it every year. I'm not sure that 
it's going to dominate the season. 
</P>
<P>
They always wait till the very end. It's sort of a little contest between the 
public and the retailers. If the merchant has bought right and has the products 
that people want, he doesn't need a discount because he's already sold it. I 
don't think there's going to be a lot of panic buying. I think you need to go 
out and be sensible in your shopping. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Will Orange County do as well as the rest of the country in sales this 
holiday season? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think Orange County is a Shangri-La. I think we'll do as well or better. I 
think there's a little shakedown in certain areas -- certainly the savings and 
loan industry. But I think Orange County is strong. I think Los Angeles County 
is too. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem, with the unemployment rate so low, is that nobody can afford 
to live in the areas where you need employment. It's amazing what you have to 
make today to exist in this county. So everybody lives outside the county and 
workers need to be brought in. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is you've got hungry, homeless people living in an idyllic climate, 
and you're going to have to find space for them. Those are also the people that 
are needed to work in the restaurants, the homes and in shopping centers. They 
need to have the ability to make a living. The issue is something that Orange 
County's going to have to face. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Will Brea Mall be affected this Christmas by the fact that you still have 
ongoing construction? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. I don't believe so. We've had some good traffic. We're up around 5% for 
the year to date through October. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Concerning the retail industry in general, do you see a thinning of 
department store and major store dominance in favor of specialty retailers? Or 
perhaps in favor of the highly focused stores geared toward specific groups? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't really think it has to do with specialty stores. If you have a 
department store and you do it right, you can get your merchandise group. The 
problem is management and how they're approaching it. It's important to know 
who your merchandise group is. It's having a retailer that knows the business 
and who can communicate with his people on the floor. A specialty chain can do 
well if it can give service and if it is able to turn around on a dime. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You're talking about quick turn-around in merchandise? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Being able to bring up resources and find out what the public wants. 
Finding out what your market is and knowing your market. Knowing the age group, 
the income group and realizing that they're in your area. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In general, are the specialty chains doing a good job? 
</P>
<P>
A. The majority of ours at Brea Mall do, I think. Contempo continues to do 
well. The Limited, Silverwoods and Units are finding a market in our center. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you see a greater acceptance of off-price stores, of the discounters? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. I see an acceptance of stores that give value to the people. At one 
time, I heard a seminar speaker say that if people come into your store and you 
do something that's unacceptable to them, between nine to 20 people are going 
to hear about it. But if you go in and you have good service, you may not tell 
anybody. 
</P>
<P>
It's a concept that people have of you and your store. Number one, they want to 
feel like they have a bargain. Number two, everybody has an ego. When you give 
service to somebody, you're tapping your ego. You're pampering it. That's 
important. 
</P>
<P>
Q. There has been a wave of leveraged buyouts in the retail industry. Are we 
going to see higher-leveraged companies? Are we going to see more big stores on 
the auction block? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think what you're seeing now is that the big get better and the weak get 
weaker. I think that (Robert) Campeau (who bought Federated Department Stores 
in 1988 for $6.6 billion 
</P>
<P>
did a disservice to the retail business and all of North America. He came in 
and he overextended himself. There was no thought of tomorrow, just today. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does that have an effect on the retail industry? 
</P>
<P>
A. To a certain amount, yes. I think people wonder what's going on. Right now 
there are stories in the papers about discounts for Christmas because (of) 
Campeau and the ability of Campeau to pay (for merchandise). I think it makes a 
shopper wary of what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What do you see for Bullock's since its acquisition by Macy's last year? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think it's inevitable that Bullock's (takes the) Macy's (name). And I 
don't know whether the merchandising will stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Would mergers in the retail industry cause downward pressure on rents in the 
malls, assuming, for example, that there would be less competition for the 
space? 
</P>
<P>
A. That depends. The majority of major department stores own their own space. 
The only thing that affects our rent is if you have a retailer in a mall with 
weak department stores, or department stores that are about ready to leave the 
mall. Then you have to rent with going rates. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Going back to the effect on consumers, don't mergers in the industry also 
benefit consumers, in the sense that there would be discounting of merchandise? 
</P>
<P>
A. To an extent. It also affects supply. The bottom line is fashion. If you get 
the fashion that people want, that's what's going to sell. You don't go to buy 
a dress and say, 'Gee, this company's going broke. I don't want this one, I'll 
buy this one instead.' When you go into a store, you want the latest fashion. 
And if department store X has it on sale for $99 and the store down the street 
has it for $69, you're going to buy it for $69. 
</P>
<P>
People are success-driven. When you go into a store that's not successful, you 
get a lot of droopy sales people who are inattentive. And you really get turned 
off. When you go to a successful store and see somebody who's happy to see you, 
who presents you with merchandise that you know is right, you buy it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In Orange County, do you see an increase in service among malls here? Are 
they trying to outdo each other in services? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't perceive it as outdoing anybody. I perceive it as trying to 
accommodate our customers. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The regional malls locally have basically the same selection of anchors and 
very similar selections of retailers, with a very few exceptions. What can you 
do to maintain individuality? How do you attract people when there is such 
similarity in the retailers? 
</P>
<P>
A. We know our market. We use marketing programs and advertising so that 
customers don't travel by us to go to South Coast Plaza or MainPlace/Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Q. From how far away does Brea Mall draw customers? 
</P>
<P>
A. They travel from as far as Pomona, Chino Hills, Diamond Bar, then into 
Corona, Yorba Linda, Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, Whittier Heights, La Habra Heights 
and some parts of Orange. I think once we get (more) stores going (next year), 
we'll get some people back from the Santa Ana area, because some of those 
customers were frequenting us before. But we're going to concentrate mostly in 
this area and to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think we're over-malled already in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think for the population, we're over-retailed. There's so much retail it's 
unbelievable. And I think there's going to be a time when you see the strong 
get stronger and the weak get weaker. At some point and time, there has to be a 
stop. But as long as there's growth, we continue to expand. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Brea Mall has been undergoing a renovation for two years now. How has the 
mall changed since you arrived? 
</P>
<P>
A. The new Nordstrom store opened in February. We started in August of 1987 and 
we've remodeled the entire mall. We have new retailers. We have new activities, 
we have a completely new food court. 
</P>
<P>
We've consistently been in a growth pattern, and we probably will be for the 
next two to three years. We'll be opening new stores through all of 1990. 
Robinson's will start construction early next year and it will take them about 
14 months. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Some of your competitors have also undergone renovations recently. Fashion 
Island at Newport Center, for one, just finished a massive remodeling. Why do 
you think that Fashion Island in the past hasn't done as well as it might have? 
</P>
<P>
A. They put it in the wrong place. It's very difficult to get people in there. 
They should have put it next to the freeway. Freeways have meant a lot to the 
development shopping center. Brea Mall is indebted forever to the 57 Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra Fashion Square, on the other hand, is going down in flames because the 
(proposed) 39 Freeway was shot down. If that freeway had gone through you would 
have had a very competitive shopping center. Freeways have made a big 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think Orange County consumers will ever see a major regional mall at 
the Golden Triangle (the area in South County where the San Diego and Santa Ana 
freeways merge)? 
</P>
<P>
A. There might once have been the time to build a regional mall there. But I 
think it is past its time. I think they could do some different types of 
retailing there and some offices. But to have a regional center, to me, is like 
putting in a Crystal Court where they put it. (Crystal Court is a retail annex 
of South Coast Plaza.) 
</P>
<P>
 There is the Laguna Hills Mall and the Mission Viejo Mall and they're still 
viable. If there would be some expansion in those malls, then we wouldn't need 
a regional mall at the Golden Triangle. If you could attract a Nordstrom at 
Mission Viejo or Laguna Hills, that would kill the potential of (a regional 
mall at) the Golden Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
Q. On a personal level, what do you like about retailing? 
</P>
<P>
A. I'm dealing with both the tenants and the public and it's a challenge. It's 
fun seeing things happen like this building, getting the mall built up, getting 
things accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's the worst part of your job? 
</P>
<P>
A. I guess keeping the payables paid and the receivables received. You work 
long hours. You work hard. It isn't something you take off when you go home. 
</P>
<P>
But retailing is in the center of everything. It's what makes the world go 
round. They say love does, but I think it's retailing. Selling makes things 
happen. People make money, and that's what keeps the world going. I don't think 
there's anything wrong with making a profit. If you don't have profit, you 
don't open up the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers have to change and they have to be there to service the customer. And 
servicing the customer is more than a smile on their faces and saying, 'Have a 
good day.' It's being able to give them the product they want, and knowing what 
they need or what they want. 
</P>
<P>
If you can do that, then you can survive. What they want today is not what 
they're going to want tomorrow and you'd better be aware of that.

EX-TEMPTATIONS CAN STILL MOVE THE EMOTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In one of their best songs, the Temptations gave the world an indelible melody 
and a good piece of advice: walk and don't look back. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Kendricks, David Ruffin and Dennis Edwards, the three most prominent lead 
singers to emerge from the classic Motown vocal group, looked back anyway in a 
tuneful reunion Friday night at the Coach House, but two of the voices were 
walking with a limp. 
</P>
<P>
The most diminished of the former Temptations was Kendricks, who turns 50 this 
week. His creamy tenor falsetto soared effortlessly during the '60s and early 
'70s on such songs as "Just My Imagination" and "Get Ready," but it was 
earthbound and labored during the early show at the Coach House. With Kendricks 
struggling for pitch and control, the best thing a listener could do was to put 
the ear on pause and let the mind replay fonder memories of the way he used to 
do the things he'd do. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, 46, had no such problem. Taking the first of three solo turns in the 
spotlight after an opening trio number, he quickly showed that his forceful, 
raspy voice is as hale as ever with some ardent balladry and fiery funk. 
</P>
<P>
But Edwards was the junior partner in this gathering, not only in age but in 
historical rank on the Temptations' totem pole. While Edwards played an 
important part in a long list of hits after joining the group in 1968 as 
Ruffin's replacement, Ruffin and Kendricks will always be remembered as one of 
soul music's best vocal combinations, the voices who fronted the Temptations at 
their peak. When the three singers teamed together for a concluding, 30-minute 
run of Temptations classics (the solo spots had focused mainly on songs from 
their solo careers), Edwards played a secondary role on everything except "Papa 
Was a Rollin' Stone." 
</P>
<P>
It was Ruffin, the tall, thin singer with the trademark oversize eyeglasses, 
who gave the 85-minute show an element of fascination. Ruffin's voice is 
substantially diminished from the wonderfully rich and flexible baritone that 
it once was. But, like an aging athlete who gets by on smarts after his natural 
skills have eroded, Ruffin was able to rely on sheer professionalism and that 
intangible quality called soul to make the most of what remains. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffin made concessions to time and abuse (he walked on stage taking big drags 
from a cigarette) as he missed some notes and clipped off others that he would 
have stretched in his prime. But he never stopped aiming for the grace notes 
that make for fine soul singing -- the falsetto sustains, the husky shouts 
delivered for emotional effect -- and he pulled off enough of them to make the 
packed house know that it had heard a classy soul singer at work. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffin piled up most of his points during quieter passages, when he didn't have 
to push quite so hard to compete with a well-drilled, 11-member ensemble that 
featured two backup singers and a nicely modulated five-piece horn section. In 
moments such as the sadly emotional passage at the end of "I Wish It Would 
Rain," Ruffin still has the power to transcend matters of technique and sing 
pure feelings. 
</P>
<P>
The most talkative ex-Tempt, Ruffin also projected sincerity and warmth between 
songs. "Sometimes life plays little games, little tricks with you," said the 
singer, who of late has been in the news more for a 1988 cocaine possession 
conviction than for his music. "Through my career there's always been ups and 
downs, but you're always there." 
</P>
<P>
The old Temptations dance-flash wasn't all there. The threesome got some rises 
out of the crowd with synchronized whirls and hand-rolls, but the steps were a 
little creaky at times. In the age of MTV dance pyrotechnics, it's hard to get 
steamed up over comparatively sedate Motown moves. Then again, the likes of 
Paula Abdul and Janet Jackson only move their bodies. The Temptations songbook 
still moves the emotions and delights the ear, even when the singers aren't all 
they used to be.

OCC CHORALE MIXES THE SERIOUS AND THE SEASONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange Coast College Chorale holiday program brought good tidings to all 
who had pondered the choir's fate now that founder Richard Raub has 
relinquished the podium. Saturday night at Robert B. Moore Theatre on the OCC 
campus, with conductor Ted Reid manning the helm, the chorale offered a 
balanced mixture of the serious and the seasonal. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Coast Chorale is a community-based group. Yet Raub never pandered to 
amateur status, preferring to challenge his ensemble with such major works as 
Bach's B-minor Mass and Verdi's Requiem. Reid indicated his intent to continue 
tackling masterworks by programming Bach's Magnificat in D as the centerpiece 
Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Like most community choirs, the OC Chorale has rough edges, particularly an 
eagerness to sing out even when dynamic restraint might be more effective. The 
Magnificat, especially, suffered from this (the one time Reid successfully 
insisted on a soft entrance, for "Suscepit Israel," the sopranos stumbled in 
thin and ragged). 
</P>
<P>
Failure to shape phrases or to etch softly subtle lines impeded communication 
of dark moods such as those required by the "Magnificat anima mea" and the 
"Suscepit Israel" choruses. But fresh-faced fervor conveyed much of the spirit 
of other sections. The "Fecit potentiam" and the final strains of the "Gloria 
Patri" glistened with joyful energy. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Reid elicited two qualities that set his choir apart from other 
non-professional groups: a consistent blending of tone among the sections, and 
clear, coordinated enunciation. Besides conveying text easily, refined 
placement of consonants permitted sudden, perfectly unified cut-offs, such as 
that which followed the florid imitation of the chorus "Fecit potentiam." 
</P>
<P>
As in previous years, professional soloists -- in this case, soprano Laura 
Fries, mezzo soprano Elizabeth Saunders, tenor Dale Tracy, and baritone Ralph 
Cato -- and free-lance instrumentalists teamed forces with the chorus. In the 
Magnificat, none of the vocal soloists emerged as rising stars, though Tracy's 
securely sustained line and even tone drew a sense of pathos from "Et 
misericordia," his duet with Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
The second half of the program was devoted to traditional Christmas pieces, 
arrangements of Christmas songs, and the now-common audience sing-along. Faced 
with less technically demanding works, the choir did manage soft legato lines, 
especially in Robert Young's "There Is No Rose" and the closing "Amen" of Ralph 
Vaughan Williams' "Fantasia on Christmas Carols." In the latter, Cato provided 
a rich, commanding solo.

ROYALS GET DAVIS FOR $13 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
KANSAS CITY, Mo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Davis agreed to a $13 million four-year contract with the Kansas City 
Royals today, making them the first team to start a season with the reigning Cy 
Young Award winners. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City signed free agent Storm Davis last week to a $6-million three-year 
deal. He won 19 games last season for the World Series champion Oakland 
Athletics; the two Davises join a pitching staff that already includes American 
League Cy Young winner Bret Saberhagen (23-6), Mark Gubicza (15-11) and Tom 
Gordon (17-9). 
</P>
<P>
Mark Davis was 4-3 with 44 saves and a 1.85 earned-run average for the San 
Diego Padres with 92 strikeouts in 92 2/3 innings. He had a win or a save in 48 
of San Diego's 89 victories. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego decided not to sign the 29-year-old Davis after free agent reliever 
Craig Lefferts agreed to a $5.35-million three-year contract on Thursday. The 
Padres offered $12 million over four years, but Davis asked for $14 million. 
San Diego owner Joan Kroc said the team would not raise its offer, so Davis 
looked for a new club.

Kansas City, which finished seven games behind Oakland, made only the 
fifth-best offer, according to Randy Hendricks, Davis' agent. But Davis thought 
the Royals were a better team to pitch for than the New York Yankees and 
Philadelphia, two teams that are known to have made five-year offers.

Davis, who made $600,000 in 1989, gets a $1.5-million signing bonus, $1.75 
million in 1990 and $3.25 million in each of the next three seasons. He can 
earn bonuses of $100,000 for the Cy Young Award, $100,000 for the Rolaids 
Relief Man award, $100,000 for Most Valuable Player, $50,000 for playoff MVP, 
$50,000 for World Series MVP and $50,000 for making the All-Star team.

His $3.25 million annual average salary broke the record of $3.2 million set 
only 10 days earlier by Mark Langston, who got $16 million for five years from 
California. This is the fourth time the record has been broken in the last 
month, and Davis may not remain at the top because free agent Robin Yount has 
not yet signed.

Davis becomes the stopper in a bullpen led last year by Jeff Montgomery and 
Steve Farr, who had 18 saves each.
