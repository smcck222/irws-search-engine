LAB WHERE SURGEONS PRACTICED ON DOGS SHUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Animal-rights activists said Monday they are "thrilled" over the decision by 
doctors at UC San Diego to close a controversial dog lab, in which physicians 
practiced surgical techniques on canines. 
</P>
<P>
The course had been offered for three years through UCSD's Office of Continuing 
Medical Education. Despite protests, the course was conducted several times 
yearly at a cost of $300 per person. 
</P>
<P>
"We had targeted the course since its inception and were supported in our 
efforts by physicians across the country," said Jane Cartmill, associate 
director of San Diego Animal Advocates, which spearheaded the protests. "Many 
physicians argued that the course was unnecessary, was not educationally useful 
and had nothing to do with research. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, we're thrilled it's closing. It's like a Christmas present for animal 
rights' groups." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Franz, a spokeswoman for UCSD, said the lab was closed because 
"additional security" and "additional administrative supervision" -- in 
response to to the protests -- made the projected fee for the course 
"completely prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
Franz said the contract for the course was up, and UCSD officials determined 
that they could no longer offer it "on anything approaching a break-even 
basis." Franz said enrollment had declined because of doctors obtaining such 
training elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But animal rights activist Cartmill said it was "no coincidence" that the 
course was canceled before yet another scheduled protest tonight. She said the 
outcry had been aided by several national groups, including In Defense of 
Animals, the International Society for Animal Rights and Friends of Animals. 
</P>
<P>
She credited "bad publicity" and "dwindling attendance" with killing the 
course, which was called Advanced Emergency Procedures Symposium. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, these people were practicing surgical techniques on dogs, then killing 
them," Cartmill said. "But the course was criticized on two levels. Physicians 
were saying that doctors who couldn't do such (surgical) procedures weren't 
about to master them in two hours on a dog, then transfer the knowledge to a 
person. And, of course, many doctors felt the course was just wrong." 
</P>
<P>
She said dozens of San Diego physicians supported the effort, as did the 
Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington. In August of last 
year, protests led to two members of Cartmill's group being arrested on, among 
other charges, suspicion of trespassing.

ROCKET TEST SITE EXPLOSION HURTS MAN, STARTS FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An explosion caused by a liquid oxygen spill at a Rockwell International test 
site near Simi Valley injured a worker and triggered a small brush fire, 
Ventura County fire officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The brush fire broke out shortly after the 4:12 p.m. explosion at Rockwell's 
Santa Susana Field Laboratory, company spokesman Paul Sewell said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze consumed less than an eighth of an acre about five miles south of 
Simi Valley and was under control within half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Sewell said the accident occurred when the worker, who was pumping liquid 
oxygen from a 28,000-gallon tank, spilled some of the highly explosive 
material. 
</P>
<P>
The worker, whose name was not released, suffered a minor cut on his hand and 
was taken to Humana Hospital West Hills for treatment. Officials suspect that 
the explosion was due to equipment failure or human error. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a hazardous procedure under normal circumstances. This is something 
that's been done literally a thousand times," Sewell said. 
</P>
<P>
Sewell said investigators have secured the area, a test site for booster rocket 
engines used in satellite launches. A test scheduled for today has been 
canceled until Rockwell completes the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 Ventura County firefighters and a crew of eight Rockwell firefighters 
responded to the brush fire.

RESERVES JOIN MARINES ON ACTIVE DUTY; 
</P>
<P>
PORT HUENEME: WEAPONS COMPANY IS PART OF THE FIRST INFANTRY UNIT FROM SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA TO BE CALLED UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A Marine Corps Reserve unit of 150 men reported for active duty at Port Hueneme 
on Monday, packed up its impressive array of firepower and shipped out for 
Okinawa by way of Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
"We are part of the first infantry reserve unit to be activated from Southern 
California," said Capt. Hobie N. Smith Jr., commanding officer of the weapons 
company based at Port Hueneme's Naval Construction Battalion Center. 
</P>
<P>
Assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Marine Regiment, the company is trained to 
transport the heaviest human-carried weapons onto the battlefield for its 
battalion. 
</P>
<P>
Among other weapons, its arsenal includes the Mark 19 weapon that fires 
40-millimeter shells capable of penetrating 2-inch-thick steel, the M47 Dragon 
anti-armor guided missile designed to destroy tanks, and an 81-millimeter 
mortar that delivers the impact of a small bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to Okinawa and we can't speculate after that," Smith said, 
surveying his troops packing the arsenal to be shipped overseas. "All I can say 
is we're ready for anything." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's gung-ho attitude was not reflected in many of the worried faces of 
Marine reservists called for 180 days of active duty by the branch of the 
military that takes pride in being first into battle. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us are students and this is disrupting our lives," said Lance Cpl. 
Temujin Jones, a sophomore at Cal State Los Angeles. Jones and Lance Cpl. 
Douglas Smith of Ventura, both heavy-machine gunners, said they've known for 
weeks that the call-up was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the attitude that you could get in a traffic accident or be stabbed or 
mugged, so there is risk every day," said Smith, 21, an assistant manager of 
the Skating Plus roller skating rink in Ventura. "Of course, there is greater 
risk on the front lines." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Richard T. Johnson said Monday's deployment was the first time for most 
of the citizen-soldiers to be called to active duty. "This is going into the 
great unknown for them," said Johnson, an active-duty Marine who coordinates 
the weapons company activities at Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
The call came as a surprise to some of the more experienced reservists too. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't expected it, that's for sure," said Capt. Tom C. Luke of Thousand 
Oaks, commander of the company's mortar platoon. Luke said he is concerned 
about the viability of two businesses that he started since leaving active duty 
for the reserves in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my druthers, I'd rather not go," said Luke, 29, a Naval Academy 
graduate. He said he is relying on friends and business partners to take care 
of his businesses while he is away. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the 150 Marines in the weapons company come from Ventura, Santa 
Barbara and Los Angeles counties. The unit has an average age of 22 years, and 
only 26 of the reservists are married. "There is one married Marine whose wife 
is pregnant," Smith said. "That's mine." His wife is expecting their first 
child in January. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Camp Pendleton for last-minute training with the rest of the 
1,000-man reserve battalion, the weapons company held a demonstration of its 
firepower on the Seabee base. 
</P>
<P>
"We've stepped up our training in recent weeks and spent a great deal of time 
at Camp Pendleton and Twentynine Palms," Smith said. "At least 50% of our time 
is spent training at night." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Smith nor any other Marine officers would speculate on whether the 
battalion would go to Saudi Arabia to be part of the 400,000-troop U.S. buildup 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
But Pentagon strategists have made sure Saudi-bound troops have up-to-date 
training in the latest high-tech gear for night maneuvers. These strategists 
have suggested that U.S. forces, equipped with night-vision goggles and other 
gear, would have the advantage in night battles.

SPLIT COUNCIL NAMES FILNER DEPUTY MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a decision certain to create more discord on the divided San Diego City 
Council, an unusual coalition of council members Monday elected Councilman Bob 
Filner the city's deputy mayor for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
The primarily ceremonial post, largely ignored by city residents but 
occasionally the cause of political bloodshed among council members, was sought 
by longtime rivals Filner and Councilman Ron Roberts. Roberts came up on the 
short end of a 5-4 vote to elect him deputy mayor and lost his chairmanship of 
the council committee that oversees land use and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
In another matter that has deeply divided the council, it was disclosed Monday 
that the private attorney who represented council members Filner, Linda 
Bernhardt and John Hartley in this summer's battle over reapportionment is 
demanding more than $100,000 in legal fees from the city for services the city 
attorney offered free. 
</P>
<P>
David Lundin, who represented the trio during federal court hearings on the 
redrawing of district lines, has asked the city for $104,000 in fees, according 
to sources who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
The information came to light during a council debate over payments to 
attorneys for the Chicano Federation, which sued the city in federal court over 
the new district boundary lines, claiming that the system proposed by the 
council majority discriminated against Latinos. The lawsuit was settled out of 
court after adjustments that increased the percentage of Latinos in Filner's 
8th District. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Chief Deputy Atty. Jack Katz told the council that he has received a 
demand for the fees, but, despite questioning from O'Connor, declined to reveal 
how much Lundin is seeking. Katz also said the council could be sued over the 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said, however, that Lundin is demanding $104,000 and that attorney 
James McIntyre, who represented council members Ron Roberts and Judy McCarty, 
is asking $10,000. O'Connor's attorney has asked for $3,000, but O'Connor said 
Monday that she would personally pay the fee. Henderson's attorney, Pat 
McCormick, has also put in a claim for fees, but the amount was made available. 
</P>
<P>
With the council divided, 5 to 4, on the redistricting last summer, City Atty. 
John Witt's office told the majority at the time that city lawyers could 
represent them -- Filner, Bernhardt, Hartley and council members Wes Pratt and 
Abbe Wolfsheimer. But only Roberts, O'Connor, Henderson and McCarty were 
entitled to city reimbursement for their attorneys, Witt said, because they 
were not responsible for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
But Lundin, who said in an interview Monday that his three clients will be 
asking for the payments "in due course," disagreed. Even council members on the 
majority side of the vote were entitled to private counsel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to discuss the issue in closed session today. O'Connor 
demanded a written opinion from Witt's office on whether the three council 
members could vote to spend city money on their own attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted to pay Chicano Federation attorneys $180,000 as part of 
the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on the deputy mayor's post and committee chairmanships, coming on the 
penultimate council session of the year, continued the friction among council 
factions that began with the same issues almost exactly 12 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
On the day they were sworn into office in 1989, newcomers Bernhardt and Hartley 
joined Filner, Pratt and Wolfsheimer to force Henderson out of the chairmanship 
of the council committee that oversees city parkland, claiming that he was not 
sensitive to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The vote incensed O'Connor, who said she had been betrayed by Bernhardt. 
Relations between O'Connor and the majority faction have never improved. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's victim was Roberts, considered by some the front-runner to replace 
O'Connor as mayor when her term ends in 1992. Henderson and Filner are also 
said to be interested in running for mayor, though Henderson said Monday that 
he has no plans now to do so. All three face elections for their council seats 
next year, along with Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to losing the deputy mayor's race and his committee chairmanship, 
Roberts narrowly staved off a bid by Henderson to replace him on the San Diego 
Assn. of Governments' aviation policy committee. Roberts' district includes 
Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy mayor often presides at ceremonial functions and oversees 
administration of the council offices. Perhaps more importantly, the deputy 
mayor leads council meetings when the mayor is absent. Opinions differ on 
whether the post is a political asset. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts declined to criticize his colleagues' motives, but O'Connor praised him 
lavishly and lectured the council in a written statement prepared before 
Monday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron Roberts could have provided some much needed harmony and polish to the 
council," O'Connor said in a statement that never mentioned Filner by name. "We 
have a problem because we have behaved in the worst tradition of political 
greed at precisely the time when restraint was needed." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, O'Connor said of Filner, "We have no relationship, and it's 
intentional on my side. I don't like his politics, and I don't think they're in 
the best interests of the city." 
</P>
<P>
The unusual aspect of Monday's vote was the lineup of council members, with 
Henderson and McCarty, who often allied with Roberts, casting the key votes 
that denied Roberts the deputy mayor's post. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer, Hartley, Henderson, McCarty and Filner voted against Roberts' 
nomination, with O'Connor, Bernhardt, Pratt and Roberts voting in favor. In a 
second vote, McCarty also voted against Filner, along with Roberts and 
O'Connor. But Filner was joined by Wolfsheimer, Hartley, Pratt, Bernhardt and 
Henderson to win the spot. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of Filner's appointment has sparked charges that he engineered 
private deals with council members Judy McCarty and Bruce Henderson on recent 
issues facing the council -- charges that all three council members have 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson and Filner have clashed bitterly over the reapportionment, in which 
Filner helped to shoehorn Henderson into a district that will make his 
reelection bid more difficult next year. But Henderson said that Roberts' 
opposition to Henderson's pet project, a growth-control plan for Pacific Beach, 
caused more enmity. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Deputy Mayor Wolfsheimer was chosen to replace Roberts on the 
council's Transportation and Land Use committee, and McCarty will replace 
Filner as chairman of the council's Public Facilities and Recreation Committee. 
Pratt will keep his chairmanship of the council's Public Services and Safety 
Committee.

33 VOLUNTEERS TRAIN FOR QUAKE EMERGENCY DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If an earthquake were to shake Ventura County this week, emergency response 
teams would be much better prepared than they were a week ago, said Lt. Arve 
Wells of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the county Fire Department trained 33 members of the 
Sheriff's Department's volunteer search and rescue team to deal with a 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Trainees include search and rescue volunteers from Ojai, Fillmore, the eastern 
portion of the county and the Los Padres area of Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers gathered at Fire Station 50 at the Camarillo Airport to learn how to 
move heavy objects, rescue victims from holes and trenches and evacuate victims 
from buildings. Lessons were conducted in a classroom and in the field. 
</P>
<P>
"This is designed not to have the volunteers replace existing Fire Department 
personnel, but to augment them," Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to be anticipatory. We don't want to suffer the fate of other 
departments and look back afterward and wish we would have trained additional 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Sandi Wells of the Ventura County Fire Department pointed out the importance of 
dispersing trained rescuers countywide. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at where the faults lie and you see that some areas could be 
completely isolated," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our stations are outlying and these guys would be available to assist. 
They would be available to each other." 
</P>
<P>
With a similar training program conducted last month, a total of 54 volunteers 
have been trained, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
"The plans are to periodically reinforce the training to maintain efficiency," 
Wells said. "This isn't just a one-shot thing." 
</P>
<P>
The training will include simulating a rescue from a collapsed building in 
January. LEO SMITH

APPEAL HEARING TO BEGIN OVER DEPUTY'S FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Sheriff's Department deputy who allegedly made 794 personal, 
long-distance calls from county phones is appealing his dismissal from the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
James Winstead's appeal hearing before the county Civil Service Commission is 
scheduled to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has the authority to overturn the department's dismissal, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Winstead was fired on Aug. 16 after being accused of dishonesty, 
insubordination, failure of good behavior and acts incompatible with public 
service, according to an Aug. 15 notice of termination written by Assistant 
Sheriff Richard S. Bryce. 
</P>
<P>
But Winstead said he never intended to defraud the county and that he believed 
that the phone calls were acceptable because other deputies also use the county 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was under so much stress he never thought about the telephone calls 
he made to deal with misfortunes that befell his wife, who was then living in 
Arizona with his stepdaughter. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy racked up $739.13 in telephone bills during 104.3 hours of 
conversations to Phoenix between July 16, 1989, and May 1, 1990, Bryce said in 
the letter. 
</P>
<P>
A comparison of shift rosters and telephone statements shows Winstead spent a 
minimum of 36 hours and 22 minutes on the telephone to Arizona while he was on 
duty, Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
On one day, the deputy made as many as 28 calls to Arizona. The majority of the 
calls were to his home phone in north Phoenix, Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
His dismissal followed other reprimands, Bryce said. They included a seven-day 
suspension in October, 1989, after department officials accused Winstead of 
being inefficient and dishonest with a superior, as well as two verbal 
reprimands in July and May, 1989, for an alleged failure to report to duty, 
according to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1990, Winstead was interviewed about the phone use, Bryce said. At the 
conclusion of the interview he was ordered to refrain from using the county 
phone system to make personal calls. 
</P>
<P>
About two weeks later, Bryce said, Winstead told a supervisor that he had made 
two more personal calls to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Winstead said he had moved his wife and stepdaughter to Arizona with the 
intention of joining them someday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his wife was diagnosed with hepatitis, had a miscarriage, was 
involved in a bad automobile accident and lost a relative to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like there were mitigating circumstances they never considered," 
Winstead said. CAROL WATSON

<P>
Two explosions at a house in a remote area of Camarillo on Monday caused 
extensive damage to the house and minor damage to an adjacent mobile home, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents Marjorie and Mario Martinez were inside the house when they heard two 
blasts and discovered flames at the back of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials believe that the fire may have been caused by a propane tank 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were hampered in fighting the blaze because of winds of 20 m.p.h. 
and a lack of water on the property. Water had to be brought in by truck. 
</P>
<P>
There was no estimate of damage, but fire officials said there were many 17th- 
and 18th-Century antiques inside the house. Also on the property was a 1965 
Buick, which had recently been restored. The car was destroyed. GERRY BRAILO

Doctors had told Vera Moran of Redondo Beach in recent years that she had only 
a 1% chance of becoming pregnant. But she and husband, Luis, who married in 
1974, still dreamed of conceiving a child. Their dream came true over the

Nothing seemed more wasteful to the workers at the Azusa Land Reclamation

Lawyer John Welch's jogging track is the stairway of the 73-floor First 
Interstate Tower. A mountain climber, he stays in shape by making a daily run 
from his 6th floor office to the 72nd floor in under 10 minutes -- an 
impressive time for a 21-year-old, let alone a 70-year-old such as Welch.

<P>
To honor the ritual, his firm -- Latham &amp; Watkins -- inaugurated the first 
annual John Welch Memorial Stairwell Ascent, a mere 39-floor dash. Seventy 
runners, including Welch, his daughter and two grandchildren, competed the 
other night in T-shirts bearing the event's logo.

<P>
The winner was attorney / jogger Alan Chabot, 28, who got so caught up in the 
spirit of the thing that he climbed all 73 floors in 13:30. The biggest 
problem, he said, was avoiding head-on collisions with employees using the 
stairways to exit the building.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LEMON GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge rejected the pleas Monday of a 19-year-old stabbing victim who wanted 
the defendant, her boyfriend, to be released from jail. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Charles Williams, 24, of San Diego received a state prison term of 
seven years and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Williams had been charged with rape and attempted murder in the attack, but he 
pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I would agitate him, because I know how he is," the 19-year-old 
woman said in court. "I had a knife too. I was going to stab him before he was 
going to stab me." 
</P>
<P>
The woman said Williams stabbed her in self-defense while at her Lemon Grove 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
She asked for Williams to be freed immediately, but acknowledged, "I know he 
did wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"You want this man released?" asked Municipal Judge William D. Mudd. "And you 
came within a millimeter of death." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he could still see the scars around her neck where an artery was 
slashed, and noted for the court record that she had been stabbed in the head, 
which might have broken the knife found at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"You're lucky to be standing here," said the judge. "I don't really know what 
makes you tick. I think you've got a death wish." 
</P>
<P>
But the victim, insisting "he's not dangerous," said she will continue her 
relationship with Williams through prison and they might end up living together 
again when he is paroled. 
</P>
<P>
Mudd said he hopes that some day in the future he will not read "over morning 
coffee . . . about your death."

SHERIFF DENIES GUARDS FORMED GANG TO BEAT UP BLACK INMATES; 
</P>
<P>
CASTAIC: A SIX-MONTH INQUIRY FINDS THAT 'WAYSIDE WHITIES' WAS JUST A MOCKING 
NAME FOR WHITE GUARDS. BUT A FORMER PRISONER WHO SAYS THEY BROKE HIS LEG HAS 
SUED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allegations that white guards at a Castaic jail formed a gang called the 
"Wayside Whities" that intimidated and beat black inmates are unfounded, 
according to a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department internal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The six-month investigation, headed by a black detective, determined that the 
name "Wayside Whities" was coined by black gang members as a mocking gang-like 
label for white deputies who serve as guards at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor 
Rancho. A black inmate told deputies about the nickname and taught some 
deputies a gang-like hand signal simulating the letter W. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said two deputies acknowledged flashing the signal at black 
inmates a couple of times, but said it was not done in an intimidating manner. 
The internal affairs division investigation concluded that no sheriff's 
policies or regulations were violated by the deputies and no disciplinary 
action has been taken. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation of deputies at the Pitchess jail -- formerly the Wayside 
Honor Rancho -- was prompted by a former inmate who said members of a guard 
group called the "Wayside Whities" took him out of an inmate dormitory for 
fighting with a white inmate on Dec. 2, 1989, then beat him. 
</P>
<P>
Clydell Crawford, 26, of West Covina said that as he lay prone, deputies jumped 
on his leg, breaking it. Crawford filed a $1-million civil rights lawsuit 
against Sheriff Sherman Block and 12 deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, which is expected to go to trial next year, describes the "Wayside 
Whities" as a "Ku Klux Klan-type organization espousing white supremacy and 
having as one of its objectives the subjugation, intimidation and 
terrorization" of black inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"The investigation didn't show anything like that at all," said Sgt. Edward 
Allen, who headed the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said the term "Wayside Whities" originated with a black inmate who was 
being interviewed by a deputy assigned to the jail's gang identification unit, 
who was trying to learn as much as possible about gang habits and culture. The 
inmate told the deputy that gang members in the jail had a nickname for white 
guards and showed the deputy the W hand sign. 
</P>
<P>
"The inmates developed the hand sign and the term to identify the whites," 
Allen said. "It was a means to taunt the deputies." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said dozens of inmates and deputies interviewed during the investigation 
said inmates routinely made the hand sign at jailers. However, the 
investigators said only two deputies, both assigned at the time to the gang 
identification unit, acknowledged using the sign and said they did it to 
establish rapport with gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford's attorney, George V. Denny, disputed the sheriff's findings and said 
he will continue to press the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of several other cases in which inmates have been badly, badly beaten," 
Denny said. "The information that I have is that it is not the black people who 
make the W sign. It is the white deputies. That sign is regularly flashed by 
deputies. It is not done in fun or jest, but for intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Philip Abner, also of the internal affairs division, investigated 
Crawford's allegations that he was beaten and that his leg was intentionally 
broken by deputies and also concluded that the allegation was unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
Abner said the three guards involved in the scuffle reported after the incident 
that the fight broke out when Crawford attacked a deputy investigating an 
inmate fight. Two other deputies ran to the first jailer's aid and one struck 
Crawford in the leg with a flashlight, unintentionally breaking it, Abner said. 
</P>
<P>
Abner said 30 inmates interviewed during the investigation gave conflicting 
reports on the fight, but two people who worked in the hospital where Crawford 
was treated said the inmate told them that he was struck by a flashlight, not 
jumped on when he was already down.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some Simi Valley residents will have to pay about $1 more a month in trash 
collection fees under a plan approved Monday night by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the rate hike requests from American-Simi Rubbish Co. and 
Anderson Rubbish Co. following a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
An annual hearing is required to evaluate service and to consider any proposed 
rate increases or other changes in the companies' contracts with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements approved Monday, American-Simi Rubbish, which serves about 
24,000 customers, will be allowed to raise its monthly rate from $13 to $14.10. 
Its senior citizen rate will increase from $10.20 a month to $11.05 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson Rubbish, which serves 2,000 customers, will increase its monthly rate 
from $13 to $14.05, while senior citizen rates will jump from $10.20 a month to 
$11.05. 
</P>
<P>
The trash haulers cited increased fuel costs and increases in tipping fees at 
the Simi Valley landfill as the primary reasons for the rate hikes. Dumping 
fees will increase from $30.10 to $34.60 per ton beginning Jan. 1. CARLOS V.

YOUTH PLEADS GUILTY TO AVOID 2ND TRIAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old Mexican immigrant pleaded guilty Monday in Ventura County 
Superior Court to charges that he stabbed a Thousand Oaks nurseryman to death 
last spring "in the heat of passion," according to the charge. 
</P>
<P>
A jury found Jose Luis Navarro not guilty last week of first-degree murder in 
the slaying of Jose Narvaez, 49. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Charles R. McGrath declared a mistrial when jurors announced that 
they were deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of acquitting Navarro of second-degree 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro decided to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter and use of a deadly 
weapon because he wanted to avoid another trial, said his lawyer, Deputy Public 
Defender Steve P. Lipson. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him Friday and he said he thought about it from . . . when the partial 
verdict came in and he said he didn't want to go through another trial," Lipson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro testified at his trial that he had sodomized Narvaez on the night of 
April 19. But he told jurors that he stabbed Narvaez in self-defense when 
Narvaez tried forcibly to sodomize him. 
</P>
<P>
Narvaez was stabbed once in the stomach and three times in the back with a 9 
1/2-inch butcher knife. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the jurors believed that "there was an element of self-defense" in 
the slaying, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes said Monday. "The vote of the 
jury was five for second-degree murder and when you don't have a majority on 
the first go-round there's going to be obvious difficulties to get all 12 on 
the second" trial, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes said Navarro faces four to 12 years in state prison. Sentencing is 
scheduled for Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro was in this country illegally and faces certain deportation upon his 
release from prison, Holmes said. MACK REED

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOUSEHOLD TOXIC WASTE REPORT IS ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council panel Monday ordered city officials to return next 
week with a report on funding a program to collect household hazardous wastes 
from homeowners before the items end up in the regular trash. 
</P>
<P>
The council's Environmental Quality and Waste Management Committee also sided 
with residents who live near Lopez Canyon, the city-owned landfill in the 
northeast San Fernando Valley, in expressing unhappiness that the city's 
fledgling household hazardous waste pickup program has been stalled. 
</P>
<P>
The city has $957,000 in its budget for such a clean-up plan, but it will 
require a City Council vote to free the funds for expenditure. Presently, 
release of the funds depends on completion of a report on ways to handle the 
expensive job of collecting and disposing of such wastes.

COUNCIL MAKES TRAM SYSTEM IN BALBOA PARK PERMANENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking to keep motorists out of Balboa Park's congested core, the San Diego 
City Council on Monday agreed to create a permanent tram system for the heavily 
used park. 
</P>
<P>
The vote follows successful pilot projects during the summers of 1989 and 1990, 
in which trams ferried visitors from outlying parking lots into the park's 
center. 
</P>
<P>
In a one-day count last summer, 1,000 people rode the tram system, said David 
Twomey, assistant director of the city's Park and Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
The contract with Old Town Trolley Tours of San Diego, which will operate the 
tram, calls for three vehicles to serve the park during peak summer periods, 
with fewer in service when the park is less heavily used. 
</P>
<P>
The $437,000 allocation approved Monday will pay for 18 months of tram service 
starting April 13, retrofitting of two vehicles to accommodate wheelchairs, and 
other start-up costs. The council must allocate more money if it wishes to 
continue the service after Oct. 31, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The tram will run every day in a circuit that will provide a vehicle every 
eight to 10 minutes during peak summer hours and every 24 minutes in winter. 
Motorists will be encouraged to park at Inspiration Point. At least initially, 
the service will be free. 
</P>
<P>
The council had contacted the McDonald's restaurant chain to determine if it is 
interested in sponsoring the tram, but the company, which was rebuffed by the 
council in an earlier bid to sponsor the vehicles in return for placing a 
restaurant in the park, declined.

IF AMERICA EVER RUNS OUT OF IDEAS, IT'LL RUN OUT OF ENERGY; 
</P>
<P>
TIME TO PUT NUCLEAR POWER IN PERSPECTIVE AND DEVELOP OTHER OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States will not soon break petroleum's stranglehold on its way of 
life because it has nothing to take the place of oil. Why? In large part 
because political and industrial leaders have refused to level with American 
voters. Instead, they led Americans to think they can avoid hard energy 
choices, on nuclear power or any other energy source. Instead, they led them 
into an energy trap. 
</P>
<P>
Disposing of nuclear waste is just one example. For nearly two decades, the 
nuclear industry preached that getting rid of nuclear waste was more a matter 
of political will than technical skill. If politicians would stop pandering to 
public concerns about where to bury nuclear waste, the message went, safe 
hiding places would be found in short order. 
</P>
<P>
You don't hear that sermon anymore. Not since Nevada's Yucca Mountain, the sole 
survivor of a long list of possible waste sites, began sending geological 
signals that it may not be the perfect place that scientists once said it was. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the bureaucrats were wrong about Washington's lack of backbone. 
</P>
<P>
Congress seized upon the general sentiment among Americans that nuclear power 
is a good thing -- as long as it is being generated far from their 
neighborhoods. Thus, members wanted to keep government geologists from poking 
around granite masses in their own Atlantic states or salt domes in states 
along the Gulf of Mexico. So they effectively put every place but Yucca 
Mountain off limits. 
</P>
<P>
The Yucca site, northwest of Las Vegas, no longer seems the perfect place, 
because there is some evidence that ancient earthquakes have let deep ground 
water force its way to the surface through cracks in the rock. If so, it could 
happen again. And if canisters of radioactive fuel rods were buried in the 
mountain, some future earthquake could send water into the Yucca nuclear waste 
burial site. If the ground water bathed canisters that were still hot, the 
encounter could cause a steam explosion that would scatter radioactivity around 
the West. Some scientists say this notion is far-fetched, but it could leach 
radioactive waste into Nevada's water table and perhaps into California's. 
</P>
<P>
Further study may show that Yucca is as safe as any place, or a better site may 
turn up. But that could take 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The 1982 law that narrowed the search to Yucca Mountain also requires 
scientists to certify that any disposal site the government chooses will stay 
bone dry for 10,000 years. Science can deliver no such guarantee, the National 
Academy of Sciences said in July, only the best possible research. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins had that figured out before the academy 
report was issued; his team was told to stop trying to find evidence to support 
Congress' choice of Yucca Mountain and was ordered to prepare a study based 
solely on science. 
</P>
<P>
What happened at Yucca is a classic example of energy decisions without energy 
policy. First, Congress picked a desert site so remote from most Americans that 
few members would get complaints from home. Technicians then tried to prove 
that burying nuclear waste was simple when politics did not interfere. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins' energy report may be Washington's last chance to level with Americans 
about their energy future. It must start a free-swinging debate over the real 
energy choices. It must force the nation to decide whether it can live with 
only a promise from science that it will do its best to bury nuclear waste 
safely. If not, does nuclear power have a real future? How much should be spent 
on alternative energy resources? And what should they be? 
</P>
<P>
Setting energy policy by following the line of least resistance is leading 
toward a buildup of 400,000 or more American troops in the Middle East, the 
world's largest treasure of oil. Guarding that treasure may be America's only 
choice, but the desperate fact is that nobody knows for sure -- because nobody 
asked the hard questions on energy policy. Time is up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GROWING POWER 
</P>
<P>

ELECTION COMING, SUPERVISOR GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's still theoretically possible that the U.S. Supreme Court will prolong the 
redistricting case against the L. A. County Board of Supervisors with further 
review and decision. But Monday's high court ruling allows the planned special 
election to go forward next month in the newly aligned 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
That means the board's membership will change no matter how the legalities are 
finally resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The high court has been the last hope of the conservative bloc that controls 
county government. They have been fighting this case for almost two years and 
the taxpayers' legal bills are at the $5-million mark. Both a federal judge in 
Los Angeles and an appeals court in San Francisco had agreed that the board 
discriminated when its five white, male members watered down potential Latino 
voting strength in 1981 to keep themselves in power. Monday the Supreme Court 
could have disagreed, but it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
The high court rejected an emergency request by the county to postpone the Jan. 
22 election to fill the 1st district seat currently held by retiring Supervisor 
Pete Schabarum. So even if the justices later decide to hear more legal 
arguments, it's curtains for Pete. And even if the high court ordered further 
hearings, all that's likely to change is the new district lines. The fact that 
county officials discriminated against the region's largest minority will 
remain a disgraceful part of the record. So, it appears, will the fact that the 
board majority stubbornly refused to give up when even the U.S. Supreme Court 
signaled that they were losers.

FREE THE 'KEATING FIVE'?; 
</P>
<P>
INOUYE HAD A POINT -- AND WHY THE ANSWER IS PUBLIC CAMPAIGN FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee may or may not conclude that California's Alan 
Cranston and others among the so-called "Keating Five" violated their chamber's 
standards of conduct when they intervened with federal regulators on behalf of 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan's former owner. But whatever the committee's 
decision, the testimony it has taken paints an intolerably squalid picture of 
business-as-usual in "the world's greatest deliberative body." 
</P>
<P>
It is, moreover, a squalor that will persist and deepen until the United States 
comes to grips not only with the acts alleged in this instance, but also with 
the way in which money is raised and spent in political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's case most clearly illustrates the point: Charles H. Keating Jr., the 
former thrift executive who now is an accused swindler, gave Cranston $60,000 
in direct campaign contributions, $85,000 for the California Democratic Party 
and $850,000 to support the activities of a voter registration group run by the 
senator's son, Kim. According to memorandums written by Cranston fund-raiser 
Joy Jacobson, some of that money was solicited during conversations in which 
the senator also promised to press Keating's cause with regulators 
investigating his spectacular mismanagement of Lincoln Savings. Failure to 
bring that 3-year probe to a timely conclusion ultimately saddled the American 
people with $2 billion in utterly unrecoverable costs from the thrift's 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's critics charge that his conduct breached a 38-year-old Senate 
standard requiring that campaign contributions not be solicited at the same 
time a favor is being done for the prospective donor. "Furthermore," wrote the 
standard's author, then-Sen. Paul Douglas, "a decent interval of time should be 
allowed to lapse so that neither party will feel that there is a close 
connection between the two acts." 
</P>
<P>
Neither, presumably, will the people -- which is why the Douglas standard 
better describes a public relations campaign than it does a code of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
During the course of this whole bleak affair, there has been no more melancholy 
sight than that of the distinguished senior senator from Hawaii, Daniel K. 
Inouye, testifying as a character witness for the five accused lawmakers. They 
had, Inouye said, done nothing that other senators do not routinely do. "I 
believe that what is on trial here are not the five colleagues of mine, but the 
United States Senate and, for that matter, the Congress of the United States," 
Inouye said. 
</P>
<P>
That was an honest, if not particularly edifying, admission. It describes a 
situation that will continue until the United States enacts a system of 
campaign spending limits and public campaign financing of the sort already 
adopted by progressive cities like Los Angeles.

DONATION TO L.A. CENTRAL LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Central Library: Check It Out" (Nov. 30) is in itself a "rather 
fabulous gift" to the many of us who labor to provide quality library services. 
</P>
<P>
The librarians in Los Angeles County join with you in applauding the Mark Taper 
Foundation's farsighted gift to Los Angeles Public Library's Central Library 
and to the citizens of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Three things emerge immediately from the content of your editorial. First, 
learning is an ongoing process and libraries are "ongoing learning 
laboratories." Second, library services extend far beyond the business of 
loaning out books and in fact embrace what has been called the Information Age. 
Third, learning and libraries can be, and are, "simply for the joy of 
learning." 
</P>
<P>
I would like to take this opportunity to remind readers there are 30 other 
public library jurisdictions operating in Los Angeles County, and I would 
encourage your readers to consider the multiplicity of worthy gift giving 
opportunities that remain unexplored. 
</P>

FARMS AND WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article "Are Farms Wasting Water" (Oct. 16) contains some misleading 
information about the price farmers pay to receive Federal Central Valley 
Project (CVP) water. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Reclamation delivers CVP water to water districts and other 
water-user organization. 
</P>
<P>
The directors in turn deliver water to their customers who are farmers and 
urban users stretching from Redding in Northern California to Bakersfield in 
the south. The districts and water agencies pay the $2.50 to $19.31 per 
acre-foot for water you cite in your article. 
</P>
<P>
We recently renegotiated one water service contract, originally signed in 1949, 
and raised the cost of water from $3.50 per acre-foot to $16.50 per acre-foot. 
Individual farmers in that district will be paying from $60 to $90 per 
acre-foot depending on pumping requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if those farmers lived in Los Angeles and we had to convey that same water 
an additional 200 miles and pump it 2,000 feet up over the mountains, the cost 
would certainly approach the $233 price you say Metropolitan pays the state for 
an acre-foot of Northern California water. 
</P>
<P>
To move one acre-foot of water from the San Joaquin Valley to Los Angeles would 
cost well over $100 in electrical charges alone. If you took that $100 and 
added the $90 per acre-foot of water the farmer pays, it would cost $190 to 
transport this water to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of water is a very complex issue involving construction, operation and 
maintenance of facilities and pumping.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
A CALL FOR COMPASSION AND SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deaths of two commuters at the Del Mar train station last week were 
accidents just waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
The aging station was designed for leisurely tourist travel. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is heavily used by Los Angeles-bound commuters, many of whom have to 
cross the tracks from one of two nearby parking lots -- an inherently risky 
layout that encourages using shortcuts. 
</P>
<P>
There's a sanctioned -- and safer -- place to walk across the tracks 25 yards 
away, where lights signal the trains' arrivals. Using it is a common- sense 
prescription indeed. 
</P>
<P>
But the station's daily use is incompatible with its design. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the dangerous shortcut at Del Mar is fenced off, commuters will still 
have to cross the tracks. And once the memories of Usha Waney and Roberta 
Halpern fade, many will make the dash. Amtrak calls these two women 
"trespassers." A more compassionate company would view them as victims. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego and Del Mar are the only stations along the route to Los Angeles 
where regularly used parking lots are located across the tracks. This should 
change in 1992, when a new Solana Beach station will replace the Del Mar stop. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably not practical to expect Amtrak to build a temporary overpass or 
underpass. But it is not unreasonable to expect the company to put up signs and 
look for other ways to help the passengers on one of its busiest routes.

PANEL REJECTS PORTION OF FAIRFAX PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Planning Commission last week rejected a proposed hotel 
and office building as too much development for the already congested streets 
of the Fairfax District, but decided to let the A. F. Gilmore Co. go ahead with 
a two-anchor retail mall behind the Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
Although spokesmen for some neighborhood groups said that a regional mall would 
be the ruination of the area, Planning Commission President William Luddy, who 
lives nearby, said that he saw it as a plus. 
</P>
<P>
"Fairfax has deteriorated. Neighborhood retail is drying up and dying," Luddy 
said. "This isn't Disney's Main Street. There aren't ticket sales to keep it 
going. There have to be people going into those stores." 
</P>
<P>
He said that City Council President John Ferraro's plan for the site, which 
calls for 700,000 square feet of development, amounts to "the least possible to 
still maintain an economically feasible project." At that size, the shopping 
center would be slightly smaller than the Beverly Center, one mile to the west. 
The developer originally proposed a project of 2 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Luddy said he believed a 700,000-square-foot development would produce enough 
revenue to pay for the extensive changes needed to mitigate many of the effects 
of extra traffic. 
</P>
<P>
But Diane Plotkin, president of the Beverly Wilshire Homes Assn., said: "There 
is no way to mitigate traffic in our area." 
</P>
<P>
She said city officials were hampered by "tunnel vision" that makes them judge 
individual projects in isolation from others proposed for the area, such as a 
major expansion planned by the owners of the nearby Park Labrea apartment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Luddy denied it, however, saying that the Park Labrea expansion could lessen 
the effects of traffic from the Farmers Market project by providing much-needed 
housing. The Planning Commission also proposed up to 400 housing units for the 
Farmers Market complex. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Gilmore, a family-owned company that has owned and operated the 
Farmers Market for decades, had appealed to the Planning Commission to overturn 
an earlier decision by a Planning Department official rejecting the hotel and 
office building. 
</P>
<P>
In its 5-0 vote Thursday afternoon, however, the Planning Commission dismissed 
the appeal out of hand. In effect, the commissioners adopted the 
recommendations offered by Ferraro in October, with modifications intended to 
increase the number of housing units to be built at the eastern end of the 
site, overlooking Pan Pacific Park.

BISHOP BROM URGES CONGRESS TO AVOID WAR WITH IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERNICE HIRABAYASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bishop Robert H. Brom, leader of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego, urged 
Congress on Monday to avoid using military force against Iraq, saying the 
United States must "seek a peaceful resolution of the crisis and pursue 
legitimate objectives by nonviolent diplomatic means." 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement read during a rally at the University of San Diego, 
Brom condemned Iraq's takeover of Kuwait, but stressed that the invaded 
country's biggest hope for peaceful liberation is through internationally 
applied sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that any actions taken against Iraq should not deprive civilians 
of food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Brom's statements, read by diocese spokeswoman Jeanne Ertle, were based on ones 
made during last month's national meeting of bishops in Washington. The 
National Council of Catholic Bishops became one of the first major U.S. 
organizations to challenge the Bush Administration's policy in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Brom was not able to attend the rally because of the short notice, Ertle said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's rally drew more than 150 students, who gathered in front of Hahn 
University Center in bright sunlight to listen to speakers talk about the gulf 
crisis. Student volunteers collected signatures for a petition as part of a 
statewide effort on university campuses to urge Congress and Bush to avoid war 
with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The signatures will be combined with those from similar rallies at UC San 
Diego, San Diego State University and Grossmont College, and will be presented 
to local members of Congress by New Year's, said rally organizer Robert 
Simmons, who teaches law at USD. 
</P>
<P>
"If war comes," Simmons said during the rally, "and the body bags start coming 
home, you and I will never forgive ourselves for the rest of our lives unless 
we do everything in our power now to prevent this war from occurring." 
</P>
<P>
Student speaker Anna Barhum warned that the United States should look at future 
relationships with countries in the Middle East rather than exploiting them for 
their natural resources. She said there are many options in the Persian Gulf 
crisis that have not been fully explored, such as letting the countries 
involved work out a solution for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to decide on our foreign policies and what image we want to present," 
she said. "We are perceived as being the bully. Saddam Hussein is seen as a 
hero just for standing up to us." 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam veteran Terry Hertzler warned students that, if there is a war, chances 
are they will be fighting it. 
</P>
<P>
"War is sometimes inevitable," he said, "but I think it has to be the absolute, 
final option we can choose, because of what it does to all of us. . . . Wars 
aren't pretty." 
</P>
<P>
Hertzler visits college campuses each semester to teach students about the 
Vietnam War. He said today's students in some ways are more sophisticated than 
he was at age 18, but in other ways are much more naive. 
</P>
<P>
"To many students, the Vietnam War may as well be the Crimean War," he said. 
"It's ancient history in many ways. The students are very interested, but 
there's not a lot of knowledge out there. "

OAKLAND GETS SHOW WITH $2 MILLION PACT; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: SHOW, THE PADRES' ALL-TIME LEADING PITCHER, AGREES TO A TWO-YEAR 
GUARANTEED DEAL WITH OAKLAND.

<P>
Eric Show, who was unceremoniously dumped by the Padres in the off-season, 
signed a two-year guaranteed contract Monday night with the Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Show, the Padres' all-time leader with 100 career victories, is guaranteed $2 
million, and can earn another $500,000 in incentives, according to his agent, 
Arn Tellem. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sure of the circumstances around (free agents) Bobby Welch and Scott 
Sanderson," said Dave Duncan, A's pitching coach, "and of all the people out 
there, he was interested in us, and we were interested in him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to put in ink what role he'll play for us, but I expect that he will 
be a member of the starting rotation." 
</P>
<P>
The irony of the Athletics' acquisition is that the Padres did not feel Show, 
6-8, 5.76 ERA, still could pitch. They paid a $250,000 buyout in October rather 
than pick up the 1991 option year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres still have openings in their rotation and bullpen, but they are 
planning to offer contracts to free-agent reliever Larry Andersen and 
free-agent starter Danny Darwin, sources said. They also have offered salary 
arbitration to starter Dennis Rasmussen, and if he rejects the offer as 
expected, the Padres have until Jan. 8 to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
Show, who earned $800,000 this past season, would have had his option vested if 
he had pitched in 175 innings, but he wound up pitching 106 1/3 innings, 
bouncing in and out of the rotation. If the Padres had picked up his option, 
Show would have been allowed to file for an arbitration award worth $1.1 
million to $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, however, decided that he was not worth the money, and released him 
after the season. The Athletics had a different viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
"People in our organization saw him pitch, and really liked him," said Duncan, 
"especially the way he pitched at the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Show, recovering from a 1989 back operation in which a disc and several 
fragments were removed, lost five of his first six starts and was removed out 
of the rotation May 14. He pitched in relief, winning his first game July 4, 
and rejoined the rotation July 16. He made five more starts, going 2-2, and 
spent the rest of the year in long relief until the final game of the season.

'DOLPHIN-SAFE' CLAIMS REMAIN CAUSE FOR DEBATE

<P>
The "dolphin-safe" fishing agreement that the nation's three largest tuna 
canners endorsed April 12 delighted environmentalists who have, for years, 
campaigned against fishing techniques that killed dolphins. Overnight, it 
seemed, the nation's canners had defused a potentially explosive 
public-relations fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
But, early this month, Earth Island Institute, a San Francisco-based 
environmental group, rekindled the dolphin-safe debate in full-page newspaper 
advertisements that urged consumers to boycott Bumble Bee Seafoods for 
allegedly canning fish caught by methods that kill and maim dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at San Diego-based Bumble Bee promptly fought back with 
advertisements that defended their products as dolphin-safe as defined by 
widely accepted international guidelines. Mark Koob, Bumble Bee's president, 
said it is too early to determine if the proposed boycott has hurt sales. But 
Bumble Bee has urged consumers to boycott Earth Island by switching their 
financial support to "responsible environmental groups." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the dispute has been limited to Earth Island and Bumble Bee, and most 
other environmental groups have stayed out of the fray. But observers say the 
allegations underscore how difficult it will be for the tuna-canning industry 
and the multifaceted environmental community to erect and maintain a 
dolphin-safe verification system. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Bumble Bee, H.J. Heinz Co.'s Long Beach-based StarKist 
Seafoods division and San Diego-based Van Camp Seafood Co., which packages 
Chicken of the Sea, began shipping tuna in cans bearing "dolphin-safe" logos. 
</P>
<P>
But the federal government's dolphin-safe regulations won't be ready until next 
year, and environmentalists haven't yet defined what role they hope to play in 
the dolphin-safe labeling system. So canners have relied largely upon 
internally enforced mechanisms to ensure that only dolphin-safe tuna ends up on 
supermarket shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Koob said the lack of federal regulations has allowed some individual 
environmental organizations to "try to usurp" the federal government's role by 
demanding their their own, more-restrictive rules be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Earth Island has alleged that Bumble Bee and Unicord, Bumble Bee's Thai-based 
owner, have continued to accept tuna that are being caught by nets that kill 
dolphins. And the environmental group alleges that the companies are failing to 
document that their tuna-canning plants aren't accepting tuna caught by other 
methods known to harm dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Koob, in recent weeks, has repeatedly said that his company's verification 
records are open to "any responsible environmental groups." Unicord also has 
agreed to pay for an observer selected by the environmental community who would 
monitor Unicord's processing plants in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
If the dispute between Earth Island and Bumble Bee escalates -- or spreads to 
other environmental groups and canners -- consumers "just won't know who to 
believe," said Norman Dean, executive director of Washington-based Green Seal, 
a nonprofit organization that is developing an "environmental seal of approval" 
for deserving products. 
</P>
<P>
Green Seal has no plans to enter the dolphin-safe debate, but Dean said any 
"green" labeling that hopes to gain consumer trust would be undermined if the 
industry, environmentalists and regulators fail to agree upon uniform 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Unless agreement is reached, the fledgling dolphin-safe labeling program 
"probably won't achieve its goals, and nobody will win," Dean said. "This 
sounds like a case where people can get readily confused unless the issues are 
clearly defined." 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, relatively little disagreement remains between canners and 
environmentalists who, for decades have fought bitterly over the need for 
dolphin-safe fishing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
In April, canners agreed to accept fish caught in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, 
a triangular section of the Pacific Ocean bounded by San Diego, Chile and 
Hawaii, only from fishing vessels that carry third-party observers who will 
verify that tuna wasn't caught with giant seines that maim or kill dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
Those nets are believed to be especially damaging to dolphin populations in the 
Eastern Tropical Pacific because there, unlike anywhere else in the world, 
dolphin are often found swimming directly over schools of tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of the Eastern Tropical Pacific, canners agreed that fishing fleets 
should not use lengthy gill-and-drift nets to capture tuna because those 
so-called "entanglement nets" often kill or maim dolphin, which are unable to 
escape from schools of tuna. Canners argue that they have instituted internal 
checkpoints that ensure that they accept delivery only of tuna caught through 
dolphin-safe fishing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Koob maintained in interviews last week that Bumble Bee's dolphin-safe 
guidelines are modeled after U.N. tuna-fishing guidelines. He said the 
corporate rules were refined recently to accommodate concerns voiced by the 
Dolphin Coalition, a Washington-based alliance that includes nearly 40 
environmental groups. And Koob believes Bumble Bee's rules will be in keeping 
with federal regulations scheduled to come out next year. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists blame the tense situation on the fact that both canners and 
environmentalists are in "an awkward situation" because federal tuna-fishing 
regulations won't be in place until mid-1991. And, most environmental groups 
have yet to say how they will monitor the dolphin-safe claims made by packers. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphin Coalition will meet Wednesday in Washington to determine what role 
it might play in the continuing effort to ensure that canners stick to their 
dolphin-safe pledges. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Croft, director of the Dolphin Coalition, declined to comment on 
what will be discussed at the upcoming meeting. However, an advance agenda 
suggests that participants will try to determine criteria that must be met by 
canners in order to display dolphin-safe logos. The agenda also suggests that 
the Dolphin Coalition will consider the creation of its own dolphin-safe logo. 
</P>
<P>
Croft also declined to comment on the growing controversy generated by Earth 
Island, which is demanding that consumers boycott Bumble Bee and instead 
purchase Chicken of the Sea and StarKist brand tuna. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a Nov. 29 letter to Earth Island, Croft asked the San Francisco 
organization to refrain from "implicitly or directly suggesting that the 
Dolphin Coalition . . . is supporting the Bumble Bee protest." Croft's letter 
also suggested that "it is important that the (environmental) community 
evaluate the situation thoroughly . . . before forming a policy." 
</P>
<P>
And, in a recent letter to Unicord, Croft stated that the Dolphin Coalition has 
yet to reject or endorse any canners' claim to be processing dolphin-free tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists are worried that Earth Island's attack on Bumble Bee 
could prompt consumers to dismiss dolphin-safe labeling as an example of greedy 
corporations bending the truth to bolster their market share. 
</P>
<P>
Although most environmental groups have reserved judgment on dolphin-safe 
claims made by Bumble Bee, StarKist and Chicken of the Sea, environmentalists 
"don't want a cynical public to look upon dolphin-safe (labels) and not believe 
them," the environmentalist said. 
</P>
<P>
Green Seal, which was created by an environmentalist who helped to organize the 
first Earth Day in 1970s, believes that any certification program designed to 
gain consumer trust "will succeed or fail in the details," Dean said. "You want 
a system that's stable enough that people can trust it."

JUDGE APPROVES CLASS-ACTION SUIT AGAINST GREAT AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge granted class-action status Monday to a lawsuit filed by 
shareholders of ailing Great American Bank against former executives they claim 
ignored dire warnings about their 1986 plunge into Arizona's real estate boom. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Leland C. Nielsen refused to dismiss the two suits filed in 
tandem on behalf of three shareholders who claim the Great American executives 
ignored written warnings in 1986 about the purchase of an Arizona thrift and 
its allegedly shaky loan portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
"They elected to go ahead and, having done so, they should not be surprised 
that their shareholders call them into account for their actions," Bill Lerach, 
lead attorney for the plaintiffs, told Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
Settlement conferences were under way on the suits, which will likely not be 
ready for trial for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"There are conversations going on," said Robert Steiner, attorney for former 
Great American chairman Gordon Luce. "One always hopes." 
</P>
<P>
The suits seek damages from Luce and a number of former officers and directors, 
alleging that they violated their fiduciary duties and committed securities 
fraud from March 1986 to last February by artificially inflating the price of 
Great American's stock. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs' lawyers have said that Great American officials misrepresented 
the 1986 purchase of the ailing thrift Home Federal of Tucson, which placed 
Great American in the Arizona real estate market just before the state's land 
boom began to fizzle. 
</P>
<P>
An in-house due diligence report submitted in 1985 warned that Home Federal, 
which is not to be confused with the HomeFed Bank based in San Diego, was on 
shaky ground, had insufficient loan loss reserves and had apparently 
overestimated its profit projections by 39%. 
</P>
<P>
Great American, which lost a staggering $263.4 million in 1989, was forced to 
sell its California branch system to Wells Fargo last month for $491 million. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner argued that the suits did not prove reckless negligence on the part of 
Great American and that the slump in Arizona real estate was an unforeseeable 
event. 
</P>
<P>
"I raise a strong objection to the contention that somehow there has been 
criminal conduct," Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not dealing with a Keating or a Lincoln or a Vernon," he said, 
attempting to distance the still-functioning Great American from notorious 
thrift disasters in other parts of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
He argued that the Home Federal purchase, which gave Great American a branch 
system in Arizona at a time when the state was a lucrative market for 
out-of-town lenders, was a valid business decision. 
</P>
<P>
Although the amount of damages sought has been estimated at about $150 million, 
Lerach said the actual amount for which the defendants would be liable is hard 
to predict because of the effect market forces had on the value of Great 
American's stock. 
</P>
<P>
"They can point to every other savings and loan in the United States that has 
suffered serious stock price declines," Lerach said.

A PLAN THAT POINTED TO SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
RETAIL: LARRY IMPERIALE, 1986 WINNER OF SDSU'S BUSINESS PLAN COMPETITION, SAW A 
NICHE AMONG THE POINT-OF-SALE GIANTS AND FILLED IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not all winners of the annual San Diego State University business plan 
competition go on to start a business, much less become successful. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Imperiale did and is. 
</P>
<P>
His company, SalePoint, has become a leading producer of point-of-sale systems 
used by specialty retailers to track sales and inventory and to improve store 
operations. SalePoint expects to do more than $4 million in sales in 1990, only 
its third full year in business. SalePoint systems, which basically are cash 
registers linked to personal computers, consist of SalePoint-designed software 
and International Business Machines hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Imperiale's company has thrived despite heavy competition from corporate giants 
such as NCR, Fujitsu and IBM. Among SalePoint's successes are agreements to 
supply systems to retailers such as Williams-Sonoma, The Nature Company, 
Egghead Software and Universal Studios in California and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Imperiale, 32, attributes his success in large part to the annual SDSU business 
plan competition, which he won in 1986 shortly before receiving his masters in 
business administration degree. The young entrepreneur said the competition 
forced him to focus and concentrate his ideas in coming up with what became the 
blueprint for starting SalePoint in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Business plans are documents that entrepreneurs use to lay the groundwork for a 
new enterprise. The documents, which contain an array of market, technical and 
financial information, also serve as marketing tools used to attract capital 
from investors or lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, SDSU sponsors a competition to encourage business students to come 
to grips with the hard realities of starting up a new business and to foster 
the entrepreneurial spirit. The competition is held every December and is 
judged by an outside panel, including San Diego business executives, bankers, 
venture capitalists and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
For Imperiale, a Redwood City native who attended SDSU's graduate business 
school while holding down a full-time job at Triad Systems, his contest entry 
became "the vehicle for taking my idea and putting brackets around it." 
</P>
<P>
"The plan was a way of saying, here's how to go about doing it, forcing me to 
write it down, plan it out and anticipate all the obstacles I'd run into," 
Imperiale said. "Academically, (the contest) let me tie in everything I learned 
through my business school program through one exercise. That's what's lacking 
in most business schools. There is so much theoretical stuff that you lose 
touch with the pragmatic." 
</P>
<P>
The thesis of Imperiale's plan was that there was an opportunity in the retail 
point-of-sale market to develop a system suited to specialty retail stores. 
Imperiale knew what he was talking about: he was working in point-of-sale 
products for Triad Systems. 
</P>
<P>
At the time he wrote his plan, most of the advanced point-of-sale systems 
offered by IBM, NCR and others were targeting very large operations such as 
department stores that were likely to have 100 or more cash registers per 
location. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller stores and chains were being neglected, Imperiale said, because it was 
easier for the manufacturers to sell and service the larger accounts. And not 
many small businesses could afford the cost of the IBM and NCR systems, which 
made economic sense only if the cost could be spread out among dozens of 
"points of sale," or cash registers. 
</P>
<P>
After Triad declined to take up his idea, Imperiale resigned and started out on 
his own. He soon took on as his partner Alan Grant, a retired San Jose venture 
capitalist living in Coronado and a former national director of the American 
Electronics Assn. Grant helped Imperiale navigate the rough financial waters 
that all start-up companies encounter. 
</P>
<P>
Imperiale's company set out to develop a product geared to retailers with less 
than 10 cash registers per store, and costing half what IBM was charging per 
register. SalePoint's system would also use operating software that permitted 
store managers to use the computers for a variety of purposes. A drawback of 
IBM's proprietary software used in its large-store systems was that it was good 
only for the point-of-sale system, Imperiale said. 
</P>
<P>
The product SalePoint introduced in 1988 was good enough that IBM accepted the 
company as an "industry remarketer" of its products, a tacit admission that 
SalePoint could serve a computer market that Big Blue couldn't, IBM's Beverly 
de Luise said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"IBM depends on its industry remarketers to help us get into niches that IBM 
does not have solutions for," said De Luise, a Raleigh, N.C.-based marketing 
representative who has responsibility for store systems products. "Theme parks 
are a good example. SalePoint has sold IBM hardware into Universal Studios. We 
use them as marketing arms and legs for us." 
</P>
<P>
Despite contractual terms that prohibit SalePoint from selling its software 
with other brands of point-of-sale hardware, Imperiale said his relationship 
with IBM has worked well. The main advantage has been the sales leads that it 
receives from IBM salespeople, who receive the same commissions from a 
SalePoint deal that they would from selling the systems themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The industry term industry remarketer has come to replace value-added reseller, 
or VAR, as a description for a company that buys computer hardware, then adds 
its own software, hardware or technical expertise before reselling the package 
to the end user, Imperiale said. There are an estimated 8,000 such companies in 
the country, according to International Data Corp., a market research firm 
based in Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
SalePoint's five-year, $5-million deal signed last June to supply point-of-sale 
systems to Williams-Sonoma, a San Francisco-based retailer of specialty 
cookware items, was "a real feather in their cap," said Thomas H. Friedman, 
publisher of Retail Systems Alert, a Newton, Mass.-based industry newsletter 
that reports on retail automation trends. 
</P>
<P>
"There are companies that are bigger than SalePoint, wealthier than SalePoint, 
with more technical resources than SalePoint, but there are few companies with 
the tenacity of SalePoint," Friedman said.

SOME CALL HIM BEST TENNIS PLAYER EVER, BUT HE WAS MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is early on an cool and windy fall morning in Pasadena, and tiny La 
Pintoresca park is quiet. The swings are empty. No one is climbing the steps of 
the slide or arriving at the bottom in a whoosh. 
</P>
<P>
La Pintoresca, on the northeast corner of Fair Oaks and Washington, is one of 
the oldest parks in Pasadena. This morning, it's also one of the quietest. 
</P>
<P>
The park's tennis courts, which look as though they have been freshly 
resurfaced, are behind the Omowale Ujama school and only a few blocks south of 
Washington Junior High, where Jackie Robinson went to school. La Pintoresca's 
tennis courts lie silent now, but if they could talk, what a story they could 
tell. 
</P>
<P>
One day, 64 years ago, a 15-year-old boy, destined to become the greatest 
tennis player of his time, walked onto these same courts, carrying a $10 racket 
his mother bought him. A tall, skinny neighborhood kid, he also practiced on 
the public courts at Brookside Park near the Rose Bowl. This is where it all 
began, on these patches of concrete, and one must wonder what secrets he 
discovered there. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly five decades later, British tennis legend Fred Perry could describe 
Ellsworth Vines only as "truly a meteoric flash across the sky of tennis." 
</P>
<P>
But at La Pintoresca park, the only meteoric-looking flashes are swirls of 
graffiti. The park is largely forgotten and the most famous product of its 
tennis courts is mostly forgotten, too. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always that way. Before Pete Sampras of Rancho Palos Verdes came out 
of the Los Angeles area to win the U.S. Open at 19, there was Ellsworth Vines, 
who did the same thing at the same age 59 years earlier. Vines followed his 
1931 U.S. Nationals victory by winning both Wimbledon and the U.S. Nationals 
again in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
Using a powerful serve, a crackling forehand and a volley with more angles than 
a geometry lesson, Vines succeeded Bill Tilden as America's greatest tennis 
player. Don Budge, who succeeded Vines, said he might have been the best of all 
time, anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a believer that things get better in time, but, today, I question whether 
the top player is as good as a Vines," Budge said. "Elly was always an idol of 
mine. He was the best hitter of a tennis ball I've ever seen. He hit the ball 
harder and better and closer to the line than anybody. When he was on, no one 
could beat him." 
</P>
<P>
Vines distanced himself from tournament tennis in 1934. He turned pro, which 
meant he could no longer play any of the Grand Slam events because in those 
days they were for amateurs only. So Vines began touring the world, playing 
exhibitions against such players as Tilden, Budge and Perry. Vines became 
successful, owned the Beverly Hills Tennis Club with Perry, socialized with 
Hollywood's nightclub society, then gave it all up. 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, the gap between Vines and tennis became a chasm. Vines, 28, put down 
his racket and never hit another tennis ball in competition. He would play an 
occasional match for charity, but never to make money for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Vines took up golf, played on the fledgling PGA tour and would have 
earned a name for himself as the first Bo Jackson, if anybody had known about 
Bo Jackson in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Although he never won an event on the pro tour, Vines had 47 top-10 finishes, 
placed second six times and third nine times. Between 1940 and 1957 he played 
in 100 events and finished in the top 20 in 87 of them. He reached the 
semifinals of the 1951 PGA Championship at Oakmont Country Club, when it was 
match play, and lost to Walter Burkemo, who was beaten the next day by Sam 
Snead. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, Vines was gone. He quit the tour, became a teaching pro and 
held full-time jobs at several country clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Vines' athletic career was one of the most schizophrenic in sports history. He 
was successful at amateur tennis and quit it. He was successful at pro tennis 
and quit it. He was successful at pro golf and quit it. But if Vines' career 
was unusual, it was also largely neglected, which is seen by Budge as a 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"All the kids today don't know the name Ellsworth Vines, which is a surprise to 
me," said Budge, 75. "It's amazing to me. Lots of times, I'll say maybe the 
best player I ever saw was Ellsworth Vines, and people will say, 'Who's that?' 
Apparently, he didn't arrest the public." 
</P>
<P>
Of Vines, Jack Kramer, 69, said simply: "He's been forgotten. But all of the 
people who were in the game before the Open era are sort of forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer paused for a moment. Perhaps he was remembering, just for a second, how 
hard Vines could hit a serve. Or how fast Vines sent a forehand cross-court. Or 
the story that after Vines played a clay-court match, they had to put down new 
lines because Vines had erased them with his shots. Or the time the teen-age 
Kramer saw Vines play Tilden in an exhibition on a court constructed on the 
race track at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
At last, Kramer offered one more comment about Vines. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the best." 
</P>
<P>

A CLOSE CALL 
</P>
<P>
Ellsworth Vines, 79, is sitting in the office of his younger brother, Ed, 74, 
on the second floor of the golf clubhouse at La Quinta. Ed Vines is executive 
secretary of the U.S. National Senior Open Assn., which sponsors a series of 
golf tournaments for a group of 1,300 over-50 golfers. It is an organization 
Ellsworth Vines helped build. 
</P>
<P>
The La Quinta clubhouse is about a three-minute drive from Vines' house in a 
gated community with the Santa Rosa Mountains shimmering in the sunlight in the 
background. Inside the house, Vines and his wife, Verle, have arranged a small 
collection of old tennis trophies on two shelves high on the wall. Vines gave 
the rest to a children's hospital. He filled two barrels. 
</P>
<P>
Verle says Vines was never much for hanging onto keepsakes and never kept any 
of his old tennis clothes or rackets. 
</P>
<P>
But Ed Vines has made a rare discovery. Digging around in his office closet, he 
has found a yellowed wooden racket, one formerly used by Ellsworth. Ed Vines 
hands it to his brother, who examines it closely. 
</P>
<P>
"It's warped all right," Ellsworth says. 
</P>
<P>
"But the strings still sing," Ed Vines says. "What is that, a 4 1/2-inch grip?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yep, no more. Gosh, this is from 1934-35, Ed." 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you take it home? As a matter of fact, you should go out and play 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, get some exercise." 
</P>
<P>
They both laugh at this inside joke because Ellsworth Vines is a long way from 
playing tennis these days. In fact, he's just now getting used to hitting a few 
golf balls again. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Vines suffered a heart attack and subsequently had kidney failure. For 
three hours each Monday, Wednesday and Friday, he is hooked up to a dialysis 
machine, whose function is to cleanse the blood, which his kidneys can no 
longer do. 
</P>
<P>
It's not much fun, but Vines is well aware of how close he came to dying. 
</P>
<P>
"I was darn near out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vines checked himself into the hospital because he wasn't feeling well and 
moments later suffered a heart attack. He said he was lucky because his doctor 
was standing only a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"They took me right up to the operating room," Vines said. "What happened, 
there is a vein that goes to the heart and supplies the blood to your heart. 
They cleaned it out. To do that, they use a dye because they wanted to see 
where it was going. In one out of 10 or 15, the dye affects your kidneys. I 
happened to be one of those guys. The dye ruined my kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to die. I had traveled all my life, played in sports and everything 
and I really didn't care anymore. . . . I thought they should have let me go. 
Of course, they don't believe in that. They have to keep you alive if they can. 
</P>
<P>
"I have finally come to grips with it. You just lay there and let the machine 
do your work. Three hours later, it's all over." 
</P>
<P>
Vines walks slowly and occasionally relies on a cane for support. Shelley 
Cooper, a physical therapist and wife of La Quinta tennis pro Jackie Cooper, 
has noticed a marked improvement in Vines' condition after working with him for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, he was weak and down mentally and physically," she said. "I really 
worked on his legs, because they were the weakest part. But he's so much 
better. Now, he's out and about. The idea is to keep his mood and his spirits 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"We go out to the golf course and that's wonderful therapy. He hits 10 balls 
and I hit a million. Everybody stops by to say hello or just to talk to him. 
He's, like, bigger than life, really. He's just a wonderful man. He's so humble 
about all the things he's done. He doesn't really talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE WEAPON 
</P>
<P>
 I've often been asked whether there was any secret to the wrist snap which 
augmented the severity of my serve. . . . Imitate cracking a whip, simulate 
throwing the racket at the ball or act like you're driving a nail with a 
hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Tennis, Myth and Method," by Ellsworth Vines and Gene Vier, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
If there is any present-day player who serves in the manner Vines did, it is 
Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw Sampras serve in the U.S. Open final, I saw myself," Vines said. 
"The same arm action. Same speed. Feet on the ground. Never jumped. Didn't 
grunt. The same way I used to serve, absolutely. I got a great kick out of 
seeing him play." 
</P>
<P>
When Vines hit a serve, it was an act of fury few had seen before. In one 
powerful, swift move, Vines' flat serve jumped off his racket. When Vines aced 
Henry (Bunny) Austin on match point in the 1932 Wimbledon final to complete a 
6-4, 6-2, 6-0 rout, the ball was hit so hard that Austin didn't know on which 
side of him it went. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody ever served better," Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, who never beat Vines as an amateur, said Vines' serve was one of the 
greatest weapons in the history of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the greatest serve I have ever seen anywhere by anybody," Perry said. 
"In one of our pro exhibitions, in 1937, I believe, he had one clocked 118 
m.p.h. from hitting to the landing. Nowadays, they use the radar gun to tell 
you the speed when it leaves the racket. That's preposterous. I don't worry 
about the speed of the ball when it's leaving the racket, only how fast it's 
going after it bounces, when I have to hit it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you this, though," Perry continued. "When you're talking about Elly 
Vines, you're talking about a very special person." 
</P>
<P>
Vines might not have seemed like much of a candidate for success early in his 
life in Pasadena. His father, also named Ellsworth Vines, traveled a lot in the 
advertising business. A sometime tennis player, the elder Vines used to take 
young Ellsworth along with him to the public courts while he played. 
</P>
<P>
But when Vines was 7, his father abandoned the family. Vines eventually began 
going to the courts by himself. If there was an underlying reason for Vines' 
drive to succeed, his father might have provided it by leaving him. 
</P>
<P>
Vines saw his father again about a year before he died. The elder Vines had 
remarried and was living in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so young," Vines said. "Looking back on it after all these years, I 
think I wanted to prove to him that I could play, that I had some worth." 
</P>
<P>
Vines, a natural athlete who was also interested in basketball, soon was good 
enough at tennis to star on the varsity at Pasadena High. In 1928, when he was 
17, Vines won the California high school championships at Los Angeles High. 
This time, his mother didn't have to buy him rackets -- Spalding gave them to 
Vines. 
</P>
<P>
About that time, Vines picked up a coach. His name was Mercer Beasley and he 
had a profound effect on the fledgling tennis star. Beasley, the tennis pro at 
the now-defunct Midwick Country Club in Alhambra, spotted Vines in a junior 
tournament at the club. Beasley was coaching another prodigy, Nelson Dodge, and 
when Vines beat Dodge, Beasley took Vines under his wing. 
</P>
<P>
Beasley refined Vines' game and influenced his all-out style of hitting the 
lines, going for broke, aiming for the corners. To teach accuracy, Beasley 
sometimes hung a canvas over the net with holes the size of a watermelon cut 
out at each side and in the middle. Beasley would tell Vines to hit one down 
the line or cross-court or down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"My job was to try to put it through those holes," Vines said. "See, I had a 
very low trajectory of returning. My problem always from the start was trying 
to get it over the net as low as I could without hitting the tape and dropping 
back. So those holes were probably, I'd say, six inches over the top of the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
"Another thing he used to do before I'd go into a tournament or a match, he 
would go and raise the height of the net about six inches, just pull it up as 
tight as he could," Vines said. "That was helpful. I worked with Beasley about 
four years. He was really my mentor." 
</P>
<P>
By then, Vines' serve was known throughout the junior ranks. Hard and flat, it 
came roaring over the net with little spin. 
</P>
<P>
Vines entered USC on a tennis and basketball scholarship, but he stayed only 
his freshman year. Then, Perry T. Jones, the czar of junior tennis in Southern 
California, persuaded him to concentrate on tennis instead of school. 
</P>
<P>
Jones had the right idea. By 1931, Vines had grown to 6-2 and weighed 160 
pounds. He was the dominant player on the summer tour. He won 13 consecutive 
tournaments, including the National Clay Court Championships in St. Louis. That 
made Vines the top-seeded player in the U.S. Nationals, which evolved into the 
U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals on the grass of Forest Hills, Vines came from two sets behind 
to wear down and defeat Perry, regarded as the best conditioned player in the 
game, 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-3. Perry met Vines earlier that year, when he lost 
to Vines in a five-set final at Newport, R.I. They remain friends, 59 years 
later, and Perry remembers how their relationship began. 
</P>
<P>
"We started out by knocking the hell out of each other," Perry said. "We just 
battled each other to death as amateurs." 
</P>
<P>
Vines lost the first set of the national final to George M. Lott Jr., but came 
back to win his first Grand Slam title, 7-9, 6-3, 9-7, 7-5. With only this one 
major victory behind him, Vines was already being hailed as the next Tilden. 
</P>
<P>
Others were taking notice. In 1931, the United States Tennis Assn. overlooked 
Vines in choosing the Davis Cup team, but there was no way the USTA could leave 
its national champion off the team in 1932. Vines didn't seem too surprised 
that he was excluded the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
"The Davis Cup was strictly social and political here," Vines said. "They 
didn't know a damned thing about tennis. It was a social society and if you 
didn't play or do the way they thought, you just weren't on the team, period, 
no matter how good you played." 
</P>
<P>
Vines was 21 in 1932 when his tennis career reached its zenith. On his first 
trip to England, Vines stunned the tennis world by winning Wimbledon. The All 
England Championships belonged to him after his 42-minute demolition of Austin. 
Next for Vines was the Davis Cup final against France and its famous Musketeers 
-- Jean Borotra, Henri Cochet and Rene Lacoste. 
</P>
<P>
The slow red clay of Roland Garros Stadium wasn't Vines' best surface, which 
quickly became evident when Borotra beat him in the first singles match. France 
was up 2-1 on the final day, needing only a victory over American Wilmer L. 
Alison to wrap it up. Borotra clinched the Davis Cup for France, 3-1, by 
defeating Alison, meaning Vines' final singles match with Cochet was 
meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
But it turned out to be one of the most famous Davis Cup matches of all time. 
Vines played lackadaisically the first two sets and lost them both. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cup had already been decided, you know," Vines said. "So anyway, I lost 
the first two sets and it sure looked as if I'm going down the drain with the 
rest of the team. Then I decided, 'Hell, I'm just going to keep him out here as 
long as I can.' I kept lobbing him and lobbing him. Never hit a hard ball or 
anything. Absolutely against what I do. 
</P>
<P>
"After three or four games of lobbing him, he started to miss overhead smashes. 
I just kept it up and finally he got worse and worse and worse. Then I started 
to play a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
And then? 
</P>
<P>
"And then he was gone." 
</P>
<P>
Vines took the last three sets, handing Cochet his first Davis Cup loss in six 
years. Actually, it was the start of a trend. Vines never lost to Cochet in 12 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to Forest Hills to defend his U.S. National title, Vines was clearly 
at the top of his game. Vines recalls Cochet boasting "he was going to beat 
that little upstart." 
</P>
<P>
Cochet got his chance at revenge in the final, but Vines took him out in 
straight sets, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4, for his second consecutive U.S. championship and 
his third Grand Slam title in 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
And, while the sporting public and publications hailed Vines as the top player 
in the world, promoters were busy trying to persuade him to turn pro and tour. 
</P>
<P>
Vines listened but never got the deal he wanted, so he remained an amateur. And 
if the money wasn't exactly pouring in, the adulation was. Actually, it still 
is. 
</P>
<P>
Says Budge: "Take a composite player. OK, who had the best serve? Vines. The 
best forehand? Vines. The best net game? Vines. Who hit the ball harder than 
anyone? Vines. He had four pluses in his game. You take today's player, they 
are lucky to have one plus." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer: "He had really a great forehand. Who has the best forehand today? 
(Ivan) Lendl? I think Elly's forehand would make Lendl's become average. Great 
control, depth, but Ellsworth could make more placements and make good approach 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Budge and Vines were the best two players of their day, and I don't think I've 
seen anyone who could beat them: Gonzales, Laver, Rosewall, Hoad, Borg, 
Connors, McEnroe, Lendl, Becker, Edberg. I think Vines -- and Budge -- would 
have cleaned up on anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"Just take it from me, if Elly Vines and his game were playing this circuit, he 
would win more money than anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Vines had an off-year in 1933, but at least it was consistent with his style. 
Sometimes the shots went in and sometimes they didn't. More often than not, 
they didn't for Vines, who failed to defend either his U.S. National or 
Wimbledon titles. 
</P>
<P>
At the All England Club, Vines lost to Australian Jack Crawford, 4-6, 11-9, 
6-2, 2-6, 6-4, after blowing several break points in the final set. 
</P>
<P>
"I was off," Vines said. 
</P>
<P>
He was also off at Forest Hills, losing to Bitsy Grant in the fourth round, 
6-3, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"That Bitsy," Vines said. "I beat him every other time. We played on the first 
court next to the clubhouse. He played the same game. He had no speed, nothing, 
but he got everything back. I had to beat him, but I was missing the lines and 
so on and I just couldn't do it. It was probably the worst match I ever played 
in my amateur days. Not very enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
That match summed up the only weakness that Vines had. He always aimed for the 
lines and tried to make the best shot. If he was off only a little bit, Vines 
was in trouble. That was no secret to Vines or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knew I was an in-and-out player," he said. "If I was on, hell, I 
could beat anyone. But if I was off, anyone could beat me." 
</P>
<P>
Budge said Vines never varied his style. 
</P>
<P>
"Elly would have his moments when he would miss the line by a couple of inches, 
and he wouldn't change his game, play safe for a while until he got it back," 
Budge said. "He just kept hitting the ball and if he didn't hit the ball, he 
got dumped by somebody. 
</P>
<P>
"But God help you if he was on his game. There wasn't any safety in his game. 
It was all offense and that was the whole story." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PRO GAME 
</P>
<P>
In 1934, the story changed completely for Vines. He decided to play a series of 
cross-country exhibitions against Tilden. Vines was 22, Tilden 41. 
</P>
<P>
Vines accepted a percentage of the gate each night and collected $52,000 from a 
gross income of $243,000 after matches in 73 cities. He won 47 of the 73 
matches, although Tilden won the first. Before 15,000 in Madison Square Garden 
in New York, Tilden defeated Vines, 8-6, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
For 3 1/2 years, Vines and Tilden crisscrossed the globe, playing an estimated 
125 matches. 
</P>
<P>
In 1938, Vines toured with Perry and in 1939 with Budge. Perry, who won 
Wimbledon three years in succession from 1934-36, turned pro Nov. 6, 1936, in 
New York. He immediately tried to telephone Vines to arrange a tour. Perry 
found Vines in Japan and called him. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember I told him it was Fred," Perry said. "He said 'Are you crazy? It's 
4 a.m.' and I said, 'Do you want to make some money?' And Elly said 'Well, 
that's different.' " 
</P>
<P>
That same year, Vines and Perry became business partners and bought the Beverly 
Hills Tennis Club, which quickly became a haven for such tennis-playing 
Hollywood stars as Gilbert Roland, Paulette Goddard and Charlie Chaplin. Perry 
fondly remembers his business relationship with Vines. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in business together for 20 years and we never had a contract," Perry 
said. "We never had an argument. I would trust Elly with my life." 
</P>
<P>
Vines and Perry, and later Budge, usually played their exhibition matches on 
canvas stretched over a portable wooden court. After each match, the court 
would be broken down and hauled out to a truck for the trip to the next city. 
</P>
<P>
Vines played one match against Tilden in Asbury Park, N.J., when the canvas 
court was stretched over a marble dance floor. The court was so fast and the 
ball bounced so low, Vines remembers, that he played about 20 feet behind the 
baseline. 
</P>
<P>
Vines endorsed Wilson rackets and tennis balls for a fee. He provided his own 
clothes and Spalding gave him shoes, which was good advertising for them. 
Vines' only other endorsement was the $1,000 he received from Camel cigarettes, 
even though he didn't smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Perry said he beat Vines in one exhibition they played in El Paso after Perry 
persuaded workmen to move the service line in about six inches without Vines' 
knowledge. "He served about 10,000 double faults and I won, 6-0, 6-1, in 20 
minutes," Perry said. "In 1977, he came to the house for dinner and I 
confessed. Elly said 'Dammit, Perry, I knew there was something wrong with my 
serve.' He was right. It just took me 40 years to tell him." 
</P>
<P>
For five years, from 1934-38, Vines reigned as the top professional in the 
world, a field that included, besides Tilden and Perry, Cochet, Lott, Vinnie 
Richards, Hans Nusslein, Mark Kozeluh, Bruce Barnes, Dan Maskell, Dick Skeen 
and Lester Stofen. Budge came along at the end of 1938, the same year he won 
the Grand Slam, and began a pro series with Vines. 
</P>
<P>
It must have been strange for both players: Tilden's successor meeting his own. 
Vines easily won the series, 37-22, but he was bothered by a pulled stomach 
muscle and won only five of the last 20 matches. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I could beat Budge, and I think I would have," Vines said. "I had to 
serve side-armed and he was just knocking the ball down my throat." 
</P>
<P>
Then, in January of 1940, in New York City, playing Tilden in a benefit for 
Finnish relief, Vines put down his racket for good. He had already been 
tinkering with golf, and even Budge knew it was becoming more and more 
important to Vines. 
</P>
<P>
"He was crazy about golf," Budge said. "He told me would play pro tennis until 
somebody beat him. Then he would play golf. I knew he wanted to beat me because 
I lost an awful lot of weight chasing his shots down." 
</P>
<P>
Vines insists he was not chased out of tennis because of Budge's rise to power. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had no desire to play tennis anymore," he said. "But I had the idea I 
could be a pretty good golfer. And I did get pretty good at it. I got a great 
kick out of beating guys at their own game." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer said Vines left tennis at least partly because of Budge. 
</P>
<P>
"When Budge came along and turned professional, Elly had lost his desire," 
Kramer said. "He didn't think tennis was going anywhere, so he turned to golf. 
He had been playing it for some time anyway. He just didn't have his heart and 
soul in tennis anymore." 
</P>
<P>
So at 29, Vines began a new career. Although he never won a major golf 
championship, he finished No. 11 on the PGA money list in 1947, earning 
$10,391, well behind Jimmy Demaret's leading $24,500. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Barber, 74, who still plays on the Senior PGA Tour, remembers that Vines 
turned himself into a good player and was respected by his golfing peers. 
</P>
<P>
"He had one little problem," Barber said. "He shanked the ball. He hit the ball 
pretty long. He was one good all-around player. If he had started a little 
sooner, I definitely think he would have won his share of tournaments. When he 
should have been hitting golf balls, he was hitting tennis balls instead." 
</P>
<P>
Vines' one shot at winning a major golf tournament was at the 1951 PGA at 
Oakmont, near Pittsburgh. Vines led Burkemo in match play by two holes with two 
to play in the semifinals, but Burkemo caught up with a birdie on No. 17 and 
par on No. 18, coming out of the rough on both holes. When Burkemo birdied the 
extra hole, Vines was just the way he described Cochet in the 1932 Davis Cup -- 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
Vines and Verle adopted two children and Vines wanted to spend more time with 
his family, so he dropped off the pro golf tour. He was golf pro at Midwick 
Country Club, back where he had begun his amateur tennis career. He also worked 
at the Denver Country Club, Wilshire Country Club and Tamarisk in Rancho 
Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Vines picked up some notable golf partners. He played with 
President Eisenhower at Eldorado in Indian Wells and remembers Eisenhower 
stacking the foursomes so he could win. Vines said Eisenhower preferred to be 
called General, not Mr. President. 
</P>
<P>
Another regular was Bing Crosby, with whom Vines played at Lakewood Country 
Club in Toluca Lake. 
</P>
<P>
"But he wasn't much fun to play with," Vines said. "Well, if you won $5 from 
him, he always wanted to go out and play a whiskey round until he got even. You 
know, he never wanted to pay off. We never played for much anyway, but he was 
real chintzy that way." 
</P>
<P>
Vines does not like to look back and second-guess his golf career. He had a 
family, after all, and he considered it important that the father stay home, as 
his own father had not been able to do. 
</P>
<P>
But, still . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I think if I had kept on playing another year or two, I would have been pretty 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE GOLDEN YEARS 
</P>
<P>
The quietest room in Vines' house is the den. Two recliners face a TV set on 
one wall, a window wall behind them. On the two other walls are black and white 
pictures: Vines with Tilden. Vines with Perry. Vines with Kramer. Vines with 
Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Vines with Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
The only color photograph in the room is an aerial shot of No. 18 at Pebble 
Beach. There is also a needlepoint pillow in the room with lettering that says: 
"Screw the Golden Years." 
</P>
<P>
It is only about a three-hour drive from La Pintoresca, but it seems so much 
farther away. Not long ago, Perry came to visit his longtime friend. 
</P>
<P>
"We were miles apart in younger life, but we hit it off together as friends," 
Perry said. "That's all you've got when you get older. You keep your friends 
and the things you did together." 
</P>
<P>
What Vines did is legendary, even if memory of it is dulled by the years that 
have passed since players wore flannel, tennis balls were white and rackets 
were wooden. 
</P>
<P>
"I never sought notoriety," Vines said. "I mean, it was nice to walk into a 
place and they would say, 'Oh, yeah, you're Elly Vines, here's a nice table for 
you,' or something like that. But I never threw any weight around or anything. 
I was always at the back of the bus. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I never sought fame. It just came with my tennis victories, you know. I 
was never enamored by it at all. Actually, I didn't really give a damn."

<P>
One week after a 10-point, 16-punt game was hailed by some as the greatest game 
in Monday night memory, the Raiders and Detroit Lions redefined the terms at 
the Silverdome, running and shooting their way into households with an 
offensive display that can best be described in degrees of bedlam and havoc. 
</P>
<P>
It was Barry and Bo and a whole lot more, but in the end, it was the Raiders 
who barely escaped a Mouse Davis trap and fled the scene with a 38-31 victory 
over the Lions before 72,190. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders said all along that they didn't like the run-and-shoot offense. Now 
you know why. The Lions scored on their first five possessions and threatened 
to run away with the game as fast as Barry Sanders could fly, but enough 
dignity was restored in the second half to cool Detroit's wheels and get out of 
town at 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
The teams needed cooling after the first quarter, during which the Raiders and 
Lions combined for 35 points -- the second-highest total in NFL history. They 
surpassed the final point total to last week's "classic" between the New York 
Giants and San Francisco 49ers with 12:25 left . . . in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought there were going to be 100 points scored," Raider Coach Art Shell 
said later. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Raiders made some adjustments to control the Sanders-and-shoot in the 
second half. Sanders had 122 yards in 16 carries in two quarters. The Lions 
were leading, 24-21. Who wouldn't adjust? 
</P>
<P>
But the Raiders proved the best defense against the Lions is a conventional, 
time-consuming offense. The Raiders open the second half with a 67-yard drive 
that took 6:40. They took the lead for good with 8:11 left in the quarter on a 
10-yard scoring pass from Jay Schroeder to Mervyn Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, the Raiders added rookie linebacker Aaron Wallace to a defensive 
mix that had not been mixing up the Lions previously. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half, they mainly played with two linebackers, and played more 
with six defensive backs," Detroit quarterback Rodney Peete said. "They changed 
it up." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace sacked Peete on second down. Linebacker Jerry Robinson sacked Peete on 
third down. 
</P>
<P>
On their next drive, the Raiders moved patiently again from the Detroit 49. 
Schroeder found Willie Gault for 18 yards on third and 13. From the 31, Bo 
Jackson raced 21 yards around the right side to the 10. On third and goal at 
the three, Schroeder threw left for Tim Brown, who made a spinning, one-handed 
catch for touchdown to put the Raiders ahead, 35-24, with 1:51 to play in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders took a deep breath, but the Lions snatched it back from them. 
Things were going well until Schroeder's pass was intercepted by Victor Jones 
near midfield with 12:34 left. Sanders broke loose for runs of 13, 12, seven, 
and five yards. Before you knew it, Peete had scrambled six yards for a 
touchdown with 8:36 left. The Raider lead was cut to four. 
</P>
<P>
But the Raiders couldn't launch another drive. Marcus Allen gained 12 yards on 
a third-down reception. He needed 13. The Raiders punted it back. The crowd 
began chanting, "Barry, Barry," before Sanders stuck his head in the huddle 
with his team at the 39 and 6:08 remaining. An eternity. 
</P>
<P>
But soon first and 10 became third and 10, and Peete scrambled upfield and 
seemed a cinch for the first down -- until cornerback Garry Lewis crushed him 
two yards short with a great open-field tackle. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions sent on their punt team. The crowd booed. Lion Coach Wayne Fontes 
sized up his future and called time out. The Lions changed their minds and sent 
the offense back in. Fourth and two at their 47, with 4:30 left. 
</P>
<P>
"If we punted, and got the ball back, we'd still need a touchdown," Fontes 
explained. "We needed a TD. A field goal can't win. I'd make the call again." 
</P>
<P>
Peete, the former USC star, broke across midfield on a scramble for an apparent 
first down, but defensive end Greg Townsend stripped the ball from behind. It 
bounded backward in a chaotic scene that saw tackle Harvey Salem try to swipe 
at the ball while flat on his back. It wasn't a first down anymore. The Raiders 
had survived. From the Detroit 39, they drove deep enough to escape with the 
cushion of a 37-yard field goal by Jeff Jaeger. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, there was no life left in the run-and-shoot. The Lions took over 
at their 20 with 1:49 to play needing a touchdown to tie, but never escaped the 
shadow of their goal posts. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions dropped to 4-9 with the loss. But no one was calling them boring 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
In the battle of the backs, Sanders finished with 176 yards in 25 carries, but 
was held to 54 after intermission. Jackson finished with 129 yards in 18 
carries and appears to be pushing Allen out of the Raider backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Allen started the game, but Jackson took the first run from scrimmage, not 
Allen. Allen finished with 18 yards in seven carries. Shell abandoned his usual 
tailback rotation. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have a feeling," Shell said. "Give me Bo here, give me Marcus there. A 
lot of people think I have a master plan for this, but I don't. I just go with 
the hot guy." 
</P>
<P>
The second half was a snooze compared to the first. 
</P>
<P>
It was this kind of half: 
</P>
<P>
The Lions didn't punt until the two-minute warning. They needed six plays to 
score their first two touchdowns, on Sanders' runs of 35 and five yards. The 
Raiders needed a fish net to control Sanders. Mel Gray's first two kickoffs 
returns for Detroit went for 49 and 41 yards, both leading to touchdowns. On 
kickoff No. 3, the Raiders booted the ball out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Back and forth it went. The Lions needed two minutes to go ahead, 7-0. The 
Raiders needed 15 seconds to tie it. On their first play from scrimmage, Jay 
Schroeder completed a 68-yard scoring pass play to Gault. Gault made the catch 
and skidded to the ground because of forward momentum. It appeared safety 
Bennie Blades had made contact with Gault at the 18, but Gault didn't think so. 
He got up off the rug and ran in for a touchdown. After an instant replay 
review, the play stood. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions needed two plays to score again, with Peete setting up Sanders' run 
with a 51-yard strike to Jeff Campbell to the Raider five. 
</P>
<P>
What was wrong with this picture? The Lions led, 14-7, before Jackson touched 
the ball. No one upstages Bo. He finished the half with 73 yards in six carries 
and cut the lead to 24-21 on a 55-yard dash run around left end. 
</P>
<P>
Mistakes? They made a few. In the first quarter, Raider corner Terry McDaniel 
intercepted a pass from Peete and returned it 15 yards to the Detroit six. Two 
plays later, Allen scored on a two-yard run to make it 14-14. Peete had a 
seven-yard scoring pass of his own in the half. Kicker Eddie Murray had a 
47-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The half was a game in itself. It even included two touchdowns that were 
reviewed by instant replay and upheld after the usual delays and further 
reviews. The passes kept coming, the whistles kept blowing. Sanders kept 
running, the Raiders kept missing. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, it was three yards and a cloud of dust. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders activated tight end Rich Bartlewski from their practice squad for 
Monday night's game, releasing receiver Keith McDonald. . . . Quarterback Steve 
Beuerlein and tackle James FitzPatrick were not activated for the game. . . . 
With his 11-yard reception in the first quarter, Marcus Allen became the first 
running back in AFC history to record 400 catches. Five NFC backs have 
accomplished the feat. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Schroeder's 68-yard scoring pass play to Willie Gault in the first quarter 
was his first since Oct. 21, covering a span of 20 quarters. . . . With a 
22-yard run in the second quarter, Barry Sanders surpassed 1,000 yards rushing 
for the season. . . . Schroeder completed 12 of 19 passes for 195 yards. He 
threw for three touchdowns and had two passes intercepted.

PHAR LAP'S LEGEND LIVES ON IN AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SYDNEY, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this year, I was showing an Australian visitor the main attractions of 
Washington, D.C., and took him, of course, to the Lincoln Memorial. I said that 
Lincoln was the most universally revered figure in our nation's history, and 
asked him who would have a comparable stature in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The visitor didn't hesitate: "Phar Lap." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there do seem to be more monuments in Australia to the legendary 
racehorse of the 1930s than to any of the country's founders. His statue graces 
the entrance to Flemington Race Course, site of the Melbourne Cup. The original 
Phar Lap was stuffed by a taxidermist and is on display at a museum in 
Melbourne, where it is a major tourist attraction. His heart has been preserved 
under glass at the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra. (Naturally, 
it's a gigantic heart.) 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the death of the champion -- after an ill-fated trip to North America 
-- still is a nettlesome issue here. On my first day in this country, the taxi 
driver from the airport recognized my accent and talked at length about how 
Aussies love Americans, how they've never forgotten that we were allies in 
World War II, but added one small proviso: "We'll never forgive you for killing 
Phar Lap." 
</P>
<P>
No great racehorse has ever had a career so melodramatic. Phar Lap was bred in 
New Zealand and entered in a yearling sale there. A scuffling Australian 
trainer, Harry Telford, loved his pedigree, and persuaded an owner named David 
J. Davis to make the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
When Phap Lap arrived from New Zealand after a rough crossing of the Tasman 
Sea, skin had been torn off his head and he limped out of the tight quarters he 
had occupied on ship. Davis didn't want him, and so he leased him to Telford 
for three years -- an agreement that would prove to be fateful. 
</P>
<P>
Phar Lap -- the name means "lightning" in Sinhalese, the major language of Sri 
Lanka -- was slow to bloom, but he won his last nine races as a 3-year-old and 
was a popular champion by the time he was 4 and was preparing for the Melbourne 
Cup. Bookmakers stood to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars if he won. 
</P>
<P>
His groom, Tommy Woodcock, recalled the events of that week in a film interview 
made shortly before his death a few years ago: "Mr. Telford got several letters 
that they were going to shoot him or run him down in the road. One morning we 
were going from the racetrack back to the stable and I happened to see this car 
on the road. The car started, and I took Phar Lap to the corner and pushed him 
to the fence. The car comes whizzing around the corner and all of a sudden a 
gun comes out the back window and fires a couple shots. They missed by a couple 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
After that close call, Phap Lap went into hiding before the Cup and arrived at 
Flemington under police escort 40 minutes before post time. The crowd roared at 
his arrival, and roared even louder after he carried 138 pounds to victory in 
the two-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being burdened by crushing weights, Phar Lap won 15 of 17 races as a 
4-year-old. As a 5-year-old, he won nine of 10. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Telford's three-year lease had expired, Davis was in charge and he 
chose to accept an invitation the trainer wanted to decline: to run in a stakes 
race at the Agua Caliente track in Tijuana, Mexico, just south of San Diego, 
for the then-incredible purse of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Woodcock went with him on the ghastly ocean trip, but Phar Lap weathered it 
well enough that he was able to win the Caliente Handicap in track-record time, 
beating some of the best horses in North America. Now he was an international 
hero -- American newspapers hailed him as the "Red Terror from the Antipodes" 
-- and Davis was planning on running him in the United States, then in England. 
</P>
<P>
Phar Lap, of course, never got that chance. Woodcock was looking after him in 
Menlo Park, Calif., where, he said: "Early one morning he got a little sick -- 
just a little temperature -- but by the next day he was in terrible pain. It 
was pitiful really, all the squealing and the pain he was in. I led him into 
the box (his stall) and he let out one unmerciful squeal and died in my arms." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, flags in Australia were flying at half-mast, and headlines in 
newspapers said simply: "HE'S DEAD." 
</P>
<P>
Who or what killed Phar Lap? After the earlier attempts on his life, 
Australians were naturally conspiracy-minded, and a Melbourne reporter who 
accompanied him on his North American trip reported he was killed by poisoned 
balls of clay that were thrown through the window of his stall. 
</P>
<P>
The truth probably was much less dramatic. Isobel Carter, Phar Lap's principal 
biographer, researched the whole issue in depth and concluded that the horse 
had eaten "highly fermentable green pasture" that caused his stomach to swell 
and brought on a fatal attack of colic. 
</P>
<P>
The mysterious circumstances only added to the Phar Lap legend. 
</P>
<P>
"He came along in the Depression years and he was a symbol of hope and 
optimism," said Gary Gray, who conducted the Tommy Woodcock interview and has 
produced films on Australian racing history here. "He also told the world that 
we could produce horses to beat the best, and we could do a whole lot of other 
things too. We were not just a colony. Phar Lap was a symbol of our emergence 
as a nation."

DETROIT: SANDERS IMPRESSES JACKSON AND A SPECTATOR NAMED DICKERSON.

Raider running back Bo Jackson has a new hero. 
</P>
<P>
"Barry Sanders is my new idol," Jackson said. "I love the way the guy runs. 
When I grow up, I want to be just like him." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sanders outran Jackson in the battle of former Heisman winners Monday 
night, the Raiders neutralized Sanders in the second half and rallied for a 
38-31 victory at the Silverdome. 
</P>
<P>
With Eric Dickerson, the NFL's best running back of the 1980s, watching from 
the sidelines, Sanders and Jackson, who perhaps will be the best runners of the 
1990s, ran wild. 
</P>
<P>
"They were great tonight," Dickerson said of Sanders and Jackson. "Me being a 
running back, I like to watch other running backs play. It was quite a show for 
both players." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson said Sanders' quickness helps him elude defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"He's quick and he's very, very strong," Dickerson said. "That's what makes him 
great." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to assess Jackson, Dickerson said: "He doesn't move laterally as well as 
Barry does, but he has great moves and that's what makes him great. They're 
different type runners, but they're both great runners." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders rushed for a season-high 176 yards in 25 carries, only eight yards shy 
of his career high, and scored two touchdowns on runs of 35 and five yards. 
</P>
<P>
Despite sharing time with Marcus Allen, Jackson rushed for 129 yards in 18 
carries, including a 55-yard touchdown run. Jackson had 113 yards in 13 carries 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the four Heisman winners in the game (Tim Brown, Allen, Sanders and 
Jackson) we all scored, but Barry had to go and show off because he scored 
twice," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and Sanders talked as they walked off the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told him he's like a little water bug out there," Jackson said. "I told 
him to keep his head up because good things are going to happen down the road 
to him and the Lions. They're the best 4-9 team we've faced." 
</P>
<P>
A fan hung a banner from the Silverdome railing that read: "Barry Rules." 
</P>
<P>
The assessment was correct as Sanders rushed for 122 yards and two touchdowns 
in the first half to stake the Lions to a 24-21 lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders had an edge against the Raider defense, which employed only three down 
linemen on first down. Running against a defense that included three linemen, 
two linebackers and six defensive backs, Sanders put the run in the Lions' 
run-and-shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see Barry Sanders in a Rams' type of offense," Raider defensive 
end Howie Long said. "The guy might rewrite every NFL record if he stays 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not tough to bring down if you hit him. But he's hard to get a hit on. 
The only time you're really going to get a clean hit on him is from behind or 
from the side when he's (faking) two or three guys out." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, the NFL's leading rusher with 905 yards entering the game, gained 22 
yards on a delay with four minutes left in the second quarter. Sanders had 
compiled 1,027 yards this season by the end of the first half. He had 1,081 
yards by the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders credited his offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
"We just blocked well," Sanders said. "We were really geared up for the game 
and our guys created a lot of holes and that was probably the underlying factor 
in my success." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders outran safety Eddie Anderson on a 35-yard touchdown run on his second 
carry of the game. Although Anderson had a chance to tackle Sanders at the 18, 
Sanders spun around Anderson and raced into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"I had him, but Terry (McDaniel) came over and knocked me off him," Anderson 
said. "He's a great back, but I think I would have gotten him if Terry hadn't 
knocked me off him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Sanders is one of the best I've faced. He's powerful and cuts so fast 
that he's hard to catch." 
</P>
<P>
What adjustments did the Raiders make to stop Sanders in the second half? 
</P>
<P>
"We settled down and understood what they were trying to do," Raider Coach Art 
Shell said. "We started closing lanes down to keep him from hitting the cracks. 
We just did a better job in the second half."

The NCAA has accepted Maryland's self-imposed penalties for basketball Coach 
Gary Williams and some staff members watching a preseason pickup game last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The penalties were also for issuing practice gear during the summer of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland reprimanded those involved in the NCAA violations and postponed 
preseason practice by five days to Oct. 20., according to the university. 
</P>
<P>
The letter from NCAA Assistant Director of Enforcement David Berst stated, "The 
committee (NCAA Committee on Infractions) has accepted the university's actions 
as appropriate in this matter and concluded that no additional penalty should 
be imposed by the committee."

Steroid use among college athletes is higher than previously estimated, perhaps 
as high as 29% among football players, according to researchers who asked 
universities to estimate use among opponents. 
</P>
<P>
A professor in Penn State's college of health and human development said that 
his study sets an "upper limit" of actual anabolic steroid use among college 
athletes, whereas an NCAA study done last year set the lower limit. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Yesalis said that an average of 14.7% of the males and 5.9% of the 
female athletes in all sports surveyed reported steroid use. A 1989 NCAA study 
based on self-reporting estimated steroid use at less than 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The study projected steroid use at 29.3% for football teams, and 20.6% among 
men's track and field teams.

PAUL BROWN IN HOSPITAL WITH BLOOD CLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cincinnati Bengal founder Paul Brown is recoverying from a blood clot in his 
leg that forced him to be hospitalized during the weekend, according to the 
team's doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Heidt Jr. said the problem wasn't serious, and Brown should be able 
to go home today. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 82, was in Christ Hospital when his team lost to the San Francisco 
49ers, 20-17, in overtime Sunday. It was the first time Brown had missed one of 
the Bengals' home games. 
</P>
<P>
Winless in his first four games as the Cleveland Browns' head coach, Jim 
Shofner has given up any hope of returning to the same job next season. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I wasn't the answer," Shofner said Monday. "Certainly I inherited a 
lot of circumstances. You can say there are all these reasons why, and maybe 
they're legitimate. But it still adds up to the same thing -- I didn't get it 
done." 
</P>
<P>
The Browns lost to Houston, 58-14, Sunday, giving up more points than they had 
ever given up in a regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Bear Coach Mike Ditka got into a heated exchange with a reporter 
Monday, broke off his weekly news conference and stomped out of the room. 
</P>
<P>
The outburst was triggered when Red Mottlow of Chicago's WFYR radio asked Ditka 
about the Bears' offensive showing in Sunday's 10-9 loss to the Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong?" Mottlow asked. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka replied: "They got a pretty good defense, Red, and they stopped us! Why 
don't you talk about how good they played instead of our problems." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka then swore and told Mottlow, "You're a joke." 
</P>
<P>
After somebody else asked a question, Ditka said, "You want to get answers to 
what you need, get them from Red Mottlow. He's the expert on everything."

LOTT LEADS HIT PARADE, MAKING 200 POUNDS FEEL LIKE A TON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As New York lost to San Francisco last week, the play that symbolized three 
combative hours in Candlestick Park was probably the hit of the year. 
</P>
<P>
It was the hit that Giant tight end Mark Bavaro absorbed from 49er free safety 
Ronnie Lott. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't save the game, a low-scoring affair that ended 7-3. The save came 
later -- when Lott made his other big play of a defensive night, a diving, 
one-handed deflection in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
But it did raise a good question: How can this guy hit football players 
seemingly harder than anyone else does? 
</P>
<P>
He isn't the biggest 49er. Standing an even 6 feet, Lott, a former USC 
All-American, weighs an even 200 pounds. He is a lightweight next to the man he 
clobbered. 
</P>
<P>
A six-year NFL veteran from Notre Dame, Bavaro goes 6-4 and 245. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Lott, timing the hit perfectly, knocked him groggy. 
</P>
<P>
Lott's key is that he is a student of the mechanics of hitting. Muhammad Ali 
would be proud of him. So would any clean liver. 
</P>
<P>
Lott never goes for the knees. And unlike football's other heavy hitters, he 
doesn't attack shoulder-first. 
</P>
<P>
He is a body-to-body hitter. In a classic NFL moment, Giant quarterback Phil 
Simms, hurried by the 49er pass rush, had overthrown the target -- forcing 
Bavaro to stretch far out for the ball -- when Lott smashed him with the entire 
front of his body from the forehead down. 
</P>
<P>
It was an exotic piece of offensive defense. 
</P>
<P>
One unusual thing about pro football is that it seems to attract a good many 
casual fans. 
</P>
<P>
The TV crowd for any big NFL game obviously includes many thousands of passive, 
indifferent, or slightly interested fans -- those who doubt that football is a 
particularly great sport, though they will watch it, idly, on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
That is the only way to explain the audience-survey numbers. 
</P>
<P>
For the Giant-49er game last week, the Nielsen rating was 27. By comparison, 
the World Series last fall averaged 20.8. The NBA finals last spring averaged 
12.4. 
</P>
<P>
The strange truth is that the Neilsen rating for the Super Bowl's pregame show 
is larger than the numbers for championship games in other sports. 
</P>
<P>
In college basketball last spring, the title game hit 20. 
</P>
<P>
Leading into the Super Bowl last winter, the pregame show hit 21.6. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that many football spectators -- specifically, many of those who 
watched the 49ers and Giants last week -- are comparatively undiscerning fans. 
</P>
<P>
They are basketball fans or rock fans or, possibly, fast-car fans who, for a 
night, were drawn to an NFL event because it seemed to be the nation's biggest 
sports event since the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And that accounts for the dichotomy of the national reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Most football fans called it a good defensive game. 
</P>
<P>
Most casual fans called it boring. 
</P>
<P>
Casual fans criticized the 49er defensive team because it never sacked Simms. 
</P>
<P>
Football fans realized that Lott's big hit, for example, was set up by the 49er 
rush on Simms. They realized that for better or worse, football is offense and 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
In one of linebacker Lawrence Taylor's big years, the Giant defense will get 
another chance against another brilliant offensive team Saturday when 
quarterback Jim Kelly arrives at the Meadowlands with the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo and New York are each 11-2, a tick behind the 49ers. And as the AFC's 
only 11-2 club, the Bills, in the opinion of many, are Super Bowl-bound. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants and other NFC clubs have won six consecutive Super Bowl games and 
eight of the last nine. Do the Bills really want to get there? 
</P>
<P>
Won't the AFC's 1990 champion become its seventh consecutive Super Bowl 
casualty? 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't the NFC that's been beating the AFC," Buffalo General Manager Bill 
Polian said. "As the regular-season results have told us for years, the 
conferences are about even. 
</P>
<P>
"What's important to understand is that the Super Bowl is a game of matchups. 
And it just happens that most of the teams that won AFC championships in the 
1980s didn't match up well with NFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, the 49ers were a super Super Bowl team in the '80s. They've won four 
of the last nine. They'd have beaten anybody. The reason they win so often is 
that their big-play guys are more consistent than anyone else's." 
</P>
<P>
How would the Bills match up with the 49ers or Giants in Super Bowl XXV? 
</P>
<P>
"We have the defense and the quarterback," Polian said. "Defense gets you into 
the playoffs, and quarterbacking takes you the rest of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Of the AFC champions of recent years, only the Cincinnati Bengals have made a 
game of it against the NFC, losing Super Bowl XXIII to the 49ers in the last 
minute, 20-16. 
</P>
<P>
In a rematch Sunday, the 49ers caught the Bengals again, 20-17, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"Cincinnati is the only AFC team that has matched up well with an (NFC 
champion) lately," the Buffalo executive said. "As you saw again (Sunday), they 
have what it takes to battle Montana all the way -- a big offensive line, good 
play-action passing, an active defense and speed in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
"Denver is an example of a team that could win AFC (titles) but didn't match up 
with NFC (champion). They're agile and well conditioned, but built to excel in 
Denver's rarefied air, and sometimes they've been too small." 
</P>
<P>
Will Buffalo beat the Giants Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
"Our quarterback can do more things on his own than their quarterback," Polian 
said. "But everything depends on how we handle their power." 
</P>
<P>
Quote Department:

Bernie Kosar, Cleveland quarterback commenting on one aspect of the Browns' 
slump: "(Coach) Jim Shofner is the fifth play-caller I've had in six years."

(Night Train) Lane, as quoted by Rick Korch in Pro Football Weekly: "Night 
Train was the best defensive back to ever play the game. I tried to pattern my 
game after him. I've never seen a defensive back hit the way he hit -- I mean, 
take them down, whether it be Jim Taylor or Jim Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Doleman, Minnesota defensive lineman: "I don't like these bye weeks. I 
like getting right back in there and playing."

MEN ACCUSED OF BEATING PHILLIPS ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL FOR ASSAULT

<P>
Three men accused of severely beating San Diego Charger nose tackle Joe 
Phillips were ordered Monday to stand trial in Superior Court on assault 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge E. Mac Amos Jr. bound the three men over for trial after 
a 2 1/2-hour preliminary hearing in which two eyewitnesses placed at least one 
of the defendants at the site of the beating. 
</P>
<P>
Charged in the attack are Scott Stewart, 24, of Santee; David Hanna, 22, of San 
Diego; and Brett Dost, 21, of San Diego. All three men are currently free on 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
The three men will be arraigned in Superior Court on Dec. 27 on charges of 
assault with a deadly weapon, battery with serious bodily injury and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, 27, suffered severe head injuries when he was attacked on Sept. 26 
after leaving Saska's, a Mission Beach restaurant, with a female companion. 
</P>
<P>
The 315-pound nose tackle underwent surgery for some of the injuries, which 
will probably cause him to miss the rest of the Chargers' season.

VINES: TODAY'S STARS CAN'T COMPARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How would Boris Becker, Ivan Lendl, Stefan Edberg and the rest of today's 
players stack up against their predecessors as stars in men's tennis? 
</P>
<P>
Not very well, if the matches were played under the old conditions, Ellsworth 
Vines said. 
</P>
<P>
Today's players have a real edge, not only in equipment, where composition 
rackets hold an obvious advantage over wooden ones, but also in the serve, 
Vines said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an entirely new ballgame now," Vines said. "First off, there is no 
foot-fault rule, or at least they don't call it. They can jump off the ground. 
They can toss the ball inside the court and follow it in. They've got a whole 
step on us at least. 
</P>
<P>
"And the equipment now is much better," he said. "I would think if they were 
playing under the same rules and conditions under which we were playing, we 
could beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Here are Vines' choices as the top five men's tennis players of all time and 
his comments about them: 
</P>
<P>
1. Bill Tilden -- He was just the best. He could play all the shots. He moved 
well, he won just about everything and was way ahead of his time. 
</P>
<P>
2. Fred Perry -- The thing I remember most about his game is that he was very 
quick on the court . . . very fast. He covered the court just so well. He 
didn't have tremendous speed on his shots, didn't hit them real hard, but he 
got them all back. He also had a marvelous forehand drive. 
</P>
<P>
3. Don Budge -- He had an all-court game and a marvelous backhand, which was 
his bread and butter. He could do most anything with it, (but) most of the 
time, he hit it down the line. He also had a real will to win. 
</P>
<P>
4. Jack Crawford -- He could play on any court. You couldn't get a shot past 
him. He didn't have any particular overpowering weapon, but he could hit from 
either side and hit winners. He was underrated for what he could really do. 
</P>
<P>
5. Jack Kramer -- He could beat any of these younger players. He had a fine 
serve and was an excellent net player. His best shot was a forehand drive to 
the backhand. That gave the other fellows problems, and how!

SOUTH COAST REP'S SCROOGE IS MORE GENEROUS THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Ebenezer Scrooge plunges headlong with the rest of us into an apparently 
nasty decade filled with omens of war and hard times, his redemption through 
generosity and kindness would seem to have a special significance. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, Hal Landon Jr. has turned serious as Charles Dickens' 
notorious miser. 
</P>
<P>
He brings a far more provocative dimension to his perennial starring role in 
South Coast Repertory's adaptation of "A Christmas Carol" than the caricature 
depicted last year. 
</P>
<P>
Landon remakes Scrooge into a tragic figure of sorts, eliminating last year's 
giddy baby talk in a climactic second-act scene that trivialized the meaning of 
the play. But his deepened performance is not matched by the company. 
</P>
<P>
The romantic by-play between young Ebenezer and Belle -- one of last year's 
more appealing digressions -- is totally lost. Richard Soto is wooden as young 
Ebenezer. Lucy Rodriguez not only lacks delicacy as Belle, but manages the 
seemingly impossible feat of swallowing her words while delivering them with 
stentorian flourish. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Doyle brings the requisite joviality to the role of Fezziwig and gives 
us a bawdy, less feral portrait of the Faganesque Joe. 
</P>
<P>
The party scenes have lost some radiance, though John-David Keller's staging is 
lively and Dwight Richard Odle's costumes colorfully authentic. The technical 
pizazz is there, including special effects that elicit audience shrieks.

DEATH AND TIME -- THE UNINVITED GUESTS TO 'DINNER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Theatre Ensemble's third annual production of "The Long Christmas 
Dinner," Thornton Wilder's extraordinary memory play, sweeps aside the usual 
batch of gooey holiday theater sentiments with profound simplicity. Dinner is 
spread out for us in the ensemble's tiny second space in Venice, bedecked with 
a few quilts, a china cabinet, a dinner table and seven intelligent actors. 
</P>
<P>
As we enter, we're treated to carols, fresh cookies, hot cider in real mugs, 
and then Frank Sullivan's magical story, "Crisp New Bills for Mr. Teagle," 
charmingly read by Randy Oglesby. 
</P>
<P>
Just when we're cozying down to another Yuletide show, Wilder's tale of three 
generations of the Bayard family blows in like a cold blast from the north. 
Moments of stage time can cover years in this increasingly wealthy but decaying 
family, with the Christmas dinner as a firm marker of time. The old folks die 
away, and so do children -- one in swaddling clothes, one in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Wilder of "Our Town," whose sense of death's and time's effect on 
American innocence continues to evoke powerful emotional quakes. Director Steve 
Markus' ensemble (Oglesby, Sarah Zinsser, Melissa Weber, Mick Regan, Loren 
Lester, Martha Hackett, and Stephanie Shroyer) plumb this landscape with 
exquisite unity.

</P>
<P>
No Tiny Tim, no warm Christmas fires. 
</P>
<P>
This perennial one-man reading of "A Christmas Carol" is furnished strictly by 
the vigor of Charles Dickens' words, the distinctive characterizations 
delivered by Stewart's reading of them -- and by the tricks they play on our 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who is a Royal Shakespeare Company stalwart (now known to larger 
audiences as Captain Jean-Luc Picard on TV's "Star Trek: The Next Generation") 
expertly calibrates his reading. 
</P>
<P>
In black suit and white shirt, he creates a world with a desk and a chair -- 
slicing the air with the pages of his script, grousing as the diffident 
Scrooge, snarling as the furtive one, bursting into wrenching sobs as Bob 
Cratchit, breaking our hearts as Tiny Tim and chuckling with uncontrollable 
glee as the rehabilitated old miser. 
</P>
<P>
It all works. The bleakness of Dickens' rigorous imagery and suspense, in 
collusion with the actor's virtuosity, even in as familiar a story as this, 
keeps us surprisingly close to the edge of our seats. 
</P>

Feuding Women: One more crack about her producers and Delta Burke might have to 
kiss "Designing Women" goodby. Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, a producer of the CBS 
show, said in this week's TV Guide she has almost lost patience with Burke, who 
has complained for months that she doesn't get enough recognition and respect 
on the set. "She seems to be continuing to escalate the situation to a point 
where a choice has to be made -- and a choice will be made," 
Bloodworth-Thomason told the magazine. BETH KLEID

'CHRISTMAS MEMORY' FRAYED AT THE EDGES

Truman Capote's "A Christmas Memory" is an evanescent paean to childhood that 
loses much of its texture in E.R. Haire's one-man performance at Theatre 6470 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Haire and director Peter Spellos have broken from traditional two-character 
stagings and produced the show with only the man/boy narrator figure. 
</P>
<P>
But Haire is not a strong enough actor to pull off Capote's memory by himself. 
We must see the youth's pixilated relationship with his sixtysomething lady 
cousin in Depression-locked Alabama, not just hear about her. 
</P>
<P>
Haire has the open-faced wonder to be in the past and narrate from the present. 
But his portrait of the boy's daft cousin, her pennies and pecans and dog 
Queenie and their remarkable partnership making fruitcake for the villagers, is 
blunted by the recitative nature of Haire's presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The story doesn't have the gritty ripeness of Dylan Thomas' "A Child's 
Christmas in Wales," but it is an indelible part of Christmas literature. Even 
a flawed production has value. Its kite imagery at the end is spellbinding. RAY 
LOYND

PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;

<P>
'SUPPER': HEAVY ON THE CLICHES 
</P>

The Open Gate Theatre -- a talented, multicultural group of musicians, dancers 
and performance artists -- has seen sharper days. In an amateurish evening at 
the First Congregational Church in Pasadena on Saturday, the company dredged up 
many of the prevailing cliches of contemporary performance art. 
</P>
<P>
Rika Ohara's "Shelter IV 1/2: The Last Supper," the featured work on the bill, 
continued the artist's ongoing exploration of "awaiting nuclear destruction in 
a glass shelter the size of the Berlin Olympic Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
In a series of black and white tableaux, a huge gauze-draped cross in the 
background, four performers (Ohara, Carol Cetrone, DeEn Swayden and Will 
Salmon) writhed, twitched and convulsed in slow motion in their chairs. As 
minimalist- and Balinese-flavored music played and abstract slides were 
superimposed on the back wall, Maria Bodmann, Cliff DeArment and John Payne 
completed the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"An Epitaph for Man," a text by Yukio Mishima, was read on a voice-over by 
Willy Bagot. Full of aphorisms about the failings of humankind, it reduced 
Ohara's clean images to the familiar sentimentality of so many after-the-bomb 
artworks of the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Billed as a work in progress, Ohara's performance nonetheless evinced a 
professionalism woefully absent from the three brief solos also on the program: 
a woman-breaks-free dance by Dagmar Stanec; an embarrassing text-based duo 
recounting anecdotes about racism by MA Bell and Margo Palluchi; and Will 
Salmon's amusingly simian, if self-indulgent, "Tree Dance." JAN BRESLAUER

CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: LOCAL RESORTS ADAPT TO SNOW-FREE WINTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

When the first big snow hits the San Bernardino Mountains, the flatlanders 
descend upon the town of Running Springs like an avalanche. Their ski-laden 
cars and pickups clog the roads and turn the town's tiny commercial center into 
a parking lot. The winter visitors get stuck in snow banks, track slush into 
shops and use the restrooms without buying anything. 
</P>
<P>
People up here just love them. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get them in and out of here fast enough," said Dicky Brouelli, 
assistant cook at Don Pepe's Casa Blanca restaurant. "This town goes crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Running Springs and mountain towns like it all over 
California, the past five winters have been short on the big snows. Down below, 
in the rest of Southern California, drought conditions and warm weather make 
flatlanders more inclined to visit the shore than the slopes. Despite a growing 
year-round population, the dry conditions can mean fewer customers for nearly 
every establishment in town, from the ski area to the video rental shop to the 
kids who put on tire chains for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
Snowfall "affects the whole economy of the hill," said Frank Brown, manager of 
Fantasy Video in Running Springs, which also sells tire chains to those caught 
in unexpected snow storms. "If (winter visitors) stay in one of the motels, 
they come to one of the two shops in town to rent videos." 
</P>
<P>
While December is not known for heavy snowfall, the lonely patches of the white 
stuff surrounded by dry grass only remind locals of the recent spate of poor 
winters. And with less than three weeks before the all-important Christmas and 
New Year holidays, local youngsters wandered around Hilltop Boulevard, the 
commercial spine of Running Springs, in shorts and T-shirts in the midday 
warmth. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just holding our breath and waiting for the snow," said Peggy Parson, 
who works the counter part time at Grumpy's Bakery and Deli. "We're dead right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Merchants in this town perched 6,000 feet above sea level say they have managed 
well without the normal winter seasons, although the winter season is "the 
cream for the people up here," said R. Keith Simpson, who moved out of Laguna 
Beach two years ago to set up a mountaintop medical practice. "If there is a 
decent season, they really have some money to set aside." 
</P>
<P>
"That's when you make your big margins and big sales," said Running Springs 
Hardware store owner Ron Pof, whose strong sales of home repair and remodeling 
supplies have more than offset the lackluster performance of such winter 
products as snow tires and sleds. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter's sporadic snowfall left Pof, a former electrical engineer, with 
plenty of hard-to-sell cold-weather products. "I got real desperate around 
February. I couldn't give away snow blowers or snow tires." 
</P>
<P>
Five miles east of Running Springs on winding Highway 18, signs draped over the 
entrance to Snow Valley Ski Resort proclaim a "$25 Special" on lift tickets and 
"Sale! 20% to 70% Off" at a ski shop. The middle of the week finds only four 
chairs of the 13 chairlifts in operation and a few skiers making runs down the 
machine-made snowpack. 
</P>
<P>
"If it rained down there, we would just be packed up here," said general 
manager Benno J. Nager, looking out upon the nearly silent slopes of the 
53-year-old resort. Nager says Snow Valley has remained profitable despite poor 
snow conditions that reduced the number of skier visits to 150,000 last winter 
from 250,000 during a normal season. 
</P>
<P>
However, the sharp decline in skiers and the expense of snow making -- which 
has already reached nearly $100,000 this season -- leaves less money for $5 
million worth of expansion and renovation projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Those plans are entirely dependent on the success of the coming ski season," 
said Nager, who notes that his problems and those of other ski resorts in the 
area reverberate into neighboring towns. "A bad season has a negative effect 
all the way down the line." 
</P>
<P>
Carol and Bill Carlisle have also had to cut back on improvement projects at 
their nine-unit Cloud 9 Lodge in Running Springs. Instead of buying new 
mattresses and carpeting all at once, the couple have decided to spread the 
projects over two years. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had good skiing up here, we'd be full seven days a week," said Carol 
Carlisle. "It's the midweek business, it's running one-third full. Sometimes 
it's even less than that. We can survive. But it makes it a lot tougher. The 
money doesn't come in and you're just sitting there." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Carlisles and other Running Springs merchants are not about to sell 
out and move out of the town that began as a lumber mill settlement nearly a 
century ago. The 6,000 residents of the unincorporated town and surrounding 
communities were lured here by the small-town atmosphere that they believe 
offers a cleaner, safer lifestyle than what is generally available down at the 
"bottom of the hill" in the rest of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of life up here is quite good," said Simpson, whose practice 
features a vintage medical cabinet and the medicine kit and microscope owned by 
his great grandfather, a Civil War physician. "It's far superior to my life 
down in the beach communities." 
</P>
<P>
The lifestyle and relatively inexpensive housing have lead to a surge in 
full-time locals. Realtor Kay Fugate says her sales are running ahead of last 
year, and more than half of the buyers plan to live up here year-round. "That 
is quite a difference. The percentage of (full-time) sales has increased over 
the last five years." 
</P>
<P>
The change has lead many merchants to beef-up customer service to cater to the 
growing pool of year-round residents, who often shop down below for lower 
prices and better selection. 
</P>
<P>
After buying Mountain Mercantile earlier this year, Patty Houk and her husband 
have remodeled the grocery store, added fancy new products such as stuffed pork 
chops and banned the cashier from smoking on the job. 
</P>
<P>
During the winter season, "our business improves, but we don't depend on it," 
said Houk, who says out-of-towners account for 25% of sales during January and 
February. "We want to cater to the locals . . . and customer service is our 
main thing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is nothing like a blanket of new snow to send business soaring. 
"You couldn't even walk in the store on weekends -- it was mobbed," said Houk, 
who clerked at the store before buying it. "But that was six or seven years 
ago."

AILING LONE STAR INDUSTRIES SEEKS TO REORGANIZE; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION: ONCE THE TOP U.S. CEMENT MAKER, IT HAS REJECTED TWO BUYOUT BIDS 
AND HAS FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 PROTECTION. IT BLAMES FOREIGN COMPETITION AND THE 
BUILDING SLUMP.

Cement maker Lone Star Industries, facing continued losses amid a building 
recession and tough foreign competition, filed for reorganization Monday under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
The Stamford, Conn.-based company, for many years the largest U.S. cement 
maker, said it had considered two buyout proposals from foreign buyers, but 
after weighing them and "other alternatives, concluded that shareholders would 
be better off if the company availed itself of Chapter 11." 
</P>
<P>
Lone Star said it intended to remain open for business as it sells assets and 
tries to complete a year-old program of restructuring around core operations. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which lost $13 million on sales of $338 million last year, filed 
along with several subsidiaries in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y. 
In its papers, Lone Star said that as of Oct. 31, its assets came to $1.066 
billion and its liabilities totaled $703 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company didn't elaborate on the acquisition offers or the other 
alternatives it considered. A spokesman, James A. Powers, did not return 
repeated calls. 
</P>
<P>
Lone Star stock fell $2.125 a share to $2.625 in New York Stock Exchange 
trading, suggesting that the market may have been taken by surprise by the 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement, Lone Star sought to blame foreign competition, noting that 
the U.S. government recently found Mexican manufacturers guilty of selling 
cement below cost in the United States to gain market share. "Unfortunately, 
this ruling is several years too late," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts say at least some of the blame lies in Lone Star's 
strategy of selling off assets to raise cash, allowing it to pay a dividend 
that would keep its stock price high. Over the course of several years, the 
plan has forced the company to part with key assets, leaving it with weaker 
ones, critics contend. 
</P>
<P>
"All through the '80s, they systematically sold or joint-ventured their best 
assets," said Jonathan Goldfarb, analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New 
York. While foreign imports and the building slowdown have hurt, "Lone Star has 
been very poorly managed," Goldfarb said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other assets, Lone Star sold all or parts of companies in Hawaii, 
California, Maryland and the Pacific Northwest, the analysts noted. In 
California, for example, Lone Star spent aggressively to expand its operations 
but then, in the past two years, sold about half of those assets, said Michael 
J. London, who resigned as Lone Star's public relations chief last July. 
</P>
<P>
"They've ended up holding the weaker assets," said London, who operates a 
public relations agency in Trumbull, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Other events have hurt Lone Star's credibility. Last year, it introduced a 
product called polymer-granite stone, then had to abruptly close down the 
production plant when it appeared that the manufacturing process didn't work, 
said London. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lone Star has been criticized for the alleged heavy 
expense-account spending of its chairman and chief executive, James E. Stewart. 
Business Week magazine cited internal documents showing that Stewart had spent 
$2.9 million in 1989 on an airplane, helicopter and lodging when his company 
faced deep difficulties.

RETRENCHMENT AT SECURITY PACIFIC; 
</P>
<P>
MORE BANKS, S&amp;LS EXPECTED TO BOOST LOSS RESERVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Security Pacific Corp. is not the first banking firm to announce that 1990 
earnings will be badly hurt by souring loans and additional loan-loss reserves. 
And it's not likely to be the last. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of other big banks and thrifts -- already resigned to a year of 
disappointing earnings and lackluster stock performance -- are likely to make 
similar announcements in coming weeks, analysts said. Up to one-fifth of the 
nation's large and mid-sized banks are primed to add significant amounts to 
reserves -- a cushion for loan losses -- which is likely to decimate 
fourth-quarter earnings, several bank analysts said. And virtually all of the 
nation's biggest thrifts will do the same, savings and loan experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are assuming that nearly everyone is going to add to reserves," said Jim 
Wilson, an S&amp;L analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "We 
expect all the major (thrifts) to show a loss for the quarter because of it, 
and they'll probably bring year-end earnings right down to zero." 
</P>
<P>
Savers and most borrowers will generally not be affected by the losses and poor 
earnings, analysts noted. However, real estate developers and corporate 
takeover artists may find it harder to borrow money as banks restrict credit to 
riskier ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the writeoffs, most of the big banks and thrifts as of now are far 
from being in danger of insolvency or failure. But a severe, prolonged 
recession could result in even more writeoffs that could damage industry 
health. 
</P>
<P>
The companies most likely to announce writeoffs within the next few weeks 
include Los Angeles-based H. F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., parent of Home Savings of 
America; it is expected to take a $147-million addition to reserves, causing it 
to post about an $80-million quarterly loss, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery Securities is also projecting that Los Angeles-based CalFed, parent 
of California Federal Bank, will add $64 million to reserves and post a 
$112-million quarterly loss. GlenFed, Great Western Financial and Golden West 
Financial -- all among the nation's biggest thrift companies -- will set aside 
a total of $300 million during the quarter, according to an analysis by the San 
Francisco-based investment house. GlenFed is parent of Glendale Federal Bank, 
while Great Western Financial is parent of Great Western Bank and Golden West 
is parent of World Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the nation's biggest banks -- including Chase Manhattan -- 
have already announced plans to boost loan-loss reserves and reduce profits, 
more such announcements are on the horizon, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Citicorp, the nation's biggest banking company, is widely 
expected to announce a substantial writeoff within the next several weeks, 
analysts said. And a wide variety of smaller banks headquartered in the 
Northeast and South could also follow suit, said Thaddeus Paluszek, bank 
analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
However, the other big California banking firms -- Wells Fargo &amp; Co., 
BankAmerica and First Interstate Bancorp -- probably do not need to boost 
reserves, several analysts said. These companies already have more than enough 
cash set aside to handle all foreseeable loan problems, according to Paluszek. 
</P>
<P>
Although the rush to add to reserves seems to be sweeping the financial 
services industry, the problems these banks and thrifts are trying to address 
vary widely. Some banks, such as Security Pacific, are grappling with 
diversification efforts gone awry. Some have souring commercial real estate 
loans, while others have been hit hard by bad business credits. 
</P>
<P>
But the reason for the rush to put the money away now instead of later is 
standard, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
This year has simply been bad for financial company earnings and for financial 
stocks. Consequently, many institutions believe that it is in their best 
interests to push all their bad news into this already rotten year, Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After its announcement, Security Pacific's stock price shot up $1 per share to 
close at $23 in New York Stock Exchange trading Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Other bank and thrift stocks also rose. Citicorp's stock climbed 25 cents per 
share to finish at $15, while Wells Fargo's stock rose $1.25 per share to end 
at $56.50 and BankAmerica gained 50 cents per share to close at $24.50. Stocks 
of H. F. Ahmanson and Golden West both rose 37.5 cents per share, to $13.875 
and $24.375, respectively.

RETRENCHMENT AT SECURITY PACIFIC; 
</P>
<P>
CLOSING OF MERCHANT BANKING UNIT MEANS END TO EXECUTIVE'S DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The dissolution of Security Pacific's merchant banking arm ends the dream of 
David R. Lovejoy, who made a name for himself as an aggressive -- and many say 
abrasive -- competitor at the helm of the bank division. 
</P>
<P>
Lovejoy did not take phone calls Monday. Rival Los Angeles investment bankers 
said there is no doubt that the decision to disband the merchant banking unit 
was a huge disappointment to Lovejoy. Security Pacific said Lovejoy will depart 
after a transitional period. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old executive was a protege of Security Chairman Richard J. Flamson 
III. Lovejoy joined the firm in 1970 and ran the bank's European, Middle 
Eastern and African businesses from 1976 to 1981, based in London. He served as 
treasurer of Security, and since 1985 has guided the merchant-banking arm. He 
also is vice chairman of Security. 
</P>
<P>
One of Security's major merchant-banking thrusts under Lovejoy was the 
so-called securitization of the bank's mortgage portfolio and other assets. 
Loans were packaged and sold in pieces to investors, which earned the bank 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Lovejoy also guided the bank into overseas corporate finance and merger 
advisement in the United States. Indeed, Security made no secret in the '80s 
that merchant banking was the bank's great hope for the future. Now, the bank 
clearly is admitting it erred. 
</P>
<P>
Though many top Security Pacific executives said they respected Lovejoy, some 
competitors said his style was aggressive with clients and with his own staff. 
</P>
<P>
"He unnecessarily stepped on heads," one rival investment banker who, as is 
typical in the banking business, refused to talk about a competitor unless he 
was promised anonymity. This competitor said that, as treasurer of the company, 
Lovejoy alienated Wall Street brokerages "who could have helped him later" in 
syndicating business. 
</P>
<P>
Security CEO Robert H. Smith insisted that he and Lovejoy remain on good terms. 
But some rivals speculated that with Flamson ill, Lovejoy has lost his mentor, 
and that Smith has been forced to extract Security from merchant banking 
activities grown far too risky given the merger drought and general economic 
slowdown.

Eagle-Picher Asbestos Suits Consolidated: U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein 
said he will create a class action consolidating 65,000 asbestos injury claims 
against Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. Attorneys for the victims said they would 
fight Weinstein's attempts to consolidate the cases, saying the company's 
$625-million long-term settlement plan is not enough. Weinstein faces an 
additional roadblock in the form of a petition filed Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court in Cincinnati seeking to force the Cincinnati-based industrial products 
manufacturer involuntarily into bankruptcy proceedings. Under federal law, the 
bankruptcy petition puts all other court action on hold.

OPEC Meeting Will Begin: Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries arrived in Vienna for talks that are likely to leave intact a boost 
in oil production approved last August after Iraq invaded Kuwait. This is 
OPEC's annual winter meeting, which begins Wednesday and is normally used to 
map out production and pricing plans for the coming year. But this year members 
will examine various scenarios for the future so they will be prepared to act 
once the Persian Gulf standoff ends.

GE Says PCBs Break Down Naturally: General Electric Co. released a report that 
it says shows the natural biodegradation of polychlorinated biphenyls in New 
York's Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
The company had dumped PCBs in the river for about 25 years, when the practice 
was legal and before the substances were suspected of harming human health. 
Recently, the state has proposed dredging the river to remove the contaminated 
material to a landfill. GE said its results match those of a 1984 New York 
Department of Environmental Conservation report, but it couldn't say whether 
the natural process would rid the river of all PCBs.

HURDLE CLEARED FOR COLUMBIA S&amp;L BOND SALE; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE U.S. ADOPTS A NEW POLICY ON HOW TO HANDLE SUCH DEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A policy adopted last week by federal officials removes a major hurdle for 
ailing Columbia Savings &amp; Loan to sell its collection of junk bonds, most 
recently valued at $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's previous agreement to sell the bonds for $3 billion to a 
Canadian-led partnership, in a deal that the Beverly Hills-based thrift would 
have financed through a note, was scrapped in September by federal savings and 
loan regulators. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons cited for the deal's cancellation was that the 
government lacked a policy for financing such a sale. Last week, however, the 
board overseeing the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency mopping up the 
thrift mess, approved a broad policy expanding the ability of thrifts to 
finance similar transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most insolvent thrifts, Columbia has not been taken over by the 
government because regulators would like to sell the junk bonds first in a 
private sale. But the thrift is insolvent by $710 million, stemming from the 
free fall in the value of its junk bond portfolio, and has acknowledged in 
public documents that it will probably be seized eventually. Because the thrift 
is so troubled, regulators want the terms in any sale to follow their own 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, seven groups have expressed interest. Of those, four 
are believed to be favorites. They are the Gordon partnership and groups led by 
three Wall Street firms -- Salomon Bros., Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and the 
Lehman Bros. unit of Shearson Lehman Bros. Holdings. The Salomon group is 
believed to also include Citicorp and the investment firm Odyssey Partners. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the new policy, Columbia executives are expected to begin more 
detailed talks with prospective bidders this month.

LABOR: HUSSEIN MAY HELP U.S. SHIPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You may never have heard of a tiny, southwest Pacific island group called 
Vanuatu that was once known as New Hebrides and became an independent nation in 
1980, with a population of just 115,000. 
</P>
<P>
But then you probably don't own a shipping company either. 
</P>
<P>
If you did, you would know that Vanuatu has joined Liberia, Panama, the Bahamas 
and a few other countries that for years have been selling "flags of 
convenience," which, along with drastic cuts in U.S. shipbuilding, have helped 
break the once-proud U.S. maritime industry. Due to some tricky maritime laws, 
it is highly profitable for American shipping companies to buy the use of the 
flags of those small countries, which have no fleets of their own. Flying the 
flags lets the companies escape most U.S. taxes, even minimal safety and health 
rules and almost all fair labor standards. 
</P>
<P>
Shipping companies in other countries too save a small fortune every time one 
of their vessels sails under the "protection" of a flag of convenience. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-owned companies also avoid paying wages and benefits earned by 
American sailors who work under American flags. 
</P>
<P>
The flag-switching game has caused a devastating reduction in the number of 
ships flying the American flag, dropping it to 379 today from more than 5,000 
after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The number of jobs for U.S. sailors has dropped in just 20 years from nearly 
40,000 to about 9,000, which means there isn't much left of the sailing side of 
our merchant marine industry. 
</P>
<P>
Our sailors cannot live on the low wages paid to most foreign workers. Today, 
nearly 80% of all unlicensed seamen on merchant ships of the world are from 
Asia, mostly the southeastern part -- not because they are the best but because 
they are the cheapest and the most easily exploited. 
</P>
<P>
Maritime unions of several countries have managed to get agreements with many 
large shipping companies that theoretically set minimum wages. While companies 
frequently cheat on the agreements, the amount foreign sailors are supposed to 
get shows why the flags of Vanuatu and other small nations are so attractive to 
shipping firms. A foreign seaman is supposed to get $275 a month for working on 
an American-owned ship flying a flag of convenience. The pay jumps to $1,569 a 
month for those working on a ship flying the U.S. flag. 
</P>
<P>
The shipbuilding side of our maritime industry is also pretty much a thing of 
the past. There is only one oceangoing ship that will fly an American flag now 
under construction in the United States. It is being built in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the once-flourishing Todd Shipyard in San Pedro, which employed more 
than 6,000 at its peak, closed after 72 years, unable to compete against 
low-wage, government-subsidized foreign yards. Todd's San Pedro yard wasn't 
even able to compete against the few remaining U.S. shipyards, mostly because 
there was constant strife between managers and workers. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers, the 
former Todd workers now have a chance to reopen at least part of the San Pedro 
facility under an employee stock ownership plan set up by retired Navy Adm. 
Stuart F. Platt and a union financial consultant, Brian Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
But the City of Los Angeles, which owns the property and equipment, isn't ready 
to help Todd's former workers lease the property for a small sum initially and 
then buy it outright later. Instead, the city agreed to let a group of former 
Todd managers first try to negotiate an agreement to take over the operation. 
The former managers don't want a yard owned by the workers, and they are 
convinced that their plan is more viable than an employee-owned one, says the 
managers' human resources director, John Cherensky, who was captain of the 
battleship USS Missouri until June. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, the employee adviser, said the yard failed under the leadership of the 
ex-managers, and he predicts that they won't be able to finance their deal and 
that that will leave the field open for the employee ownership plan. 
</P>
<P>
One way or another, it looks as though the shipyard may be in business again 
soon -- after the financial battle ends between the managers following the 
former Navy captain and the workers led by the retired admiral. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for that happy prospect, and perhaps a brighter future for the 
industry in general, is that the crisis over Iraq's aggression in the Gulf has 
stimulated renewed concern over the deplorable state of our maritime industry. 
Saddam Hussein has helped publicize how unprepared we are to use our own ships 
and crews in a military emergency. 
</P>
<P>
But there is also need for revitalizing the industry for commercial reasons. 
America is still the largest trading nation in the world, but U.S. ships flying 
the American flag carry only 3.9% of our own waterborne commerce. Forty-five 
percent is carried by ships shamefully flying those flags so convenient and 
profitable for shipping companies and so economically disastrous for American 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Other foreign ships carry the rest of our waterborne commerce under their own 
flags. Congress is now considering legislation to curb the exploitative use of 
flags of convenience, but passage won't come easily. 
</P>
<P>
Even more difficult will be to regain our shipbuilding prowess, which was lost 
for many reasons -- such as foreign governments' direct subsidies to their 
shipbuilders, foreign government guarantees for low-interest loans, outright 
state ownership of shipyards and favorable tax laws. Such advantages are rare 
in this country. 
</P>
<P>
These factors are entangled in the latest round of global trade negotiations, 
which are bogged down badly. However, thanks in part to the aggression of 
Saddam Hussein, there is a new awareness in this country of the need to revive 
our meager shipbuilding industry and provide decent jobs for those who want to 
sail in our merchant marine fleet.

MOTOROLA, TOSHIBA FORM JOINT HDTV CHIP VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Motorola Inc. and Toshiba Corp. have agreed to work together in developing 
semiconductor chips for Japan's high-definition television system, a 
development that could help Motorola gain an edge over its U.S. competitors in 
a market that's expected to be extremely lucrative over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
The venture is also the first in which American and Japanese chip firms have 
joined forces to pursue HDTV, a group of technologies that will drastically 
improve television picture quality. 
</P>
<P>
HDTV has been the subject of a protracted worldwide battle over technical 
standards, and Motorola and Toshiba will be working on chips for the HDTV 
system developed by the Japan Broadcasting Corp. That system is now undergoing 
a trial in Japan, but the United States will not make a decision on technical 
standards for HDTV until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Though it is certain that the United States will not adopt the Japanese system, 
Motorola will still gain expertise from its work with Toshiba -- work that 
could prove useful in making parts for American HDTV. 
</P>
<P>
"What they learn will give them a leg up," said Dean McCarron, an analyst with 
In-Stat, a Phoenix-based market research firm. "They're not letting an 
opportunity slip past." 
</P>
<P>
Motorola and Toshiba will develop components to translate the HDTV broadcast 
signal -- which is transmitted in a coded format to accommodate the vast amount 
of information needed for HDTV -- into a usable picture. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola already has a joint venture with Toshiba for the development and 
production of memory chips. Motorola has long had a far more significant 
presence in Japan than other U.S. chip companies, and the company reportedly 
plans to build a new, $600-million factory in northern Japan, scheduled for 
completion for 1993.

NEW GROWTH INDUSTRY: LIQUIDATORS OF FAILED RETAILERS; 
</P>
<P>
BANKRUPTCY: IT'S A PROFESSION THAT SOME SAY LACKED RESPECTABILITY ONLY A DECADE 
AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
National Lumber, Pacific Stereo and Gemco are a few of the local retailers that 
have gone belly up in recent years. In those cases and many more, either Albert 
Nassi or David Buxbaum was called in to bury the remains. 
</P>
<P>
Nassi and Buxbaum are liquidators, who fly around the country to sell whatever 
inventory a failed retailer has left. It's a profession some might not have 
mentioned in polite conversation a decade ago. Nassi, president of Sam Nassi 
Co., a Calabasas firm co-founded and named after his late father, remembers his 
dad being described as a "corporate mortician." 
</P>
<P>
"Where are your emotions?" the younger Nassi recalled people asking his father. 
"They'd say, 'How can you put these people out of a job?' Well, somebody has to 
do it, and you might as well use a professional." 
</P>
<P>
More and more troubled stores -- or their creditors or their bankruptcy 
trustees -- are doing just that. Nassi, Buxbaum's Encino firm, Buxbaum Ginsberg 
&amp; Associates, and other liquidators are now viewed as savvy marketers who 
can get the stores' creditors the most bang for the buck when they hold a 
going-out-of-business sale. 
</P>
<P>
They're also likely to be in greater demand over the next few years. Many 
retailers today are hobbling under piles of debt they incurred in the 1980s, 
often to avoid a hostile takeover. Throw in the recession now hanging over the 
economy generally, and Buxbaum said liquidation "is the growth business of the 
'90s." 
</P>
<P>
Nassi agreed. "A lot of retailers are making their last stand with this year's 
Christmas, and I think that come January there will be quite a few more retail 
liquidations." 
</P>
<P>
Both men run private firms and declined to spell out their financial results. 
But Nassi is by far the larger, expecting to handle about $500 million worth of 
close-out sales this year, and it considers itself one of the largest 
liquidators in the nation along with Schottenstein Stores Corp. in Columbus, 
Ohio. Buxbaum will handle about $50 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
The firms earn their income in different ways. Buxbaum charges a fee, usually 
between 2% and 10% of the proceeds from the going-out-of-business sale. (That 
would give it annual revenue of roughly $2.5 million to $3 million.) 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Nassi often buys a store's inventory for a certain price, then 
holds the close-out sale. Whatever cash the sale generates above what Nassi 
paid for the goods goes into Nassi's pocket. (He'll only say his firm's annual 
revenue exceeds $10 million.) 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Ames Department Stores, a Rocky Hill, Conn.-based chain that 
filed for bankruptcy reorganization last April, recently had Nassi and 
Schottenstein Stores jointly liquidate 221 of its 682 stores. 
</P>
<P>
With help from their lenders, Nassi and Schottenstein first bought the 
inventory to be liquidated for $211 million, Nassi said. The stores' close-out 
sales last August generated $240 million, so the extra $29 million was shared 
as the gross income, before expenses, by Nassi and Schottenstein. Of course, 
had the sales garnered less than $211 million, the liquidators would have taken 
a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't troubled stores just hold a going-out-of-business sale themselves and 
save having to pay Nassi or Buxbaum? 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Hershfield, a New York lawyer who represents Ames' creditors, said "it's 
generally a sound approach" to hire liquidators because in cases such as Ames, 
"they assume the risk of not being able to sell everything. It's their 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Good liquidators also know how to generate the most traffic for the sales -- 
which typically last eight to 10 weeks -- and how to keep costs down in the 
meantime, Buxbaum said. Both mean more money for the creditors after the store 
closes. 
</P>
<P>
"We can do it for less cost because we don't have the sentimental attachment" 
to the business, said Buxbaum, 64, who keeps his office in his Encino house 
because he's on the road three weeks a month supervising sales. 
</P>
<P>
Going-out-of-business sales inherently draw customers, because the merchandise 
is almost always marked down. But Buxbaum takes no chances. 
</P>
<P>
A store's top credit customers are often invited to a "preview" of the sale, 
catered with wine and cheese. Buxbaum also tries to generate publicity for the 
sale not only with advertising but by drumming up media stories if he can find 
an angle. Case in point: At a Wichita, Kan., store, he dressed its window 
mannequins with clothing made from newspapers. Local newspapers and television 
stations quickly made it a story, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Nassi formed his company with partner David Bernstein in 1971, and 
Bernstein remains chairman. Both were officers in California with the White 
Front department store chain, but when it went broke, they ended up liquidating 
their employer and then stayed in the business of closing stores, Albert Nassi 
said. Among their biggest liquidations was the W. T. Grant department store 
chain in 1975, which had $1 billion worth of merchandise and 980 stores. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Buxbaum also got into liquidations because of the White Front 
collapse. He had been running discount health-food stores inside White Front 
stores. But when White Front went under, he was forced to liquidate his stores 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Buxbaum said he later worked for several other liquidators before starting his 
own firm in 1978. Eventually, his son, Paul, and former May Co. executive Ira 
Ginsberg joined the firm, and today each owns a third of Buxbaum Ginsberg &amp; 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Buxbaum said he knew in the late-1970s that liquidation "was going to be a big 
business" because he could see smaller, regional retailers being squeezed by 
large national department stores that had bigger marketing budgets and 
"superstores" that focused in one area -- say sporting goods, home-improvement 
products or home electronics. Now, many of those larger chains, such as Ames, 
are in trouble as well and that probably means more business for the corporate 
undertakers. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be happy running one job," Buxbaum said. "Now we're running three 
or four jobs at one time."

ARMAND HAMMER DIES; BILLIONAIRE, ART PATRON; 
</P>
<P>
INDUSTRIALIST: THE CAREER OF THE 92-YEAR-OLD ENTREPRENEUR WHO LED OCCIDENTAL 
OIL SPANNED SEVEN DECADES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Armand Hammer, the financial entrepreneur whose extraordinary career spanned 
seven decades and half a dozen different businesses and whose avocation as a 
collector of art added to an already controversial life, died Monday at his 
home in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer, 92, died following a brief illness, said a spokesman for Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had designated a successor, Hammer remained chairman and chief 
executive of Los Angeles-based Occidental, a company he built from a nearly 
bankrupt wildcat drilling firm into the 16th largest industrial corporation in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors about his health had surfaced periodically since he had a pacemaker 
implant in November, 1989, but each time he recovered from whatever ailment he 
might have been battling and appeared in public, successfully putting those 
rumors to rest. 
</P>
<P>
His last appearance was this month at a party celebrating the opening of what 
proved his final dream, the Armand Hammer Museum and Cultural Center in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
He had scheduled one final event but did not live to attend -- his bar mitzvah, 
which was scheduled for today . That ceremony, which normally signals the entry 
of a Jewish male into manhood at age 13, was to have been a fund raiser for two 
Jewish institutions. Hammer explained the 79-year delay in the ceremony by 
saying that his socialist father had dispensed with religious observances when 
he was a child. 
</P>
<P>
"He touched so many of our lives and careers that his creativity, enthusiasm 
and unyielding sense of optimism will be sorely missed," said Dr. Ray Irani who 
has been elected to succeed Hammer as chairman and chief executive officer of 
Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
The billionaire industrialist had cut a flamboyant swath throughout his 
colorful and varied career. A public figure comfortable with royalty, heads of 
state, the rich and famous, he stirred up controversy among not only ardent 
admirers of his keen intelligence and bold strategies but also scathing critics 
who questioned his ethics and powerful ego. A man of immense wealth, he endowed 
schools, museums and cancer research centers with gifts totaling tens of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
He maintained his daunting schedule until his death. An inveterate world 
traveler, he concluded major contracts for Occidental with foreign governments, 
made frequent public appearances at home and abroad, bought art for his 
estimated $450-million art collection and received countless awards and honors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, because of his early ties with the Soviet Union, Hammer retained 
access to that country's leaders which were remarkable for a private U.S. 
citizen. In 1980, for example, after the USSR's invasion of Afghanistan 
precipitated a crisis between the two countries, Hammer met with then Soviet 
President Leonid I. Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
In a self-appointed quest for peace, Hammer attempted to persuade Brezhnev to 
pull his troops out of the country and afterward clarified for reporters 
Brezhnev's comments on the situation. He continued to make trips to Moscow 
throughout much of the 1980s in what he described as efforts to find a solution 
to the conflict, which eventually was resolved with a Soviet pullout from the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, following the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster, Hammer helped 
arrange and pay for the emergency visit of an international bone marrow 
transplant team to aid the victims of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1988 Hammer rushed to the Soviet Union with a planeload of relief aid, 
including $1-million in checks and several million dollars in emergency medical 
supplies, following the earthquake that ravaged Soviet Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer was such a frequent visitor to Moscow that the Soviets maintained a 
luxurious private apartment for him in an otherwise drab-looking building on a 
quiet, dead-end street about five minutes from the Kremlin. Across the street 
for many years was the famous Tretyakov art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how a man his age mustered the prodigious energy to constantly circle the 
globe in his Boeing 727 private aircraft to meet with various heads of state, 
Hammer said, "I love my work. I can't wait to start a new day. I never wake up 
without being full of ideas. Everything is a challenge. I love to negotiate, to 
make a deal, to accomplish what I'm after." 
</P>
<P>
While Hammer's career with Occidental was his final and most satisfying one, it 
was only the most recent in a series of successful ventures that began when he 
was a student. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the Bronx in 1898, Hammer was the son of a physician and small 
businessman, Julian Hammer, a radical socialist and a power in the Socialist 
Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
Educated as a medical doctor at Columbia University's College of Physicians and 
Surgeons, Armand Hammer salvaged his family's faltering pharmaceutical business 
by day while studying at night. 
</P>
<P>
He ended up earning $1 million before he graduated in 1921, in part by buying 
vast quantities of whiskey just before Prohibition and selling it later as 
medicine to drugstores. He never practiced medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer traveled to the Soviet Union later in 1921, equipped with an ambulance 
and fully stocked World War I surplus field hospital, to help the country 
ravaged by revolution. Instead, witnessing the massive starvation, he worked 
out a deal to swap U.S. grain for Russian hides and furs. The grain contract 
won the attention of Vladimir I. Lenin, who befriended Hammer -- an association 
that enabled him to retain close ties with Soviet leadership no matter what the 
political climate was between his homeland and Russia, the land of his 
ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
In a long-ago interview with The Times, Hammer reminisced about his meetings 
with Lenin: 
</P>
<P>
"He had such an influence over me. He was terrifically charming. He had the 
kind of charm Franklin D. Roosevelt had. He won me over with his sincerity. 
When he told me about the children crying for bread, there were tears in his 
eyes. He convinced me he was there to do a lot of good for the Russian people. 
I wanted to help him. It changed my whole life. He said, 'We don't need 
doctors, we need businessmen." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer stayed in Russia for nine years, during which he collected art treasures 
and represented dozens of U.S. companies, handling nearly all trade between the 
United States and Russia. He ran an asbestos concession in the Urals, and when 
that was cancelled in 1925, he set up a pencil factory, licensing technology 
from A. W. Faber of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Lenin's death, and the ascent of Joseph Stalin, caused Hammer to return to the 
United States in 1930. He set about building successive fortunes by dealing in 
the Czarist art he had collected, distilling whiskey and breeding Black Angus 
cattle. 
</P>
<P>
To market his "Romanov Treasures," Hammer arranged to sell the pieces through 
department stores. With his brother, Victor, who died in 1985, Hammer set up 
the Hammer Galleries on 57th Street in New York and proceeded to establish 
himself as liquidator of the William Randolph Hearst art collection. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he managed to build so many fortunes, Hammer responded: 
</P>
<P>
"A friend once said that Dr. Hammer will go into a business he knows nothing 
about and within weeks will know much more than anyone else in that business. I 
think that is true. I study so that I can pick up the phone and talk to any 
expert or scientist. That is the only way I can check where the trouble is. I 
can't wade through a lot of executives and wait for them to solve (a problem)." 
</P>
<P>
Moving to California in 1956, ostensibly to retire at the age of 58, Hammer 
invested $50,000 in two wells owned by a faltering oil company named Occidental 
Petroleum, more as a tax shelter than an investment. When the wells produced 
oil, he worked out a partnership with the drilling contractor -- and ended up 
launching his most spectacular career. 
</P>
<P>
Running his company with near-imperial control, Hammer became a key figure in 
the tumultuous upheavals that shortly engulfed the energy industry. 
</P>
<P>
His company earned the admiration of geologists around the world for its 
phenomenal success in locating oil in the Middle East, the North Sea and South 
America. But none of Oxy's finds was more significant than the rich deposits it 
discovered in Libya during the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
These discoveries catapulted Occidental into the big time, but they also 
imperiled the company in 1970 after Moammar Kadafi overthrew Hammer's good 
friend, King Idris. The new revolutionary government began demanding more money 
for its oil and threatened to confiscate Occidental's holdings if the company 
did not agree. 
</P>
<P>
Against the advice of his Board of Directors -- who feared he would be arrested 
-- Hammer flew to Libya to negotiate a new agreement. After a week he agreed to 
an increase of 30 cents a barrel. (Oil then sold for less than $2 a barrel.) 
Although no one knew it at the time, that minuscule increase was the beginning 
of the end of cheap oil, for other oil-producing countries soon followed 
Kadafi's lead. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement caused Hammer -- who never had been accepted as an industry 
"insider" -- to be regarded as a betrayer by the energy fraternity, a man who 
could not be trusted. Hammer countered their criticism by maintaining that the 
major firms did not lift a hand to help him with the Libyan negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
As Occidental -- which has branched out over the years into chemicals, coal and 
agriculture -- swiftly climbed up the ranks of the nation's largest 
corporations, shareholders were enriched by dividends and stock splits. They 
showered their affection and appreciation on Hammer every year at the annual 
meeting, which was held invariably on his birthday, May 21. Shareholders sang 
"Happy Birthday," read poems and made speeches extolling his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
With such high visibility, Hammer attracted both extravagant praise and harsh 
criticism. Both were exaggerated to some extent by his seemingly unquenchable 
thirst for publicity and self-promotion. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, watched Hammer closely 
from Oxy's early days, when the company issued optimistic press releases on its 
prospects and played down its problems. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1970s, the commission charged Occidental in four different actions 
with misdeeds ranging from giving out misleading earnings projections to using 
corporate funds for illegal political contributions and foreign payments. All 
ended in the signing of consent agreements in which the company neither 
admitted nor denied guilt. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC was not the only skeptic. Despite its phenomenal success, Occidental 
failed to win the approval of the Wall Street investment community, which 
regarded Hammer's inability to settle on a successor as a threat to the 
company's future. 
</P>
<P>
From 1970 through 1986 at least 10 executives who believed they were to be 
Hammer's heir apparent were eased out. Joseph Baird was president for a record 
six years, but resigned in July, 1979, after an attempt by Occidental to take 
over Mead Corp. failed. Zoltan Merszei, former chief executive and chairman of 
Dow Chemical Co., took over for one year, then was unseated by A. Robert 
Abboud, former chief executive of First Chicago Corp. 
</P>
<P>
At the time Abboud was named, Occidental stock dropped a point and investment 
bankers suggested that the move raised the question whether there was any 
long-term strategy or planning at the company. Analysts suggested that the 
company's stock, which sold at an extremely low price compared with earnings, 
would rise 10 points or more whenever Hammer stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
One securities analyst suggested that another reason for the weak stock showing 
was that "Oxy has a credibility problem. There's a feeling from the record that 
Oxy tends to gild the lily. There's always truth to what the company says, but 
it tends to make a good thing sound better. Armand Hammer is the P. T. Barnum 
of the oil business. He's a charming pitchman." 
</P>
<P>
The firm's current president, Ray R. Irani, was named to the leadership post in 
1986. But Occidental's fortunes remain somewhat quirky -- rising and falling 
based on Hammer's health. For example, in November, 1989, trading in Occidental 
stock was temporarily suspended on the New York Stock Exchange when Hammer was 
hospitalized. Prices in Occidental stock had surged in the past when Hammer was 
reported to be in ill health, because without the chairman's presence, the 
company would become a likely takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Hammer designated Irani as his business heir in an effort to 
stem the stock swings. 
</P>
<P>
In an otherwise effusively complimentary chapter on Hammer in his book 
"Reflections Without Mirrors," Louis Nizer, Hammer's friend and legal counsel 
for a quarter century, wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"In view of his (Hammer's) optimism and enthusiasm, his anticipation claims, 
while sincerely made, are not always realized. . . . So it came about that 
probably the most gifted businessman of our time, who has earned unprecedented 
accolades, has also been subjected to embarrassing skepticism." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously the shadow of mistrust cast over his achievements nettled a man of 
Hammer's pride. Nizer explained, "He (Hammer) is vulnerable because he has 
(former) President (Lyndon B.) Johnson's sensitivity to criticism. So he fights 
back with threats of libel suits and corrective letters to . . . publications." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer's most humiliating moment came in 1976 when he was fined $3,000 and 
placed on one year's probation for illegally making and concealing $54,000 in 
campaign contributions to the 1972 reelection campaign of then President 
Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Hammer's doctors, friends and associates feared that the strain of 
the crisis might induce a fatal heart attack. The industrialist entered a Los 
Angeles courtroom in a wheelchair, his heartbeat monitored by equipment 
specially set up in a nearby room. Because of his poor health, Hammer, in a 
plea bargain, agreed to plead guilty to three misdemeanor charges. The specter 
of a possible jail sentence induced in Hammer what he described as a 
"sympathetic heart problem, the result of the terrible pressure I felt." 
</P>
<P>
He was hospitalized with congestive heart failure and disturbance of cardiac 
rhythm. And even though his condition was confirmed by seven cardiologist -- 
including three appointed by the prosecution -- his court appearance and a 
subsequent remarkable recovery caused critics over the years to suggest that he 
exaggerated his problem for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Almost since the moment he entered his plea, Hammer vigorously protested his 
innocence and lobbied for an almost unheard of type of pardon in which the 
President would have declared that he was never guilty in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989 Hammer agreed to accept a conventional pardon, which President Bush 
quickly granted. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer told reporters after his 1989 pacemaker surgery that the procedure had 
substantiated his claim of heart ailments. 
</P>
<P>
At the international level, Hammer was unpopular with many career diplomats who 
served over the years in the American Embassy in Moscow. Some viewed him as an 
apologist for the Soviets, and virtually all were bitter over the fact that he 
had access to Kremlin leaders while they did not. 
</P>
<P>
It was like rubbing salt in their wounded professional pride when those same 
diplomats had to interview Hammer after one of his private sessions with the 
Soviet leadership in order to file the mandatory cable to Washington on the 
discussions. "What a way to conduct foreign policy!" one high ranking American 
diplomat fumed after one such session, the post-Afghanistan invasion meeting 
between Hammer and Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
Although a lower profile might have ameliorated some of the criticism that had 
dogged Hammer's tracks, he appeared unable to resist the limelight. No matter 
how often the story of his life was recounted, for example, he relished telling 
it again. In speeches he would recite repeatedly, "Overnight I became a hero to 
the Russian people." 
</P>
<P>
And the Occidental public relations department had to continually churn out 
flattering news about "Doctor," as he was called at Westwood headquarters. 
Explained one former executive, "Hammer felt he had done unusual and important 
things in his life, and believed he should be credited with them." 
</P>
<P>
Among those things were Hammer's philanthropy in cancer research and education. 
</P>
<P>
A board member of the Eleanor Roosevelt Cancer Foundation since 1960, Hammer 
established a cancer biology research center at the Salk Institute in La Jolla 
in 1970 with a grant of $5 million. He also endowed his alma mater, Columbia 
University, with $5 million for medical research by establishing the Julius and 
Armand Hammer Health Sciences Center. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer, a long-time patron of the arts, also had committed to donate his vast 
art collection to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The treasures included 
"Five Centuries of Art," Hammer's collection of European masterpieces by 
renowned artists including Rembrandt, Rubens, Renoir and Goya; a collection of 
hundreds of works by Honore Daumier and the so-called Codex Hammer, a book of 
sketches by Leonardo da Vinci. 
</P>
<P>
But Hammer abruptly withdrew his commitment in 1987 after the museum balked at 
a series of his demands. Among them: that names of other donors who gave money 
for galleries where his paintings would be displayed be stripped from the 
spaces and that life-sized portraits of Hammer and his wife be permanently 
displayed with his art collection. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer then announced plans to build the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and 
Cultural Center behind the Occidental Petroleum headquarters in Westwood. The 
museum was buffeted by major cost overruns and criticized for the limited scope 
of its collection, one that would have fitted in well into another museum but 
was not extensive enough to stand on its own. 
</P>
<P>
The project also precipitated lawsuits from Occidental shareholders, who 
contend that company funds have been improperly used to assemble Hammer's art 
collection and build the museum. 
</P>
<P>
In a legal deposition taken last June, Hammer said, "There is no telling what 
it (the art collection) is worth. It's probably priceless . . . I am 
continually adding to the collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I have only two things in life left," he continued. "One, I've been 
instrumental in trying to bring peace between the East and the West, and I've 
been thanked by presidents for what I've done in helping to bring (this) about. 
Another thing that's left is the museum, which is most important to me now." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times in 1980, Hammer was asked if he had ever 
experienced failure. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I have ever failed," he replied. "I always think of the worst 
thing that can happen. Then I take precautions to see it doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
An associate of Hammer once observed, "All the things Hammer's done, the 
gambles he's taken, show daring. People with daring are usually self confident, 
because you don't take a dare unless you think you have more than a 50% chance 
of winning." He added, "When Hammer focuses on something, he never gives up. I 
have never seen such a combination of physical and psychological resources 
mustered in one man. He has not wasted one minute of the time God gave him." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer was married three times and leaves a son, Julian, who lives in Los 
Angeles, by his first wife. His wife since 1954, Frances Tolman, traveled 
everywhere with him prior to her death in December, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<P>
Jesse B. Semple -- "Simple" to his friends -- lived in Harlem, where he often 
shared with his friend Boyd his wry, homespun observations on the pains and 
frustrations of life in a racist society. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time colored folks is front page news," Semple once said, "is when 
there's been a lynching or a boycott or a whole bunch of us have been butchered 
or is arrested." 
</P>
<P>
Writer Langston Hughes created the fictional character of "Simple" 48 years 
ago. But there was nothing fictional about Simple's commentary on the American 
press, and despite substantial improvement in recent years, many journalists of 
all colors offer disquietingly similar criticisms of their profession today. 
</P>
<P>
Overt racism in the press is rare now, and some newspapers -- most notably USA 
Today, others in the Gannett and Knight-Ridder chains and the Seattle Times -- 
have even tried as a matter of formal policy to include people of color in the 
mainstream of their daily coverage. But minority journalists (and many of their 
white colleagues and supervisors) say the overwhelming majority of press 
coverage still emphasizes the pathology of minority behavior -- drugs, gangs, 
crime, violence, poverty, illiteracy -- almost to the exclusion of normal, 
everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, of course, the same criticism can be made of press coverage of 
whites. News, as defined by the people who write, edit, publish and broadcast 
it, is about the unusual, the aberrant -- about triumphs and tragedies, 
underachievers and overachievers; it's about the extremes of life, not "normal, 
everyday" life. 
</P>
<P>
But the press covers a much broader range of white life than of minority life, 
and critics say the narrow, distorted view of ethnic minorities presented in 
the press strongly influences how whites -- and such white-run institutions as 
the police, the courts and the school system -- perceive and treat minorities. 
The press thus plays a major role in perpetuating the ethnic stereotypes -- and 
fueling the prejudices and ethnic conflicts -- that increasingly polarize our 
increasingly multicultural society. 
</P>
<P>
Times interviews with more than 175 reporters, editors and publishers from more 
than 30 newspapers nationwide over the past four months produced a wide range 
of criticisms of how the press portrays African-Americans, Latinos, 
Asian-Americans and Native Americans. Among these were: Harmful stereotyping. 
Ignorance of cultural differences. Use of racially biased or insensitive 
language. Unfair comparisons between different ethnic groups. A double standard 
in the coverage of minority politicians. Failure to photograph or quote 
minorities. Anointing unrepresentative and sometimes irresponsible minority 
"spokesmen." Automatically lumping together all Latinos or, in particular, all 
Asian-Americans as a single community, without recognizing the substantial 
differences in culture and language among the varied elements of those 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
But no complaint about press coverage was voiced as frequently by minorities 
(or acknowledged as readily by many whites) as the overwhelmingly negative 
nature of most stories on people of color -- especially blacks and Latinos -- 
and the concomitant absence of people of color from the mainstream of daily 
news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TV News 
</P>
<P>
Although local television news (with its emphasis on crime and violence) and 
network news (with its emphasis on public policy) are especially susceptible to 
these charges, most newspapers aren't much better, the critics say. And yet, 
only by covering all aspects of minority life can the press give whites a 
"rounded picture" of society -- and give minorities themselves a sense of 
belonging to that society, says A. Stephen Montiel, a Latino, who is president 
of the Institute for Journalism Education in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, newspapers do provide this "rounded picture" by including 
minorities in their mainstream coverage. USA Today quoted and pictured blacks 
in a routine story in August on doctor-patient relations. The Seattle Times 
quoted and pictured an Asian-American couple in a September story on a slowdown 
in the Seattle housing market. The Miami Herald included Hispanics in a story 
on Christmas shopping -- and illustrated the story with a drawing that showed 
people of varying ethnic backgrounds. But these are exceptions. As far as the 
press is concerned, "We don't exist" in the mainstream of life in this country, 
says Craig Matsuda, assistant View section editor at the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if all one knew about real-life blacks and Latinos in particular was 
what one read in the newspaper or saw on television news -- and in our still 
largely segregated society, that's where most whites do get most of their 
information about blacks and Latinos -- one would scarcely be aware that there 
is a large and growing middle class in both cultures, going to work, getting 
married, having children, paying taxes, going on vacation and buying books and 
VCRs and microwave ovens. 
</P>
<P>
Only 15% of the poor people in the United States are black, but one would not 
know that from most press coverage. Nor would one know that most violent 
criminals, drug-users, prostitutes, drunks, illiterates, high school dropouts, 
juvenile delinquents, jobless and poor people in this country are neither black 
nor Latino but white. Or that the vast majority of blacks and Latinos are none 
of the above. 
</P>
<P>
Despite vigorous efforts, even the Detroit Free Press -- with several 
high-ranking black editors and a city population that's more than 70% black -- 
doesn't do as good a job as it should covering blacks as "normal, everyday 
human beings," concedes the paper's white publisher, Neal Shine. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, while the paper's lifestyle section is officially called "The Way We 
Live," many blacks call it "The Way They Live." 
</P>
<P>
The Free Press has a much better reputation than most for covering blacks, but, 
"When I'm out in the community covering something, and folks say, 'Well, you 
work for a racist paper,' it's hard for me to defend" the paper, says Constance 
Prater, chief of the city-county bureau for the Free Press and president of the 
Detroit chapter of the National Assn. of Black Journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks at other papers make almost identical comments about their communities 
and their papers. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks are the largest minority group in the United States, and they have 
generally been the victims of the worst bigotry here -- enslaved, lynched, once 
officially classified by the U.S. Supreme Court as non-citizens -- so it's not 
surprising that when the press thinks of minorities at all, there's a "historic 
tendency" to think almost exclusively of blacks, in the words of Leonard 
Downie, a white, who is managing editor of the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, a New York Times "American Voices" story last month, based on interviews 
nationwide about the crisis in the Persian Gulf, included a photograph of seven 
whites and one black but no photos of any other minorities. The story included 
interviews with 20 "Americans . . . of all walks of life;" not one had an 
identifiably Latino or Asian-American surname. 
</P>
<P>
That same day, a joint study by the National Commission on Working Women and 
Women in Film showed that there are about five times as many black characters 
as Latino, Asian-American and Native American characters combined in prime-time 
television. The study said there are as many extraterrestrial aliens in 
prime-time television as there are Latinos and Asian-Americans combined. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time," says Gerald Garcia, publisher of the Knoxville Journal in 
Tennessee, "the only minority group that anyone (in the press) . . . had any 
conscious level about were blacks." 
</P>
<P>
There is some evidence that this is changing, however slowly -- especially in 
cities like Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco and in the Southwest, 
where there are large and rapidly growing Latino and/or Asian-American 
populations. But the largely negative press portrayals of blacks and Latinos 
may be changing even more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
No minority journalist interviewed for this story suggested that these negative 
portrayals -- or the absence of minorities from mainstream press coverage -- 
are the product of a conscious, racist decision by white editors and reporters. 
In fact, even the most caustic critics of the press acknowledge that most white 
journalists mean well; it's not the intent but the results that trigger 
widespread criticism -- and those results stem largely from ignorance, 
insensitivity, the absence of minority journalists from most newsrooms and, 
more important, the absence of minorities from most editors' offices (which 
will be the subject of Thursday's story in this series). 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much some overt racist plot," says Janet Clayton, a black, who is 
assistant editorial page editor of the Los Angeles Times. "It has to do with, 
obviously, who runs newspapers . . . what the values are of those people, the 
world that they live in. We all bring to the table what . . . our life 
experience is." 
</P>
<P>
Journalists who have had little exposure to minorities or who have known them 
only in certain roles tend not to include them in their "everyday thinking," 
Clayton says, and "if they're not there in your mind, then they tend not be 
part of your natural news-gathering process." 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers routinely publish engagement notices ("all of them white"), 
obituaries ("all of them white") and stories on young, middle-class couples 
struggling to buy their first homes ("all of them white"), says Ben Johnson, a 
black, who is assistant managing editor of the St. Petersburg Times in Florida. 
This coverage of white America, Johnson says, gives readers "some sense of 
normalcy." 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, that same coverage also gives the impression that "people of 
color don't buy houses . . . die . . . get married." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson concedes that he may be exaggerating a bit in this characterization of 
press coverage, but he and others insist that the general, if unwitting message 
of the white press is that non-white people don't do these "normal" things, 
don't lead normal lives. 
</P>
<P>
A few newspapers have recently begun trying to correct this imbalance, actively 
urging social organizations, funeral homes and others in minority communities 
to send them newsworthy information. But such requests are still relatively 
rare. The result: Coverage of minorites continues to be skewed to the negative 
and the sensational. 
</P>
<P>
The double standard implicit in such coverage is not nearly as blatant as it 
once was. After all, in our own generation newspapers still routinely 
identified black crime suspects (but not white crime suspects) by race. Most 
responsible papers now do that only if it is relevant, and even then they often 
agonize over it -- as the New York Times did this year in making discussion of 
that subject the lead item in three issues of "Winners &amp; Sinners," its 
in-house critique of Times coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion was triggered by the failure of the Times to include a racial 
description of a suspect in a shooting. Mentioning race in a skimpy description 
-- "black male" -- would be unfair, but since the paper had identified the 
suspect as "an unkempt man in his early 30's, about 6 feet tall and 180 pounds, 
with a moustache and beard," the question was raised, "Can we justify leaving 
out an element that narrows the field by a huge fraction? The omission itself, 
however kindly meant, might well seem patronizing -- as if we assume that a 
whole segment of the human race should feel stigmatized because one of its 
number committed a crime." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crime Suspects 
</P>
<P>
Careful consideration of the racial identification of criminal suspects is but 
one example of how the media has changed of late. As recently as the late 1960s 
-- and probably the 1970s in many cities -- virtually any reporter covering the 
police beat knew that if there was a murder in the ghetto or barrio, editors 
would automatically dismiss it as unworthy of publication -- a "misdemeanor 
homicide" in their lexicon. Now the most enlightened editors struggle to decide 
which is the worst journalistic sin -- publishing a story on a minority murder 
and contributing to the stereotype of minority communities as violence-prone or 
not publishing such a story and contributing to the perception that they regard 
minority lives as worth less than white lives. 
</P>
<P>
But the perception remains that white editors value white lives more highly 
than minority lives, that "black-on-black violence is not much of an issue 
until whites are involved," in the words of Bill Sing, an Asian-American who is 
an assistant business editor at the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
This may help explain why most violent crimes in which blacks are the victims 
still receive far less press attention than do cases in which whites are the 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
The press swarmed all over the rape and beating of a white woman jogging in 
Central Park last year; even the Los Angeles Times, 2,500 miles away, put the 
story on Page 1 six times. The murder of a Utah tourist in a New York subway 
station this year also received massive press attention. 
</P>
<P>
But two days after the rape in Central Park, a black, off-duty mailman was 
gunned down in Harlem; about a week later, a black woman, the mother of four, 
was raped and sodomized at knifepoint, then hurled from the roof of a building, 
down an open air shaft, three stories to the ground, suffering severe injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of these stories generally received more than passing notice in the 
news columns of New York's daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Journalist Critics 
</P>
<P>
Minority journalists who criticize the press say they are not asking for 
special treatment -- for a kinder, gentler journalism -- only for a more 
comprehensive and comprehending journalism. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the last person in the world who will ever say that the Free Press can or 
should ignore the negative," says Jacqueline Thomas, associate editor and 
deputy editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
Some problems may even have been ignored by the paper for too long, she says. 
</P>
<P>
But Thomas, a black, seems uncomfortable with the current boycott of the Free 
Press by a relatively small group of blacks angry over its "negative" coverage 
of the city and Mayor Coleman Young, a black. 
</P>
<P>
Some black anger is "justified," Thomas says, because, "We don't do a good 
enough job in reflecting those things that make Detroit a place some of us want 
to live in." Thomas says she has "no doubt," however, that much of the 
criticism of the paper stems from "a fundamental misunderstanding about what 
our role is." 
</P>
<P>
Some blacks want the paper to be "supportive of black leadership," she says, 
but "I didn't become a journalist to become a cheerleader for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Hiawatha Bray, a black reporter at the Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky, 
says much the same thing. But he also says blacks must share responsibility for 
the negative coverage they receive. 
</P>
<P>
"I get worried and very annoyed that black people would rather sit around 
complaining about how terrible the media is than saying, 'Well, gee, maybe we 
better stop our kids from participating in drive-by shootings,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks and Latinos do commit a disproportionate share of the nation's crimes 
and are present in disproportionate numbers on many other indices of social 
pathology. Minority journalists who criticize the press don't deny these bleak 
statistics, but they point out that much of this pathological behavior stems in 
large measure from historic patterns of discrimination, segregation and 
exclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, pathology is only part of the story, and yet that's what gets the 
emphasis in the press. 
</P>
<P>
Most press coverage of minorities in a positive context involves an even 
narrower range of activity -- sports and entertainment, says John Funabiki, 
director of the Center for Integration and Improvement of Journalism, based at 
San Francisco State University. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, says Felix Gutierrez, vice president of the Gannett Foundation, 
minority coverage "too often . . . still falls into the predictable categories 
. . . We're either beset by problems . . . or we're causing problems for the 
white society . . . The other category of coverage where we're defined as a 
people are the 'zoo stories' -- Chinese New Year, Cinco de Mayo, black history 
month -- basically where they come out and see us in our cultural garb . . . 
out of the context of our normal daily living." 
</P>
<P>
Covering those stories would be perfectly appropriate, minority journalists 
say, if their "normal," middle-class existence were covered too. 
</P>
<P>
But the press "doesn't cover middle-class people, period," says Milton Coleman, 
assistant managing editor in charge of local news coverage at the Washington 
Post. "Most of us in this newsroom are middle-class; in so many ways, the lives 
we lead outside the newsroom are rarely covered in the pages of the newspaper 
because we tend to lean more toward covering policy . . . poverty . . . foreign 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're slow, for instance, to get on to covering day care as an issue even 
though after 3 o'clock or 3:30, the phones in this newsroom ring off the hook 
-- and it's not sources, it's kids calling their parents." 
</P>
<P>
But the problem is "more acute" in minority communities, particularly black 
communities, says Coleman, who's black. 
</P>
<P>
"In this town, so much of what we would generally regard as news -- the bad 
things -- happen to be about blacks," he says. "But a lot of the other news 
that often gets into the paper about the mainstream or hotsy-totsy people -- 
there aren't a lot of blacks, sometimes, in that news. 
</P>
<P>
"The national news world is a very white world in a lot of ways," Coleman says. 
</P>
<P>
Whites still occupy most of the powerful and visible positions in our society 
-- President, governor, senator, cabinet member, district attorney, Wall Street 
tycoon, corporate board chairman, network executive, movie mogul, newspaper 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the big news that the press covers is still made by whites," Coleman 
says. "If one reads the news pages . . . and tries to get a sense of the 
community, you get a distorted sense of the black community." 
</P>
<P>
Similar distortions are evident in coverage of other minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, while African-Americans and Latinos object to the preponderantly 
negative coverage the press give them, Asian-Americans object mostly to 
coverage that depicts them as a "model minority," largely devoid of the 
problems besetting other minorities. But some Asian-Americans also share their 
fellow minorities' complaint that the press sensationalizes much of what it 
covers in minority communities -- the conflict between Korean greengrocers and 
black customers in several cities being a prime example. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say the press may occasionally try to overcompensate for its 
essentially negative portrayal of blacks and Latinos by being too soft on 
prominent members of those ethnic groups who deserve critical scrutiny. Both 
the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times came in for that criticism in 
their early coverage of Mayors Marion Barry and Tom Bradley, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
But many minorities say the white press has occasionally been too tough on 
minority politicians, holding them to a stricter standard than white 
politicians. Some minorities argue that there's a conspiracy in the white 
establishment -- the press included -- to discredit prominent black 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Conspiracy, double standard or not, complaints about the misportrayal of 
minorities in general and the resultant, pervasive public misperception of them 
is not a simple matter of sensitivity over ethnic image -- or of academic 
journalistic criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The portrayal of many minorities in the press creates a misleading and 
destructive public impression -- even more destructive, in many ways, than that 
cited in 1968 by the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (popularly 
known as the Kerner Commission). 
</P>
<P>
"By failing to portray the Negro as a matter of routine and in the context of 
the total society, the news media have, we believe, contributed to the 
black-white schism in this country," the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
"If what the white American reads in the newspapers or sees on television 
conditions his expectation of what is ordinary and normal in the larger 
society, he will neither understand nor accept the black American." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as Marilyn Gist of the University of Washington asks in a study on the 
negative portrayal of minorities in the press, "To what extent do biased 
journalistic practices contribute to police practices in the war on drugs or 
gangs . . . . To what extent are the higher rates of incarceration among 
African-Americans a function of subtle racism among judges and juries -- racism 
perpetuated by media bias?" 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in Boston, Charles Stuart told police that a black man had murdered 
his pregnant wife and shot him. The media jumped on the story, largley ignoring 
striking inconsistencies in Stuart's story, and publicly identified several 
black suspects taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
Police conducted a massive, invasive search of black neighborhoods and then let 
it be known that they thought they had a strong case against one of the 
suspects. A Massachussets state senator later said, "I'm positive that (the 
suspect) . . . would have been charged, convicted and sent to prison for the 
rest of his natural life" had it not been for one slight hitch: Ten weeks after 
Stuart's wife was murdered, Stuart apparently leaped to his death from a bridge 
over Boston Harbor after learning that he had become the prime suspect in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Media Blamed 
</P>
<P>
Although Boston editors vigorously defend their coverage of the Stuart case, 
many others were critical of it and blamed the media -- in that specific case 
and in general minority coverage over the years -- for having contributed to a 
climate in which police and public alike automatically assumed the guilt of a 
black man in the murder of a white. 
</P>
<P>
"The Boston media, including good television stations and a good newspaper, 
allowed themselves to be duped by stereotypes of who crime victims and 
perpetrators are," says Tom Morgan, a reporter for the New York Times and 
president of the National Assn. of Black Journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a continuing pattern throughout the country," Morgan says. "The media 
are too quick to jump to negative conclusions when it comes to minorities." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the press is quick to jump to negative conclusions when it comes to 
almost everyone, as virtually every politician of any color would be quick to 
point out. Hence former Vice President Spiro Agnew's characterization of the 
press as "nattering nabobs of negativism," an epithet not noticeably inspired 
by an abiding sympathy for the plight of the disadvantaged in our society. 
</P>
<P>
But Les Payne, assistant managing editor of Newsday in New York, says media 
stereotyping of minorities -- especially young black males -- contributes 
significantly to the way society treats them, especially in the criminal 
justice system and on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Whites who killed 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins in the Bensonhurst section of 
Brooklyn last year noticed only one thing about their target -- "he was black," 
Payne says. 
</P>
<P>
"He could have been Jamal Payne -- my son." 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the seven men ultimately charged in the slaying of Hawkins was held 
without bail as soon as he was arrested, much as the white defendants in 
another widely publicized murder of a black in New York -- the Howard Beach 
case -- were allowed to remain free on bail, even after they were convicted, 
pending their appeal. But in the Central Park jogger case, all eight black 
defendants were denied bail at their arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Media stereotypes must share the blame for this inequity, Payne and others say. 
</P>
<P>
The media's portrayal of minorities may affect minorities' perceptions of 
themselves in a way that may be equally damaging. 
</P>
<P>
Most people's self-image derives in part from how they see themselves portrayed 
in the press, and the negative portrayal of many minorities by the press may be 
psychologically destructive, Gist says, in transmitting "strong signals . . . 
to developing minority youth about what they can (and cannot) become." 
</P>
<P>
As David Lawrence, the white publisher of the Miami Herald puts it, "If we show 
readers only white folks as bankers . . . or chefs, no wonder minorities grow 
up thinking they can't be those things." 
</P>
<P>
The frustrations and failures engendered by these press messages may help 
explain not only the pathology of some minority behavior but the resultant 
racial tensions that are growing in many segments of our ever more pluralistic 
society. 
</P>
<P>
The most notorious racial incidents in recent years -- the Central Park jogger 
case, Bensonhurst, Howard Beach, Tawana Brawley, the black boycott of Korean 
grocers -- all seem to have happened in New York. That's because the national 
media are headquartered in New York. But there have been equally volatile 
instances of racial conflict in virtually every major American city, and unless 
significant progress is made toward multicultural understanding and tolerance, 
critics say the conflict seems likely to increase as minority populations 
continue to increase. 
</P>
<P>
Minorities now make up about 25% of the nation's population, and the number is 
climbing rapidly; since 1980, the percentage of blacks in the population has 
grown at twice the rate of whites, the percentage of Latinos has grown at 
almost six times the rate of whites and the percentage of Asian-Americans has 
grown at more than 10 times the rate of whites. Over the next decade, 87% of 
the nation's population growth will be among minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Minorities" are already a majority in such major cities as New York, Chicago, 
Washington, Detroit, Cleveland, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
That's one reason why there are now more than 250 black, Spanish-language and 
various Asian-language newspapers published in the United States -- most of 
them providing, among other things, just the kind of mainstream and generally 
upbeat coverage of their communities that the white press eschews. 
</P>
<P>
Many minority journalists see this inexorable growth of minority population as 
the ultimate answer to the problem of indifferent or insensitive press 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s and early 1970s, they say, minorities -- and some enlightened 
whites -- urged the press to give more (and more evenhanded) coverage to 
minorities because such coverage was the morally and ethically correct thing to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
With a few notable exceptions, not much really changed. 
</P>
<P>
Then a new argument was mounted, not a moral argument but a journalistic 
argument: Better minority coverage would make for better -- i.e., more 
complete, more sensitive and more diverse newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Again, with a few notable exceptions, not much really changed. 
</P>
<P>
But now, newspaper readership is declining and minority population is 
increasing, and the advocates of pluralism in the news columns are mounting a 
financial argument: Cover minorities better because they're not going to be in 
the minority much longer, and if you don't cover them, they won't read your 
papers or patronize your advertisers and you're going to be out of business, 
scratching your bald head, wondering what you did wrong. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a new argument, but the new realities of the marketplace have 
persuaded more publishers and top editors to listen to it this time. 
</P>
<P>
When the argument was first made, in the mid-1970s, newspapers were "fascinated 
with upscale readers" and blinded by the stereotype that said minority readers 
didn't read or buy, says Jay Harris, a black, who is vice president of 
operations for Knight-Ridder newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Charles Erickson tried to persuade the publisher of a 
newspaper in a heavily Latino market to subscribe to his Hispanic Link News 
Service, which provides news and commentary on Latino issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people wouldn't buy it," the publisher told Erickson. "They're all 
illiterate." 
</P>
<P>
Another publisher, Otis Chandler of the Los Angeles Times -- now chairman of 
the executive committee of the Times Mirror Board of Directors -- stirred 
considerable controversy in 1978 when he said in an interview that the black 
and Latino markets didn't have the purchasing power that Times advertisers 
required and, further, that it was difficult to get those groups to read the 
paper because "it's not their kind of newspaper. It's too big, it's too stuffy 
-- if you will, it's too complicated." 
</P>
<P>
Chandler concedes he "shouldn't have used the word . . . 'complicated,' " but 
he says he was "agonizing over the paper's inadequate coverage of minorities 
and was groping for explanations." He says he did not mean to imply that 
"blacks and Latinos are not smart enough to read The Times." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Frank del Olmo, deputy editorial page editor of The Times, says 
he still hears complaints in the Latino community about Chandler's remarks and, 
as Joyce Sherwood and Peter Johnson of The Times editorial library assisted 
with the research for this series. 
</P>
<P>
Harris says, until relatively recently, most newspapers did think that low 
education levels and/or language barriers rendered most minorities unlikely 
readers -- and unlikely consumers for their advertisers. So little effort was 
made to cover them as news subjects -- except when their deeds (say, as 
athletes) or misdeeds (say, as gang members) made them unavoidably "newsworthy" 
by the standard, white journalist's definition of that term. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a dirty little secret in all newspapers -- the advertisers we cater to 
are not thrilled when you sign up a bunch of readers in some poverty area for 
home delivery," says Joseph Lelyveld, managing editor of the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
Lelyveld, a white, says he doesn't know if that attitude "seeped into the 
newsroom," but he leaves the impression that it is a distinct possibility, 
particularly from the late 1970s into the early and mid-1980s. "There was a 
time when this paper could have been accused of abandoning certain kinds of 
readers," he says. "We had bumpy times . . . in which it seems to me there was 
a kind of weariness with poverty issues, city issues. We didn't seem 
particulary committed to coverage of minorities, especially in our own . . . 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to give more coverage to Zimbabwe than the Bronx." 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights movement and urban riots of the 1960s sparked widespread 
journalistic concern about minority coverage -- coverage of blacks in 
particular -- that led to a greater sensitivity and commitment which lasted 
into the 1970s. But during the Reagan/Bush years, a corporate, bottom-line 
mentality began to take hold at even the best of newspapers, and the revolution 
"lost its edge," in the words of Ernest Holsendolph, a black, who is about to 
begin writing a business column at the Atlanta Journal and Constitution after 
serving as city editor of the paper for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Even when minorities are covered, they are often covered strictly as 
minorities, not as part of the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
William H. Gray III (D.-Pa.), majority whip of the U.S. House of 
Representatives, has long been praised by the press for his political skills 
and his grasp of a wide variety of issues, but he, too, was "ghettoized" in 
this fashion. Most stories on Gray in the New York Times, Washington Post and 
Philadelphia Inquirer early in his congressional career involved black politics 
or South Africa, according to a study by Linda Williams of the Joan Shorenstein 
Barone Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, his views were not deemed newsworthy when the subject was not 
blacks," Williams concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Gray's race was often noted in articles that "had nothing to do with 
the subject of race (especially articles on the budget process) . . . . Gray 
was so often referred to as the 'black Budget Committee Chairman' that a 
(foreign visitor) . . . might well have wondered if the U.S. House of 
Representatives had a white budget chairman and a black budget chairman," 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post and Chicago Tribune have all 
referred to August Wilson as a "black playwright;" The Times called him "one of 
the nation's leading black playwrights." But after winning two Pulitzer Prizes, 
hasn't Wilson earned the right to be called "one of the nation's leading 
playwrights," period? After all, no one writes of David Mamet as "one of the 
nation's leading white playwrights." Doesn't describing Wilson as (merely) a 
"black playwright" implicitly diminish his achievement? 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Duke, a Washington Post reporter recently assigned to write about race as 
a regular beat, says this "labeling" makes blacks "appear to be not part of the 
broader society but a special-interest group." 
</P>
<P>
"The label 'black politician,' 'black writer,' 'black activist' . . . tends 
automatically to separate that writer, that politician, that activist from the 
purview of mainstream concerns and makes it a smaller, separate and therefore 
not as important an issue for the society at-large. . . ."

FDA APPROVES 5-YEAR FEMALE CONTRACEPTIVE 
</P>

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration on Monday announced the approval of a new 
contraceptive for women that prevents pregnancy for up to five years. It offers 
the first real alternative to barrier contraception since the introduction of 
the pill and the intrauterine device several decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike barrier contraceptives such as the condom or diaphragm, Norplant 
consists of a fan-like arrangement of six silicone rubber capsules the diameter 
of matchsticks, but shorter, that are inserted beneath the skin of a woman's 
inner arm, just above the elbow. They slowly release levonorgestrel, a 
progesterone-like hormone that is an active ingredient in some oral 
contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
Norplant is inserted in a physician's office under a local anesthetic in a 
procedure that takes about 15 minutes. Fertility is restored when the rods are 
removed, the FDA said. The tiny rods are not visible but can be felt underneath 
the skin. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important advance which will be extraordinarily useful both in 
the United States and abroad," said Dr. J. Joseph Speidel, president of the 
Population Crisis Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's highly effective, lasts a long time, is reversible and doesn't need any 
particular action on the part of the user -- it's something you can do once and 
forget," he added. "Every time a new method is introduced, both domestic and 
overseas, it appeals to some potential users, so the overall total use of birth 
control increases. When you have more options, more people will find at least 
one method that is acceptable and useful for them." 
</P>
<P>
The Population Crisis Committee described the method as "very effective," with 
less than one pregnancy for each 100 users each year. 
</P>
<P>
Norplant was developed by the nonprofit Population Council and will be marketed 
by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of Philadelphia. It will be available in February, 
a company spokesman said. The contraceptive is believed to work by inhibiting 
ovulation and thickening a women's cervical mucus, which in turn blocks the 
passage of sperm into the uterus. 
</P>
<P>
"This crowns an international scientific collaboration that spans more than 20 
years of work in about 46 countries," said George Zeidenstein, president of the 
Population Council. "As far as contraceptive development is concerned, we're 
really in the business of options. This is a very important option that is now 
going to be available to people in America." 
</P>
<P>
Norplant is already approved for use in 16 countries, including Finland, 
Sweden, Indonesia, the Dominican Republic and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Studies involving 55,000 women have been conducted in 44 countries, according 
to the Population Crisis Committee. There are 200,000 users in Indonesia alone, 
the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
The first laboratory studies of the product began in 1966 and the earliest 
studies in humans began in 1968, according to the FDA. A multicenter study of 
more than 2,400 women was conducted at sites that included Los Angeles, San 
Francisco and New Brunswick, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very safe and extremely effective," said Dr. Daniel Mishell, chairman of 
the department of obstetrics and gynecology at USC, one of the centers where 
human studies were conducted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not perfect and it's not for everybody," he added, listing the product's 
minor inconveniences: "It takes a while to get it inserted. It involves an 
incision. You wear a bandage and you're a little black and blue for a few days. 
And removing it takes a little bit of skill." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, for many women -- once the process is explained to them -- "you 
put it in their arm and they really like it." 
</P>
<P>
Its major side effect is a tendency to cause irregular menstrual bleeding, the 
most frequent reason users have given when they have had the capsules removed. 
Other reported side effects include occasional headaches, mood changes, nausea 
and an increase in acne. 
</P>
<P>
Mishell described most of the side effects as "mild." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Norplant does not contain estrogen, the hormone believed responsible 
for the most dangerous potential side effects of oral contraceptives, such as 
heart attacks and strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the FDA said that -- as with oral contraceptives -- women with 
acute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood clots 
in the legs, lungs or eyes should not use the product. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said that Norplant has proved more effective in women weighing less 
than 150 pounds and that its effectiveness could decrease in heavier women. 
</P>
<P>
But Mishell said that the agency's conclusion was based on earlier versions of 
the capsules which were thicker and which resulted in more dilution by the 
steroid in body fat before it entered the bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
"With the tubing being used now, blood levels (of the drug) are now higher and 
there does not seem to be a differential related to weight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear Monday what Norplant would cost. Representatives from the 
company could not be reached. But Zeidenstein, of the Population Council, said 
he anticipates that "the price will compare very favorably with the U.S. price 
of oral contraceptives."

OTHER OFFICERS SEE VERDICT AS SAD BUT JUST CONCLUSION

For cops at the front lines of the drug wars, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department money-skimming scandal set off mixed emotions from the start. 
</P>
<P>
At some level, they could not help but hope the case would vanish. "In the 
ranks they're still like brothers," noted Sgt. Ralph Freeze, who heads the drug 
squad at the Bell-Cudahy Police Department. "They were police officers and they 
had a lot of time in. . . . It's affected their family, loved ones and friends. 
. . . You hate to see it." 
</P>
<P>
After the convictions on Monday, however, Freeze and others also were 
recounting the toll from the case -- which tarnished the once-glittering 
reputation of California law enforcement, prompted some departments to retrench 
their drug-fighting efforts and led others to institute new controls over the 
handling of money. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little naive," concluded Sgt. Dale Schirman, a supervisor in the 
sheriff's narcotics administrative unit. "A fellow policeman could do no 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"I think most police officers have a certain ambivalence here," said Lt. Mike 
Post, who supervises the Glendale drug unit, among the most active in the 
region. "But there aren't too many cops at any level who won't tell you if a 
cop's dirty, he has to fall." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with the jury having spoken, even veteran deputies at the sheriff's 
training center in Whittier were no longer closing ranks around colleagues in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're guilty," said one, "they had it coming." 
</P>
<P>
But around the sprawling campus of the Sheriff's Training Academy and Regional 
Service Center, they also searched for some positive value in the seven 
convictions. One deputy found it in the sight of new recruits, still dressed in 
their civilian suits, being put through marching drills on a parking lot under 
a warm afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a classroom example," he said. "This is an absolute deterrent" to 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Until the sheriff's scandal, specialized squads targeting "major" narcotics 
violators seemed to be one of the unqualified success stories of Southern 
California law enforcement. One department after another formed such units 
following passage of the federal Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, which 
allowed law enforcement agencies to keep up to 90% of the assets they seized. 
Soon the total cash confiscated yearly from drug dealers in the region rose 
above $100 million -- more than anywhere else in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Cash seizures by the Sheriff's Department alone jumped from $2.8 million in 
1984 to $33.9 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Squads from mid-sized cities such as Glendale, Simi Valley and Torrance also 
roamed well beyond their municipal borders to make splashy busts, in the 
process financing the purchase of new helicopters and computer systems for 
their departments. 
</P>
<P>
When allegations surfaced last year that members of the sheriff's units may 
have been pocketing a large chunk of the cash they seized, the reverberations 
were felt throughout the law enforcement community. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very traumatic," said Capt. Jim Oman, whose Brea drug task force 
used to back up the sheriff's teams several times a week. 
</P>
<P>
After the first group of deputies was suspended from duty, Oman reported that 
officials in his own Orange County department "had several sessions where we 
brainstormed," then decided on a somewhat less-ambitious drug-fighting 
strategy. "We're probably doing cases that are more related to our geographic 
boundaries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have day-to-day contact (with the L.A. County sheriff's squads) 
anymore," Oman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Like other drug-fighting officers, he said he sympathized with the deputies 
when they went to trial. Even so, "as time went by, the evidence seemed to 
indicate there had been irregularities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Much like the jurors in the case, Oman found it hard to swallow the deputies' 
explanations that they accumulated tens of thousands of dollars in cash by 
gambling, refurbishing cars and through wives' jobs baby-sitting and working in 
a beauty parlor. 
</P>
<P>
"If one person had come up with a story like that . . . but a whole group? It 
just was kind of unbelievable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real sorry that it happened . . . I hope that justice was done," Oman 
said. "It's too bad for all law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's Post said the case created "a heightened sense of awareness" in 
drug-fighting circles, "that the possibility of police corruption is not 
something left over from our history of decades ago. . . . It's an issue that 
has to be constantly monitored." 
</P>
<P>
In his own unit, "there have been some tightening of existing procedures," Post 
said, including a requirement that a supervisor immediately report the 
estimated amount of cash found in a raid. In addition, there are rules for 
quickly locking the cash in tamper-proof bags so that "even the chief of 
police" could not remove it at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Schirman, who helps oversee 189 employees with drug-fighting assignments, 
including 120 sworn deputies, said there now is "a little more supervision" at 
every step of the seizure process, from serving search warrants to logging in 
and transporting drugs and cash. 
</P>
<P>
But he and others noted that the skimming scandal, while illustrating the need 
for stringent regulations, also demonstrated their limits. One of the key 
pieces of prosecution evidence was a secret videotape of deputies putting aside 
wads of cash before placing the rest in the official packages. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never remove the human element from the equation," Post said.

ON CALIFORNIA: A DEADLY GAME IN THE FAST LANE 
</P>

Official records are not precise on this point, but I am confident the 
following statement is true: California freeways just north of the Mexican 
border slaughter more human beings each year than any equivalent stretch of 
interstate in the nation. These freeways mow down people like Texas freeways 
mow down armadillos. 
</P>
<P>
The humans getting killed, of course, are not "us." They're Mexicans, 
Salvadorans, Ecuadoreans and all manner of illegal what-have-yous from the 
south. They slip across the border, usually at dusk, and soon find themselves 
confronted with eight lanes of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
This may be I-5, or I-805, or I-905. All three crisscross the border region in 
one direction or another. It is a bewildering complex, full of surprises. If 
the illegals pop up at one spot on I-5 they will see a large, official sign on 
the median strip that says, "Bienvenidos a California." This sign may or may 
not be a joke. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the freeways amount to physical barriers to our new arrivals, 
separating them from everything they need. On the other side is civilization, 
their rides north, places to hide. So cross the freeways they must. 
</P>
<P>
And that's when the slaughter begins. If you have ever stood at the side of a 
freeway when it's really humming, you will remember the sense of menace. The 
ground itself shakes. Consider that these people are mostly campesinos, or 
country people, not accustomed to the speed of these cars or an interstate's 
sheer size. They don't handle it very well. 
</P>
<P>
Often, they will hold hands as they start across, a pathetic and touching 
gesture. It's a measure of the fear they must feel and of their trust in each 
other. But alas, hand-holding turns out to be deadly. The last members of the 
string are usually the ones struck down. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, 101 illegals have been killed on these freeways. 
Another 110 have been struck. Combine those figures and it comes to roughly six 
persons a month being maimed or killed. 
</P>
<P>
There are a couple of possible reactions to this situation. You might say the 
pollos are getting what they deserve. After all, they're smuggling themselves 
into a foreign country and no one promised them a safe passage. 
</P>
<P>
Or you might ask why, in view of the monthly toll of blood and guts, the Border 
Patrol or Caltrans do not provide some sort of safe crossing for the illegals. 
A series of pedestrian bridges or underpasses where the INS would not be 
waiting with handcuffs and vans. Zones where timeout would be called on the 
nightly hunt. 
</P>
<P>
These zones could be modest in size, just the crossings themselves and a small 
patch of ground on either side. For running room. Once beyond the zone, the 
pollos would know that all bets were off and they were fair game once again. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the official agencies think this would shift the equation too far in 
favor of the illegals. Maybe they think it would make them look like wimps. In 
any case, they've produced a different solution. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, Caltrans and the Border Patrol proposed building 10-foot-high 
barriers on the freeways. The interesting part of the plan was this: the 
barriers would be built, not along the sides, but down the median strips. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the illegals could still run onto the freeways, they simply couldn't 
reach the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Why would an illegal run onto a freeway if he couldn't get across? A couple of 
reasons. He might bolt into traffic during hot pursuit by the Border Patrol. Or 
he might cross to the median strip because that's where his ride is supposed to 
pick him up for the journey north. In either case, we continue to squash 
illegals. 
</P>
<P>
Let me put the question this way: if 200 white, middle-class teen-agers had 
been run down on the San Diego Freeway over the last three years, would we be 
content with a plan that would put a barrier on the median strip? 
</P>
<P>
You answer. Even the sponsoring agencies seem to have sensed that the barriers 
might be perceived as ghoulish. And so they have produced a Plan B. What if, 
they ask, we reduce the freeways from eight lanes to four, two on each side? 
</P>
<P>
Their logic here is interesting. With only four lanes operating, the pollos 
would have a shorter distance to cross. Half the distance, in fact. Presumably, 
their success rate would go up commensurately. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you can get squashed just as dead on two lanes as you can on four. 
But not to quibble. This plan has a certain sporting quality. It comes across 
as a dare. 
</P>
<P>
And we could liven it up some more. Hand out free Nikes at the border, say. Or 
put up a few grandstands along I-5. 
</P>
<P>
For the curious, you know.

TROUBLE-PLAGUED SHUTTLE LANDS SAFELY AT NIGHT 
</P>

<P>
Descending from a clear, starlit desert night sky, the space shuttle Columbia 
landed safely here late Monday, ending a nine-day mission marked by technical 
glitches and scientific advances. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle touched down at 9:54 p.m. before a crowd of just more than 500 who 
braved 37-degree temperatures. "Houston, wheels are stopped at Edwards. We're 
home," said Vance D. Brand, commander of the Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger that, Columbia. Welcome home. Beautiful landing. Outstanding job," said 
astronaut Mike Baker from the Johnson Space Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
An approaching cold front bringing threatening weather forced NASA officials to 
cut the mission short by one day. The night landing, which ends the 38th 
shuttle mission and the 10th flight for Columbia, was the fourth in shuttle 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The launch of the shuttle was plagued by delays and the mission hampered by 
technical problems, but nevertheless yielded significant astronomical data. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the launch, both computers that were to point the four telescopes 
that study ultraviolet light and X-rays and lock them on their targets failed 
to work. The crew later found that lint clogging the air vents caused both 
computers to overheat. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts overcame the potentially mission-threatening glitch by working 
with technicians at Mission Control at the Marshall Space Flight Center in 
Huntsville, Ala., who radioed commands to point the telescopes in the general 
direction of their targets. Then the astronomers, working with a joystick 
similar to those used on video games, aimed the telescopes and locked them on 
target. 
</P>
<P>
Later, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials thought they 
would have to cut the flight short by one day because the drain tube for the 
waste disposal system jammed. The crew had to pump the waste water into plastic 
bags, restoring the system to working capacity. 
</P>
<P>
NASA spokesman Don Haley acknowledged that "as far as problems that were 
visible," this mission was probably the most trouble-plagued flight other than 
the Challenger explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties, NASA officials are elated at the volume of data the 
telescopes have yielded. "They collected more science than scientists and 
astronomers can assimilate," Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Astro Observatory aboard the Columbia contains four telescopes that can 
detect X-rays and ultraviolet light that are obscured by the Earth's 
atmosphere. They provided scientists with valuable data on various planets, 
stars and galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the telescopes also provided unprecedented evidence that indicates the 
existence of black holes. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, scientists reflected on their roller-coaster nine days at 
Marshall Space Flight Center. "For the scientists, we're just beginning" to 
study all the exciting data collected, said mission scientist Theodore Gull, 
who said he "broke down" after the emotional conclusion of science activity. 
"We know we are going to help rewrite the textbooks." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the telescope-pointing problems, which meant only 135 of 250 planned 
observations were made, the science part of the mission ended on the upswing, 
with the astronauts targeting a fast-moving comet just minutes before the three 
ultraviolet instruments were shut down. 
</P>
<P>
The workhorse Broad Band X-ray Telescope -- built at Goddard Space Flight 
Center and pointed independent of the Astro crew from a control room at the 
Greenbelt, Md., center -- operated for several more hours, taking a final look 
at a distant galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
"We went out with a bang," said Arthur Davidsen, who heads the team that built 
the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope at Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
Brand, 58, completed his fourth shuttle mission. Other crew members are pilot 
Guy S. Gardner, mission specialists Jeffrey A. Hoffman, John M. Lounge, Robert 
A. R. Parker, and payload specialists and civilian astronomers Samuel T. 
Durrance and Ronald A. Parise.

SURVEY FINDS STRONG SMOKING-LEUKEMIA LINK; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: ADVENTIST STUDY SAYS EVEN EX-SMOKERS ARE AT HIGH RISK. NUMBER OF 
CIGARETTES AND DURATION OF HABIT ALSO ARE FACTORS.

Cigarette smoking appears to be a major risk factor for the development of 
leukemia and may be responsible for more than 1 in 5 cases of the feared blood 
cancer, according to a study by Loma Linda University researchers. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers consider the findings particularly significant because almost 
all of the 34,000 Seventh-day Adventists studied who had smoked had stopped 
years earlier, suggesting that some of the adverse effects may not be 
reversible. The report increases the credence of other recent studies that have 
suggested a link between smoking and leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
The results, being published this month in the Journal of the National Cancer 
Institute, add to a growing list of cancers that have been linked to cigarette 
smoking. The list includes cancers of the lung, bladder, pancreas, esophagus, 
throat and perhaps the cervix. 
</P>
<P>
The study is part of the ongoing Adventist Health Study, a major 
epidemiological investigation of the causes of various cancers among California 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Although the vast majority of Adventists do not smoke by church proscription, 
many are adult converts to the religion who smoked cigarettes prior to their 
baptism into the church. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that the Adventist ex-smokers had twice the risk of 
developing leukemia than similar individuals who never had smoked. 
</P>
<P>
The results are "very discouraging," said Paul K. Mills, an assistant professor 
of preventive medicine at Loma Linda and principal author of the study. "We saw 
a strong association between prior cigarette smoking and the risk of developing 
leukemia." 
</P>
<P>
The findings "obviously strengthen the gathering impression that cigarette 
smoking is related to leukemia risk and that the association is likely to be 
causal," Dr. Clark W. Heath Jr., a vice president of the American Cancer 
Society, wrote in an editorial published in the medical journal along with the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of developing leukemia was also increased by a greater number of 
cigarettes smoked daily and a longer duration of smoking, which Mills said was 
"important evidence of a causal relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Individuals who regularly smoked more than 25 cigarettes a day had a threefold 
increased risk of developing leukemia. The Adventists who had smoked for more 
than 15 years had a 2 1/2-fold increased leukemia risk. 
</P>
<P>
Leukemia is a bone-marrow cancer in which the marrow is replaced by immature, 
abnormal white blood cells. Leukemia is a relatively uncommon tumor compared to 
breast, colon or lung cancer. Each year, there are about 27,000 newly diagnosed 
cases and 18,000 deaths attributed to leukemia in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
According to Heath, until 1986 it was generally accepted that tobacco use was 
not a significant cause of leukemia. Since 1988, several studies, including a 
large study of U.S. military veterans and two American Cancer Society studies, 
had provided preliminary evidence of a link. 
</P>
<P>
The causes of leukemia are largely unknown. Those that have been identified, 
such as the chemical benzene and ionizing radiation, appear to account for only 
a small percentage of cases, according to Heath. 
</P>
<P>
The Loma Linda study calculated that about 20% of leukemia cases were 
associated with prior smoking. In all, there were 46 new cases of leukemia 
diagnosed during the six-year study period. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of this and earlier preliminary studies, Heath estimated that from 
20% to 30% of leukemia cases may be linked to smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Because cigarette smoking is very common in the general population -- more than 
25% of adults smoke -- the proportion of total leukemia risk that may be 
attributed to cigarette smoking is significant, according to the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
In a related finding, the Loma Linda researchers found that ex-smokers among 
the Adventists had a threefold increased risk of developing myeloma, another 
bone-marrow tumor, as compared to individuals who had never smoked. Mills 
cautioned that this result should be considered "preliminary" because it was 
based on 23 cases. Previously, this association has not been closely examined. 
</P>
<P>
The Adventist Health Study began in 1974. Participants in the current study 
completed a questionnaire about their lifestyle in 1976 and were followed for 
the development of new cancers through the end of 1982.

INSPECTION PROGRAM FOR FISH ON LAWMAKERS' FRONT BURNER 
</P>

<P>
A main entree on Congress' menu next year is legislation to require federal 
inspection of fish. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike meat and poultry, which has undergone mandatory inspection for decades, 
fish is subject only to scattered, voluntary checks. 
</P>
<P>
But with seafood increasingly popular among health-conscious Americans, concern 
has risen about contamination from polluted waters, pesticide runoff, parasites 
and disease. 
</P>
<P>
Congress came close to passing a fish-inspection measure this year, but got 
hung up in "surf-and-turf fights" among competing maritime, agriculture and 
commerce committees. Those fights must be resolved when the new Congress 
convenes in January. 
</P>
<P>
The primary issue is whether to set up a broad program in the Agriculture 
Department -- which now oversees meat and poultry -- or to start a smaller 
effort in the Food and Drug Administration focusing mainly on shellfish, the 
source of most illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND: U.S. consumption of finned fish and shellfish has increased 
steadily, amid research showing health benefits. With this growth has come 
concern, and disagreement, about safety. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a consumer advocacy 
group, argues that Centers for Disease Control statistics show that the risk of 
acute illness from seafood is far greater than from meat and poultry. 
Approximately 65,000 illnesses and 22 deaths occur each year from seafood. 
</P>
<P>
However, Food and Drug Administration officials interpret the same data 
differently, contending, among other things, that such illnesses are decreasing 
on a per-pound-consumed basis. 
</P>
<P>
Undisputed is that most seafood-borne illnesses arise from three sources: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Microbiological pathogens from raw or undercooked molluskan shellfish, 
especially those taken from sewage-tainted waters; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Histamine poisoning caused by mishandling mahi mahi, mackerel and certain 
other fishes; 
</P>
<P>
 -- A naturally occurring toxin found in certain reef fishes. 
</P>
<P>
A key unknown is the extent to which chemical contamination of seafood may 
cause cancer. Ongoing research by the National Academy of Sciences may provide 
a clearer picture. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, seafood inspection is spotty, done at the invitation of processors, 
packers and others, largely for grading purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The National Fisheries Institute, an industry lobby, advocates strengthened 
inspection to boost consumer confidence and crack down on fraudulent practices, 
such as over-breading packaged fish. 
</P>
<P>
"We are almost alone among major fishing nations in not having a strong 
inspection program," says Richard Gutting, the institute's chief lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
ISSUES: Most hotly debated is whether a big program is either needed or 
affordable -- and which government agency should do the job. Proponents cite 
the agency's long experience with meat and poultry, but critics point to 
problems in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
One proposed approach calls for a broad inspection effort spearheaded by the 
Agriculture Department at a five-year cost of about $285 million. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative approach backed by the Bush Administration calls mainly for 
inspection of shellfish, building on a current FDA program at a cost of only 
$70 million. 
</P>
<P>
Another big issue involves plugging holes in fish inspection plans. For 
practical reasons, most bills call for spot checks of fish operations instead 
of the continuous review given meat and poultry. Labor unions and consumer 
groups want strong protection for whistle-blowing employees who report 
misconduct when fish inspectors are absent. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: Some of Congress' heaviest hitters -- including Sen. George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.), Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) 
and Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) -- want stepped-up fish inspection. 
But they disagree sharply over means. A compromise is likely, but only after 
fights that may rival the landing of a prize swordfish.

PROJECT TO STORE HEAT FROM SUN UNDERGROUND;

SYSTEM USES RETAINED WARMTH YEAR-ROUND. IT COULD REVIVE INTEREST IN SOLAR

On a recent rainy day, J. Edward Sunderland stood next to a weedy field here, 
pointing to the site of a project he hopes will help the nation in its quest 
for energy independence. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, the drab-looking field, on the campus of the University of 
Massachusetts at Amherst, will one day contain an array of solar collectors 
capable of supplying heat and hot water year-round to a future 12,000-seat 
sports arena, along with an existing gymnasium building. 
</P>
<P>
The project, under the direction of Sunderland, a professor of mechanical 
engineering at the university, would mark the first time in the United States 
that a facility the size of the arena, which is now under construction, was 
heated almost entirely by solar energy. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish the task, Sunderland and his colleagues are making use of a 
technology that has been used in several European countries, notably Sweden, 
but has yet to be tried here. 
</P>
<P>
The technology involves storing energy drawn from the sun in the warmer months, 
underground, to supply heat and hot water all year. 
</P>
<P>
Sunderland said he hoped the $3.7-million project would demonstrate the 
potential value of the technology. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a strategy that is extremely important for the country," he said, 
noting that it offered a practical way to use solar energy while reducing 
pollution and dependence on imported oil. 
</P>
<P>
Sunderland said that the solar heating industry in this country has foundered 
until now because it focused on sales of collectors for individual homes. 
</P>
<P>
Such small-scale systems are not economical, he said, because they lack the 
capacity to store heat from the collectors all winter. The loss of federal 
solar tax credits and a decline in fuel prices in the 1980s made them even less 
economical. 
</P>
<P>
But, due to economies of scale, systems built on the University of 
Massachusetts model are economical, Sunderland said. 
</P>
<P>
Universities, shopping malls, industrial parks, apartment buildings and even 
homes linked to a central heating source are all examples of facilities that 
could be heated efficiently by storing solar energy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The project here involves the placement of solar collectors in the 
approximately seven-acre field. An anti-freeze fluid within the collectors, 
heated by the sun, will be pumped through pipes into clay beneath the 
collectors. The clay will retain heat from the pipes throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
When heat or hot water is needed, fluid will be pumped through the pipes in the 
clay pit. After being warmed by the clay, it will continue in underground pipes 
to the sports facilities, one third of a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
Sunderland said that, because the solar system will not be ready when the arena 
is opened in 1993, the facility will initially be heated by the campus steam 
plant, as the gym currently is. But, once the solar system is in place, it will 
supply at least 85% of the 5,000-megawatt annual heat load of both buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Sunderland said that, within eight years, the project's costs, plus interest, 
will have been paid through savings in fuel. Those savings are projected to 
exceed $5 million after 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Dwayne S. Breger, senior research associate for the project, said that, with 
environmental benefits included, "the economics look very good." 
</P>
<P>
The project is generating interest among those in the solar energy field. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first in a genre that could become very important in this country in 
the next century as we try to shift away from fossil fuels," said Charles A. 
Bankston, a Washington solar energy consultant and former U.S. representative 
to the International Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
He said the project could spark interest not only in solar energy but in the 
potential for storing other energy, such as heat that otherwise would be lost 
in power plant generation. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sklar, executive director of the Washington-based Solar Energy Industries 
Assn., said a project showing that solar energy can be stored over a period of 
months "will have a profound impact on the public's attitudes of whether solar 
energy is realistic or not." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the university has received $650,000 in funding through the federal 
Department of Energy to design the project. An additional $3 million is needed 
to build it. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunderland said he is optimistic about obtaining the funds before work 
begins in about two years.

FOOD SHIPMENTS TRAPPED IN WEB OF SOVIET INEFFICIENCY

<P>
While other countries are shipping thousands of tons of food to the Soviet 
Union to offset feared shortages this winter, much of the country's own 
agricultural produce is sitting in railway yards and warehouses because of 
mismanagement, the Soviet press has charged. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation, to be frank, is catastrophic," Nikolai Garyushin, the head of 
the Soviet railways' chief administration for commercial transport, told the 
Communist Party newspaper Pravda on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The blockage in Moscow reflects what Soviet economists fear is the coming 
collapse of the whole rail transport system as more and more cars full of goods 
waiting to be unloaded jam the depots. 
</P>
<P>
Behind this, they see the accelerating disintegration of the whole Soviet 
economy, with producers unable to sell their goods to consumers, who in turn 
become frustrated at their inability to buy even daily necessities and 
increasingly fend for themselves outside the state-run economy, relying on the 
black market. 
</P>
<P>
The "food crisis," consequently, is regarded not as an agricultural failure but 
as a broader systemic collapse of the Soviet economy so that even the routine 
requirements it has coped with for decades are becoming nearly insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow alone, a weekend survey found 300 freight cars waiting to be unloaded 
and 20,000 containers awaiting delivery by the capital's trucking companies, 
according to Pravda. 
</P>
<P>
They contain everything from oranges, bananas, tea, coffee, sausages, butter 
and eggs to television sets, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, glassware, 
clothing and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the freight trains were 101 freezer cars of meat that had been purchased 
abroad to ease the severe food shortage here, Pravda said. The packing plant 
that was to process the meat was unable to cope with the shipment, so it has 
been left in the railway yard since it arrived Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Garyushin said the railroads' warehouses were virtual "cemeteries" with 
undelivered goods. He estimated that only a fifth of the goods now being 
shipped to Moscow were actually delivered to wholesale and retail outlets. Some 
supplies have been waiting for delivery since July, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign donors have expressed concern that their shipments might be caught in 
the transport blockage. So far, an estimated 1,200 tons have arrived by air, 
sea and land, with six to seven times that amount en route and more to come. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons given for the freight congestion is a shortage of storage 
facilities -- all warehouses of trading establishments are packed to capacity," 
Pravda said. "On the other hand, shop shelves are empty. Why? This question 
should be put before the leaders of the Moscow City Council who have been 
carried away with rallies." 
</P>
<P>
Yuri A. Tulupov, the director of a Moscow meat-packing enterprise, told the 
newspaper Argumenty i Fakty that the whole supply system was breaking down. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow this year was short 22,000 tons of sausage that should have been 
delivered from other regions, he said, but sausage had instead become a kind of 
currency to be exchanged for construction materials and consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Practical explanations for the breakdown varied. Officials said there were not 
enough drivers or trucks to take the goods away. Warehouses were too full to 
accept more goods. The orders were so old that the goods had to be reallocated 
to another buyer. The paperwork was not in order.

SHEVARDNADZE ASKS FOR U.S. FOOD TO EASE DIRE SHORTAGE; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: THE WHITE HOUSE INDICATES IT WILL WAIVE TWO MEASURES TO CLEAR THE 
WAY FOR SUCH AID.

<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, opening pre-summit talks with 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, appealed Monday for U.S. food aid to 
help the Soviet Union cope with critical shortages. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the White House indicated that President Bush is on the verge of 
granting a one-year waiver of two key congressional measures to clear the way 
for U.S. food credits and tariff reductions to aid the beleaguered Soviet 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters before the start of his meeting with Baker, Shevardnadze 
said the Soviet Union would appreciate U.S. assistance, "probably some food 
supplies." 
</P>
<P>
For months, the Bush Administration has said that it would consider assistance 
to Moscow only if the Soviet government specifically requested it. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet official said later that Shevardnadze made no specific requests for 
aid during his private meeting with Baker. 
</P>
<P>
However, the official said, "we do have a problem on food supply in our 
country. If any help would alleviate that we can only appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his appeal for food, however, White House officials said that the 
United States is more likely to send medical supplies than food parcels. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has been very slow in responding to the Soviet Union's winter 
of shortages. Western European nations, led by Germany, have already sent tons 
of food and other aid. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush decides to help, the Administration would urge private humanitarian 
agencies, such as Red Cross America, to help the Soviets with medical supplies, 
a White House aide said. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of food, the Administration appears on the verge of waiving the 
Jackson-Vanik Amendment and the companion Stevenson Amendment, which for 15 
years have barred U.S. trade and credit concessions unless the Soviets 
liberalized emigration practices. Jackson-Vanik was an amendment to the Trade 
Act of 1974 and Stevenson an amendment to the Export-Import Bank authorization 
bill of the same year. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet emigration of Jews and others is double the threshold rate of 60,000 a 
year, at which waivers were to be granted. 
</P>
<P>
New Soviet emigration laws have not yet been passed, however, and the 
Administration, which made the passage of those laws a condition of the 
Jackson-Vanik waiver, is still reluctant to act, although major Jewish groups 
favor doing so. 
</P>
<P>
After Shevardnadze's statement, indications are that Bush will waive the two 
amendments on a limited basis, for perhaps a year. 
</P>
<P>
Lifting Jackson-Vanik would end the discriminatory tariffs put on imports from 
the Soviet Union. The Stevenson Amendment, which limits export credits for 
grain purchases (through the Commodity Credit Corp. and other such agencies) to 
$300 million, would apply more directly to food aid. Lifting it could provide a 
way for the Soviets to buy grain from American farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Baker brought Shevardnadze to Houston, his hometown, for talks designed to 
prepare the way for a summit meeting early next year in Moscow between Bush and 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The most important item of unfinished business is completion of a treaty to cut 
the superpower arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons by more than one-third. 
Bush and Gorbachev have said they will schedule their summit as soon as a 
strategic arms reduction treaty is ready for signature. U.S. officials say the 
pact is about 95% complete but that some important differences remain. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Soviet officials said Baker and Shevardnadze concentrated on arms 
control throughout their 3 1/2- hour afternoon session. 
</P>
<P>
The officials declined to discuss specifics. But the Soviet official quoted a 
more senior member of the Soviet delegation as saying, "Bridges are being 
built." 
</P>
<P>
"That sounded like progess to me," the Soviet official said. 
</P>
<P>
Talk of arms control, the staple of U.S.-Soviet diplomacy during the Cold War, 
seems almost out of place in the current era of good feeling between Washington 
and Moscow. The onetime rivals find themselves on the same side in the Persian 
Gulf crisis, and officials on both sides are trying to minimize remaining areas 
of friction. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet official said that Shevardnadze supported Baker's refusal to visit 
Baghdad just three days before the Jan. 15 U.N. Security Council deadline for 
Iraq to get out of Kuwait. The official said Moscow endorses Baker's insistence 
that the trip take place no later than Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said Iraq has not yet responded to the U.S. position on 
dates. 
</P>
<P>
Baker on Sunday accused Iraq of stalling because of its suggestion of a Jan. 12 
date for Baker's trip to Baghdad.

U.S. FORCES TEST COMBAT SKILL IN DESERT EXERCISES

As diplomats plan the final details for meetings portrayed as the "last best 
chance" for peace, U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia are preparing for war by 
stepping up their tactical training and live-fire exercises. 
</P>
<P>
The desert exercises rely heavily on armor and are designed to take the 
initiative and counter the type of war that the numerically superior Iraqis 
would be expected to fight. 
</P>
<P>
Marine units have built defensive fortifications and berms in the desert 
similar to those used by Iraq, then stormed them, often at night, with armor 
and troops. 
</P>
<P>
Military police platoons are practicing urban assault and building-clearing 
techniques that they would use if they attempted to liberate Kuwait. The Army's 
63rd Chemical Company is training soldiers in the basics of decontamination. 
Military hospitals are running mock casualty drills. 
</P>
<P>
With U.S. troops from Germany pouring into Dhahran, capital of Saudi Arabia's 
oil-rich Eastern province, the Defense Department appears eager to publicize 
the story of the buildup and the intensified training. 
</P>
<P>
The 350 journalists who have descended on the desert kingdom no longer find 
their access limited to U.S. field units, as they did after Thanksgiving. They 
are now offered daily trips by the U.S. military to Marine and Army training 
exercises, Air Force facilities and Navy aircraft carriers. 
</P>
<P>
When the 1st Battalion of the 7th Marines heard on Armed Forces Radio last week 
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had ordered the freeing of Western and 
Japanese hostages in Kuwait and Iraq, there were high-fives and shouts of 
elation. "That's one battle won without firing a shot," said one of the 
Leathernecks. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone got psyched, hoping things were getting settled," said Lt. David 
Devore of Frederick, Md. "But we've got to maintain our edge. Everyone realizes 
that war is still imminent, that it's still possible." 
</P>
<P>
The next morning, the battalion commander, Col. Jim Matthis, told his troops: 
"This guy, Saddam Hussein, is a master at raising world hopes for peace, then 
dashing those hopes. Be a little skeptical. If things go wrong, we've still got 
a heck of a job to do in front of us." 
</P>
<P>
Then, he took his battalion into the heart of the Arabian desert for a 
three-day exercise against mock Iraqi defenses. Although his troops had trained 
daily, it was only the third time they had fired live ammunition in the last 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
Each company had managed to get hold of only one map, and the featureless 
terrain, marked by little more than shifting sand dunes, presented navigation 
problems, as it would in actual combat, for the drivers of the armored 
personnel carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Matthis' troops had arrived in Saudi Arabia in August from March Air Force Base 
in California expecting immediate combat. That adrenaline rush has since given 
way to the simple recognition that preparation is the best guarantor of 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys have really surprised me with their ability to stay focused on the 
mission," Matthis said. "I can see them improve in just a day on an exercise 
like this. Right now, they're sharp and focused, but if you stay out here long 
enough, at some point you peak and lose your edge. I'd say if we had to be here 
nine to 12 months, it would start costing us." 
</P>
<P>
Over and over, they assaulted a mock Iraqi position 1,200 yards away, their 
.50-caliber machine guns kicking up sparks on the targeted oil drums. They 
dashed out of their 40-m.p.h. tracked carriers, crawling across dunes on elbows 
and knees. 
</P>
<P>
They broke only to eat their pouches of freeze-dried food and to puff on a 
cigar or take a pinch of snuff -- habits that seem to have replaced the 
cigarettes everyone smoked in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Then they began again.

24,000 MARINES GET PEP TALK FROM LEADER

<TEXT>
<P>
The Marine Corps commandant, Gen. Alfred M. Gray Jr., addressing the largest 
assemblage of Marines in one place since 1942, bid farewell Monday to 24,000 
troops shipping out for Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech punctuated by the crying of children as the families of the 
departing troops looked on, the gruff Gray told the massive ranks of 
camouflage-clad Marines on the parade ground at Camp Lejeune that they are 
going to the Persian Gulf to "do what must be done" to defend the American way 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who on a September trip to Saudi Arabia ordered his troops to quit 
complaining and improve their morale, told these forces that their tour in the 
desert is open-ended. 
</P>
<P>
"How long will our warriors be in Southwest Asia? The answer is we will stay 
until we get our part of the missions and tasks accomplished, and then we will 
go somewhere else. Where? You will go where your commandant tells you to go," 
Gray boomed. 
</P>
<P>
The 24,000 men and women of the 2nd Marine Division will join 45,000 Marines 
already afloat and ashore in the gulf region. By the end of January, nearly 
90,000 Marines -- roughly three-fourths of the entire combat strength of the 
corps -- will be in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
The soon-to-be-departing Marines were treated to 20 minutes of vintage Gray -- 
bombastic and bellicose. The four-star general spelled out in simple terms why 
the United States has committed more than 400,000 troops to an inter-Arab 
dispute 8,000 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it crystal clear why we're in the gulf," Gray said. 
"Authoritative-type leaders cannot recklessly in a blitzkrieg-type operation 
invade a small country like Kuwait and inflict horror and terror and death on 
innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
Under an unusually mild and sunny December sky, Gray said: "This is not about 
oil but about stability in a very volatile region. We have a chance here for 
the children here today, and their children as they grow up, to have a more 
orderly and peaceful environment in that part of the world." 
</P>
<P>
After the speech, Pfc. Jamie Brock, 20, of Pell City, Ala., was asked if Gray's 
pep talk made the reason for the deployment any clearer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going over there to defend the country," he said, gripping his M-16 
rifle with bayonet fixed, waiting for the order to disperse. "I can't really 
explain it, but I know why we are going." 
</P>
<P>
The 2nd Marine Division, which saw action on the South Pacific islands of 
Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, Tinian and Okinawa, consists of 20,000 troops and 
is based at Camp Lejeune. They will be accompanied by their air wing and about 
2,000 service and support troops. Their armament includes 70 tanks and several 
hundred amphibious and armored vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The 2nd Division is also taking its 35-piece marching band, complete with a 
camouflage-painted tuba.

COST OF U.S. BUILDUP MAY HIT $37 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: NEW TROOP DEPLOYMENT COMPELS THE PENTAGON TO RAISE ITS ESTIMATE. IT 
PLANS TO ASK CONGRESS FOR MORE FUNDS TO HELP COVER EXPENSES.

Operation Desert Shield will cost an estimated $29 billion to $37 billion this 
fiscal year, forcing the Pentagon to seek supplemental funds from Congress as 
well as additional contributions from other countries, Pentagon officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The additional deployment of more than 200,000 fresh troops caused the Pentagon 
to adjust upward its earlier cost estimate of $17 billion -- an estimate that 
assumes no combat. In the case of war, independent analysts have estimated 
costs at as much as $1 billion or $2 billion a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is expected to seek new budget authority from Congress to fund the 
increases in the coming weeks, as its cost estimates become firmer. Congress in 
September directed the Defense Department to return with a supplemental funding 
request once the full costs of the deployment became clear. 
</P>
<P>
The new estimate is expected to intensify the debate about the costs of the 
massive U.S. deployment and the extent to which countries affected by the 
Mideast crisis are contributing to the U.S. effort. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, moved in part by growing congressional pressure, 
last week pressed Washington's North Atlantic allies to contribute more combat 
troops, logistic help and financial support to the Mideast deployment. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress has mentally adjusted itself to giving us a supplemental," said 
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, who added that lawmakers have long 
anticipated additional costs. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Congress' invitation for the Pentagon to adjust its estimates came 
before Cheney announced that the United States was sending a second wave of 
troops to bolster the force already there. The decision to mount the new 
deployment has drawn criticism from many leading lawmakers, including Senate 
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.). 
</P>
<P>
The accuracy of the cost estimates has become a politically sensitive issue for 
the Pentagon, which has said the new figures could change with rising fuel 
costs and help from third countries with the airlift and sea-lift of U.S. 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Some congressional analysts have questioned whether all the expenses provided 
for in the earlier Pentagon estimate were necessary for the deployment, 
including a $1-billion military construction budget. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Cheney has warned that the costly U.S. deployment could disrupt 
plans to shrink the size of the armed forces and scale back defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, we're conducting one of the biggest military operations in 
terms of the deployment of forces . . . and simultaneously talking about a 
long-term plan that takes down the size of the force. . . . It's easy to get 
schizophrenic about that process," Cheney said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is subject to review," he added. 
</P>
<P>
As the Pentagon continued the second wave of its massive troop deployment 
Monday, it announced that the Air Force is sending more F-15 Eagle fighter jets 
to the Persian Gulf area for Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
The Army also announced it had called to active duty another 1,457 reservists 
from 20 states, bringing the total number of reservists called up to 189,250. 
</P>
<P>
Elements of the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing at Bitburg, Germany, will deploy to 
the Middle East starting Dec. 28, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
It did not say how many planes will go; a tactical fighter wing normally would 
include about 70 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force in recent days has disclosed deployments of a variety of 
additional aircraft to the gulf.

SHUTTLE: A WHITE HOUSE PANEL RECOMMENDS DEVELOPMENT OF ROBOT VEHICLES. IT SAYS 
THE ODDS MAKE ANOTHER FATAL LAUNCH DISASTER LIKELY. 
</P>

<P>
Warning that another space shuttle disaster is likely in the next several 
years, a White House panel Monday recommended swift development of an 
alternative launch vehicle and stringent new limits on manned flights to reduce 
the risk to human life. 
</P>
<P>
The experts' report said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is 
counting too much on the shuttle, the centerpiece of the U.S. space program, 
despite the fact that it is too expensive, too risky and not necessary for many 
goals of space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle should be launched, the panel of experts concluded, only when human 
involvement is essential, and NASA should spend several billion dollars to 
develop an unmanned launch vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
With the aid of hindsight, the panel said, it was inappropriate to send seven 
crew members on the Challenger mission in 1986. All seven were killed when the 
shuttle exploded shortly after blastoff. 
</P>
<P>
NASA Director Richard H. Truly, responding to the recommendations of the 
12-member Advisory Committee on the Future of the U.S. Space Program, said he 
would take the recommendations seriously. But he added: "You can't have a 
risk-free space program. It's a risky business. We're not taking undue risk 
with human life." 
</P>
<P>
The committee resisted calls for a radical restructuring of NASA, but it said 
the agency has been "trying to do too much," given the time and money 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"America's civil space program is at a crossroads," said committee Chairman 
Norman Augustine, chief executive officer of Martin Marietta Corp. "NASA is 
neither as troubled as some would suggest, but not nearly as good as it will 
have to be to carry out the kind of space program that we recommend." 
</P>
<P>
The committee said it recognized that the United States must depend on the 
space shuttle through the end of the century. However, it strongly urged the 
space agency to improve the shuttle's reliability while using it only when 
essential to put humans into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
"The statistical evidence indicates that we are likely to lose another space 
shuttle in the next several years," the panel said in its unanimous report. 
"This would seem to be the weak link of the civil space program -- unpleasant 
to recognize, involving all the uncertainties of statistics, and difficult to 
resolve." 
</P>
<P>
Augustine put it more bluntly at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"It would not be at all surprising to us that we would lose at least another 
shuttle before the space station is in orbit," Augustine said. "Because of 
that, I think we need to prepare ourselves both emotionally and in terms of 
hardware and infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the panel was concerned "that the space shuttle may be the thin 
reed that supports our entire civilian space program." 
</P>
<P>
The review was prompted in part by the embarrassing defects in the long-awaited 
Hubble Space Telescope. The panel, appointed by Vice President Dan Quayle, made 
wide-ranging recommendations for a future space program: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Major emphasis on basic scientific research, including missions to take 
environmental measurements, a longer-range mission to put astronauts on Mars 
and the development of a modified space station to serve as a life-science 
laboratory and a base for planetary travel. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Development of a heavy-lift launch vehicle that could take over much of the 
cargo delivery work now scheduled to be done by the space shuttle when work 
starts on the space station in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A major overhaul of the design of the space station to reduce its cost and 
complexity, taking all the time needed to do the job right. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increased funding for the agency at the rate of 10% more than inflation 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A plan to exclude some NASA employees from federal Civil Service hiring, 
firing and pay limits to give the agency greater flexibility in recruiting and 
retaining top rocket scientists and other space specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A number of management changes, including changing how NASA operates its 
centers around the country in order to avoid counterproductive competition. 
</P>
<P>
In its discussion of the shuttle, the committee said the spacecraft would be 
absolutely essential to the U.S. space program for the next decade or more. 
</P>
<P>
"The space shuttle differs in important ways from unmanned vehicles," the 
report said. "On the positive side, it provides the flexibility and capability 
attendant to human presence, and it permits the recovery of costly launch 
vehicle hardware. 
</P>
<P>
"On the negative side, it tends to be complex, with relatively limited margins; 
it has not realized the promised cost savings, and should it fail 
catastrophically, it takes with it a substantial portion of the nation's future 
manned launch capability and, potentially, several human lives." 
</P>
<P>
While limiting future manned flights to missions that must have a human 
presence, the experts said, the agency also must "take those steps needed to 
enhance the shuttle's reliability, minimize wear and tear, and enhance launch 
schedule predictability." 
</P>
<P>
"We further conclude that NASA should proceed immediately to phase some of the 
burden being carried by the space shuttle to a new, unmanned . . . launch 
vehicle that offers increased payload capacity and (can be made) wherever 
practicable from existing components to save time and costs. 
</P>
<P>
"The resulting reduced demand for the shuttle will help relieve the schedule 
pressures which have contributed to some of the problems the program has 
encountered." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, who heads the National Space Council, said the panel would meet again 
in six months to determine what progress NASA had made on the recommendations.

WIVES MAINTAINED LONELY VIGIL AS SCANDAL CHANGED THEIR LIVES 
</P>

<P>
The accused and their wives were gathered in a hallway and a witness room of 
the U.S. District Courthouse on Monday, smoking cigarettes and making small 
talk, when the word came: The verdict was in. 
</P>
<P>
All conversation stopped. Smiles fell from faces. One deputy reached for his 
tie. Wives clutched their husbands' hands. 
</P>
<P>
After the attorneys had gathered from across town, it was time for the seven 
deputies to enter the courtroom -- 244p, U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie 
presiding. They crossed the threshold followed closely by reporters, who kept a 
respectful silence. The defendants were about to learn how their lives were to 
be changed, perhaps forever. 
</P>
<P>
The central question -- guilt or innocence, and all its attendant ramifications 
-- was etched in the faces of the deputies' wives. 
</P>
<P>
They did not have to wait long for the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"We find the defendant . . . guilty as charged," were the words the judge read 
over and over again, substituting one defendant's name for another, each 
accusation for the one that followed, until the guilty verdicts numbered more 
than two dozen. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was that six sheriff's narcotics officers, once considered among the 
finest within the Sheriff's Department, were convicted of conspiring to steal 
hundreds of thousands of dollars from suspected drug dealers. A seventh deputy 
was found guilty of illegally structuring currency transactions to evade 
reporting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom was calm as the verdicts were read. The defendants appeared 
stoical. 
</P>
<P>
There had been many days during the long course of the trial when the courtroom 
had been packed, filled with relatives of the defendants, fellow officers and 
curious outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, most of the spectators were absent. Many seats were empty, as only 
the wives of the accused showed up to support their husbands. These four sat 
together in the rear rows. 
</P>
<P>
Yhvona Garner, wife of Daniel Garner, sat with Jan Amers, the wife of defendant 
Terrell H. Amers. Across the aisle were the spouses of defendants Eufrasio G. 
Cortez and Ronald E. Daub. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdicts were read, Rafeedie polled the jurors. The four women looked 
earnestly at the jury, as if they hoped there had been some mistake, that one 
of the jurors would speak up and say that what was read and how they voted were 
not the same. 
</P>
<P>
There was no mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Daub's wife, her hands folded, began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
For Yhvona Garner, it evoked angry recollections of all those lonely nights 
when her husband was out on the street, putting his life on the line. It seemed 
to her that the justice system that her husband had served so faithfully in the 
end had failed him, miserably. 
</P>
<P>
"I get really angry thinking of all the hours he was away," Garner, whose 
husband has been in the Sheriff's Department for 18 years, would say later. 
"His life was put on the line several times. To think I could have lost him. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a cop's wife" she said shaking her head, "is not easy." 
</P>
<P>
One of the trial gadflies who gathered after the verdicts had been announced 
quickly went to work analyzing the effect of the moment on the deputies and 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they live . . . this'll be there," said Joe Fernandez, 58. He 
gestured toward the Amers as they walked arm in arm down the courthouse 
hallway: "See that? That's a family in ruin." 
</P>
<P>
Garner, standing in the hallway, said she could attest to that. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what they put us through is horrible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the months since her husband was indicted, she said, her family has endured 
the stares and speculation that come when your name is splashed regularly 
across the nightly news. She remembered the discomfort caused when her 
husband's picture would appear on the television of the beauty shop, where she 
worked styling hair. 
</P>
<P>
"When it all first happened," she said, "it was embarrassing. It was 
embarrassing trying to explain the injustice." 
</P>
<P>
After conferences with their attorneys, four of the deputies left the courtroom 
in a small band. Their sentencing will come later. Yhvona Garner walked from 
the courthouse with her husband. He wore dark glasses. She held his hand.

HEAD OF SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE SAYS STATE TAX BOOST IS INEVITABLE; 
</P>

WILL BE $5 BILLION TO $6 BILLION SHORT OF NECESSARY FUNDS OVER THE NEXT 18

<P>
The chairman of the Senate budget committee said Monday he sees no way to 
balance next year's state budget without a tax increase, but the tax question 
appeared to divide other lawmakers and public officials. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose), head of the Senate Budget and Fiscal 
Review Committee, commented on the need for a tax increase after a hearing at 
which top fiscal analysts agreed that the state will be $5 billion to $6 
billion short of the money needed to pay for state services over the next 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an almost obvious fact that this budget will not be balanced without 
additional revenues," Alquist said after the hearing. He said he wants the 
Legislature to consider raising the top rate of the personal income tax from 
9.3% to 11%, where it stood in 1987 before the Legislature reduced it. Such an 
increase would raise about $2 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, Alquist predicted, "will be dragged reluctantly into supporting 
revenue increases, as painful as that might be politically." 
</P>
<P>
The budget committee hearing was convened to discuss proposed legislation to 
implement lame-duck Gov. George Deukmejian's $1-billion emergency budget 
reduction plan. Deukmejian, who will turn over the reins of state government to 
fellow Republican Pete Wilson in January, has stubbornly resisted tax increase 
proposals of the size suggested by Alquist. Democrats are hoping that Wilson, 
who has been noncommittal, will prove to be more flexible. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers did not vote on any elements of the governor's plan during the 
three-hour hearing. Alquist's position drew support during the hearing from 
Sen. Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland) and state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill 
Honig. 
</P>
<P>
Other legislators voiced strong opposition after fiscal analysts released a 
chart showing that individuals and couples with annual taxable incomes of 
$60,000 or more -- about 12% of taxpayers -- were paying 70% of the income tax. 
The analysts noted that much of the current problem was because of the downturn 
in the economy, which is producing unemployment and business failures. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Bonita), chairman of the Senate Revenue and Taxation 
Committee, asked: "At a time when we are facing unemployment of 6.7% in 
California, at a time when we are in a state of recession, is this the time to 
raise revenue and tax the people who are actually feeling the pinch?" 
</P>
<P>
"We ought to begin with cuts, real deep cuts," Deddeh said, warning other 
Democrats, "I should not be counted on to vote for any type of tax increases." 
</P>
<P>
Honig argued that during the 1980s, tax policies pushed by then-President 
Ronald Reagan primarily favored corporations and upper-income people. Honig was 
backed by Petris, who said, "In spite of the moaning and groaning, the people 
on the top never had it so good . . . and the people on the bottom never had it 
so bad." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) and Honig got into a spirited exchange after 
Honig argued for a boost in income taxes to head off cuts in school programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you suggesting . . . that 12% of the taxpayers who are currently paying 
70% of the taxes should pay more? Is that what you are saying?" Seymour asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," replied Honig. "Of course, they are paying more. They get most of 
the income." 
</P>
<P>
"They would say they have already gone up too high," Seymour shot back. 
</P>
<P>
Budget analysts said the current problem stems from failure of the tax system 
to produce revenues fast enough to keep up with fast-growing student 
enrollments, prison inmate populations, health costs and bonded indebtedness. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse R. Huff, director of the Department of Finance, blamed the problems on 
the downturn in the economy and requirements to provide state services that 
have been built into state law, which he described as "a structural problem." 
</P>
<P>
The structural problem, Huff said, is that demands for services, most of them 
because of legal and constitutional mandates, are going up at a rate of about 
12% while California's tax system is growing at a rate of about 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Greer Lyle, executive director of the Commission on State Finance, said 
the imbalance between spending requirements and tax receipts could leave the 
state $5.7 billion to $6.2 billion short of what will be needed to pay for 
state services over the next 18 months. Previously, she had pegged the 
shortfall at $4.3 billion.

ASIAN-AMERICANS CHAFE AGAINST STEREOTYPE OF 'MODEL CITIZEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first, it might seem a curious complaint: 
</P>
<P>
The image of the Asian-American as a "model minority" has been "a favorite 
theme of American journalism now for 15 years, if not longer," says William 
Wong, associate editor of the Oakland Tribune. "There doesn't seem to be a lot 
of effort made by media to cover . . . the underbelly, the downside of the 
Asian-American experience." 
</P>
<P>
Blacks and Latinos frequently criticize the media for paying too much attention 
to the underbelly of their communities. Why would anyone object to being 
depicted the way Asian-Americans are widely depicted in the media -- as 
industrious and intelligent, enterprising and polite, with good values and 
strong families, equally successful as children in school and as adults in 
business and medicine and science and engineering and. . . ? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, Wong says, is that stereotyping, whether negative or positive, is 
"a psychological noose. . . . It denies our individuality." 
</P>
<P>
All stereotypes are inevitably "caricatures," says Helen Zia, managing editor 
of Ms. magazine; caricature "keeps people in ignorance" -- and ignorance may 
breed neglect and resentment. Or worse. 
</P>
<P>
Asian-Americans are successful -- even wealthy? They are polite -- even 
passive? Hmmm. Sounds as if they would make good targets for a mugging. 
</P>
<P>
Bingo. 
</P>
<P>
As the New York Times pointed out in October, there is a "growing and 
disturbing trend of subway attacks against people of Japanese, Chinese, Korean, 
Filipino and Vietnamese descent." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover: 
</P>
<P>
* Poverty rates among Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese families in the United 
States are much higher than for whites, but because Asian-Americans are 
generally perceived as being successful, they often find it difficult to obtain 
necessary social services and may be denied access to affirmative-action 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
* Asian-Americans who do poorly in school or need psychotherapy or fail in 
business may find their shortcomings especially difficult to accept, and 
especially embarrassing. After all, as Asian-Americans, they are supposed to 
excel. When they do not, they are "doubly burdened," says Diane Wong, executive 
director of the Asian American Journalists Assn.; already outsiders as Asians 
in America, they now feel isolated from their own community. 
</P>
<P>
* Some Asian-Americans students, feeling isolated from their peers by the 
"model minority" myth, may deliberately minimize their intelligence in an 
effort to fit in and win acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Zia says the media may be reluctant to probe beyond the "model minority" myth 
because "people don't want to hear about yet another minority with problems." 
Criticized for presenting too much "bad news," journalists may subconsciously 
see the Asian-American story as "good news" -- a chance to write about success 
rather than failure. 
</P>
<P>
Language and culture barriers also inhibit the presentation of a more complete 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
Most journalists "don't have the background to know what questions to ask," Zia 
says. 
</P>
<P>
K. W. Lee, editor of the English-language edition of Korea Times in Los 
Angeles, says that when he was assigned to write about the civil rights 
movement for the Charleston Gazette in the 1960s, he realized he could not do 
so intelligently unless he learned more about blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived with them," he said. "I read their literature." 
</P>
<P>
Most white journalists have not done that kind of homework on Asian-Americans, 
Lee says. 
</P>
<P>
Handicapped by ignorance and uncertainty, people often fall back on 
stereotypes. Hence the "model minority." 
</P>
<P>
Writer Frank Chin calls the "model minority" portrayal of Asian-Americans "the 
racism of love," but its effects are more often the former than the latter. 
</P>
<P>
Just as some anti-Semitic behavior has stemmed from a portrayal of Jews as 
having an "unnatural" advantage over non-Jews -- a special "cunning" or a 
"gift" for making money -- so Asian-Americans worry that whites who think that 
they have a special advantage or special skills will mistreat them. 
</P>
<P>
Already this mistreatment has taken the form of quota systems at prestigious 
colleges, and beatings and shootings in several cities. A recent poll showed 
that more than twice as many Americans think the security of the United States 
is threatened more by the economic power of Japan than by the military power of 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder. On two successive days late last month, Page 1 headlines in the New 
York Times said: "Japanese Portables Threaten American Lead in Computers" and 
"Japanese Expected to Take Over Another Major Hollywood Studio." 
</P>
<P>
Though still less than 3% of the U.S. population, Asian-Americans are the 
fastest-growing ethnic group in the country. They provided more than 40% of all 
immigrants in the past decade, during which time their population increased 
almost 80%. That growth -- combined with the burgeoning economic strength of 
Japan, the purchase of many U.S. businesses by the Japanese and the success of 
many Asian-Americans in traditional American enterprises -- has alarmed some 
whites. To them, Asian-Americans are "alien usurpers," taking jobs and college 
positions from the "true-blue Americans" to whom they "rightfully belong." 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Ronald Ebens, a former Detroit auto worker, clubbed Vincent Chin to 
death outside a suburban Detroit nightclub after -- according to some reports 
-- mistaking Chin, a Chinese-American, for a Japanese, yelling racist remarks 
at him and blaming people "like him" for the recession in the U.S. auto 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Ebens, who denied making racist remarks and insisted that Chin provoked the 
attack, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to three years' 
probation and fined $3,700. The Asian-American community was outraged by his 
light sentence and by his subsequent acquittal on charges of violating Chin's 
civil rights. Asian-Americans were also angry over what they perceived as a 
dangerous omen -- scapegoating, a common element in racist behavior -- and they 
have been equally alarmed by manifestations of that behavior elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
A gunman killed five children from Southeast Asia at a Stockton elementary 
school. White and Vietnamese fishermen have clashed in California and Texas. 
Blacks have boycotted Korean greengrocers in several cities. 
</P>
<P>
No one is suggesting that if the Stockton gunman had read three insightful 
stories about Asian-Americans in his local newspaper, he would have become a 
social worker instead of a mass murderer. But critics do say the press could 
help alleviate rather than exacerbate racial tensions if they provided more 
enlightened reporting, rather than simply perpetuating stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times has published several stories examining the stereotype and 
related issues, and a few other publications have done stories here and there 
-- USA Today, on Page 1, last month, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Downie, managing editor of the Washington Post, illustrates the problem 
when he tries to explain why most of the media do not provide more and better 
coverage of Asian-Americans: 
</P>
<P>
"These are just quiet people who come here, go to work and go to school and do 
a good job and don't ask for coverage and don't make themselves very visible in 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
So what kinds of stories might the media do about Asian-Americans? 
</P>
<P>
Like blacks, Latinos and American Indians, Asian-American journalists say the 
media should work harder to include them in the routine, daily news coverage 
and not do stories on them only when it is a specifically Asian-American 
subject. Asian-Americans say journalists should also distinguish among the 
many, different communities -- Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Filipino, 
Cambodian -- rather than lumping them all together as Asian-American. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, Asian-American journalists say, the media should do 
more stories that do not just say "what" in potentially divisive terms but tell 
"why" in potentially enlightening terms: 
</P>
<P>
* Why do Asian-Americans have a higher average household income than any other 
group? Answer: In part because most live in urban centers in California, Hawaii 
and New York, where salaries are higher, and because many have more than one 
job and live in families that have multiple wage-earners. 
</P>
<P>
* Why do some Korean merchants seem cold and hostile, refusing to directly 
place a customer's change directly in the hand -- a charge that helped trigger 
the black boycott of Korean greengrocers in New York early this year. Answer: 
"In the Confucian-steeped Korean culture, a smile is reserved for family 
members and close friends," says C. Connie Kang, assistant metropolitan editor 
of the San Francisco Examiner. "Expressions such as 'thank you' and 'excuse me' 
are used sparingly," and strangers do not generally touch each other, not even 
to return change in a business transaction. 
</P>
<P>
* Why have Asian-Americans generally been more successful in the United States 
than many blacks and Latinos? Answer: Multiple explanations, among them a 
longstanding reverence of and opportunity for education in Asian societies, and 
the likelihood that immigrants from Asia are among the better-educated, more 
successful members of their native societies. Their decision to emigrate is a 
process of self-selection, completely different from the enforced migration and 
slavery of blacks or the flight from poverty of many Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
For all the stories about boycotts and quotas and takeovers, "The press is not 
sophisticated about immigration," says Rodolfo Acuna, a professor of Chicano 
studies at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, John Ogbu, an anthropologist at UC Berkeley, says there is an important 
distinction between the immigrant experience of "voluntary minorities," such as 
many Asians, Cubans and certain Central and South Americans ("those who have 
more or less chosen to move . . . in the belief that this change will lead to 
an improvement in their economic well-being or to greater political freedom") 
and "involuntary minorities," such as most blacks, Latinos and American Indians 
("people initially brought into the United States through slavery, conquests or 
colonization"). 
</P>
<P>
"Involuntary minorities" may perceive the "social, political and economic 
barriers against them as part of an undeserved oppression," Ogbu says, and many 
may adopt "survival strategies" that incorporate distrust of and rebellion 
against white institutions and behavior patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Ogbu explained his theory in the journal Daedalus this year, but there has been 
little such analysis in the mainstream press. 
</P>
<P>
In covering the conflict between Korean greengrocers and black customers, for 
example, the media often failed to point out that many of the Koreans who 
opened those stores may have been among the "most confident, the most 
enterprising . . . the bravest Koreans," says John Lee, a Korean reporter at 
the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, 75% of the Korean greengrocers in New York had college degrees before 
coming here, and to them, becoming a shopkeeper is not an entrepreneurial dream 
come true but "dashed dreams, a step downward in status," as Ronald Takaki, 
professor of ethnic studies at UC Berkeley, wrote in the New York Times last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
The frequent failure of the media to point out such information leads to unfair 
comparisons between Koreans and blacks as ghetto businessmen and contributes to 
escalating racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Wong is also concerned that this has enabled "nefarious demagogues" and 
"self-serving politicians" to invoke the "Asians made it; why can't blacks?" 
argument to "put down . . . African-Americans and Latinos" and to "dismantle 
affirmative-action programs" for these minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Wong says the "yawning ignorance" of most white journalists about Asian culture 
and about "the complexities and diversity in the fast-changing Asian-American 
community" is largely responsible for making this possible.

CRITIC AT LARGE: A SALUTE TO A SCRAPPY HOLLYWOOD WARRIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one who loved the race track as much as Martin Ritt did could be anything 
but an optimist. The realist and the pessimist tear up the tickets and walk 
away never to return. Ritt, who died Saturday morning of cardiac arrest at the 
age of 76, never lost his faith that the next horse was a sure winner, or that 
his next film could make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
Socially, Ritt was an odd and admirable mixture of realist, optimist and 
idealist, all toned with a dark-voiced truculence. The director saw the real 
world with a hard-eyed candor and one of his finest films is "The Spy Who Came 
in From the Cold," with Richard Burton as the doomed agent Lemass in that 
iciest of the Cold War dramas. 
</P>
<P>
But Ritt also saw the good guys, or the good women, coming out ahead now and 
again, and his blend of social realism and ultimate hope made "Norma Rae" the 
best and most successful film of his later years. Sally Field as a defiant mill 
worker was a character dear to Ritt's heart. 
</P>
<P>
Like Winston Churchill, Ritt favored the one-piece coverall garments known in 
wartime as siren suits because you could get into them quickly when the 
air-raid sirens blew. For Ritt, the suit doubled as a convenience and as an 
implicit statement of his impatience with social conventions and tie-wearing 
conviviality. He was a very private man in a profession whose members 
occasionally vie with their stars for publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Like many private people, he was intensely loyal to friends, who were often 
longtime colleagues and collaborators. His association with the 
husband-and-wife writing team of Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr. was one 
of the longest and most productive in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
It was a major regret to Ritt that their last collaboration, and his last film, 
"Stanley and Iris," was a critical and commercial failure. Its theme -- the 
solvable tragedy of adult illiteracy -- was characteristic of his concern with 
social issues. But he and the Ravetches could look back on such honored films 
as "The Long Hot Summer," "Hud," "Hombre" and "Norma Rae." 
</P>
<P>
With another colleague and friend, producer Robert Radnitz, Ritt had done 
"Sounder," which remains one of the best (and most successful) films about the 
black experience in America. "Cross Creek," their film about writer Marjorie 
Kinnan Rawlings, had a mixed response but it carried the inevitable Ritt 
hallmarks of impeccable craftsmanship, sensitive performances, and an 
appreciation of the influence of environment on character and lifestyle 
(captured in the fine images of another Ritt friend and collaborator, 
cinematographer John Alonzo). 
</P>
<P>
Ritt was not alone among filmmakers in his insistence, born of his bone-deep 
liberal humanism, that movies ought to be about something and should ideally 
address the real world with some indication that good can prevail if good 
people will work at it. Like nearly all filmmakers, his efforts to achieve his 
vision often meant conflicts with controllers of the purse strings and, like 
nearly all filmmakers, he did not always win, as in the compromised ending and 
the starry (Jane Fonda, Robert DeNiro) but inappropriate casting of "Stanley 
and Iris." 
</P>
<P>
But Ritt won often enough to create an invaluable legacy of socially concerned 
dramas which have helped to define not only what the movies can do, but what 
they ought always to be doing, and can now do as a salute to the memory of a 
scrappy Hollywood warrior.

THE SPORTING LIFE: Roy Firestone is on the phone from Maui. 
</P>
<P>
It's suddenly peak season for television's best sports interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
Firestone, who turned 37 on Saturday, is marking the 10th anniversary of his 
daily ESPN series, "SportsLook." And changes are in store for the show, which 
will sport a new name and a "more journalistic" approach right after the New 
Year, says Firestone. 
</P>
<P>
He'll also be the new co-executive producer: "We're going to be able to do 
'Nightline' kinds of things. What we've been missing is the technology to get 
out to everybody who's making news, not just who's in town." 
</P>
<P>
Firestone's co-executive producer, Bob Seizer, says ESPN is trying to get title 
clearance for "Up Close" as the new name of the half-hour series. 
</P>
<P>
But first, on Dec. 28, Firestone will say farewell to his past decade with an 
hour special of the "best moments from 'SportsLook.' " 
</P>
<P>
Firestone has long led a double life -- performing as a comedian as well -- and 
that career is also blossoming. He steps up in class starting Thursday by 
co-headlining with Lou Rawls at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I've co-headlined," he says. 
</P>
<P>
HE AND SHE: Ken Olin has directed his wife, Patricia Wettig, before in 
"thirtysomething," the ABC series in which they both star. But tonight's 
episode is rather extra-special. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "Guns &amp; Roses," it deals with how the cancer-stricken Nancy (Wettig) 
deals with problems as her therapy begins to have an effect on her relationship 
with her children. 
</P>
<P>
Wettig has won two Emmys as Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
And what was challenging about tonight's show, says Olin, was how it "deals 
with the process of cancer and juxtaposes that with the details of everyday 
life. This woman's a mother and wife, and you have to combine these things." 
</P>
<P>
Olin knows viewers are looking for clues as to "whether she's going to live. 
But this show is a thematic point rather than a turning point in the plot. It's 
about this character deciding that she's going to take the risk to want to 
live. It asks: When you're so sick, is it easier to not want to live?" 
</P>
<P>
The next directing assignment for Olin on "thirtysomething," possibly for a 
February air date, "is about Nancy's second-look surgery," he says. "I think 
there will be some traces of whether she's going to be successful in beating 
the illness." 
</P>
<P>
Olin knows the answer, but won't say. 
</P>
<P>
THAT'S NEWS BIZ: Make a note: Carol Burnett's "Carol &amp; Company" has a 
wonderfully vicious episode Jan. 5 skewering TV news shows that take the 
entertainment route. Burnett plays an anchor. Her news director came from game 
shows and brings in a studio audience that decides, through boos and cheers, 
which stories are broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: After Madonna's "Nightline" interview, the Jay Leno camp 
was wondering: "What's next -- a Persian Gulf special on the 'Tonight' show?" 
</P>
<P>
CLOWN PRINCE: What a brilliant performance Mort Sahl gave on the Ha! channel -- 
about a visit to the White House. It only made you aware, again, of the 
inadequacy of most of TV's endless parade of stand-up comics, who know all the 
patter, all the moves, all the shtick -- but have nothing to say. 
</P>
<P>
TYPECAST: Really, Anita Morris is much too good to be stuck in another of those 
routine sex-bomb roles in which she turned up last week in CBS' "WIOU." 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: "The meek may inherit the Earth, but it's the grumpy who get 
promoted." Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher) in "MASH."

'73 SONDHEIM SALUTE: NEW AND IMPROVED; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: A DIGITALLY REMIXED AND REMASTERED VERSION OF THAT ALL-STAR NIGHT OF 
MUSICAL THEATER IS BEING RELEASED ON CD. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was an evening to remember -- an evening in which the events actually 
surpassed the hyperbole of the most imaginative press agent. 
</P>
<P>
It was March 11, 1973, a rainy, muggy night in New York City, and some of the 
brightest names in Broadway musicals had assembled at the Shubert Theatre to 
honor Stephen Sondheim. The cast list read like an all-star role call of the 
musical theater: Dorothy Collins, Hermione Gingold, Pamela Hall, Glynis Johns, 
Larry Kert, Angela Lansbury, Donna McKechnie, Chita Rivera, Nancy Walker -- and 
many, many more. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how thrilling it was," Lansbury said, "to be together with so 
many of my contemporaries in what still was, at that time, a very healthy 
musical theater. 
</P>
<P>
"It was because of Sondheim that I went into musicals in the first place. The 
two songs in 'Anyone Can Whistle' that I sang at the benefit concert 
represented my introduction to musical theater, and they were killers. But it 
was Sondheim's encouragement that enabled me to make it, finally, through 
'Whistle' into 'Mame' into 'Dear World' and then back with Sondheim to 'Gypsy' 
and, finally, 'Sweeny Todd.' 
</P>
<P>
"So I was thrilled to be part of the tribute. And the thing that was most 
striking to me was the sense of the audience's emotional participation. It was 
a stirring example of the way the musical theater used to be when there was a 
total rapport between the artists and the orchestra and the audience." 
</P>
<P>
The critically praised performance was preserved on a Warner Brothers recording 
that was withdrawn from distribution within a year -- so quickly, in fact, that 
it has virtually become a collector's item. This week, however, a digitally 
remixed and remastered version has been released on a two-CD set by RCA Victor. 
</P>
<P>
It is a significant improvement over the original package with an added number 
-- Pamela Myers' performance of "Another Hundred Clowns" from "Company" -- as 
well as an expanded version of the full overture. 
</P>
<P>
"When we did this new digital version," said Craig Zadan, one of the producers 
of the 1973 concert, as well as the producer of the new RCA release, "we 
stripped down the tracks, started from scratch and put it all back together 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the problems were untouchable: If there was feedback on the original, 
there's feedback now. If someone walked away from a mike, there wasn't much we 
could do about the dropout of sound. But the digital technology allowed us to 
come close to re-creating the sound in a way that authentically chronicles the 
energies of a very exciting evening." 
</P>
<P>
Recollections of the evening still resonate with unusual potency in the 
memories of the participants. Alexis Smith, who was in "Follies" at the time, 
recalled watching her colleagues in action from an unusual perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"We were seated in little gold chairs on the stage behind whomever was 
singing," she said. "And it was so fascinating to watch the nervous tension 
manifesting itself on the backs of the performers -- knowing, of course, that 
out front everything looked just absolutely divine. But everyone was so eager 
to do their best for Sondheim -- who is such a perfectionist, and who tries so 
hard to stimulate a performer's best work." 
</P>
<P>
Donna McKechnie's choreography for the show -- which was produced as a benefit 
for the American Musical and Dramatic Academy and the National Hemophilia 
Foundation -- took three months to prepare. Since several numbers were done by 
performers who were not in the original shows, she decided to retain the spirit 
of the original choreography without duplicating it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to keep the essence, and the feeling tone of the way the numbers had 
originally been staged," McKechnie said, "without re-creating anybody's 
choreography. And I'm glad I did, especially when I did 'America' from 'West 
Side Story' with Chita Rivera -- who was so great in the original version. 
</P>
<P>
"But this was an evening without any of the little differences -- the tensions 
and insecurities that can flare up in most companies. And I think it was 
because everybody was so devoted to Sondheim -- who taught all of us the value 
of the ensemble in the musical theater -- and so devoted to making the 
performance something special." 
</P>
<P>
The most unanticipated high point of the tribute came when Nancy Walker 
strolled on stage to sing the ultimate survivor's anthem from "Follies," "I'm 
Still Here." 
</P>
<P>
For Walker, who did not do the number in the original show, the song touched 
raw interior feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, that performance changed my life," she said. "You have to understand that 
I had moved to California a few years earlier because I hadn't been able to get 
work on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"So when I got the call to come back and do the Sondheim show, I went back to 
New York still quite angry, and I think a lot of that came through in the 
song." 
</P>
<P>
Walker had virtually no rehearsal and was having difficulty remembering the 
lyrics right up to show time. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, when I walked out on stage," she said, "I remembered it, thank God, and 
everything came together. It was as if all the years I had worked, and all the 
things I was capable of doing, suddenly came together into that song. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember feeling a great trembling in back of me, so I just stepped aside 
and let it go past. And of course, it was my own excitement and the strength of 
the years that I had worked. I didn't know if it was going to be received well 
or not, but it was the only way I could sing it." 
</P>
<P>
The reception for the number -- which is one of the album's high points -- was 
matched only by the appearance of Sondheim at the close of the show for a 
brief, almost poignant reading of "Anyone Can Whistle." 
</P>
<P>
"He's the only genius I've ever worked with," said Beth Howland. "And when he 
came out to finish the evening at the piano, I thought I'd have a heart 
attack!" 
</P>
<P>
But the tribute may have been summed up best by Walker, for whom it was a 
revitalization in the best Sondheim tradition: 
</P>
<P>
"I walked out of the theater that night thinking, 'My God, this is the most 
exciting business to be in!' "

6 DEPUTIES GUILTY IN CORRUPTION CASE; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: MEMBERS OF ELITE TEAM CONVICTED OF CONSPIRING TO STEAL CASH FROM 
TRAFFICKERS, MONEY LAUNDERERS. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS INVOLVED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Six Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were convicted Monday of conspiring 
to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars from drug traffickers and money 
launderers in one of the biggest corruption scandals in local law enforcement 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran narcotics officers, who worked together on an elite team 
investigating major drug cases, were convicted on 24 criminal charges involving 
money seized during drug raids. The jury rendered the verdicts on its seventh 
day of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-man, five-woman jury convicted the officers of various charges, 
including conspiracy, theft, money-laundering, racketeering and tax evasion. 
The deputies were acquitted on three separate theft counts. A seventh narcotics 
deputy was also convicted of depositing funds in a way to evade bank reporting 
requirements and conceal their source. 
</P>
<P>
Facing prison terms of up to 53 years, the deputies are scheduled for 
sentencing in January and February. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies expressed little emotion as U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie 
read the unanimous verdicts and then declared a mistrial on 26 additional 
charges on which the jury was deadlocked. As the defendants walked from the 
federal courtroom in downtown Los Angeles, they appeared stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed with the verdict," said Deputy James R. Bauder. "I'm sure the 
jury did the best job they could, but we're disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for some of the deputies said their clients would have no comment 
because of a gag order imposed earlier in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just floored by the conviction of (Terrell H.) Terry Amers," said his 
attorney, Paul R. Depasquale, "and I have no further comment." 
</P>
<P>
The other deputies convicted were Ronald E. Daub, Eufrasio G. Cortez, John C. 
Dickenson, Macario M. Duran and Daniel M. Garner. All except Duran had worked 
on the same drug investigation team known as Majors II. Only Duran escaped a 
conspiracy conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Although the prosecution alleged that the deputies stole more than $1.4 million 
during drug raids in 1988 and 1989, the jury found six guilty of skimming only 
$48,000 -- the amount taken during a video-taped FBI sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the verdicts speak for themselves. It is our position . . . that 
jury's verdicts reflect that the jury accepted the allegations in the 
indictment that there was corruption in Majors II," said Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Jeffrey C. Eglash, one of the co-prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
There was little jubilation among prosecutors and sheriff's officials who had 
spent more than two years investigating the massive case that rocked the 
nation's largest sheriff's department. The scandal led to the dismantling of 
anti-drug teams, the transfers of dozens of narcotics officers and a series of 
ongoing probes that has spread from the Sheriff's Department to the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 criminal cases were dismissed, were subjects of plea bargains, or 
are under review as a result of the corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"The verdicts handed down today are not an occasion to celebrate, they are not 
a victory," Sheriff Sherman Block said in a statement. "They are the just 
conclusion to the unlawful actions of a few who sought to hide their crimes 
behind a badge of honor." 
</P>
<P>
The convicted deputies included some of the department's most decorated and 
experienced. Among the defendants were a medal of valor winner who was wounded 
in a vain attempt to save his partner; a deputy who was the recipient of the 
California narcotics officer-of-the-year award, and a second-generation deputy 
whose father served as a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Some jurors said it was disturbing to see law enforcement officers turn to 
corruption, using stolen money to buy such luxuries as cars, boats, jewelry and 
vacation homes. After the seven-week trial they said they were persuaded to 
convict: 
</P>
<P>
* Cortez, 39, on six counts including conspiracy, theft, tax evasion and 
money-laundering. A 15-year department veteran, Cortez was once honored by the 
California Narcotics Officers Assn. as a top drug officer in the state. He 
faces 53 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
* Daub, 39, on six counts of conspiracy, theft, tax evasion and structuring 
financial transactions to evade bank reporting requirements. A 17-year 
department veteran, he faces 48 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
* Garner, 44, for three counts of conspiracy, theft and tax evasion. Hired as a 
sheriff's officer in 1971, he faces 18 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
* Bauder, 32, for conspiracy, theft and tax evasion. A 10-year department 
veteran and second-generation sheriff's deputy, Bauder's father had retired as 
a lieutenant in the narcotics bureau. He faces 18 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
* Amers, 47, for conspiracy, theft and tax evasion. With 23 years of service, 
Amers was the most experienced of the deputies. He faces 18 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
* Dickenson, 32, for conspiracy and theft. An 11-year veteran, Dickenson won 
the Medal of Valor in 1988 for attempting to save his mortally wounded partner 
during a shoot-out with a drug suspect. He faces 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
* Duran, 44, for a single count of structuring currency transactions to evade 
reporting requirements. While prosecutors claim he was hiding stolen drug 
money, Duran said he and his wife had actually skimmed money from her beauty 
shop and had failed to report it to the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
Duran faces a five-year prison term on that conviction. The jury could not 
reach a verdict on whether the 14-year department veteran had conspired with 
the others to steal money during drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Duran, all the deputies on trial were convicted of a 
single theft charge -- the stealing of $48,000 during an August, 1989, sting 
that was conducted by FBI undercover officers to snare the narcotics officers. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, prosecutors played a videotape of the sting, showing Bauder 
and Garner entering the hotel room of an FBI agent, who was posing as a money 
launderer, and taking bundles of cash from a bag. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the operation, hundreds of federal and local agents, armed with 
warrants, raided the deputies' homes and offices. Authorities discovered marked 
bills from the sting at the houses of four deputies. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews at the courthouse, jurors told The Times that they considered the 
videotape damning evidence against the deputies. Also crucial, according to the 
jurors, was a tape recording secretly made of the deputies by the government's 
chief witness -- former Sheriff's Sgt. Robert R. Sobel, who cooperated in 
exchange for a reduced sentence. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the indicted deputies had worked for Sobel on the Majors II 
anti-drug team, a squad responsible for some of the department's largest 
cocaine and money seizures. 
</P>
<P>
In agreeing to testify, Sobel was allowed to plead guilty to single counts of 
conspiracy and filing a false tax return. Prosecutors also dropped five theft 
charges against him and shaved his maximum possible prison sentence from 58 
years to eight. He is awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
As the key witness against the deputies, the 45-year-old Sobel spent three days 
detailing how he and his crew members skimmed money, beat drug suspects and 
then lied in official reports to cover up the misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the trial, defense attorneys and their clients had sought to portray 
Sobel as an admitted liar and thief -- traits he possessed long before he 
joined the defendants as their supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the tapes, the prosecution presented 155 witnesses and more than 
1,000 pieces of evidence including the defendant's financial records to try to 
link the stolen drug money to a torrent of cash purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors took jurors painstakingly through bank records, sales receipts, 
escrow papers and detailed charts to show that the deputies were spending far 
in excess of their department paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the deputies had been buoyed by the weeklong jury deliberations, 
believing the longer the panel was out, the better their chances for acquittal. 
But at 11:08 a.m., when the verdicts came in, their demeanor turned somber. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the verdict, Rafeedie set separate sentencing dates for each 
deputy beginning in January. All remain free on bail despite prosecutors' 
attempts to have Bauder, Garner and Cortez jailed. Although prosecutors 
described as them as flight risks, Rafeedie rejected the argument. 
</P>
<P>
The closely watched trial was the first of three scheduled in federal court for 
defendants linked to the money-skimming scandal. Two other narcotics deputies 
-- Nancy A. Brown and Michael J. Kaliterna -- are slated to stand trial early 
next year. Another trial involving Duran, his wife and his mother is scheduled 
to begin next February, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a federal grand jury has been investigating other sheriff's deputies 
and several Police Department narcotics officers for allegations that surfaced 
during the money-skimming probe, including accusations of thefts, beatings and 
the planting of drugs on suspects during raids. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's verdict had been anticipated by many as a barometer of how successful 
the prosecution would be in pursing a criminal case against veteran officers 
who have staunchly proclaimed their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had contended that the deputies routinely stole money from drug 
dealers and money launderers after first detaining the suspects during 
narcotics raids. 
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, the deputies would stop a money courier or drug 
trafficker and ask the suspect to sign a disclaimer waiving any ownership of 
the money. Then, they would skim some of the cash before the money arrived in 
the evidence room at the Sheriff's Department's narcotics headquarters in 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the forfeited money would be turned over to the department, some 
of the cash would be stolen and divided among the deputies, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, Cortez, Garner and Amers were accused of stealing $527,000 during 
a 1988 raid. They were acquitted on that charge by jurors who said they found 
it difficult to believe the testimony of the drug dealer who said that he was 
victimized by the theft. 
</P>
<P>
Eglash added that prosecutors would decide later whether to retry the deputies 
on the remaining charges. 
</P>
<P>
The convictions are expected to spur prosecutors in other related trials. 
</P>
<P>
The trials of Brown and Kaliterna were severed from the others in a legal 
dispute over whether evidence obtained during a search of their homes and cars 
-- including money that prosecutors claim is linked to the videotaped sting -- 
could be used against them. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Levine, who represents Kaliterna, did not believe Monday's convictions 
would force some of the deputies to testify against his client. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the trial they have been pressured to cooperate and they have 
resisted because they were innocent. I don't think their feelings are going to 
change any because of the verdict," Levine said.

SACRAMENTO FILE: NOW SALUTES TWO LEGISLATORS FOR WORK ON WOMEN'S ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) and Sen. Dan McCorquodale 
(D-San Jose) have been picked as the outstanding state legislators of 1990 on 
women's issues by the California National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
Roybal-Allard was chosen for her legislation to help female victims of sexual 
assault and domestic violence, including a major date-rape bill that was signed 
into law by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
The date-rape law provides that in sex-offense cases where consent of the 
victim is an issue, a current or previous dating relationship is not enough for 
the defendant to use consent as a legal defense. The law takes effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The first male legislator to receive the California NOW award, McCorquodale was 
active in a fight that led to the resignation of the president of the state 
Maritime Academy after a sexual harassment scandal.

J. ALEXANDER; JOURNEYMAN OPERA TENOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Alexander, a journeyman tenor praised for his vocal purity and lengthy 
career but consigned often to backup roles at the Metropolitan Opera, died 
Saturday after performing in his hometown of Meridian, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
He was 67 and suffered a heart attack shortly after appearing in concert at the 
Temple Theater in a benefit for restoration of the city's 100-year-old opera 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone here is amazed at the poetic-ness of his death," said his son-in-law, 
David Staples. "He was doing a major performance for the first time in three 
years. He was with his friends from the world of opera and was back in 
Mississippi, which he loved and where he always wanted to be buried in his 
family's plot." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander was best known for his Mozart -- Belmonte in "The Abduction From the 
Seraglio" and Ferrando in "Cosi Fan Tutte." He also was considered one of the 
world's foremost Donizetti bel canto tenors. 
</P>
<P>
He trained at the Cincinnati Conservatory after premedical studies at Duke 
University and service with the U.S. Air Force. His most influential teacher 
was baritone Robert Weede. In 1952, he made his debut as Faust with the 
Cincinnati Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, he joined the New York City Opera as Alfredo in "La 
Traviata." In 1961, he made his Metropolitan debut as Ferrando. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander considered his family life as important as his professional one and 
continued to sing at his neighborhood church in Manhasset, N.Y., years after 
establishing himself at the Met. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said he was not a seeker of stardom. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Times music critic Martin Bernheimer said: "Alexander bore several 
curses with grace. He was too versatile, too reliable, too even-tempered and, 
perhaps, too American to achieve the international renown he deserved. 
Audiences and impresarios tended to take him for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"Possessing a superb technique and an extraordinary range, he was . . . 
especially impressive in the high-lying, heroic music of Bacchus in Richard 
Strauss' 'Ariadne auf Naxos.' He might have made a big career just 
concentrating on the hard-to-cast middleweight roles of the German repertory." 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Alexander had returned to Cincinnati, where he lived with his 
wife, Sue.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
GOOD NEIGHBORS COME IN ALL SHAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
None too soon, Share Our Selves on Thursday will reopen its food, clothing and 
financial assistance program at new quarters in Costa Mesa. The 20-year-old 
charity -- Orange County's largest -- shut down those services last June when 
it was evicted from the city's Rea Community Center under pressure from 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, thousands who have nowhere else to turn have been deprived of help 
while SOS found and refurbished a new home. 
</P>
<P>
SOS will now be in an industrialized part of the city, but there are businesses 
and homes nearby. Fearing the worst, some area residents have already objected, 
and more complaints are expected once the operation gets under way. 
</P>
<P>
While the concerns of neighbors are understandable, compassion and patience are 
in order. The people who come to SOS for assistance do so because they have 
nowhere else to turn. Hundreds of families can feed and clothe their children 
or keep a roof over their heads because SOS is there. The poor are entitled to 
be treated with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
It's also incumbent upon SOS to be a good neighbor. That means listening and 
responding to complaints from neighbors and working with the community to 
minimize the impact of the clients who come there for help. The new location is 
a chance to start over, and we wish the agency a long and successful run.

Herbert Goffstein, the 63-year-old chief executive and co-founder of Mail Boxes 
Coast to Coast Inc., resigned last week from the Glendale-based franchiser. 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes Coast to Coast is the largest developer of franchises for Mail Boxes 
Etc., a San Diego-based chain of 1,400 postal service stores that Goffstein 
also co-founded. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, founded in 1984, focuses on the Los Angeles County and New York City 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Goffstein, who spearheaded Mail Boxes' New York expansion and who continues to 
own nearly 20% of its stock, said he resigned "to start taking it easier" and 
to return to Southern California. He said his departure will save Mail Boxes 
nearly $200,000 a year in salary and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
That savings, together with the recent sale of certain Mail Boxes franchise 
networks in New York, "will substantially ease the company's liquidity position 
and posture the company . . . to achieve an operational profit," President Gary 
M. Williams said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
In the nine months that ended Sept. 30, MBCC earned $81,199 on revenue of 
$592,652, compared with a loss of $517,420 on revenue of $397,181 a year 
earlier. Much of the latest profit stemmed from Mail Boxes sale of its Long 
Island, Brooklyn and Staten Island franchises in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The sale helped Mail Boxes cut its marketing costs and reduce its long-term 
debt from about $350,000 to less than $36,000.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: QUANTUM FUND BUYS 25% OF AUTOFINANCE GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quantum Fund N.V., an investment concern controlled by renowned New York money 
manager George Soros, has acquired 25% of AutoFinance Group Inc., a Burbank 
company that funds consumer auto loans for car dealers in California and New 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Quantum, a Dutch-based fund that has about $2 billion in assets, bought the 
1.67 million shares from AutoFinance for $5 million cash, or $2.99 a share. 
</P>
<P>
AutoFinance's stock, which is listed on the Boston Stock Exchange, lately has 
traded at $3.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said Quantum now has the right to elect two people to 
AutoFinance's board of directors, which currently has 10 members. 
</P>
<P>
AutoFinance was started in June, 1988, and last August it merged with 
Vitalmetrics, a San Diego shell company, said Blair Nance, AutoFinance's chief 
financial officer. AutoFinance approached Quantum Fund about making the 
investment to help provide the cash that AutoFinance needs for next year, he 
said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: MORTGAGE &amp; REALTY TRUST BANKRUPTCY REVIEW SLATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust, a Burbank real estate investment trust that filed 
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, said its final reorganization 
plan is to be reviewed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its plan calls for payment in full to all creditors within 4 
1/2 years, with interest at an initial rate of prime plus 1%, increasing by 
one-quarter of a percentage point every six months. The company said the plan 
has been approved by creditors and shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Mortgage &amp; Realty said it was forced to seek bankruptcy protection after 
the Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating agency downgraded its credit, which 
caused it to miss $105 million in debt payments due in March.

* Techno-nationalism is the practice of using technology as a tool of national 
power in global economic competition, either by trying to withhold 
technological knowledge from other states or by wielding it aggressively as an 
economic weapon. 
</P>
<P>
* Techno-globalism, in contrast to techno-nationalism, is the concept of 
sharing technology freely across borders and perhaps even cooperating in the 
development and manufacture of new products. 
</P>
<P>
* Multipolar describes a world in which global power is diffused among many 
countries, in contrast to the bipolar structure of the Cold War where the 
United States and the Soviet Union served as poles of international power. In 
the multipolar world ahead, experts say, alliances between states are likely to 
shift more rapidly than they did during the Cold War.

BENEATH TALK OF A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH U.S., SERIOUS TENSIONS GROW; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICIALS IN BOTH NATIONS WARN THAT THE RELATIONSHIP MAY BE HEADED FOR ITS 
WORST CRISIS SINCE WORLD WAR II. A RECENT POLL OF JAPANESE TEEN-AGERS LISTED 
THE UNITED STATES AS A GREATER WAR THREAT THAN THE SOVIETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TOKYO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last spring, an unusual series of adult comic books called "The Silent Service" 
turned into a minor best seller on Japan's big-city newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
The reason was its daring story line: "The Silent Service" was the saga of a 
Japanese navy submarine crew that obtains nuclear missiles, provokes a 
confrontation with the United States and declares "a war for Japan's true 
independence." 
</P>
<P>
No one in Japan took the story seriously, but it seemed to connect with a 
growing mood of Japanese nationalism -- and anti-Americanism -- that has both 
U.S. and Japanese officials worried. 
</P>
<P>
"There is anti-American emotion under the surface here," says Atsuyuki Sassa, a 
former national security adviser to several Japanese prime ministers. "If 
there's a real crisis, an isolation of Japan, then all of a sudden a new 
conservative nationalist party will arise. . . . We have no military capability 
now. But if we are pushed around, we can't stop the rise of nationalism." 
</P>
<P>
A Wall Street Journal poll found that more Japanese teen-agers listed the 
United States as their country's most likely enemy in war than cited the Soviet 
Union (30% named the United States, only 23% the Soviet Union). 
</P>
<P>
The developments are worrisome by any measure. Few countries are as closely 
linked as the United States and Japan. Half a century after World War II, 
Americans and Japanese buy each other's products, invest in each other's 
securities and even admire each other's culture; UCLA sweat shirts are as 
ubiquitous in Tokyo as sushi is in Westwood. Yet underneath, a subtle and 
dangerous resentment festers on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, while U.S. and Japanese officials talk publicly of a vibrant "new 
partnership" between their countries, they privately warn that the relationship 
may be heading for its worst crisis since -- well -- 1941. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the one relationship that is as important to us as the Soviet Union or 
Germany -- only, unlike those two, we haven't been able to move ahead," a 
senior State Department official says. "It's been a real disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, over the past 18 months the U.S.-Japanese relationship has seemed to 
grow increasingly sour. It is as if the two countries are discovering that the 
only glue that bound them together for 40 years was a shared fear of the Soviet 
Union, and now, with that gone, they have little else in common. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Americans understand Japan at all," confesses a senior U.S. 
official in Washington. "I think it is too early to say what kind of society 
now exists in Japan -- and how much of it is traditional, how much it has 
sincerely been changed by the experience from 1945 on, whether it is truly a 
democracy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the way the system in fact operates, you can read about the 
Japanese political system in the 1920s -- kind of an oligarchical system with 
power groups sharing and arranging things -- and it's not all that different. 
In the past, it led Japan in very dangerous directions. I don't anticipate (a 
rebirth of U.S.-Japanese hostility). But . . . I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese diplomat agrees about the gulf separating the two peoples. "I was 
talking with one of our negotiators the other day," he says, referring to the 
latest round of U.S.-Japan trade talks. "He said the people on our side despise 
the people on your side. They don't have any respect for them. They say, 'We're 
talking in terms of 20 years, but the Americans think only of today.' " 
</P>
<P>
Americans and Japanese have long criticized each other's policies, but now they 
are beginning to criticize each other's way of life -- a breach of far deeper 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are increasingly accepting the arguments of the Japan scholars known 
as "revisionists," who charge that Japan's political and social structure are 
so different from America's that they will never play "fair" by U.S. standards. 
Japanese are increasingly listening to nationalists who argue that American 
criticism is unjustified carping -- and that it is Japan, not the United 
States, that has been making too many concessions. 
</P>
<P>
A tone of mutual dislike has crept into the two countries' endless dialogue; 
Americans and Japanese are beginning to use language about each other that they 
would never use to describe other allies -- say, Britain or Germany. 
</P>
<P>
When the United States complained about Japanese trade practices, for example, 
a leading opposition member of Parliament, Masao Kunihiro, sneered that his 
colleagues viewed the U.S. protests as "the whining of a crybaby." And when 
Japan's first offer of aid to the military deployment in the Persian Gulf was a 
disappointing $1 billion, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) denounced it as 
"contemptible tokenism." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem may be that the two countries share a set of mirror-image 
anxieties. Americans are upset about the idea of Japan surpassing the United 
States in economic strength and political clout. Surprisingly enough, many 
Japanese are too. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be No. 1," confesses Hideaki Kase, a prominent Japanese 
nationalist. "We want to stay in the back seat, because it's much more 
comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Japan liked the Cold War, it turns out. The old balance of terror gave the 
country a secure and stable role as an economic powerhouse that didn't have to 
spend much time -- or, until recently, money -- on international political 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-Soviet confrontation was in our national interest," says Sassa, the 
former national security adviser. "The rapprochement of the two countries makes 
our position very awkward. . . . All of a sudden, we're the pacesetter, and we 
don't know how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Also, as formidable as Japan looks from afar, the island nation is driven by 
doubts about its future and haunted by a sense that disaster may lurk down the 
road. Along with the wealth that has made Tokyo throb with power and glitz have 
come worries about a stock market crash, a puncturing of the outsize "bubble" 
in the real estate market and the nagging fear that Japan's long boom might 
somehow be coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"I am inclined to believe that Japan has reached its peak in terms of material 
affluence," Kunihiro says. "We are losing our work ethic. Young people today 
are long on hedonism and short on industriousness." Such pessimism makes Japan 
reluctant to make concessions on issues such as trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Deep in our psyche is . . . anxiety that we are weak, that we can be 
persecuted by the white Christians," Kase says. "U.S. trade pressure, if we 
begin to suffer economically, will be seen as a threat here." 
</P>
<P>
As trade frictions increase, predicts State Department strategic analyst 
Michael Vlahos, "the Japanese will declare their national sovereignty 
threatened . . . at the very time they are coming to believe that Japan need 
not look to anyone else for (its) security." 
</P>
<P>
Nationalism is probably only natural in a country that is widely considered the 
world's greatest economic success, in part because of its people's 
industriousness and management genius. But many Japanese seem a bit frightened 
of their own nationalistic bent, as if they fear a return of the authoritarian 
militarism that led the country into World War II. 
</P>
<P>
That fear, only just below the surface, helps explain the fury of the Japanese 
popular protests against Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's abortive proposal to 
send Japanese troops to the Persian Gulf. The Japanese armed forces -- 
constitutionally known as the "Self-Defense Forces" -- pushed discreetly for 
what would have been their first deployment outside Japan since the end of 
World War II. But a wide range of public opinion decisively rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Some Americans share those fears. Earlier this year, the commander of U.S. 
Marines on Okinawa, Maj. Gen. Henry C. Stackpole III, indiscreetly described 
his mission as keeping Japan's impulses toward militarism under control. "No 
one wants a rearmed, resurgent Japan," he says. "So we are a cap in the bottle, 
if you will." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is a significant and growing lobby in favor of a larger military 
force. One member is former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who commissioned 
studies while in office on whether Japan should have an independent nuclear 
force. Unless the restrictions on its military power are eased, Nakasone says, 
"Japan cannot survive in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Hiroomi Kurisu, a former chairman of Japan's joint chiefs of staff, 
agrees, noting that Japan's economic machine depends increasingly on 
manufacturing plants in the neighboring countries of Southeast Asia. "Japan 
needs the power to protect Japanese interests in these countries," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Japan has already quietly built a significant military force. Its navy 
already boasts the largest surface fleet in the Far East, the third-largest in 
the world. When the yen is high on the foreign exchange markets, Tokyo's 
defense budget ranks as the third-largest in the world -- outstripped only by 
those of the United States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The government does its best to keep the new military might -- and the spirit 
accompanying it -- out of sight. A reporter's request to visit the huge naval 
base at Yokohama was turned down with the excuse that no ships were in port; in 
fact, two ships, the escort Katori and the training ship Shirane, were happily 
welcoming the Japanese public up the gangplank for tours. 
</P>
<P>
But the Defense Agency's proffered substitute -- a visit to an air force 
transport base near Tokyo -- proved equally revealing. There wasn't a combat 
plane in sight -- as the Defense Agency no doubt intended. But in the lobby of 
the unit's headquarters stood a striking, heroic statue: the figure of a World 
War II Japanese pilot returning from a successful mission, leather flight cap 
in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans ordered it destroyed at the end of the war," said air force 
spokesman Ben Kobayashi. "But the villagers buried it instead, and after the 
Americans left, they dug it up."

SPECIAL REPORT: SEEKING A NEW WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
NOTES ON THE CURRENT STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OF POPULATION 
</P>
<P>
There are currently an estimated 5.3 billion people on the planet, with the 
number expected to grow at an annual rate of about 1.5% throughout the 1990s, 
according to the World Bank. That means the world population will top 6 billion 
near the end of the decade. Even though the growth rate is expected to slow 
down after that, another billion will probably be added before the year 2010. 
The fastest population growth is in those countries least capable economically 
of sustaining it. By 2025, the percentage of humanity living in less-developed 
nations will rise from 1985's 75.7% to 84.1%. 
</P>
<P>
OF QUALITY LIVING 
</P>
<P>
The Population Crisis Committee, a Washington-based think tank, recently rated 
the quality of life in the world's 100 largest metropolitan areas. Based on 
such indicators as infant mortality, air quality, traffic flow, public safety, 
education, communications, food costs and living space, the group rated 
Melbourne, Australia, Montreal, and Seattle as the world's most livable urban 
environments. At the bottom of the list: Lagos, Nigeria; Kinshasa, Zaire; 
Kanpur, India; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Recife, Brazil. Los Angeles was ranked 
16th, with a "good" quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
Despite dramatic reforms in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and South Africa, 
thousands of people were arrested, tortured and killed last year by governments 
trying to suppress ethnic and nationalist tensions, Amnesty International said 
in its 1990 report. The London-based human rights group said that in countries 
like Ethiopia, Myanmar (formerly Burma), Somalia and Sudan, long-standing 
ethnic tensions have erupted in sweeping attacks on peasants in opposition 
areas or killings based solely on ethnic origin. 
</P>
<P>
OF THE ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
<P>
Among global environmental problems, depletion of the ozone layer, 
deforestation and global warming appear to be at the top of the political 
agenda at the moment. Brazil is to host a U.N. Conference on Environment and 
Development in 1992, with the aim of building on two existing agreements: the 
1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the 1985 
Convention on Protection of the Ozone Layer. The goal of the 1992 conference is 
to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions, promote energy efficiency and reduce the 
pace of deforestation. 
</P>
<P>
OF ECONOMICS 
</P>
<P>
With its goal of establishing a single European market by the end of 1992, the 
European Community will become an economic powerhouse second -- barely -- only 
to the United States. Its 12 member countries have a collective gross national 
product of $4.8 trillion. They are: Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, 
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
OF NUCLEAR ARMS 
</P>
<P>
There are five acknowledged nuclear weapons states: The United States, Britain, 
Soviet Union, France and China. In addition, India has also detonated a nuclear 
device. Israel is believed to have manufactured nuclear weapons. Top officials 
in both South Africa and Pakistan have stated publicly that their countries 
have "the capability" to make nuclear weapons should they desire to do so. 
Iraq's nuclear capabilities have been debated. In 1981, Israel stalled Iraq's 
nuclear program when it bombed a nuclear reactor under construction outside 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
OF TRAVEL 
</P>
<P>
This year, the U.S. State Department issued warnings or advisories urging 
caution or restricting travel to 52 countries. They include: Bangladesh, 
Bolivia, Burma, Chad, Chile, China, Colombia, Cyprus, Ecuador, El Salvador, 
Gabon, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kenya, 
Liberia, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nepal, Nicaragua, Northern Ireland, Pakistan, 
Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa, Soviet Union, Sri 
Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Vietnam, Yemen, Yugoslavia, Zaire, 
Zambia, Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
OF FOREIGN AID 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Agency for International Development, the primary 
recipients of U.S. foreign aid in 1989 were Israel, $1.2 billion; Sub-Saharan 
Africa, $1.053 billion; Egypt, $968 million; Philippines, $389 million; 
Pakistan, $352 million; El Salvador, $308 million; Bangladesh, $180 million; 
Guatemala, $147 million; Costa Rica, $122 million; Jamaica, $115 million; 
Morocco, $93 million. 
</P>
<P>
OF LITERACY 
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics issued by the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization showed that 25% of the world's population over the age of 15 is 
illiterate. It is believed that as many as 1 billion people in the world cannot 
read or write. In the 42 countries listed by the United Nations as the least 
developed in the world, most people are illiterate. Illiteracy is also a 
problem in developed nations. Surveys indicate that between 10% and 20% of the 
people in various industrial nations are illiterate.

SPECIAL REPORT: SEEKING A NEW WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
THE YEAR 2010: A VIEW FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the turn of the millennium approaching and the end of the Cold War 
remaking the map, governments around the world have sent scholars to their 
crystal balls. Most of the resulting reports have been unmemorable -- but one 
provocative forecast has come from the U.S. State Department. Written by 
Michael Vlahos, director of the department's Center for the Study of Foreign 
Affairs, it offers some predictions for the next 20 years: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
* A global power balance is dominated by three world powers: the United 
States/Canada, the European Community and Japan. The main concern for U.S. 
foreign policy becomes the economic and political challenge posed by the EC and 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
* The decomposition of the Soviet Union continues through the 1990s. Most of 
the non-Slavic republics gain independence, and a new federation dominated by 
Russia, the Ukraine and Byelorussia emerges around 2010. Its gross national 
product and production technology will be roughly equivalent to those of India 
and China. 
</P>
<P>
* The European Community progresses steadily but slowly toward complete 
economic integration and political confederation. The Eastern European 
economies will be absorbed and dominated by the Continent's strongest financial 
power, the new Germany. The Soviets, too, will rely on German financing to stay 
afloat. By 2010, most American military forces are withdrawn from the 
Continent. 
</P>
<P>
* East Asia becomes a cockpit of competition, not integration. A decline in 
U.S. ability and willingness to maintain large military forces across the 
Pacific, plus the growing strength of Asian countries' own armies, will 
gradually end America's role as the referee of East Asian affairs. A united 
Korea emerges as Japan's most aggressive competitor. Japan's relations with its 
neighbors become touchy. 
</P>
<P>
* The United States reassesses its role in the world and its domestic political 
system. In the wake of the Cold War and amid a widespread perception that the 
federal government isn't working, domestic politics turns to the job of 
renewing the American system. Party realignment follows. The U.S. world role 
turns somewhat more isolationist, under a doctrine of "selective engagement" 
that avoids long-term commitments like those of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
* The political use of military force declines. Production technology is seen 
increasingly as the new yardstick of world power, replacing the traditional 
measures of heavy ground forces and nuclear arsenals. But the world powers do 
continue to deploy military forces, concentrating their interest on the oceans 
-- and outer space. NATO gradually recedes in importance; Western Europe 
becomes an autonomous military power. 
</P>
<P>
* Regional conflicts and instability continue. The United States, Japan and the 
Western Europeans attempt to maintain world stability through joint action, but 
the United States finds itself increasingly at odds with the others as the 
stakes in the global economic competition grow. Major regional issues may 
escalate as the world powers assist different sides. Potential clashes among 
China, India and the Soviet Union could threaten other powers' interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Are President Bush's advisers using this as a blueprint? "I don't think so," 
Vlahos laughs. "They haven't had time to read it. They've been completely 
caught up in the events of the moment." On the other hand, the Soviet Embassy 
in Washington took four copies.

GIMME REWRITE: "I am not a journalist," says John Wayne Airport Manager Jan 
Mittermeier, above, but there's her article in the current California County, 
the magazine for county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
It's the rosiest account yet of the how the airport's "state of the art," 
"absolutely distinctive" new "dream terminal" was built. . . . The article 
reports the project's cost without mentioning it was nearly $20 million over 
original estimates. No mention either of bitter disputes with the contractor 
that delayed opening day for five months. "I thought someone would like to see 
something positive for a change," she said. Eric Bailey and Jeffrey A. Perlman

PUN POWER: Meanwhile, over on I-5, the latest weapon against congestion is a 
jar of Knott's boysenberry jam. . . . At the transit district's request, 
Knott's donated 600 1.3-ounce jars, which were relabeled "I-5 Traffic Jam" and 
sent them to transportation coordinators at the county's larger companies. 
"Help the I-5 out of a jam. Rideshare," says the accompanying card. . . . The 
idea is to promote the district's new offer of free gasoline to I-5 
car-poolers, and initial reaction has been good, a spokeswoman says. Eric

KEEPING WATCH: The surveillance cameras going up on the San Diego Freeway in 
Irvine will be watching for car-pool lane violations, but no one's going to get 
a ticket, says Caltrans. It's to test the experimental design of the car-pool 
lanes between Jeffrey Road and Irvine Center Drive. . . . Along that stretch, a 
"buffer lane" allows motorists to ease between the car-pool and regular lanes. 
It's the only such design in the nation so far. Eric Bailey and Jeffrey A.

OCTC APPROVES $85-MILLION RAIL EXPANSION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Commuter trains may soon be pulling out of the station every 25 to 30 minutes 
during morning and evening rush hours under an ambitious, $85-million plan 
approved Monday by transportation planners. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission voted 6 to 0 to add eight commuter 
rail round trips between Oceanside and Los Angeles to the one currently 
offered, and to open four new stations in the county. Amtrak also operates 
eight round trips between Los Angeles and San Diego, with a ninth to be added 
next year. The commission's action Monday brings to 18 the number of round 
trips that will be running through Orange County by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The county's commuter rail service is one piece of what is expected to be a 
regional network. When completed, the network will allow passengers to ride for 
hundreds of miles over Southern California, using transfers to travel between 
places such as Riverside and Irvine, San Bernardino and Pasadena, Fullerton and 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ecstatic," Commission Chairman Dana W. Reed said after the vote Monday. 
"This is absolute proof that we're going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
To get the program going, the commission will invest $13.2 million in six new 
locomotives, $31.2 million in 24 rail coaches, $27.6 million in double-tracking 
the rail line between Fullerton and Mission Viejo, and $5 million in new 
stations. The money is expected to come from state rail bond measures and from 
Measure M, the half-cent county sales tax that takes effect April 1. 
</P>
<P>
The panel voted Monday to borrow $100 million against future revenue from 
Measure M to expedite the commuter rail program and four other traffic 
improvement projects. Those projects are car-pool lanes on the Orange Freeway; 
design work for remodeling the El Toro "Y"; improvements to Beach Boulevard, 
and purchase of right of way for future rail transit. 
</P>
<P>
Under the OCTC rail plan, first unveiled in September, train service would be 
most frequent for northbound trains in the morning and southbound trains in the 
evening. For example, morning trains bound for Los Angeles would stop in Santa 
Ana at 6:03, 6:28, 6:48, 7:02, 7:38, 8:02 and 10:48. During the evening rush 
hour, southbound trains would leave Los Angeles' Union Station at 5:20, 5:45, 
6:20, 6:45 and 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
New stations are envisioned for Buena Park, Orange, northern Irvine or Tustin 
and either Mission Viejo or Laguna Niguel. Amtrak trains will not stop at these 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote Monday, OCTC Executive Director Stanley T. Oftelie was asked to 
reassure the panel that funds would be found to run the trains, because fares 
will not cover the operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
Oftelie said he is formulating a plan to use interest earned on existing 
transportation funds to set up a rail service endowment. Although that may take 
money away from some street improvement projects, Reed said it would be a "good 
trade-off." 
</P>
<P>
"Emphasis in Southern California on mass transit is going up, not down," Reed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If Oftelie is successful in creating a rail service endowment fund, Orange 
County would leap ahead of other counties in the heated competition for state 
rail bond money because only counties that have identified sources of operating 
funds can even apply for the bond proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Officials cautioned, however, that the planned spending spree for rail 
improvements will raise ridership only gradually and will not solve traffic 
problems overnight. 
</P>
<P>
An OCTC staff report estimates that total daily rail ridership could total 
10,300 boardings per day by 1995, of which between 3,800 and 5,700 would be 
generated by the OCTC's planned expansion of commuter service and most of the 
rest by Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
OCTC officials acknowledged, however, that the ridership projections could be 
too optimistic. They said they are hoping for a 40% recovery of costs from fare 
box revenues but that this may not be possible until there is a regional 
network of commuter trains linking neighboring counties. 
</P>
<P>
OCTC is in the train business in part because Amtrak is forbidden by Congress 
to offer intracounty service with frequent stops. However, Amtrak is permitted 
to operate the commuter service for the county. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to borrow against future Measure M proceeds came after weeks of 
intense lobbying by bond underwriters seeking OCTC's business. One OCTC 
official said the commission had never been visited by "so many $1,000 suits." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. was named the senior managing underwriter, 
with Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs providing backup. Eleven firms bid on 
the contract 
</P>
<P>
Kidder Peabody donated $5,000 to the Measure M campaign. Both the firm and OCTC 
officials said the contribution played no role in the selection process. 
Goldman Sachs also donated $5,000 to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, according to James Martling, a senior vice president at Kidder Peabody 
in San Francisco, Kidder Peabody underwrote a $50-million bond issue for 
Alameda County after voters there approved a sales tax for transportation 
projects. The firm handled a $200-million offering for Santa Clara County under 
similar circumstances in 1986, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMUTER RAIL PLAN 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission approved a plan to greatly expand 
commuter rail service between Los Angeles and Oceanside. In addition to adding 
eight round trips to the schedule, the plan calls for building four new 
stations in Orange County and two in Los Angeles County. The new Orange County 
stations would be in Buena Park, Orange, Tustin or north Irvine, and Mission 
Viejo or Laguna Niguel. Los Angeles County would pay for new stations in 
Commerce and Norwalk.

SUPERVISORIAL ELECTION; 
</P>
<P>
HIGH COURT CLEARS WAY FOR VOTE IN 1ST DISTRICT 
</P>

<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for a Jan. 22 election that is 
expected to place the first Latino on the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors this century, and civil rights attorneys declared that they believe 
the historic redistricting case is now over. 
</P>
<P>
The justices denied a request by the county to postpone the election in the new 
1st District, carved by a federal judge who ruled that the supervisors had 
discriminated against the county's 3 million Latinos in drawing district 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The high court did not say whether it will review the lower court rulings that 
led to the drafting of a new political map for the nation's most populous 
county. The new map changes representation for many of the county's 8.5 million 
residents and threatens to end a decade of conservative control of the board. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union and the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which joined the U.S. 
Justice Department in filing the voting rights suit against the county, said 
they believe the ruling will bring the two-year legal battle to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"It is over," declared ACLU lawyer Mark Rosenbaum. "It will forever be the 
legacy of this board that it stubbornly refused to budge from the wrong side of 
history." 
</P>
<P>
Antonia Hernandez, general counsel of MALDEF, said, "We believe that denying 
the county's motion for a stay indicates that there are not enough votes on the 
Supreme Court to hear this case. . . . It is a happy day for the Latino 
community." 
</P>
<P>
County attorneys refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, if the justices believe a case presents an issue worthy of being 
considered, they will issue a stay and block further action until they can rule 
on it. Court aides said that since the justices denied the county's request for 
a stay, they will likely also deny the appeal next month when it goes before a 
regularly scheduled conference of the court. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana, a member of the board's conservative majority, refused 
to concede defeat. "We still haven't heard whether they are going to review the 
whole thing," he said, acknowledging that the outlook for the county "certainly 
looks doubtful." Dana said he is preparing to begin representing his new 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The election was ordered last month by U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, who 
ruled in June that the supervisors had fragmented Latino neighborhoods to 
dilute their voting strength. Kenyon redrew district boundaries to create a 
new, predominantly Latino 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
The court decision was applauded by the four major Latino candidates in the 1st 
District -- state Sen. Charles M. Calderon; Sarah Flores, a former aide to 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum; Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina and 
state Sen. Art Torres. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, who finished first in the June primary in the old 1st District only to 
have the results thrown out by Kenyon, said she remains nervous about the same 
thing happening after the Jan. 22 election. "At least we have an election that 
is going to be completed, and that makes me happy," she said.

Dana defended the county's appeal, which has cost $6 million but could climb to 
$12 million if Kenyon awards attorney fees to the plaintiffs. A hearing will be 
held before Kenyon once the Supreme Court formally disposes of the case. 
</P>
<P>
"You should not have one district that has 40% more voters than any other 
district," Dana said. "That is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the county argued that the Constitution's "one-person, one-vote" 
requirement demands that districts be roughly equal in the number of voters, 
not just in the number of people living there. 
</P>
<P>
Because only 42% of adult Latinos in Los Angeles County are citizens and 
eligible to vote, the newly created district will have relatively few voters. 
While the 3rd, 4th and 5th districts will have nearly 1.1 million citizens 
eligible to vote, the 1st District will have slightly more than 700,000 
citizens and prospective voters. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, in Spain planning for the county's 1992 celebration 
of the 500th anniversary of Columbus' landing, issued a statement: "I am 
disappointed. It is ironic that Sarah Flores, who won the June primary, was 
denied the opportunity to be elected supervisor, while a male incumbent 
(Supervisor Ed Edelman) who won the June primary in the 3rd District will be 
allowed to serve a full four-year term representing hundreds of thousands of 
people who never voted for him." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
John Dunne, assistant attorney general for civil rights, was more cautious than 
the other plaintiffs in declaring that the case is over. 
</P>
<P>
"We're extremely gratified," he said. "This is the longest and most expensive 
trial in the history of the civil rights division." 
</P>
<P>
Yolanda Garza, an Arcadia resident on whose behalf the redistricting lawsuit 
was filed, said, "I feel like I got a free spin on the lottery, and it went all 
the way up to cashing in."

DRIFTER JUDGED SANE IN KILLING OF MENTAL HEALTH THERAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A Santa Monica Superior Court jury found Monday that a delusion-plagued 
homeless man was legally sane at the time he stabbed his therapist to death in 
a county mental health clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing for David Scott Smith, 27, could come as early as today but most 
likely will be postponed until early next year, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry 
Diamond, who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
Smith faces 26 years to life in prison for the Feb. 21, 1989, stabbing of 
Robbyn Panitch, a 36-year-old psychiatric social worker. If he had been ruled 
insane at the time of the killing, he would have been committed to a state 
mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased as punch," said a relieved Gloria Panitch, the victim's mother. 
She and her husband, Allan, maintained a front-row vigil inside the courtroom 
each day of the monthlong trial. 
</P>
<P>
The Panitches had said they feared Smith would be released in a couple of years 
if he were sent to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big relief (because) he'll be off the streets," Gloria Panitch said. 
"We won't have to worry about another killer out there." 
</P>
<P>
Ending 2 1/2 days of deliberation, the seven-man, five-woman jury determined 
that Smith was legally sane and could distinguish right from wrong when he 
repeatedly stabbed Panitch at a small, county-operated mental clinic in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The sanity verdict came in the second phase of Smith's trial. He was convicted 
of first-degree murder Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, told authorities he believed he was 
killing the "Antichrist." The slaying outraged the county's mental health 
community and led to calls for better security for counselors who work with 
increasing numbers of mentally disturbed transients. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's public defender, Carol Clem, had argued that the "delusions and demons" 
that tormented Smith robbed him of any capacity to understand that his actions 
were morally wrong. Two court-appointed psychiatrists testified that Smith was 
legally insane when he killed Panitch. 
</P>
<P>
But several jurors said Smith's behavior before the murder as well as 
statements he made to police, indicated he understood society's rules but chose 
not to follow them. 
</P>
<P>
While the jurors said they did not dispute that Smith is a paranoid 
schizophrenic, they decided that his ability to understand rules -- for 
example, he followed terms of probation from an earlier crime and sought help 
from authorities before killing Panitch -- showed he could distinguish right 
from wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Several jurors, who asked not to be named out of fear of Smith, said they 
focused on one of his statements in particular: "I thought I could get away 
with it," he told detectives after he was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
But they said the verdict of sanity was not easy to reach because Smith is 
clearly mentally ill. One juror said the issue almost deadlocked the panel. 
</P>
<P>
"He's messed up," the foreman, a Santa Monica engineer, said. "You can't draw a 
hard line against him. You have to have compassion. That's what made it 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Clem was not available for comment. She had voiced concern that the jury would 
rule against Smith out of sympathy for the victim and her family.

GRAND JURY BACKS GYPSUM CANYON AS AN OPTION FOR JAIL; 
</P>
<P>
ANNEXATION: THE REPORT SEEKS TO HEAD OFF QUICK ACTION ON LAND THAT MAY PRECLUDE 
THE BUILDING OF A COUNTY FACILITY. OPPONENTS OF THE PROPOSED STRUCTURE VIEW IT 
AS IRRELEVANT.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Grand Jury added its voice Monday to the clamor over jail 
overcrowding, suggesting that Anaheim be prevented from annexing a site in 
Gypsum Canyon until county supervisors finish debating whether to build a jail 
there. 
</P>
<P>
And in a related development, officials said Monday that they hope to hire 
prison expert Lawrence Grossman -- who has long monitored the county jails on 
behalf of a federal judge -- as a special county consultant. If approved by the 
Board of Supervisors next week, Grossman would advise the county on plans for a 
new jail and how to manage the facilities it already has. 
</P>
<P>
Both the proposal to appoint Grossman and the grand jury letter landed in the 
midst of a growing jail-related fury at the county Hall of Administration. 
Supervisors will consider several jail issues at their Dec. 18 meeting: They 
are expected to reaffirm their support for Gypsum Canyon, and to authorize the 
county staff to negotiate with the Irvine Co. on a price for the property. 
</P>
<P>
Executives with the company, which owns 2,500 acres in the canyon, have agreed 
to talk but say they have no intention of selling. 
</P>
<P>
While the county considers that site, Anaheim has moved to annex it, an action 
that would take it out of the county's reach and clear the way for construction 
of homes on the land. That prospect worries grand jurors, who wrote to 
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, in his capacity as chairman of the Local Agency 
Formation Commission, and urged that LAFCO delay the annexation. 
</P>
<P>
"The jurors are not saying that Gypsum Canyon is necessarily the place to build 
a jail," grand jury foreman Grant Baldwin said in an interview. "But they are 
very concerned about the problem of jail overcrowding, and they're concerned 
that an option not be removed." 
</P>
<P>
The letter, copies of which were sent to all the supervisors, touched off a 
flurry of interest by both sides, with supporters of the Gypsum Canyon jail 
cheering it and opponents dismissing it as irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter, a leading Gypsum Canyon jail opponent, noted that 
the city does not currently have an annexation proposal before LAFCO, which 
oversees such boundary issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that the grand jury letter has much significance," Hunter said. 
"It's really premature." 
</P>
<P>
But while Gypsum Canyon opponents downplayed the significance of the letter, 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said it would add to the chorus of voices joining 
the jail debate and could help advance the Gypsum Canyon plan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very significant sign that people are concerned, including very 
credible groups such as the grand jury," said Stanton, who supports the jail 
proposal. "If I were still on LAFCO, I certainly would be moved by the interest 
of the grand jury in this matter." 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time that they received the grand jury letter, supervisors 
were also hearing of a county staff proposal to hire Grossman. But where the 
grand jury suggestion prompted some debate, the Grossman appointment won only 
praise. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great deal of respect for Bud Grossman and the work he's done for the 
court," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman is a retired regional director of the federal prison system and once 
oversaw federal prisons in 14 western states. He has also worked as a warden in 
several federal prisons, and for the past several years has served as the 
special master of the Orange County jails. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman recently completed an inspection of the county jail system and 
strongly urged the supervisors to build a new jail in Gypsum Canyon. Citing 
what he called a "crisis" in jail overcrowding, Grossman wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"Time is money, and time is safety for the public. The authorities should begin 
at once to negotiate to acquire the Gypsum Canyon site." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his outspoken support for the controversial site, Grossman is still 
widely respected by officials on both sides of the jail debate. And officials 
agreed that he could add valuable insights as the county wrestles with the 
ever-growing problem. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman said he would gladly accept a job as a consultant to the county and 
said he would focus first on efforts to downscale the proposed Gypsum Canyon 
jail and make it more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I could help on that," he said. "I think that's a major task, but it 
can be done."

COLD FRONTS TO BRING ALONG A CHANCE OF RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you thought it was safe to classify rain as the stuff of local 
legend, two large cold fronts have begun rolling in from the north, bringing a 
chance of rain for a thirsty Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning tonight, Orange County residents can look to the skies for a 30% to 
40% chance of rain through noon Wednesday, according to meteorologist Steve 
Burback of WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
A cold front that Monday dumped showers on San Francisco is heading this way, 
causing overnight lows tonight to dip into the mid-40s and bringing a chance of 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
Highs today and Wednesday are expected to be in the mid-60s to 70. 
</P>
<P>
Drought-weary residents hoping for the Big One -- the Big Rain, that is -- to 
lift them out of their water-hungry blues will be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it'll be on the heavy side, except maybe up on the mountains on 
the western slopes," Burback said. "There's enough clouds that you'll get some 
moisture through Orange County, but on a scattered basis." 
</P>
<P>
Burback said another cold front -- part of the same storm system -- had 
appeared over northern Alaska on satellite photographs Monday afternoon, ready 
to travel the same southward route as its predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
The new front will arrive hard on the heels of the first one, whose showers 
should tail off by midday Wednesday. Burback also put Thursday night's chance 
of rain at 30% to 40% but said intermittent showers will probably come to an 
end by midday Friday. 
</P>
<P>
As with tonight's expected rain, northern Orange County residents are more 
likely than their southern counterparts to win the slight reprieve from the 
fourth unseasonably dry winter in a row.

VIOLENCE: YORBA LINDA OFFICIALS SAY GATHERINGS ARE MAGNETS FOR PROBLEMS.

City officials said Monday that they would consider a possible ordinance to 
outlaw admission charges for parties similar to the one that drew hundreds of 
rowdy revelers to a local neighborhood here last weekend and ended in the 
stabbing death of a Placentia man. 
</P>
<P>
"You can bet your last dollar that there will be considerable conversation 
about this," Councilman Gene Wisner said, referring to Saturday night's 
gathering in which guests were drawn to the 4900 block of Via del Cerro by 
flyers distributed at Esperanza High School. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Irwin M. Fried said he has already asked that the matter be placed 
on the agenda for the council's next meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A city ordinance, similar to one in Los Alamitos that bans admission charges at 
gatherings in residential zones, should be considered for Yorba Linda, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Alamitos ordinance, adopted last month after the stabbing death of a 
17-year-old party host, declared that charging admission to parties in 
residential areas creates situations that may lead to "danger to life and/or 
property." Violation of the ordinance is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of 
up to $500 or six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"This is terrible," Wisner said. "We will look around at other cities and see 
how they handle these things. Somehow, we can't allow this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Stout, 23, was fatally stabbed when a fight broke out at the Via del 
Cerro residence shortly after 8:30 p.m. Saturday. Richard Velasco, 19, of 
Anaheim was arrested Sunday and was being held on suspicion of murder Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The violence was apparently prompted when Stout and a second stabbing victim 
tried to remove Velasco from the party. 
</P>
<P>
The other victim, Steve Nicholas Lindsay, 17, of Yorba Linda suffered a stab 
wound to his arm. He was treated and released from a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco's aunt, Debbie Velasco, said her nephew had been invited to the party 
by the host to provide "security" and did not stab Stout. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the good guy," said Debbie Velasco, weeping in a telephone interview. 
"He was the one who was stopping the fight. He was the one who was trying to 
get the bad guys out." Velasco said her nephew was also assigned by the party's 
host to collect the admission charge. 
</P>
<P>
Police Detective Terry Fincher said officers were continuing to interview 
witnesses Monday, but "we have arrested one party that we're sure of." 
</P>
<P>
Police said that more than 200 people were drawn to the party by flyers 
advertising a $3 admission fee and other party attractions, including a beauty 
contest, assorted mixed drinks and three kegs of beer. 
</P>
<P>
Yorba Linda Mayor Mark Schwing said the weekend party already seemed in 
violation of laws prohibiting under-age drinking and the sale of alcoholic 
beverages to minors. But he said council discussion next week promises to be 
lively and is sure to include debate about the Los Alamitos ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a real problem with government interference into private lives," 
Schwing said. "But I have questions about where were those adults who are 
responsible for those teen-agers. It's very strange, very tragic." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Councilman Fried said, police have been generally successful in 
quelling disturbances at teen-age parties, "but the violence associated with 
the latest incident is very upsetting."

CITY WILL APPEAL $300,000 SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council Monday night authorized the city attorney to appeal a $300,000 
award to Ricky Patrick Miller, who was shot in the back by a Newport Beach 
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 28, was awarded $200,000 in compensatory damages and $100,000 in 
punitive damages against Newport Beach Police Officer Jun Payoyo in 
mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit stemmed from an incident in 1988 when Miller, a parolee from Texas 
who was then a Newport Beach limousine driver, was shot after a lengthy chase 
by police. He was left partially paralyzed by the shooting, which City Atty. 
Robert Burnham said was caused when Payoyo's gun accidentally discharged.

BUILDING CORDONED AFTER BULGE DEVELOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 68-year-old building at Pacific Coast Highway and Main Street in the downtown 
area was cordoned off from pedestrian traffic Monday after one of its brick 
walls started bulging outward. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said no bricks actually fell from the building, which houses 
Jack's Surfboards, and no one was hurt. But they said that because the 
structure looked as if a partial collapse might be possible, the sidewalk was 
sealed off by yellow tape. Two upstairs apartments in the two-story structure 
also were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what caused it," said Deputy Fire Marshal Dennis Groat. "We've 
closed the area off to protect people from possible injury." 
</P>
<P>
The surfboard shop is somewhat of a downtown landmark, located across the 
street from the municipal pier and visible to thousands of motorists who pass 
by on Pacific Coast Highway each day. The old building is opposite the gleaming 
new Pierside Pavilion, a complex of newly built shops, theaters and 
restaurants. Pierside Pavilion opened this year as part of the city's downtown 
renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Jack's Surfboards also is scheduled for some type of renewal, city officials 
said. They added that the bulging condition of the old brick building may now 
hasten a decision on whether to tear it down or try to restore it. Groat noted 
that the building, like most of the older structures in the downtown area, was 
not built to earthquake-safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Adams, city director of community development, was at the scene, surveying 
the possible hazard at 3 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like face bricks are hanging out further than they should, so we're 
going to double check and take all safety precautions," Adams said. "We're 
going to put a scaffolding up there tonight. We're going to get engineers in 
here the first thing on Tuesday morning and make sure the building is still 
structurally safe. We've also told the occupants of the two apartments (that 
were evacuated) not to stay there tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Adams said there had long been a slight curve in the Jack's Surfboards wall 
that faces Main Street. But he said the bow became a distinct bulge Monday 
afternoon, generating fears about the building's safety. The bottom floor of 
the building is used for the surfboard shop, and the apartments are on the 
upper floor. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said the downstairs surfboard business is being permitted to continue 
operation, but access to the store is limited to doors not near the bulging 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
"This building has always been scheduled to be part of downtown redevelopment," 
Adams said. He said no decision had been made whether to renovate the building 
to earthquake safety standards or to raze it and build a new structure. 
</P>
<P>
The building's owner, Mike Abdelmuti, said the building was constructed in 
1922, during the early heydays of the Huntington Beach oil boom. BILL BILLITER

STUDENTS DUCK SHOTS FIRED NEAR SCHOOL

Six students ran for cover as several shots were fired at them Monday near 
Louis Lake High School. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured and no arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said they believed the incident was gang related and that the 
students are gang members. The shooting occurred about 8:25 a.m. at Lake School 
Park, which adjoins the high school. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Tom Robins said that the six students had gone without permission to 
a convenience store in a nearby shopping center. Assistant Principal Larry 
O'Donnell had followed them and ordered them to return. 
</P>
<P>
As they were walking back to school, Robins said, his students had a "chance 
meeting with three youngsters from another gang. The youngsters shouted 
something at my students and they returned the insults," Robins said. 
</P>
<P>
The attackers got into a car and headed west on Orangewood Avenue, Robins said. 
Then the car stopped, one of its occupants got out, crouched and fired at the 
six students, who were about 40 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
"They were running and diving for cover," Robins said. "We're shocked but 
relieved that no one was hurt." 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell, who was in his car heading back to campus, said he heard the 
gunshots and saw the students "run in all directions." 
</P>
<P>
"After the gunman used up all the bullets, the students got up and shrugged as 
if to say, 'Hey, you missed us,' " O'Donnell said. "That's typical gang 
mentality." 
</P>
<P>
The gunman jumped into the car, which sped away west on Orangewood. O'Donnell 
said that he tried to chase the car to get its license number, but lost sight 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We were darned lucky that no one was hit," Robins said. "This is a quiet 
campus and we can do without gangs and shootings." DAVAN MAHARAJ

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GROUP BARRED FROM MALL SETTLES FOR $720,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pasadena citizens group that was barred in 1985 from collecting signatures at 
the Plaza Pasadena shopping mall has settled with the mall owner for $720,000. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the lawsuit, filed by Pasadena Citizens for Representative 
Government against the Hahn Co., was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The mall, one of 25 California malls managed by the firm, had refused to allow 
the group to collect signatures for a city initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, Hahn will pay the group's $640,000 legal fee and $80,000 
for community grants to be awarded later. The mall will allow political 
activities in five locations but can bar access 25 days a year and can prohibit 
solicitations. The new rules pertain only to the Pasadena mall and not to 
Hahn's other facilities.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $400 MILLION REGAINED FROM MARCOS, COURT 
TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Philippine government in Manila has garnered about $400 million in its 
effort to regain $5 billion allegedly looted from the country by the late 
dictator Ferdinand Marcos, his wife, Imelda, and their business associates, 
according to a ranking government official. 
</P>
<P>
David Castro, chairman of the Philippine Commission on Good Government, made 
the revelation during a Los Angeles federal court hearing Monday in which 
Imelda Marcos asserted that she had negotiated an end to a $5-billion fraud 
suit against her and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Castro disputed the contention, as did Alejandro Roces, publisher of a 
Philippine newspaper, who served as an intermediary in negotiations between 
Marcos and the government of President Corazon Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer said she would issue a ruling after she 
had received further answers to written questions that have been submitted to 
Aquino.

FAIR BOARD VOTES FOR NEW BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Fair Board last week approved its 1991 budget and voted to 
spend $6.5 million in reserve funds for a multipurpose building. 
</P>
<P>
The new structure will be near the Arlington Theater on North West Street, 
inside the fairgrounds complex in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Operating revenues for 1991 are expected to total more than $14.3 million, a 1% 
increase over 1990. Operating expenses for the upcoming season were estimated 
at $12.2 million, a 3% increase from the previous year. It is expected that 
operating net income for 1990 will total more than $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The new budget includes plans to spend 12% more on fair attractions, 13% more 
on exhibits, 12% more on administrative expenses and 37% less on equipment than 
1990.

MAY SUBPOENAED IN PROBE OF LOBBYIST

<P>
Former City Councilman Ron May and a city planning commissioner said Monday 
that they have been subpoenaed to appear Jan. 8 before the Orange County Grand 
Jury in connection with an investigation involving attorney and lobbyist 
Rodolfo Montejano. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury is apparently trying to determine if Montejano attempted to 
improperly influence city officials on at least two pieces of legislation that 
may have affected clients he represented. 
</P>
<P>
May, a Santa Ana high school teacher who was defeated in November by Councilman 
Robert L. Richardson, also appeared before the panel in September along with 
Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. Both men attended a dinner hosted by Montejano 
in July, 1989, just before the council voted to ban private uses of public 
parks. At the time, Montejano represented a promoter who was helping stage a 
concert in a park. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Planning Commissioner Donald A. Sizemore, May's campaign manager, 
will be making his first appearance before the panel. In an interview Monday, 
Sizemore said district attorney investigators have questioned him about a 
private dinner hosted by Montejano in December, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sizemore said he and May were invited by Montejano to the dinner at a Reuben's 
Restaurant to discuss whether the city Planning Commission and the council 
would approve construction of a series of oversize billboards being sought by a 
firm that the lobbyist represented. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron May and I told him that there was no possibility that the billboards would 
pass," Sizemore said. "There was no deal-cutting. These guys had the 
straightest word they could get that they were not getting any billboards 
passed." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the council and Planning Commission voted not to allow the 
billboards. 
</P>
<P>
May said Monday that he does not remember the dinner meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been so many damn dinner meetings. I don't know what's going on," May 
said. LILY ENG

COUNCIL TO DISCUSS TERM LIMITS, FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Mike Eggers saw two things he didn't like in last November's 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
One was a councilman in a neighboring city being elected to a fourth straight 
term. The other was a councilwoman spending more than $30,000 to win a seat. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Eggers has proposed two city ordinances he hopes will prevent 
those things from happening in Dana Point. One ordinance limits council members 
to two consecutive terms. The other would limit all campaign contributions to 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers says the two, which will be discussed tonight, are related. 
</P>
<P>
"The presence of incumbents in any election tends to drive up the costs," 
Eggers said. "I believe the time to put a cap on these things is right now." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to years of council service, Eggers contends, eight is enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Eight years is a long, long time," Eggers said. "If a councilman cannot get 
something done in that length of time, I think there is a major problem. 
Besides, I think any longer than that and you get stale." 
</P>
<P>
Seven other cities in the county have two-term limits. They are Cypress, 
Huntington Beach, Irvine, La Palma, Santa Ana, Seal Beach and Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers said his intent is not to remove anyone from office. But, he said, "by 
limiting consecutive service to two terms, we will open the door for new ideas 
and new leadership on the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
He also contends that the mere presence of incumbents in any race tends to 
inhibit others from entering. For example, San Juan Capistrano had not had a 
new face for a decade, he said. Then, when two incumbent councilmen decided not 
to run in November, 14 candidates jumped into the council race. 
</P>
<P>
One of those candidates who just left office, former San Juan Capistrano 
Councilman Phillip R. Schwartze, disagreed with Eggers' argument. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone is responsive to the voters, I don't think it matters how long he's 
been in there," Schwartze said. "If he's doing a dynamite job, he should stay 
on. If not, the voters can easily vote him out of office." 
</P>
<P>
But voting an incumbent out of office can be expensive, Eggers maintains. 
Incumbents can, and usually do, raise campaign money effectively, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are more inclined to give money to an incumbent than a challenger," he 
said. "Incumbents are known quantities." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo candidate Sue Withrow "took out a second mortgage on her house to 
raise funds," Eggers said. "I think that's getting out of hand. I'm proposing 
bringing these things back to reality." LEN HALL

'CRASHES' AROUND BIG A'S PARKING LOT SPELL GOODBY FOR MODEL PLANE PILOTS

John Mc Murray has an attitude about flying planes that would frighten even the 
most seasoned air traveler. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're afraid to crash or make mincemeat out of it, you shouldn't be out 
here flying," said Mc Murray, 66. "I've seen people come out here and lose one 
wing, and never come back again." 
</P>
<P>
Although they swoop and soar like the best contenders in a military flying 
show, Mc Murray's aircraft weigh but 4 to 6 pounds and fly at an altitude of 
about 200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Some 110 members belong to the 20-year-old Anaheim Model Flyers Assn., whose 
members use the airspace over the Anaheim Stadium parking lot when it's not 
being used for sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
At least three people are needed to fly the planes: a pilot; a spotter who 
stands near the pilot to keep track of the plane, and a pole guard, who 
monitors the plane so that it doesn't fly beyond the parameters of the parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this self-imposed policing system, the city recently gave the club six 
months to relocate after a plane crashed into an office building. No one was 
injured, but a window was broken. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't so much the frequency of the accidents that was the issue, but the 
potential severity of it," said Mark Deven, the city's recreation 
superintendent, who estimated that a plane crashes every couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone had been sitting in the office when that plexiglass window was 
broken, we could have been looking at a real problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The planes are controlled by radio and run on an alcohol-based fuel that Mc 
Murray said barely burns when the planes crash. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them have about 4-ounce tanks, and there's not enough in there to hurt 
anything. I've never seen an airplane burn," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With price tags between $200 and $10,000, the planes have wing spans up to 50 
inches. Their pilots range in age from teen-agers to an 80-year-old member, and 
all must be card-carrying members of the association. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Parks and Recreation Department has worked with the club since it 
was founded, helping members to keep their sport safe. But in March, the club 
must move from the stadium parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see the club go; it has a history here," Deven said. But the 
city's liability has increased over the past two decades as the areas around 
the stadium have become more congested. 
</P>
<P>
Mc Murray, a former pilot, said he isn't too worried about the future of 
model-plane flying in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been very nice to us," he said about the city. "It requires a fairly 
big place . . . but they've offered to help us relocate to another flying 
site." LISA MASCARO

STATION MILESTONE

<TEXT>
<P>
At the intersection of 7th and Flower streets downtown, work on a Metro Rail 
station has moved underground. Gone are the cranes, trucks, traffic 
interruptions and noise. 
</P>
<P>
Below street level, jackhammers still rattle away in semidarkness. Phase Two of 
the construction has workers installing plumbing, electrical systems, floors 
and walls for the station, called Metro Center. 
</P>
<P>
The job is scheduled to be completed and the station opened on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Metro Center will be a transfer point for the Blue and Red lines. The Blue Line 
is an above-ground, light-rail system already running between Long Beach and a 
station at Pico Boulevard and Flower Street, just south of downtown. It will 
dip underground from that point to the Metro Center terminus. 
</P>
<P>
The first segment of the Red Line, a subway, will run from Union Station to 
stops at 1st and Hill streets, 5th and Hill streets and Metro Center, then on 
to a station at Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street. It is scheduled to 
start operation in late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Metro Center has two vault-like levels, the Blue Line above and the Red Line 
beneath. When the Blue Line station opens, passengers will be shielded from the 
noise and dust of the Red Line construction. 
</P>
<P>
More than 52,000 cubic yards of concrete and 9 million pounds of steel were 
used to build the project, according to transportation officials. More than 
170,000 cubic yards of dirt were excavated. But at street level, the only sign 
of all that work will be three entrances.

PEOPLE: SPEED SKATING CHAMP DOESN'T REGRET ROLLING OUT OF THE GAME AT AGE 24 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six years ago Tom Peterson, a world champion speed roller-skater, announced his 
retirement from international competition. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, who lives in Huntington Beach, was recently inducted into the United 
States Amateur/Federation of Roller Skating Hall of Fame in Lincoln, Neb., and 
doesn't regret his decision to leave the sport at age 24. 
</P>
<P>
"That's old for roller-skaters in speed racing," said Peterson. "It's a 
physically and mentally demanding sport. It's for young people." 
</P>
<P>
After growing up as a self-professed "rink rat," Peterson captured seven world 
titles and won gold medals in the Pan American Games. In the early 1980s he was 
considered the top speed roller-skater in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson was a terror in indoor roller rinks in the United States and on the 
outdoor banked tracks in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"I never could stand losing," said Peterson, "but if I did everything I was 
supposed to in training, there was no way I could see myself losing. I didn't 
lose that many times." 
</P>
<P>
Now president of Hypro Co., Peterson heads a firm that manufactures 
roller-skating wheels in a Huntington Beach plant and sells them in 21 
countries. His built his first wood skate wheels when he was only 9 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his competitive days, Peterson remained an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of stars, and the people in our sport do it for the love of the 
sport," he said. "There was no money in it at all. Sometimes I was so broke and 
hungry I would eat the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great part of my life. I keep drawing back on all the experience I 
had traveling, the different cultures I was exposed to and the different people 
I met." However, like other amateur athletes, he was able to get help from 
sponsors who provided equipment and racing clothes. 
</P>
<P>
The part he doesn't miss is the eight hours of training on most days. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I do miss getting up on the line, hearing the gun and the race 
itself," he said. "I enjoyed it while I was doing it, but not the training." 
</P>
<P>
He won his first national roller-skating title at age 4 and continued to win 
his age category each year thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
But Peterson wasn't exactly a well-known name in athletic circles. 
</P>
<P>
"In my own skating circles I was a star," said Peterson, who liked to compete 
in 1,500 meter races as well as sprints and longer events. 
</P>
<P>
While there are 2,800 rinks in the United States with 40,000 registered 
skaters, Peterson acknowledges that speed skating doesn't enjoy much 
popularity, partly due to the negative image of Roller Derby. 
</P>
<P>
"Roller Derby is like all-star wrestling," he said. "It's just a bunch of hype. 
I don't think any of them can skate." 
</P>
<P>
But times are changing, and speed skating is coming into its own. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next Olympics, (hockey) roller-skating will be a demonstration event," 
said Peterson, who earlier represented roller-skating on the Athletic Advisory 
Council to the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is still able to get in shape to compete, he won't do so for the 
upcoming Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe someday I'll compete in the senior Olympics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Elizabeth A. Johnson, 37, had entered a contest, so her 
fifth-place finish was a good effort, considering it was a national 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo woman was awarded $250, and a photo of her re-creation of St. 
Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, made from gingerbread, candy and frosting, was 
printed in this month's edition of Good Housekeeping magazine, the contest 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
"From beginning to end it took me a full month to finish, and that included 
research at the library and the baking itself," said the full-time mother of 
four children. 
</P>
<P>
The competition bug has bitten her. "Next year I'm planning to make a castle 
out of gingerbread," she said.

BLOODHOUND LEADS DEPUTIES TO BANK ROBBERY SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
EL TORO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man who allegedly robbed a bank Monday afternoon was tracked down three hours 
later by a bloodhound and arrested, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sheriff's Lt. Larry Richey, Mikaele Luamanuvae, 31, of El Toro 
walked into the Bank of America branch at 22491 El Toro Road at about 3:30 
p.m., handed a note to a teller demanding money and fled with $1,040. 
</P>
<P>
No weapons were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Three hours later, a sheriff's helicopter located a brown 1977 Toyota believed 
used in the robbery at the Irvine Medical Center on Sand Canyon Avenue, Richey 
said. Deputies found the money in the car and then summoned Reserve Sgt. Larry 
Harris and his bloodhound Duchess. 
</P>
<P>
"The dog took a good sniff of the vehicle, went out of the parking lot, went 
into the medical center, went up three flights of stairs and went directly to 
the suspect," Richey said. "And when the suspect saw the dog and the officers, 
he gave himself up." 
</P>
<P>
Luamanuvae was booked into Orange County Jail on suspicion of robbery, Richey 
said, adding that it was not clear why the suspect had gone to the medical 
center.

A gunman held up three restaurant employees early Monday morning and stole 
several thousands dollars before fleeing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The employees, a busboy, manager and bartender, were unharmed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbery occurred shortly after midnight at El Torito Grill, 951 Newport 
Center Drive. The gunman entered the restaurant as the employees were preparing 
to close for the evening, Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
No patrons were in the restaurant at the time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman ordered the employees to the back of the restaurant and made them 
tie each other up, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber then fled with the day's receipts, estimated at several thousand 
dollars, Gonis said.

8 DAYS OF HANUKKAH BEGIN TONIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HOLIDAY STEMS FROM THE FACT THAT IT IS THE 
FIRST RECORDED FIGHT FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, A JEWISH SCHOLAR SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Thousands of Orange County Jews begin celebrating Hanukkah tonight, an 
eight-day festival that commemorates one of the earliest fights for religious 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, Jews celebrate the holiday at home by lighting candles each 
night on a candelabrum called a menorah, exchanging gifts, eating latkes, or 
potato pancakes, and teaching children a game played with a top. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday, also called the Festival of Lights, recognizes the victory of a 
small band of Israelites called the Maccabees over the ruling Syrians in the 
2nd Century BC. The Syrian king, Antiochus, had seized control of the temple in 
Jerusalem and desecrated it. When Judah Maccabee and his band emerged 
victorious, they cleansed and rededicated the temple and celebrated for eight 
days. 
</P>
<P>
According to legend, the holiday lasts eight days because of a miracle: when 
the Maccabees took back the temple, they had only enough oil to light the 
synagogue lamp for one day -- but it burned for eight days. 
</P>
<P>
Many religion scholars, however, discredit that story. The legend didn't appear 
in the Babylonian Talmud until 400 to 600 years after the Maccabean War, while 
more contemporary accounts in the first and second books of Maccabee make no 
mention of the so-called miracle. Instead, they say that the Jews celebrated 
for eight days because they had been unable to observe Sukkot -- another 
eight-day holiday -- during the war. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday probably has its roots in an ancient pagan holiday called 
Saturnalia, an eight-day festival of bonfires and gift-giving which was brought 
to the Middle East by Alexander the Great's army in the 4th Century BC, 
according to Rabbi Allen Krause of Temple Beth El in South Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"This holiday started because people thought the sun was losing power and they 
were being overwhelmed by the forces of darkness -- which explains why it took 
place at this time of year," said Krause, who also teaches religion at Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish religious leaders, unhappy that their people were observing a pagan 
holiday, "superimposed" the historical event of rededicating the temple in 165 
BC, Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred years later, the miracle-of-the-oil story was developed as an 
explanation for the holiday's eight-day duration. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice story, sort of a Santa Claus story," Krause said. "It represented 
God's great might, it became popular, and some people thought it was true." 
</P>
<P>
But Hanukkah's importance, Krause said, does not stem from the story of the 
miracle. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the reason we celebrate it," he said. "It was the first recorded 
fight for religious freedom, and it emphasizes how important it is for people 
to have freedom of worship. That's much more significant." 
</P>
<P>
Most synagogues and Jewish community groups will hold their main Hanukkah 
celebrations this weekend. The Jewish Community Center of South Orange County, 
for example, will hold its annual Hanukkah party on Sunday at 10 a.m. at 298 
Broadway in Laguna Beach. For reservations, call (714) 497-2070. 
</P>
<P>
Chabad of West Orange County, meanwhile, will present a "1990 Chanukah Live" 
show the same day at 5 p.m. at 5702 Clark Drive in Huntington Beach. For 
information or reservations, call (714) 846-2285.

<P>
A 16-year-old Norco boy was shot in the shoulder Monday during a freeway 
confrontation between the occupants of his car and the driver of a red 
Corvette, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified victim and two teen-age friends were apparently fired upon on 
the Artesia Freeway after they "exchanged finger gestures" with the man in the 
Corvette, Buena Park Police Sgt. Terry Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
Branum said investigators have not yet determined what sparked the shooting. 
The youths "haven't said much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 2:15 p.m. in the eastbound lanes near the Beach 
Boulevard off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, a passenger in the car, was shot in the shoulder by a bullet that 
penetrated the left, rear panel of the vehicle and was partially deflected by 
the youth's right hand, Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, the victim's friends pulled off the freeway and flagged 
down a motorcycle officer at the intersection of La Palma Avenue and Western 
Avenue in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded youth was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange where he was listed 
in stable condition, Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant was described as having dark hair and wearing dark clothes, 
driving a late model red Corvette with a cellular phone antenna on the back. 
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say, we don't have a whole lot to go on here," Branum said. 
Investigators have requested that anyone with information about the shooting 
call police at (714) 521-9352.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Esperanza's opponents have learned at their peril not to pass Reaves' way. In 
the Division III championship game Saturday night, St. Paul learned too late, 
and Reaves made the Swordsmen pay by intercepting two passes in a 25-7 victory. 
The two interceptions gave Reaves 11 for the season, which ties the 
single-season school record and is two shy of the county record shared by 
Reggie West of Santa Ana Valley (1975) and Steve Stocking of Pacifica (1978). 
Reaves had a 12th interception in his hands against St. Paul, but it was 
accidentally knocked away by a teammate. "He just plays a key, key role in our 
secondary," Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said. "He's won some big, big games for 
us." Most notable were Reaves' four interceptions -- one for a 69-yard 
touchdown -- against Westminster and his interception at the Aztecs' three-yard 
line in the final seconds of a 12-7 victory over Loara. 
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
Flavio Bernal, who scored five goals in Tustin's 7-2 soccer victory Tuesday 
over Laguna Beach in the Irvine tournament. Bernal scored another goal Friday 
to help Tustin defeat Trabuco Hills, 3-2, and advance to the consolation 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Son Ly, who was named the most valuable player of the Laguna Beach basketball 
tournament after scoring 23 points in Estan cia's 69-68 victory over Lynwood in 
the title game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Tomek Mikler, who kicked a 22-yard field goal with 18 seconds left in the 
Division II title game Saturday to give Capistrano Valley a 17-15 victory over 
Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
John Molle, who averaged 33 points while leading Irvine to the championship of 
the Tipoff Classic tournament. Molle scored 27 points in a 75-59 victory over 
Newport Harbor in the title game Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Whitby, who caught three passes for 96 yards and a touchdown and made a 
key interception in the fourth quarter to help Whittier Christian to a 34-21 
victory over Tehachapi in theDivision IX championship game Saturday.

GENERAL AUTOMATION PURCHASES RIGHTS TO 2 COMPUTER SYSTEMS 
</P>

<P>
General Automation Inc., an Anaheim-based computer company, said Monday that it 
has purchased the rights to sell two lines of computer systems from Motorola 
Inc. for $36 million. 
</P>
<P>
Under a multiyear agreement, Motorola Computer Group in Tempe, Ariz., will 
manufacture its Delta Series 3000 and Delta Series 8000 computers for General 
Automation, which will resell the computers to its own customers. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Mackenzie, General Automation's president, said the agreement 
strengthens a seven-year relationship between the company and Motorola. Under 
that deal, General Automation has been building minicomputers based on 
Motorola's family of microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
General Automation will customize the computers by enabling them to run the 
company's business software applications based on the Pick and Unix operating 
systems, the basic software that controls the execution of programs within a 
computer. Unix is a popular, easy-to-use system that can accommodate many users 
at one time; Pick is designed for running business software applications. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been extremely pleased with Motorola's products and cooperation," 
Mackenzie said. "Motorola continues to work with us to provide our company a 
clear picture of their current and future development programs." 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood King, vice president of sales for General Automation, said the company 
will continue to manufacture its own line of computers based on the Pick 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said the company saw a need to expand its line to include computers 
based on the Unix operating system. The easiest way to do that was to purchase 
the rights from Motorola, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Blossom, vice president of sales at Motorola's commercial products 
division in Cupertino, said General Automation can target customers in Europe 
and Asia with the computers purchased from Motorola. He said volume shipping 
will begin in January.

ALL CIVIL SUITS AGAINST OWNERS OF 2 THRIFTS SETTLED; 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L FAILURES: THE ACTIONS INVOLVED AMERICAN DIVERSIFIED SAVINGS BANK AND 
CONSOLIDATED SAVINGS BANK. CRIMINAL INQUIRIES ARE CONTINUING.

<P>
Federal regulators have settled all civil lawsuits, including claims of 
racketeering and fraud, against the former owners and operators of American 
Diversified Savings Bank and Consolidated Savings Bank, authorities said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI, however, is continuing separate criminal investigations of the two 
defunct Orange County thrifts, which failed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated Savings, which was based in Irvine, and American Diversified, 
which was based in Costa Mesa, were two of seven top priority cases among 
nearly three dozen bank fraud and embezzlement investigations in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties, according to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
American Diversified still holds the record for the biggest total refund to 
S&amp;L depositors. When the S&amp;L was closed in 1988, thrift regulators paid 
back $1.14 billion in insured deposits to account holders. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators settled all the civil actions pending with Consolidated Savings 
owner Robert A. Ferrante and American Diversified owners Ranbir S. Sahni and 
Lester Day, said John Thomas, a supervising attorney with the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the litigation -- in both state and federal courts in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties -- involving other directors and officers of the two 
institutions also was settled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreements, details of the settlements were not to be 
disclosed. Thomas said pieces of the litigation have been settled at various 
times, with most coming in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
In several lawsuits, the first of which were filed in 1986, Sahni was accused 
of racketeering, fraud, mismanagement, breaches of fiduciary duties and 
violations of banking laws and regulations. The accusations against him 
involved various real estate transactions, allegations of illegal kickbacks and 
allegations of improper bonuses to his president, Lester Day. Sahni, who owns 
96% of the defunct American Diversified, denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to forget it, put it behind me and go on with my life," Sahni said on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sahni, who is normally talkative, said he could not discuss the settlement. 
However, he said he hopes to continue working on real estate deals out of a 
Santa Ana office through his American Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate case, Ferrante was accused of racketeering, fraud and breaches of 
fiduciary duties and flagrant violations of state and federal banking laws and 
regulations relating to his actions at American Consolidated. The lawsuit, 
filed in 1986, accused him and others of wrongfully benefiting from a series of 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrante, who previously denied the allegations, could not be reached for 
comment. But his attorney said the Newport Beach developer was happy with the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"He's delighted (that) he's put the disputes behind him, and he's delighted he 
and regulators are focusing on what to do with Consolidated's major asset," 
said his attorney, Brian C. Lysaght of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
That asset, a 157-acre landfill in Carson once used as a hazardous waste dump, 
was one of the main causes for the thrift's downfall. Regulators said it was 
not worth the $9 million Consolidated Savings had loaned on the property. They 
ordered the thrift to devalue it to $6.2 million, Lysaght said. 
</P>
<P>
Under a court-approved reorganization plan for a Ferrante company in U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court, the FDIC as receiver for Consolidated Savings stands to get 
$29 million if the property can be developed into a shopping center-office 
complex, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrante put together a group of investors who will pay $47 million for the 
site, Lysaght said. The group already has turned over $3 million to pay for 
administrative expenses and an environmental study. The bankruptcy court will 
supervise the plan for four years. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the most successful receivership in (S&amp;L) history in the 
end," he said. Consolidated should get triple its money back, and all creditors 
should get repaid in full, he said. Ferrante, as owner of the defunct thrift, 
may even get some of his equity back. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, though, regulators are estimating that Consolidated Savings will 
cost U.S. taxpayers about $43 million once its assets are totally liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
American Diversified, on the other hand, will cost taxpayers $798 million after 
regulators sell all of its assets, according to regulators. 
</P>
<P>
At the thrift, Sahni had set up a complex business involving non-traditional 
S&amp;L investments such as real estate syndications, wind-turbine farms and 
electronic pagers. Regulators said he kept most things in his head, forcing 
them to hire a legion of lawyers to unravel the organization to determine who 
owned what and to prepare the lawsuits against Sahni. 
</P>
<P>
The American Diversified litigation became one of the costliest proceedings 
among thrift failures as the federal government spent an estimated $15 million 
or more to gather the evidence and to pursue Sahni and Day. 
</P>
<P>
Sahni fought back with lawsuits of his own, charging regulators with having 
seized control of assets that were his, not the thrift's. The litigation 
quickly became a seemingly endless quagmire of charges and countercharges, and 
some lawyers questioned long ago whether the government could ever win more 
than it had spent on legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Sahni and Ferrante were two of four maverick Orange County bankers who vowed in 
early 1987 to fight thrift regulators over the takeovers of their institutions 
and over the allegations against them. They charged that they were being made 
scapegoats in the growing thrift fiasco and that they had done nothing wrong.

ORANGE INVESTOR PLEADS GUILTY TO INSIDER TRADING; 
</P>
<P>
SCANDAL: STEPHEN R. RASINSKI ADMITS THAT HE IMPROPERLY EARNED AT LEAST $115,000 
FROM INFORMATION IN ADVANCE COPIES OF BUSINESS WEEK. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange investor pleaded guilty Monday in U.S. District Court in New York to 
charges of insider trading, admitting that he used information culled from 
advance copies of Business Week magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen R. Rasinski, 35, was accused of having improperly earned at least 
$115,000 between September, 1986, and July, 1988, by buying stock in companies 
mentioned in the "Inside Wall Street" column before the magazine was available 
to the public. A mention in the column generally raised a company's stock 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Rasinski's guilty plea is the latest development in the growing insider-trading 
scandal involving Business Week. Thirteen individuals in several unrelated 
cases involving the magazine have been charged with criminal or civil 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Rasinski could not be reached for comment Monday. He faces a minimum sentence 
of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
In entering his plea Monday, Rasinski told the court that he had received the 
inside information from his stockbroker, John L. Petit of Newport Beach. Petit 
has admitted that he paid hundreds of dollars a week for the information, which 
Petit received from Shayne Walters, a former salesman for one of Business 
Week's printers, R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Both Petit and Walters have pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges in the 
case and face sentences of 10 years in prison and fines of up to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Alice Hill, who is heading the investigation, said the 
criminal inquiry is continuing. Petit is cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Rasinski was first named in the scandal last month when the Securities and 
Exchange Commission accused him of insider trading in a civil complaint filed 
in U.S. District Court in New York. The civil case is still pending; the SEC is 
seeking damages equal to three times Rasinski's profits. 
</P>
<P>
"We believed he willfully violated the securities law," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC has also named Pacific Palisades stockbroker Lawrence M. Small, a 
former broker with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., in connection with the 
Business Week case. The SEC alleges that Petit, also a former Smith Barney 
broker, paid Walters for advance copies of the magazines and that Petit then 
provided the information to Rasinski and Small, who in turn contributed to 
payments to Walters.

JOSEPH N. BELL: PARADISE IS PUT ON THE BACK BURNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I stopped by Dr. Bill Anderson's house in Laguna Beach the other day to talk to 
him about Saudi Arabia, from where he recently returned. We ended up by 
spending most of our time talking about his lifetime fantasy -- which he also 
lived out recently -- of returning to the American frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is a 46-year-old general practitioner who spent six years as the 
director of student health services at UC Irvine. He was also the doctor for 
Bill Mulligan's UCI basketball team, and Anderson and I spent a good many 
evenings over those six years sitting in the stands at the Bren Center 
second-guessing Mulligan's coaching decisions. One of the few pieces of good 
luck Anderson has enjoyed the past two years is being happily absent during 
UCI's 5-23 season. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson cut out of Orange County in 1988 to take his wife, Catherine, and two 
small children to Big Sur country, where he would go back to basics, live off 
the land and be a country doctor. We talked about this when we weren't talking 
basketball, and his eyes would light and his voice grow animated whenever he 
projected it. 
</P>
<P>
I had some misgivings, especially when he told me he would be moving his family 
into a converted barn, temporarily without electricity, at the end of a 3-mile 
torturous dirt road that hugged a cliff and turned into a quagmire when it 
rained. He made it sound like Valhalla. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it was something less than that -- how much less depends on whether you 
are talking to Bill or Catherine. Country doctoring turned out to be 
impractical as a livelihood, and the nearest place Bill could find work was 
Hollister, a two-hour drive away. Bill worked in the emergency room there -- 24 
hours on ("24 hours in hell" he called it) and 48 off. Catherine assured me 
that most of the crises at the old homestead took place when Bill was either at 
work or on his way. 
</P>
<P>
There was, for example, the matter of the Doberman. The Andersons' dog, Comet, 
took to hanging out with two Doberman pinchers at their nearest neighbor's, a 
mile away, because they offered a house with heat, food served indoors, and 
other amenities to which Comet had become accustomed in an earlier life. To woo 
Comet back to the family, the Andersons adopted a Doberman from the nearest dog 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter their livestock began to disappear, notably chickens and 
geese. The evidence was circumstantial until they caught the new Doberman with 
a dead goose just as Bill was leaving for work one morning. "Tie the goose 
around the dog's neck," he instructed his wife, "and that will cure him of this 
forever." Then he left. 
</P>
<P>
So Catherine tied up the Doberman and hung the dead goose around his neck. A 
few minutes later, having chewed through the rope, the Doberman bounced into 
the converted barn, dragging the bloody goose along. Twice, Catherine 
re-secured the Doberman, re-affixed the goose, and retreated to the house -- a 
little more hysterical each time. And twice the Doberman returned, his psyche 
apparently undamaged by the corpse around his neck. When Bill finally came 
home, his wife was waiting in the driveway with a badly shaken psyche of her 
own to take the Doberman back to the pound. 
</P>
<P>
There were dozens of stories like this. It took two months, for example, to get 
a generator working to supply the Anderson family electricity, and then it 
wouldn't store up power but had to be running whenever the lights were on. It 
shook so violently that the whole barn would quiver and pictures would dance on 
the walls. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid such distractions, Catherine would serve dinner at 3:30 during the 
winter so they wouldn't have to eat in pitch darkness. At Christmas, when 
Catherine's family came to visit, it rained for a week and her father sat up 
most of every night feeding paper and wood into the stove that provided the 
only heat, convinced they would all freeze if he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"People we invited up would look at me kind of strangely after they got here," 
Bill told me, apparently still puzzled over this. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was to live in the barn only until they were able to buy land and 
build their own house. But several factors weren't considered when the plan was 
made. Like a local requirement that every new house must be located on a tract 
of at least 40 acres of land. And a tough building code. And environmental 
restrictions that probably would have taken many months to work through. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the first year, it was clear that they wouldn't be able to build 
-- and that they had to locate somewhere closer to civilization. With maybe a 
grocery store and a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
So the Andersons bought a splendid, spacious home in Hollister -- and moved in 
two days before the earthquake that shook the Bay Area last year. Their house 
survived better than their psyches, so their stay in Hollister was probably 
foredoomed from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Two days after we moved," says Anderson, "we were without water and 
electricity again -- and that's when I started suspecting I was doing the wrong 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
When they decided last summer -- to the immense relief of Anderson's old 
patients -- to move back to Laguna, Bill got restless. That's where Saudi 
Arabia comes in. A doctor friend told him that the King Faisal Specialist 
Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh was looking for American doctors to fill 
in for a month for vacationing staff physicians, so Bill went. And his luck 
held. He's written a long piece about it which is full of thoughtful insights. 
</P>
<P>
He stressed two of these in particular that he feels have not been presented 
very clearly to the American people. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to assume," he told me, "that our intelligence has made clear to the 
people setting policy in this country the vast differences in culture and 
thinking between the Western and Arab countries. I don't think these 
differences are fully appreciated here. They need to be escalated to another 
plane where these factors are taken much more strongly into consideration. 
We're not going to get anywhere by trying to force them to play our rules by 
using Western logic." 
</P>
<P>
And, second, Anderson pointed out that we have very little comprehension of why 
some Arab nations have thrown in with us against their Arab brothers. "The 
overthrow of the royal family in Kuwait," he said, "is the first time that the 
proletariat has ever risen up successfully against a royal family in the Arab 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"That has a lot of royal families worried. They don't want to see that 
precedent set in Kuwait, and that's why they are supporting us. The first 
rumors we heard in Riyadh were that rank-and-file Kuwaitis were throwing in 
with Iraq because they wanted out from under the royal family. There's still a 
lot of that feeling around." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the people in Riyadh -- the capital of Saudi Arabia -- were 
"pretty well insulated from day-to-day news because this is a very closed and 
controlled society. People were nervous but not afraid. This is a society where 
everything stops five times a day for prayer. Everything. That's the extent of 
control." 
</P>
<P>
So Bill Anderson follows the news out of the Persian Gulf with a special 
fascination while he tries to reorder his life in Orange County. At the moment, 
that means re-establishing his private practice while he works two gigs at 
Emergicenter Family Care in Costa Mesa and Anaheim Memorial Urgent Care in 
Anaheim Hills. He also plans to catch some UCI basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he hasn't let go of his fantasy, just put it on the back burner. "I 
want to go back there someday, and I will," he says firmly. "We gained a lot 
from that experience. This country grew out of that kind of spirit. A lot of me 
is still there and always will be."

KEEPING FIT: A PORTABLE BREATH OF LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW TECHNOLOGY IN OXYGEN TANKS GIVES ADDED MOBILITY TO PEOPLE WITH BREATHING 
PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, Robert Beals of San Clemente realized that it was time to get 
serious about his health. Since then, he has quit smoking, developed a regular 
exercise habit and started using supplemental oxygen. "They gave me a choice," 
he says. "I could extend and improve the quality of my life, or I could just 
keep going the way I was. 
</P>
<P>
"So it really wasn't hard to choose." 
</P>
<P>
Beals, 74, has had lung problems since he was a child. "I had double pneumonia 
on two occasions, and I've been a little bit short of breath ever since," he 
says. From the time he was a teen-ager, he compounded the problem by smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Emphysema, a chronic lung disease most often brought on by smoking, began to 
slow him down about 10 years ago. He tired more easily, became short of breath 
more often. But he kept going, traveling frequently to the Far East on 
business. It was on one of those trips that he finally became so ill he needed 
oxygen on the flight home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd had a flu bug before I left, but on the trip it just kept getting worse. 
When I got back, I had lost a lot of weight and I had pneumonia. After that, my 
doctors suggested I go on oxygen full time," Beals says. 
</P>
<P>
Now Beals feels better than he has in years. 
</P>
<P>
Although he prefers not to schedule his workouts, he makes sure he gets in 
exercise sessions about three times a week. Some days, he walks along the shore 
near Dana Point Harbor. Other times, particularly when the air is smoggy, he 
moves indoors to walk at the Mission Viejo or Laguna Hills malls. Or he stays 
home and rides his exercise bike. 
</P>
<P>
And if he happens to be in Singapore or Thailand or Taiwan or any of the other 
places he visits frequently as a manufacturer's representative, he does his 
walking there, carrying a small portable oxygen tank in an over-the-shoulder 
carrying case. 
</P>
<P>
When Beals first began using oxygen, he wasn't quite so mobile. Although he 
soon felt well enough to exercise, he was encumbered by a tank so big and heavy 
he had to pull it along on a cart. It was a nuisance, especially for activities 
such as going to the beach -- the cart didn't move so well in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
And people stared. Beals says he still gets odd looks now and then from 
strangers who notice the nasal cannula that connects him to the portable tank, 
"But when that happens, I just smile, and they usually smile back." 
</P>
<P>
Although supplemental oxygen has proven its worth in numerous studies over the 
past decade or so, many of those who could benefit from it are reluctant to use 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Paul Selecky, a pulmonary specialist at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach and 
president of the American Lung Assn.'s Orange County chapter, understands those 
apprehensions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a visible change," he says. "People see them with the oxygen cannula in 
their nose, and suddenly their personal life has become public." 
</P>
<P>
Although going on oxygen may feel like taking a step down in terms of health, 
it's more likely to be a step up, Selecky says. "This has set many patients 
free, and allowed them to do things they wouldn't have been able to do before. 
They can travel, they can get involved in exercise programs. And new 
technologies have allowed this to be done more and more efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
Selecky recalls one patient, formerly an avid skier, whose illness kept him 
from hitting the slopes. "The combination of exertion and the higher altitude 
made it impossible for him. But with the use of a small oxygen tank he was able 
to carry in a little backpack, he started skiing again," Selecky says. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, oxygen tanks have become smaller and lighter, 
Selecky says. And with battery-powered electronic delivery devices that only 
release the gas when the user is inhaling, the supply also lasts longer. 
</P>

Beals uses a system called Vagabond, made by Anaheim-based XEBEK International. 
XEBEK President John Dooley says he got the idea to make smaller, lighter 
oxygen tanks several years ago when his 80-year-old mother-in-law began using 
oxygen because of heart and respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The cylinder she had to use was so big you'd need to be 6-foot-4 and weigh 220 
pounds to carry it. And she weighs about 85 pounds soaking wet. When I saw 
that, I said, 'Wait a minute -- there's got to be an easier way to do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
So using fiberglass composite materials that were originally developed for NASA 
rocket motor casings, XEBEK developed a smaller, lighter cylinder. "Our system 
weighs less than 5 pounds, and lasts an average of about 12 hours." 
</P>
<P>
XEBEK has also developed an even smaller system for children. 
</P>
<P>
Older patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) 
such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the ones most likely to need extra 
oxygen, Selecky says, although not all such patients do. The deciding factor is 
an analysis of arterial blood gases. If the level of oxygen is below a certain 
level, then the patient may need to be breathing in more oxygen than is 
available in the atmosphere, about 21%. 
</P>
<P>
Some patients may need oxygen full time, while others don't. "There are 
patients with significant lung disease or heart disease who may have adequate 
levels (of oxygen) at rest. But their lungs can't keep up when they get 
physically active. Similarly, there are patients whose oxygen only drops below 
that critical level during sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Other COPD patients may not need help except at higher altitudes, or in 
airplanes, where the pressurized air is roughly equivalent to that on an 
8,000-foot mountain peak. 
</P>
<P>
"Every airline has a different policy about oxygen," Selecky says. "Some don't 
provide it at all, and others will if you order it ahead of time. But they're 
not required to provide it." 
</P>
<P>
Beals, who spends a lot of time on airplanes, hasn't had trouble getting the 
airlines he deals with to provide oxygen. But he'd rather just take along his 
own tank. "They won't let me do that," he says. "I can take it in my checked 
baggage, but only if it's empty. So when I get there, I have to go to a 
hospital or someplace and get it filled." 
</P>
<P>
Oxygen isn't an explosive gas, but it does support combustion and should not be 
used around open flames. Still, airlines and some cruise ship lines are wary 
about letting their passengers bring it on board. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working with the airlines to get them to use our system," Dooley 
says. It's absolutely safe to use and transport. Obviously you don't want to be 
throwing it around like a basketball, but if somebody bumps it, there's no 
problem."

GETTING A HANDLE ON THE 'MESSIAH';

IT WAS A CHANCE TO SING OUT GLORIOUSLY WITH THE PACIFIC CHORALE -- IF YOU DARED

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Row U at Segerstrom Hall is not usually the place one sits if one wants to 
burst into song during a performance. True, on Sunday afternoon, the conductor, 
John Alexander, was facing us in the seats and not the orchestra -- looking 
straight at us and waving his arms -- but it's tough to beat down years of 
concert-going etiquette. Up would come a lusty fortissimo entrance and the 
little voice that lives in the part of the brain labeled "paralyzing 
embarrassment" would pipe up: 
</P>
<P>
"Hey . . . are you sure?" 
</P>
<P>
But this was the Pacific Chorale's "Sing-Along Messiah" at the Performing Arts 
Center and yes, Alexander was sure. As sure as you can be, anyway, when you're 
conducting nearly 1,000 people who may know the "Hallelujah Chorus" dead cold 
but whose eyes start to get a lot bigger on less familiar ground like "His Yoke 
Is Easy," when the pages start to turn black with notes. 
</P>
<P>
No one seemed to care, though. The stage was filled, comfortingly, with a 
Handel-sized Pacific Symphony and 11 soloists who would sing the airs and 
recitatives. The audience, augmented by the members of the Pacific Chorale who 
sat throughout the hall to help shore things up in the more breathtaking 
passages, would sing the 11 choruses. 
</P>
<P>
It was a chance to take on the greater part of a monumental piece of music, at 
which most in the audience may have taken only a cursory swipe in their school 
or church choirs. 
</P>
<P>
Your armor was your score. Almost 200 people who didn't bring their own 
thumb-worn copies paid $7 each for a squeaky-clean Schirmer edition at a booth 
outside the hall. One man who bought a score said he already had four copies at 
home and wanted "to add another one to the collection." Another man, caught 
short, said, "I'd better have one. I've got two in Boston, but I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
Still another man in a Santa Claus tie, initially enthusiastic about buying a 
score, apparently changed his mind after skimming it briefly. He handed it back 
with a sheepish laugh, saying, "I'll pass, I guess." Sure enough, when the 
singing started and those 16th-note runs got a little thick, it wasn't unlike 
that dream where you show up at work or school and suddenly realize you're 
naked. 
</P>
<P>
Age seemed to be no barrier to participation. Pam Crostic of Santa Ana and her 
6-year-old daughter, Katie, arrived with Susan McCloskey of Orange and her two 
granddaughters, 7-year-old April and 6-year-old Dana. "I love this," said 
Crostic, who said she had once sung in a church youth choir. "Now, I just sing 
in the shower, but it's nothing like having that big chorus surround you," she 
added. McCloskey said her sister refused to go so she took her granddaughters 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real privilege to do this," said Donna Whitmire of Santa Ana. Leslie 
Graham of Seal Beach, who came with Whitmire, is an amateur violinist who also 
likes "to sing. But I find it difficult. It's hard to follow all the different 
parts and not get lost." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, Alexander surveyed the audience/participants. He wanted to know where 
he stood before he plunged in. 
</P>
<P>
"Does everybody have a score?," he asked. Several hundred hands went up, 
clutching Schirmer scores, Watkins Shaw scores, chorus-only scores, scores that 
looked like they belonged in the Smithsonian. 
</P>
<P>
"How many of you read music?" Fewer hands. 
</P>
<P>
"How many have done the 'Hallelujah Chorus?' " A thick forest of hands. 
</P>
<P>
"How many know "Worthy Is the Lamb (the intricate and difficult finale of the 
piece)?" Hands dropped into laps. Groans escaped. Alexander grinned. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh," he said, "we're in trouble. We're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
He offered only one piece of advice: Try to stay on the right page. 
</P>
<P>
Most did. During the tenor recitative "Comfort Ye My People," the hall was 
filled with the sound of hundreds of people turning their pages at once. 
</P>
<P>
The first chorus section, "And the Glory of the Lord," was a revelation. It 
wasn't just sound, but a wash of sound, not focused but amorphous, coming from 
everywhere. The Pacific Chorale provided a kind of anchor for the sound, but 
the audience supplied the body, the sheer weight. It was what Victorian 
performances of the work must have sounded like when it was in vogue to mount 
the work with Ben-Hur-sized choruses and orchestras, cramming concert halls 
with hundreds of musicians and trying to blow the doors off the place. 
</P>
<P>
Not that all the singing was abandoned and lusty. A fleet -- and, to many, 
undoubtedly unfamiliar -- chorus like "And He Shall Purify" sent hundreds of 
eyes diving desperately from the conductor into the scores and set several 
heads to shaking in resignation or frustration. At such moments, being a 
Pacific Chorale singer meant that everyone suddenly knew who you were. 
</P>
<P>
For the chorale members, particularly the tenors, it also meant feeling as if 
you were working without a net. Singers have nightmares in which they launch 
into a loud, bravura series of rhythmic gymnastics and discover they are the 
only one singing. 
</P>
<P>
Obligingly, however, the audience would snatch up the line when the longer 
notes eventually appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the singers in the audience seemed to be women, although most were with 
husbands or boyfriends. Many men who weren't singing lent support to the women, 
reading the score over their shoulders, but some simply followed the concert in 
the program handout. At least one man on the orchestra level busied himself 
with a magazine, and after the concert a few newspapers were found left behind. 
</P>
<P>
The "Hallelujah Chorus" changed all that. This was the one that the old high 
school choristers, the church choir aficionados, the shower singers and the 
people who sing old Beach Boys tunes in the car were waiting for. And the 
volume and accuracy increased proportionally, partially because everyone stood. 
</P>
<P>
(The most often-quoted story about the tradition of standing for this chorus 
holds that King George I of England was so moved by the music that he stood in 
reverence and the audience, observing royal protocol, stood as well. Another 
version asserts that the king arrived at the performance late, during the 
"Hallelujah Chorus," and, again, the audience stood. It is probably more likely 
that the king was simply tired by that late point in the concert -- the chorus 
marks the end of Part II -- and decided to stretch his legs.) 
</P>
<P>
It was a splendid, huge sound, and the final cutoff prompted a burst of 
applause, congratulations among audience members, and general amiable chatting. 
Alexander let it go on for a while before he said with mock reproach, "Choirs 
aren't supposed to talk between Parts II and III." 
</P>
<P>
The finale, "Worthy Is the Lamb That Was Slain," used up most of the oxygen in 
the hall and most of what was left of everyone's capacity for following a score 
and singing at the same time. It is a wickedly difficult chorus, even for the 
experienced singer, and there were more than a few sight readers in the room. 
The secret to survival was to put the going-to-school-naked nightmare on hold 
and press on. 
</P>
<P>
The reward at the end was an encore of the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- "one final 
bang" Alexander called it. And it was. 
</P>
<P>
The talk outside afterward sounded a lot like the Anaheim Stadium parking lot 
in early October: "Wait till next year!" Crostic, however, was still smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls all sang," she said, and the girls nodded. "They know it all by 
heart now, right?" They nodded again. Before she and McCloskey shepherded them 
off, she took a deep breath and fixed a look on her face that was as close to 
resolute as one can get after spending a couple of hours doing battle with 
Handel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to go home," she said, "and practice."

<P>
To anyone who has seen and heard Zdenek Macal conduct, his speech cannot come 
as much of a surprise. At 54, the man is absolutely bursting with energy. He 
speaks quickly, backtracks, qualifies and generally exhibits a mind that seems 
to work faster than he can form the words in his Czech-accented, ungrammatical 
but highly expressive English. 
</P>
<P>
His enthusiasm is the kind that catches, and he speaks with pride of a recent 
appearance with the New York Philharmonic. "The players told me that they are 
known as killers of conductors, and I said I don't care. I don't remember that 
I had any problems. Mostly I get almost every orchestra on my side in some way. 
</P>
<P>
"I simply try to do the best possible concert, not only because it is my job 
but because it's a great thing, it is a great privilege to conduct any music. I 
feel blessed to do Brahms or Beethoven or Barber or whatever I do." 
</P>
<P>
He says that after the concert, "they put in the newspapers in New York that 
the 'orchestra obviously likes him, they play for him, audiences go wild.' I 
had almost every night one standing ovation at intermission, then after the 
concert a second one. In New York! What more could you want?" 
</P>
<P>
The music director of the Milwaukee Symphony, Macal -- who has a home here in 
Laguna Niguel -- will guest-conduct the Pacific Symphony in Costa Mesa 
Wednesday and Thursday nights. The main function of a conductor, Macal feels, 
is to stir up an orchestra and, through it, the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is something which is very emotional; it's not mechanical, you can't 
prepare it. Yesterday I conducted this part of the Dvorak this way, and 
tomorrow probably at the same place I will do it a different way. Why? Because 
it's a different day, or because it's not afternoon, it's evening. You must act 
very sensitively to the moment. We shouldn't be in a corset. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's the fascination! I did Beethoven's Seventh 70 or 80 times and 
Strauss' 'Zarathustra' 50 times but it's always exciting for me. Even if I do 
the same piece three or four times in a row, I always try to do some rubato 
which I didn't rehearse, just to keep the orchestra on the alert. Because 
otherwise they play mechanically, and that's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Business is half of our life, he says. "The other part is inside, what kind of 
people we are. That's why the music and the arts are here, to simply remind the 
people to live the emotional life, because for most people the inside is 
sleeping, really sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
Macal, who has performed with more than 150 orchestras around the world, holds 
positions with the San Antonio Symphony and for the Grant Park concerts in 
Chicago in addition to the directorship in Milwaukee. After this year, though, 
he will drop the first two jobs. "I cannot do three orchestras," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But his guest-conducting schedule remains full. It includes recent appearances 
with major orchestras in Houston, Boston, Detroit and Washington, as well as in 
New York. During this interview at his hilltop home in Laguna Niguel, he was 
interrupted by a phone call from the Philadelphia Orchestra, which wants him 
for two programs next summer. 
</P>
<P>
He has made several recordings with the Milwaukee Symphony and plans to 
continue with Berlioz's "Lelio" with Werner Klemperer as narrator, the two 
Chopin concertos with Shura Cherkassky as soloist, and the rest of a full cycle 
of the nine Dvorak symphonies, of which five already are completed. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra has had its share of financial troubles, but Macal is pleased 
with its musical progress. "Oh, it was a provincial orchestra," he recalls. 
"But in four years we have moved, and we are visible on the map." 
</P>
<P>
His speech becomes somewhat more guarded when talk turns to the Sydney 
Symphony, which he fled well before his contract expired, complaining of 
difficult working conditions and the Australian tax rate. But he says all the 
unpleasantness is behind him. "Just last week," he says, beaming, "they 
contacted my manager here and asked if I would like to go back. They talk very 
positively about me, and they said the orchestra had its best performances in 
the time that I was there." 
</P>
<P>
His program of Czech music with the Pacific Symphony this week includes 
Smetana's Overture to "The Bartered Bride," Dvorak's Eighth Symphony and 
Janacek's Sinfonietta. But he downplays the idea that he's any better than 
anyone else at conducting music from his native land. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, I am close to the Slavonic music, I am close to the Russian music, 
that is my background. Maybe if I just say it is easier for me to interpret it 
than some other kinds of music. I must work harder on some other things. Let's 
put it this way: Maybe some German conductor has to work harder on Slavonic 
music because his German spirit is maybe too heavy and hasn't enough color for 
this Slavonic music." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he's wary of returning to Czechoslovakia -- which he left during the 
Russian invasion of 1968, with just two bags and his family -- despite recent 
changes there. "I don't think that the Communists can change overnight by only 
giving up their membership in the party. I'm still surprised that in the 
election Havel got 37% and the Communists 17%. It's still a high number for me, 
17%. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, my home is here." He will become a U.S. citizen in two years. "The 
most important thing is that I feel I have a home. Because for almost 20 years 
I had none. Living in Europe after 1968, I was not Swiss, not French, not 
Czech, not Austrian. So please don't ask me to go through the whole process 
again, that I must lose my feeling for my home."

BANK MADE PUSH INTO A FIELD NOW JUDGED TOO RISKY; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCING: IT HOPED TO REAP LARGE FEES FROM THE TYPE OF MERCHANT BANKING 
ACTIVITIES THAT BROKERAGES CARRY OUT. BUT THERE WERE TOO MANY PLAYERS.

<P>
Security Pacific's move to disband its merchant banking division threatens to 
further remove grease from the wheels of corporate finance in California -- the 
network of lenders that provides capital and financial advice to companies. 
</P>
<P>
But if Security indeed exits completely from such fields as merger advisement 
and leveraged-buyout lending, it won't leave much of a vacuum in the short run, 
the bank's competitors say. 
</P>
<P>
Most investment bankers admit that there are far too many deal makers vying for 
a shrinking pie; in any case, they say, Security's corporate finance strategy 
didn't seem well-focused. 
</P>
<P>
Of greater concern to competitors and to corporate clients is whether 
Security's troubles in merchant banking foretell greater financial problems for 
the bank in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Security's announcement Monday that it will refocus on its traditional lending 
businesses did not specify all of the merchant-banking businesses it will 
depart. But it will shrink or shut down completely its corporate lending 
activities in Europe and Australia, and overall about 4,000 jobs worldwide 
could be cut as the bank exits other facets of merchant banking. 
</P>
<P>
The broad umbrella of "merchant banking" encompasses a multitude of businesses 
at Security, as at most of California's large commercial banks. Generally, 
merchant banking involves those corporate finance activities beyond the scope 
of straightforward lending to businesses: merger-deal financing, leveraged 
buyout lending, underwriting of corporate bonds and, perhaps most important, 
international lending. 
</P>
<P>
What most merchant-banking businesses have in common is that they typically are 
riskier than traditional banking. 
</P>
<P>
Security's lunge into merchant banking in the 1980s was part of a dramatic 
expansion by major American commercial banks into new fields. The wave was 
partly designed to combat Wall Street brokerages' increasing pilferage of 
banks' traditional corporate customers. Banks felt that they needed to offer 
their business customers new financing options to keep up with brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
Also, as takeover mania soared worldwide, banks saw merger-advisory and 
financing as a great way to snare new fee income. 
</P>
<P>
Security jumped into international merchant-banking in a big way in 1982, when 
it bought 30% of London-based brokerage Hoare Govett. In 1987, Security took 
over Hoare Govett completely and also bought 30% of Burns Fry Ltd., one of 
Canada's major brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the bank expanded its merger-advisory business in the United States 
throughout the 1980s, often hiring star investment bankers away from Wall 
Street brokerages at big salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"The commercial banks in general came after Wall Street and busted the salary 
scale," said one Los Angeles investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
Security's aggressiveness also extended to the pricing of services, competitors 
say. "They were willing to work on the cheap," one Los Angeles competitor said. 
If a company wanted an estimate of what a division might fetch if sold, 
Security might charge $50,000 for what a Wall Street brokerage would charge 
$100,000, competitors say. 
</P>
<P>
The goal, of course, was to build market share. Security also was able to use 
its leverage with existing corporate customers to sell new corporate-finance 
services, competitors say. 
</P>
<P>
But many executives in the Los Angeles offices of Wall Street brokerages 
maintain that Security tried to do too much under merchant-banking chief David 
R. Lovejoy, and that its strategy wasn't clear. "They just never pulled it 
off," said one executive at a regional brokerage. Lovejoy did not take phone 
calls Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Even in 1989, while the takeover business still flourished, profit at 
Security's merchant-banking arm was disappointing. Its return on average 
assets, a measure of earning power, was just 0.61% last year. In contrast, the 
bank's retail-banking division earned 2.27% on assets. 
</P>
<P>
Security's merchant-banking division has had some major successes, including a 
money-management unit that invests $25 billion for clients, and the Sequor 
Group, which handles clearing and settlement of securities. Competitors believe 
that Security will keep both of those operations, melding them into other parts 
of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
But Security's investment in Hoare Govett soured as trading and financing in 
Europe dried up after the 1987 stock market crash. "It became a sinkhole for 
them," said one Los Angeles money-management professional. Also, Security now 
is suffering major loan problems in Britain and Australia. In September, the 
bank opted to get rid of 51% of its Hoare stake by selling it to the 
brokerage's managers. 
</P>
<P>
The final blow to Security, as to many other banks and brokerages in merchant 
banking, was the plunge in merger and takeover activity worldwide this year. 
Caught with a staff full of investment bankers and other professionals, 
Security now is merely following the lead of its competitors, slashing payroll 
and entire divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Now, beyond the piecemeal decisions about what to keep and what to jettison 
from merchant banking, Security also must show that the international loan 
portfolio its investment bankers built up in the 1980s isn't full of more 
disasters waiting to happen, competitors say.

TRUMP DIVORCE FINAL; MONEY MATTERS REMAIN

<P>
A tearful Ivana Trump was divorced today from her millionaire husband, Donald, 
whose "cruel and inhuman treatment" of his ex-wife was cited for the end of 
their 13-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
But the dissolution of the marriage left unresolved exactly who will get what 
from the troubled Trump empire and whether the couple's marital agreement 
giving "the Donald" the lion's share will hold. 
</P>
<P>
Ivana Trump, assisted by attorney Michael Kennedy, left the courthouse in tears 
after the divorce was approved by Manhattan Divorce Court Judge Phyllis 
Gangel-Jacob. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad day for everyone, particularly our children and families," Ivana 
Trump said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Trump, meanwhile, issued a statement of goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish Ivana the best. I have no doubt that she will do very well in the years 
to come," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But whether Ivana Trump will do it with a reported $25-million prenuptial 
agreement or with much more remains to be seen. The judge said all other money 
matters, such as child support, equitable distribution of property and the 
validity of any pre- and post-marital agreement, will be decided at trial, 
unless they are otherwise resolved. 
</P>
<P>
No trial date was set. Ivana Trump, in court papers filed earlier this year, 
was seeking $2.5 billion of her ex-husband's estimated $5-billion fortune -- a 
figure financial analysts say has dwindled in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
In granting the divorce, Gangel-Jacob cited "Mr. Trump's cruel and inhuman 
treatment such as made it unfaith or improper to continue to be married." The 
judge did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Trump has been romantically linked with aspiring actress and model Marla 
Maples, 26. 
</P>
<P>
"Marla is out of town on business. She won't be having any comment," said her 
spokesman, Chuck Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Ivana Trump argued in court papers that the couple's updated marital agreement, 
signed in December, 1987, was drawn up while her husband was already committing 
adultery with Maples and intended to leave her.

Investigators removed a body from a pauper's cemetery in the suburb of Willow 
Springs today and plan to examine it to determine if it is that of candy 
heiress Helen Brach, who disappeared 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators want to run genetic tests on the body of a woman found dead 
in the woods near suburban Calumet City in 1978, according to reports in the 
Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cook County Medical Examiner Robert J. Stein concluded in 1978 that 
the body was not Brach's, "We developed additional information, which we felt 
significant enough to warrant a re-examination of the body," Jerry Singer, a 
spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Brach, heiress to the Brach Candy Co. fortune, disappeared when she was 65 in 
1977 in Rochester, Minn. Her net worth then was estimated at $17 million. Her 
estate is now valued at more than $50 million. After she was declared dead in 
1984, most of her money went to the Helen Brach Foundation.

The 130-year-old, all-male Olympic Club today tentatively settled a 1987 
discrimination suit with the city by agreeing to admit women and adopting a 
policy of non-discrimination against minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the city agreed to drop its lawsuit against the club and give it 
an option to buy 17 acres of city land, part of which contains three holes of 
the club's championship golf course. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Club, with 6,000 members, agreed to admit women within 60 days, 
adopt the non-discrimination policy and keep in place an existing court 
injunction against discrimination.

Police are trying to determine whether LSD or another drug was put in the 
coffee of a high school English teacher who has long been the target of student 
pranks. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Heffernan began convulsing and hallucinating after drinking from a coffee 
mug on his desk during a class at Troy Athens High School in suburban Detroit 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old teacher, who said he never has taken drugs, thought he was 
having a heart attack. Another teacher helped Heffernan to a hospital where he 
was treated and released that evening. 
</P>
<P>
Heffernan, who has taught English for 20 years, was described by colleagues as 
a sensitive, soft-spoken man often taunted by students. "He is literally a 
persecuted man," said one teacher, who said students regularly steal tests and 
graded homework from Heffernan's desk and that several students ambushed him in 
1976 and cut off one side of the handlebar mustache he had grown for the 
nation's bicentennial.

SHAMIR SAYS STRAINS IN U.S.-ISRAEL TIES EASED

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today that he and President Bush 
have smoothed relations between their two countries, strained by the U.S. 
partnership with Arab leaders against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Bush issued a "warm welcome" to Shamir at the outset of their Oval Office talks 
this morning but he rebuffed questions from reporters about the Middle East 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been delighted to express our full support for the leadership of the 
President, for the policy of the United States in this recent crisis of the 
gulf," Shamir told reporters after spending nearly two hours with Bush at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
"And the President also expresses his support for our behavior, for our policy" 
in the crisis, Shamir added. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said before the meeting that Shamir would tell Bush that 
Israel did not intend to launch any preemptive strikes against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly said that Shamir didn't talk about 
"potential Israeli actions" but that Bush thanked him for keeping a low profile 
in the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a strong expression of identity of views on seeing Iraqi aggression 
rebuffed," Kelly told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But he also said "there was no attempt to duck the tough issues" of Jewish 
settlements in the occupied territories and Israel's use of force against 
Palestinian protests in those areas. Kelly did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has been concerned in recent days by suggestions from senior 
Israeli officials that if the United States doesn't dismantle Iraq's military 
machine, Israel might. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reached general understanding, more or less, on all the moves in the 
gulf and on Israel's position," Shamir told reporters.

SCHOLAR WOULD SEEK TOMB OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT UNDER MOSQUE

The 139th attempt to find Alexander the Great has gotten off to a shaky start, 
and many fear it will end like the previous 138 attempts -- in futility. 
</P>
<P>
An Islamic history professor is convinced that the great Macedonian king, who 
conquered much of the known world before the age of 30 in the 4th Century BC, 
is buried in a vault beneath an Alexandria mosque, and he has asked the 
Department of Antiquities for permission to search for the tomb. 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian professor, Mohammed Abdulaziz, says he has two witnesses who have 
seen Alexander's burial place in a cavern deep under the Prophet Daniel Mosque 
in the historic Mediterranean city founded by the Macedonian king. 
</P>
<P>
However a professor of Greek history has dismissed the claim, saying he 
personally has explored under the mosque and found nothing more enticing than 
some water tanks dating from the 5th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has caused something of a flap among Alexandria residents and the 
international archeological community. But it is only the latest controversy in 
an escalating campaign to find the final resting place of Alexander, which is 
in turn part of a larger campaign to restore Alexandria to its former glory and 
increase its tourism potential. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Department of Antiquities must decide whether to grant Abdulaziz's 
request to probe under the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian king, whose empire stretched from Greece to modern-day India and 
Egypt, died in 323 BC at the age of 33 in Babylon and was, by historic 
accounts, buried in a royal cemetery in Alexandria, the city he had founded a 
decade earlier. 
</P>
<P>
But archeologists say that over the centuries of invasions, fires and 
reconstruction the exact location of Alexander's tomb became lost to history.

<P>
At least 37 people were killed today as rival black factions battled with guns, 
knives and axes, setting fire to shacks and chasing terrified people through 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of homes were burned and hundreds of residents fled as rival groups 
battled for several hours during the morning in Tokoza, a black township, and 
in a surrounding industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
Hacked and mutilated bodies lay outside houses that had been burned and 
pillaged. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting pitted mostly Xhosas loyal to the African National Congress 
against Zulus of the Inkatha Freedom Party in what increasingly appeared to be 
a tribal confrontation. The Xhosas live in a squatter camp, while the Zulus 
live in adjoining hostels. 
</P>
<P>
At least 53 people have died in factional fighting in Tokoza since the latest 
fighting began on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Xhosa squatters armed with clubs, spears and knives gathered for safety at one 
end of the township, while hundreds of armed Zulus in white headbands were 
waiting in a migrant workers' hostel at the other end of Tokoza. 
</P>
<P>
"We want revenge! . . . We want to fight!" some Zulus chanted.

The Parliament of the Soviet republic of Georgia today declared a state of 
emergency in a region that was making separatist moves, and the Soviet 
republic's government reasserted its control over the rebellious area, a report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble occurred in the South Ossetian Autonomous Region, one of three 
major subdivisions of the republic of Georgia in the Transcaucasian part of the 
western Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, the Parliament of the Russian Federation and the president of the 
republic of Kazakh rejected Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal to 
retain central control over the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgian legislature took its emergency steps two days after the South 
Ossetian region held illegal elections to form its own parliament, the 
independent Interfax news service said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has proposed a new union treaty to keep the 15 republics together and 
to maintain central government control over natural resources and major 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
But the Russian republic's Congress of People's Deputies and Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, the third-largest Soviet republic, each 
said they would sign the proposed treaty only if it gives them control over 
their own economies. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation has taken the same stand.

SHUTTLE'S MISSION CALLED A SUCCESS DESPITE PROBLEMS 
</P>

<P>
The space shuttle Columbia was expected back on Earth late Monday night, 
carrying a crew that overcame telescope-pointing problems and a threatening 
backup of waste water to squeeze a surprising amount of science from a mission 
that at times seemed jinxed. 
</P>
<P>
An approaching cold front bringing threatening weather forced NASA officials to 
cut the mission short by one day. The night landing, which ends the 38th 
shuttle mission and the 10th flight for Columbia, was to be the fourth in 
shuttle history. 
</P>
<P>
The launch of the shuttle was plagued by delays and the mission hampered by 
technical problems but nevertheless yielded significant astronomical data. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the launch, both computers that were to point the four telescopes 
that study ultraviolet light and X-rays and lock them on their targets failed 
to work. The crew later found that lint clogging the air vents caused both 
computers to overheat. 
</P>
<P>
The astronauts overcame the potentially mission-threatening glitch by working 
with technicians at Mission Control at the Marshall Space Flight Center in 
Huntsville, Ala., who radioed commands to point the telescopes in the general 
direction of their targets. Then the astronomers, working with a joystick 
similar to those used on video games, aimed the telescopes and locked them on 
target. 
</P>
<P>
Later, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials thought they 
would have to cut the flight short by one day because the drain tube for the 
waste disposal system jammed. The crew had to pump the waste water into plastic 
bags, restoring the system to working capacity. 
</P>
<P>
NASA spokesman Don Haley acknowledged that "as far as problems that were 
visible," this mission was probably the most trouble-plagued flight other than 
the Challenger explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties, NASA officials are elated at the volume of data the 
telescopes have yielded. "They collected more science than scientists and 
astronomers can assimilate," Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Astro Observatory aboard the Columbia contains four telescopes that can 
detect X-rays and ultraviolet light that are obscured by the Earth's 
atmosphere. They provided scientists with valuable data on various planets, 
stars and galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the telescopes also provided unprecedented evidence that indicates the 
existence of black holes. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, scientists reflected on their roller-coaster nine days at 
Marshall Space Flight Center. "For the scientists, we're just beginning" to 
study all the exciting data collected, said mission scientist Theodore Gull, 
who said he "broke down" after the emotional conclusion of science activity. 
"We know we are going to help rewrite the textbooks." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the telescope-pointing problems, which meant only 135 of 250 planned 
observations were made, the science part of the mission ended on the upswing, 
with the astronauts targeting a fast-moving comet just minutes before the three 
ultraviolet instruments were shut down. 
</P>
<P>
The workhorse Broad Band X-ray Telescope -- built at Goddard Space Flight 
Center and pointed independent of the Astro crew from a control room at the 
Greenbelt, Md., center -- operated for several more hours, taking a final look 
at a distant galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
"We went out with a bang," said Arthur Davidsen, who heads the team that built 
the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope at Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
The skipper of the Columbia is Vance D. Brand, 58, who is completing his fourth 
shuttle mission. Other crew members are pilot Guy S. Gardner, mission 
specialists Jeffrey A. Hoffman, John M. Lounge, Robert A. R. Parker, and 
payload specialists and civilian astronomers Samuel T. Durrance and Ronald A. 
Parise.

The colony's proposed new airport will cost $10.2 billion (HK$79 billion) at 
1990 prices, excluding a planned new port, the government said today as it 
released detailed estimates of the project's costs for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The airport, the most ambitious civil engineering project ever undertaken by 
Hong Kong, will be built on reclaimed land off northern Lantau Island and will 
be linked by road and rail to other parts of Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary to the Treasury Hamish MacLeod said the actual airport at Chek Lap 
Kok would cost $4.9 billion, with the new complex's road and transport 
infrastructure costing another $5.3 billion. When the plan was first announced 
in October last year, the government estimated the whole project, including new 
port facilities, at $16.4 billion at 1988 prices.

President Corazon Aquino today signed a service contract with Royal Dutch Shell 
and Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. for the exploration and 
development of potentially rich natural gas deposits in the Camago area off 
northern Palawan Island. 
</P>
<P>
National Power Corp. Chairman Ernesto Aboitiz said test wells in the region 
indicate an initial yield from the field equivalent to 160,000 barrels of oil a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
On the Manila Stock Exchange, stocks posted gains for the second straight day, 
buoyed by news that tests over the weekend conducted by Houston-based Alcorn 
Petroleum Inc. yielded up to 6,116 barrels of oil. 
</P>
<P>
The Philippines imports 95% of its oil needs and, despite exploration, has yet 
to strike a major oil or natural gas field.

Two nuclear power plant operators may not have been asleep, but they were 
working with their heads back and eyes closed during a surprise inspection, a 
federal agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Monday that it is proposing a $50,000 
fine against the New York Power Authority, the plant's owner. 
</P>
<P>
The Power Authority said it will contest the fine. It maintains that the two 
operators were attentive during an inspection on Sept. 14 at the Indian Point 3 
power plant in Buchanan, 35 miles north of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
But the regulatory commission said an inspector who visited the plant in 
September found the two operators sitting with heads tilted back and eyes 
closed, one with his feet on a desk. 
</P>
<P>
Both operators denied they were inattentive, and the Power Authority's 
executive vice president of nuclear generation, John C. Brons, said that 
control room records showed that the two had performed documented activities 
within a few minutes of the time the alleged inattention occurred.

GM PLANS TO ADD MINORITY DEALERSHIPS

<P>
General Motors Corp. plans a 40% boost in the number of minority-owned 
dealerships over the next three years, the auto maker announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans an additional 76 minority-owned dealerships by December, 
1993, said GM President Lloyd Reuss and Tony March, chairman of the 11-member 
GM Minority Dealer Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
GM has 192 black, Hispanic and Asian dealers, making up 2% of its about 9,600 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"Increased minority participation in our dealerships is vital to achieving GM's 
prime objective of the 1990s -- satisfying car and truck owners better than any 
other manufacturer," Reuss said. 
</P>
<P>
GM has conducted a minority dealer-training program since 1972. But March, one 
of GM's leading black dealers, said the new agreement went an important step 
further. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind about the commitment of Lloyd Reuss and (GM 
Chairman) Bob Stempel," said March, a Buick dealer from Hartford, Conn. "We are 
talking about a commitment from the largest corporation in the world." 
</P>
<P>
GM intends to increase the number of minority dealers in cities with relatively 
large minority populations, according to a GM statement. Those cities include 
Detroit, where four black-owned GM dealerships folded this year, leaving no 
black-owned GM franchises in the metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
At Ford and Chrysler, minorities make up 5.7% and 2.5%, respectively, of dealer 
ranks.

The golf pro resigned from the 94-year-old private club Nov. 28 when he learned 
the club's membership committee rejected an application by Bloch, who is

The pub where Rob Moroso drank beer before his fatal accident Sept. 30 is not 
to blame for the wreck that killed the rookie NASCAR driver and another person, 
the state Alcohol Law Enforcement division said today. 
</P>
<P>
The department said in a written statement that it found no evidence of 
irresponsible service by any establishment visited by the 22-year-old Moroso 
the night of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Woody's, a restaurant and bar near Cornelius, was the last place Moroso was 
seen after the NASCAR Winston Cup Holly Farms 400 race in North Wilkesboro, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the North Carolina Highway Patrol, Moroso was driving in excess of 
75 m.p.h. down a state highway near Mooresville when he lost control of the car 
on a curve and slid into the path of an oncoming car. Tammy Williams, 27, was 
killed when her car was struck by Moroso's.

Pete Sampras and Goran Ivanisevic scored opening-round victories today in the 
$6-million Grand Slam Cup, the richest tournament in tennis history. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, the U.S. Open champion from Rancho Palos Verdes who is seeded fourth 
in the tournament, overcame a sloppy start to beat Andrei Cherkasov of the 
Soviet Union, 5-7, 6-2, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, the fifth seed from Yugoslavia, beat Kevin Curren of the United 
States, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (9-7). 
</P>
<P>
The 16-man field was determined on the basis of results in this year's four 
Grand Slam tournaments -- the Australian, French and U.S. Opens and Wimbledon. 
The winner will get $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras lost the first set when he committed two double-faults. On the first, 
he fell behind 15-40. The 19-year-old American then served an ace but followed 
with another double-fault to give Cherkasov the set. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras quickly took control in the second set, breaking Cherkasov in the third 
game when the Soviet double-faulted. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras struggled to hold serve in the next game, going to eight deuces before 
winning the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't hitting my ground strokes very well," Sampras said. He said shin 
splints that he suffered in November were still bothering him occasionally and 
that he used ice packs during the match. 
</P>
<P>
An overhead smash gave Sampras another break in the next game and a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Serving for the set, Sampras fell behind 15-40 when he hit the net with a 
forehand. But he served three aces in the next four points to win the set. 
</P>
<P>
A string of errors by Cherkasov allowed Sampras to gain a break and take a 5-4 
lead in the decisive set. 
</P>
<P>
The American failed to put the match away in the next game. Facing three break 
points, he saved one with an ace and another with a service winner, but then 
sent a forehand long to allow Cherkasov to stay in the match. 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviet was unable to take advantage. A spectacular passing shot down 
the line gave Sampras two break points and when Cherkasov netted a backhand, 
the American regained the lead. 
</P>
<P>
He served out the match without problems, winning in two hours, 19 minutes and 
evened his career record against Cherkasov at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, who complained about several line calls, dropped his serve in the 
third game of the second set, beaten by a passing shot from Curren. He then 
smashed the ball into the stands and received a warning. 
</P>
<P>
"I deserved the warning but it was good for me because it calmed me down and I 
played better tennis after that," Ivanisevic said. 
</P>
<P>
He evened the score by breaking Curren in the eighth game and the American 
saved three match points to send the decisive set into a tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
Curren saved two more match points before surrendering to the Yugoslav's 
powerful serve.

Big East schools with Division I football programs will invite West Virginia, 
Temple, Rutgers, and Virginia Tech into a Big East football league, the 
Philadelphia Daily News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said athletic directors from Syracuse, Pitt, Boston College and 
Miami will meet Wednesday in Washington, D.C., to vote in the new members. 
</P>
<P>
Temple, Rutgers and West Virginia -- currently independents in football -- 
would remain in the Atlantic 10 for other sports, the newspaper said. Virginia 
Tech is in the Metro Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't react to (the News report) because I think someone's got a hunch, but 
it's not a fact yet," West Virginia Athletic Director Ed Pastilong said today. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope before the week's out we are presented a proposal as such. . . . They 
are meeting Wednesday and Thursday, I do know that, and they are meeting to 
discuss expansion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A conference like this should give our program more clout," Temple Athletic 
Director Charles Theokas told the Daily News. "And it should do wonders for the 
rest of Eastern football." 
</P>
<P>
Temple's football team finished 7-4 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"If something like this should work, right now, as we're speaking, we would 
have been boarding planes to a bowl game because we would have been second or 
third in Big East football rather than the second- or third-best independent in 
the East," Theokas said. 
</P>
<P>
Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese said he was drawing up papers to force the 
eight schools to make a 10-year commitment and prohibit them from forming an 
all-sports conference.

The "Bomba" is back. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to his spectacular form, Italy's Alberto Tomba turned in a dynamic 
second run today to win the first European slalom of the men's World Cup 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Tomba, in winning his 14th World Cup slalom, trailed Ole Christian Furuseth by 
one second after the first heat before beating the Norwegian with the same 
aggressive and powerful style which earned him the nickname "The Bomb" during 
his heyday in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently unaffected by falling snow -- somewhat unusual after two almost 
snowless winters -- Tomba completed the race in the winning time of 2 minutes, 
7.41 seconds. Nobody matched Tomba's 1:02.56 in the second heat. 
</P>
<P>
Furuseth finished 0.55 seconds behind the Italian in the aggregate time and 
said, "Tomba was super today. 
</P>
<P>
"I was cautious in the second heat. I had to take risks to beat Alberto. 
However, I am not displeased with a second place," Furuseth said. 
</P>
<P>
Tomba said he was overjoyed at winning in front of the home fans. 
</P>
<P>
He was given noisy, soccer-style support with horns and trumpets as he skied to 
victory down the Kandahar course, and was mobbed by fans when he approached the 
podium for the awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Tomba explained that his first-heat gap behind Furuseth resulted from wrong 
skis and two mistakes at the top of the course. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second run I used the right skis, the new ones, and at last I skied the 
way I wanted -- that's almost perfectly," Tomba said. 
</P>
<P>
The victory put Tomba atop the overall World Cup standings with 47 points out 
of five races. France's Franck Piccard, a specialist in fast disciplines of 
downhill and supergiant slalom who had led the standings, dropped to second 
with 42 points. Furuseth moved into fourth place with 38 points. 
</P>
<P>
Franz Heinzer of Switzerland, a downhiller, was third with 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not thinking of the overall title right now," said Tomba. "I could be a 
one-day leader as downhill specialists will pocket points in the next few 
races. I will have clearer ideas about my World Cup chances in January." 
</P>
<P>
He will next compete in a giant slalom Sunday in Val Badia, in northern Italy. 
That race will follow two consecutive downhills in nearby Val Gardena Friday 
and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Austrian and German slalom aces were the big losers in today's race. 
</P>
<P>
World slalom champion Rudolf Nierlich finished third, 1.77 seconds behind 
Tomba, while Armin Bittner lagged fifth, with a gap of 2.37 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Canadian skiers did poorly. Americans Felix McGrath, Tiger Shaw and 
Bob Ormsby did not qualify for the second heat while Canadian Alain Villiard 
fell in the final run.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ONLY ONE DRUG -- SO FAR -- WILL SPEED YOUR RECOVERY FROM FLU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON and TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I've been seeing television ads for new over-the-counter flu 
remedies. I remember your writing in past years about a drug for the flu, but I 
thought it was prescription only. Have they changed it to non-prescription this 
year? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: No. The ads you've seen are for old cold remedies that have been souped 
up and given a new marketing spin. These products may offer temporary symptom 
relief but they can't help you get over the flu faster. 
</P>
<P>
Only amantadine can do that, so far, and it is available only by prescription. 
If you take it within the first two days of coming down with Type A influenza, 
it can cut your convalescence time. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are there any medicines to eliminate dark coarse facial hair? I have to 
shave it off, but it is really embarrassing. Even foundation and powder don't 
cover it perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
When I asked my family doctor about it, he said that if my periods are regular 
there's probably nothing medically wrong. He thinks that I should learn to 
accept my appearance and not be self-conscious. I honestly don't find that 
advice very helpful and I hope you can tell me where to turn. 
</P>
<P>
A: Check with a dermatologist or endocrinologist. They have more experience in 
treating hirsutism. 
</P>
<P>
Facial hair growth is usually associated with an excess of male hormones, or 
androgens. (That's why men grow beards.) 
</P>
<P>
It is usually treated with a medicine that counteracts these hormones. One that 
has been used is spironolactone, a drug commonly used to treat high blood 
pressure, potassium depletion, or certain adrenal gland problems. 
Spironolactone is often effective but it causes tumors in rats, so there are 
questions about its long-term safety. Side effects include drowsiness, 
diarrhea, cramping and menstrual irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
Other medications that may help hirsutism also have potentially serious side 
effects. Antifungal Nizoral (ketoconazole) tablets reduce facial hair growth, 
but many women experience problems such as menstrual disturbances, scalp hair 
loss, nausea, headache or liver conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-androgens developed to treat prostate cancer in men are also being tested 
against hirsutism. They too can produce side effects. 
</P>
<P>
The most promising area of research is on anti-androgens that could be applied 
directly to the skin, minimizing the risk of adverse reactions throughout the 
body.

MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL GIVES ABC TOP RATING; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE 49ERS-GIANTS GAME IS MOST-WATCHED IN HISTORY, ACCORDING TO THE 
NIELSEN SURVEY.

<P>
ABC won the ratings race last week, with a big assist from the most-watched 
game in the history of Monday night football, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time this season that ABC's Monday night football led the 
Nielsen ratings list, and it was watched by 41,550,000 viewers, according to 
ABC. The game had a 27.0 rating and a 42 share, which despite the huge audience 
makes it only the second-highest rated Monday night football game. 
</P>
<P>
That honor stays with the Miami Dolphins-Chicago Bears game of Dec. 2, 1985, 
which had a 29.6 rating and a 46 share -- but because ratings points in those 
days represented fewer households, its total audience was 39 million. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor that made ABC tops for the week -- with NBC second and CBS third 
-- was the Sunday movie situation. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "Columbo Goes to College" was the top-rated of the movies, tied for 21st, 
while CBS's "Donor" tied for 23rd and NBC's "Good Cops, Bad Cops" tied for 
58th. 
</P>
<P>
Since "Good Cops, Bad Cops" starred popular actors Ray Sharkey and Ed Asner and 
offered an interesting cops-as-robbers plot, why did it do so badly? One reason 
may be NBC's two-hour disaster, which provided as much lead-in audience as a 
resounding reading of the Los Angeles telephone directory. 
</P>
<P>
It began with a "Chipmunks" special in 84th place, then came "Saved by the 
Bell" in 92nd, followed by an hourlong Robert Redford special that ranked 82nd. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, in that same two-hour time period CBS offered "60 Minutes," which 
came in second in the rankings and had its highest rating of the season, 
followed by "Murder, She Wrote," which ranked sixth. ABC began the period with 
"Life Goes On," which tied for 70th, but followed with its two "America's 
Funniest" shows, which ranked 12th and 13th. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of football and a high-scoring movie gave the week to ABC with 
a 12.7 rating and a 21 share, while NBC had an 11.9 rating and 20 share and CBS 
had an 11.2 rating and a 19 share. 
</P>
<P>
In the highly competitive 12-week-old season-to-date, NBC maintained its lead 
with a 13.1 rating and 22 share, while ABC was just .4 of a rating behind with 
a 12.7 rating and a 21 share, and CBS only .6 of a rating point off the lead 
with a 12.5 rating and a 21 share. 
</P>
<P>
Night-by-night competition saw NBC win Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and 
Saturday, while ABC took Monday and Friday, and CBS captured Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
If the prime-time ratings race is close, the news competition saw ABC break 
away with the widest margin ever between "World News Tonight" and the second 
place news broadcast -- 2.2 ratings points and five share points. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "World News Tonight" was No. 1 for the 48th consecutive week, with a 12.2 
rating and a 23 share. "CBS Evening News" with Dan Rather and "NBC Nightly 
News" with Tom Brokaw tied for second, each with a 10.0 rating an 18 share. 
</P>
<P>
Each ratings point represents about 921,000 households. 
</P>
<P>

JAPAN COMPOSER STANDS IN FOR MOZART

An Austrian group has chosen a Japanese composer's arrangement of a requiem 
left unfinished by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to mark the 200th anniversary of the 
composer's death, it was announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The International Stiftung Mozarteum, an organization devoted to Mozart 
research, chose Shigeaki Saegusa's "Symphonic Concerto for Violin, Viola, Cello 
and Orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
It is to be performed Dec. 5, 1991, the anniversary date. 
</P>
<P>
Saegusa's composition is a completed version of Mozart's unfinished "Requiem 
Mass." For unknown reasons, Mozart was unable to complete the piece he was 
commissioned to write in the summer of 1791. 
</P>
<P>
One of his students, Franz Xavier Sussmayr, completed a version of the work 
after Mozart died later that year. 
</P>
<P>
But, Saegusa said, "Sussmayr's version was written in a style too 'romantic' to 
suit Mozart's composition. . . . The Stiftung Mozarteum asked me to write my 
own version." 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to return to his state of mind," said Saegusa, one of Japan's foremost 
composers of classical music. 
</P>
<P>
He said his composition will be recorded in May and released next August.

Compliment him on his hairy chest. Compliment him on his natty wardrobe. But 
don't call "Godfather III" star Andy Garcia a "Hispanic heartthrob." 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing that I cherish more than my culture and what I am," Garcia 
says in January's Glamour. "But to call me the great Hispanic actor is 
ridiculous; it's racism. They don't call Dustin Hoffman the great 
Jewish-American actor." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's family fled Cuba for Miami in 1961, when he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, 34, who plays Vincent Mancini, the illegitimate son of Sonny Corleone 
in the latest "Godfather" movie, says his Cuban heritage is "the source of my 
strength." But it also has boxed him into Latino roles during his 13-year 
career, which has included parts in "The Untouchables," "Internal Affairs" and 
"Black Rain." 
</P>
<P>
Though his fame is increasing, Garcia's ego apparently is not. 
</P>
<P>
Told that he looks handsome in a tuxedo in the movie, Garcia bowed his head and 
told the interviewer: "Vincent thanks you." Told that the interviewer was also 
fond of his "glorious chest," the actor replied: 
</P>
<P>
"I can't take responsibility for the chest. It's a genetic thing."

KATHY BATES DELIGHTED WITH ROLE AS OBSESSED NURSE

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most terrifying creatures on the big screen this year is the one 
brought to life by Kathy Bates. 
</P>
<P>
The diminutive actress plays an obsessed fan named Annie Wilkes in director Rob 
Reiner's screen version of Stephen King's novel "Misery." 
</P>
<P>
James Caan is writer Paul Sheldon, whose legs and an arm are mutilated in an 
automobile accident. Bates, as Nurse Wilkes, rescues Sheldon and becomes his 
sole link with the outside world as he recuperates in her isolated home high in 
the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bates is required to look her worst throughout the film, she said she 
didn't hesitate when offered the part. 
</P>
<P>
"When my agent called to say Rob wanted me, I told her she'd better read the 
book," Bates said, smiling. "It wasn't exactly a glamorous Hollywood role. 
</P>
<P>
"Rob had seen my work on the stage. Thank goodness he is a theatergoer. I met 
with him, and I was confident I could play the part the way he wanted it. After 
reading a couple of scenes together, he said, 'Well, let's do it.' 
</P>
<P>
"Annie Wilkes is an extremely disturbed woman, and very sad. She's pathetic, a 
woman I wanted to play after reading the book. 
</P>
<P>
"When Rob called out of the blue and told me I had the part if I wanted it, I 
couldn't have been happier. It was Rob who really unlocked all the secrets of 
Annie for me. He put me on the right track of creating someone who was truly 
frightening instead of a monster of some kind. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased with the way it turned out. Stephen King told me he liked it." 
</P>
<P>
Bates until now played small supporting roles in such films as "Men Don't 
Leave," "Arthur 2," "Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean" 
and "Straight Time."
