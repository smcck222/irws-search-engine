FRIENDSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I was drinking my morning coffee, I read Al Martinez's column about the 
friendship of a blind woman and a gay man that began in their high school days 
and ended with his tragic death in an auto accident ("Time and the Deep 
Winters," Metro, Nov. 28). The beautifully written article brought tears to my 
eyes and reminded me of the verse a friend recently enclosed in a little 
thank-you note: "If we had all the earth's riches we could never spend enough 
to buy the treasures the heart finds in a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Thank you, Mr. Martinez, for reminding me what this time of year should really 
be about: extending the hand of human kindness instead of those needless, mad 
dashes to shopping malls for unappreciated Christmas gifts.

MAKING PEACE WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The spirit, if not the mortar, of the Berlin Wall has crumbled, pulling down 
the Iron Curtain with it. President Bush and Soviet President Gorbachev have 
surveyed Europe from their Mediterranean summit, certified the presence of 
Peace in Progress and tightened the deadline for sharp cuts in both nuclear 
missiles and European battle forces. 
</P>
<P>
Times columnist James Flanigan wrote recently that the meltdown of communism in 
East Europe that led to the Malta summit will have a profound effect on the 
world economy, comparable to"the opening of the New Worlds in the 16th 
Century." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere in the United States will the implications of sweeping changes in 
Europe be more important than in Southern California, home of 12 of every 100 
people whose jobs depend on defense-related activities. 
</P>
<P>
But dodging the dislocations in defense industries and seizing the 
opportunities of change in Europe will require Washington to move faster than 
it has so far. 
</P>
<P>
The President's tentative decision to trim about $12 billion from defense next 
fiscal year seems not to be based on any serious guidance about future defense 
needs from the Pentagon. Aviation Week magazine said in a recent editorial that 
the Pentagon's generals and colonels are charting future forces "with a blind 
eye to the sweeping changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
That is difficult to understand. After all, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
declares that the chances of a Soviet attack in Europe are smaller than at any 
time since World War II -- a threat that few analysts took seriously in recent 
years anyway. 
</P>
<P>
If it is difficult to understand, it is impossible to tolerate. Unless the 
Pentagon gives the White House a detailed account of the forces it needs to 
adapt to change soon, Bush should create a national commission and staff to do 
the job. A commission should be asked to analyze both military requirements and 
trade opportunities with the detachment of global thinkers rather than the 
front-line mentality that has dominated Pentagon policy for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
It should consist of creative thinkers in finance like Felix Rohatyn and former 
Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson and any, or all, of the five living former 
Defense secretaries. It should include leaders from the defense complex itself, 
leaders with the broad view of Donald R. Beall, chairman of Rockwell 
International, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Flanigan also wrote that the United States could be a big winner in the New 
World of the 20th Century. But will the winners include the companies that 
out-built the Soviets in bombers, missiles, high-tech communications networks 
and other weapons during 40 years of the Cold War? 
</P>
<P>
In the short term, for example, a low threat of war in Europe means a need for 
fewer troops.This may well mean that there is no role for a giant new C-17 
troop transport now being built by McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach to airlift 
American infantry to Europe on short notice. 
</P>
<P>
It probably means that West Germany will continue to resist deploying 
modernized short-range nuclear missiles. In these and other cases, would the 
companies that would have built the transports and modernized the missiles be 
the big losers in peace? 
</P>
<P>
The answers to that question surely will turn up in Southern California first 
because it not only has more jobs at stake than other parts of the country but 
also is the leading region in aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
The only available study of the consequences for the region of severe defense 
cuts concludes that massive layoffs, plant closings and collapses of defense 
companies are not likely. A five-year examination by the Southern California 
Assn. of Governments concludes that even defense rollbacks on a scale 
considered unthinkable a few short months ago might make life uncomfortable for 
some companies but probably would leave the region's economy generally 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
For Southern California, as for the rest of the nation, economists say that 
benefits of lower defense spending would include falling interest rates as 
reduced defense spending takes pressure off the federal budget and defense 
firms shift some of their resources into producing for the expanding global 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The way we see the future, Southern California need not and should not simply 
be grateful that the best economic projection says it will scrape through an 
outbreak of peace. This area has devoted 50 years providing the industrial 
creativity and energy that made certain that wars the nation could not avoid -- 
first World War II and then the Cold War -- worked in ways that protected 
Americans and their freedoms. It can make peace work, too. 
</P>
<P>
But this region cannot do it alone. California can get itself ready to roll 
with almost any punch and to lend a hand where needed in conversion, as 
Assemblymen John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) and Sam Farr (D-Carmel) will urge 
this morning. But the state cannot set its own defense policy. That must come 
from Washington. The President must demand straight answers immediately on how 
many troops, ships, tanks and planes the nation really needs in the evolving 
New World, and Congress must back him to the hilt. Southern California can take 
it from there.

PHILIPPINE COUP ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As one of the many Filipino immigrants living here in Los Angeles, I am deeply 
saddened by the recent military attempt in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
However, I feel that the Filipino people and the world should not totally 
discredit Aquino. People must understand that the country's economy was at its 
lowest possible point when Aquino took over. The economy has improved by 4% 
since she became president. It took 20 long years for the Filipino people to 
react to all of Marcos' political wrongdoings and corruption. The least they 
can do now to contribute to the country's stability is to give Aquino a break 
and a little more time. 
</P>
<P>
A coup attempt like this only puts the economy further down and discourages 
foreign investors from doing business in the Philippines. What Filipinos should 
work on is the establishment of discipline and unity as a people. There can be 
no growth and progress without these vital factors.

PHILIPPINE COUP ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest coup attempt in the Philippines has failed again. This time, though, 
the coup's underlying message is getting increasingly loud and clear: The Cory 
magic is no more, and it's time to listen to the rebels' demands. At least, 
those legitimate ones. They have two: Stop the widespread corruption in the 
government, and destroy the communist threat. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Corazon Aquino still has the support of the majority of her people, 
but this support has been eroding at an increasingly rapid and alarming pace, 
mainly because of her failure to check corruption in the government. 
</P>
<P>
The prevailing feeling is that there is simply too much corruption, both in the 
civilian government and the military sector, much like the type which 
characterized the 20-year Marcos rule. The late Ferdinand Marcos' lengthy term 
saw the birth and institutionalization of graft and corruption, so much so that 
it regrettably became a way of life among Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, the Aquino administration was seemingly bent on driving 
corruption out of the government service. For a while it was successful, 
primarily due to the effort of those honest people that she appointed to help 
her rid the nation of corruption. A year later, it started to fail miserably, 
largely because Aquino's ruling party decided, for political convenience and to 
achieve some semblance of stability, to take into its fold the very same 
corrupt politicians, feudal lords and military leaders that the Marcos regime 
spawned and coddled. Inevitably then, it became business as usual for these 
corrupt men. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, corruption and the growing communist threat were the two main 
issues Aquino used during her campaign against Marcos in 1986, issues which are 
haunting her now. Fortunately, it is not yet too late for Aquino to restore her 
lost appeal. According to the latest polls, the Filipino people still trust her 
as a person. The polls also disclosed that it is not she, but her close 
relatives and their political cohorts against whom the Filipino people are up 
in arms -- summarily accusing them of rampant corruption and 
influence-peddling.

QUAKE ASSISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the days following the Northern California earthquake, The Salvation 
Army received hundreds of thousands of dollars and literally tons of donated 
items: food, clothing, tents, flashlights and batteries, generators -- the list 
is endless. 
</P>
<P>
To those of you in Southern California who gave so generously, I want to offer 
my sincerest thanks for your support. Already your aid has assisted in helping 
serve over 6,000 meals daily to those left homeless, countless other meals to 
police, firefighters and rescue workers, clothing, tents, blankets and food to 
those in need. One hundred percent of the funds donated for quake relief go 
directly to our ongoing work in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the generosity of Southern Californians, those in Northern 
California are able to rebuild their lives. The need is great and the work 
continues. Because of your help, we are able to bring comfort and assistance to 
our neighbors. May God bless you.

CATHOLIC JUSTICES

<P>
In view of the tremendous pressure being applied by the Catholic Church on all 
abortion related issues, it seems that the five Catholic members of the Supreme 
Court should recuse themselves on all such decisions to avoid even the 
appearance of conflict. Why is there nodiscussion of this?

PHILIPPINE COUP ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What prompts me to write is my support of the democratic system of government 
in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The attempted military coup in the Philippines will soon turn in a mangled mess 
of issues. I am afraid that many will miss the central issue, and it is this: 
The rebellion against the Philippine government is an act against the 
democratic system of government. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 the Filipino people dramatically and at grave risk to their lives chose 
Aquino to be president. They got rid of the Marcos dictatorship and reinstated 
democracy in the Philippines. It is, therefore, not right for these rebels to 
subvert the will of the Filipino people. If the people are dissatisfied with 
the current government, let them speak; let them decide. There are venues for 
change; there is a peaceful system for change. 
</P>
<P>
Bloody rebellions should not be the vehicle for change.

Let's see if I have this right now. The Bush Administration says that its 
military support of the Philippine government to suppress the rebellion was 
legal because international law permits governments under attack to seek 
outside help. But the Nicaraguan government, under attack for eight years, was 
not allowed to seek help from the Soviets or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
And the United States is allowed to take sides in the El Salvador civil war, 
but no one else is allowed to support the other side. 
</P>
<P>
And the Soviet Union should not interfere in the Western Hemisphere, but the 
United States can support the rebels in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
And the government and society of Iran are highly repressive, but the Afghan 
rebels, who will institute a very similar system if they take power, are 
freedom fighters. 
</P>
<P>
And it's a marvelous thing that the Soviet Union has allowed Eastern Europe to 
freely pursue its own path, but the U.S. should not do the same for Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
And union militancy, a multiparty electoral system and social reform are 
wonderful to see in Eastern Europe, but they have no place in the United 
States.

Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner shoved aside Meryl Streep and Roseanne Barr 
in the box office, as Fox's black comedy "The War of the Roses" opened with 
$9.7 million, compared to $3.5 million for the debut of Orion's "She-Devil." 
Both films feature big-name celebrities in marital battles, but in per-screen 
averages, the final count was: Douglas-Turner $7,696, Streep-Barr $2,502. 
Warner Bros.' holiday spoof "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" finished a 
close second to "War of the Roses" with $9.5 million. Universal's "Back to the 
Future Part II" continued to plunge since its record-breaking Thanksgiving 
opening, falling 42% in the box office over its third weekend. 
</P>
<P>
* Transworld's "Triumph of the Spirit," a dramatic look at Auschwitz through 
the eyes of an interred Jewish boxer, opened with $26,167 on two screens in Los 
Angeles and New York.

HUNTER GUILTY ON FOUR COUNTS; JAILED AS 'RISK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A federal jury Monday found Nancy Hoover Hunter guilty of four counts of tax 
evasion, acquitted her of one other tax-related charge, and could not decide on 
the 192 counts of fraud and conspiracy that were at the heart of the 
eight-month trial. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's relatives hugged each other and said, "That's good, that's good," as 
the jury returned its verdict. And Hunter's defense attorney, while arguing 
immediately afterward that Hunter should remain free on bail pending 
sentencing, claimed that federal prosecutors had "lost this case." 
</P>
<P>
Those feelings of joy and victory evaporated moments later, however, when U.S. 
District Judge Earl B. Gilliam, saying Hunter was a flight risk, ordered her to 
jail without bail pending an April 16 sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, her eyes glazed and her steps wooden, was led away by federal marshals 
out a side door of the courtroom. After a moment, she returned, craning her 
neck to look at her family, including her husband, Kenneth Hunter of Santa 
Barbara, who had yelled across the room, "I love you, sweetie!" 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, 51, a former Del Mar mayor who was accused of conspiring to bilk about 
1,500 investors out of $80 million, stood still for a moment, then collapsed, 
apparently having fainted, onto the red-carpeted floor after the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam started to leave the courtroom, and Hunter's niece Sandy Shroeder 
screamed, "Ruthless! He's ruthless!" and yelled at the judge, "How could you do 
this to her?" 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam then ordered spectators and reporters from the courtroom, but, as 
various people went in or out of the room, Hunter could be seen on the floor 
for the next 20 minutes, sagging in the arms of her attorney, Robert Brewer, or 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter faces up to 20 years in federal prison, or five years apiece on each of 
the four counts of tax evasion, Assistant U.S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo told Gilliam. 
Hugo, the lead prosecutor in the case, also told the judge that prosecutors 
intended to refile the 192 counts against Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say anything," Hunter's mother, Virginia Holm, said outside the 
courtroom. "I just can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
The chaotic and emotional sequence of events that followed the jury's verdict, 
delivered on its 15th day of deliberations, capped a trial that began March 28. 
It is believed to be the longest-running criminal case in the history of the 
San Diego federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Hunter stemmed from her role as a top executive in the La 
Jolla investment firm of J. David &amp; Co. from 1979 to 1984, when its checks 
began to bounce and nervous investors forced the firm into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
In all, investors lost about $80 million in the J. David affair, a giant Ponzi 
scheme in which prosecutors alleged that Hunter played an active role. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's defense lawyers, Brewer and Los Angeles lawyer Richard Marmaro, said 
she fell in love with the founder of the firm, J. David (Jerry) Dominelli and 
that love blinded her to any of his illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
Dominelli pleaded guilty in 1985 to four counts of fraud and tax evasion in 
connection with the Ponzi scheme and is serving a 20-year sentence in federal 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1986, federal prosecutors indicted Hunter, charging her with 234 
counts stemming from her involvement in the now-defunct J. David firm. The 
indictment followed Hunter's April, 1986, guilty plea to related state charges 
of conspiring to funnel thousands of dollars -- allegedly J. David funds -- to 
Roger Hedgecock's successful 1983 campaign to become San Diego mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The funds were funneled to Hedgecock's campaign through the Tom Shepard &amp; 
Associates consulting firm, Hunter admitted through her plea. She was sentenced 
to three years' probation, fined $10,000 and ordered to perform 350 hours of 
public service, which she did at the Santa Barbara Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the federal case against Hunter, Gilliam dismissed 37 of the 
counts, leaving 197. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter took the stand for more than a week in late October, claiming she was 
innocent of the state conspiracy charges. She pleaded guilty, she said, only 
because she knew federal prosecutors were "thinking about this trial" and "I 
didn't know if I could go through two things." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's testimony capped the trial's most eventful week. That week, the 
financial editor of the San Diego Union, Don Bauder, clapped his hand to his 
forehead in a gesture of disbelief while Hunter was on the stand, prompting a 
break while Gilliam tried to figure out whether any harm had been done. 
</P>
<P>
He eventually decided jurors had not been improperly influenced by Bauder's 
gestures and ordered the editor to stay away while Hunter was on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
When the case resumed a few days later, and after Hunter had been on the stand 
for a few hours, prosecutor Hugo was stricken with chest pains. She was wheeled 
from the downtown San Diego courthouse on a stretcher and taken to a La Jolla 
hospital, where she was tested and released after a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 197 counts that went to the jury, 192 centered on Hoover's purported 
involvement with the Ponzi scheme, a pyramid under which money from new 
investors is used to pay off earlier investors. 
</P>
<P>
The 192 included charges of conspiracy, mail fraud, commodity pool fraud and 
making a false statement to a federal regulator. Specifically, prosecutors 
charged that Hunter played an active role in the giant scheme, creating false 
documents both to lure investors to J. David and then to lull them into staying 
put while the firm headed toward bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
It was those 192 charges that stymied the panel. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication, either in the notes the jury sent Gilliam or in any 
comments he made, of any votes the panel might have taken on those counts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a very complex case and that made it very difficult for us," 
juror John Thomas Posey Jr. of National City said outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
In a note sent to Gilliam early in the panel's deliberations, juror Dorothy 
Andre, 62, of San Diego, told the judge that the jury room was a "very hostile 
place." 
</P>
<P>
"At first it was," Posey said. "Somewhat. Somewhat. Not excessively." 
</P>
<P>
Another juror, Arlene Fink, 32, of San Diego, said the trial was "an 
interesting experience," but declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Most jurors tried to elude reporters by leaving the courthouse through a 
stairway. Several said they had decided not to talk to the press. 
</P>
<P>
The jury convicted Hunter of tax evasion in connection with her personal tax 
returns for the years 1980 through 1983. It acquitted her of aiding and 
abetting in the filing of a false 1980 J. David partnership return. 
</P>
<P>
After the judge dismissed the jury, Hugo argued that Hunter was a flight risk 
pending sentencing, saying it was "apparent (Hunter) has the financial means to 
go anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
"The jury chose to disbelieve (Hunter's) testimony as it relates to her tax 
evasion and the money she received from Dominelli," Hugo said. "Inasmuch as she 
lied on the witness stand, she cannot be trusted to tell the truth that if she 
was released pending sentencing, she would not flee." 
</P>
<P>
Brewer, however, said the verdict was a "total repudiation of the Ponzi scheme" 
charges, adding, "The government wants to put her into custody because they 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, who had been free on $100,000 bail, had shown up for every court 
appearance since she had been indicted, Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
It would be "absolutely ludicrous and cruel to the worst degree to ask that 
this woman be placed in custody at this time, two weeks before Christmas," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, however, ordered her to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center 
without bail, concluding that Hunter "is a flight risk." 
</P>
<P>
There was "evidence in the case of her moving around the world" and having the 
ability to "live comfortably," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam also ordered that a gag order he imposed on the attorneys in the case 
-- keeping them from talking about it with reporters -- stay in effect until 
after the April 16 sentencing.

Police officials in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., met with black leaders to discuss the 
apparent accidental shooting of an unarmed black man by a white policeman 
during a drug search. Black leaders later told reporters they were satisfied 
with the way the case was being handled. Patrick Lavon Lee, 28, was shot in the 
back of the head in a predominantly black neighborhood by police officer Robert 
Thomas McCabe. Lee was in critical condition at Broward General Medical Center 
and was not expected to recover, doctors said. The shooting was the second 
involving a police officer and an unarmed suspect in South Florida since a 
Miami jury last week convicted police officer William Lozano of manslaughter in 
the deaths of two black men.

A Navstar navigation satellite was rocketed into orbit from Cape Canaveral, 
Fla., to join a network of spacecraft that guide bombers, warships, missiles 
and ground troops with great accuracy. A 128-foot-tall Air Force Delta 2 rocket 
boosted the $65-million satellite into orbit after the liftoff was delayed a 
day because of a problem with a fuel tank pressurization system. The Navstar 
satellites enable U.S. and allied military units to determine their positions

A man charged with 27 counts of murder as a result of a bus crash last year had 
not been drinking heavily the day of the accident, relatives and a friend 
testified as the defense opened its case in Carrollton, Ky. The defendant, 
Larry Mahoney, 36, of Worthville, admits drinking the day of the crash, driving 
on the wrong side of Interstate 71 and striking the loaded church bus. But the 
defense maintains that the 27 victims were killed because the bus was unsafe. 
The fuel tank of the bus owned by the Radcliff First Assembly of God church 
exploded, sending flames throughout the bus carrying 67 people home from an 
outing.

Charles Warren, a member of the state Coastal Commission and a former 
assemblyman, is expected to be named top executive of the State Lands 
Commission. After serving in the Legislature for 14 years, Warren was appointed 
in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter to be chairman of the President's Council on 
Environmental Quality. He was named to the Coastal Commission by Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). As a Democratic assemblyman 
representing Los Angeles, he was the principal author of the Coastal Protection 
Act. In his new post, he would continue to serve on the Coastal Commission. 
Warren's background has made him popular among environmental groups. And his 
appointment appears to be another signal that the Lands Commission intends to 
continue to play an activist role on environmental issues.

Supporters of an initiative to have an independent commission redraw political 
district boundaries said they filed enough signatures to qualify the measure 
for the June, 1990, statewide ballot. The initiative would strip the 
Legislature of the power to redistrict, giving it to a 12-member commission 
made up of five Democrats, five Republicans and two persons not registered in 
either party. Sponsored by the League of Women Voters and other groups, the 
initiative is the first of six measures originally targeted for the ballot to 
be submitted to the secretary of state with signatures. A spokeswoman for the 
office said it appears that only four of the six remain active, however. 
Supporters of the initiative said they submitted 965,000 signatures. A total of 
595,000 valid signatures are needed to put the measure on the ballot.

VICTIM TO RECEIVE HER MOLESTER'S PENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old San Diego girl won a court settlement Monday that enables her to 
pay her therapy bills by collecting the monthly pension of the retired state 
worker convicted of molesting her. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Michael I. Greer approved the settlement under 
which the girl will receive $10,000 paid to convicted molester Colby W. 
Flaherty, 67, by the state Public Employees Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
The case appears to be the first pitting the right of restitution provided for 
victims by the state Constitution against a state law that says public 
retirement benefits are exempt from collection by others. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 1982 constitutional amendment dubbed the "Victim's Bill of Rights" 
gives crime victims an "unequivocal" restitution right, it does not say how 
victims should secure that money, according to William A. Fogel, the San Diego 
attorney representing the girl. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty happy about it because she's got a lot of therapy bills and no 
help," Fogel said. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement means Greer compared the laws and decided that the 
constitutional provision was more important than the state law, Fogel said. 
</P>
<P>
It also means that the judge found this was a situation in which "people 
shouldn't be allowed to hide behind technical exemptions, as if they'd made a 
bad business deal, when in fact they've gone around and destroyed people's 
lives," Fogel said. 
</P>
<P>
Flaherty, a retired California Department of Transportation supervisor who 
lived in Loma Portal, was sentenced last year to 12 years in state prison for 
molesting the girl. He pleaded guilty in October, 1988, to oral copulation with 
a girl under 14 and to six counts of employing the girl to perform lewd acts 
that were photographed. 
</P>
<P>
Flaherty was arrested after police received a tip that he had been molesting 
the girl, a neighbor, for two years. He first lured her into his house with 
promises of candy, police said. 
</P>
<P>
At Flaherty's sentencing, San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez, in 
addition to imposing the maximum prison term, ordered Flaherty to pay the girl 
$10,000. That money was needed to pay the girl's medical and therapy bills, 
Fogel said. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was sent to the medium-security state prison in Ione, the only 
significant asset with which Flaherty could make restitution was his state 
pension, Fogel said. 
</P>
<P>
Flaherty's pension is $364.20 a month, a pension system official said after 
Fogel filed suit Sept. 5 seeking to tap the funds. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, Greer ordered that funds that had been frozen pending his 
decision -- about $1,000, Fogel said -- be paid to the girl within 15 days. In 
addition, future payments are to be turned over, through Fogel, to the girl 
until the amount reaches $10,000, Greer ordered. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, Fogel agreed that he would forgo any fees for his work on the 
case.

CONGRESSMAN SAYS POSTMASTER NEEDN'T BE FIRED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
After the first field hearing ever conducted by a congressional subcommittee 
into the operations of a local post office, Rep. Frank McCloskey (D-Ind.) said 
Monday that San Diego County Postmaster Margaret Sellers has areas to be 
improved but doesn't deserve to be fired. 
</P>
<P>
"After all that I have heard, and it's a lot, I would say she's too aloof and 
too bottom-line-oriented, and I advise her to do better," said McCloskey, 
chairman of the House Subcommittee on Postal Operations and Services. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, which was marked by emotional testimony from postal workers 
and occasional outbursts of cheers and applause, Sellers said she felt 
vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never felt my job was on the line," said Sellers, 56, who became 
postmaster in 1979 and remained in charge throughout the county's stunning 
growth during the past decade. "I thought it was a fair hearing, and I'll try 
to look into all of the things that surfaced here today. I'll try to make 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to elaborate, Sellers waved off her questioners and moved outside. At one 
point, however, she responded to a question about job security as she headed 
toward the door. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel secure in my job, but rather I feel secure in my position with 
the Postal Service. I work for (Postmaster General Anthony) Frank, and I 
believe he supports me wholeheartedly." 
</P>
<P>
One of Frank's top lieutenants, Assistant Postmaster General Joseph J. Mahon 
Jr., testified with Sellers during the five-hour hearing. He and Sellers 
defended the district's track record, using such words as productivity and 
efficiency and speaking of the need to cut costs during an era marked by 
retrenchment and phenomenal growth. 
</P>
<P>
At the behest of Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego), McCloskey chaired Monday's 
session at the Federal Building downtown to examine in detail postal operations 
in the county and, specifically, Sellers' leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Bates said he had received thousands of letters from disgruntled postal workers 
after an Escondido letter carrier, John Merlin Taylor, went on an August 
shooting rampage, in which he killed his wife and two co-workers, then turned 
the gun on himself. The four deaths brought to eight the postal-related 
killings or suicides in San Diego County in eight months. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, McCloskey and Rep. Charles Hayes (D-Ill.), chairman of the House 
Subcommittee on Postal Personnel and Modernization, lauded Sellers for her 
accomplishments as an organizer and cost-cutter, but seemed to find her lacking 
in relating to people. 
</P>
<P>
"It was some good reality testing," Bates said after the hearing. "Like all of 
us, Sellers has done some good things, and then there are definite areas for 
improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Bates said Monday's hearing marked the first time in the history of Congress 
that a subcommittee had made an inquiry into the operations of a local post 
office. He said further hearings are possible, but none are planned. He did 
note, however, that McCloskey will come to San Diego in two months to 
reappraise the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing room on the fourth floor of the Federal Building was packed, with 
all 111 seats taken and hundreds of postal workers waiting outside. Most never 
got in. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Hayes, a large man with a thundering voice, strode to the hallway 
and apologized -- loudly and oratorically -- that "all of you people got left 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Space wasn't the only problem. No court reporter was available when the session 
started at 1:30 p.m., so actual testimony did not begin for at least another 
hour. The "court reporter" ended up being a postal worker who volunteered the 
microphone from his video camera to record the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
On several occasions, postal workers chastised management personnel for what 
McCloskey later referred to as "winning-through-intimidation" approaches, "in 
the tradition of Captain Bligh," which he said had to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not waving any magic wands here today," McCloskey said more than once, 
"but we can highlight some problems and talk about them." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the recommended solutions include fewer bosses and more workers, more 
lenient hours for overtime, rerouting of routes, curtailing of so-called Third 
Class "junk" mail and, above all, more democratic means of settling grievances 
and on-the-job differences. 
</P>
<P>
Bates in particular took pains to point out the "tremendous hostility" between 
workers and management and pointed to "martinet supervisors" who resort to 
"intimidation, pressure and pettiness toward employees." 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between labor and management "is clearly adversarial," he 
said, adding that the grievance process is "seriously flawed." 
</P>
<P>
He called the atmosphere in Sellers' domain "Orwellian." 
</P>
<P>
"There is real stress here," McCloskey said. "That much is obvious. But we're 
an oversight group, and I think we got some valuable things on the table. 
There's so many problems, but I hope we can inspire everyone to be better."

WITH DUFFY OUT, IT'S A WIDE-OPEN RACE FOR SHERIFF; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: THE STRATEGY WILL CHANGE MARKEDLY AS THE FIELD OF CANDIDATES TRIES TO 
FIND A NEW CAMPAIGN FOCUS. 
</P>

<P>
By deciding not to seek reelection, San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy has 
dramatically altered the complexion of next year's race, changing it from a 
referendum on his controversial stewardship to a confusing scramble among a 
handful of candidates whose major target is suddenly gone. 
</P>
<P>
Within political circles, Duffy's unexpected announcement Monday that he will 
retire when his term expires in January, 1991, was seen as the electoral 
equivalent of sharply flicking a gyroscope with one's finger -- an action that 
abruptly shifted the campaign's axis, sending it careening off in wildly 
unpredictable directions. 
</P>
<P>
"With Big John gone, it's a whole new game," said political consultant Jack 
Orr, who is managing the campaign of former San Diego Police Chief Ray Hoobler. 
"Now, you could flip a coin five ways and still not be able to predict who's 
going to be sheriff. This thing is wide, wide open." 
</P>
<P>
The immediate impact of Duffy's withdrawal will be to force the three announced 
sheriff candidates -- each of whom has sharply criticized Duffy and planned to 
keep him in their rhetorical cross hairs throughout the campaign -- to quickly 
rethink their strategies. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, each realizes that his chances of qualifying for a November 
runoff have been improved -- for statistical if not political reasons -- by the 
removal of Duffy, whose countywide name recognition easily eclipsed that of his 
would-be challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Orr also speculated that Duffy's decision could lessen public interest in the 
race by relegating its most colorful figure to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"Duffy's removed a lot of the fire for this race," Orr conceded. "If he ran, we 
were going to see some good aerial fights. Now we're down to trench warfare." 
</P>
<P>
The potential effect of Duffy's endorsement Monday of one of his three 
assistant sheriffs, Jack Drown, was also briskly debated, with the consensus 
being that Drown perhaps has more to lose than gain from the sheriff's backing. 
Already closely identified with Duffy, Drown -- who plans to formally announce 
his candidacy in several weeks -- could be seriously damaged if he is perceived 
to be the handpicked successor of a sheriff who is leaving office enveloped in 
controversy, campaign consultants said. 
</P>
<P>
"Does this guy want to win?" consultant David Lewis, whose firm is not involved 
in the race, asked when told that Drown welcomed Duffy's endorsement. "At this 
point, I'd be real (reluctant) about taking any help from Duffy. At the very 
least, I'd have wanted to wait until later in the race to see how the public's 
feeling about him." 
</P>
<P>
While Drown tries to quickly organize a race that he thought was at least four 
years away -- a timetable based on his expectation that Duffy would seek 
reelection -- Hoobler and the two other announced candidates began assessing 
Monday how Duffy's decision affects their candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
No longer able to bill themselves simply as an alternative to Duffy, the three 
-- Hoobler, Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache and Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno 
-- must now develop a plan to make their candidacies compelling, a task made 
much more difficult by the removal of their foil. In short, each must repackage 
his own positive attributes for the job rather than simply hope to capitalize 
on the anybody-but-Duffy sentiment that had been expected to be a dominant 
theme in next year's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Without Duffy in the race, the candidates "will not have the opportunity . . . 
to address the performance of the incumbent," Hoobler said. 
</P>
<P>
"The obvious target is gone," Lewis added. "They're all going to have to 
refocus and find other things to talk about. At the same time, there still are 
plenty of problems in the Sheriff's Department -- the jails, the low morale -- 
to discuss. But, with Duffy out of it, a lot of the emotion from that debate is 
gone, too." 
</P>
<P>
In announcing that he will not seek an unprecedented sixth four-year term, 
Duffy displayed the same public bravado, cockiness and caustic disdain for his 
critics that typified much of his tenure as the county's top law-enforcement 
officer. Despite growing dissatisfaction with his performance -- as reflected 
in a Times poll last spring in which only 28% of those surveyed favored his 
reelection -- Duffy predicted Monday that he could have easily defeated the 
"jackals" planning to challenge him next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe very strongly that I could defeat any and all of the jackals who 
haven't the courage to kill their own prey but rely upon others to provide them 
something to feed upon," Duffy said at a morning news conference in his 
downtown office. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to identify the "jackals," Duffy added: "Vincent Jimno, who said he would 
never run for sheriff until after I've retired. Now he tells me he thinks that 
I'm weakened, and it's a good time for him to run. Roache is the same way. 
They're jackals -- the lowest animal in the jungle. They're worse than 
vultures." 
</P>
<P>
Roache could not be reached for comment Monday, but Jimno said he doubts that 
Duffy's acrimony is "anything to worry about" in his campaign. Similarly, 
Hoobler consultant Orr suggested that being singled out for criticism from 
Duffy "might not be a bad thing" for those seeking to succeed him, whereas his 
endorsement poses some thorny questions. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, is this an endorsement you really want?" Orr asked 
rhetorically. "After all, it's coming from a guy who's not leaving under the 
best of circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Drown, however, said at his own news conference Monday that Duffy's endorsement 
"is not an evil thing," adding that he is not concerned about being tainted by 
his close association with the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see it as a problem," Drown said. "I'm encouraged by the fact that the 
man I've worked for for going on 21 years has that kind of confidence in me. 
Certainly, I'm not going to shun his support, there's no question about that." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the recent criticism of Duffy, Drown said, has "focused not so much on 
the operations of the department (as on Duffy's) personal style, his relations 
with other elected officials, his relations with . . . the media." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's level of involvement in his campaign, Drown said, is "something that I 
have to leave up to him." Pressed on whether he will ask Duffy to play a 
high-visibility role in the race, Drown added: "I would not reject John Duffy's 
support. I'd say, whatever you can do for me, I'd welcome." 
</P>
<P>
Jimno, however, speculated that any association with Duffy could be a liability 
for any candidate next year -- particularly so for Drown. 
</P>
<P>
Making the case for his own candidacy as an "outsider . . . with a proven track 
record," Jimno, who became Escondido's chief in 1987 after seven years as 
Carlsbad's police chief, argued that Roache, too, could face tough questions 
simply by virtue of his service under Duffy -- even though he has been one of 
the sheriff's most vocal internal critics. 
</P>
<P>
"A major concern for voters is going to be whether these other candidates are 
cut from the same cloth or have been trained to do things in the same way over 
the past 20 years," said Jimno, who has taken a leave of absence to campaign 
for sheriff and now is acting as a paid consultant to the Escondido Police 
Department. "The fact that I'm outside the department is a definite advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Hoobler, too, can make the same claim, but even his own consultant conceded 
Monday that Duffy's departure from the race so thoroughly changes the 
campaign's dynamics as to make any hypotheses about an election that is still 
six months away rather hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
Having said that, however, Orr speculated that Duffy's exit could make fund 
raising a stiffer challenge for the remaining candidates. Many potential 
contributors, he said, perhaps cared more about seeing Duffy replaced than 
about which candidate did so -- and feel they have already accomplished that 
goal without needing to open their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, most people can say, 'Problem solved -- thorn removed,' " Orr 
said. "For them, the campaign's over, in a way. But for the rest of us, it's 
just beginning."

AIDES PONDER BRADLEY DEMANDS ON PORTER RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to Mayor Tom Bradley's warning last week that he would veto the 
proposed Porter Ranch development if it is not changed to his satisfaction, 
aides to Bradley and City Councilman Hal Bernson said Monday they are near 
agreement on all but one of the mayor's suggested changes. 
</P>
<P>
"They see eye to eye on a lot of it," said Jane Blumenfeld, the mayor's 
planning adviser. "It's just a matter of working out the specifics. The 
concepts they mutually agree on." 
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting of the City Council's Planning and Land-Use Management 
Committee should reveal more about Bernson's willingness to compromise on the 
project to mollify Bradley, who chose last Friday to discuss in public the 
concerns his staff had raised with the Porter Ranch developer as early as 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills developer Nathan Shapell's $2-billion proposal for 2,195 
single-family homes, 1,200 townhouses and nearly 6 million square feet of 
commercial space in the hills north of the Simi Valley Freeway is scheduled to 
be heard today by the planning committee, which Bernson chairs. The 
development, which would be in Bernson's district, would be the largest in the 
city's history. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the council and at a news conference Friday, Bradley urged 
several changes in the plan, such as inclusion of affordable housing and an 
internal transit system. Bradley also called for distribution of neighborhood 
retail stores throughout the project's residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson was not available for comment Monday but his chief deputy, Greig Smith, 
predicted that nine of Bradley's 10 suggested changes can be resolved in 
committee hearings. The lone sticking point for Bernson, he said, was Bradley's 
recommendation that the amount of parking in the project's office complex be 
cut in half in order to promote ride-sharing and public transit. 
</P>
<P>
Some form of an internal transit system, the planting of trees, the 
installation of dual plumbing in office buildings to promote the use of 
reclaimed water and programs for recycling and yard composting all can be 
included, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Of Bradley's recommendation for affordable housing, Smith said: "We'll have to 
probably live with something on that issue. I don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley rarely has intervened in a development issue before council action on 
it. Bradley aides said Friday's news conference signaled a willingness by the 
mayor to become more involved in local planning matters. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's letter to the council said he had "reservations" about the 
1.5-million-square-foot regional shopping mall that would be part of the Porter 
Ranch development. But the letter did not call for specific reductions in a 
proposed mall, or in the overall size of the commercial complex, where office 
buildings would be as high as 10 stories. 
</P>
<P>
"What the mayor did really wasn't that significant in terms of the 
development," said one city planning official familiar with the project. The 
official, speaking on the condition that he not be named, added: "If he really 
wanted to come down on it, the main issue is transportation and the amount of 
commercial (development). . . . I found most of the things, with the exception 
of the parking, pretty cosmetic stuff."

LAB OWNER WHO SUPPLIED DRUG DEALERS GETS 40-YEAR PRISON TERM, $250,000 FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A laboratory owner who sold glassware and chemicals to drug dealers was 
sentenced to 40 years in federal prison Monday and fined $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Saying Robert Miskinis is partly to blame for San Diego being described as the 
"methamphetamine capital of the United States," U.S. District Judge Howard 
Turrentine imposed the 40-year term sought by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Miskinis, 40, of El Cajon owned RJM Laboratories in Lakeside and Safe Labs in 
Santee before the labs were seized and he was arrested in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted of operating a continuing criminal enterprise and on 10 counts 
of aiding and abetting in the manufacture of methamphetamine and aiding 
interstate travel in aid of racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendant no doubt was the largest seller of the ingredients of 
methamphetamine," Turrentine said. "Our little town acquired the title of the 
methamphetamine capital of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The sentence is one of the longest given to someone convicted of drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Miskinis' customers are now in prison themselves. Among them are 
brothers Manuel and Jack Battaglia, serving 20- and 29-year terms, 
respectively, for distributing methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
Under new federal sentencing guidelines, Assistant U.S. Atty. Pat Swan said, 
Miskinis will have to serve 80% of the sentence, or 34 years, before being 
eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a well-deserved sentence," Swan said. 
</P>
<P>
In court, Swan described Miskinis as having an "insatiable appetite for the 
holy dollar." 
</P>
<P>
"He made San Diego the methamphetamine capital of the U.S.," Swan said. "He 
structured his entire business to suit (drug dealers') business. For his 
assistance, he made a fortune." 
</P>
<P>
In an Aug. 19, 1988, raid, federal agents seized Miskinis' house, business, 
equipment, patents, bank accounts and retirement funds. In court, his former 
attorney, John Mitchell, estimated the value of the seized assets at $4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Miskinis' new attorney, Joseph Milchen, urged the judge to impose the minimum 
sentence of 10 years in prison for the continuing criminal enterprise count. 
</P>
<P>
Miskinis read a lengthy statement in court criticizing Mitchell's efforts in 
the August trial. Turrentine responded that Mitchell provided "an excellent 
defense" for Miskinis. 
</P>
<P>
Miskinis was convicted Aug. 30.

ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS

<P>
Receiving junk phone calls at home or at work is one thing, but. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A few hours after Judy Graeme gave birth to 8-pound Sean Rose at Tarzana 
Medical Center, the phone rang in her room. The cheery female voice on the 
other end said, "Hi! Congratulations!" and went on to say that Graeme was now 
eligible for a gift. 
</P>
<P>
The caller asked for the new mom's home phone number. But when the solicitor, 
instead, was asked for her phone number, her cheeriness evaporated and she hung 
up. 
</P>
<P>
At least it wasn't a door-to-door pitch. 
</P>
<P>
What if they gave a protest and everyone came -- to the wrong address? 
</P>
<P>
About 90 members of Pesticide Watch and other anti-malathion groups showed up 
at a Wilshire-area building the other day to picket the local offices of Gov. 
George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Only problem was, the Guv had moved downtown in August, the same month 
(coincidentally) that authorities rained malathion on the Wilshire area. 
</P>
<P>
(Downtown hasn't been sprayed yet, its many fruit trees having avoided 
contamination.) 
</P>
<P>
"He fled the spray zone," demonstration organizer David Bunn said of 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
And the protest? Well, since they'd gone to all the trouble, they held it at 
the old address anyway. But the protesters faced downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Should Long Beach's new logo get the heave-ho? 
</P>
<P>
A survey taken by the Long Beach Weekly Seabreeze found Beachites favored, by a 
2-1 margin, sacking the new skyscrapers/waves symbol in favor of the old 
design, which featured such lost landmarks as the Rainbow Pier and the old 
Municipal Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"The new logo looks like Long Beach is sinking into the waves after the next 
earthquake," wrote one reader, possibly recalling the city's 1933 shaker. 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous city employee commented that the new logo "implies that all there 
is to Long Beach is its business development. Why not a big dollar sign, 
instead?" The new symbol, chosen over more than 100 other entries, was 
announced a couple of months late, sparking rumors that the judges were not 
overwhelmed with any of the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
City officials felt that the old logo -- dating back to 1930 -- needed 
replacing, because it puts Long Beach's incorporation date at 1897, which might 
lead one to wonder why the city celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1988. Also, 
the old logo contains the Latin motto, Urbs Amicitiae ("The Friendly City"). 
That title is claimed by nearby Bellflower. And, when it comes to a stolen 
motto, there are limits to Bellflower's friendliness.

It might seem hard to believe, but there was a time in Southern California when 
junk mail from real estate agents wasn't so plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1860s, the bottom fell out of the market after a drought virtually wiped 
out the cattle industry and left many land barons impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
At a sheriff's sale of confiscated downtown property, held 125 years ago today, 
there were no takers for lots on the corners of Main and 5th streets, Spring 
and 5th streets, and Broadway and 4th street. 
</P>
<P>
The price was the amount of unpaid real estate taxes owed on each lot, 
according to author Oliver Carlson ("Mirror for Californians"). The lack of 
interest was understandable. Back taxes amounted to 63 cents for each parcel.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BLACK PICKED FOR CITY POST IN WAKE OF BIAS 
PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of protests by the NAACP that blacks are not represented in top 
administrative posts in Carson city government, City Administrator Jack Smith 
has chosen a black woman, Lorraine A. Oten, as finance director. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Oten, whose salary range in her new job is $60,000 to $77,000, "was 
selected solely on her experience and skills." But he added that he is pleased 
that Oten, who is leaving a position as finance director of Lynwood, will add 
balance to Carson's administrative team. 
</P>
<P>
"It does something to appease a segment of our community who were crying out 
for more representation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Carson city government, four white men and an Asian man are the other 
appointed department heads. Smith is white and the deputy city administrator is 
an Asian man. The elected city clerk is an Asian woman, and the elected city 
treasurer is a white woman.

JURY SEES TAPE OF BROWN AFTER DEPROGRAMMING; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: DEFENSE LAWYERS IN THE KIDNAPING CASE ATTEMPT TO SHOW THAT THE ALLEGED 
VICTIM WAS LAUGHING ABOUT HER PARENTS' DEPROGRAMMING ATTEMPT, AND NOT MENTALLY 
SHAKEN AS SHE INSISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Defense attorneys, trying to impeach Ginger Brown's testimony that she was 
terrorized and feared for her life during a five-day deprogramming attempt last 
year, showed a videotape Monday of the woman giggling, laughing and joking 
about the experience hours after she was released by her parents. 
</P>
<P>
The video was taped by fellow members of Great Among the Nations, who had a 
practice of taping virtually every one of their group meetings and who taped 
Brown as she talked to the group about her experience. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was ordered to turn over about 20 hours of tapes to defense lawyers two 
weeks ago. Excerpts were shown to the jury Monday, with the defense hoping her 
comments and general demeanor would belie her characterization to jurors of the 
deprogramming effort, in which she said she was beaten and verbally abused. 
</P>
<P>
Although the audio was of poor quality, Brown could be heard laughing about the 
ordeal and talking about how she coped during the five days, partly by 
recalling old jokes between her and her friends about deprogrammers. 
</P>
<P>
That scene brought a smile to Ginger Brown as she sat on the witness stand, 
watching the video monitor. 
</P>
<P>
The tape also showed the group's leader, Benjamin Altschul, encouraging Brown 
to seek the prosecution of her parents and others involved in the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to prosecute," Altschul said to Brown. "I'll be very disappointed 
if you don't. What is your intent?" 
</P>
<P>
"To prosecute everybody, totally," Brown answered Altschul. 
</P>
<P>
Altschul then emphasized the need to get publicity about the bruises Brown said 
she suffered during her capture from an Encinitas parking lot and later during 
the deprogramming effort in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
"Every bruise will go on TV," Altschul said. "Every bruise. We need to take 
pictures of these bruises and put them on TV. The public needs to know." 
</P>
<P>
The next scene showed Altschul saying, "I want $100,000 for this," apparently 
alluding to the prospect of a civil lawsuit against Ginger Brown's parents and 
others. Such a lawsuit was later filed. 
</P>
<P>
And, in comments that were contrary to her own courtroom testimony Monday, 
Brown said on the tape that her abductors made her the offer of spending six 
months at a home in the San Francisco area where she could rest and "do 
research." 
</P>
<P>
Brown had testified early Monday that, while she was held captive, she was 
given only two options: to disavow her allegiance to Great Among the Nations or 
to be admitted to a psychiatric facility near San Francisco for a six-month 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Gary Rempel objected to the showing of the video excerpts, 
complaining that they were out of context and, as a result, could not be used 
to impeach the testimony of Brown, who is the chief witness against the five 
defendants: her parents, Earle and Dorothy Brown; her sister, Holly Brown; Hank 
Erler, at whose mother's home the deprogramming effort transpired, and Cliff 
Daniels, a self-described cult deprogrammer. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge David B. Moon Jr. told the jury to disregard some parts of 
the tape -- including Altschul's mention of $100,000, and a reference by Brown 
that she found Erler attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Weston, Holly Brown's attorney, who introduced the tape after it was 
surrendered by Brown 10 days ago for review by defense attorneys, said the 
tapes showed Ginger Brown mocking the deprogramming effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so important what she said, but, by the laughing, the whole thing was 
a joke to her," he said outside the courtroom. "The jury is not getting the 
whole story." 
</P>
<P>
During his cross-examination of Brown, Weston asked her why she didn't call 911 
for police when she had access to a telephone. Brown said she believed the 
phone that she hid under her bed was a cellular phone and that police would 
only be able to track it to Los Angeles. Only now, in court, did she realize it 
was a cordless home phone, Brown said.

AL MARTINEZ: HILL STREET BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I were walking down Hill Street near the Jewelry Mart when she 
stopped dead in her tracks and looked at me. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you realize," she said, "how often you hum?" 
</P>
<P>
"What?" 
</P>
<P>
"You hum." 
</P>
<P>
"I do?" 
</P>
<P>
She nodded, trying to smile, though I could see it was difficult for her. 
</P>
<P>
"You hum these tuneless things whenever you're walking or driving. Sometimes 
you even hum when you read." 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't realized that," I said. "I'm a happy person, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
"No," she said thoughtfully, "you're not. You've never been a happy person. The 
kind of humming you do has nothing to do with happiness. It's really sort of . 
. . you know . . . pointless, like a dog barking at the wind." 
</P>
<P>
Having gotten that off her chest, she said cheerfully, "Well, shall we go into 
the Jewelry Mart?" 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute," I said, following her inside. "Like a dog barking at the 
wind?" 
</P>
<P>
"I meant it constructively," she said, trying on a ring. "Sometimes if we 
realize what our annoying habits are, we can correct them." Then she added, 
"Before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
It hit me like a bolt of lightning. "The War of the Roses." We had seen the 
movie the night before and she had been acting funny ever since. 
</P>
<P>
I stood back slightly. Her next move might be to smash me in the face. 
</P>
<P>
For those who have missed the film, it's about a marriage that spirals from 
sweetness to divorce. Everyone in L.A. is talking about it. Michael Douglas and 
Kathleen Turner are Oliver and Barbara Rose, the happy couple who end up 
destroying each other. 
</P>
<P>
Their acrimony evolves in stages. Barbara, for instance, becomes slowly aware 
of Oliver's annoying mannerisms. One is that he bobs his head happily when he 
eats and chews to a silent rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver, of course, is unaware of this harmless trait, but it doesn't escape his 
increasingly hostile wife. She sits across the table and glares at him. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at a dinner party, she is offended by his laugh and that night calls him 
a name I have never before heard a woman call a man. 
</P>
<P>
From then on, it's Katie bar the door. 
</P>
<P>
"Roses" is a marvelous movie, but I am worried about its impact on my wife and 
on the relationships of other couples who comprise our small but genial social 
circle. It seems to say that husbands are boorish and it is therefore OK to 
attack them. 
</P>
<P>
We were at a party the other night talking about "Roses," for example, when 
midway through the conversation, our good friend Eva leaned over to our other 
good friend Fred, her husband, and said, "You're slurping, dear." 
</P>
<P>
Fred's reaction was similar to mine when I was told I hummed. He said, "Huh?" I 
didn't say huh, but Fred is an actor and an actor's grip on culture and 
unscripted conversation is tenuous at best. 
</P>
<P>
"Try not to slurp when you drink," Eva said, patting him gently on the arm. 
Fred shrugged and went right on drinking, and slurping. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, he interrupted Eva's monologue and said, "Maybe someone 
else would like to get a word in edgewise." 
</P>
<P>
She said, "I beg your pardon?" Eva is a teacher and understands the value of 
manners, but is inclined toward verbosity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that you tend to dominate the conversation," Fred said pleasantly. 
"You're a strong person, Evie." 
</P>
<P>
Eva smiled, but there was murder in her eyes. "I've asked you not to call me 
Evie," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Back to Hill Street. My wife and I were there in the first place so I could 
research a column on the changing face of downtown. The new high-rises, the new 
restaurants, the remodeled and elegant old Biltmore, the expanded and enticing 
Jewelry Mart. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown is becoming a place to go, from the Garment District to Olvera Street. 
Even Pic 'n' Save is appearing more colorful than sleazy. 
</P>
<P>
But after being compared to a dog barking at the wind, I was naturally more 
interested in vengeance than in researching a column. 
</P>
<P>
I was grumbling and hurrying to catch up with my wife when it occurred to me 
that she never waited for me when we shopped. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is it," I demanded triumphantly, "you surge ahead without regard to my 
whereabouts when we are in crowds?" 
</P>
<P>
"I knew you'd come back with something," she said. "I could hear you grumbling. 
Well, not grumbling exactly, but muttering. You have this way of muttering to 
yourself. It's almost a growl." 
</P>
<P>
"A growl?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's all right, dear," she said, kissing my cheek. "I love you anyhow. Come 
along." 
</P>
<P>
She took off through the crowds. I shrugged and followed, humming and muttering 
and realizing I had lost the war a long time ago, and we are very happy, thank 
you.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PRIESTESS GETS 360 DAYS FOR PROBATION 
VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted prostitute who says she has had intercourse with 2,000 men as the 
high priestess of an ancient sex-worshiping church was sentenced in Los Angeles 
Monday to 360 days in jail for a probation violation. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Tracy, 46, the self-proclaimed high priestess, was found by 
Municipal Judge Marion Obera to have violated her probation because of her 
arrest Nov. 14 on suspicion of pandering. Tracy immediately posted bail to 
avoid going to jail while the city attorney's office determines whether it will 
file a misdemeanor charge against her stemming from the Nov. 14 arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Obera on Sept. 22 placed Tracy on three years' probation and sentenced her to 
90 days in County Jail after she was convicted of operating a house of 
prostitution. Tracy posted bail to delay serving that sentence while appealing.

THE FOLLOWING ARE COMMENTS MADE BY SHERIFF JOHN DUFFY AND OTHERS REGARDING 
DUFFY'S DECISION NOT TO RUN FOR A SIXTH TERM: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I believe very strongly that I could defeat any and all of the jackals who 
haven't the courage to kill their own prey but rely upon others to provide them 
something to feed upon. . . . They (the media) don't like me because I fulfill 
the office of the sheriff the way the (county) charter says. I don't court them 
and I simply don't kiss their butts." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sheriff John Duffy 
</P>
<P>
"He will be remembered basically as a bully, as someone who was in office too 
long and misused his position. He will be remembered as the J. Edgar Hoover of 
San Diego law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Aguirre, a San Diego lawyer 
</P>
<P>
"If I called him a hundred times a year with law enforcement questions, I'd get 
100 answers before we hung up. Many others call you back. Many others never 
call you back. But Duffy would give you the answer, if it was within his 
reach." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Duffy supporter William Cowling 
</P>
<P>
"Some (deputies) would follow him into the ocean. Others don't care for him at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Skip Murphy, president, Deputy Sheriffs Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, Duffy's a good cop. But he's not that good of an administrator. 
That's come out many, many times." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Supervisor George Bailey 
</P>
<P>
"I'm encouraged by the fact that the man I've worked for for going on 21 years 
has that kind of confidence in me. Certainly, I'm not going to shun his 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown 
</P>
<P>
"Does this guy want to win?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Political consultant David Lewis, reacting to news that Drown said he 
welcomes Duffy's endorsement.

YEAR-ROUND PLAN DELAYED FOR SCHOOL IN VALENCIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bowing to pressure from angry parents, the Newhall School Board voted Monday 
night to delay for at least two years the start of year-round schooling at one 
elementary school in the fast-growing district. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees originally voted May 8 to start year-round schooling at Meadows 
Elementary School in Valencia in June, 1990. At the time, district officials 
said other schools would be switched to a year-round schedule as necessary to 
accommodate growing enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday night the trustees voted 3 to 2 to delay the change at least until 
July, 1992, to study other ways to cope with added enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 parents attended the meeting. Several speakers said year-round 
schedules would disrupt children's friendships and make family vacations 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Under year-round scheduling, traditional summer vacations are eliminated and 
vacation periods occur throughout the year. Students often are divided into 
three or four "tracks" that attend class on a rotating basis, with one group on 
vacation while the others are in school. 
</P>
<P>
Several parents said the school district did not adequately inform parents 
about the impact of year-round schools or the process by which the year-round 
plan was developed. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents very strongly feel they were not involved in the process," said Brian 
Drygas of Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
School Supt. Mike McGrath said the decision to delay year-round schooling in 
the district will hurt its chance of obtaining construction funds from the 
state for new schools. School districts using year-round schedules are given a 
high priority in financing formulas used by state officials to dole out 
construction funds. Only districts with schools damaged in fires, earthquakes 
or other disasters receive a higher priority, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
The district has 31 temporary classrooms -- structures similar to large 
trailers -- on its six campuses. Without year-round schedules, the district 
will have to install 16 more, McGrath said. He added that many parents also 
complain about the temporary classrooms.

RHODES SCHOLARS CHOSEN FROM 3 CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three young women from Pomona College, Stanford and USC are among 32 Americans 
chosen as Rhodes Scholars, entitling them to two years of study at Oxford 
University in England. 
</P>
<P>
The list of successful candidates, named from among 102 finalists in nationwide 
competition and announced over the weekend by Rhodes official David Alexander, 
president of Pomona College, also includes two California residents studying at 
Eastern universities. 
</P>
<P>
The winners included: 
</P>
<P>
* Martina Vandenberg, a 21-year-old senior who majors in international 
relations at Pomona College in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
The Gilroy, Calif., resident is president of the student body and participates 
in social causes, including Students for Nuclear Responsibility. She spent the 
summer of 1988 in Leningrad studying the Russian language. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the best way to describe my reaction is absolutely stunned, she said. 
"I can't wait to meet the other 31 people." 
</P>
<P>
She plans to undertake Soviet studies at Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
* S. Kim Grose, 21, a Stanford University senior, who is studying cultural 
anthropology and is the skipper of Stanford's varsity sailing team. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Washington, D.C., and reared in New York City, she plans to return to 
California after completing her Oxford studies in human sciences. She hopes to 
undertake grass-roots community service, such as working with Central American 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Being chosen as a Rhodes Scholar seems "like a dream," Grose said. "I'm just in 
shock. . . . It just hasn't become real to me." 
</P>
<P>
* Tara M. Silvestri, 22, a Latin and Greek major at USC, where she is a member 
of Phi Beta Kappa and Mortar Board, the national leadership and service 
honorary society. 
</P>
<P>
Silvestri, a senior with a 4.0 grade average, has been recognized at USC for 
her volunteer activities in working with the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Las Vegas, Silvestri said she is "very excited" about prospects of 
studying the classics at Oxford. After her return home, she expects to study 
for her doctorate and then teach at the university level. She is the seventh 
USC student to be named a Rhodes Scholar. 
</P>
<P>
* Amy Deanne Matthews, a senior English major at Mt. Holyoke College in South 
Hadley, Mass. Matthews, an Escondido resident, has a perfect academic record, 
plays varsity basketball and rows for the varsity crew. She tutors Cambodian 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews already has studied at Somerville College of Oxford and rowed for the 
college's crew. She is the first Rhodes Scholar to be elected from Mt. Holyoke 
since women became eligible for the scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
* Reza K. Gandjei, 23, who comes from Palo Alto and attends Harvard Medical 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Gandjei, a 1987 graduate of UC Berkeley with a degree in molecular and cellular 
biology, was born in Iran and immigrated to England with his parents, where he 
lived for 12 years before coming to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At Oxford, Gandjei said he plans to pursue a course in philosophy, politics and 
economics aimed at broadening his knowledge of medicine and health care policy 
and medical ethics.

COMMUNITY IN NEWHALL GETS ROAD NOBODY WANTS TO USE 
</P>

<P>
It's Santa Clarita's newest road. And with any luck, its builders say, it will 
never be used. 
</P>
<P>
The gated, mile-long road was built to give a secluded Newhall neighborhood an 
emergency escape route in case of fire, earthquake or other disaster. The 
neighborhood, known as the Circle J development, is accessible only by Circle J 
Ranch Road, which crosses railroad tracks that parallel San Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have complained for years that the community of 500 households could 
be cut off from firefighters or police if a train stalls or derails, blocking 
the road. The two-lane emergency road connects Circle J Ranch Road with 12th 
Street, which crosses the railroad tracks a mile to the south. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, officials from Santa Clarita and Watt America, the Circle J 
developer, announced that the road was ready for use. Richard S. Urso, 
president of Watt America, said it will cost his company about $1 million to 
build the road and provide security guards for a three-year period. A guard 
will watch the gate 24 hours a day, a condition imposed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
The guards will open the gate during emergencies or when a train blocks Circle 
J Ranch Road for more than 20 minutes, he said. Urso said he hopes the guards 
never have to unlock the gate. 
</P>
<P>
The city required the road to remain closed except in emergencies. It is 
unsuitable for everyday use because it crosses a dry riverbed and is not 
lighted, Medina said. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency road will no longer be necessary once the city builds a bridge to 
span the railroad tracks, linking Circle J Ranch Road with Wiley Canyon Road 
across the Santa Clara River, Medina said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wiley Canyon Bridge, however, will not be built for several years, Medina 
said. Watt America is contributing $4.5 million of the $9-million to 
$10-million cost of the bridge, he said.

ACTIVISTS PROTEST CANOGA PARK FIRM'S USE OF RAIN FOREST WOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN YAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
About two dozen environmental activists, many smeared with mud or wearing 
masks, demonstrated Monday at the Canoga Park branch of the nation's 
third-largest wood- products company to protest imports they say are depleting 
the world's rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, most of them members of LA Earth First, held 10-foot banners 
across the entrance to Georgia-Pacific Corp., 7891 Deering Ave., during most of 
the hourlong demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Pendergast of the Rainforest Action Network said activists are starting 
to focus on lumber companies around the country that import materials from rain 
forests, hoping the public will boycott their products. Georgia-Pacific's 
retail and wholesale outlet in Canoga Park is the only business targeted in the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have predicted that the destruction of rain forests will create a 
disastrous global warming trend and lead to the extinction of many plants and 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia-Pacific employees said the protest was misguided. Sheila Weidman, 
manager of corporate communications in Atlanta, said the company uses rain 
forest lumber only as backing for plywood and attributes much of the decline of 
rain forests to agricultural programs. 
</P>
<P>
She did not have figures available showing how much lumber the company imports 
from rain forests but said countries that are involved plant trees to replace 
those harvested. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's demonstration, a handful of protesters wore colorful monster masks 
signifying the "demon killers" of trees, while others were plastered with mud 
to signify "oneness" with the earth. 
</P>
<P>
The only tense moment occurred when protesters tried to stop a truck from 
entering the property. About eight demonstrators tried to push the truck 
backward as it inched into the company lot. 
</P>
<P>
As a demonstrator yelled "tree and people killers," the truck driver, who 
worked for another company, got out of the cab and pushed a man who had climbed 
up and opened the passenger door. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, an employee who was upset about being called a pig angrily 
invited a protester to fight. "What about the unborn babies?" yelled forklift 
driver Mike Cormier, one of several Georgia-Pacific employees who said it was 
more important to fight human abortions than to save trees.

EX-BUILDING INSPECTOR PLEADS NO CONTEST IN BRIBERY, TAX CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A former Los Angeles building and safety inspector pleaded no contest Monday in 
a case in which he was charged with bribery, tax evasion and grand theft for 
accepting at least $22,500 in kickbacks from a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Dellon, 49, of Sun Valley entered the no-contest plea before Judge David 
M. Horwitz in Los Angeles Municipal Court to one charge of bribery and one 
charge of tax evasion. Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Freeman said Dellon 
also agreed to pay as much as $20,000 in restitution in exchange for dropping 
the grand-theft charge and an estimated $5,000 in back taxes and penalties on 
income from the bribes. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said Dellon also faces a maximum of five years imprisonment. He is to 
be sentenced on the two charges Feb. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Dellon was assigned to the city's Fire Safety Unit from Aug. 11, 1986, until he 
resigned last February after he was threatened with discharge, city records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the district attorney's office filed nine felony counts of bribery, 
one count of grand theft and one count of filing a false income tax return 
against Dellon. The other charges were dropped as part of the plea bargain 
agreed to Monday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Freeman, Dellon would tell the owners of buildings he inspected 
that the buildings needed seismic work, and he would refer them to a 
contracting firm owned by Hermogenes Icasiano of Los Angeles. Freeman said the 
owners of the buildings were led to believe that they would get better 
treatment if they hired Icasiano's firm to do the repair work. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Dellon received a 10% cut of the fees that Icasiano charged for 
the work. Icasiano said he paid Dellon $22,500 between August, 1987, and March, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said Dellon also would be required to make restitution to a woman who 
paid him as much as $20,000 for drawing building plans that were never 
finished. The grand-theft charge resulting from that incident was dropped in 
return for repayment of the money he received, Freeman said.

MAN DIES FROM FUMES OF BARBECUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 24-year-old man died of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning after inhaling 
fumes from a barbecue brought inside a Van Nuys apartment after a birthday 
dinner, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified as Hugo Fontela of Los Angeles, said Bob Dambacher, 
spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Fontela was found dead about 7 p.m. Sunday in a bedroom of the apartment in the 
14000 block of Delano Street, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Alfonso Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Fontela had been celebrating the birthday of a friend, Teodorico Torres, 28, 
the night before with a barbecue chicken dinner on the patio of Torres' 
apartment, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres and his roommate, Guadalupe Rodriguez, 28, brought the barbecue inside 
about 11 p.m. and left it in the kitchen, Sgt. Rodriguez said. Torres told 
police he checked and thought the coals were extinguished when the three men 
went to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
When Rodriguez and Torres awoke Sunday evening, they found Fontela dead, 
Rodriguez said. An autopsy is scheduled for later this week to determine the 
cause of death. A pet bird also was found dead in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics took Torres and Rodriguez, who were both feeling ill, to Valley 
Presbyterian Hospital, where they were treated and released, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Burning charcoal releases carbon monoxide -- a colorless, odorless gas -- said 
Dr. Marc Bayer of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn.'s Poison Center. Because 
of these qualities, Bayer said, "you would not even know you are being poisoned 
until it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
Bayer said the gas causes blood cells to stop carrying oxygen to tissues, which 
can result in brain damage or internal suffocation and death.

HIGH WINDS CAUSE TROUBLE IN EAST COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dry, gusting Santa Ana winds played havoc with motor homes and large trucks 
Monday in the eastern San Diego County mountains but created few problems in 
coastal areas despite earlier predictions. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol closed Interstate 8 to large vehicles for a 
50-mile stretch between East Willows Road near Alpine and Ocotillo on the 
desert floor in Imperial Valley. Wind gusts up to 60 m.p.h. were reported both 
in Pine Valley and further east at the 4,190-foot Crestwood Summit, the highest 
point on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
Tractor-trailer rigs and other large vehicles will not be allowed through the 
area until the winds subside, which National Weather Service forecasters said 
will be today. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist Wilbur Shigehara said Monday that a fairly strong high-pressure 
system over central Idaho was generating a dry stream of winds blowing toward 
Southern California, but with selective effects in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The winds are not widespread, but are being found in some of the natural 
coastal river canyons, such as Sweetwater or Rancho Penasquitos, and further 
east in the county, but not along the coast," Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a weak, low pressure right off the coast," Shigehara said, minimizing 
the air-pressure difference along the coast, so that not all the winds are 
reaching the sea. 
</P>
<P>
But Shigehara said stronger winds will blow into coastal canyons during the 
night and morning today, before dissipating by mid-week as the high-pressure 
system slowly moves east. 
</P>
<P>
"We are under the influence of a Santa Ana. We had very low humidity Monday, 
20% at 4 p.m. and even lower -- 15% -- at noontime," he said. "These conditions 
will continue all week, with sunshine and low humidity, with winds picking up 
perhaps late in the week again, and no rain as far as Tuesday." At this point, 
it appears likely that San Diego will receive all 600 minutes of sunshine 
available Dec. 21, the winter solstice, with the shortest daylight of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fog that plagued drivers and air travelers this weekend during 
the late-night and early-morning hours will remain offshore, Shigehara said. 
Colder night temperatures will be the price residents pay for 
warmer-than-normal daytime readings. 
</P>
<P>
"We have frost advisories for agricultural areas this week, and it will get 
down to 27 degrees or so in some wind-protected areas such as Bonsall," 
Shigehara said. "Pauma Valley, Escondido, Rincon will have some light frosts, 
and it could drop into the mid-20s by the end of the week as colder air from 
the Rockies spills west." 
</P>
<P>
The dry weather means red-flag fire conditions throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
A fire in Sycamore Canyon near Poway broke out early Monday afternoon after a 
private contractor ran into problems while working on a power line, San Diego 
fire officials said. About 100 firefighters brought the fire under control 
after it burned 35 acres.

3 ORDERED TO TRIAL IN RACIAL ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three young men believed to be members of a skinhead group were ordered Monday 
to stand trial on charges of assaulting another young man they mistakenly 
believed was Latino. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, 18-year-old Eric Vaerga, identified the three in San Diego 
Municipal Court as the ones who attacked him Oct. 21 at 2 a.m. in the Mission 
Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Kuntz, 20; Michael Mann, 19; and Michael DiPaolo, 21, were ordered to 
appear in Superior Court on Dec. 27, for arraignment and setting of a trial 
date. 
</P>
<P>
They also are charged with depriving Vaerga of his civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
A charge of mayhem was dismissed in the preliminary hearing conducted by Judge 
Nicholas Kasimatis. 
</P>
<P>
Vaerga is from an island in the Pacific Ocean and looks Hispanic, said the 
prosecutor, Luis Aragon. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants' steel-toed boots were admitted as evidence in the hearing, and 
Vaerga said the men kicked him with them. The defendants reportedly yelled 
white-supremacy slogans during the incident. Kuntz has posted $50,000 bond and 
remains free, but Mann and DiPaolo remain in County Jail in lieu of $50,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
In another unrelated incident involving another alleged skinhead, Christopher 
Leon, 19, was ordered Monday to undergo a 90-day diagnostic study at Chino 
State Prison before sentencing March 12. 
</P>
<P>
Leon pleaded no contest in September to assaulting a black man accompanying a 
white woman to her car in University Heights on April 4. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith, 44, suffered broken ribs, spinal and back injuries, a broken 
nose, and an eye injury requiring surgery. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez will study prison officials' 
recommendations before sentencing Leon.

ROYALS SIGN MARK DAVIS TO $13-MILLION CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a package of Kansas City Chamber of Commerce pamphlets, 
real-estate brochures and media guides arrived at Mark Davis' home in 
Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Davis opened the package, knowing that the Kansas City Royals were one of the 
teams bidding for free-agent players, but instead of studying -- or even 
reading the material -- he tossed it aside. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I was going to stay in San Diego anyway," Davis said, "so why did I 
need that stuff for?" 
</P>
<P>
Guess who has been studying demographic statistics in the greater Kansas City 
area these past 24 hours? 
</P>
<P>
On Monday at Royals Stadium, Davis signed a contract for the largest annual 
salary in baseball history, $13 million for four years with Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he's still disillusioned because he isn't staying in San Diego, but the 
Royals are considered one of the powers of the American League. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember picking up the Phoenix paper one morning and seeing the Padres 
weren't interested, and then a couple of paragraphs later saying the Kansas 
City Royals weren't interested," said Candy Davis, Davis' wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Mark, 'Well, this is great. It looks like we're going to end up playing 
in Japan.' 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to overreact at things like that." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres might have overreacted when Davis' agents, Randy and Alan Hendricks, 
rejected their four-year, $12 million contract last Tuesday. They found a 
replacement, free agent Craig Lefferts of the San Francisco Giants, who saved 
20 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals, who had listed Davis as their No. 1 off-season priority, also 
announced that they had dropped out of the Davis sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out that they rejected the Padres' offer and weren't going to 
sign with anyone unless they got a five-year guaranteed offer," Royal General 
Manager John Schuerholz said, "I said, 'Well, we're out of it, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
So the Royals spent $6 million on starter Storm Davis, another $2 million 
re-signing free-agent second baseman Frank White and center fielder Willie 
Wilson, and started making their spring-training plans when the phone rang 
Friday morning in Schuerholz's office. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Hendricks asked if the Royals were still interested in Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at that price," Schuerholz said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks: "How about for less years and less money." 
</P>
<P>
Schuerholz: "I'm listening." 
</P>
<P>
The Hendricks brothers, who are from Kansas City, and Schuerholz opened serious 
negotiations and at 6 p.m. Sunday, Davis was told to pack his bags. He was 
going to Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
By afternoon, he was wearing a Royals cap. 
</P>
<P>
He also had his signature on the richest contract per season in baseball 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Davis will receive a $1.5 million signing bonus, $1.75 million salary in 1990 
and $3.25 million in 1991, 1992 and 1993. He also has award incentives in his 
contract that could pay him another $550,000 a season: $100,000 for the Cy 
Young award, $100,000 for the Rolaids Award, $100,000 for the American League 
Most Valuable Player award, $100,000 for World Series MVP award, $50,000 for 
MVP of the playoffs, $50,000 for the All-Star team, $25,000 for the Gold Glove 
award and $25,000 for making the postseason All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is amazing the kind of money that's coming out now, isn't it?" said 
Candy Davis, laughing. "You think he discovered the cure for cancer, or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
It is a lot of money, but Davis accepted only the fifth-best offer. He was 
offered five-year guaranteed contracts for more money per season by the New 
York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies. And there were four-year offers from 
the Angels, Detroit Tigers, Atlanta Braves, and, of course, the Padres, for 
whom he saved 44 games last season while winning the Cy Young award. 
</P>
<P>
"These were spirited negotiations," Randy Hendricks said, "but let the record 
show that San Diego was the one that didn't want to sign Mark, not the other 
way around." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres made their fourth and final offer to Davis on Friday night for $12 
million over four years. They waited for a response, and when Randy Hendricks 
said last Tuesday that they were rejecting the offer, Padre owner Joan Kroc 
became incensed, and told Manager Jack McKeon to find another reliever. 
</P>
<P>
"The night the Padres offered four years for $12 million," Hendricks said, "we 
asked for four years at $14 million. So it's inaccurate to say we never made a 
four-year offer to the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, we weren't surprised when they went out and signed Lefferts, but we 
were surprised they never came to us and said, 'This is our final offer. This 
is it. If you don't take it, we're going to make other arrangements.' 
</P>
<P>
"We never were told that, or else Mark might be wearing a Padre uniform today. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish the Padres the very best, and I hope Craig Lefferts does the job for 
them (next) year, but I think everyone knows that San Diego is where Mark 
wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
Said Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn: "There's a lot of us that don't feel real 
good right now. Deep in my mind, I was hoping everything would turn out all 
right, and he's sign with us. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to miss him very much because there's nobody like him. You just 
don't find that kind of reliever with that kind of stuff, and you certainly 
don't see those overpowering relievers in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be just as successful over there as he was here. You'll see. He'll be in 
the All-Star game for the next four years." 
</P>
<P>
Davis becomes the first big free-agent signing in the Royals' 20-year history. 
They've gone after Catfish Hunter, Pete Rose, Tommy John and Rick Sutcliffe, 
but always wound up just hiking the bidding for someone else. 
</P>
<P>
This time, after four years of not attempting to lure high-priced free agents, 
they got the man that they believe will bring another World Series title to 
America's heartland. 
</P>
<P>
"We won a lot of division titles and a few championships with Dan Quisenberry 
as our stopper," Schuerholz said, "and we came to the realization that we had 
to have someone in that role to return to championship caliber. We had to make 
some moves. With the A's and Angels in our division, we couldn't afford to mark 
time."

also announced that they had dropped out of the Davis sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found out that they rejected the Padres' offer and weren't going to 
sign with anyone unless they got a five-year guaranteed offer," Royal General 
Manager John Schuerholz said, "I said, 'Well, we're out of it, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
So the Royals went out and spent $6 million on starter Storm Davis, spent 
another $2 million re-signing free-agent second baseman Frank White and center 
fielder Willie Wilson, and started making their spring-training plans when the 
phone rang Friday morning in Schuerholz's office. 
</P>
<P>
It was Randy Hendricks, asking if the Royals were still interested in Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at that price," Schuerholz said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks: "How about for less years and less money." 
</P>
<P>
Schuerholz: "I'm listening." 
</P>
<P>
The Hendricks' brothers, who just so happen to be from Kansas City, and 
Schuerholz opened serious negotiations and at 6 p.m. Sunday, Davis was told to 
pack his bags. He was going to Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Davis took a flight to Kansas City on Monday morning, and by the afternoon, was 
wearing a Royals cap. 
</P>
<P>
He also had his signature on the richest contract per season in the history of 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Davis will receive a $1.5 million signing bonus, $1.75 million in 1990 and 
$3.25 million in 1991, 1992, and 1993. He also has award incentives in his 
contract that could pay him another $550,000 a season: $100,000 for the Cy 
Young award, $100,000 for the Rolaids Award; $100,000 for the American League 
Most Valuable Player award; $100,000 for World Series MVP award; $50,000 for 
MVP of the Playoffs; $50,000 for the all-star team; $25,000 for the Gold Glove 
award; and $25,000 for making the post-season all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is amazing the kind of money that's coming out now, isn't it," said 
Candy Davis, laughing. "You'd think he discovered the cure for cancer, or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
It indeed is a lot of money, but then again, Davis accepted only the fifth-best 
offer. He was offered five-year guaranteed contracts for more money per season 
by the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies. And there were four-year 
offers from the Angels, Detroit Tigers, Atlanta Braves, and, of course, the 
Padres, for whom he just so happened to save 44 games last season while winning 
the Cy Young award. 
</P>
<P>
"These were spirited negotiations," Randy Hendricks said, "but let the record 
show that San Diego were the ones who didn't want to sign Mark, not the other 
way around." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres made their fourth and final offer to Davis on Friday night for $12 
million over four years. They waited for a response, and when Randy Hendricks 
said Tuesday that they were rejecting the offer, Padre owner Joan Kroc became 
incensed, and told Manager Jack McKeon to find another reliever. 
</P>
<P>
"The night the Padres offered four years for $12 million," Hendricks said, "we 
asked for four years at $14 million. So it's inaccurate to say we never made a 
four-year offer to the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, we weren't surprised when they went out and signed Lefferts, but we 
were surprised they never came to us and said, 'This is our final offer. This 
is it. If you don't take it, we're going to make other arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
"We never were told that, or else Mark might be wearing a Padre uniform today. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish the Padres the very best, and I hope Craig Lefferts does the job for 
them this year, but I think everyone knows that San Diego is where Mark wanted 
to play." 
</P>
<P>
Said Padre right fielder Tony Gwynn: "There's a lot of us that don't feel real 
good right now. Deep in my mind, I was hoping everything would turn out all 
right, and he'd sign with us. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to miss him very much because there's nobody like him. You just 
don't find that kind of reliever with that kind of stuff, and you certainly 
don't see those overpowering relievers in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be just as successful over there as he was here. You'll see. He'll be in 
the All-Star Game for the next four years." 
</P>
<P>
Davis becomes the first big free-agent signing in the Royals' 20-year history. 
They've gone after the big stars such as Catfish Hunter, Pete Rose, Tommy John 
and Rick Sutcliffe, but always wound up just hiking the bidding for someone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
This time, after a four-year hiatus of not attempting to lure high-priced free 
agents, they got the man who they believe will bring another World Series title 
to America's heartland. 
</P>
<P>
"We won a lot of division titles and a few championships with Dan Quisenberry 
as our stopper," Schuerholz said, "and we came to the realization that we had 
to have someone in that role to return to championship caliber. We had to make 
some moves. With the A's and Angels in our division, we couldn't afford to mark 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"This has become the age of acquisitions in baseball, not scouting and 
development. And I think we just got the biggest acquisition." 
</P>
<P>
The availability of Davis in the first place already has cost Tony Siegle his 
job as Padre vice president/personnel, and President Dick Freeman's status also 
is shaky. Freeman had the opportunity to sign Davis to a two-year extension for 
$2.8 million this spring and Davis admitted he would have settled for $2.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman refused, and eight months later, the decision has developed into one of 
the biggest blunders in Padre history. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe the fans in San Diego would be real happy right now," 
Hendricks said. "There's a certain amount of regret on the part of Mark, but 
what was a disappointment, has become a feeling of euphoria." 
</P>
<P>
Said Davis: "I'm very excited to be here, and I'm not just saying that. And 
it's just not because of the money. It's a great organization with a great 
commitment to win. 
</P>
<P>
"The organization was high on my list right from the beginning. When I talked 
to the Royals, and they were in position trying to woo me, they talked about 
family and family-type situations instead of money. That's what really 
impressed me." 
</P>
<P>
Candy Davis, however, had other reasons to believe why her husband chose the 
Royals: 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mark thinks the best part to all this is, is that now he gets to rub 
elbows with Bo Jackson."

MONTANA GIVETH, TAKETH AWAY; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: SAN FRANCISCO QUARTERBACK GETS 458 PASSING YARDS AS 49ERS COME BACK FROM 
17 POINTS BEHIND IN FINAL QUARTER TO WIN, 30-27. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams, the one team you would expect to know better, did everything for Joe 
Montana but set out the silverware and napkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Come in, Mr. Montana, have a seat. There's the cutlery. Carve us to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 And Montana did. The Rams have seen his Super Bowl rings, watched his 
highlight reel, admired his comebacks and contributed to his legend. 
</P>
<P>
They do know better, but, still, it didn't matter. The Rams had a 17-point lead 
with less than a quarter remaining. A playoff berth was at hand, the division 
title in clearer focus. The curse of Montana at Anaheim Stadium was over. 
</P>
<P>
Then they gave Joe Montana two chances. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry. Next, please. 
</P>
<P>
And with that, the San Francisco 49ers rallied to defeat the Rams, 30-27, 
before a record-crowd of 67,959 at Anaheim Stadium. The 49ers clinched their 
seventh division title of the decade. San Francisco assured itself the 
home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. The Rams are second-best, again. 
</P>
<P>
Montana was so businesslike he might have worked the final minutes in a 
double-breasted suit. Quietly, he sliced the Rams' lead to 27-17 with a 
seven-yard scoring pass to Mike Wilson with 10:04 left. Then he took his place 
on the sideline and waited to pounce. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were going to keep the ball out of his hands if it killed them. They 
mounted a skillful drive after the touchdown, consuming yards and time. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett stood over center on second-and-goal at the 49ers' 
four. He could smell the clinching touchdown. Then, a center snap stuck in the 
mud. 
</P>
<P>
"He never touched it," center Doug Smith said later. "I should have pulled it 
up. I didn't. It was my play to make and I didn't make it." 
</P>
<P>
Matt Millen, the former Raider linebacker who had agreed to sign with the Rams 
earlier this year until the 49ers jumped in with more money, recovered at the 
five. 
</P>
<P>
Montana raised a brow. He had already found receiver John Taylor on a 92-yard 
scoring reception in the second quarter, and now seemed like a good time for a 
replay. 
</P>
<P>
Boom. One play. Montana hit Taylor over the middle, and he broke loose for a 
95-yard touchdown with 6:27 to go. Mike Cofer missed the extra point, leaving 
the score 27-23. 
</P>
<P>
Then, another gift. Ron Brown, who nearly cost the Rams a victory last week in 
Dallas when he fumbled a kickoff, did it again. Steve Hendrickson made the hit, 
and Keith Henderson recovered at the Ram 27. And Montana had 6:15 left to work 
with. It was almost too easy. 
</P>
<P>
He worked the clock down some, then hit Taylor for 15 yards to the seven. On 
third-and-goal from the one, tailback Roger Craig scored the winning touchdown 
with 3:42 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams still had an opening. Everett had led five fourth-quarter comebacks 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
There wouldn't be a sixth. 
</P>
<P>
On third and nine at his own 21, Everett was sacked by defensive end Pierce 
Holt, who said he was expecting a draw play and was stunting on the line with 
teammate Kevin Fagan. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran outside and the guy (Everett) ran right into me," Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
End of game. 
</P>
<P>
Montana and Taylor have never been better. Both set single-game career marks. 
Montana, 8-0 against the Rams as a starter in Anaheim, completed 30 of 42 
passes for 458 yards and three touchdowns. Taylor finished with 286 yards on 11 
catches. Jerry Rice (five catches, 38 yards) was left to play decoy. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson refused to acknowledge that the Rams gave the game away. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who thought that the game was in hand was a fool," he said. "Anyone who 
says we blew it doesn't understand the football team we played." 
</P>
<P>
Or the football player, Montana. 
</P>
<P>
The football game wasn't bad, either. The last 3:22 of the first half alone was 
worth the price of admission. In that span, the Rams came within four yards of 
taking a 24-3 lead, then one penalty in a series of freakish last-minute plays 
from having the score tied at 17. 
</P>
<P>
It started with the Rams, who had fourth and goal on the 49ers' four. Field 
goal, right? Take the 20-10 lead and run. Wrong. If you've got something up 
your sleeve, use it against the arch rivals. At least that's what the Rams 
figured. 
</P>
<P>
They faked a 21-yard field goal attempt, as holder Pete Holohan kept the ball 
and swept right. Holohan tried to leap over Tim McKyer but was squashed by 
Michael Walter at the one. 
</P>
<P>
As a turned out, those three points, had Lansford converted, were the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great call," Robinson said of the failed fake. "I thought it was when 
I called it and I still do. I thought a touchdown at that point would break 
their backs. Anyone who would second-guess that call is simply looking at it 
after the game is over. I thought it was a great call." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, so did the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers took over there, and got some breathing room on a seven-yard pass 
from Montana to Brent Jones. On third and three from the eight, Montana found 
Taylor wide open on the left after cornerback Cliff Hicks slipped at the line 
of scrimmage. The foot race was on to the end zone, with Taylor weaving through 
Ram defenders, first losing Anthony Newman, then Jerry Gray, on his way to a 
92-yard touchdown with 2:27 left, cutting the Ram lead to 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
One Rams' strategy backfired, and there was more noise to come. After their own 
drive fizzled, the Rams punted, handing Montana the ball at his own 37 with 
1:24 remaining -- an eternity for a comeback king. Before you blinked, Montana 
had first and goal at the Rams' five with 17 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Then, mayhem. Kevin Greene sacked Montana for a 12-yard loss to the 17 on 
second down. Ten seconds left. Terry Tausch jumped off-sides, pushing the 49ers 
back to the 22. Still, Montana had another crack at the end zone and found it, 
hitting Craig for an apparent touchdown pass. But tackle Steve Wallace was 
called for holding, pushing the 49ers to third-and-goal at the 32 with four 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Now there's only time for a field goal attempt. Cofer hits from 49-yards out. 
False start by the 49er line. The Rams run from the field, thinking the half's 
over. It's not. The penalty was called before the snap, so the 49ers get the 
four seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's third-and-goal at the 37. Cofer tries again from 54, but his attempt 
hits the left upright as time expires. The Rams kiss their 20-10 lead. Just 
your ordinary first half. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it was anything but. The Rams had a 17-0 lead while Montana had run 
only seven offensive plays. Nice game plan if you can get it. 
</P>
<P>
Everett set the tone on the game's first play, hitting Anderson on a 34-pass 
play to the 49er 41 over corner Darryl Pollard. Seven plays later, Bell scored 
on a three-yard run to make it 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
On the Rams' next possession, Everett worked Anderson against Pollard again, 
drawing a 42-yard pass interference penalty to the 49er 21. Everett moved it in 
from there, hitting Damone Johnson on a four-yard scoring pass to make it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams had a chance for an early knockout when cornerback/fight promoter 
LeRoy Irvin intercepted a Montana pass intended for Rice, returning it 18 yards 
to the 11. But the Rams could move only three yards on three plays and had to 
settle for a 25-yard Lansford field goal with 2:56 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Robinson didn't talk about the one that got away. He insisted the 
49ers haven't seen the last of his team. "I told our team we're going to win 
four in a row and get a rematch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Receiver John Taylor broke the 49ers' single-game yardage record with his 286 
yards. Jerry Rice had 240 yards in 11 catches against the Rams in 1985. Joe 
Montana's previous high for passing yardage was 441 yards. . . Jim Everett's 
final numbers: 18 of 31 passes for 239 yards and two touchdowns.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: SECTION BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS NEED A HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

After discovering that the San Diego Sports Arena was unavailable for the 
section basketball championships, commissioner Kendall Webb was notified Monday 
that San Diego State's Peterson Gym also is not available. Golden Hall now is 
the next facility on Webb's list of possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
A men's volleyball match and two women's basketball games are scheduled 
February 28 and March 1-3 at Peterson Gym, the dates Webb requested. The Sports 
Arena is unavailable March 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
The only site large enough to accommodate all the championship games is Golden 
Hall, which seats 4,100. Webb said that if a large enough facility can't be 
found, the games will be held at individual high schools. 
</P>
<P>
There are three factors hinging on whether the championships could be played at 
Golden Hall, said Frank Mlyniec, Golden Hall's Booking and Events Coordinator. 
There is a tentative hold on the hall for March 1-3 by another organization, 
which must first be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
The other two factors Mlyniec said must be worked out between Webb and U.S. 
International University, which plays its home games at Golden Hall. USIU's 
final home game is scheduled for March 3 and the floor that is put down for 
games belongs to the school. 
</P>
<P>
"If the three factors aren't positive, it can't happen," Mlyniec said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Arena has been the site of the championships for the past 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
A change in the playoff location isn't the only switch for county basketball 
teams. After two years of implementing an open format for playoffs, allowing 
every team a spot, the section is reverting to a 16-team format. 
</P>
<P>
There are only seven schools in Divisions III and IV and 15 in Division V by 
enrollment numbers enabling all the teams to earn a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Divisions I and II, however, have 17 and 26 schools respectively so for a 
possible playoff opportunity some schools have petitioned to switch divisions. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' division, Sweetwater, Vista, Castle Park and Point Loma will move 
up to Division I, increasing that division to 21 teams and dropping Division II 
to 22 teams. Vista's and Santana's girls' teams will switch from Division II to 
Division I. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Clark is having no problem adjusting to playing for Christian High School 
after transfering from Valhalla this year. Friday, against Mountain Empire, 
Clark scored 58 points surpassing his game high of 55 he scored last year when 
Valhalla played Santana. 
</P>
<P>
Clark is now in the section record book for third and fourth most points scored 
in a game. The No. 1 spot is held by Madison's Mitchell Lilly who scored 61 
points against San Diego in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Clark averaged 30.3 points per game and is second in the record books 
for best scoring average in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara (Oxnard) will be playing at Valhalla Saturday and at USDHS on 
December 18. Santa Clara, the defending Division IV state champion, is led by 
6-5 senior guard Shon Tarver. Tarver has been recruited by Arizona, Syracuse, 
UNLV and UCLA.

SALUD, MEDINA ON HIGH AFTER LOW EVENING;

<P>
BOXING: BOTH FIGHTERS WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS WHEN OPPONENTS ARE DISQUALIFIED FOR 
ILLEGAL BLOWS.

What are the chances of two championship bouts being decided by low blows the 
same night? 
</P>
<P>
It happened on a wild and crazy Monday at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Jesus Salud was awarded the World Boxing Assn. junior-featherweight 
title when referee Larry Rozadilla disqualified Juan Jose Estrada in the ninth 
round. 
</P>
<P>
Less than an hour earlier, the 6,166 fans saw Manuel Medina win the heretofore 
vacant WBA Intercontinental junior-lightweight title over Edgar Castro in the 
seventh round. 
</P>
<P>
The main event was called after a left to the groin felled Salud. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada had points deducted in both the sixth and seventh rounds for low blows 
and landed a few more in the eighth that went undetected. 
</P>
<P>
"Salud was hurt badly," said Rozadilla. "He had said he wouldn't go on after a 
couple of the other low punches. I told him he would lose if he didn't. But 
this time I knew he couldn't continue." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the fight was decided near the bell ending the second round when 
Estrada, the 122-pound champion from Tijuana, was rocked by a left hook. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada wobbled to his corner and never recovered fully. He was well behind on 
all scorecards after being knocked down by a left-right combination in the 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada won only at the pay window, collecting $50,000 to $15,000 for Salud, 
who began his career in Honolulu and now lives in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Burton Gilliam disqualified Castro when he tagged Medina with his 
fourth illegal punch. 
</P>
<P>
Medina, 18, who didn't begin his pro career in Tijuana until he was 13, had 
been floored by hooks below the belt in the second and third rounds. 
</P>
<P>
He also was felled by a left in the third, but he was quicker and more active 
than Castro and was ahead on two cards and even on the other. 
</P>
<P>
In other bouts, super-middleweight Vincent Durham won a five-round decision 
over Fred Thomas and lightweight Jaime Castillo won a four-round decision over 
Eddie Alvarado.

<P>
What may be a final bid to keep the Raiders in Los Angeles will be made this 
morning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Spectacor, the private firm that has a management contract with the Coliseum, 
is sending its heavyweights, Chairman Ed Snider and President Tony Taveras, to 
meet with Al Davis. They are expected to spell out in detail their plans to 
tear down the Coliseum and build a new one on the same site if the Commission 
will lease them the land. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Something attractive is going to be proposed to the Raiders," said Coliseum 
General Manager Joel Ralph. "Maybe more attractive than anything Oakland or 
Sacramento can come up with." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Similar meetings have been held with Clipper owner Donald Sterling about 
building a state-of-the-art arena in Exposition Park for the basketball team. . 
. . 
</P>

That was a nice touch, the Raiders introducing special teamers instead of the 
offense or defense before their final regular-season home game. And Vance 
Mueller was something special again, returning a kickoff to the Phoenix 
46-yard-line to set up the winning touchdown drive. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Why should a muff be treated any different from a fumble? The nullification of 
Raider defensive end Mike Wise's 64-yard return for a touchdown after he 
scooped up a loose ball Sunday was proper, but the rule is nonsensical. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders ought to dial Mike Dyal's number more often. Like his predecessor

ROOKIE QUARTERBACK TOLLIVER SHOWS FLASHES OF A CHARGER FUTURE

Aw shucks. 
</P>
<P>
Charger quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver didn't look too bad Sunday, did he? 
</P>
<P>
There's something very apple pie about this kid, a refreshing change from the 
always silent and sometimes sullen Jim McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
Punky is out. Spunky is in. 
</P>
<P>
Get this. Fresh off his third and best start in Sunday's, 26-21, loss to the 
Washington Redskins, the rookie Tolliver was saying: "This is a great stadium. 
I liked it, enjoyed it. I've been a Cowboy fan all my life so I hate (the 
Redskins) and would have loved to have won the game." 
</P>
<P>
Was that really Billy Joe or was that Beaver Cleaver? 
</P>
<P>
Up until Sunday, Tolliver had just three things working in his favor. 
Enthusiasm, enthusiasm and enthusiasm. And the rest of what everybody saw was 
just exactly what you would expect from a rookie. Incompletions and indecisions 
piled on top of interceptions and losses. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver made his first start Oct. 29 against Seattle. He completed six passes 
in 17 attempts for 41 yards and was excused after the third quarter in favor of 
McMahon. The Chargers lost, 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
Round two was Dec. 3. Tolliver started against the Jets and completed 24 of 51 
passes for 230 yards and two interceptions. Better, but still brutal. The 
Chargers lost, 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than canceling "The Tolliver Show," as he did after the Seattle game, 
Charger Coach Dan Henning stuck with his rookie for a second consecutive week. 
The result may have put "The McMahon Show," which is certainly no longer cost 
effective, in permanent reruns. Tolliver completed 24 of 39 for 350 yards and 
two touchdowns Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He got rid of the ball quickly. He avoided the rush. And, for the first time as 
a starter, he didn't throw an interception. Against a good defense, too. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there were moments when he looked like a rookie. In the final two 
minutes, Tolliver threw high to receiver Wayne Walker on fourth-and-three from 
the Redskins' six, allowing cornerback Martin Mayhew to strip the ball free and 
prevent the Chargers from a first and goal. But, for the first time in a long 
while, the big picture was bright. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver's progression from atrocious to acceptable wasn't completely 
unexpected by his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"None of what you saw today surprised any of us," said cornerback Gill Byrd 
when asked to assess Tolliver's performance against the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, too, Tolliver didn't roll over and go to sleep when the Chargers 
traded for McMahon. He said right from the beginning that he planned to make a 
run at the starting job. But what were the Chargers going to do? Make one of 
the biggest trades in their history and then start the 51st pick in the draft? 
Uh-uh. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Tolliver broke his collarbone in an exhibition game against Phoenix 
and was forced out of action for the first six weeks of the regular season. All 
along, Henning has been aware that his rookie is in a pretty big hurry to 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"He has certain beliefs that he brings about with himself that he's going to be 
there, that he's going to be a good quarterback, that he's going to be a 
winner," Henning said. "It's just a matter of time, and he doesn't have a lot 
of patience. He wants to do it now, and he's willing to do the things it takes 
to get it done now." 
</P>
<P>
What remains to be seen, as Henning points out, is whether Tolliver has what it 
takes to be consistent. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of rough edges, but he had a good performance," Henning said. 
"But it bears out the fact that he can do it. Now it has to be determined if he 
can do it on a regular basis, week in and week out." 
</P>
<P>
It also has to be determined whether McMahon can sit on the sidelines week in 
and week out and watch. It's hard to picture McMahon as the prototype backup, 
standing around with a baseball cap on his head holding a clipboard. 
</P>
<P>
Henning was asked Monday if McMahon has been supportive of Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," he said. "Both in practice, in the meetings and on the 
sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charger tackle Joel Patten, who missed part of Sunday's game with a hand 
injury, will be X-rayed for a possible fracture. Coach Dan Henning said it 
hasn't yet been determined whether he will be available for Sunday's game with 
Kansas City. Other Charger injuries include cornerback Sam Seale (hamstring), 
outside linebacker David Brandon (hamstring) and defensive tackle George Hinkle 
(hamstring). All three will likely play Sunday.

TURNAROUND WAS SIMPLY TAYLOR-MADE; 
</P>
<P>
49ERS: JOHN TAYLOR RECEIVES CREDIT FOR IGNITING SAN FRANCISCO'S COMEBACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Taylor dodged, danced and eluded his pursuers with ease Monday -- and that 
was after the 27-year-old wide receiver's 11-catch, 286-yard performance in the 
49ers' 30-27 victory over the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Ram defense, reporters found Taylor nearly impossible to catch after 
his team-record spree. His 286 yards exceeded the previous San Francisco record 
of 241 yards, set in 1985 by Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
"He just lets his performance speak for itself," 49er split end Mike Wilson 
said of Taylor, his road roommate. "He might celebrate a little on the plane 
home. He's still trying to prove himself as an individual player and he proved 
a lot tonight." 
</P>
<P>
He proved that opponents can't ignore him and double-cover Rice, his more 
celebrated teammate. Entering the game, Taylor had 47 receptions for 761 yards, 
an average of 16.2 per catch. Rice was by far the statistical leader with 70 
catches for 1,298 yards, an average of 18.5. Taylor eclipsed Rice last night, 
but Rice -- who had five catches for only 38 yards -- even helped him with a 
key block on Taylor's electrifying 92-yard touchdown run in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor dashed to the outside of Anthony Newman to clear his first hurdle and 
stutter-stepped past Jerry Gray to put himself in the clear and the 49ers back 
in the game, cutting the Ram lead to 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think a good wide receiver such as Jerry is just a good 
receiver," Taylor said. "But both of us just love to block, too . . . . I was 
just trying to get the least punishment possible. I just caught the ball and I 
was trying to go to daylight. I was fortunate to find it." 
</P>
<P>
Rice saw Taylor's spree as more skillful than lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"He really ran the ball well," Rice said. "They were trying to cover him 
one-on-one and John was able to capitalize on it. You can't cover him 
one-on-one. They were rolling to my side and one man was coming up trying to 
cover me, and that leaves him one-on-one. I've been working on my blocking all 
week long, so that helped." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, in his third year out of Delaware State, had only four regular-season 
touchdowns in 1988 but all were runs of 65 yards or more. Such statistics mean 
nothing to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't know how many yards he had tonight," Wilson said. "I told him, 'J. 
T., you had almost 300 yards,' and he said, 'Really?' " 
</P>
<P>
Really. 
</P>
<P>
"I came into the game hoping that we'd all have a big game because if we won, 
we'd sew up the division and the conference and we could go from there," Taylor 
said. "Getting the record feels good, but if we hadn't won it wouldn't have 
made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
The 49er win was due in no small part to his second TD run, a 95-yard sprint up 
the sideline that sliced the Ram lead to 27-23 with 8:33 to play. The crowd at 
Anaheim Stadium and the Rams themselves seemed to sag, but Taylor didn't allow 
himself to exult. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried not to think about it," he said. "We were still losing after that. We 
just wanted to try and keep pushing forward. We have to keep pushing forward 
after this because we've still got a few more games to play." 
</P>
<P>
The most emotion he allowed himself was acknowledging that Monday's victory 
over the Rams was satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
"The last three times we played the Rams, including in Tokyo, they beat us and 
we figured they had our number," Taylor said. "Winning this game was especially 
important to let them know, 'Hey, we're playing good football.' "

Alberto Tomba, Italy's No. 1 skier, will be sidelined for at least one month 
with a broken collarbone, doctors said in Bologna, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Tomba, 22, broke his left collarbone in a bad spill in a World Cup super-giant 
slalom in Val d'Isere, France, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Giorgio Fontanesi, a doctor at the Rizzoli clinic where Tomba was hospitalized, 
said Tomba will not need surgery as originally feared. 
</P>
<P>
Tomba's personal trainer, Giorgio D'Urbano, said that the skier could return 
for World Cup slaloms Jan. 14 in Bad Wiessee, West Germany, or Jan. 21 in 
Kitzbuhel, Austria.

PROMINENT SKATING COACH JIM HULICK DIES OF CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Hulick, who coached Kristi Yamaguchi and Rudi Galindo to the national 
championship in pairs figure skating this year, died of cancer at 38 Sunday 
night in a West Covina hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Hulick coached the pair for the last time at the prestigious NHK championships 
16 days ago in Kobi, Japan, where they finished fourth. Complaining of fatigue, 
Hulick checked into the hospital upon his return. 
</P>
<P>
"It always seemed like he blocked out his sickness for us," Galindo said Monday 
from his home in San Jose. "It was like he was living through us. I really do 
have admiration for him, to put all the medical things aside to do something 
for us. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget him standing there just before we would go out onto the ice 
and saying, 'Just go out there and have fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hulick, a West Covina High graduate, teamed with Cynthia Van Valkenburg in 
winning the national junior pairs championship in 1971 and began coaching four 
years later. Operating in recent years from a rink in Dublin, Calif., he had 
about 30 students before learning in August, 1988, that he had colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Although frequent trips to Southern California for treatment prevented him from 
maintaining a full schedule, he remained with Galindo and Yamaguchi. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Hulick coached Galindo to the world junior championship. The next 
year, Galindo and Yamaguchi won the world junior pairs championship. 
</P>
<P>
But the highlight of Hulick's coaching career occurred on Feb. 11 at the 
Baltimore Arena, where Yamaguchi, 17, and Galindo, 19, skated a near-perfect 
long program to win the national senior pairs championship. 
</P>
<P>
Hulick's family requested that, in lieu of flowers, contributions be sent to 
the USFSA's Memorial Fund, 20 First Street, Colorado Springs, Colo., 80906. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services will be held at 1 p.m. Thursday at Forest Lawn Chapel in 
Covina Hills.

Cal Lutheran may say he is fired but, according to Coach Bob Shoup, the last 
shot has not been heard. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some processes that are appropriate to faculty, and that's where I 
am right now," Shoup said Monday evening after returning from San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
The university issued an announcement Friday saying Shoup had been released, 
but he contends that the situation is still being resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of people met today on this issue, and I need to be updated," Shoup 
said. "It's out of the (Board of) Regents (hands), and there is a process and 
it's just starting." 
</P>
<P>
Shoup declined to name the parties involved in what he says are ongoing 
discussions, but when asked if he considered his release a finality, Shoup 
said: "I'm not sure I should answer that for fear it would be looked on as a 
challenge to the administration." 
</P>
<P>
Shoup also refused to reply to published comments by University President Jerry 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Miller took some shots, and I'm not sure exactly why," Shoup said.

NEW S&amp;L DISPOSAL AGENCY ACCUSED OF 'DOING NOTHING' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A key congressman charged Monday that the special agency created to dispose of 
failed savings and loan associations is "doing nothing" four months after 
Congress passed the S&amp;L cleanup bill. The Resolution Trust Corp. is lagging 
badly in its mission of dismantling and selling S&amp;Ls, said Rep. Bruce F. 
Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of a special House task force on RTC activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, they're not moving," the clearly frustrated Vento said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
He complained that the RTC has not issued any detailed rules or guidelines to 
help buyers who might want to purchase individual branches or other portions of 
failed institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the RTC is concentrating on trying to sell whole S&amp;Ls, hoping that 
this will reduce the ultimate cost of the rescue for taxpayers. The RTC has 
been given an initial $50 billion to spend for disposing of failed S&amp;Ls and 
paying off their depositors, whose accounts are insured up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Vento is fearful that the costs of the financial rescue will keep rising 
unless the RTC is more aggressive in finding ways to close the S&amp;Ls and 
sell their assets on a piecemeal basis, if necessary. "We've got at least 500 
institutions" that must be sold, Vento said. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, President Bush suggested Monday that the S&amp;L bailout bill may 
not have provided enough money. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted the President as saying: "It's a whale of a mess, 
and we'll see where we go. We've had this one refinancing. I am now told that 
that might not be enough." 
</P>
<P>
Bush was speaking to a group of editorial writers in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Resolution Trust Corp. has already seized 280 institutions, and at least 
200 more have been identified as likely takeover candidates because of their 
financial weakness. The imposition of tough new capital standards and the 
vagaries of uncertain real estate markets could drive the final total of failed 
S&amp;Ls even higher. 
</P>
<P>
The troubled institutions have billions of dollars in assets to be sold, 
including foreclosed office buildings, shopping centers, apartments, homes and 
other real estate. These assets "are not getting any better," and it will be 
costly to maintain them, Vento said. 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota congressman heads a special task force of the House Banking 
Committee watching closely as the RTC carries out the mandate of Congress to 
reshape a troubled industry and protect the federal insurance fund for S&amp;L 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of pent-up anger in Congress on the S&amp;L issue," Vento said. 
"Members feel they have been misled so often." 
</P>
<P>
In Vento's view, the RTC has been excessively deliberate, hoping that it can 
find large, healthy institutions to offer bids on some of the defunct thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing nothing is what I'm criticizing them for," Vento said. "They have a job, 
a mission. They can't do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
An RTC spokesman defended the agency's activities, noting that it had carried 
out 33 "resolutions" in its first two months, selling S&amp;Ls to private 
investors or closing the institutions and paying off depositors. "That effort 
was done with much more speed than is normally the case," the spokesman, 
Stephen Katsanos, said. 
</P>
<P>
But those transactions were easy ones, hastily carried out because Congress 
wanted the RTC to spend $20 billion during the fiscal year ending last Sept. 
30. The surge of spending last year will help keep down the federal deficit 
during the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC has not completed any cases in the past two months because both 
Congress and prospective buyers wanted to avoid a rush after the initial burst 
of speed, Katsanos said. "We heard considerable concern from the Congress as 
well as from potential investors . . . that they would like us to stretch out 
the time between when an S&amp;L is announced as a candidate for resolution and 
when we accept bids," he said. Investors asked for more time to prepare their 
applications to receive S&amp;Ls charters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are 20 S&amp;Ls up for sale, and some deals should be announced this 
week, Katsanos said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Vento said he had heard complaints from investors who hoped to buy 
portions of S&amp;Ls but had been unable to get help from the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
Vento's impatience with the slow pace extends to the Bush Administration, which 
has not yet named two public members to the five-member oversight board, which 
is the policy-making agency for the Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, the clock on the S&amp;L crisis continues to tick, and the 
price tag of the bail-out continues to rise," Vento said in a letter he sent to 
Bush late last week. "I hope that you will meet the new challenges and move 
promptly to fill these important vacancies." 
</P>
<P>
Congress wanted the "public representatives (to) have a real voice" in the 
activities of the oversight board, Vento said. The board's other members are 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Housing and Urban Development Secretary 
Jack Kemp, and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
Without public participants, the oversight board could become "too much an 
insider's game," Vento said in the interview.

SPIEGEL PLAYED HIGH-RISK GAME IN THRIFT INDUSTRY; 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;LS: COLUMBIA SAVINGS' TOP EXECUTIVE, WHO HAS ANNOUNCED HIS RESIGNATION, 
WAS CONSIDERED MORE AN ENTREPRENEUR THAN A TYPICAL THRIFT CHIEF. 
</P>

<P>
Columbia Savings Chairman and Chief Executive Thomas Spiegel never tried to be 
a traditional thrift executive. He rarely spoke of the thrift industry's 
mandate to make home ownership possible, or of industrywide problems such as 
interest rate risk. 
</P>
<P>
Instead Spiegel became an advocate of risky, high-yield junk bonds and a 
protege of indicted Beverly Hills trader Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, he also was labeled as a maverick, dangerous for both the risks 
that his association posed to the thrift industry's insurance fund, and the 
scrutiny that he brought to the once quiet and stodgy business. Thrift industry 
executives hope that his decision to abandon Columbia's helm and operate a junk 
bond company will end an era of controversy at one of the nation's largest 
savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel was not available for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw him as part of the savings and loan business as I grew up in it," 
said Norman Coulson, chief executive of GlenFed Inc., the parent of Glendale 
Federal Bank. "We saw him as a very bright entrepreneur but doing a very 
different kind of thing than we are doing here." 
</P>
<P>
Added another S&amp;L president who asked not to be identified: "I like Tom. 
But with all the flap in Congress about the risk taking the industry has been 
involved with, we don't need the kind of attention Columbia brings. " 
</P>
<P>
Although Spiegel never seemed to seek attention, it followed him from the 
moment that he took the helm of his father's Beverly Hills-based thrift in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel, the son of a Czechoslovakian immigrant, was barely 31 years old when 
he joined Columbia, which had been controlled by his father, Abraham, since 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
He had no experience in the savings and loan business, but three years after 
Abraham Spiegel bought 34% of Eastland Savings &amp; Loan Assn. -- later 
renamed Columbia Savings -- Tom was named president. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before Columbia became buffetted by a classic industry problem 
of lending out money for less than it cost to obtain it. The problem was 
endemic because thrifts were required to invest the majority of their funds in 
long-term, fixed rate mortgages, while their source of funds were short-term 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel has said he faced the very real possibility that Columbia would fail if 
he was unable to make sweeping changes at the thrift in a hurry. He realized 
that it took Citicorp three days to clear Columbia checks, so Spiegel decided 
to use the "float time" to his advantage by investing the money during that 
period. Citicorp's conservative chairman halted the dubious practice. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, he became enamored with Milken, who was starting Drexel 
Burnham Lambert's fledgling junk bond operations on the West Coast. Within a 
few years, Columbia became one of the nation's biggest investors in the risky, 
high-yield securities. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia prospered, at one time ranking as the nation's most profitable thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel also prospered, earning a whopping $9-million salary in 1985 -- the 
highest annual paycheck in the industry's history. 
</P>
<P>
Again, federal regulators were incensed. Calling the payment "unreasonable," 
they demanded that Spiegel give back some of the money. After fighting over the 
issue for nearly two years, the regulators relented and allowed Spiegel to keep 
the payment. But they required that his future salary be reviewed by outside 
experts to ensure that it was not excessive. 
</P>
<P>
Although his salary dropped precipitously after 1985, he continued to be the 
industry's best-paid executive, earning cash compensation of $3.75 million in 
1988 -- not to mention more than $325,000 worth of company-paid perks such as 
supplemental life insurance and the use of cars, planes and vacation homes, as 
well as accounting and legal services. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, securities regulators and the U.S. Department of Justice began to 
target Milken in the massive insider trading scandal that has rocked Wall 
Street. Spiegel, who has become one of Milken's closest friends and business 
associates, also became wrapped up in the investigation, although neither he 
nor the thrift have been charged with wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
And more recently, Spiegel has been caught up in political contribution 
scandals surrounding Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and former U.S. Rep. Tony 
Coelho. Columbia helped both politicians purchase high-yield securities that 
were not readily available to the public. However, Spiegel's supporters contend 
that his problems stem primarily from his being involved in a highly regulated 
industry.

COURT RULES A STANDOFF IN HOT PATENT CASE; 
</P>
<P>
PHARMACEUTICALS: THE DECISION MAY FORCE AMGEN AND RIVAL GENETICS INSTITUTE TO 
SPLIT THE MARKET FOR AN ANEMIA DRUG. SALES OF THE DRUG COULD EXCEED $1 BILLION 
IN THE 1990S. 
</P>

<P>
A federal judge on Monday upheld two rival patents to biotechnology's hottest 
new drug, which analysts said would force the rival companies to split up a 
market potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
The rivals, Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, and Genetics Institute of Cambridge, 
Mass., tried to invalidate each other's patent on erythropoietin, a biotech 
version of a human protein that alleviates chronic anemia in patients suffering 
everything from kidney disease and arthritis to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen won Food and Drug Administration approval last June to sell EPO and has 
been selling the drug at the rate of about $125 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Amgen got the go-ahead to sell EPO to patients suffering from kidney 
disease, some biotech analysts peg annual sales of EPO at $1 billion to $2 
billion a year in this country during the 1990s as the drug is prescribed for 
other uses. 
</P>
<P>
Genetics Institute licensed its rights to EPO to a joint venture between Chugai 
Pharmaceutical of Tokyo and Upjohn, which expects to win FDA approval to sell 
the drug in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
Many expected the 4-month-long court case to produce a landmark biotech patent 
decision. But the ruling by Judge Patti B. Saris of U.S. District Court in 
Boston narrowed each patent slightly, while ruling that each patent infringed 
upon the other. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision strikes me as a . . . standoff," said Richard Bock, senior vice 
president of the biosciences group for Sutro &amp; Co. He said it would likely 
"force the companies, if they don't contest the ruling, into a negotiated 
settlement through cross licensing." 
</P>
<P>
Genetics Institute's Garen Bohlin, senior vice president of finance, was asked 
if his company would now go ahead and reach a cross-licensing deal with Amgen. 
"We're always willing to talk about a reasonable business deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An Amgen spokesman, Mark Brand, said the company needed more time to read the 
184-page decision before deciding what it would do next. 
</P>
<P>
The court decision won't end the uncertainty for the companies, said Denise 
Gilbert, a biotech analyst with Montgomery Securities. "This decision trades 
one uncertainty for another. In a cross-licensing arrangement, we don't know 
the terms of what company would pay what." 
</P>
<P>
There remain other unsettled twists to the EPO patent saga. The U.S. Patent 
Office is currently reviewing the EPO patents, and Amgen has filed additional 
patent applications relating to EPO. Gilbert said Saris' ruling "clearly said 
that Amgen was the first to discover recombinant (biotech-engineered) EPO. It 
may clear the way for some of Amgen's strong drug patent" applications. 
</P>
<P>
EPO is a gene-spliced version of a protein found in the kidney that triggers 
essential production of red blood cells that in turn transport oxygen 
throughout the body. Patients suffering from kidney disease don't produce 
enough red bloods cells and they usually have very little energy as a result. 
</P>
<P>
The protein was discovered by scientists in 1906, but because EPO occurs in the 
body in only microscopic amounts, until biotechnology came along, the problem 
had been how to get enough of it. 
</P>
<P>
One of Amgen's scientists pulled off a remarkable bit of medical detective work 
several years ago when he found the gene that triggers production of EPO. By 
inserting the gene into Chinese hamster cells, Amgen is able to create a 
mini-cell factory that keeps reproducing the drug. There is no medical 
alternative for EPO, which is why the drug has attracted so much attention. 
</P>
<P>
Patients are given EPO by injections, usually two or three times a week. 
Valerie Buhler, who suffers from kidney disease, told The Times earlier this 
year that after taking the drug, "The difference has been remarkable. I don't 
sleep all afternoon. I have energy and zest for life." Before taking the drug, 
she said, "running a few errands just tired me out." 
</P>
<P>
This burst of energy doesn't come cheap. Annual treatments of EPO can cost 
$4,000 to $8,000 per patient, although the federal government reimburses most 
of the cost for some kidney patients. 
</P>
<P>
The Amgen and Genetics Institute EPO patents differ considerably. Amgen's 
patent covers part of the biotechnology process for making the drug, while 
Genetics Institute's patent covers a purified form of EPO that was extracted 
from urine. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial one of Amgen's attorneys dismissed Genetics Institute's patent 
as a "dwarf" because it didn't help scientists produce the drug with biotech 
methods. But Genetics Institute countered that its patent covered the final 
version of EPO that Amgen produces in its laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Genetics Institute's scientists later figured out how to make EPO through 
biotechnology and then licensed that technology to Chugai and Upjohn. 
</P>
<P>
The court decision was announced after the stock market closed. Amgen's stock 
closed Monday at $57 a share, down 75 cents. Genetics Institute's stock closed 
at $30.25, up 50 cents.

TAIWAN GAINS FOOTHOLD IN U.S. COMPUTER FIELD WITH PURCHASE OF WYSE; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: THE $262-MILLION DEAL IS TAIWAN'S LARGEST IN A GROWING STRING OF 
U.S. ACQUISITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Taiwanese government-business investment group said Monday it has agreed to 
buy personal computer supplier Wyse Technology in the latest and most dramatic 
indication of that island nation's growing acquisitions in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, valued by Wyse at more than $262 million, will represent Taiwan's 
largest purchase of a U.S. company and its first acquisition of a publicly 
traded American firm. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for Channel International Corp. to pay $10 per share for 
Wyse, an 8-year-old company best known for its personal computer screens. The 
deal with Channel, an investment group created specifically to acquire Wyse, 
had been expected for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
Although San Jose-based Wyse, whose most recent annual sales were $452 million, 
has run into considerable troubles and a fair share of red ink over the last 
year, the company offers its Taiwanese buyers a much sought after brand-name 
position in the U.S. personal computer market, including a nearly 50% share of 
the U.S. market for PC terminal screens. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tremendous business opportunity for us," said Nelson Chang, 
Channel's chairman. "Wyse has a very well-known name and a solid distribution 
channel for its products. It should give us a strong entry into the U.S. 
market." 
</P>
<P>
The purchase, subject to approval by the Taiwanese government as well as 
potential review by the U.S. government, is expected to be completed within the 
next several months. The deal is expected to provide Wyse with a much needed 
capital infusion to help it overcome its problems, which stem largely from its 
late entry into the PC clone business. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is perhaps the best illustration to date of the accelerating push by 
the Republic of China on Taiwan to acquire what it considers to be 
strategically important U.S. businesses with its growing foreign currency 
reserves of $75 billion, the second largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Although their investments have spanned the spectrum from textile plants to 
savings and loans, the Taiwanese say they are most interested in buying stakes 
in U.S. high technology companies and retail and wholesale distribution 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
The overall goal, Taiwan trade representatives say, is to modernize 
manufacturing on the island to produce goods that will command higher prices 
worldwide and to better penetrate the U.S. consumer market, the world's most 
prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
"Taiwanese companies want to be aware of the most advanced technology and learn 
marketing so we can speed up manufacturing advances at home," explained Eric 
Hwang, a marketing specialist with the Institute for Information Industry, a 
Taiwanese business- and government-supported research institute with offices in 
the Silicon Valley and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"And we need to learn how to sell in the United States so we can get closer to 
the customers of our products," Hwang added. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang said one of the best examples of his country's investment strategy is the 
$20-million purchase earlier this year of Pactel Co., a small telephone and 
electronics retail chain in the San Francisco area. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer, Great Electronics, makes facsimile machines, telephones, personal 
computers and a variety of other electronic gear sold in Pactel outlets. Great 
Electronics had been looking for a way to bring its products to the attention 
of the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
"So they bought the channel to sell their existing products and for any other 
products they want to sell in this country," Hwang explained. 
</P>
<P>
The Wyse purchase represents a similar opportunity. Wyse is a recognized brand 
name, both in PC terminals and IBM-compatible personal computers, and 
distributes its products through such established retail chains as 
Businessland. Channel officials said Monday that they intend to maintain Wyse's 
headquarters, marketing and related operations in San Jose, and they do not 
plan any changes in the existing product line. 
</P>
<P>
The members of Channel International are China Trust Group, a privately held 
entity whose principal operations include China Trust Corp. and Taiwan Cement; 
the Development Fund, a Taiwanese government investment arm; Mitac Group, a 
personal computer maker, and USI Far East Corp. The Development Fund's stake in 
Channel will be 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The Channel-Wyse deal alone exceeds the total that Taiwanese companies have 
invested in the United States in recent years. According to market researchers, 
Taiwanese companies, with the blessing of their government, invested nearly 
$250 million in U.S. businesses from 1986 through 1988, either acquiring them 
outright or buying minority stakes. 
</P>
<P>
According to research analysts, cumulative direct Taiwanese investment in the 
U.S. companies (with an ownership level officially defined as a minimum of 10% 
of a target company's voting shares) was at least $330 million as of the end of 
last year, the last available date for which figures are available. In 
addition, the Treasury Department reports that Taiwanese citizens and 
corporations hold another $27.1 billion worth of all types of U.S. securities. 
</P>
<P>
In all, analysts and trade representatives estimate, total Taiwanese investment 
in the United States exceeds $30 billion, including real estate holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Although this total pales in comparison to the holdings of the British and 
Japanese -- the two largest foreign investors in the United States -- analysts 
say the Taiwanese are among the fastest-growing investors in this country and 
are likely to accelerate their buying spree, particularly because the Taiwanese 
have recently relaxed their foreign investment rules. 
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan is becoming a real player in our economic life," said Linda Spencer, a 
policy analyst with TRW Inc. in Reston, Va., and author of "American Assets," a 
study of foreign investment in the United States. "It looks like they've made a 
real commitment to this country. And as their economy strengthens, they will 
have more money to invest here." 
</P>
<P>
However, Daniel Heiler, an analyst at the San Jose market research firm of 
Dataquest, said the rising Taiwanese investment rates could set off a backlash 
among American industry leaders, as have continuing investment moves by the 
Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Heiler said the rising cost of manufacturing on the island is forcing the 
Taiwanese to open factories in other Asian countries with lower labor costs and 
to acquire technology that will reduce production costs and speed the 
transportation of goods to consumer markets. In addition, he said, Taiwanese 
manufacturers would like to circumvent existing trade barriers to the U.S. 
market, particularly those on textile products, and to avoid potential new 
restrictions on other products. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Heiler said, Taiwanese companies are looking to develop market 
strategies that will allow them to offer brand-name products that emphasize 
quality rather than price, as has been the case. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Wyse deal, although in the prized high-technology sector, 
stands out for two reasons: its size and the fact that the investors purchased 
the entire company rather than a minority share. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, analysts said, Taiwanese investors have preferred to sprinkle their 
money around in a variety of companies in the hopes of gaining the most 
information about a variety of U.S. businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But the more familiar the Taiwanese have become with the American economy, the 
more they have been willing to invest. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Acer, a Taiwanese manufacturer of low-cost personal computers, 
spent just $4.4 million for Counterpoint Computers, a small start-up it 
purchased in 1987. But more recent deals, such as Continental Engineering's 
acquisition of American Bridge, a former USX Corp. subsidiary in Pittsburgh, 
for as much as $100 million, have demonstrated Taiwan's increasing interest in 
U.S. businesses. 
</P>

At the same time, Taiwanese trade representatives say, their government has 
been trying to discourage their citizens and corporations from buying U.S. real 
estate, traditionally one of the most attractive American investments for 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
"When we invest, we want to learn something," said Eric Chiang, a spokesman for 
the Taiwanese government's Coordination Council for North American Affairs, the 
equivalent of a general consulate. "Real estate just involves capital; we want 
to learn manufacturing and marketing techniques from the United States. And the 
way to do that is to get involved in their businesses."

Dealers Advised to Boost Chevrolet Orders: The Chevrolet division of General 
Motors Corp. has warned its dealers in a special bulletin to order more cars or 
the company would be forced to idle assembly plants in January, a weekly trade 
publication reported. The bulletin is unprecedented because it discloses 
January production rates and how they compare to dealer order banks, said 
Automotive News. Chevrolet plans to build nearly 91,000 new cars next month, 
while order banks as of late November stood at just 24,130 units, the letter 
said.

Man Charged With Attempted Smuggling: A Las Vegas man was arrested last week at 
Los Angeles International Airport and charged with attempting to illegally 
export restricted high-technology materials, federal authorities said. Joseph 
Nandori, a Hungarian native who authorities said is about 50 years old, was 
arrested while waiting to board a flight to Budapest. Brooks Ohlson, a special 
agent with the Commerce Department's Office of Export Enforcement, said Nandori 
was carrying computer technical manuals, computer software and scientific 
instruments.

LAWYER URGES FREEZING KEATING ASSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer for small investors in the parent of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan argued 
Monday in federal court in Los Angeles that the corporation was run for the 
benefit of Charles H. Keating Jr. and his family and that a federal judge 
therefore can order a worldwide freeze of Keating family assets. 
</P>
<P>
Some 22,000 investors claim in a class-action lawsuit that the $200 million in 
debt securities they purchased at 29 Southern California branches of the Irvine 
thrift provided Keating with a lavish life style and bank accounts in Europe 
and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
But whether as Lincoln or as its parent firm, American Continental Corp. in 
Phoenix, the business is controlled by Keating, said Joseph W. Cotchett Jr. of 
Burlingame, one of the lawyers for the bondholders. That control gives 
investors the right to go after Keating's personal assets, he charged. 
</P>
<P>
But a lawyer for the beleaguered Arizona businessman contended that Keating 
never held himself out as being personally responsible to the small investors 
and that they do not have a right to freeze his personal funds. 
</P>
<P>
James Ham of Los Angeles also said Keating had no funds in foreign bank 
accounts, as the investors allege. And American Continental spokesman Bradley 
J. Boland, one of Keating's sons-in-law, said after the hearing that the 
company is fighting in various courts to revive itself and pay off bondholders 
and other creditors. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson decided to continue the hearing to 
Dec. 21 to give himself time to read additional documents filed in the case. 
The hearing, Wilson said, could be canceled if he decides for Keating on the 
basis of the written arguments. 
</P>
<P>
The bondholders sued Keating and others in a series of fraud and civil 
racketeering lawsuits in state and federal courts over the April collapse of 
Lincoln and American Continental. The holding company filed for bankruptcy 
protection on April 13, and regulators seized Lincoln the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's failure could be the costliest ever, with taxpayers picking up a 
$2-billion bill. 
</P>
<P>
Plaintiffs in the latest suit claim that much of the money raised through the 
bond sales -- some $34 million -- went to salaries, stock purchases and other 
benefits for Keating and his family. More money was spent on such lavish items 
as three corporate jets even as the company was struggling financially, 
Cotchett claimed. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks to freeze what investors say is more than $100 million in assets 
of Keating and his family in such places as Switzerland, Panama and the 
Bahamas. Keating, however, in a written court statement, said American 
Continental's connections with overseas banks and brokerage houses were 
strictly for foreign currency trading and for consulting fees on such trading. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not have bank accounts at any of these banks," he said. "I do not have 
any overseas bank accounts. I am not aware, nor do I believe, that any of my 
family maintain (sic) bank accounts at any of these banks, or for that matter, 
at any overseas bank."

FORMER MILKEN ASSOCIATE TO TESTIFY FOR U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: EX-DREXEL JUNK BOND EXECUTIVE GARY WINNICK HAS BEEN ORDERED TO 
APPEAR. HE WILL RECEIVE IMMUNITY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have added another prominent close associate of Michael 
Milken to the list of government witnesses who will testify against him. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Winnick, 42, the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert's convertible bonds 
department, was given a federal court order last week granting him immunity 
from prosecution and compelling him to testify against Milken and others in the 
criminal racketeering case pending against the former Drexel junk bond chief. 
</P>
<P>
Winnick's lawyer, Gary P. Naftalis, confirmed that Winnick "received compelled 
immunity under court order" and said that "under the court order, he has to 
answer questions when he's asked." 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the case said Winnick had been seeking a deal with prosecutors 
for some months because of fear that he might become a target of the federal 
investigation. The sources said the government has subpoenaed records from 
Winnick. But Naftalis said Winnick had never been notified that he was a 
target. The lawyer said any testimony that Winnick gives will be as a result of 
the court order obtained by prosecutors and not because of a voluntary 
agreement to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
When Winnick left Drexel in 1985, he became head of Pacific Asset Holdings 
Limited Partnership, a Beverly Hills-based partnership in which Milken holds a 
large stake. The partnership was established to invest in junk bonds and 
leveraged buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said prosecutors expect that Winnick will testify about allegations 
that Milken in effect gave kickbacks to managers of mutual funds to induce them 
to buy junk bonds of doubtful value. The inducements are said to have included 
valuable warrants -- the right to buy stock in a certain company at a certain 
price within a fixed period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Naftalis refused to comment on which subjects the government hopes Winnick will 
testify about. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, his brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg were named 
in a 98-count racketeering indictment returned in March, stemming from alleged 
securities fraud and insider trading at Drexel. Milken resigned from Drexel in 
June and has formed his own company, International Capital Access Group. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury in New York is expected to return a new, expanded 
indictment in the case, although some sources say it may not be finalized until 
January. As reported, the indictment is expected to contain additional charges 
and name additional defendants, including Warren Trepp, Drexel's chief junk 
bond trader; Alan Rosenthal, a former head of Drexel's convertible bond unit, 
and former Drexel bond salesman Peter Gardiner. 
</P>
<P>
At least half a dozen former close Milken associates have agreed to testify 
against him or are believed to be close to an agreement. Among those who have 
already agreed are Cary J. Maultasch, a former Drexel stock and bond trader; 
Charles Thurnher, who kept financial records in Drexel's Beverly Hills junk 
bond office; Terren Peizer, a Drexel trader, and James Dahl, a former Drexel 
bond salesman. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Milken have declined to comment on the investigation or Winnick, 
and they have charged that leaks about the continuing grand jury inquiry are 
unfair and will make it difficult for Milken to get a fair trial. Prosecutors 
also have declined to comment on the investigation.

AT&amp;T PLANS TO CUT 8,500 JOBS DURING 1990

Escalating its long-running battle to trim costs, American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co. said Monday that it will cut about 8,500 positions in 1990, 
adding to about 25,000 eliminated in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The company has already cut overall employment from 374,000 at the time of the 
breakup of the Bell System in 1984 to 298,000 at the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T said some of the cutbacks were made possible by new digital telephone 
equipment that eliminates some work. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T spokesman Walter Murphy said some of the job cuts will come through an 
early retirement plan. About 12,000 of 34,000 employees eligible have accepted 
a special pension option to the plan announced in October, and more may sign up 
before year-end, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The special pension plan departures could reduce the company's work force to 
about 286,000 by the end of the year, although Gray said its purchase of the 
British firm Istel adds 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a continuing process at AT&amp;T," Murphy said. He said 2,000 workers 
had accepted an earlier pension offer, 6,000 left by attrition, and 5,000 
operator positions were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction in operator posts is part of the job cuts announced in December, 
1988, when AT&amp;T took a $6.72-billion writedown for network improvements and 
said it would cut 10,000 Network Services jobs.

Stock prices fell in featureless trading Monday amid investor uncertainty about 
the economy and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials fell 3.20 points to 2,728.24 after 
gaining 10.66 points in Friday's session. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outpaced advances by a 5-to-4 margin in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 844 issues down, 669 up and 477 
unchanged. Traders said high-technology stocks led the losers after two 
brokerages lowered the investment ratings of Compaq and Apple computer 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts attributed the market's overall weakness to investor 
uncertainty about the prospects for the economy and to profit taking after 
Friday's modest rally. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 147.13 million shares, up from 144.91 million in 
Friday's session. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Pinnacle West, the most active stock, 
fell 5/8 to 10 3/8; Compaq Computer dropped 4 1/4 to 81 5/8 after First Boston 
Corp. downgraded the stock's investment rating; IBM lost 3/4 to 96 1/8, and 
Pfizer tumbled 1 1/2 to 67 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer, the most active stock on the over-the-counter list, dropped 2 
1/2 to 39 1/4 after Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. lowered its investment rating and 
earnings estimate for the company.

Bond Prices Dip in Absence of News 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell slightly in light trading in the absence of major economic 
news. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1/16 point, or under $1 per $1,000 
face amount. Its yield was unchanged from late Friday at 7.88%. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were pressured downward by a rise in oil and gold prices and a 
decline in the dollar, said Greg Jones, an economist and market analyst for MMS 
International in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.438%, unchanged from late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Changes in Germany Benefit the Mark 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended mostly lower against key foreign currencies in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said firm interest rates in West Germany, political reforms in 
East Germany and speculation of further interest rate increases were supporting 
the mark at the dollar's expense. 
</P>
<P>
Also depressing the U.S. currency were reports that the Federal Reserve sold 
dollars for yen as part of an effort to improve the trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose 0.38 Japanese yen to close at 144.65 yen. It traded at 144.47 yen in 
London, and at 144.375 yen in New York, up from 144.30 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was weaker against the British pound, with sterling buying $1.5895 
in London, up from $1.5793 late Friday. The pound fetched $1.5937 in New York, 
up from $1.5825.

COMMODITIES

<P>
Gold Prices Surge Near High for Year 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures prices rose to within a few dollars of new 1989 highs on New 
York's Commodity Exchange as the market extended its recovery for a fifth day 
from a steep post-Thanksgiving decline. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, orange juice futures rose sharply on Florida freeze 
fears; cotton futures rebounded; energy futures gained; pork futures fell; 
cattle futures rose, and grains and soybeans were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $4.90 to $5.50 higher, with the contract for delivery in 
December up $5 at $416.80 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
The December contract reached an intra-day high of $418 an ounce, just $1.70 
below the 1989 high of $419.70 reached Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Silver futures finished 4.5 to 4.9 cents higher, with December at $5.692 an 
ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 2.45 to 3.75 cents higher, with 
January at $1.313 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton futures also climbed sharply in a move that analysts viewed as a 
technical correction after several sessions in which prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton settled 0.60 to 1.73 cent higher, with March at 67.91 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Heating oil continued to lead energy prices higher on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange as extremely cold temperatures in Europe spurred demand for fuel oil 
on the world market. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 to 23 cents higher, with January 
at $20.70 a barrel; heating oil was 0.15 cent lower to 0.58 cent higher, with

MARKETING: ADS OF '90S WILL GO 'ONE-ON-ONE' WITH CONSUMERS, AIM FOR THE HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until now, the rules of advertising have always been simple enough. 
</P>
<P>
Assume that the viewer has the intelligence of an artichoke. State the name of 
the product at least once every millisecond. Don't ever advertise such 
sure-fire snoozers as the safety features of products. Avoid those 
larger-than-life -- if not murky -- issues like the eroding environment. Keep 
the length of TV commercials to a manageable minute, at most. And try to create 
ads that appeal to the most diverse audience possible -- say, the entire 
Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
Well, folks, those were the old rules. And they may have been darned good for 
the 1950s, '60s, '70s and much of the '80s. But they won't fly in the '90s. In 
fact, say top executives from many of the nation's largest ad firms, it's going 
to be a brave new world of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"The rules, as we've known them, will all go out the window," said Ed Wax, 
president and chief executive of the New York agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi 
Advertising, which creates ads for Burger King and Tide detergent. "The rules 
used to work because consumers were predictable. About the only thing that's 
predictable now is that when viewers don't like your ad, they'll zap it." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, not only will advertising look different in the '90s, it will also 
try to approach consumers differently. 
</P>
<P>
"The '90s will be the decade of one-on-one advertising," said Graham Phillips, 
chairman and chief executive of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, which creates 
ads for such companies as American Express and Seagram. "Advertising will 
become much more personal as industries try to zero in on their targets." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Phillips predicts that during the next decade it will be relatively 
common for households to receive on their cable-TV stations commercials that 
are specifically selected for them. And a number of magazines' subscribers will 
discover ads inside the publications that were specifically written for them -- 
with their names appearing in them. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't just the advertising business any more," Phillips said. "It's the 
marketing services business." 
</P>
<P>
Some executives say that, over the next decade, marketing researchers will stop 
at nothing to find out information on consumers. "Big Brother will be watching 
and listening like never before," said Los Angeles ad man and consultant Stan 
Freberg. "It's J. Edgar Hoover as J. Walter Thompson." 
</P>
<P>
In the '90s, advertising agencies will be asked to do a lot more than create 
ads. "Agencies that want to keep their clients will have to offer more 
strategic ideas for marketing products," said Robert Schmidt, chairman of the 
New York agency Levine, Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver, which creates ads for 
Subaru and Dreyfus Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The business of advertising will become a lot more than that of simply grabbing 
the attention of TV viewers and magazine readers. In the '90s, carefully 
crafted and psychologically driven ads will become the benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
"If you know what car someone drives and what magazine he reads, you can get a 
pretty good idea of what he's like," said Ogilvy's Phillips. "And the more you 
know about someone, the more likely you are to create advertising that can push 
his or her button." 
</P>
<P>
For those ad executives with a background in psychology, the '90s could be 
their decade. "There will be a lot less bean counting and a lot more in-depth, 
psychological probing to know all the nuances of consumers," said Charles D. 
Peebler Jr., chief executive of the New York-based Bozell, which creates ads 
for Chrysler and American Airlines. "We will all need a deeper understanding of 
what makes people tick." 
</P>
<P>
For years, advertisers have been basically satisfied if people just remember 
their ads. That might not be good enough in the '90s. "The Holy Grail will no 
longer be an ad recall score," said Richard Fizdale, president of Leo Burnett, 
the Chicago agency that develops ads for Oldsmobile and Kellogg Co. "The 
question won't be, 'Did you remember the ad?' The question will be, 'Did it 
persuade you to act?' " 
</P>
<P>
How to persuade? 
</P>
<P>
Well, advertisers are already latching onto some of those issues that they 
believe will hit closest to the hearts of consumers during the '90s: health, 
safety and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"The environment will be the driving force of the '90s," said ad chief Schmidt. 
"It wouldn't surprise me to see companies like Exxon running five-minute 
editorial ads that explain their points of view on certain environmental 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
Executives say this is a monumental change. "A few years ago, the surest way 
for a commercial to fail was for it to sell safety or talk about health 
issues," said Norman W. Brown, chairman and chief executive of FCB 
Communications Inc., the giant Chicago ad firm that handles ads for Mazda and 
the California Raisin Advisory Board. "But the environment and health 
considerations have started to become important to a significant number of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Some predict that the environment may become to advertising of the '90s what 
nostalgia was to advertising of the '80s. "It's much bigger than McDonald's," 
said Fizdale, of his agency's biggest client, which recently began to install 
separate trash bins at some stores for paper and non-paper waste. "Every single 
client is going to have to respond to the 'green' movement." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, product advertisements that may appear more akin to public service 
spots -- and that have a greater awareness of the frailty of life on earth -- 
may fill our TV screens in the '90s, said Richard Lord, chairman of Lord 
Einstein O'Neill &amp; Partners in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"A little while ago, my agency was considering taking on a fur account," Lord 
said. "But then we realized no one in the creative department was willing to 
work on it. Something like that was unthinkable not too many years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Lord's agency recently began to film a series of ads for car maker Saab that 
look the safety issue square in the eyeball. Lord doesn't want to reveal the 
content of the ads, which won't air until March. But he says they will attempt 
to show dramatically that Saab is one of the safest cars sold. "Will that help 
us sell cars?" poses Lord. "You bet it will." 
</P>
<P>
Then, there are those executives who say they aren't much interested in 
hitching on to any trends. Nor do they think they can forecast the future. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can predict what advertising will be like in the 1990s," said Philip B. 
Dusenberry, chairman of the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, which creates 
ads for Pepsi. "Most of those predictions are a lot of baloney. But with all 
the new brands that will be on the market in the '90s, that will require even 
more personal -- perhaps, more emotional -- advertising. You know, advertising 
that is closer to the bone." 
</P>
<P>
During much of the '80s, the techniques used to film ads became trendier than 
the ideas that were in the ads themselves, said Jay Chiat, chairman of 
Chiat/Day/Mojo in Venice, creator of spots for Eveready batteries that feature 
the mechanical bunny that walks off the set. "You had things like the MTV look 
and the shaky-camera look being knocked off consistently. They all became 
techniques without ideas." 
</P>
<P>
But one thing that was true in the '80s will still be true for advertising in 
the '90s, Chiat said. "There's no substitute for a great idea." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lexus Recall Won't Be End of 'Perfection' Ads 
</P>
<P>
It had to be plenty embarrassing for the new Lexus division of Toyota to recall 
most of its cars last week. But imagine how red-faced executives were at the 
company's El Segundo ad agency, which has portrayed the car as being virtually 
flawless. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, agency executives are keeping a stiff upper lip. "All we've been 
getting to date are compliments about the car," said Jim Hirschboeck, president 
of Team One Advertising, a division of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS, which last 
week also picked up the Lexus advertising account in Australia. As for the 
Lexus recall, said Hirschboeck, "We don't see this as a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recall of 8,000 Lexus LS 400 models -- to make three minor repairs 
on each vehicle -- the agency says Lexus will continue to stick with the ad 
slogan: The relentless pursuit of perfection. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're pursuing something relentlessly," said Hirschboeck, "it suggests 
you'll never attain your goal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paul Newman Does Ad for American Express 
</P>
<P>
Paul Newman seems to have finally caved in to Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The renowned actor, who has declined for years to appear as a product spokesman 
on American television, has filmed a commercial for American Express that some 
expect may air in late January during the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Both American Express and Newman's public relations firm declined to comment on 
the story line of the commercial, which was filmed late last month in 
Bakersfield by the ad agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather. 
</P>
<P>
But Newman's Los Angeles publicist says he will probably donate all the 
proceeds to charity. "If I were a betting man," said Warren J. Cowan, chairman 
of Rogers &amp; Cowan, "I'd say that's where the money will go." Newman's food 
company, which makes spaghetti sauce and popcorn, has donated more than $20 
million to charity. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at American Express -- who are also said to be negotiating with 
actress Meryl Streep -- say they have tried to get Newman to star in an ad for 
nearly 10 years. Advertisers see it as a major coup to land any celebrity that 
the general public knows won't appear in ads. After all, it can greatly add to 
any product's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Rival Visa recently signed ex-Beatle Paul McCartney to a high-profile contract. 
American Express executives say McCartney aides approached them about 
sponsoring his concert tour, but they declined when it became clear that the 
multi-city tour could not make tickets for his concerts readily available to 
American Express cardholders. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited to be working with someone of Paul Newman's stature," said 
Nancy Muller, vice president of public affairs at American Express. "'It's a 
tribute to the personal bond he has with American Express." 
</P>
<P>
And yes, Newman is a longtime cardholder.

STOCK DEAL INVESTIGATION TARGETS DAIWA 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
Major brokerage Daiwa Securities is under investigation by Japan's Finance 
Ministry for allegedly violating securities law, in what appears to be another 
Japanese stock scandal. 
</P>
<P>
When stock recommendations went sour, Daiwa allegedly offered its favored 
corporate clients special stock deals that guaranteed illegal profits to make 
up for losses. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has opened a probe of Daiwa's alleged loss-free 
transactions, which violate Japan's Securities and Exchange Law. 
</P>
<P>
Daiwa officials said Monday that the company did cover losses of 20 to 30 
customers totaling about $69.4 million (10 billion yen), but these were not 
guaranteed loss-free deals. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Daiwa had not promised any compensation for loss to the 
customers but decided to cover some to maintain good relations. 
</P>
<P>
The Daiwa scandal is the latest load of the stock market's dirty laundry that 
the media have hung out for the public to see. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, police arrested a Nomura Securities employee and a Kawasaki city 
employee. The Nomura employee is suspected of selling prelisted stock to the 
Kawasaki official in return for managing a larger share of the city's pension 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
But at the top of the list was the Recruit affair, the worst postwar political 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
A number of politicians reaped large profits by buying stock in a real estate 
unit of Recruit Co. before the shares were listed and then selling the stock 
after it started trading on the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
Public outrage over the Recruit scandal caused a few prominent politicians to 
step down from office and was a major reason that the ruling Liberal Democratic 
Party lost its majority in July's upper house elections, according to polls and 
political analysts. 
</P>
<P>
General elections are expected in February and -- if not hushed up -- the Daiwa 
affair may be taken as yet another symbol of Japan's elite doing favors for one 
another, with the ruling party looking on benignly, if not actually taking part 
in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing the Finance Ministry wants in pre-election times, when people 
are still goosey about Recruit and minor scandals, is to create more of a stink 
than they have to," said one veteran analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (the Finance Ministry) said this is illegal, it could be really 
scandalous and affect the elections like Recruit," said Hitoshi Yamamoto, 
president of Morgan Grenfell International Asset Management Co. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers say loss-free trades abound because they are difficult to prove and 
stock regulations in Japan are often loosely enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone in the securities business should not find this a surprise," said 
strategist Craig Chudler at Smith New Court. 
</P>
<P>
"In Japan the (broker's) relationship with the corporation is always the most 
important thing," said Yamamoto. "There is no chance brokers will make a 
guaranteed return agreement with private investors, only institutional 
investors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the Daiwa scandal) is one of the things that bubbles to the surface 
providing a relatively clear view of the way these things are done in Japan," 
said Perry Gary, a senior manager at AMRO International (Asia) Ltd. "It is not 
a Daiwa affair so much as it is an example of an establishment affair. It goes 
back to the structure of Japanese society." 
</P>
<P>
The society's longtime practice of guaranteed returns stems from a web of 
give-and-take relationships, such as when a bank employee rewards a new 
customer with a Paddington Bear piggy bank. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have big business you help your customer and if there are losses you 
try to erase them," said one analyst.

CONTRACT BRIGHTENS CLOUDY NASSCO FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
SHIPBUILDING: LOOMING DEFENSE CUTS CONTINUE TO PLAGUE THE ONLY REMAINING 
SHIPYARD ON THE WEST COAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A contract to build the third in a series of combat supply ships for the Navy 
promises to pull San Diego-based National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. out of 
the red for the first time in two years, but impending defense cuts have put 
the future of the recently restructured company in jeopardy, executives said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Navy so far has agreed to buy three of the high-speed fuel and 
munitions supply ships, there are no guarantees that it will go forward with an 
option to buy a fourth,said Fred Hallett, Nassco's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the (supply ships), we would not have a yard here in San Diego," 
Hallett said. "We have until 1993, (when the last of the three ships is 
expected to be delivered to the Navy), but that obviously doesn't put us out of 
the woods yet." 
</P>
<P>
A management-led buyout in April saved the financially troubled company -- the 
only remaining shipbuilding company on the West Coast -- from the fate of 44 
other American shipyards forced to close during the past eight years. Putting 
their personal assets up as collateral, a four-member management group found 
funding to buy the shipyard from its former owner, Morrison-Knudsen of Boise, 
Ida., which had planned to sink the shipyard after taking a record $30-million 
loss in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The contract for the supply ships -- vessels that are designed to keep pace 
with groups of combat ships at a 25-knot clip while carrying a maximum load of 
150,000 barrels of fuel and 1,800 tons of munitions -- will keep the company 
afloat by providing a steady source of revenue and jobs for about 3,100 people, 
Hallett said. 
</P>
<P>
Pieced together out of 100-ton steel blocks, each 754-foot-long ship takes 
about three years to build. Each will be manned by a crew of 667. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the three ships, known as AOE-6 (military shorthand for auxiliary 
oiler explosives), awaits its maiden voyage from an inclined ways, or 
framework, where it still must be outfitted with a hull, deck and house. Next 
in line, AOE-7, lies in unassembled blocks on the shipyard, while work on AOE-8 
has yet to begin. 
</P>
<P>
With each supply ship bringing in about $197 million, Nassco executives expect 
to show a profit in 1989 for the first time in three years, Hallett said. If 
the Navy exercises its option to buy a fourth and final supply ship next year, 
Nassco can expect to earn $1 billion in revenue in 1989 dollars, Hallett said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the company has a long way to go before it equals its former production 
peak, achieved in 1981, when it delivered four ships in a single year. Under 
the current Navy contract, Nassco isn't scheduled to deliver a single ship 
until the fall of 1991, when the first of the Navy supply ships is expected to 
be launched. The remaining two are expected to be delivered in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ship repairs are the only other work keeping Nassco employees busy. 
Work on the shipyard's most famous repair job, the damaged Exxon Valdez 
supertanker, which caused the largest oil spill in U.S. history when it ran 
aground in Alaska earlier this year, is expected to be completed by summer. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike scores of other American shipyards, Nassco has managed to stay in 
business despite financial troubles and a worsening shipbuilding climate. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts tend to blame foreign shipyards, operating with the help of 
government subsidies, for the downturn in American shipbuilding, as well as the 
Reagan Administration, which eliminated a domestic subsidy program that allowed 
U.S. companies to compete with foreign ones. 
</P>
<P>
In the past eight years, the American shipbuilding industry has lost about 
34,000 jobs. And none of the 800 or so commercial shipbuilding contracts 
awarded worldwide last year went to American shipyards, said Patrick Morris, 
vice president and general counsel for the Shipbuilders Council of America in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Shipbuilding experts estimate that military contracts now make up about 95% of 
the U. S. shipbuilding industry, whereas, in 1976, only about half the ships 
built in the United States were for the military. 
</P>
<P>
With the Soviet Union posing less of a threat and military defense spending 
cuts sure to follow, those figures are a source of worry to American shipyard 
executives, who have become ever more hungry for a share of the world's 
commercial shipbuilding contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"If the military budget is going to go down, you're going to have to replace 
those orders with something else," Morris said. "We're trying to create a more 
hospitable environment in the commercial arena." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the Shipbuilding Council filed a petition in June under the 1974 
Omnibus Trade Act alleging that Japan, West Germany, Norway and South Korea are 
all engaged in unfair trading practices. Commerce Department officials, if they 
agree with the petition's allegations, may seek sanctions, such as boycotts, 
against a country found to be in violation of fair trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
"We, in our judgment, conclusively document that they are engaged in subsidy 
practices, varying from financial scheme to direct subsidies," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
A month after filing the petition, however, the council withdrew its request 
after each country agreed to send trade representatives to the Organization of 
Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
If no agreement is reached by March 31, U.S. shipbuilding interests intend to 
file another petition, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American shipbuilding companies are on the offensive, lobbying for 
the same public support that won economic sanctions against foreign steel and 
auto companies believed to be competing unfairly against U.S.-based companies. 
</P>
<P>
A Nassco position paper issued last month stated: "The sight of bulldozers 
ripping holes in the Berlin Wall is a powerful reminder that America will need 
to make the transition from a Cold War economy to a more commercially oriented, 
non-defense economy during the 1990s. For Nassco and the U.S. shipbuilding 
industry, changes in military strategies and probable cuts in defense budges 
now and in the future likely will reduce the country's spending on new U. S. 
Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, there is another worldwide market that is available to Nassco, if 
we can only open it to fair competition." 
</P>
<P>
That market is, of course, the commercial market. And its importance to the 
future of the shipbuilding industry is clear to anyone who wields a blow torch 
on the dry docks -- especially anyone with a stake in a company's future 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Godinez, business manager for the Ironworkers Local 627, representing 
about 1,100 iron workers at Nassco, said the manager-employee buyout has made 
the workers more interested in decisions that have an impact on the company. 
Workers who last year staged a strike to protest scheduled wage cuts are now 
aligned with managers in the push for a fair and competitive world shipbuilding 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at new construction to stay in business in order to keep food 
on the table and to keep the guys working," Godinez said. "We feel we're not on 
an even keel (with foreign shipyards.) There's no way we can win any 
shipbuilding contracts when we're up against the foreign countries who 
subsidize their shipyards."

POINSETTIA RANCH READY FOR PEAK HOLIDAY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the hectic time of year for Paul Ecke Poinsettia Ranch, the Encinitas 
flower farm where about 65 types of poinsettias in a variety of sizes, shapes 
and colors are grown and shipped to florists and nurseries throughout Southern 
California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch prides itself on developing new kinds of poinsettias and this year 
introduced a yellow variety called lemon drop. In past years, Ecke brought out 
jingle bells, a red-leafed plant with pink speckles, and pink peppermint. 
Exotic poinsettias can cost up to $500, but the average plant goes for about 
$20. 
</P>
<P>
The Ecke ranch is a highly seasonal employer with payroll peaking at 300 this 
time of year. But payroll also shoots up in the summer when the ranch ships 
seedlings to growers in 65 countries. Ecke thinks of itself as a flower breeder 
as much as grower. 
</P>
<P>
The Ecke family has been synonymous with poinsettias since 1906, when Albert 
Ecke, the father of patriarch Paul Ecke Sr., opened a flower ranch in 
Hollywood. The operation was moved to Encinitas in 1924 and now occupies 
hundreds of acres, including 35 acres covered with greenhouses. Paul Ecke, now 
95, is "still in good health, comes to work everyday and checks the 
greenhouses," a spokeswoman said. CHRIS KRAUL

'DOWNSIDE': FUNNYLOOK AT CORPORATE SCRUPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Think how many sitcoms have centered about the gang down at work -- "Cheers," 
"Taxi," the old Mary Tyler Moore show. The gang may bicker a lot, but they care 
about each other and try to put out a good product. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way we Americans like to see ourselves, and it may account for a 
certain hesitation in the laughter (considerable) generated by Richard 
Dresser's "The Downside" at the Pasadena Playhouse Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
If the program didn't tell us that Dresser has sitcom experience (he wrote for 
"The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd"), we could guess it from the expert way he 
sets up a punch line in "The Downside." We don't know what the joke is going to 
be, but we can feel it being launched, and it comes in right on the button. 
</P>
<P>
Dresser puts out a good product himself. But "The Downside" has its doubts 
about the American workplace at the end of the 1980s, and that may account for 
the uneasiness of response Sunday. Perhaps it was the uneasiness of 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Quick with the quip as they are, the office gang in this play isn't even 
remotely lovable. And not very smart either. The nonsense level in their 
industry has risen to the point where the truth of a situation is laughably 
irrelevant, even if human lives are at stake (as applies, their industry being 
pharmaceuticals). 
</P>
<P>
What's "key," to borrow from their jargon (Dresser has great fun doing so), is 
how things are going to look -- to top management, to the FDA, to the public. 
So, you do what has to be done: Cut a few corners, pretend you haven't seen the 
lab report, get an aging associate fired. He was dead in the water anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Actor John Getz is particularly deft at implying that there's a certain heroism 
involved with being a corporate rat -- that at certain moments a man must 
selflessly sacrifice his own morality so that others may live. Does Getz 
believe it? It's hard to know what anybody in the marketing department at Mark 
and Maxwell really believes. It's not exactly something you discuss at 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign of the moment is to get a certain stress-reducer into the 
marketplace ahead of the competition, even if there's a little problem with 
possible side effects due to "a slight reformulation for manufacturing 
purposes." (Again, Dresser has a perfect ear for the phrase that says nothing.) 
</P>
<P>
If it's funny to see how much stress is needed to get a stress-reducer on the 
market, it's also disquieting to realize that the sitcom-style exaggerations of 
the play aren't that exaggerated. No, a young executive with problems at home 
(Matt Salinger) probably wouldn't actually take to living in his office, 
particularly after he had been fired. 
</P>
<P>
But strange things do go on in those glassy towers out on the turnpike after 
everybody has gone home for the night, and also during business hours. Actor 
Eddie Jones is outstanding as an older executive who can pull himself together 
beautifully at a conference, but who is a disaster area when alone -- and he's 
making some big decisions in that top office. 
</P>
<P>
Then for pure comic relief we get James Eckhouse as Carl, one of those 
middle-management types who survives by not understanding the situation -- 
whose major skill is in making all of his colleagues look good by comparison. 
No matter how severe the "restructuring" of a company, the Carls always 
survive, like cockroaches. Ain't it the truth. 
</P>
<P>
As for romance, this office is not immune to it, although romance is not 
exactly the term. Megan Mullaly plays Roxanne, a secretary to whom the most 
extraordinary things happen over the weekend, and Meagen Fay is Diane, a junior 
executive to whom nothing at all happens. They learn something from each other, 
but not necessarily something positive. 
</P>
<P>
"The Downside" will make you think of "Working Girl" and "How to Succeed in 
Business Without Really Trying" (certainly Carl's method). But it also may 
suggest Ibsen's "Enemy of the People," with its skeptical view of what men and 
women really are once their self-interest is threatened. 
</P>
<P>
And Kelly Connell as a nerd named Stan may remind us, when we see where he ends 
up, of the merger mania that struck American business in the 1980s. This is a 
timely play, and therefore an edgy one. It would work better on a set less 
spacious and detailed than that designed by Deborah Raymond and Dorian 
Vernacchio. This production goes less briskly than the original at the Long 
Wharf Theatre two seasons ago, also directed by Kenneth Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
But "The Downside" is largely upside, including Paul Guilfoyle's performance as 
a "film maker" doing a cinema verite documentary on the company -- i.e., a 
commercial. Pure Hollywood, and pure hysteria. 
</P>

'ENEMIES' IS A NEAR-PERFECT, BITTERSWEET TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
You might hope that the pairing of Isaac Bashevis Singer, a writer who couples 
eroticism with wisdom, and Paul Mazursky, whose best films have been both juicy 
and insightful, would be a good one. But who could have predicted this? 
</P>
<P>
"Enemies, A Love Story" (Wednesday at AMC Century 14) is stunning, a richly 
satisfying, perfectly realized film. Although there are still a few more movies 
to see before the season's end, this one may be the year's finest and most 
complex; clearly it's the best of Mazursky's career. But it's something more, 
the brilliant dovetailing of a writer's intentions and a film maker's mature 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
There's the same wholeness of understanding here that permeated the best of 
John Huston's films, "The African Queen" or "Fat City" or "The Dead"; 
adaptations that felt so full and so right that when you re-read the books, the 
characters and the actors merged. Now Mazursky, who co-adapted this screenplay 
with Roger L. Simon, has found in Singer his perfect author and the pleasure is 
all ours. 
</P>
<P>
The time is 1949, the place is New York; more specifically the corners of New 
York that have become havens for Jewish refugees from Hitler's deviltry. In 
Coney Island we find Herman Broder (Ron Silver), who eluded the Nazis by hiding 
in the hayloft of a Polish farm but whose nightmares about his ordeal are far 
from behind him. With him is his blond Polish wife Yadwiga (Margaret Sophie 
Stein), his family's former servant, who saved his life and whom he has since 
married, as much from gratitude as anything else. 
</P>
<P>
In the Bronx lives Herman's passionate mistress Masha (Lena Olin, she of the 
bowler hat in "Unbearable Lightness of Being"), who with her mother (Judith 
Malina) has survived the camps. And soon on the scene is the first of the 
shocks to Herman's somewhat jangled system: Natasha (Anjelica Huston), his 
first wife, whom eyewitnesses had reported shot by the Nazis and dumped into a 
pit with hundreds of other bodies. Although their two children were lost in the 
camps, Natasha has returned to life, acerbic as ever, and has emigrated to 
Manhattan's Lower East Side. 
</P>
<P>
One note is common to these survivors: a sense of being dead among the living. 
Even though Herman avoided the camps, the same miasma grips him too; pain at 
the loss of his children possibly complicated by guilt at not having been 
captured. Only Yadwiga is exempt; stubborn and optimistic, she is the film's 
positive spirit. 
</P>
<P>
A man in whose body sensuality and intelligence wage constant civil war, Herman 
tries to keep up with the demands of all three women with relative openness. He 
tells Natasha and Masha, the two most able to cope with the news, of the 
other's existence. The pathologically jealous Masha believes none of it; 
Natasha, sophisticated and unflappable, isn't surprised to learn he has a 
mistress, "What can you talk about with Yadwiga?" she says, sensibly. 
</P>
<P>
The danger, of course, in telling even a snippet of "Enemies' " plot is that 
mentioning Herman's serial wives and sweethearts may make it sound like an 
ethnic "Worth Winning," one of the nastier ideas of the decade. "Enemies" is 
actually dark farce told in carefully detailed character studies, which rely 
entirely on the actors' perfect pitch to keep them airborne. 
</P>
<P>
Well, casting and subtle performance were always Mazursky's long suits, yet 
even for him this cast is exceptional. At first glance, the biting, ironic 
brilliance of Anjelica Huston's Natasha seems to be the film's strongest asset, 
a performance which makes her Academy Award-winning Maerose in "Prizzi's Honor" 
seem anemic by comparison. It still seems to be the film's most informative 
creation: watching her we learn everything about caste, aristocracy and a 
lifelong sense of loss. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is also Lena Olin's mercurial Masha, playful, haunted, at peace 
only in one scene. Masha is an even more adept liar than Herman and certainly 
his equal in sensuality. In her hilarious comic sequence, we see the dimensions 
to Margaret Sophie Stein's gentle, long-suffering Yadwiga, whose strengths 
emerge slowly until she blossoms into someone far more forceful than a put-upon 
house wren. 
</P>
<P>
But then you realize Ron Silver's complex shadings have made Herman the flint 
against which all three women strike fire. His life may be untenable, but if 
for a moment Herman becomes foolish in his moral confusion or if he becomes a 
scurrying wimp, the movie is lost. He never does; there's a deep, pained 
intelligence behind Silver's eyes; if finally, Herman Broder becomes as 
indecisive as Hamlet, he's no less interesting a man. 
</P>
<P>
Swirling around them all is a second ring of characters, most notably the great 
comic-poignance of Judith Malina as Masha's mother, Phil Leeds as the crucial 
Mr. Pesheles, Mazursky as the hateful Leon Tortshiner and the slightly 
debatable theatricality of Alan King as Rabbi Lembeck. 
</P>
<P>
Finally there is the sense of the city itself, conjured up by Mazursky's usual 
team of craftsmen, particularly his veteran production designer Pato Guzman, 
whose crowded apartments or melancholy beachfronts become the story's fifth 
character and his masterly costume designer Albert Wolsky, whose details for 
these 1949 clothes -- crocheted snoods or cross-stitched peasant blouses -- 
deliberately mirror a slightly earlier period that these refugees might still 
cling to. 
</P>
<P>
Cinematographer Fred Baker uses a palette subtle as a hand-tinted postcard, and 
Maurice Jarre's addition of klezmer rhythms to his score gives it just the 
authentic buzz that's needed. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Mazursky who has filled his teeming frame with these indelible faces, 
who sketches the activities at a Catskill resort with such affectionate satire 
and who so clearly understands the knife edge between laughter and tears on 
which Singer constantly balances. And it is Mazursky whose underlining at the 
close of "Enemies, A Love Story" (rated R for its steamy love scenes) gives it 
its soaring sense of continuity and healing.

JAZZ: DESPITE A NEW ALBUM, VETERAN MUSICIAN MOSE ALLISON IS STILL DOING WHAT HE 
DOES BEST: PERFORMING LIVE AT SMALL CLUBS.

Mose Allison lives in Long Island, but he has the laid-back manner of a 
Southern Californian. Nothing seems to knock him from his mellow groove, not 
even the thought that his record company may have let him down. 
</P>
<P>
Allison, who brings his bluesy jazz vocals and piano to Elario's for two weeks 
beginning Wednesday, believes that "Ever Since the World Ended," released 
several months ago, is one of his best albums. But, Allison said, it hasn't 
received the best distribution. 
</P>
<P>
"People tell me they can't find it in the stores," he said by phone from New 
Orleans, where he was recording a new album last week. "I got great reviews. 
I'll probably never get better reviews. But Blue Note evidently doesn't want to 
push it." 
</P>
<P>
During a career about to enter its fifth decade, one of Allison's best-selling 
albums was one of his first, the late-'50s "Mose Allison Sings," reissued in 
the '60s as "The Seventh Son." 
</P>
<P>
"It's my earliest songs," Allison said. "I feel like I'm better now." 
</P>
<P>
Not that he's ever counted on his recording career. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't make my living from records, I make it from playing clubs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Allison doesn't spend much time agonizing over album sales. He's too busy 
searching for fresh music. 
</P>
<P>
For the new album, Allison wrote nine songs and chose three somewhat offbeat 
tunes by other writers, including the satirical "You Call it Jogging," by 
Tennessee songwriter John D. Loudermilk. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes, 'You call it jogging, but I call it running around,' " Allison said, 
reciting the opening line. "My songs are in my usual groove. Some are 
satirical, some are ironic. Some have a little political context. 'The Long 
Song' is a satire on songwriting. 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' has to do with the 
conflict everyone faces." 
</P>
<P>
Another song is "Am I Trying to Serve the Human Race, or Am I Just Along for 
the Ride?" 
</P>
<P>
Answering for himself, Allison explained, "My art is my service. I put all my 
energy into that." 
</P>
<P>
Backing him up on the new album are four New Orleans musicians he's never used 
in the studio before. A few of the songs capture some of the flavor of 
traditional New Orleans jazz, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On stage, Allison has also been trying some different combinations. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, he played the Beacon Theater in New York City with pop-rock 
singers Van Morrison and Georgie Fame, at the singers' request. 
</P>
<P>
"I've opened shows for Van, but this is the first time I ever did something 
with them. Van is a great, talented guy. I did three of my own songs, and they 
sang parts of them with me." 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Allison played a week at Fat Tuesday's in New York City, his 
favorite spot to work when he's home in Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
He feels his playing and singing have never been stronger. 
</P>
<P>
"With my voice, I've got better control now than ever before," he said. "I know 
more about it." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he's picked up pointers from unlikely sources. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard Robert Merrill, the famous Metropolitan Opera baritone, on TV one day 
talking about the proper technique of singing. He talked about the idea of the 
mask, how you let your face be impassive, you don't grimace, don't strain. This 
gives you better control over your breathing, it lets your sinuses resonate." 
</P>
<P>
Besides technique, Allison, 62, believes physical conditioning is a key to 
vocal power. Even when he's traveling, he tries to run a mile or two or swim a 
few times a week. 
</P>
<P>
As for his piano playing, Allison said, "Every night I try to do something 
different. I still consider myself a jazz pianist." 
</P>
<P>
Though he is best known to jazz fans for his seasoned voice, which influenced a 
whole generation of singers including Fame and Michael Franks, Allison is also 
a top-notch pianist. 
</P>
<P>
In the '50s, he played in rhythm sections behind such jazz greats as Stan Getz, 
Gerry Mulligan, Al Cohn and Zoot Sims. He counts Duke Ellington, Thelonius Monk 
and Dizzy Gillespie among his favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he has developed his own voice on piano, an aggressive attack 
which, with its percussive chording and relentless right-hand melodic 
inventions, calls to mind McCoy Tyner. 
</P>
<P>
At Elario's, Allison will be backed by San Diegans Gunnar Biggs on bass, Gary 
Lefebvre on sax and Bob Weller on drums. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at Elario's was the first time Allison worked with Lefebvre. Both 
musicians played with Chet Baker in the '50s, and Lefebvre's sensuous, melodic 
sound makes an excellent foil for Allison's deceptively relaxed vocals and 
quirky piano. 
</P>
<P>
Allison makes his music look easy, but Lefebvre can vouch for its complexities. 
</P>
<P>
"His music is different than anything I've ever played. He has his own style. 
It's challenging. You have to stay on top of things. The songs can be complex, 
and they go in unexpected directions." 
</P>
<P>
 KPBS-TV's (Channel 15) "Club Date" jazz program will feature Allison on 
Thursday at 10:30 p.m. and again Dec. 22, at 5:30 p.m.

TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF 'CHAOS' IN MANAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do you do if you're a fabulously wealthy author looking for new horizons 
to conquer? 
</P>
<P>
Well, if you're Tom Peters, author of "In Search of Excellence" and other 
best-sellers, you become a one-man TV gang, producing and hosting specials 
that, oddly enough, feature the ideas in your latest book. "Thriving on Chaos: 
Handbook for a Management Revolution," airing tonight at 10 on Channel 28, is 
Peters' latest PBS venture. And, like last season's "Excellence in the Public 
Sector," "Chaos" is an entertaining if uneven mix. 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, "Chaos" is a showcase for Peters, a whirl of energy who 
comes across as the Robin Leach of marketing. Peters is the star of this 
freewheeling celebration of the power of information technology -- he works a 
Dallas audience, the framework of the show, like Oprah Winfrey facing down a 
group of Harvard MBAs, setting up interview segments and visits to innovative 
companies. He gets laughs -- and he makes his points. 
</P>
<P>
The main points: 
</P>
<P>
* The business world is moving at warp speed, benefitting those who are 
constantly improving and changing. 
</P>
<P>
* The information revolution is powering this dramatic change, enabling even 
tiny companies to compete with and win against Fortune 500 behemoths. 
</P>
<P>
* Those who don't join in will be left in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
"Chaos" profiles some of the winners, including an advertising group that uses 
computer disks as a sales tool, pioneering a new form of marketing; and a 
clothing retailer who has shrunk its ordering cycle from nine weeks to three 
days, enabling it to cut inventory substantially while ensuring that every item 
is always in stock. 
</P>
<P>
Even with Peters' hoopla, "Chaos" ultimately is thought provoking -- a show 
with ideas worth examining. It is Part 1 of a three-part series by Peters' 
company. Other segments are scheduled for next Tuesday and Dec. 26.

HEADSETS FOR KIDS STRIKE A SOUR NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 23 million headset radios and tape players are sold in the United States 
every year, and a look at toy store racks confirms that there's a new target 
audience for them: the grade-school crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Painted in bold primary colors or cute pinks and purples, the personal stereos 
range from sturdily built $50 models to bare-basics versions obtainable for 
less than $10. What they all have in common is the ability to create sound so 
loud it can cause an insidious, cumulative hearing loss. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown sound levels from the machines can reach 115 decibels or 
more. At that level, permanent hearing damage could occur after just 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that there are a lot of kids who get an awful lot of hearing damage 
because I'm sure that they never use the headset at 15 minutes a day, but a 
great deal more than that," said Dr. Jack Vernon, otolaryngology professor at 
Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Noise-induced hearing loss is cumulative and is a function of sound intensity 
and duration. So listening to even moderately loud music for longer than 15 
minutes or listening day after day can cause permanent damage. 
</P>
<P>
And the earlier a child begins using a headset to listen to loud music, the 
more years over which damage can accumulate. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, parents need to be careful about supervising their children's use 
of these powerful little sound machines, hearing experts say. 
</P>
<P>
But that is easier said than done because, unlike other situations where young 
people encounter loud music, headset use is less likely to provide clues that 
the sound is too loud. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a teen-ager who has just attended a rock concert may experience 
muffled hearing or ringing in the ears, clear signals that the sound was too 
loud. Such symptoms -- although they often disappear after a few days -- mean 
some permanent hearing loss has occurred at high sound frequencies, many 
experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
And a child who turns up the volume on his bedroom stereo too high will soon 
have angry parents at his door, which can guard against damage. 
</P>
<P>
But a headphone-wearing child is difficult for a parent to monitor. As a rule 
of thumb, experts say, headset sound that is loud enough to be heard by 
passers-by can cause damage if used more than two hours a day. However, 
individuals can be more sensitive than that to damage. 
</P>
<P>
Record producer Jeff Baxter is serving as a celebrity spokesman for the 
"Hearing Is Priceless" education campaign of the House Ear Institute of Los 
Angeles. When talking to teen-agers about saving their hearing, he uses 
analogies he thinks young people will understand. 
</P>
<P>
"You like to swim . . . you like to be in the water, but you're not interested 
in drowning," he tells them. "So why would you fill your ears with debilitating 
sound when what you really want to do is feel the music with your body?" 
</P>
<P>
Baxter was noted for blocking out the booming sound of on-stage amplifiers with 
an earmuff-style headset when he was a guitarist in the 1970s with the rock 
groups Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers. He credits this with maintaining his 
hearing so that he is able to produce records today. 
</P>
<P>
He says young people can enjoy the experience of being surrounded by sound at a 
very loud concert but still protect their hearing by wearing foam earplugs. 
These let sound pass through but cut down on the volume. 
</P>
<P>
At clinics such as the one associated with the House Ear Institute, it is 
common to see young men in their 30s who have constant ringing in their ears, 
called tinnitus, or who are having trouble understanding speech because of 
hearing damage from rock concerts two decades earlier. 
</P>
<P>
If a similar phenomenon occurs with headset use -- which has enjoyed its boom 
only since the early '80s -- hearing specialists don't expect it to emerge for 
another decade. 
</P>
<P>
One of the early studies on headset effects was conducted in 1984 at the 
University of Iowa. Researchers asked 16 headset-stereo owners to listen to 
music for three hours at the loudness setting they normally used. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that the nine volunteers who listened to music at an average of 
90 decibels -- equivalent to noise from a vacuum cleaner -- showed little or no 
hearing loss. 
</P>
<P>
But the seven subjects who listened at 94 to 104 decibels -- roughly equivalent 
to the noise from a blender at the low end and a chain saw at the high end -- 
temporarily lost an average of 10 decibels of hearing at high frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
With a permanent hearing loss of this degree, conversational speech would have 
to be 10 decibels louder for the person to hear the difference between "feet" 
and "heat." That is because consonant sounds are of higher audio frequency than 
vowels, and high-frequency hearing is the first to be damaged by noise. (A 
voice in normal conversation is about 60 decibels.) 
</P>
<P>
Further, the study found that the person who listened to 104-decibel music lost 
25 decibels of hearing in one ear and 35 decibels in the other. 
</P>
<P>
All the hearing losses had disappeared within 24 hours, but the researchers 
worried about the ability of the ear to stand up to repeated onslaughts, since 
the volunteers admitted using headsets up to six hours per day. 
</P>
<P>
Another study, at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, found that of 89 
college students who used headset stereos, a third listened at levels louder 
than is considered safe under federal standards for industrial workers. 
</P>
<P>
Those standards limit exposure to noise of 100 decibels to no more than two 
hours per day. The allowable time is halved for every five decibels above that; 
at 105 decibels, for example, the maximum is one hour. 
</P>
<P>
When noise-induced hearing loss does occur, it is because of damage to the 
15,000 "hair cells" in the inner ear. Sound vibrations are transmitted 
mechanically through the outer and middle ear, then converted to electrical 
impulses by hair cells. The signal travels through the auditory nerve to the 
brain for interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
Loud noise causes hearing loss by making hair cells die or become stiff and 
brittle. They are never replaced. This process occurs slowly with normal aging 
but is accelerated by noise damage. 
</P>
<P>
Speech and music send discernible sound up to about 8,000 hertz -- a measure of 
sound-wave cycles per second -- to the inner ear. It isn't until a hearing loss 
occurs in the 3,000-hertz range that discerning speech becomes difficult, said 
Janet Endo, an audiologist at the House Ear Clinic in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 21 million Americans who have a hearing loss in one or 
both ears. Problems coping with the hearing world often can lead to social 
isolation. Although technology has provided better hearing aids and even 
implantable devices, they are not as good as natural hearing, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Noise damage is more insidious in young children than in adults because their 
hair cells have not yet been affected by the normal aging process, Oregon's 
Vernon said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, their noise-induced hearing losses would come first at very high 
frequencies that are not even included in normal audiology tests. Test 
equipment stops at about 8,000 hertz, but young children are sensitive to 
frequencies up to 20,000 hertz, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only would this early noise-induced loss accelerate the normal aging 
process of the hearing apparatus, he said, but it also is known that, once a 
noise-related loss occurs, an individual becomes more sensitive to further 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
After the early research into headset stereos' effect on hearing, manufacturers 
responded by putting warnings on their packaging. Many also include a pamphlet 
from the Electronic Industries Assn. exhorting users to "use your head when you 
use your headset." 
</P>
<P>
Koss Corp. of Milwaukee earned praise from audiologists by marketing a unit for 
children that had a warning light when sound was turned up too loud. Koss has 
since stopped making stereo units. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, however, headset stereos now being marketed for children -- 
particularly the less expensive ones -- have no such features. 
</P>
<P>
The exceptions are two bright red models in the My First Sony line sold by the 
Sony Corp. They feature a limiter switch that lowers the maximum amount of 
sound the unit can produce. However, the switch is easy for a child to flip 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Marnix Van Gemert, president of Sony's personal audio products division in the 
United States, said a parent can nonetheless monitor the child to see that the 
switch is being used. He also noted that the My First Sony line has radios and 
cassette players without headphones, which the parent might prefer. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Gallea, an audio test engineer for Consumers Union, suggests the ideal 
goal would be for manufacturers to develop internal circuitry to automatically 
dampen sound when it exceeded dangerous levels. 
</P>
<P>
This feature would have to be intelligent enough to allow short bursts of loud 
sound, such as when a cymbal is struck, or consumers would never accept it, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to be able to pass through enough of a dynamic range so that you're 
not losing the peaks in the music," Gallea said. "It has to be fairly benign so 
that it doesn't cause damage to the music." 
</P>
<P>
Given that such technology is not on the horizon, and given that the Electronic 
Industries Assn. expects 23.6 million headset stereos to be sold in 1991, it is 
up to parents to figure out how to protect their children's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John House, president of the House Ear Institute, has solved the problem in 
his home by encouraging his three sons, ages 11 to 18, to play their music on 
regular audio units. 
</P>
<P>
"I discourage them from using headsets because it's hard to have control over 
what the volume is -- unless you can hear it clear across the room, then 
obviously that's too loud," House said. 
</P>
<P>
But because some children simply must have headset stereos, experts devised a 
variety of home tests to determine the maximum safe loudness. 
</P>
<P>
Tests of various brands at the House Ear Institute indicate that anything above 
the "5" setting on a 1-to-10 volume control is the maximum anyone should use, 
House said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mount Sinai study, which tested three models marketed in 1984 by Sony, 
Toshiba and Sanyo, found that a "5" averaged 94 decibels. The federal 
government's occupational standards say that level of sound is dangerous if 
experienced for more than four hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Every manufacturer has different loudness scales, however, so the setting 
offers only rough estimates. Headset audio also is difficult to gauge because 
the listener becomes accustomed to it and because environmental noise will 
cause a listener to turn the sound up to block the other sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gallea of Consumers Union suggests this test: 
</P>
<P>
Play music on a conventional audio system at a level that allows you to carry 
on a conversation without shouting. Then switch the room audio off and the 
headset unit on with a similar kind of music. 
</P>
<P>
Compare the sound levels between the two until the headset audio sounds no 
louder than the room unit does. Note the number on the volume level control of 
your headset unit. That is the maximum sound level at which you can safely use 
the player -- even if traffic or other environmental noise tempts you to turn 
it up. 
</P>
<P>
Once the maximum safe level is determined, Oregon's Vernon advises finding a 
way to alter the volume dial so it cannot be turned beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
This advice applies to adults as well as children, the experts noted. 
</P>
<P>
It also applies to any kind of music, not just the rock music that children and 
teen-agers tend to prefer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE DAMAGE WITHIN 
</P>
<P>
Sounds higher than 80 decibels -- a little louder than an alarm clock -- can 
damage the inner ear's hair cells, which convert sound vibrations into 
electrical signals that the brain can interpret. Often, the damage is 
temporary. But if prolonged noise destroys the hair cell, it does not 
regenerate. 
</P>
<P>
Cranked up, a headset stereo can produce sound at around 115 decibels, the 
level at which hair cell damage can be expected after just 15 minutes.

Garage Sale Soon: When a Minnesota newspaper published a purported inventory of 
the governor's mansion -- including 156 chairs, six television sets and 26 
sofas -- a miffed Gov. Rudy Perpich and his wife, Lola, responded by proposing 
the state sell off the place. In a huff at what she called criticism of her 
family's life style, Lola Perpich said that she and the governor will ask the 
1990 Legislature to sell the mansion and its contents and donate the proceeds 
to help the homeless. The state attorney general's office will determine if a 
sale of the 1910 mansion is possible.

Queen of the Bile: Today's the big day for hotel queen Leona Helmsley. U.S. 
Dist. Judge John M. Walker Jr. will decide whether the dust-busting innkeeper 
will exchange her designer clothes for a prison uniform. Convicted Aug. 30 of 
evading $1.2 million in federal taxes, the 69-year-old Helmsley could get up to

Helmets On: Gary Busey, recovering from the head injury he suffered in a 
motorcycle accident, has changed his mind and now advocates the use of helmets. 
"Next time you're doing 45 miles per hour, look at the curb and think about 
slam-dancing with it once, and you'll start thinking about helmets," Busey said 
on the "Arsenio Hall Show." He was not wearing a helmet when his motorcycle 
struck a Culver City curb, and in the months after the accident, he insisted on 
his right not to wear head protection.

Animal Cracker: "Santa Paws" Bill Stovall wore flea-and-tick powder in his red

climb into Santa's lap and ask for a Christmas bone. "I've never had a pet that 
is obnoxious, but every once in a while you get a kid that is," Stovall said.

The Improbable Machine: What the Upheavals in Artificial Intelligence Research 
Reveal About How the Mind Really Works by Jeremy Campbell (Simon and Schuster: 
$19.95; 334 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The subtitle of this wonderful book says it all: "What the upheavals (read: 
failures) in artificial intelligence research reveal about how the mind really 
works." Computers are logic machines. But people don't think that way. That's 
why all efforts to get computers to think have failed. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Campbell, a science writer of imagination and skill, here puts to rout 
the notion that reason -- logic -- is how we decide things. It is not. There is 
substantial experimental evidence in cognitive science that shows that the way 
we think is very dependent on what we're thinking about. 
</P>
<P>
"Humans are not general-purpose logicians," Campbell writes. "What they know 
has a powerful effect on how they think. Something as seemingly serene and 
detached as reason turns out to be intimately entangled with the business of 
being and acting in the world . . . What gives logic its tremendous power -- 
its indifference to content -- is not what gives natural intelligence its 
power." 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the difference between brains and machines. Logic -- the 
step-by-step method of Euclid -- works well only in highly formalized 
situations where the facts are complete and clean. But that is not the 
real-world situation at all. 
</P>
<P>
In the real world, we have mind sets, belief systems, biases which enable us to 
fill in the gaps and make sense of the information that constantly flows into 
our senses by the bushel. In most cases, we don't reason things out 
step-by-step. Our perceptions and our conclusions occur simultaneously. We 
recognize our aunt in a flash, even if she's changed her hairdo or is a wearing 
a new hat (something computers can't do). 
</P>
<P>
"The serial computer is most at home in a world very unlike our own, a world of 
well-defined puzzles having clear solutions, exhaustive descriptions, lists, 
explicit rules, literal meanings, perfect information," Campbell writes in his 
introduction to "The Improbable Machine." 
</P>
<P>
"The world in which the brain evolved is a great deal more untidy and less 
circumscribed, full of ambiguity, deceit, problems that sprawl in ungainly 
fashion and have no firm boundaries, words with multiple meanings, faces that 
send enigmatic messages, information that is incomplete or contradictory, 
answers that breed endless families of further questions." 
</P>
<P>
This book is more about the brain and how it thinks than about computers and 
why they don't, though Campbell makes clear that many computer scientists have 
turned to "connectionism" -- neural networks -- in an effort to simulate how 
the brain actually works. 
</P>
<P>
But his focus is on the brain and the far-reaching implications of the 
realization that our thought processes are anything but logical. The need to 
get along in the world has made brains very pragmatic. It forced our ancestors 
and forces us to invent structures -- "schema," Campbell calls them -- for 
interpreting sense data. 
</P>
<P>
Once those structures are in place, it is very hard to dislodge them by 
argument, reason, facts, logic or any "rational" device. We overvalue evidence 
that supports our world view and explain away or dismiss evidence that 
contradicts it. Liberals never persuade conservatives, and conservatives never 
persuade liberals. 
</P>
<P>
Our brains have a need to explain things, and they resist the notion that some 
things cannot be explained. Campbell knows, for example, that the newspaper 
articles that appear every day purporting to explain the stock market's 
activity the day before are bunk. 
</P>
<P>
"Explanations are a means of bringing an uncertain world under control," he 
writes. "They make random events seem to reveal a hidden, rational order, and 
tame the wild beasts of mere chance. Every day, experts on the stock market 
come up with at least one plausible explanation of why the index went up or 
down the previous day, with definite causes neatly producing logical effects. 
Yet if there is an underlying order to the gyrations of the stock market, 
economists have been unable to discover it." 
</P>
<P>
And that's just the start of it. We make up "good stories" about the world, 
Campbell says, and they "ride roughshod over the principles of logic and the 
laws of probability, immunizing the mind against surprise, and consequently 
blocking the path to wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
I cannot praise this book enough. It draws on a wide and fascinating array of 
sources to show how illogical we really are, and it cuts through the 
gobbledygook that usually passes for discourse. 
</P>
<P>
It is ostensibly about the mind, which is embodied in the brain, but it is 
really about how we know. As a result, it has implications in every area of 
knowledge and thought, which includes quite a lot.

ERMA BOMBECK: MICROPHONE IS ON; LET THE CONFESSIONS BEGIN

<TEXT>
<P>
Remember all the dirty laundry we were never supposed to air in public? Well, 
it's now being hung out to dry on television by Phil, Oprah, Sally, Jessy, 
Maury and Geraldo. 
</P>
<P>
I've never seen so many people spilling their guts to Chuck Woolery and Barbara 
Walters in my life. Not just little bits of family trivia, but deep emotional 
scars . . . repressed hostility . . . dark family secrets that you wouldn't 
tell a psychiatrist if he or she paid you. 
</P>
<P>
I was watching a couple the other day lay bare her frigidity and his impotence 
and couldn't help reflecting how far we have come. 
</P>
<P>
Was it only a few years ago that Bob Eubanks asked a couple on "The Newlywed 
Game" which way they were facing when they "made whoopee" -- the Arctic Circle, 
South America or Ohio? And the audience gasped? 
</P>
<P>
Hookers want to tell us why they love their work, nuns why they left the order, 
fathers why they abused their children, black women what they feel about their 
husbands having white mistresses, and children how satanic cults tear their 
families apart. 
</P>
<P>
I watched a woman in a talk show audience the other day verbally assault a 
guest with, "I knew from the moment you walked in here you were a shiftless, 
no-good slime bucket who was stupid and should be put away somewhere." They had 
never met until that moment. The audience cheered. 
</P>
<P>
Why are people so eager to dump their feelings on talk shows like bellhops 
hustling luggage with bad backs? Many of them are out of control, on an 
emotional slalom that leaves them in a teary heap at the end of the show. 
</P>
<P>
It has to be something simple like the appearance of a microphone. When you put 
one in front of people or attach it to them, they fall under a spell. It isn't 
real anymore. They will tell you anything. 
</P>
<P>
After 11 years on TV, I never got over the shock of taping a microphone on the 
guest's underwear (someone I had never met before) and watching the 
metamorphosis take place. 
</P>
<P>
Got a problem with your husband, your kids, your boss or your mother? Forget 
Joan Rivers and Judge Wapner. Just sit down with them under a bright light, 
clip on a microphone and hammer it out.

BULGARIANS GET PARTY PLEDGE OF FREE ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SOFIA, Bulgaria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Communist Party leader of Bulgaria on Monday promised free elections by 
June and an end to the party's automatic right to rule. 
</P>
<P>
"We propose that the National Assembly organize new, free democratic elections 
by the end of May," Petar Mladenov told a meeting of the party's 
decision-making Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov also said the party's guaranteed dominance of Bulgarian society is 
being scrapped. "The leading role of the party cannot be declared 
administratively," he said, "but must come from the trust of the people." 
</P>
<P>
A Communist Party spokesman told a news conference that the party is proposing 
to the National Assembly that the article of the constitution guaranteeing the 
party's monopoly on power be scrapped and a new constitution drawn up by the 
end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov's announcement comes in the wake of similar moves by the East German 
and Czechoslovak parties to surrender their absolute grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
It followed a four-week whirlwind of political change in this Balkan country of 
9 million, culminating in a pro-democracy rally Sunday in Sofia that drew tens 
of thousands of people to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov, a former foreign minister who took over from veteran hard-liner Todor 
Zhivkov last month, also proposed a dialogue "with all powers of society which 
work on the basis of socialism and patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
But it was not immediately clear if this dialogue would involve opposition 
groups, which have demanded talks with the ruling party on the future of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Free elections as early as May in this country -- which until a few weeks ago 
was a fortress of Stalinism -- are likely to favor the Communists. The growing 
number of still-unregistered political, religious and ecological groups were 
banned until recently and have had little time to establish themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A Sofia court Monday registered Eco-Glasnost, an environmentalist group, as 
Bulgaria's first officially independent organization. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov, whose speech to the policy-making Central Committee was carried by 
Bulgarian Radio, said the party will also hold an extraordinary congress of 
grass-roots members next March. The congress is the body that could elect a new 
Central Committee, and the prevailing belief is that a more reformist Central 
Committee would result. Until Mladenov's speech, the party congress had been 
scheduled for late next year. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov also proposed that Parliament vote this week to set up a commission to 
investigate charges of corruption during the 35-year rule of the now-disgraced 
Zhivkov. 
</P>
<P>
As the Central Committee meeting continued in closed session, 12,000 Bulgarians 
massed in freezing darkness near party headquarters to hold a silent 
candlelight vigil in support of opposition demands for further political 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are not satisfied with what the party has done until now," a 
dissident priest, Father Hristofor Sabev, told a reporter. "People want general 
change, not just lies." 
</P>
<P>
In a gesture of anger, those in the crowd raised their candles in the direction 
of a giant red star atop the party building. Police did not intervene, and the 
crowd dispersed peacefully after one hour. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's rally, organized by 19 independent groups, was the largest public show 
of skepticism about Mladenov's commitment to reform since he ousted Zhivkov. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mladenov has purged many of Zhivkov's hard-line allies from top party 
posts and brought unprecedented openness to the state-controlled media, many 
Bulgarians have said the changes are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
Those who turned out Sunday voted to support opposition demands for the 
resignation of the entire Central Committee, an end to the party's guaranteed 
monopoly on power and immediate round-table talks. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial trade union leader Konstantin Trenchev, speaking before Mladenov 
announced the political changes Monday, said he could not rule out the 
possibility of a general strike. 
</P>
<P>
"People expect changes, and if they don't happen, a strike could be possible in 
the coming months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rabotnichesko Delo, the party's daily newspaper, reported that more than 4,000 
letters and telephone calls demanding reforms have been received since Zhivkov 
was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll ordered by the Central Committee and published by the paper 
said that only 23% of those responding expressed great trust in the party and 
only 32% indicated trust in any political organization. 
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that one-third of those polled said they wanted a 
multi-party political system, 68.9% supported a system based on law and 77.7% 
said economic reform was imperative.

SPIEGEL TO QUIT COLUMBIA S &amp; L AMID GROWING LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Spiegel, a maverick who built Columbia Savings &amp; Loan into one of 
the nation's most controversial thrifts by using federally insured deposits to 
buy high-risk junk bonds, announced Monday that he will resign Dec. 31 as head 
of the Beverly Hills institution. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Spiegel, 43, who will remain a Columbia consultant, comes at 
a tumultuous time for the thrift. After years of posting big profits from its 
junk bonds and other high-yield investments, it is now showing huge losses as 
the value of its $3.8-billion portfolio tumbles. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, junk bonds have fallen sharply in price as investors have 
grown nervous about their safety, sparked in part by problems at some companies 
that issued them and fears of a recession. In addition, new federal thrift 
rules, enacted to rein in non-traditional thrift investments, require Columbia 
to sell its bonds by 1994, and devalue those bonds on its books to reflect the 
depressed values they are selling for lately. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds are financial instruments issued by companies with low credit 
ratings. They pay holders a higher yield, above 12% in recent years, to 
compensate for the added risk. As of Nov. 30, Columbia's unrealized losses on 
its high-yield investments -- largely the difference between what Columbia paid 
for the junk bonds and what investors are willing to pay for them on the open 
market -- was a staggering $744 million, according to Columbia executives. 
About $100 million of that amount came in November alone, the executives said. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia so far has set aside about $300 million as a cushion against those 
losses. In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Columbia posted a $226.3-million 
loss. Its stock has plunged from nearly $12 a share this spring to close at 
$2.75 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Spiegel cited the rapid deterioration of the junk-bond market 
as prompting his resignation as chairman, chief executive, president and a 
director. He also cited "the publicity surrounding me," an indirect reference 
to the attention given his business and personal ties to indicted financier 
Michael R. Milken. Columbia and Spiegel's father, Abraham, who founded the 
thrift, also have been publicly linked to the investigation of Mayor Tom 
Bradley's financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk-bond executive, is awaiting 
trial in federal court in New York on securities fraud and racketeering 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel, who with his family owns more than half of Columbia's stock, built a 
profitable thrift largely by using funds gathered by Wall Street "money 
brokers" -- people who invest money in savings and loan accounts that offer 
high yields. He offered attractive rates to those money brokers, then locked in 
a profit by buying lucrative junk bonds from Milken's clients that paid a 
higher yield than he was paying out for deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel, in the announcement, said he plans to work with investment bankers at 
First Boston Corp. to form an "entity" for the junk bonds. Most likely, 
Columbia's junk bonds would be spun off somehow to a separate company, trust or 
partnership, and Columbia would continue to reap some profits from the bonds by 
holding a stake in the firm and providing loans to it. 
</P>
<P>
Acquaintances of Spiegel said they are not surprised that he would want to head 
a junk bond operation and even leave the chief executive's job, since he 
clearly is more interested in investing than he is in running a traditional 
thrift. But without access to those federally insured deposits and with 
Milken's future clouded, they said, it would be more difficult for him to work 
his magic as he did at Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with Columbia said that Spiegel probably will run the operation. 
It most likely will attract money from institutional investors such as pension 
funds and insurance companies by issuing securities backed by the junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel acquaintances said the timing of his leaving is curious because no 
successor has been found. Columbia named Kenneth R. Heitz, Columbia's principal 
lawyer, to fill in for him, adding that candidates are being screened by an 
executive search firm. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift industry executives who know Spiegel speculated that he may be leaving 
in anticipation of an embarrassing disclosure, possibly related to the Milken 
case. Columbia investments and trades have been under investigation by federal 
prosecutors, and Columbia records have been subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
Heitz said, however, that neither Columbia nor Spiegel has received a so-called 
"target letter" -- one sent by prosecutors when an indictment is imminent. He 
added that prosecutors have told him that neither Spiegel nor the thrift will 
be named in an expanded indictment expected soon in the Milken case. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia, although not Thomas Spiegel personally, has been linked to Bradley in 
the ongoing investigation into the mayor's finances. Spiegel's father, Abraham, 
is a longtime personal friend, traveling companion and political contributor to 
Bradley who has advised the mayor on his investments. Also, an embarrassing 
loan and junk-bond investment made to former Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced) 
through Thomas Spiegel also helped prompt Coelho's resignation earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's biggest problems are maintaining adequate capital -- the financial 
cushion against losses -- in the wake of its deteriorating junk bond values and 
finding a replacement for Spiegel quickly. In its announcement Monday, however, 
Columbia confirmed that it failed to meet one of three new capital standards 
that took effect effect Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The standard it flunked is called a "risk-based" measurement -- a measure 
computed by weighing the riskiness of a thrift's investments. As a result, 
Columbia will have to file a plan with regulators within a month showing how it 
will come into compliance with standards. Columbia said regulators had no 
influence over Spiegel's decision to resign, and that it was voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Columbia has been among the best capitalized thrifts in the 
nation. One of its advertising campaigns touted it as the best managed major 
thrift in the country, based on ratings published in Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
As previously reported, Columbia also is involved in an accounting dispute with 
federal regulators from the Office of Thrift Supervision over whether it can 
count money set aside for unspecificed losses on its junk bond investments as 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
Heitz said that despite its problems with the junk bond market, Columbia will 
be able to meet the new capital standards after its restructuring is finished. 
He noted that the thrift has sold nearly all of its $3.5-billion portfolio of 
mortgage-backed securities -- packages of mortgages that investors buy -- for a 
gain of nearly $90 million and sold public and private stock for another gain 
of $75 million.

HEART VALVES THE FDA BANNED AS RISKY WERE LEGALLY SOLD ABROAD. THE MEDICAL 
INDUSTRY ARGUES THE U.S. SHOULDN'T IMPOSE ITS REGULATIONS ON OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every time her heart beats, Constance A. Cooper hears the tiny clicks of two 
mechanical valves implanted there. Every time she hears those clicks, she fears 
it will be the last. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no moment when you don't hear those clicks, no night when you go to 
bed without thinking about it," Cooper said. "You wake up every night and you 
just want to hear those clicks perfectly. You just hope you're going to wake up 
in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's fear is well-grounded: At least 246 people worldwide have died 
following fractures of similar heart valves. So she filed a civil lawsuit last 
year in Los Angeles against the manufacturer, Shiley Inc. of Irvine, a 
subsidiary of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was settled Monday when Shiley paid Cooper an undisclosed sum. The 
company had settled many lawsuits involving broken valves, but this was the 
first time that Shiley has settled a suit involving a valve that had not 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
But Connie Cooper's situation is special, even in the deadly annals of the 
Shiley heart valves. Her case has contributed to charges that the federal Food 
and Drug Administration is doing an inadequate job of protecting the public, 
and it has raised questions about whether the United States should impose its 
generally strict standards on foreign customers of U.S. pharmaceutical 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old Cooper is Canadian, and one of the valves in her heart was 
among 4,000 implanted in foreigners after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
prohibited Shiley from selling the device in this country but allowed its 
export to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that the law that permitted Shiley to export its 70-degree heart 
valve -- a measure of the valve's opening -- creates a double standard. 
Although medical devices sold here must undergo rigorous clinical testing, even 
the most critical products may be exported without tests. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
A congressional subcommittee, chaired by the influential Rep. John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.), has tentatively scheduled a hearing for February or March to explore 
the FDA's regulation of Shiley's heart valves and whether tighter export rules 
are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a double standard that will, over time, come back to haunt us, as it did 
with the 70-degree valve," said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Ralph Nader's 
Public Citizen Health Research Group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The medical-device industry, which will sell an estimated $4.3-billion worth of 
products abroad this year, responds that the United States should not impose 
its standards on other nations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a recognition that all countries have their own standards by which 
they regulate anything, whether it is food and drug products, airline safety or 
automobile driving," said Stephen D. Terman, an attorney with the Health 
Industry Manufacturers Assn., the industry trade group in Washington. "The fact 
that a product is not up to the standards of one country should not deprive 
another country of a product if its standards are different." 
</P>
<P>
Shiley declined to comment on the Cooper case, but company spokesman Robert J. 
Fauteux issued the following statement concerning export of the 70-degree 
valve: 
</P>
<P>
"Valves were exported to modern, industrialized countries with sophisticated 
health care systems and individual regulations and customs. Shiley made every 
effort and believes it successfully complied with the responsibilities imposed 
upon it by each foreign country which authorized Shiley to import the 70-degree 
. . . valve." 
</P>
<P>
The congressional inquiry into export regulations and the Shiley heart valve is 
one of several problems now confronting the FDA, which is responsible for 
ensuring the safety of drugs, foods and cosmetics as well as medical devices. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, the agency's staff has been cut from 8,000 to about 7,500 
and the FDA has been beset by criticism that its regulation has broken down. 
Frank E. Young resigned as the commissioner last month as a result of the 
agency's troubles, symbolized by the convictions of three agency officials in 
an unfolding scandal over the cozy relationship between the FDA and generic 
drug makers. 
</P>
<P>
Monitoring Faulted 
</P>
<P>
The chief of the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, 
warned last month that inadequate monitoring of medical devices by the FDA is 
endangering the American public. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the large number of devices that reach the market after 
only a relatively cursory review," Charles A. Bowsher told a House 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the FDA challenged Bowsher's contentions and said the agency 
acts "promptly and aggressively" to protect the public. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA regulates the more than 1,700 types of medical devices available in the 
United States as well as those manufactured here for export. The products 
include almost everything, except drugs, used by health-care professionals to 
diagnose and treat illness. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure the safety and effectiveness of devices sold in the United States, 
the agency requires clinical tests and reviews of devices before they may be 
sold and monitors the performance of devices once they are in general use. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's GAO report criticized both the agency's thoroughness in testing 
and its system for monitoring reports of problems with devices already on the 
market in the United States. The FDA came under similar criticism in the 
mid-1980s for its failure to move faster in urging the removal of Shiley's 
60-degree heart valve from the U.S. market after fractures began to occur. 
</P>
<P>
The number of deaths ultimately attributed to malfunctions of the Shiley valves 
is unknown. The FDA has received reports of 181 deaths involving failures of 
the far more widely distributed 60-degree valve and 65 involving the 70-degree 
version. 
</P>
<P>
But Wolfe estimates that at least 480 persons have died, and an FDA spokeswoman 
acknowledged that there are gaps in the reporting of deaths involving 70-degree 
valves because they have all occurred outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-degree valve was the predecessor to the 70-degree valve, which was never 
sold in the United States. The original valve, called the Bjork-Shiley 
60-degree convexo-concave valve, was developed by the Irvine company and a 
pioneering Swedish heart surgeon, Viking O. Bjork, who now lives in Palm 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA approved the 60-degree valve for sale in the United States in April, 
1979, after clinical tests and a review. It also approved the valve for export, 
and it became the world's most widely used mechanical valve to replace diseased 
or damaged human heart valves. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the 60-degree valves were sold, a small fraction of them began to 
break. When that happened, the heart could no longer pump blood effectively, 
and the consequence was death in two out of every three cases. 
</P>
<P>
Blame quickly focused on the welds that joined two components of the valve 
together, and Bjork later wrote in a medical journal that the welding had 
caused difficulties. Shiley voluntarily recalled various versions and sizes of 
the 60-degree valve in 1980, 1982, 1983 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley told the FDA that it had corrected the problem with each recall. The FDA 
also tolerated the fractures because Shiley had presented data to the agency 
that maintained its valve was better than other types at preventing the 
formation of blood clots, an infrequent but often fatal side effect of 
mechanical heart valves. 
</P>
<P>
According to an analysis by the FDA, the agency later determined that Shiley's 
claims of correcting the fracture problem were "often unfounded" and that the 
valve was no better in reducing clotting than some other types available. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley ended production of the 60-degree valves in 1986 after 81,791 of them 
had been implanted worldwide. The FDA said the valves were subject to a 
"pattern of rare but persistent . . . fractures." 
</P>
<P>
Shiley had developed the 70-degree version in 1980, as an improvement upon the 
60-degree valve. 
</P>
<P>
FDA documents show that Shiley sought approval to sell the 70-degree valve in 
the United States as a variation of the 60-degree valve and a solution to the 
fracture problem. The FDA rejected that request but, in 1980, gave Shiley 
permission to export the 70-degree valve. Shiley shipped 5,600 to 15 countries, 
and 4,000 of them are known to have been used. 
</P>
<P>
The first 70-degree valves were produced by remilling 60-degree valves to 
create a 70-degree opening, according to a study by Swedish surgeons published 
this year and FDA documents. 
</P>
<P>
Problems Developed 
</P>
<P>
The 70-degree valve soon developed its own fracture problems. The most 
failure-prone valves appeared to be a subgroup of 521 large-size 70-degree 
valves that were among those created by remilling 60-degree devices. 
</P>
<P>
The failure rate for this group is more than seven times higher than for the 
60-degree valve or the later versions of the 70-degree, said the study by Bjork 
and two other surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that these remilled valves have "a major risk for 
mechanical failure" from fractures. According to the study, a person with a 
large 70-degree valve has one chance in eight of a valve fracture over a 
seven-year period. 
</P>
<P>
The rate is so high that the surgeons recommended removing the large, remilled 
70-degree valves from some of those who had received them, even though one 
person in 20 dies as a result of replacement surgery. The 60-degree valve's 
fracture rate is lower, and doctors do not recommend its removal. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the high-risk remilled 70-degree valves that was implanted in 
Connie Cooper during five hours of surgery on May 25, 1982, at Toronto General 
Hospital. Cooper, who had had open-heart surgery twice before to replace 
damaged valves, also received a 60-degree Shiley valve at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
She knew nothing then of the standard for exports in the United States, or that 
the 60-degree valve in her heart had been tested clinically but the 70-degree 
valve had not. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt very safe," Cooper recalled in an interview. "My doctor said it was the 
best valve for me and I told him to do whatever he thought was best." 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1976 law, the FDA grants an export certificate for a medical device if 
no negative information about the product exists and the receiving country says 
it has no objection to the device and no law against it. Few countries, 
however, have the evaluation capacity and strict standards of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"Some Western European countries have stricter standards than we do, and some 
Third World countries will take anything," said Terman of the manufacturers 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Officials Confused 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from Dingell's subcommittee found that officials in some 
countries became confused about the significance of an FDA export certificate. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch, for instance, had no standards regulating mechanical heart valves. 
So when Shiley sought Dutch approval to export the 70-degree valve to the 
Netherlands in 1981, the government responded that it had no regulations for 
the devices and therefore no legal objections to importing them, according to a 
government letter obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dutch officials told the congressional investigators recently that 
they had been surprised to learn that the Shiley 70-degree valve was not sold 
in the United States. The Dutch also said that they did not learn the valve had 
been recalled until 1985, two years after the FDA revoked Shiley's export 
license. Even then, the information came not from the FDA but from a newspaper 
article. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 11, 1983, the FDA suspended Shiley's right to export the 70-degree 
valves after reports of five valve fractures in Sweden and two in Australia. 
Five months later, the FDA revoked Shiley's export certificate, and the company 
recalled the valves that had not been implanted. By that time, 4,000 of the 
devices were already in patients, including Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley has been sued more than 200 times in connection with the heart valves. 
According to Wolfe, 50 to 60 of the suits involving broken valves have been 
settled for as much as $1 million. No case has gone to trial and, as part of 
every settlement, Shiley insists that no one disclose the amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning last year, recipients of valves that have not broken began to file 
suits in Orange County against Shiley. The suits claimed that the recipients 
lived in fear of sudden death from a valve fracture and many of those suing are 
foreigners with the 70-degree valve. 
</P>
<P>
According to lawyers who have sued Shiley, the company maintained that it would 
not settle a case in which a valve had not fractured. But that position changed 
with the Cooper case. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper learned of the problems with one of her Shiley valves in March of 1988 
when a doctor at Toronto General told her that the 70-degree valve in her heart 
had a high failure rate. He recommended that she consider surgery to have it 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
But when Cooper explained that she had undergone heart surgery three times and 
one of her natural valves also had a leak, he said she should not be a 
candidate for replacement surgery because her odds of surviving another heart 
operation were too slim. 
</P>
<P>
"You think this can't possibly be true when somebody tells you you are living 
with a time bomb in your heart," said Cooper. "You think, 'My God, how can I 
live with this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Vance C. Simonds Jr. of the Irvine firm of Capretz &amp; Kasdan, 
said Cooper's emotional stress and the fact that she cannot have replacement 
surgery were substantial factors in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"Connie has a long history of medical problems," said Simonds. "This is the 
first man-made problem. She has overcome all the others. This one she can't 
overcome. It will always be with her." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said she thinks of the valve in her heart every day. She often dreams 
that it has broken and she is dying. But she said she has one overriding fear. 
</P>
<P>
"I have two grandchildren and I love baby-sitting for them," she said. "I just 
pray to God that it doesn't happen when I'm baby-sitting the little ones."

TROUBLE BLOWS IN ON 100-M.P.H. SANTA ANAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN and ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chill, dry Santa Ana winds howled down Southern California's mountain passes 
and canyons at up to 100 m.p.h. Monday, toppling trucks, shredding Christmas 
decorations and kicking up dust storms that triggered traffic accidents and 
forced the temporary closure of three freeways. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, power was knocked out to thousands of residential and business 
customers in widely scattered areas, and arcing power lines, downed by the 
hurricane-force gusts, ignited several small brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
The flames were quickly extinguished, but officials said the winds, generated 
by a vast complex of weather systems over the Rockies, were parching the 
already dry Los Angeles Basin, increasing the danger of additional fires. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the wind damage was confined to San Bernardino, Riverside and 
Orange counties Monday morning, forecasters said the Santa Anas should begin 
moving into the Los Angeles area before dawn today. 
</P>
<P>
National Weather Service meteorologists said there will be 45-m.p.h. winds 
early this morning in the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys, with gusts up 
to 60 m.p.h. below some canyons. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, meteorologists from WeatherData Inc., a private firm that 
provides forecasts for The Times, said this morning's winds will be less than 
that -- significantly weaker than Monday's. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest winds reported Monday were gusts of 100 m.p.h. near Grapevine in 
southern Kern County, 85 m.p.h near Devore at the base of the Cajon Pass and 80 
m.p.h. on the hilltops above Point Mugu in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
As is often the case with Santa Anas, communities below the Cajon Pass in the 
San Bernardino area were among the hardest hit Monday, with portions of three 
freeways there closed by opaque clouds of wind-whipped dust and sand. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic is heavy; the visibility is poor and down to zero in some 
stretches," California Highway Patrol Officer Marty Bell reported Monday 
morning from San Bernardino. "It's best to just stay out of the area all 
together if possible." 
</P>
<P>
By noon, at least four big rigs, a number of travel trailers and several 
motorcycles had been tipped over by the heavy winds, most of them on California 
60 and Interstate 15, east of Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
No serious injuries were reported, but one unidentified driver was scraped and 
bruised when the winds toppled his truck. 
</P>
<P>
A CHP officer said the back window of his patrol car was blown out by a strong 
gust. Several motorists took refuge on the lee side of embankments and 
overpasses to wait out the fiercest of the winds. 
</P>
<P>
"It was blowing like mad," said John Anderson, a CHP spokesman in Riverside. 
"And the dust. Whew! What a mess. A lot of people were just waiting out the 
storm." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said one travel trailer was ripped from the pickup truck towing it and 
tossed over the guardrail of an overpass above California 60, east of Ontario. 
He said the driver "probably got to Indio, looked in his rear-view mirror and 
then wondered where that son of a gun was." 
</P>
<P>
California 60 was closed to all traffic between Milliken and Etiwanda avenues 
because of the winds and dust clouds in the Ontario area. Interstate 15 was 
closed from Baseline Road north to the community of Devore. 
</P>
<P>
A section of Interstate 10 near Ontario International Airport also was closed 
for a time, but the airport was able to maintain normal flight operations. 
</P>
<P>
Windblown trash, leaves and small branches torn from trees exacerbated driving 
problems. In some areas, paint and windshields on cars and trucks were 
scratched and pitted by wind-driven pebbles and sand. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was rerouted around the closed freeways onto surface streets. But it 
was slow going throughout the morning, and, police said, the poor visibility 
led to numerous minor fender-benders that compounded the driving problems. 
</P>
<P>
At least 20 trees were uprooted in San Bernardino, and windows were shattered 
in several buildings, including City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoor Christmas decorations took a beating, especially in western San 
Bernardino County, and trees blew over at Christmas tree lots throughout the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
The gusts churned up waves during some unusually high tides along the coast. 
Several stretches of Pacific Coast Highway in Orange County were sporadically 
awash with seawater Monday morning. Forecasters said similar conditions could 
recur today. 
</P>
<P>
Power lines were downed across a broad swath of the Southland, knocking out 
service to at least 16,000 homes and businesses in Orange County and causing 
scattered outages in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. crews were kept busy restoring electrical 
service during the morning. Edison spokesman Steve Nelson said most of the 
outages were momentary, although some areas were without power for considerably 
longer periods. 
</P>
<P>
Downed lines started several small brush fires that were quickly brought under 
control in the Glen Avon area of Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
But fire experts said the low humidity brought by the arid Santa Ana winds was 
drying out the already parched chaparral in the foothills and threatening to 
whip any blazes that started into major firestorms. 
</P>
<P>
"That brush starts to die (after the seasonal rains end) in June, and it 
doesn't start growing again until January," said Gordon Rowley, a U.S. Forest 
Service fire suppression officer based in Arcadia. "By now, with these winds, 
things are extremely dry, with extremely high fire danger." 
</P>
<P>
Rowley said that while its seems to many that there have been more Santa Ana 
winds than usual since Nov. 1, his records show that the area averages 15 to 20 
days of Santa Anas in November and December, and this year is nothing out of 
the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, we've had a lot of heavy winds at this time of year and some 
major fires too," Rowley said. "The potential is there again this year." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's Santa Anas prompted a red flag fire-hazard alert in Orange County, and 
fire officials throughout Southern California urged special caution. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with WeatherData, said the strong winds resulted 
from the interaction of two major weather systems over the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
The first, a cold and vigorous high-level storm system, pulled a strong and 
arid high-pressure system in behind it, he said, generating a chilly stream of 
dry, downslope winds that rapidly invaded Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures and humidity here dropped as the winds rattled into the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Thermometer readings in the chilly mid-40s were common Monday morning, with a 
low at the Los Angeles Civic Center of 47 degrees. The humidity in downtown Los 
Angeles dropped from a high of 86% to a low of just 16%. 
</P>
<P>
National Weather Service meteorologists said they expect the high-pressure 
system to stay in place long enough for a resumption of strong winds before 
dawn that will not ease until sometime this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
WeatherData meteorologists said they expect the high pressure to begin moving 
east a little sooner, with lesser winds, diminishing earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters agreed that today's high temperatures should be mostly in the 70s. 
</P>
<P>
Warren reported from the Riverside-San Bernardino area; Malnic reported from 
Los Angeles. Times staff writers Carol McGraw in Los Angeles and Chris Woodyard 
in Orange County contributed to this story.

ON CALIFORNIA: ALTAMONT: THE DAY THE MUSIC STOPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LIVERMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Altamont had its 20th anniversary last week. If you don't remember what 
happened out here on that cold night in 1969, let me help. This is the place 
where California was supposed to have its own version of Woodstock. And what a 
version it was. 
</P>
<P>
Altamont itself is not easy to find these days. You drive past the Oakland 
hills, then past Livermore and finally take a dirt road to an anonymous cow 
pasture. And there it is. The very spot where, as they say, the '60s died. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there's a lot of places where the '60s supposedly died. You could 
make claims for Kent State, maybe. Or the motel in L.A. where Janis Joplin 
mixed heroin and Southern Comfort for the last time. But Altamont is as good as 
any. 
</P>
<P>
A man named Larry Lacey owns the property now. There's an old speedway next to 
the cow pasture and Lacey is trying to convert it to a motocross track. But the 
county is giving him fits, he can't get the permits, and Lacey blames the 
history of the place. 
</P>
<P>
Altamont is haunted, he says. The local folks have not forgotten the image of 
the Hells Angels wading into the crowd of kids, swinging those pool cues. And 
they don't want any more public events out here. Not now, or ever. 
</P>
<P>
And especially, Lacey says, they don't want anything that has to do with 
motorcycles. You say motorcycle to the locals and they think Hells Angels and 
show up before the county board and say no way is this guy gonna run motocross 
at Altamont. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey shrugs. He'll try again in a few months. Maybe, someday, he says, they 
will forget. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the major events of the '60s, Altamont surely is one of the strangest. 
The notion of a concert at Altamont originated with an offer by the Rolling 
Stones to play free at a site near San Francisco. Very quickly it grew into 
something much larger, nothing less than a re-creation of what was known as 
"Woodstock Nation." 
</P>
<P>
That meant an all-day, all-night festival, a gathering of the tribes without 
any external rules. At Woodstock, hundreds of thousands of flower children had 
indulged themselves in a weekend of drugs and rock 'n' roll without disorder. 
This was seen as proof that America's young generation had grown up peaceful 
and no longer needed antiquarian law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the experience of Woodstock, the plan for Altamont was simple. The 
bands would show up, the kids would show up, and everything would turn out 
fine. Optimism was so high that a documentary film team of David and Albert 
Maysles was hired to record this carrying forward of the Aquarian Age in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
What the Maysles brothers actually captured in their film, "Gimme Shelter," was 
very different. The tribes gathered at Altamont all right, hundreds of 
thousands of kids with their bedrolls and blankets and tinkling bells. They 
came from all over and created a traffic jam 20 miles long. But before the 
music ever began, this crowd revealed that the Aquarian Age had gone on a bad 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
They arrived with eyes glassy from drugs or falling-down drunk. In the film you 
see some of them wallowing on the ground, screaming, while their brothers and 
sisters watch them as if they are crippled bugs. 
</P>
<P>
And when the music begins, so does the fighting. Inexplicably, incredibly, a 
band of Hells Angels has shown up to guard the stage. Their main weapons are 
pool cues and, when the tide of humanity surges toward the stage, the Angels go 
to work. One huge, fat man, completely naked, waddles toward the stage and is 
cut down by a swift blow to the head. He falls into the crowd and is not seen 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Soon there is blood all around the stage and the concert has descended into 
chaos. Mick Jagger stops the band in an attempt to quiet the crowd and asks, 
"What war are we fighting?" No one seems to know, and minutes later a man is 
stabbed to death by an Angel directly in front of the stage. The Stones are 
then shown choppering out of the site, squeezed into the craft like the last 
Americans leaving Saigon, and Altamont is officially done. 
</P>
<P>
That history is probably why you haven't seen many of those fond recollections 
of Altamont on its 20th anniversary. This place does not fit -- now, at least 
-- with the way we like to remember the '60s. Altamont turned ugly and violent 
and it did that without any help from the authorities. The Age of Aquarius was 
pretty much put to rest by the Aquarians themselves. 
</P>
<P>
And for just those reasons Altamont probably should not be forgotten. It has 
its own tale, and its own lessons.

SPORTS AGENTS SAY MONTOYA DEMANDED THAT THEY PLAY BALL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two representatives of the National Football League Players' Assn. testified 
Monday that Sen. Joseph B. Montoya asked for money and suggested that a 
political contribution would produce favorable action on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
And a former aide to Montoya testified that the senator was pleased when a Los 
Angeles sports agent offered to give the senator a campaign contribution of 
more than $5,000 to ensure that a bill would pass the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony came on the fifth day of Montoya's trial in federal court on 12 
felony counts of extortion, bribery, racketeering and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
David Meggysey, western regional director of the players association, said 
Montoya asked the union to contribute money at the same time he was carrying a 
bill to curb the union's authority. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya (D-Whittier), who had sided with the union on previous legislation, 
introduced a measure in 1986 that would have stripped the union of its power to 
mediate disputes between football players and their agents. 
</P>
<P>
Meggysey told the court that he requested an appointment with Montoya to find 
out why the senator had "reversed his field." 
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon meeting, Meggysey testified, Montoya told him, " 'I've done a lot 
of work for you guys and you guys don't contribute.' " 
</P>
<P>
"My inference was, if we could help out he might change his mind," Meggysey 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
The former linebacker for the St. Louis Cardinals said that he felt betrayed by 
Montoya and that his stance was "a direct stab in the back of the players 
association and what we were trying to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Montoya, Meggysey telephoned Gene Upshaw, a former 
offensive lineman for the Oakland Raiders, who is now executive director of the 
players association. 
</P>
<P>
In that conversation, Upshaw told the court, Meggysey said he now understood 
why the union was having so much difficulty with Montoya's sports agent bill. 
</P>
<P>
"He was upset we were even solicited," Upshaw said. "He just couldn't believe 
it. We don't have any money so we thought it was ridiculous in the first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Both union officials said the players association has a policy against making 
political contributions and never gave money to Montoya. At one point, however, 
Meggysey said he paid $35 for a ticket to a Montoya fund-raising dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Walsh, a San Francisco attorney who has represented the players 
association for more than a decade, testified that he also received requests 
from Montoya for money when the senator was carrying an earlier bill that 
benefited the football players. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he attended a Senate hearing in 1984 on the legislation and had a 
brief conversation with Montoya: "He kind of chuckled and said, 'If you need 
some help on this, I need some help, too,' " Walsh told the court. "I thought 
it was bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
During that period, Montoya was carrying a bill on behalf of the players 
association that placed a series of restrictions on sports agents, including a 
limit on the amount of money agents could charge professional athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh told the court that within two weeks of first meeting Montoya in 1983, 
the senator sent him a fund-raising letter and continued asking for money on a 
"semi-regular" basis. On one occasion, he said, Montoya raised the subject of a 
contribution while talking with Walsh on the telephone about the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Former Montoya aide Kathleen Somerton testified that, while the football 
players' representatives were finding that Montoya was turning against them, 
the senator was accepting a contribution from their opposition, sports agent 
Michael Trope. 
</P>
<P>
Somerton, a former consultant to a Senate sports subcommittee chaired by 
Montoya, testified that Trope had agreed to pay more than $5,000 to win 
approval for a bill limiting the union's power over sports agents. 
</P>
<P>
In a conversation with Montoya, she testified, "I stated that he (Trope) was 
willing to make a significant contribution. He was willing to commit $5,000 to 
$10,000 to see the bill pass." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya was pleased upon hearing the news, she testified. "He said, 'Great,' 
and asked me for Mike's number." 
</P>
<P>
At another point, Somerton said Montoya told her, "The union does not support 
me and I'm not going to support them." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Trope testified at the trial that Montoya sent him a schedule of 
fees requesting $10,000 in campaign contributions and honorariums. He 
ultimately gave the senator $8,100, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving one $5,000 campaign contribution from Trope, Somerton said, 
Montoya expressed disappointment that it was not an honorarium, which he would 
have been able to keep as personal income.

NARCOTICS: RUBEN ZUNO ARCE IS THE 16TH PERSON TO BE CHARGED IN THE 
KIDNAP-MURDER OF THE U.S. DRUG AGENT. HE IS A BROTHER-IN-LAW OF A FORMER 
PRESIDENT OF MEXICO. 
</P>

<P>
A federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted a prominent Mexican businessman on 
charges that he played a key role in arranging the February, 1985, kidnaping 
and murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena, U.S. Atty. Robert Brosio 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Zuno Arce, 59, brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis 
Echeverria, was specifically accused, along with four others, of having 
"organized and put into operation a scheme to kidnap and murder" Camarena. He 
was accused of having participated in a meeting with the four other men in the 
first week of February, 1985, to discuss "the kidnaping and interrogation" of 
Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment asserts that Zuno and the others participated in the plot to 
murder Camarena "for the purpose of maintaining and increasing" their 
trafficking in marijuana and cocaine. The indictment refers to Zuno as being 
part of the "Guadalajara narcotics cartel." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Zuno faces a life term on each of the four counts lodged against 
him, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel Medrano. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno became the 16th person indicted in the case, the most celebrated murder of 
any DEA agent in U.S. history. A DEA agent who has been working on the case 
since the murder said the investigation is continuing. "You can be sure of 
that," said the agent, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno pleaded not guilty Monday when he was arraigned before U.S. District Judge 
Edward Rafeedie. In a loud and clear voice, Zuno proclaimed, through an 
interpreter, that he was "not guilty" and "absolutely innocent" to each of the 
four federal charges lodged against him. 
</P>
<P>
The charges are conspiracy to knowingly and intentionally kidnap, torture, 
interrogate and murder Camarena; aiding and abetting in the kidnaping and 
murder of Camarena; conspiring to kidnap an individual on account of the 
performance of his official duties, and kidnaping an individual because of his 
official duties. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Zuno the four others charged with plotting Camarena's death are 
Rafael Caro Quintero, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, Javier Barba Hernandez and Juan 
Gilberto Hernandez Parra. Caro Quintero and Fonseca Carrillo are in custody in 
Mexico City on separate charges filed by Mexican authorities in the Camarena 
murder. Hernandez Parra was decribed in the indictment as an agent of the 
Mexican Federal Judicial Police. 
</P>
<P>
All five are alleged to be members of the Guadalajara drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno was arrested Saturday night at Los Angeles International Airport when he 
arrived in the United States for a scheduled hearing on other federal charges 
pending against him. He and his lawyers appeared to be stunned by the new 
charges, but declined comment beyond the not-guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Rafeedie ordered Zuno held without bail, despite the pleas of his defense 
lawyer, Edward Medvene, that his client was neither a flight risk nor a threat 
to the community. He had been free on $200,000 bail on federal perjury charges 
and has twice returned to the United States from Mexico for hearings on that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Medrano asserted that Zuno might flee, that he represented a threat 
to witnesses who would testify at his trial and that the charges against him 
were of sufficient gravity to deny him bail. "The complexion of this case is 
night and day different from the perjury case," Medrano said. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno surfaced as a potentially important figure in the Camarena case in August 
when immigration authorities in San Antonio arrested him as a suspected drug 
trafficker and brought him to Los Angeles for questioning as a material witness 
in the ongoing investigation into Camarena's murder. He denied any involvement 
in the murder. 
</P>
<P>
He was held without bail for nearly two months by a variety of federal 
agencies, during which time he testified before a grand jury under a grant of 
immunity. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 7, he was charged with perjuring himself before the grand jury on two 
occasions. That indictment states that Zuno lied when he denied knowing Rafael 
Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo. A trial on the perjury charges is 
scheduled to begin in January before U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi. 
</P>
<P>
Monday marked the first time that federal authorities alleged that Zuno was 
directly involved in Camarena's murder. 
</P>
<P>
"The charges against Zuno go to the heart of this case," prosecutor Medrano 
told Judge Rafeedie. He noted that Zuno has been charged with plotting the 
murder with Caro Quintero and Fonseca Carrillo. "This man rises to that level 
of (drug) trafficker," Medrano asserted. At another point, Medrano asserted 
that Zuno had been "part and parcel of the entire planning stage" of the 
Camarena kidnaping and murder. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno is a member of an influential Mexican family. His father was governor of 
the state of Jalisco, and his sister is married to Echeverria. 
</P>
<P>
Zuno, his attorneys and his wife have consistently denied that he has had any 
involvement with drug trafficking. Rather, they say he is a wealthy businessman 
with interests in ranching, oil and canning, among other enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena was tortured in a Guadalajara house purchased by Caro Quintero in 
January, 1985, less than a month before the murder. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents filed in San Antonio in August, Zuno owned the 
home until Jan. 11, 1985, when he sold it to another man who, in turn, sold it 
to Caro Quintero. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 16 men have been indicted in Los Angeles in connection with the 
Camarena murder. Three of them were convicted in a trial held before Judge 
Rafeedie last year. Raul Lopez Alvarez, a former homicide officer for the 
Mexican Federal Judicial Police, was sentenced to 240 years in prison; Rene 
Martin Verdugo Urquidez, a San Felipe land developer, was sentenced to 240 
years and an additional life term; and Jesus Felix Gutierrez, former owner of a 
Los Angeles area seafood company, was sentenced to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the remaining 13 indicted in the case are fugitives, according to 
prosecutors. Among them are Caro Quintero and Fonseca Carrillo. The Mexican 
government has refused U.S. requests to extradite them to this country. 
</P>
<P>
Other defendants include Armando Pavon Reyes, a former commander of the Mexican 
Federal Judicial Police who originally headed the Mexican government 
investigation into the Camarena murder, and Sergio Espino Verdin, a police 
officer identified by U.S. officials as one of Camarena's interrogators. Pavon 
Reyes and Ines Calderone Quintero are fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, a former Mexican police officer arrested earlier 
this year, is scheduled to go on trial in February for his alleged role in the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena's pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, also was kidnaped and murdered. 
Indictments have been lodged against some of the 16 defendants for their role 
in that killing, but Zuno was not named in those charges. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day Monday, Judge Takasugi denied motions filed by Zuno's lawyers 
that the perjury charges be dropped on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct. The 
lawyers also objected to the fact that a briefcase belonging to Zuno was seized 
when he was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
They asserted that confidential materials were photocopied by government 
agents. Assistant U.S. Atty. Adam Schiff denied that charge.

President Bush, calling drunk driving "one of the most deadly scourges" of our 
times, promised Monday to keep up pressure to get intoxicated drivers off the 
road.

CROATIA COMMUNISTS CALL FOR FREE ELECTIONS AS YUGOSLAV SPLITS WIDEN

<P>
Political divisions in Yugoslavia widened Monday when the Communist Party in 
Croatia called for free multi-party elections next month and the leadership in 
Slovenia accused Serbia of aiming to break up the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Communists have been slow in realizing the "historic exhaustion of the 
single-party system," said Stanko Stojicevic, head of the Croatian Communist 
Party's ruling presidium. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be no democratic socialism without political pluralism based on the 
right of association and competition of political (movements) and programs," 
Stojicevic said. 
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in Zagreb at the start of a Croatian party congress where the 
policy-making Central Committee adopted a proposal that elections should be 
held in January instead of March for the republic's Parliament and should be 
wholly free. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which must be endorsed by the congress, put Croatia, Yugoslavia's 
second largest republic, squarely on the side of Slovenia, whose Communist 
Party has pledged to hold free elections next May for the Slovenian Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
It widened the breach between those two regions and Serbia, the largest of 
Yugoslavia's six republics, whose Communist leadership has explicitly ruled out 
a multi-party system and this month broke all economic relations with Slovenia. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to that move, Slovenian President Janez Stanovnik told his 
republic's Parliament: "The ultimate goal of these attacks is not just Slovenia 
and its leadership. They were just the first phase of a long-term strategy 
whose final phase is the liquidation of Yugoslavia." 
</P>
<P>
Slovenia, which borders Austria and Italy, fears that Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic wants to abolish the power-sharing arrangements between 
Yugoslavia's different nationalities and impose Serbian dominance over the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Croatia's move, which was accompanied by a call to abolish the constitutionally 
guaranteed leading political role of the Communist Party, mirrored the plunge 
into democracy that every Eastern European country except Romania has taken 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia has been 
nonaligned since 1948. But like the others, the Yugoslav Communists had until 
this year claimed the exclusive right to rule and refused to allow free 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
"The present situation in the Communist Party can be changed only in conditions 
of political competition," Stojicevic said. "This is indispensable for the 
party's transformation into a modern political organization."

The four-power agreement on Berlin was signed in the city on Sept. 3, 1971, by 
the U.S., British and French ambassadors to West Germany and the Soviet 
ambassador to East Germany. It went into effect June 3, 1972. Here are its key 
provisions: 
</P>
<P>
Road, rail and waterway traffic between West Germany and West Berlin would be 
unimpeded and facilitated. 
</P>
<P>
West Berliners would be able to visit East Berlin and East Germany on the same 
terms as West Germans. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial cargo in transit between West Germany and West Berlin would be 
sealed and inspection limited to seals and documents. 
</P>
<P>
Private travelers would only be identified, not searched, except in suspected 
cases of "misuse" of the transit routes. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany would pay East Germany an annual sum for use of the transit 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
Ties between West Berlin and West Germany would be developed, taking into 
account that West Berlin continued "not to be a constituent part of the Federal 
Republic of Germany and not to be governed by it." 
</P>
<P>
The West German president, government and Parliament could not perform 
"constitutional or official acts" in West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany could represent West Berlin at international organizations and 
conferences, and perform consular services, but the United States, Britain and 
France retained responsibility for its security and status. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet consulate-general was authorized in West Berlin.

EX-OFFICIAL OF BOLIVIA FLOWN TO U.S. FOR TRIAL

Former Interior Minister Luis Arce Gomez was flown to Miami on Monday for trial 
on charges of trafficking in drugs while he served in the Cabinet of a former 
Bolivian military president. 
</P>
<P>
He has been accused of leading a cocaine trafficking operation while he was 
Bolivia's top law enforcement official. A former army colonel, Arce was also 
accused here of employing then-fugitive Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie to 
advise paramilitary forces that tortured and killed opposition political and 
labor figures. 
</P>
<P>
A federal indictment returned in Miami in 1983 charges that secret police under 
Arce's control seized cocaine from traffickers who failed to pay for protection 
and delivered it to smugglers who did pay. 
</P>
<P>
Two lieutenants of Arce who were charged with him once received $1.5 million 
for cocaine that was confiscated by Bolivian authorities and stored in bank 
vaults, according to the indictment. It says that Arce personally ordered the 
cocaine released. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Miami said Arce was indicted 
along with 18 other people and charged with various violations of U.S. drug 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
While in office here, Arce had a reputation for ruthlessness and for personally 
torturing political prisoners. He was named interior minister in 1980 and 
rounded up hundreds of journalists, political and labor leaders, and church 
officials. Under U.S. pressure, he was removed from office in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Arce fled to Argentina in 1982, where he was later arrested under the Miami 
indictment. But the military government there freed him in December, 1983, just 
before turning over power to the civilian administration of former President 
Raul Alfonsin. 
</P>
<P>
Arce's whereabouts were not known until he was captured Sunday at a ranch near 
Santa Cruz in eastern Bolivia. U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard praised the 
Bolivian government for the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Arce was stripped of Bolivian citizenship last year for failing to show up for 
trial in this country on charges of human rights violations and cocaine 
trafficking.

YOUTHS, POLICE SKIRMISH IN FIRST VIOLENCE OF CHILEAN CAMPAIGN 
</P>

<P>
Campaigning in Chile's first presidential election in 19 years ended Monday 
with tear gas and rock-throwing skirmishes involving youths claiming to be 
followers of the rival candidates, the first violence in an otherwise peaceful 
race. 
</P>
<P>
After the final rally by rightist candidate Hernan Buchi, youths chanting 
slogans in favor of opposition front-runner Patricio Aylwin stoned police 
patrolling Alameda Bernardo O'Higgins, a broad avenue in the center of the 
capital. Police responded with barrages of high-pressure water and tear-gas 
grenades. 
</P>
<P>
No more than 200 youths appeared to take part actively in the clashes that 
lasted nearly three hours. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-evening, hundreds of Buchi supporters marched from the rally site to the 
Alameda, and scattered fighting broke out between the Buchi marchers and the 
groups that had been fighting the police. Several people were hit by stones. It 
was unclear whether any of the injuries were serious. 
</P>
<P>
The race to succeed outgoing President Augusto Pinochet, who took power after a 
bloody 1973 coup, had evolved calmly. By law, campaigning ended Monday to allow 
voters two days of reflection before Thursday's balloting, which also will 
decide 120 House and 38 Senate seats. 
</P>
<P>
Aylwin, far ahead in the polls, heads a 17-party coalition of parties ranging 
from center to left. Buchi, Pinochet's former finance minister, is supported by 
two rightist parties. 
</P>
<P>
Buchi has stressed the social order and economic progress brought by the 
Pinochet government, in contrast to the turmoil of the 1970-73 rule of Marxist 
President Salvador Allende, which ended with Pinochet's coup. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the rock-throwers who attacked the police and the Buchi 
supporters were far-left militants, thugs out to stir up trouble or 
provocateurs. Any violence ill serves the Aylwin coalition in its attempt to 
project an image of moderation and accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, tens of thousands of people filled a major Santiago avenue for Buchi's 
final rally, far fewer than the hundreds of thousands who attended Aylwin's 
final campaign celebration on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The athletic 40-year-old Buchi repeatedly attacked the opposition alliance for 
including parties and candidates who had participated in Allende's Popular 
Unity coalition. Buchi suggested that Aylwin, a centrist who leads the 
Christian Democratic Party, would prove unable to control the leftists in his 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows if a vote for Patricio Aylwin is a vote for the Christian 
Democrats or the Socialists or the Communists," Buchi said. "Are you against 
violence and terrorism? They are not."

BENNETT ASSAILS INTELLECTUALS ON LEGALIZED DRUGS 
</P>

<P>
In an angry blast at those who would legalize narcotics, National Drug Control 
Policy Director William J. Bennett on Monday accused American intellectuals of 
advocating a "scandalous" surrender in the national war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Get with the program," Bennett urged an audience at Harvard University, "or, 
at the very least, get in the game." He said that the failure of scholars and 
pundits to "get serious" about drugs reflected a lack of "civic courage." 
</P>
<P>
The strongly worded address was clearly intended to counter what Bennett has 
described as a disturbing trend of resurgent support among influential 
Americans for the idea that the drug problem might best be addressed through 
legalization. 
</P>
<P>
Although the plain-spoken drug czar had never made a secret of his disgust for 
that approach, his decision to elevate the public scoldings to the status of a 
full-fledged speech appeared to signify increased concern that the growing 
visibility of the idea might undermine the Administration's harder-line 
anti-drug policies. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, sounding like the professor he once was, assailed the arguments 
offered for legalization as "very thin gruel indeed." Rather than being a 
solution to the drug problem, he said, they represent what "more sober minds 
recognize as a recipe for a public policy disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of legalization include such notable figures as former Secretary of 
State George P. Shultz, Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman, American 
Civil Liberties Union President Ira Glasser, Princeton University Prof. Ethan 
Nadelmann and syndicated columnists William F. Buckley and Anthony Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Their particular arguments vary, but a common theme holds that to make drugs 
legal would put an end to profit in drug trafficking -- and, with it, the 
violent crime it spawns. Consumption of drugs, they argue, would be unlikely to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
In his response, Bennett contended that criminal sanctions provide a vital 
"incentive to stay away from a life of drugs." With legalization, he said, 
"drug use will go up, way up." And, even in a world in which drugs were legal, 
addicts would continue to rob and steal, and street traffickers would sell to 
minors or try to undercut the legalized price. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks at Harvard, Bennett held both the right and left of the 
political spectrum at fault for giving short shrift to anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Some conservatives, he noted, regard the drug problem as a malady limited to 
the inner city and believe it calls for nothing more than "quarantine." At the 
same time, liberals assert that the problem is not drugs at all but rather 
poverty or racism. The common result, Bennett said, is a "policy of neglect." 
</P>
<P>
But his most forceful criticisms were directed at liberals, who he suggested 
had been hypocritical in complaining endlessly about the effects that the 
Ronald Reagan Administration policies had exacted on the "defenseless poor" 
while ignoring the disproportionate burden that the drug problem imposed on the 
underclass.

SAN DIEGO SHERIFF DROPS ELECTION BID, BLASTS THE MEDIA 
</P>

<P>
After almost two decades in office but besieged in recent months by allegations 
of poor management, San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy unexpectedly announced 
Monday that he will not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy stood before a group of reporters and, his eyes tearing over, blamed the 
media for focusing on his frequent trips outside the county, his undisclosed 
income as a private consultant and questions about whether county taxpayers may 
have paid for part of his home security system. 
</P>
<P>
"They're interested in driving me from office, and they've done it," the 
five-term sheriff said. "The media has won. Let's concede it." 
</P>
<P>
News of his decision to pull out of next year's race prompted Jack Drown, an 
assistant sheriff who has worked for 20 years under Duffy's tutelage, to say he 
will join three other candidates in filing for the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's unexpected announcement brought the lament from supporters that his 
departure will be a blow to professional law enforcement, but many of his 
enemies said his exit comes none too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Duffy has now stepped into the pages of history," said Mike Aguirre, a San 
Diego lawyer who has criticized the sheriff for years. "He really is not a 
player anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Locally, he will be remembered basically as a bully, as someone who was in 
office too long and misused his position. He will be remembered as the J. Edgar 
Hoover of San Diego law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
But William Cowling, a strong Duffy backer and long active in the Honorary 
Deputy Sheriff's Assn., called Duffy "the greatest law enforcement officer 
there's ever been." 
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old Duffy has been a member of the Sheriff's Department since 1953 
and was first elected sheriff in 1970, while still a captain. 
</P>
<P>
He called the press conference Monday for what was expected to be his 
announcement that he would appeal a judge's decision last week lifting a 
temporary restraining order preventing the Los Angeles Times from publishing an 
article about his home security system. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff had sought -- and obtained -- the court order because he feared The 
Times would publish detailed information about his new home in Scripps Ranch 
that, he said, could invade his privacy and jeopardize his family's safety. 
</P>
<P>
But when reporters assembled at the sheriff's headquarters, Duffy began reading 
a long prepared statement in which he blasted the media and the 
"multimillion-dollar, profit-making corporation" that runs The Times. He 
charged that recent publicity about his home security, coupled with the judge's 
decision to lift the restraining order, places him and his wife in danger of 
being harmed by intruders. 
</P>
<P>
"The power of the media in this country is awesome and is a threat to every 
American," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He singled out The Times, saying, "I don't trust them to protect me."

GINJI YASUDA; OWNED VEGAS' ALADDIN HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ginji Yasuda, the flamboyant international playboy who was the first foreigner 
ever granted a Nevada gambling license when he took over the troubled Aladdin 
Hotel, has died, it was confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Vanyo, chief of the enforcement division of the Nevada State Gaming 
Control Board, said Yasuda died Dec. 3 in a cancer treatment center in Los 
Angeles, but he did not know which one. 
</P>
<P>
A Yasuda family attorney in Los Angeles did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
His death came three months after a bankruptcy trustee was appointed to operate 
the Aladdin in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Yasuda, 57, the Korean-born son of a wealthy Japanese businessman, had 
purchased the hotel and casino for $54 million out of bankruptcy after the 
Teamsters Central States Pension Fund had foreclosed its loans. 
</P>
<P>
Yasuda operated the hotel but not the casino for more than a year while gaming 
officials investigated his background. The investigation was lengthy because of 
difficulty in tracing Yasuda's years in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, Yasuda made history as the first foreigner to receive a 
Nevada casino license. The Nevada Gaming Commission put a two-year expiration 
on the license and required Yasuda to appoint experienced casino managers. 
</P>
<P>
He spent millions more on improvements and remodeling and hired a professional 
management team headed by Dennis Gomes, now president of the Golden Nugget 
casino. But Yasuda and Gomes could not agree on operation of the resort, and 
Yasuda fired the Gomes management team in September, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble-scarred veteran hotel on the Las Vegas Strip had undergone a series 
of earlier owners, including entertainer Wayne Newton, and had also been 
investigated by the gaming board for giving free rooms, food and drink to many 
known mobsters. 
</P>
<P>
Yasuda, whose Korean name was Sam K. Park, was known on the Strip as a 
high-stakes gambler who was a breeder of racehorses and an avid skeet shooter. 
In the 1960s he drove on the international sports-car circuit. 
</P>
<P>
More recently he had commuted between Japan and his palatial home in the Holmby 
Hills area of Los Angeles. He also owned a ranch in Bradbury where he raised 
racehorses. 
</P>
<P>
He supposedly inherited a fortune from his father and used the proceeds from a 
$120-million sale of a downtown Tokyo property to purchase the Aladdin. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1986, even before Yasuda was able to reopen the Aladdin casino, 
there were reports that he was unable to pay some vendors for their goods. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Yasuda's lender put the hotel property in foreclosure for past due 
mortgage payments and set Sept. 6 as the date for a public auction. In August, 
Yasuda lost his gaming license and filed for bankruptcy, listing $121 million 
in debts and $83 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
The resort is being operated by a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee. Jeff 
Silver, a Las Vegas attorney familiar with the restructuring, said an auction 
of Aladdin property has been scheduled in April but chances also remain good 
that a new buyer will be found.

CRITIC AT LARGE: DEPARDIEU: A FRENCHMAN'S PASSION FOR FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gerard Depardieu had finished "Cyrano de Bergerac" in Paris at 5 the previous 
afternoon and hopped a plane to Manhattan, where his film "Too Beautiful for 
You" was the opening-night attraction at the New York Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
He was still wearing the long hair and a mustache grown for Cyrano, just in 
case retakes would be needed. Lumberjack-large and in a smock-like black shirt 
and black trousers, he suggested Rodin's sculpture of Balzac more than Rodin, 
whom he plays in "Camille Claudel," which opens Dec. 22 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In "Too Beautiful for You," which will be released here in February, Depardieu 
plays a car dealer torn between his love for his exquisitely beautiful wife and 
a plain, frumpy but passionately devoted mistress. It is a reordering of the 
classic triangle, with sharp and wounding corners however it's turned. 
</P>
<P>
The film is also his fifth with writer-director Bertrand Blier. Their first 
collaboration, "Going Places" ("Les Valseuses") in 1974, established Depardieu 
as a star. He and the late Patrick Dewaere played a pair of layabouts who meet 
up, with fateful consequences, with Jeanne Moreau. 
</P>
<P>
"I was young, unconscious and very dangerous," Depardieu said in his hotel 
suite the afternoon after the festival opening. "My father saw the film and 
said, 'Ah, yes, that's Gerard all right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu spoke through a translator, with tentative bursts of English. He will 
make his second film in English in New York and Los Angeles starting in 
February. It is "The Green Card," which director Peter Weir ("Dead Poets 
Society") wrote especially for Depardieu. 
</P>
<P>
His first venture in English, "I Want to Go Home," directed by Alain Resnais 
from a script by Jules Feiffer, was a success at the Venice Film Festival 
earlier this year. In it, lyricist Adolph Green plays a temporarily expatriate 
cartoonist, Depardieu a Flaubert scholar. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu somewhat resembles Michael Caine in his apparently compulsive drive 
to work constantly, but money does not seem to be the immediate object. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I make a film for two bottles of good wine," he says. "I made three 
films without being paid at all, and none is a success. I make no money yet 
from 'Too Beautiful for You.' But," he explains with a devastating smile, "I 
have a sympathetic banker." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he produces or co-produces all his own films now. "Truffaut told me 
how to get more involved," Depardieu says. "It's better not to get paid a lot. 
I don't want to have to make movies just to pay taxes." He admits he is in the 
60% bracket. "Anyway, it stifles interesting projects to ask for a lot of money 
at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
But even so, no benefits will be required for him. A few years ago, he bought a 
castle, with vineyards, in Anjou. Joan of Arc is said to have slept there. 
</P>
<P>
"The '89 vintage is very good, great," Depardieu says. He loves the land and 
watching the vines and, occasionally, he adds, he feels some of the resonances 
of "Jean de Florette," one of the films in which he achieved a great critical 
success and in which feelings about land was a central theme. 
</P>
<P>
If he hints of Caine in his constant employment, Depardieu also has a parallel 
with Steve McQueen as a man whose early teen-age years could have as easily led 
him to jail as to fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in the small city of Chateauroux in central France, with an American 
air base just outside town. "I saw rock 'n' roll movies. It was a big taste of 
American culture." He fell in love with blue jeans and T-shirts and kept 
himself supplied, he says, by stealing them from laundry lines. He admits that 
he was a juvenile delinquent in training. 
</P>
<P>
He also saw his first blacks -- GIs who were, he says, "received like gods" 
because of their unfamiliarity. He had a casual black girlfriend and was 
kissing her when a French friend angrily told him off. "It was my first 
experience with racism," Depardieu says, "so of course I kept on kissing her, 
as my personal blow against racism." 
</P>
<P>
He and his pals hung out at the train station, watching with envy as people 
left for the mysterious glamour of Paris. One pal who was studying acting in 
Paris came home on a visit and it did not take much urging to persuade 
Depardieu to come back with him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was easier to leave home then," Depardieu explains. He was 15. He joined a 
workshop and his life and education began again. At 16, already working in 
theater, he met Elizabeth Guignot, who became his wife and still is. 
</P>
<P>
"I discovered immediately that I am never afraid on stage. I am nervous in 
sports, but I am at peace on the stage." With his first money, he bought an 
alarm clock and a book. "I learned again how to read, to decipher tragedy, to 
understand things I didn't really understand." 
</P>
<P>
Not yet 17, he made his first film, a small documentary by Roger Lennart, "the 
patron of my new life," about Socrates as the first beatnik. He started 
"Christmas Carol" with Agnes Varda but it was never finished. ("People started 
living and stopped shooting," he says cryptically.) 
</P>
<P>
On stage, he did David Storey's "Home" and was offered a role in the Paris 
production of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" but turned it down because he 
thought the translation failed to do justice to the material. 
</P>
<P>
He made his first feature at 22 in 1970 and has hardly paused since. He 
appeared in Marguerite Duras' "Nathalie Granger" in 1972 and in 1974 the 
significant "Going Places," which his aura of smoldering danger helped make an 
international success. 
</P>
<P>
The work since is an anthology of the best contemporary French and European 
cinema: Blier's "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs," Resnais' "My Uncle in America," 
Truffaut's "The Last Metro," Daniel Vigne's "The Return of Martin Guerre," 
Andrzej Wajda's "Danton," Bernardo Bertolucci's "1900," Maurice Pialat's "Under 
the Sign of Satan" (best film at the 1987 Cannes festival) and Claude Berri's 
"Jean de Florette." It is a partial list. 
</P>
<P>
Blier's "Too Beautiful for You" is frequently funny and just as frequently 
baffling, not least to Depardieu. "After seven weeks of shooting, I said, 'I 
don't know what we're doing.' Blier and I were pacing around a courtyard and he 
looked pale and terrible. He said it was the food we had yesterday. I said, 
'No, it's the film.' " 
</P>
<P>
In "Camille Claudel," which was directed by veteran cinematographer Bruno 
Nuytten, Depardieu's Rodin is inevitably overshadowed by Isabelle Adjani's 
extraordinary performance as the young protegee (sister of the poet Paul 
Claudel) who went mad for the lost love of him. But his Rodin -- imperious, 
self-centered, driven, leaning close to models and materials because of acute 
myopia, pushing and tugging to arrange the masses he could see in the mind's 
eye -- is a remarkable characterization. In an actor's magical mathematics, it 
is all Rodin, and all Depardieu. 
</P>
<P>
"I like playing historic personages," he says. "I learn more of my own 
history." Contemplating Rodin, he confesses, "The one trap I've fallen into is 
playing characters who are a little bit cowardly. I've made a true career of 
masochism."

NATURAL DISASTER: The gusty winds buffeting Orange County (A1) may seem 
threatening, but they're lightweights compared to the county's No. 1 natural

sustained more than $30 million in crop damage, mostly the result of cold

TROUBLE BLOWS IN ON 100-M.P.H. SANTA ANAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN and ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chill, dry Santa Ana winds howled down Southern California's mountain passes 
and canyons at speeds of up to 100 m.p.h. Monday, toppling trucks, shredding 
Christmas decorations and kicking up dust storms that triggered traffic 
accidents and forced the temporary closure of three freeways. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, power was knocked out to thousands of residential and business 
customers in widely scattered areas, and arcing power lines, downed by the 
hurricane-force gusts, ignited several small brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
The flames were quickly extinguished, but officials said the winds, generated 
by a vast complex of weather systems over the Rockies, were parching the 
already dry Los Angeles Basin, increasing the danger of additional fires. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful winds prompted the Orange County Fire Department to call a "red 
flag alert," an extra high state of readiness to protect against the threat of 
wind-whipped fires. But department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said that 
firefighters handled only a few brush fires. At nightfall, firefighters had 
contained most of a four-acre blaze that had started Monday afternoon on Bonita 
Canyon Drive in Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the wind damage was confined to San Bernardino, Riverside and 
Orange counties Monday morning, forecasters said the Santa Anas should begin 
moving into the Los Angeles area before dawn today. 
</P>
<P>
The winds are threatening the second Medfly pesticide spraying in Orange County 
history, scheduled for tonight at 9 p.m. over an 11-square-mile area that 
includes parts of La Habra, Brea and Fullerton. State agriculture officials 
said they may not be able to spray if the winds exceed 5 m.p.h., for fear of 
spreading the pesticide mix beyond the target area. 
</P>
<P>
But meteorologists were optimistic that the winds wouldn't interfere with the 
aerial spraying. Sunny skies and temperatures ranging from the mid-60s to 
mid-70s have been forecast for today. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest winds reported Monday were gusts of 100 m.p.h. near the Grapevine 
in southern Kern County, 85 m.p.h near Devore at the base of Cajon Pass, and 80 
m.p.h. on the hilltops above Point Mugu in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
As is often the case with Santa Anas, communities below the Cajon Pass in the 
San Bernardino area were among the hardest hit Monday, with portions of three 
freeways there closed by opaque clouds of wind-whipped dust and sand. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic is heavy; the visibility is poor and down to zero in some 
stretches," California Highway Patrol Officer Marty Bell reported Monday 
morning from San Bernardino. "It's best to just stay out of the area altogether 
if possible." 
</P>
<P>
The winds prevented about 60 sixth-graders at Trabuco Elementary School from 
venturing on a weeklong trip to the Arbolado Science Camp in the San Bernardino 
Mountains. School officials canceled the trip after CHP officers warned that it 
would be dangerous to travel in buses to the camp, which is located at the 
6,500-foot level. The 6th-grade class will try again today. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, at least four big rigs, a number of travel trailers and several 
motorcycles had been blown over by the heavy winds, most of them on California 
60 and Interstate 15, east of Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
No serious injuries were reported, but one unidentified driver was scraped and 
bruised when the winds toppled his truck. 
</P>
<P>
A CHP officer said the back window of his patrol car was blown out by a strong 
gust. Several motorists took refuge on the lee side of embankments and 
overpasses to wait out the fiercest of the winds. 
</P>
<P>
"It was blowing like mad," said John Anderson, a CHP spokesman in Riverside. 
"And the dust. Whew! What a mess. A lot of people were just waiting out the 
storm." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said one travel trailer was ripped from the pickup truck towing it and 
tossed over the guardrail of an overpass above California 60, east of Ontario. 
He said the driver "probably got to Indio, looked in his rear-view mirror and 
then wondered where that son of a gun was." 
</P>
<P>
A section of Interstate 10 near Ontario International Airport also was closed 
for a time, but the airport was able to maintain normal flight operations. 
</P>
<P>
At John Wayne Airport, gusts were clocked at up to 35 m.p.h., forcing aircraft 
to take off in an inland direction rather than over the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP reported no wind-related troubles on most Orange County highways. Dust 
storms, however, limited visibility to about a mile on the Riverside Freeway in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoor Christmas decorations took a beating, especially in western San 
Bernardino County, and trees blew over at Christmas tree lots throughout the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
The gusts churned up waves during some unusually high tides along the coast. 
Several stretches of Pacific Coast Highway in Orange County were sporadically 
awash with seawater Monday morning. Forecasters said similar conditions could 
occur today. 
</P>
<P>
Power lines were downed across a broad swath of the Southland, knocking out 
service to at least 16,000 homes and businesses in Orange County and causing 
scattered outages in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison Co. crews were kept busy restoring electrical 
service during the morning. Edison spokesman Steve Nelson said most of the 
outages were momentary, although some areas were without power for considerably 
longer periods. 
</P>
<P>
Downed lines started several small brush fires that were quickly brought under 
control in the Glen Avon area of Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
But fire officials said the low humidity that accompanied the arid Santa Ana 
winds was drying out the already-parched chaparral in the foothills and was 
threatening to whip any blazes that started into major fires. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with WeatherData, said the strong winds resulted 
from the interaction of two major weather systems over the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
The first system, a cold and vigorous high-level storm system, pulled a strong 
and arid high-pressure system in behind it, Dittmann said, generating a chilly 
stream of dry, down-slope winds that rapidly invaded Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County escaped the hurricane-force winds because "the surface low 
pressure area was not far enough south and west," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures and humidity dropped as the winds rattled into the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Thermometer readings in the chilly mid-40s were common Monday morning, with a 
low at the Los Angeles Civic Center of 47 degrees. The humidity in downtown Los 
Angeles dropped from a high of 86% to a low of just 16%. 
</P>
<P>
National Weather Service meteorologists said they expect the high-pressure 
system to stay in place long enough for a resumption of strong winds before 
dawn that will not ease until sometime this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
WeatherData meteorologists said they expect the high pressure to begin moving 
east a little sooner, with lesser winds diminishing earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters agreed that today's high temperatures should be mostly in the 70s. 
</P>

Los Angeles. Times staff writers Davan Maharaj, Chris Woodyard and Ted Johnson 
contributed from Orange County and Carol McGraw from Los Angeles.

HONG KONG DEPORTS VIET 'BOAT PEOPLE' FOR FIRST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

HONG KONG 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite strong objections from the United States, the British territory of Hong 
Kong early today deported to Hanoi 51 Vietnamese, most of them children, who 
came here seeking political asylum in the West but were later deemed to be 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The expulsions marked the first time since the fall of Saigon to the Communists 
nearly 15 years ago that large numbers of Vietnamese have been forcibly 
repatriated to their homeland. They are expected to be the vanguard of tens of 
thousands of other Vietnamese awaiting their fate in camps and detention 
centers throughout Asia. 
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong government statement said no force was used in moving the 8 men, 17 
women and 26 children from their quarters at 3 a.m. "They were calm. There was 
no incident," a government spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
But witnesses said that as the "boat people" were being taken from the Phoenix 
House detention center, some of them shouted and moaned, unfurling a banner 
asking "Where Is Your Humanity?" There were reports that some of the refugees 
had locked themselves in a room at the center when police arrived and only 
reluctantly agreed to leave. 
</P>
<P>
As the expulsions were carried out, Vietnamese refugees in Orange County 
furiously deplored the Hong Kong government's actions, which one local leader 
called "a betrayal of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe in the free world's leadership, but this, to us, is a sellout," 
said Tony Lam, a community activist and former president of Orange County's 
Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. About 100,000 Vietnamese live in Orange County, 
so many that local refugees refer to Little Saigon, in Westminster, as the 
"Vietnamese capital abroad." 
</P>
<P>
The 51 expelled refugees were taken to Hong Kong's airport in a fleet of six 
trucks, where they boarded a chartered Cathay Pacific airlines Tristar jetliner 
for the flight to Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
They were among the first Vietnamese to have arrived here since June 16, 1988, 
when the government adopted a policy of screening out so-called economic 
migrants from political refugees in an effort to stem a tide of boat people 
leaving Vietnam. In the interim, nearly 44,000 people have arrived in Hong Kong 
seeking asylum in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The deportations from Hong Kong, which the government has termed "mandatory 
repatriation," are expected to be followed by similar expulsions of "boat 
people" by Malaysia and Thailand, which also have provided temporary asylum to 
Vietnamese refugees awaiting screening. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the deportations provoked an outcry in Britain, where the 
opposition Labor Party described the move as "a wretched, discredited and 
shameful action." 
</P>
<P>
Le Bphuong, a Garden Grove resident who fled his native Vietnam in 1980, 
tearfully agreed. "In our country, any Vietnamese is my friend, so this hurts 
me very much. . . . These people landed in one of the countries where they 
praise the freedom, but there they are persecuted again." 
</P>
<P>
The London-based human rights monitoring organization Amnesty International 
called on the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to halt further 
repatriations, saying the screening procedure used to identify economic 
migrants is "critically flawed." 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate decision to start repatriations lay with the British government, 
which continues to be responsible for Hong Kong's foreign affairs until 1997, 
when the territory reverts to Chinese control. 
</P>
<P>
The deportations began after Hong Kong and Vietnamese officials reached final 
agreement on the details of the flights of returning refugees. The agreement 
apparently included face-saving language that met Hanoi's objections against 
receiving anyone who was forced to return against his will. 
</P>
<P>
The policy of forced repatriation is extremely popular in this British 
territory, reflecting not only the historic racial animosity between Vietnamese 
and Chinese but hardships for Chinese who attempt to emigrate to Hong Kong. 
Every year, the authorities turn back an estimated 20,000 Chinese caught 
entering Hong Kong illegally, including many who have relatives here. 
</P>
<P>
"The boat people are threatening our security, straining the relationship 
between people and government," said Ho Yin Fat, a member of Hong Kong's 
Legislative Council who has led the campaign for forced repatriation. "Camps 
are being placed everywhere in residential neighborhoods. The people are up in 
arms. They are spending a lot of money on this problem." 
</P>
<P>
Ho and others have accused the United States of hypocrisy for objecting to the 
forced return of the Vietnamese while continuing to send home Haitians, Cubans 
and Central Americans seeking to improve their economic situation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Vietnamese coming to Hong Kong are not running away from political 
ideology," Ho said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
However, Legislative Councillor Martin Lee has publicly cautioned Hong Kong 
against sending the "boat people" home, recalling that after 1997 many Hong 
Kong residents may find themselves similarly seeking asylum in the West, and 
the repatriation policy could come back to haunt them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is bound to have a very great adverse effect on our fight for our right 
of abode (in Britain) or any form of passport arrangements in the United 
Kingdom," he wrote recently. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese refugees themselves have seized on this point. A banner raised 
the other day in the Whitehead detention center warned, "Hong Kong: Our Today 
Is Your Tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Davis, a professor of applied social studies at the City Polytechnic of 
Hong Kong, has warned that repatriation at this time will be pointless because 
the widespread poverty in Vietnam offers little alternative to millions of 
unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
"If you push them back now, it will inevitably bring violence," Davis said. 
"People are worried, frightened, scared. There may be a move to mass suicide. 
We've had riots and hunger strikes; what more can they do?" 
</P>
<P>
Vann Phan, a staff writer for the English-language section of Nguoi Viet News 
in Westminster, predicted that refugees who are returned to Vietnam would be 
forced to live in remote areas of the country and put to hard labor. Phan, a 
former military officer who said he was imprisoned for six years in a 
Vietnamese re-education camp, called the repatriation program "a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Speculation about the start of repatriations has caused anxiety in the Hong 
Kong detention centers. There have been reports of hunger strikes, all-night 
vigils and people sleeping with their shoes on so they can try to escape if the 
authorities descend on them suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
There has also been an upsurge of violence in the centers, apparently led by 
organized gangs. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there were 56,117 Vietnamese in refugee camps and detention centers in 
Hong Kong before the first flight today, including about 5,000 children under 
the age of 18. Of that number, 12,219 are considered refugees, meaning they 
arrived before June 16, 1988, or are among 703 persons not screened out. Of the 
remaining 43,898, almost 6,500 have either been screened out or are waiting to 
be screened. 
</P>
<P>
After being screened out, a boat person can appeal the decision, and about 10% 
have had the decision overturned. Then the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner 
for Refugees in Geneva can declare rejected persons refugees, but it has 
exercised the mandate in only 32 cases so far. 
</P>
<P>
"The eventual results of screening are as good as can be expected, but that's 
not a 100% endorsement of the procedure," said Raymond Hall, a spokesman for 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Adrie P. Van Gelderen, refugee coordinator for International Social Service, a 
Geneva-based private relief group, said his organization opposes repatriation 
on "the principle that it is unacceptable to send people back to a place from 
which they've run." 
</P>
<P>
Van Gelderen, who has representatives in virtually all the camps, said the 
start of repatriation will be sure to cause riots in the camps and could 
backfire on British authorities if they are forced by public opinion to suspend 
the expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gelderen said the authorities should have allowed more time for a program 
of voluntary repatriation to succeed. This program was also endorsed by the 
U.N. agency. 
</P>
<P>
The voluntary program started 14 months ago, and under it only 650 people have 
returned to Vietnam. Another 1,000 have volunteered to go back and had been 
expected to do so this month, but the Vietnamese have said they are unable to 
keep up with the crush. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not make sense to me to send back people who do not want to go back, 
in mandatory repatriation, when they have volunteers who are waiting to go 
back," Van Gelderen said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency pays the costs of the voluntary program, while the British and 
Hong Kong government must pay the costs of forced repatriation. Another problem 
is that the British have so far failed to persuade the U.N. group to monitor 
the forced repatriation on the Vietnamese end to ensure that returned refugees 
are not mistreated, as the agency has agreed to do with volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Voluntary returnees are paid $500 by the agency, while those forced back will 
get nothing. Britain reportedly will pay the Hanoi government $620 per person 
to cover resettlement costs. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the differences, British and Hong Kong officials are clearly counting 
on the repatriation programs to save the colony from inundation by boat people. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be in deep trouble if we're hit by the same number of boat people next 
year; we'll have enormous problems," said Michael Hanson, Hong Kong's refugee 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and other countries "need to explain what we are to do with 
these people," he added. 
</P>
<P>
That was a reference to the slow pace at which Western countries, including the 
United States, have been accepting people who successfully qualify as refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Although resettlement is guaranteed, no quotas have been established. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 12,219 political refugees in the resettlement camps here, most of whom 
arrived before the 1988 deadline and were thus automatically declared eligible 
for resettlement, more than 2,000 have been waiting more than seven years.

RACE RELATIONS: THE TWO PRODUCTIONS ARE AIMED AT INSTILLING POLICE WITH 
FEELINGS OF RESPECT AND SENSITIVITY WHEN DEALING WITH LATINO AND SOUTHEAST

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One young Latino chases another through a parking lot and slams him against the 
trunk of a car. 
</P>
<P>
"Chill out! Chill out!" the youth under attack pleads. But the fight goes on 
and both combatants fall to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Cut!" the director barks, and the two men break apart and smile. An 
appreciative audience of extras and crew applauds. 
</P>
<P>
Though the seconds-long fight scene took hours to produce, it will not find its 
way into a Hollywood movie or an episode of MacGyver. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it will become part of a training video for police officers in Orange 
County. The fight between the two young men -- which in the film occurs at a 
family party -- sets up the entrance of two police officers who demonstrate how 
to close down the rowdy affair without inciting the guests to more violence. 
</P>
<P>
Through such examples, the Orange County Human Relations Commission and Santa 
Ana Police Department -- which co-produced the film -- hope to show police 
officers that a better understanding of culturally and ethnically sensitive 
situations can make their jobs easier and boost their image in minority 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
One of the videos is aimed at raising police officers' awareness of Latino 
culture and another will deal with the Vietnamese community. 
</P>
<P>
Editing has begun on the Latino video, which recently finished shooting with a 
mix of professional and amateur actors at locales around Orange County -- from 
a Santa Ana burger stand to the surf and sands at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The script for the video, to be called "Common Ground," was written by Jose 
Cruz Gonzalez of the Hispanic Playwrights Project at South Coast Repertory. One 
of its main points is that Latinos, like police officers, place a high degree 
of importance on being treated with respect. 
</P>
<P>
The script calls for an "Adam-12" type format in which a pair of actors playing 
police officers are seen in re-enactments of actual incidents. The incidents 
were chosen to show how recognition of cultural differences can defuse 
potential confrontations and improve the image of police in the Latino 
community. 
</P>
<P>
In one scene, for instance, the senior officer agrees to honor the request of a 
suspected wife-beater who wants to be handcuffed outside his house and out of 
sight of his children. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't hurt to take a minute and explain what we're doing. Besides, maybe 
next time his kids see one of us they won't be afraid," the actor/officer 
explains to his partner. 
</P>
<P>
In the party scene, officers respond to a complaint about noise at a 
quinceanera, a traditional Mexican-debut celebration marking a girl's 15th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Aware that a fight between two youths has just occurred outside, the officers 
take the girl's father out of earshot from the others and explain that the 
party is out of control. They courteously ask him to tell everyone to go home. 
</P>
<P>
"Respect," the officer later tells his partner. "That's all it takes." 
</P>
<P>
The project has received an outpouring of support and donations from Latino 
groups and businesses, police departments and corporate donors, according to 
Vicki Plevin, who is co-producing the videos for the Human Relations 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer Extras 
</P>
<P>
Scores of extras from Orange County community groups like Manos Unidas, Spanish 
for "hands united," dressed up for the crowd and ballroom scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Palomino of Westminster, vice president of Manos Unidas, said the group's 
members felt their participation was important to help make officers more aware 
of cultural differences. In times past, "they didn't have the ethnic 
sensitivity they should have," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One incident that outraged Westminster's Latino community was the July, 1988, 
shooting of 18-year-old Frank Martinez in his back yard during a birthday 
celebration for his mother. Police maintained that Martinez and an angry mob 
attacked three officers who were at the home to question Martinez's brother 
about a neighborhood gang incident. Martinez's family, however, has claimed 
that police shot the unarmed youth as he tried to rise from the ground and 
flee. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Grand Jury decided not to indict any of the officers involved 
in the shooting, but the family has filed a $110-million lawsuit against the 
Westminster Police Department, alleging violations of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Human Relations Commission, said the 
video project was approved in hopes of improving understanding between police 
and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very desirable among (police) departments to build better relationships 
in the Hispanic community," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Police Officer Kevin Brown served as technical adviser on the 
project, making sure that the two actors looked, talked and appeared like real 
officers. Among other things, he made sure that they carried their flashlights 
in their left hands in case they needed to reach for their guns in a hurry. And 
he showed them how to carry billy clubs on their laps in a patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
Plevin said the project is also receiving technical help from police 
departments in Westminster, Anaheim, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, San 
Clemente and Fullerton, and from the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The videos, which are being produced on a $10,000 budget, are intended 
primarily to be shown to police officers at roll calls before they head out on 
daily patrol, Plevin said. The project has received donations, both monetary 
and in-kind, valued at thousands of dollars more.

CRANSTON PLANS TOUR OF LAGUNA LAUREL SITE;

CANYON: CRANSTON WILL GET FIRSTHAND LOOK

<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston will tour Laguna Canyon with officials from Laguna Beach and 
the Irvine Co. Friday to view the proposed site of a 3,200-home residential 
development that has fueled a decade-long battle between th developer and local 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the visit is to give the senator an update on the progress of 
discussions going on regarding Laguna Canyon," said Gil Saldana, an aide to the 
California Democrat. "In 1981 the senator authored a (failed) bill that would 
have made the canyon and Irvine Coast a national park, so now he's interested 
in the local efforts that are now taking place." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston will visit the 2,150-acre Laguna Laurel project site as part of a 
one-day trip to Orange County that will also include stops in Santa Ana and 
Newport Beach, aides said. They said Cranston wanted to get a firsthand look at 
the project area, anticipating the possibility of a future request for federal 
funding from local officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The senator has not taken a position on the development and will not take a 
position on the development," Saldana said. "But in the event that the Irvine 
Co. decides it will relocate the project out of Laguna Canyon, we imagine the 
Laguna Beach officials will probably need some financial assistance to acquire 
the land." 
</P>
<P>
He did not specify which funds or how much federal money could be available to 
Laguna Beach for land acquisition to preserve open space. 
</P>
<P>
The Cranston visit comes several weeks after the Irvine Co. announced it would 
consider moving the project out of the canyon into neighboring Irvine, if 
officials from the two cities agree to a set of stringent demands on the scope, 
finances and review process for the development. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 10 years, city officials and the Irvine Co. have been at odds over 
the proposed residential development slated for the mouth of Laguna Canyon. The 
development would include apartments and condominiums, a golf course, a school 
and shopping center, along with public parks and preserved terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach residents and many local officials fear the large development 
would damage the environmentally sensitive canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. officials said they were recently contacted by Cranston's office 
inquiring about the status of the negotiations between the cities of Laguna 
Beach and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what actually can come out of this meeting," said Irvine Co. 
spokesman Jim Barich. "I think we're just showing him the site. I don't think 
he's coming down here with any specific agenda." 
</P>
<P>
Some local officials criticized the upcoming Cranston visit as an attempt to 
bolster the senator's image, which has been tarnished recently by a scandal 
involving Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. Cranston and four other senators have 
been accused of interfering with a federal investigation of Lincoln in exchange 
for thousands of dollars in political contributions from owner Charles H. 
Keating Jr. The resulting collapse of the thrift resulted in a $2-billion loss 
for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Despite skepticism about Cranston's intentions, the senator's visit will help 
attract statewide attention to an environmental issue that so far has generated 
mostly local interest. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said he is sure Cranston is trying 
to improve his image, "but I don't mind if it helps us. There could be an 
important federal role there if we come up a little short, the feds might come 
in and use some of their federal park monies to help us. It's a long shot but 
we don't pass up long shots." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach City Council member Robert F. Gentry also welcomed the Cranston 
visit and encouraged other elected officials and candidates for office to tour 
the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"If his visit means there is a potential for preservation of Laguna Canyon by 
the federal government, then I'm elated," Gentry said. "It validates it as a 
regional and a national issue. The fact that he's here to review the site 
indicates to me that he is indeed interested in the future use of the land."

The drug-forfeiture program has become big business for Orange County law 
enforcement officials, who predict that police agencies in the county will 
divvy up nearly $35 million in cash confiscated so far in narcotics busts. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated $6 million of that amount has been allocated to the Sheriff's 
Department -- and the Board of Supervisors, often at odds with Sheriff-Coroner 
Brad Gates over budget matters, wants to know how the money is being spent. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1984 federal law, a portion of the money seized during drug 
investigations is returned to local law enforcement agencies to fight drug 
abuse. The county Regional Narcotics Suppression Program task force was formed 
in 1986 to take advantage of that law, and all but four of the county's smaller 
police departments participate in it and share in the proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has used its share of the money to pay for a 
presidential visit, a drug education program and a narcotics investigators' 
training facility. The regional task force has spent money on such items as 
office supplies, rental cars for investigators, overtime pay and helicopter 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
None of the supervisors have accused the sheriff or the task force of spending 
the money for non-drug-related items. 
</P>
<P>
But they have asked for a report outlining how the money is being spent and how 
police agencies in other counties are spending their drug money. The report, 
being prepared by the county administrative office, is due in late January and 
was ordered in October when Gates said he could not legally use the money to 
pay for the county's new genetics-testing laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we got to get a handle on it," Supervisor Don R. Roth said. "I'm in no 
way saying that there is anything wrong, but I think we need uniformity on how 
this money can be spent doing the most good. If something goes wrong, they 
won't run to the auditor or the sheriff, they'll come to the Board of 
Supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
Information Needed 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he knows of one police department that bought guns with the drug 
money while other departments use it only for drug enforcement. The supervisors 
should be fully informed on how the money is spent -- both by the sheriff's 
narcotics program and the regional task force, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four federal and county law enforcement agencies staff the task force, 
which does surveillance work, enlists informants and makes actual narcotics 
raids. 
</P>
<P>
The cash seized under the federal-forfeiture program comes back to the regional 
program headed by a 14-member executive board made up of local police chiefs, 
Gates and a variety of federal law enforcement officials. Some of the money is 
then redistributed to cities for use by their police departments. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government retains 10% of the seized drug money to administer the 
program and the regional task force keeps 25% to finance its operation. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Capt. Tim Simon, who heads the regional drug task force, said Monday 
that a total of $47 million had been confiscated since the regional anti-drug 
effort began in December, 1986, but $12 million of that was transferred to 
police agencies outside the county for participating in joint investigations. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Simon said, the regional task force has received $7.8 million and 
another $27.2 million is in "the pipeline." He said he did not know how long it 
would take for that money to make it through an "overburdened and bureaucratic" 
federal system. 
</P>
<P>
About $2 million of the $7.8 million has been disbursed to the Sheriff's 
Department, with local police departments getting another $4 million or so. 
</P>
<P>
Simon said the Sheriff's Department would eventually receive about $6 million 
of the $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing is that none of the money we spend comes from the county 
general fund," Simon said. "None of it is tax dollars. All the money is seized 
from major drug dealers." 
</P>
<P>
Major expenditures of the sheriff's drug-fighting money so far have included 
the launching of a countywide drug abuse education program along with nearly 
$350,000 to fix up the confiscated Rancho del Rio, a remote property near the 
Riverside County line which lawmen hope someday will become an international 
drug investigation training facility. 
</P>
<P>
The task force has had $1 million-plus seizures totaling 11, Simon said. During 
those drug raids, agents have confiscated 11,000 pounds of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The largest single seizure, of $5.2 million, came in early 1988 when regional 
narcotics agents raided residences in South Gate and Riverside. In addition to 
the cash, agents confiscated 18 pounds of heroin and arrested three Mexican 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
Simon said the county auditor-controller monitors expenditures by both the 
sheriff's narcotics program and the regional drug-fighting program. The 
regional task force is also subject to federal and state audits, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Surprise Audits 
</P>
<P>
Even the Sheriff's Department conducts surprise audits of the regional program, 
Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
Records at the auditor's office showed that much of the money spent by the 
regional task force went for day-to-day operations such as telephone bills, car 
rentals, overtime for agents, and, in some cases, office equipment and 
supplies. Bills for cellular car telephones used by drug investigators, 
informant payments and money used for drug buys are not itemized but are kept 
in what is called the 240 account. 
</P>
<P>
That account can run a balance up to $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rental car bills can run as high as $18,000 a month. Investigators change cars 
continuously to avoid detection by suspects, Simon explained. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not much glitzy stuff," Simon said, adding that the cars that the 
investigators drive are like the ones driven by the average person. But he 
added: "When we need a stretch limo or a big Mercedes, we can rent it." 
</P>
<P>
Monthly helicopter costs for the task force can run into the tens of thousands 
of dollars. Crowded freeways, officials said, have made the use of helicopters 
a must when following drug traffickers. Overtime for narcotics agents becomes a 
major expense because of long stakeouts during lengthy investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' use of the drug money also became a focus of controversy earlier this 
year when it was learned that he spent thousands -- the final bill was $335,061 
-- to pay for President Bush's visit to Rancho del Rio last April. The U.S. 
Justice Department determined that the financing of Bush's anti-drug speech was 
a proper use of the money, but Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said he and 
his colleagues "would have swallowed several times" had they known what the 
final cost would be. 
</P>
<P>
County auditor's records showed that $3,995 of the sheriff's drug-fighting 
money was used for a catered lunch at Rancho del Rio when the President visited 
while tens of thousands were used to paint, fix up, and re-grade the road to 
the remote ranch. Another auditor's item showed that $7,239.03 was paid to 
Abbey Party Rents Inc. to prepare for the Bush visit. 
</P>
<P>
Another $29,083 was paid to a lumber company and $64,942 to the Ortega Rock 
Quarry for improvements to the ranch road. 
</P>
<P>
Other bills paid out of the sheriff's program included $3,610 for rubbish 
removal, $750 for laser firearms fees and $259 for a rented trailer to haul 
furniture to Rancho del Rio.

2 BURGLARY SUSPECTS FLEE; LOOT RECOVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Monday chased two young men suspected of burglarizing a Westminster 
apartment, until the men abandoned their car and the stolen goods. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when neighbors reported two men in their 20s apparently 
stealing a television and videocassette recorder from an apartment in the 7200 
block of Trask Avenue at about 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Officers spotted the suspects, traveling in a gray Hyundai Excel, and gave 
chase, Sgt. Philip Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1100 block of Santa Maria Street in Stanton, the suspects stopped and 
fled from their car. Police recovered a television and VCR, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
The men remain at large.

WORKER COUNSELING PROGRAM HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If Buena Park employees need help with marital, family, alcohol or drug 
problems, or managing stress, they don't have to go far for help. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Larry Temple, director of administrative services, city employees 
have the benefit of a full-time psychologist 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Employees Assistance Program is one of only a few such plans in the 
county, and Rutgers University has chosen it as one of 25 programs nationwide 
to be honored for innovation and success. 
</P>
<P>
Temple and Dr. Tom Abbott, city psychologist, recently went to Rutgers to 
accept an award on behalf of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The program, begun in 1987, was a vision Temple had while working on the city 
police force in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the need," Temple said, referring to delayed stress syndrome, which is 
largely associated with police and fire department jobs. "It wasn't uncommon 
for a 35-year-old man to become an alcoholic, and lose everything because of 
the stress from the job." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott initially worked only with police officers, but the program caught on 
quickly and the city soon began to see a decline in early retirements and 
disability leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Temple was promoted to director of administration in 1987 and shortly 
thereafter began working on creating a program for all city employees and their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"What we wanted to achieve was a way to help employees continue to do their 
jobs at a satisfactory level during periods of personal difficulties," Temple 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has saved money through the program, Temple said. 
</P>
<P>
"For every $1 you spend on EAP, you get $4 back in hard dollars by reductions 
in absenteeism, utilization of health care, and disability retirements," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a 30-year-old police officer goes on disability retirement, the total 
long-range cost is estimated at $785,000," Temple said. "That's how much is 
saved every time such a retirement is prevented." 
</P>
<P>
Abbott, 47, a marriage, family and child therapist, says he is no stranger to 
the stress encountered by others. A recovering alcoholic, he decided to get 
into therapy himself, and from there has continually tried to help others. 
</P>
<P>
"My background gives me a level of understanding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott noted that one of the most successful factors of the program is the 
confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't keep individual case records, only a number count, without names," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said marital issues have been the most frequent reason for counseling, 
followed by emotional stress and parent-child problems. DEBORAH CARPENTIER

TRANSIT OFFICIALS DENIED TRAM FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a continuing financial battle over Laguna Beach's "cable car on wheels," 
Orange County transportation commissioners voted Monday to deny more than 
$300,000 to Laguna Beach Municipal Transit Lines. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in Santa Ana, Orange County Transportation Commission members said they 
were still unhappy with the Laguna Beach transit authority after an audit 
earlier this year showed poor cost-benefit performance. Also, the commission's 
staff was miffed over the transit line's decision to go ahead and buy a new 
tram to replace the distinctive blue, rusting "village trolley" -- against 
OCTC's advice. The staff had recommended leasing a vehicle or privatizing the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The trolley and three trams were used in prior years to shuttle summer visitors 
from Laguna Canyon to festivals and activities throughout the city. The system 
runs along Coast Highway, Laguna Canyon Road and other major streets to handle 
additional summer traffic. 
</P>
<P>
City transit officials were seeking $68,411 as reimbursement for the purchase 
of a new tram, and $240,000 for future vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
In May, OCTC rejected an earlier request for trolley replacement funds after 11 
summers of service, creating a public outcry in defense of the bus, designed to 
resemble a wooden-seated cable car. 
</P>
<P>
City officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
OCTC did approve $237,063 in other funding requests submitted by Laguna Beach 
on Monday, mostly for general transit line operating costs. Commission staff 
members said negotiations on future vehicle purchases will continue in a bid to 
resolve remaining issues. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

4 SANTA MAILBOXES WILL BE INSTALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four special-delivery mailboxes will be set up throughout the city this week 
for letters destined for Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
Elves doubling as Fullerton community-service workers will make certain that 
letters dropped off with a self-addressed stamped envelope receive a personal 
reply from Santa. 
</P>
<P>
The white metal mailboxes will be in place from Friday to Dec. 22 in the lobby 
of City Hall at 303 W. Commonwealth Ave., next door at the main library, the 
Hunt Branch Library at 201 S. Basque Ave., and Independence Park at 801 W. 
Valencia Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Special Santa-letter forms, available at the mailboxes, may be used to make 
writing the letter easier. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first year the city has set up mailboxes for Santa Claus, 
spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer Mudrick said.

FESTIVITIES TO HONOR MEXICO PATRON SAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Latinos across the county will gather at a dozen Catholic churches today to 
honor the patron saint of Mexico, Our Lady of Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
Before dawn, church members gather to hold lighted candles and sing 
"Mananitas," a serenade to the Lady of Guadalupe. The candles represent the 
light the Virgin Mary has given the Mexican people, said Sister Carmen Sarati 
from St. Joseph Church in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
After the Mananitas, a special Mass with mariachis is held. In the evening, the 
congregations have a procession in their neighborhoods in traditional dress. 
The processions lead to churches for another Mass, after which hot chocolate, 
Mexican sweetbread and tamales are served. 
</P>
<P>
Our Lady of Guadalupe festivities commemorate the day the Virgin Mary is 
believed to have appeared to Juan Diego, a poor Indian. According to the story, 
Diego was on his way to Tepeyac Hill, in what is now Mexico City, when the 
vision appeared on Dec. 9, 1531. The Lady told him to ask the bishop to build a 
shrine where she stood. But the bishop doubted Diego's story. On Dec. 12, the 
vision appeared again and told Diego to go to Tepeyac Hill and pick roses. The 
land on the hill was dry and cracked. The bishop said if Juan found the 
flowers, the bishop would believe him. Juan cut the flowers and placed them in 
his tilma, a cape-like garment, and went to show the bishop. As he unraveled 
the garment and laid the roses at the bishop's feet, the image of Our Lady of 
Guadalupe appeared on his cape. 
</P>
<P>
Another procession will be held Saturday from Santa Ana Stadium to downtown 
Santa Ana, when the Latino community celebrates Las Posadas. The candlelight 
procession symbolizes Joseph's and Mary's attempt to seek shelter before the 
birth of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
It will be led by Bishop Norman McFarland of the Diocese of Orange and will 
follow a three-hour Las Posadas celebration at the stadium, sponsored by the 
Santiago Club. 
</P>
<P>
The program, geared for children, will include dances, puppet shows and 
pinatas. About 40 volunteers from the Santiago Club have filled more than 1,000 
pinatas with candy, which, along with 5,000 toys, will be given to the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"This is also an affair that will be attended by many low-income families," 
said Rodolfo Montejano, chairman of the Santiago Club. "When you see smiles on 
the children with their pinatas and other holiday treats, you realize how 
wonderful it is to make Christmas a wonderful thing for young children." 
</P>
<P>
KVEA, Channel 52, will televise the program, which will also feature puppet 
shows, Disney characters and a variety of Mexican dance groups.STEPHEN C.

PEOPLE: TO GIRL SCOUTS, THEIR 'MIZ EM' IS A DIVINE LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She answers to the names Miz Em and Frankie. 
</P>
<P>
If you are one of her hundreds of present and former Girl Scouts or one of her 
five grown and married children, you call her Miz Em. 
</P>
<P>
But if you were one of the people who tangled with Francis Morse during her 
younger days "when I was the biggest tomboy in town," you called her Frankie, 
which has since become the term of affection for all who know her. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the name Miz Em," said Morse; "it fits me." 
</P>
<P>
Morse is a legend among the many women who were Girl Scouts in the troops she 
led. To show their appreciation, they toasted her with a "This Is Your Life" 
party recently. 
</P>
<P>
Tough as she might have been, Miz Em is a sweetie to the Senior Girl Scouts in 
Troop 1079 in Anaheim. And it's been that way for the 25 years she has served 
as a Girl Scout leader and adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"At the senior level we like to get away from the word leader, " said Morse, 
who retired a couple of years ago after 20 years as a legal secretary in the 
city attorney's office in Anaheim. "The girls pretty much run the troop." 
</P>
<P>
If anything rankles Miz Em, though, it's what she calls the unwarranted 
reputation assigned to Girl Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Scouts in the junior high school age group, she said, are saddled with 
reputations as goody-goodies and don't want to be seen in their uniforms. "They 
want to be accepted so badly. What friends think is so much more important than 
anything. But when it comes down to the nitty-gritty, they are really proud of 
their uniform." 
</P>
<P>
That's less of a problem with the seniors, she said. "They know who they are, 
but the scouts in junior high get a lot of pressure from those not in the 
movement who don't understand what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
As for how scouting has changed over the years, she said, "It isn't all peaches 
and cream today. You get a real cross section, and a lot of kids are from a 
single-parent family. 
</P>
<P>
"The newspapers are filled with the problems of the young today, but if any of 
our girls are having a problem we try to help them work it out." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Morse herself never became a Girl Scout, though she wanted to be 
one badly. 
</P>
<P>
"I was brought up during the Depression, and my family couldn't afford the dues 
or the uniform. It was a luxury they couldn't afford." 
</P>
<P>
But you can't keep her out of it now. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband (Al Morse) keeps asking me how long I'm going to do it," she said. 
"I tell him probably just a couple of more years, but it keeps going on." 
</P>
<P>
Working with her "young ladies," as Miz Em calls her troop members, is a 
refreshing experience. 
</P>
<P>
"You get to know the lingo and what's in today and out tomorrow," she said. "I 
like that, and they are all so bright." 
</P>
<P>
Except for being a wife and parent, she said, scouting has been the most 
fulfilling part of her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't give it up. I can't imagine what my life would be without it." 
</P>
<P>
Having a picture taken with Santa Claus is a big draw at the Laguna Hills Mall. 
But Jill Strief said mall officials weren't prepared for the number of people 
who wanted to get their pets into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing," said Strief, assistant marketing director for the mall and a 
Laguna Beach resident. "People were waiting in line 3 1/2 hours," she said. The 
mall had set aside a special three-hour block for the picture-taking sessions 
for pet owners. Most brought dogs, cats or birds, but two brought their pigs. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpectedly large response among pet owners means that the mall will 
probably revamp the program next Christmas, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pet owners paid $5 apiece for the Polaroid pictures; the money was donated to 
the San Clemente Animal Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
And these were no ordinary Santas. 
</P>
<P>
"They were veterinarians who donated their time," she said, adding, "it was so 
much fun." 
</P>
<P>
For $1,512 you can join Fullerton College photography instructor Al DeVito on a 
nine-day picture-taking excursion to Oahu, Maui, Hawaii and Kauai in early 
January. 
</P>
<P>
The subjects will include volcanoes, underwater environments, rain forests, 
bird sanctuaries and community life in non-tourist areas. 
</P>
<P>
But participants had better be prepared to rough it. Some of the lodging will 
be in tents.

FREEWAY TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS SKYROCKET; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: EVEN WITH PRESENT FREEWAY AND ROAD EXPANSION PLANS, TRAFFIC 
FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY COULD OVERLOAD THE SYSTEM BY 2010.

More than 400,000 vehicles a day may be using the Riverside Freeway into Orange 
County by the year 2010, a 50% increase over previous county forecasts, 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic volume on the Orange Freeway is also expected to be 50% greater than 
county officials had previously projected, with about 306,000 daily trips 
expected 20 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
County Environmental Management Agency Director Ernie Schneider called the new 
traffic forecasts alarming, pointing out that such staggering volumes of 
traffic would overload the system of roads and freeways now being planned for 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
During an hourlong press conference at the Hall of Administration, Schneider 
and other county officials labeled the new projections a "warning signal" for 
local elected leaders and residents alike. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happening is that we're being impacted by areas that we have no control 
over," Schneider said, pointing in particular to the hordes of motorists who 
each day drive from Riverside County to jobs in Orange County. "This really 
raises the flag of regionalism." 
</P>
<P>
But some officials contacted after the press conference said the new forecasts 
should come as little surprise. For several years, they noted, officials of the 
Southern California Assn. of Governments have been voicing similar dire 
predictions about the growth of traffic in Orange County. But county traffic 
prognosticators have insisted that the SCAG figures were exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County Transportation 
Commission, said that county traffic planners "should be embarrassed" by the 
new numbers for the two freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"They have finally come around to SCAG's numbers," Oftelie said. "But the big 
question is, what's to be done about it." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth agreed that the county's previous projections were 
"ludicrous," but he said he found little solace in assessing blame. 
</P>
<P>
"The spinoff of all this is an increase from month to month in the number of 
people using side streets," Roth said. "It's scary as hell. That's why we have 
to look at alternatives such as monorails and people-movers, ideas that will 
get people out of the automobile." 
</P>
<P>
The new traffic projections for the Riverside and Orange freeways spring from 
an upgraded computer study just completed by county transportation planners. 
The new projections incorporate much more data than previous studies performed 
by Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
A 1985 study by the county predicted that 237,000 vehicles would use the 
Riverside Freeway daily in 2010. The new computer study puts the number at 
400,000; about 188,000 vehicles now use the freeway each day. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 study found that traffic on the Orange Freeway would rise from the 
current 174,000 vehicles a day to 208,000 by 2010. But the new study forecasts 
that traffic volume on the freeway will reach 306,000 cars and trucks a day. 
</P>
<P>
The mammoth new traffic volumes reflect a continuing trend -- an increase in 
the number of jobs throughout central Orange County, while Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties remain a burgeoning cluster of bedroom communities 
exporting workers. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Riverside and Orange counties have become economically dependent 
on one another, underlining the need for adequate transportation systems 
linking the two areas, officials said during the press conference.

CRIME, TRAFFIC FEARS CITED AT HEARING ON SPORTS ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A handful of neighbors in the area of the proposed Santa Ana indoor sports 
arena said Monday that the 20,000-seat facility will cause traffic, crime and 
other nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Ana needs an arena like it needs a hole in the head," said Shirley 
Gates, who owns property in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Gates was one of four people who spoke against the proposed arena at a public 
hearing Monday night before the Santa Ana Planning Commission. Gates and her 
husband, Niles, who manages several industrial buildings near the Edinger 
Avenue and Lyon Street intersection where the arena is proposed, said rock 
concerts at the facility will chase away local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Other business owners also said the arena would increase traffic and attract 
unsavory characters to the largely industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental report prepared for the arena's private developers, Spectacor 
Management Group and MCA Entertainment, projected that Santa Ana's arena would 
create significant traffic congestion when events begin or end during rush 
hour. But the $75-million facility will provide 244 more jobs and "visually 
attractive" new buildings, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana and Anaheim each hope that building an arena will lure a professional 
basketball or hockey franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Although the National Basketball Assn. has no plans for expansion in the near 
future, the National Hockey League's board of governors decided last weekend to 
add up to seven franchises by the end of the century and three teams by the 
1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana arena is projected to open in August or September, 1992. 
Construction is scheduled to begin on June 1, 1990, on 17 vacant acres at the 
southeast corner of Edinger and Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anaheim officials estimate that ground can be broken for their own 
20,000-seat, $85-million arena in January and construction completed by fall of 
1991. It is to be built on land purchased by the city next to a mobile home 
park on Douglass Road, north of Katella Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
But the environmental report for the Anaheim arena has drawn criticism for 
downplaying traffic, noise and pollution effects of that city's arena. 
</P>
<P>
Residents opposed to noise and traffic were instrumental in defeating previous 
proposals for sports arenas in Santa Ana and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Stanaland, president of Campanula Properties, owner of the Orangetree 
Mobile Home Park on Douglass Road, northwest of the stadium, criticized the 
Anaheim report and said he is prepared to go to court to challenge the 
document. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city rushed the report in order to begin construction before the 
Santa Ana arena. 
</P>
<P>
California Angels Executive Vice President Michael Schreter also maintains that 
Anaheim's environmental report does not adequately consider increased traffic 
that will occur when events are held simultaneously at the stadium and arena. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic in the vicinity of that intersection (Katella and Douglass) and 
backing up onto the 57 (Orange) Freeway, will be terrible, if not gridlocked," 
Schreter said. "We are concerned . . . for the safety and convenience of our 
fans." 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim City Council is scheduled to consider approval of the report 
Friday. The report must be approved before construction can begin.

COACH AGREES HE BROKE RULE, BUT QUESTIONS HIS PUNISHMENT

DANA POINT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 3:02 on a December afternoon, Rich Skelton was sitting in the social science 
department office at Dana Hills High School. He was a little uneasy and a bit 
pensive as he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 26 years, Skelton was not conducting a basketball 
practice on a December afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Skelton was suspended for one year by Capistrano Unified School District 
officials in June because he had contact with a parent before his son, a 
basketball player, was enrolled at Dana Hills, which is a violation of Southern 
Section rule 510 regarding undue influence. 
</P>
<P>
Skelton also allowed the player to live at his house during a three-week 
period, from late September to mid-October. Although that alone is not a 
violation, the question was raised by the Southern Section as to when Skelton 
agreed to house the student. 
</P>
<P>
Skelton admits breaking the rule, although he said he was unaware that he had 
done so at the time. It's the punishment that he doesn't agree with. 
</P>
<P>
"When the rule was spelled out to me, I said, 'Yes, I broke it,' " said 
Skelton, who has coached at Dana Hills for one season. "But I didn't break the 
intent of the rule. In this sense, the punishment doesn't fit the crime." 
</P>
<P>
The case is unique because it was the parent of the player who turned Skelton 
in and later testified against him in a session with Southern Section 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Vivona, whose son played for Dana Hills last season, contacted Southern 
Section officials last season after he discovered that Skelton had violated the 
rule. Why he did it is open to debate. 
</P>
<P>
Skelton said Vivona was angry because his son, John, did not receive enough 
playing time. Skelton also said Tony Vivona threatened to turn him in if his 
son did not play more. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that as far as I knew, I was within Southern Section rules," said 
Skelton, who is a history teacher at Dana Hills. "I also told him he was more 
than welcome to check with the Southern Section." 
</P>
<P>
Vivona's version differs. He said he called Southern Section officials after 
friends told him Skelton might have violated rules by housing his son. 
</P>
<P>
But Vivona learned of the violation when he talked with Skelton in August, 
before his son's enrollment at Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Vivona said he told Skelton in January that he was going to the Southern 
Section, but he didn't use it as a threat. Vivona also said that had his son 
received more playing time, he would not have filed a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I would have let it go," said Vivona, who has moved back to Texas. "But 
he played less. I felt it was a disservice to my son. His whole life was 
crumbling." 
</P>
<P>
In April 1988, Vivona moved to California from Woodlands, a suburb of Houston. 
He had been contracted to work as an engineer for a company in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Vivona rented a room in Dana Point and, during the summer, decided he would 
move his family to California. Because his son was a basketball player, he 
contacted Skelton. 
</P>
<P>
"The first question I asked him was, 'Where do you live?' " Skelton said. "He 
told me the address, which was within the Dana Hills attendance area." 
</P>
<P>
If Skelton had then referred Vivona to a Dana Hills administrator, there would 
have been no violation. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like the kid was coming from a school in the area," Skelton said. "I 
don't like talking to kids from another coach's program." 
</P>
<P>
But because Vivona was from Texas and was living within the Dana Hills' 
boundary, Skelton said he didn't believe there was anything wrong with talking 
to Vivona. They had between five and 10 conversations before school started, 
according to Skelton. 
</P>
<P>
"He said his son was an outstanding basketball player," Skelton said. "I had 
this little thought in my mind that maybe we were going to get a good transfer 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after school began, John Vivona moved into Skelton's house. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Vivona's wife and family was still living in Woodlands at the time. John 
came to live with his father in late August. 
</P>
<P>
"Skelton kept bugging me to get my son out here," Vivona said. "But I hadn't 
found a place for my family to live. I was still staying in a room in Laguna 
Niguel. He said he would let John live with him." 
</P>
<P>
Skelton said he only agreed to let Vivona's son move in after he had enrolled 
at Dana Hills. And he did so only because John Vivona had no place to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid was carrying a heavy academic load," Skelton said. "He didn't have a 
place to study and was sleeping on the floor. The father told me they were 
going to get a place over the weekend, so I said the kid could come stay at my 
house." 
</P>
<P>
Vivona stayed three weeks, Skelton said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an inconvenience, but I wanted to help the kid," Skelton said. "The 
father even brought his dog over one night and wanted to know if I knew of a 
place he could keep it. We called a few places, but we couldn't find a place. 
So I told him he could keep it at my house for a couple of days. The dog barked 
the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
Skelton said it was apparent from the beginning that Vivona had exaggerated 
about his son's abilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I could tell from the first couple of days of practice that he wasn't going to 
be an impact player," said Skelton, who has been a head coach at Workman, San 
Clemente and Grand Island (Neb.) high schools and was an assistant at 
Saddleback College before coming to Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
John Vivona, who is 6-feet-6, was a starter for the sophomore team at 
McCullough High in Woodlands. However, he couldn't crack the starting lineup at 
Dana Hills and became a seldom-used reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the second-tallest player on the team and should have had more playing 
time," Vivona said. "I think someone who is tall has the capability of doing a 
little more in basketball than someone who is shorter." 
</P>
<P>
This season, John Vivona is again playing for McCullough. Terry Priest, the 
team's coach, said Vivona plays about five minutes a game and is averaging 
fewer than two points. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a difficult time playing for us," Priest said. "He's very slow and he 
doesn't jump well. He has improved since he was here as a sophomore, but his 
reactions are not what they need to be in order to become a good player." 
</P>
<P>
After the 1988-89 season, Dana Hills officials received word that the Southern 
Section was investigating Skelton. According to Skelton, a "fact-finding" 
hearing was held, during which Southern Section officials produced a letter 
written by Tony Vivona. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the letter was to show there was undue influence," Skelton 
said. "It was filled with truths, half-truths and things that were entirely 
false. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole gist was to show that it was my intent to recruit this boy and keep 
him from going somewhere else. My feeling was, I found out right away that the 
kid couldn't play and I still helped him. To me, it was the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
John Smart, Dana Hills principal, said he first was going to only reprimand 
Skelton. However, Southern Section officials said that was not enough. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to be consistent with previous cases," Smart said. "I have a high 
opinion of Rich. I've known him for 15 years and I know he wasn't trying to 
circumvent the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"The father wasn't doing this out of some moral principle. If Rich would have 
played his son, he wouldn't have gone to the Southern Section." 
</P>
<P>
And Skelton would be leading a basketball practice now. Still, life without 
basketball hasn't been so bad. 
</P>
<P>
Skelton is taking classes to learn more about the real estate business and has 
devoted time to such hobbies as fishing and hunting. He even has trained two 
hunting dogs, which he said is a lot like coaching basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the dogs) have the instincts, but you have to teach them," Skelton said. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there is more time to be with his family. 
</P>
<P>
The free time Skelton has to spend with his daughter and son has allowed his 
wife to go back to school. Sharon Skelton is working on a master's degree in 
psychology. 
</P>
<P>
But even with all that, there is a void. After 25 years in the business, 12 of 
which have been spent as a head coach, Skelton misses basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly there are some things I don't miss," he said. "There are a lot of 
problems that come with being a coach. But I do miss being on the floor with 
the players. It's the best part about coaching."

ACQUISITION GROUP TO PUMP $15.4 MILLION INTO HAWAIIAN AIRLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The investment group seeking to acquire Hawaiian Airlines has altered its 
purchase agreement in order to pump an additional $15.4 million of working 
capital into the financially ailing carrier. 
</P>
<P>
J. Thomas Talbot, the Newport Beach attorney heading the investment group, also 
said Monday that the acquisition of the airline holding company, HAL Inc. of 
Honolulu, is expected to be completed Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
The $22-per-share acquisition price has not been changed. The Talbot group will 
pay $27.4 million if the minimum number of shares are tendered, or $41.8 
million if all 1.9 million shares outstanding are offered. 
</P>
<P>
The amended deal, disclosed Monday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, calls for the investment group -- which includes former baseball 
commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth -- to swap a new class of preferred stock for 
700,000 shares of HAL common stock held by the company's current chairman, 
73-year-old John H. Magoon Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The new terms, agreed upon by both sides, would make the $15.4 million 
previously earmarked for the purchase of Magoon's stock available for working 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
Magoon would still receive nearly $9 million for 400,000 additional shares. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot said Monday that terms were changed because of the "deteriorating 
financial condition" of the airline in recent months. For the third quarter, 
the airline showed net earnings of $324,000, down 31% from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2 1/2 years before the Talbot group launched its acquisition bid on Aug. 
21, HAL lost more than $30 million. And while it reported a profit in the third 
quarter this year, it was lower than usual in what traditionally is the 
industry's best period. 
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the purchase and the group's merger into HAL, the merged 
company would swap 154,000 shares of newly authorized series B preferred stock 
to Magoon for the 700,000 shares of the common stock. The Talbot group would 
then purchase the $15.4 million worth of common stock from the company. 
</P>
<P>
While the non-voting preferred shares would be redeemable at $100 per share, 
Magoon would not be able to cash them in for at least 10 years, although they 
could be called in by the company at any time. 
</P>
<P>
The Talbot group, in its SEC filing, said that 695,000 shares -- more than 
enough to satisfy its minimum demand -- had been tendered Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific Bank has agreed to provide loans totaling $101 million to 
finance the acquisition and provide post-acquisition working capital for the 
carrier.

DOUGLAS' DELTA II LAUNCHES AIR FORCE NAVIGATION SATELLITE 
</P>

<P>
A Delta II rocket blasted off Monday and put a $65-million Air Force navigation 
satellite into orbit, marking McDonnell Douglas' eighth commercial rocket 
launch of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Delta II is built by McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. in Huntington 
Beach. McDonnell Douglas is building 18 of the Delta II rockets for the Air 
Force, at a cost of about $50 million each, to launch Navstar navigation 
satellites designed to pinpoint within 50 feet the location of military troops 
and vehicles anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
A McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman said the company has executed more commercial 
launches this year than its competition. McDonnell Douglas' main competitors in 
the commercial rocket business are General Dynamics, Martin Marietta and the 
European consortium Arianespace. 
</P>
<P>
The Navstar launch was the fifth of 18 satellites that the Air Force plans to 
place into orbit by the mid-1990s as part of a worldwide navigation system. The 
satellites are built by Rockwell International's Satellite and Space 
Electronics Division in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Delta launch was originally scheduled Sunday but was canceled because of a 
scratched helium regulator that would have prevented the rocket's second-stage 
engine from igniting. Technicians fixed the problem Sunday night by installing 
a relief valve in the helium system, which is used to pressurize the 
second-stage fuel tanks.

Tighter Management: Distributed Logic Corp. said Monday that it has made 
organizational changes intended to streamline its worldwide operations. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim company said the moves are designed to provide "tighter, more 
responsive management control on a regional basis." 
</P>
<P>
Under the restructuring, Distributed Logic formed operating units for its 
Pacific Rim, European and Canadian operations. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the need for the reorganization became apparent after it 
acquired Plessey Peripheral Systems subsidiaries in 1987 and began to merge 
that operation into the rest of its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"These new operating units will provide more local control over engineering, 
manufacturing, sales, marketing and administrative activities," said company 
Chairman Glenn C. Salley. 
</P>
<P>
Distributed Logic said it has promoted Jon C. Klotz, formerly senior vice 
president of operations, to president and chief operating officer of European 
operations. Andrew Betterton, formerly president of Canadian operations for the 
Plessey business, has been promoted to president of Dilog Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said it has hired John F. Wilson to serve as president and 
chief operating officer of its U.S. operations.

O.C. THEATERALTERNATIVE REPERTORY CONJURES UP 'A CHRISTMAS MEMORY' REAL AS LIFE

Most theater in Orange County, like most theater anywhere, is based on the art 
of illusion. The players make the audience believe, to a greater or lesser 
degree, that what it is seeing on stage is somehow real. This holds true across 
the entire theatrical spectrum, from William Shakespeare to Neil Simon. 
</P>
<P>
Such an illusional art almost always requires the technical support of scene 
designers and costume-makers, lighting engineers and sound technicians. And yet 
this conspiracy of make-believe need not depend on anything more elaborate than 
a bare space to succeed, so long as the players are able to transform mere 
words and gestures into feeling. It takes a certain talent for that, of course, 
but also a conviction that transmutes emotion into art. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Alternative Repertory Theatre has had a struggle to achieve this 
sort of effect. The storefront troupe time and again has conjured an atmosphere 
of make-believe only to fall short of a more solid result. Valiant players have 
pretended with all their might, as though effort could substitute for 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
But it is a pleasure at last to report that ART has come into its own, with a 
staged reading of Truman Capote's "A Christmas Memory." This graceful, intimate 
offering rings as true as life itself and ought not to be missed. Beautifully 
played on an empty stage by Barbara Sorenson and Lee Clark, it caps a heartfelt 
evening of Christmas tales. 
</P>
<P>
The duo's performance also represents a giant stride toward maturity for a 2 
1/2-year-old company still learning to balance artistic strengths against 
weaknesses in a tiny playing space where false notes are magnified and easily 
detected. Under Joel T. Cotter's skillful direction, Sorenson and Clark take us 
straight to a country kitchen in the rural South without need of anything 
except their own delicate and unadorned acting. 
</P>
<P>
They draw us into Capote's reminiscence about his boyhood friendship with a 
cousin in her 60s no less imaginatively than a full-blown production could. 
Theirs is make-believe of a high order, so richly textured and vivid that you 
forget they are merely enacting a narrative. You can taste the whiskey-laced 
fruitcakes that Capote's cousin makes for Christmas, and feel the tug of that 
"lost pair of kites hurrying toward heaven." 
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to "A Christmas Memory," other members of the ART ensemble -- 
garbed in sweaters and scarfs and seated on stools -- read a nicely paced 
selection of five other seasonal stories ranging from the traditional (Charles 
Dickens and O. Henry) to the offbeat (Jonathan Winters and Steve Martin). The 
anthology is amusing, unpretentious and imbued with warmth. 
</P>
<P>
That ART regards this presentation of readings as a casual production, not to 
be rated alongside its more ambitious efforts, is understandable. However, the 
care that has gone into this charming evening is evident, and the payoff large. 
</P>
<P>

JAZZ BUTCHER BLASTS OUT GLIB, FAMILIAR SLICES OF BRITISH LIFE 
</P>

If names told the whole story, the Jazz Butcher could be a pretty tremendous 
group. Suggesting as it does the savaging of a rich and varied art form, the 
title well might lead one to expect some pretty impressive rubble to be left in 
this band's wake. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, in a world where governments can't even get accurate labeling from the 
food industry, it may be some time before we get around to truth-in-advertising 
legislation for rock acts. At the Coach House on Sunday evening, Britain's Jazz 
Butcher neither carved up the past with any particular flair nor did it create 
much of anything new. 
</P>
<P>
Singer/rhythm guitarist Pat Fish, a.k.a. the Jazz Butcher, deserves some points 
for endurance: Since 1982's "A Bath in Bacon" album his act has weathered 
numerous personnel changes, shrinking to a solo or duo at stages. Even the 
lineup he had Sunday -- with drummer Paul Mulreany, bassist Laurence O'Keefe 
and guitarist Richard Fromby -- was missing two of the participants from this 
year's "Big Planet, Scarey Planet" album. 
</P>
<P>
If Fish's music hasn't suffered overmuch from its changing players, it may be 
because it might not aspire to much in the first place. To Fish's credit, the 
set's 20 glibly worded songs flew fast and furious, but they didn't fly very 
far, being hampered by Fish's one-dimensional voice and a song construction 
that often relied on just bashing out one or two chords. 
</P>
<P>
On certain numbers, the band was very effective within those limitations, but 
spread throughout the performance, one tended to peg Fish -- despite a 
winningly manic stage manner -- as a small contender in an already crowded sea. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his songs are rooted in the vagaries of British life, but they largely 
lack the insight and humanity, not to mention compositional gift, of XTC's Brit 
portraits, and Fish's whimsy falls far short of Robyn Hitchcock's quirky 
explorations. 
</P>
<P>
Though diminished by the similarity of the show's material, Fish and Co. did 
have some semi-splendid moments, particularly on the uproarious, frantic 
one-chord rap of "Chickentown," the muscular pop of "Burglar of Love," the 
humorous take on the changing East in "Moscow Drug Club" and on two songs 
dating from his first album. 
</P>
<P>
One, the updated "Sex Engine Thing," goofily posited the august members of the 
Traveling Wilburys as "sex engines," while "Zombie Love" built to a 
sufficiently thrashing two-chord "Pushin' Too Hard"-like finale, aided by Downy 
Mildew's Charlie Baldonado on guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Except that they might lack Fish's self-assurance, Downy Mildew, the locals who 
opened the show, would be just as well placed as headliners. 
</P>
<P>
The quartet's engaging harmonies and arrangements -- favorably recalling 10,000 
Maniacs at times -- call for only a bit more drive and personality to make this 
a truly potent band.

MUSIC: FUSION BAND COMBINES LATIN RHYTHMS WITH ASIAN INSTRUMENTATION AND ROCK

<P>
Hiroshima is a true fusion band: Not only does it combine rock rhythms with 
jazz sensibilities, it moves across cultural boundaries, bringing traditional 
Japanese instruments and phrasing to its contemporary pop direction. 
</P>
<P>
The group's performance Sunday before an enthusiastic audience at the Celebrity 
Theatre showed why this mixture has worked so well through six albums. It also 
pointed out some limitations. 
</P>
<P>
The core of Hiroshima consists of Johnny Mori on percussion and taiko (large, 
festival drums), June Kuramoto on koto, Dan Kuramoto on flute, saxophones and 
keyboards, drummer Danny Yamamoto and vocalist Machun. Add bass, guitar, 
another keyboardist, another percussionist and a couple of backup singers, and 
one gets an idea of how big a sound this band can generate. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the tunes heard Sunday were from the band's recent release "East," a 
proclaimed "celebration of America's greatest resource, the cultural diversity 
of its people." Dan Kuramoto, who was born in East L.A., spoke a couple of 
times on this theme during the show to great applause. But the most impressive 
statement was made by the music, which combined Latin rhythms with Asian 
instrumentation and rock attack. 
</P>
<P>
The group's unique sound depends on this instrumentation. Mori added percussive 
depth with the taiko while adding emphatic clacks from the drum's rim. His 
unaccompanied solo built slowly until he was whirling between the two drums 
with a dancer's grace while beating out an involved, funky backbeat. 
</P>
<P>
Or take the koto, the Japanese string instrument that looks like a bloated 
guitar and is played in the horizontal position with movements that suggest the 
weaving of cloth. Most of us in this country are familiar with its fragile, 
considered sound through advertisements in which it is used to suggest our 
stereotype of traditional Japan. 
</P>
<P>
In the hands of June Kuramoto (and sufficiently amplified), the koto rocked out 
with authority, and provided a sweet touch to ballads. On her own "I've Been 
Here Before," Kuramoto plucked out the theme emphatically, adding trills and 
harplike embellishments. 
</P>
<P>
But she had little time to display the instrument's delicacy. Though it easily 
could be heard above the guitars and keyboards, one wonders how much of the 
koto's inflection was lost because of amplification. More time should be given 
Kuramoto to continue her slow-hand explorations. 
</P>
<P>
Vocalist Machun, who occasionally strapped on a guitar to rock along with 
sure-footed bassist Dean Cortez, showed a wide range and plenty of strength but 
little character to go with it. Her best moments were on "Thousand Cranes" 
(dedicated to a young victim of the Hiroshima bombing) and a funkified "I'll Be 
Home for Christmas," which featured Dan Kuramoto on soprano saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboardist Kimo Cornwell took the evening's most harmonically interesting 
solo, sounding at times like a young Herbie Hancock. Drummer Yamamoto showed 
agility and drive without overpowering the proceedings. The percussive mix (and 
cosmopolitan makeup of the band) benefitted from the addition of Luis Conte, 
whose conga playing was a pleasant counterpoint to Mori's taiko. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a fair balance of ballads and hard-hitting rockers, some of the 
material began to sound familiar as the show wore on. Still, as further 
explorations of the cultures embraced by this band yield new musical ideas, 
Hiroshima well could set the pace for fusion bands in the '90s.

DUO VOICE MESSAGE WITH HUMOR, CANDOR;

PERFORMANCE: SINGERS ROMANOVSKY &amp; PHILLIPS, WHO PLAYED TO A CHEERING IRVINE

Paul Phillips waltzed on stage at UC Irvine on Sunday night wearing a skintight 
miniskirt, garters that gripped thigh-high white hose, one rhinestone earring 
and three strands of pearls -- typical garb for a member of Romanovsky &amp; 
Phillips, an openly gay duo who sing of closet homosexuals, AIDS and sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
With gusto, the couple chanted: "Give me a guy who's glad to be gay!" 
</P>
<P>
With sober sincerity they harmonized: "Stand by the living and remain unified." 
</P>
<P>
With political zeal, they intoned: "It's not right to legislate how we make 
love." 
</P>
<P>
Pretty daring stuff for Orange County -- particularly for Irvine, where voters 
last month repealed an ordinance outlawing discrimination against homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
Romanovsky &amp; Phillips, whose candid, often humorous, sometimes poignant 
songs about homosexual life have placed them at the forefront of gay-oriented 
music, are acutely aware of the county's fierce anti-gay sentiments. They 
appeared at Santa Ana's recent Gay Pride Festival, and afterward "we were 
sitting in our car at a stoplight," Ron Romanovsky said after Sunday's show. 
"And someone walked by and said: 'There's a car full of disease-carrying 
perverts.' We sing about that kind of thing all the time, but to come so 
face-to-face with it . . . it was really scary." 
</P>
<P>
"It scares me that that attitude of hatred is so tolerated here," guitarist 
Phillips said. "There are places in this world where people think those types 
of things, but would never say them." 
</P>
<P>
But the singer/songwriters, at the end of a 40-state tour, say that their 
message of gay pride and unity goes further in such conservative pockets as 
Orange County or Amarillo, Tex., where they played last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The (gay) people living and staying here to improve things are very 
courageous," said Romanovsky, who plays guitar and piano. "We want to give them 
a shot in the arm." 
</P>
<P>
They seemed to succeed Sunday: The crowd of about 200 laughed raucously at the 
duo's trademark on-stage antics (Phillips described his miniskirt and pearls 
outfit as "Barbara Bush meets Cher") and stood and cheered as the concert 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
The show was a benefit for the UC Irvine Gay and Lesbian Student Union and the 
Orange County Visibility League, another gay activist group. "We're glad to be 
here to help OCVL," Romanovsky told the audience. "It's been crazy with Measure 
N and all," he said, referring to the recent Irvine vote. 
</P>
<P>
Romanovsky, 30, who writes most of the duo's music and lyrics, and Phillips, 
35, began singing together shortly after they met and became romantically 
involved in San Francisco in 1981. At UC Irvine, they performed several songs 
from three albums recorded on their own label -- Fresh Fruit Records -- as well 
as newer material that bespeaks their breakup 17 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no good for you, or maybe nobody's good enough for me," went one song 
about the pain of lost love. Another caustic tune, written during an earlier 
separation, found a scorned lover advising his former boyfriend to take a nice 
long trip -- a guilt trip, "all expenses paid." 
</P>
<P>
The duo, who are about to leave for Australia for their first engagement out of 
North America, don't just write songs about gay issues; songs about politics, 
for instance, also figure into the mix. But in any case, they feel their music 
has universal appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, Bill Savage of Fullerton, who attended with his wife, Catherine, 
said he enjoyed Sunday's show and would see Romanovsky &amp; Phillips again. "I 
just thought it was really neat the way they got their message across," he 
said. "It showed individuality."

<P>
A weeping "Hotel Queen" Leona Helmsley was sentenced today to four years in 
prison for cheating the government of $1.2 million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley, who once boasted to a housemaid that "only the little people pay 
taxes," was also ordered by U.S. District Judge John M. Walker to pay a 
$7.1-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
"No person, no matter how wealthy and prominent, stands above the law," Walker 
said. He said "naked greed" prompted her to evade income taxes by billing her 
hotel empire for personal items. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also imposed 750 hours of community service at Hale House, a home for 
drug-addicted children, three years probation and repayment of close to $2 
million in unpaid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley, whose glitzy ads portrayed her as a gracious hostess offering 
perfection in hotel service but whose enemies described her as a haughty, harsh 
and hotheaded tyrant, was allowed to remain free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
With her husband, Harry, Helmsley operates a $5-billion New York hotel and real 
estate empire. 
</P>
<P>
In a sobbing appeal for leniency before sentencing, Helmsley said she has been 
humiliated beyond imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"I am more humiliated than anyone could ever imagine. . . . I feel I am in the 
middle of a nightmare," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm sorry," she told an unmoved judge. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley, 69, was found guilty last August of writing off a wide variety of 
personal items as business expenses, including bras, shoes and dresses, 
groceries, a $1-million swimming pool cover that doubled as a marble dance 
floor, jade figures worth $500,000, and a $130,000 stereo system. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Helmsley, 80, had been charged with the same tax offenses as his wife but 
at age 80 was ruled not mentally fit to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
His wife could have received up to 127 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Leona Helmsley, who wore a high-necked black dress, said she and her husband 
had been kept prisoners for the three years of the case, afraid to go to a film 
or a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
She said their private lives have been violated to the extent that her son 
Jay's grave in Florida has been dug up. 
</P>
<P>
"I beg you, don't let me lose Harry too," she said, sobbing, her cheeks flushed 
and stained with tears. "Our whole life has been work and each other. Please 
don't. We have nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Helmsley sat in a third-row seat and seemed to nod off several times 
during his wife's appeal but he looked alert when the sentence was passed. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, after listening to the two-minute appeal for leniency, passed sentence, 
saying she had shown no remorse. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley was found guilty of evading federal taxes from 1983 through 1985, most 
of it by fraudulently billing $3.1 million in expenses from the Helmsleys' 
Greenwich, Conn., mansion to their real estate empire. 
</P>
<P>
Two former Helmsley executives also were sentenced for helping in the tax fraud 
scheme. Co-defendant Joseph Licari received 30 months in prison, three years 
probation and a $75,000 fine. Co-defendant Frank Turco received a two-year 
term, three years probation and a $50,000 fine.

A brush fire charred about 15 acres near the Simi Valley Freeway in Chatsworth 
early today before it was controlled, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 4:13 a.m. just north of the freeway near De Soto 
Avenue, said Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells. 
</P>
<P>
It took 35 firefighters, assisted by three water-dropping helicopters, about 30 
minutes to put out the blaze, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries and no structures were threatened, he said. The cause of 
the fire is under investigation.

A Taiwanese man who came to the United States to visit his pregnant daughter 
was shot and killed when gunmen opened fire in an apparent gang retaliation on 
the wrong apartment, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Lin Chin Chuan, 58, died at 8:45 a.m. at County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center 
where he had been on life-support systems since he was shot in the head late 
Monday night, detective Larry Kallestad said. 
</P>
<P>
Lin and his wife had been in the country only 18 days to be with their daughter 
when she gives birth. They were visiting their daughter and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents had been practicing driving the daughter to the hospital in 
anticipation of the imminent birth," Kallestad said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that the gunmen were gang members who attacked the wrong 
apartment in an apparent retaliatory "hit" for a gang shooting that occurred 
nearby about 90 minutes earlier. Three boys, aged 10 to 13, were wounded in the 
earlier attack.

Tennessee Secretary of State Gentry Crowell, whose office is at the center of a 
charity bingo scandal, shot himself in the mouth today in a suicide attempt, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Crowell, 57, was in stable condition at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 
Nashville, where he was taken for surgery to remove a bullet in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
Medical Service Capt. Mike Johnson said Crowell was found on his front porch by 
his son; a .38-caliber pistol was nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service, FBI and Tennessee Bureau of Investigation in 1986 
began an investigation of alleged bribery and skimming of profits because of 
reports that bingo operators were paying state officials to ignore violations 
of laws regulating the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Crowell has testified twice before federal grand juries investigating alleged 
bingo corruption. He has not been implicated in the scandal.

Sipping champagne, former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos held court in a 
San Jose restaurant, three months before her U.S. District Court trial on 
charges that she fraudulently bought U.S. properties with funds plundered from 
the Philippine treasury. 
</P>
<P>
The Monday night affair was reportedly her first public appearance since the 
Sept. 28 death of her husband in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
In a restaurant owned by her former palace caterer, Del Garcia, the former 
First Lady, still dressed in black and surrounded by hundreds of admirers, 
dined on Swedish meatballs and fancy vegetables at a hastily arranged 
testimonial. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, 60, flew into San Francisco last weekend for a holiday visit with her 
daughters, Irene and Amy, both of whom live in the city with their families. 
</P>
<P>
After the dinner, she entertained guests with two traditional Philippine love 
songs, accompanied by a cassette tape. At her side was her son, Ferdinand Jr., 
known as Bong-Bong, who did a rendition of "Misty." His supporters hope he will 
assume the Philippine presidency someday in Malacanang Palace.

<P>
In a Parliament that was once low-tech and rubber-stamp, a computerized voting 
system got off to a bumpy start today. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had to explain the system three times before the 
2,106 attending members of the Congress of People's Deputies got it right. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies were to insert their identity cards into hand-held vote-counters, 
press a button to register their names, then press another button indicating 
"yes," "no" or "abstain" before handing the machine to the next person. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev first asked the deputies to simply register their names. The result 
was 333 for, 11 against and 6 abstentions. The remaining 1,756 apparently 
pushed no button at all. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev explained the system again, and the second time, 1,985 names were 
recorded. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe some people still have to learn, but we are on the right track," he 
said.

'NOT AT WAR,' FISHERMAN SAYS AFTER FACE-OFF AT SEA

Coast Guard officials boarded an American fishing boat and questioned the 
captain today after the vessel collided with a Canadian destroyer and drew 
warning shots from the warship in a dispute over fishing rights. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation Monday began after the scalloper Concordia allegedly was 
spotted fishing 2.5 miles inside Canadian waters, Coast Guard Petty Officer 
Ellen Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
The fishing boat's captain, William Fuery, said this morning that his charts 
indicated he was never in Canadian waters. He said that the destroyer rammed 
his vessel and that when the warship began its pursuit, he fled in fear. 
</P>
<P>
"A plane told me to stop my vessel and wait for a warship," he told a Boston 
radio station. "I didn't think it was too good of an idea to wait for a 
warship. I was out there fishing. I was not at war." 
</P>
<P>
He said he headed back toward American waters while dodging the Canadian 
vessel's warning shots. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple times I had to change course and get away from him because I was 
afraid he was going to ram me again," Fuery said. "When he started shooting at 
us, he was trying to get as close as he could. At times he was firing shots 
from a quarter-mile away." 
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials told a different version. They said the fishing boat rammed 
the 366-foot destroyer three times, prompting the warning shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadians fired five to 10 rounds with a small, submachine-like gun about 
100 yards ahead of the vessel, and when that failed to produce any results, 
they fired a round from a 3-inch, .50-caliber gun in front of the Concordia, 
said Lt. Doug Maybee, a spokesman for the Canadian Navy.

President Bush was not signaling any new bailout for the savings-and-loan 
industry when he disclosed that more financing might be needed, a White House 
spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that the President "was not 
signaling any new money or any new legislation or new financing" in his remarks 
at a news conference with editorial page editors Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the savings-and-loan situation, Bush said: "I do know that we've 
got to clean it up, and it's a whale of a mess. And we'll see where we go, but 
we had this one refinancing. I am now told that that might not be enough." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that Bush had based his remark on conversations he had had, but 
has "no plans to take any action." 
</P>
<P>
The press spokesman declined to identify with whom Bush had talked about the 
thrift industry and where he received the pessimistic report.

France, a leading backer of European Monetary Union, said today it will lift 
its last foreign exchange controls at the start of 1990, eliminating 
restrictions on sending money abroad for the first time since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The action is linked to the European Community's movement toward a single 
European currency, which suggests as a first step the elimination of all 
domestic currency controls. 
</P>
<P>
"The French government has decided to completely free the movement of capital 
from Jan. 1, 1990, onward," Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said in a 
statement. "This expresses our confidence in the good health of the French 
economy and in the stability of our currency."

The economy will steer clear of a recession next year but will grow only 
moderately, the nation's purchasing managers predicted today. 
</P>
<P>
Although a recession isn't forecast, more corporate purchasing executives are 
worried about economic conditions than ever before in the 27 years the National 
Assn. of Purchasing Management has asked its members to say how they feel about 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
"The exceptionally high level of concern about the economy in 1990 is 
overshadowed by the overall forecast of growth, albeit moderate," said Robert 
J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate purchasers monitor conditions closely because they must make spending 
decisions based on assumptions about how business will be, how much inflation 
will erode buying power and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's semiannual forecast, released at a news conference, said 64% 
of the members expect business to be better rather than worse in 1990 than in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast said economic growth will average 5% next year, before adjusting 
for inflation, with the second half of the year improving from a weak first six 
months. Rising capital expenditures, expanding exports and slowing imports will 
contribute to the increase in economic output. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation will continue easing next year after turning out to be milder than 
previously expected in 1989, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
Purchasers said their prices increased an average of 2.6% in 1989, sharply 
lower than the 5% reported for 1988 and less than the 3.7% increase originally 
predicted for 1989.

<P>
Major steel-producing nations have agreed to abide by new restrictions on 
exports to the United States and to end subsidies on steel production, U.S. 
Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills said today. 
</P>
<P>
Hills said the program extends existing voluntary quotas for 2 1/2 years and 
commits the nations to end subsidies and to keep their home markets open to 
foreign steel. 
</P>
<P>
"The bilateral agreements restricting trade-distorting practices are the 
cornerstone of the President's program to seek a consensus to address the 
causes rather than the symptoms affecting world trade in steel," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The program, announced by President Bush on July 25, is designed to shield the 
U.S. steel industry from cheap foreign imports while it modernizes to meet 
overseas competition. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the program say that the American steel industry is profitable and 
that continued curbs on foreign steel would hurt the competitiveness of 
domestic steel users, who are handicapped in their own export drives by paying 
higher prices for steel. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign producers took about 30% of the U.S. steel market five years ago. Last 
year the figure was about 20%. 
</P>
<P>
The new quota program limits imports to 19.1% of the U.S. market in the first 
year and 20.1% in the second, including incentives to nations that end their 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Voluntary restraint agreements were reached with the 12 member nations of the 
European Community, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, 
Finland, Hungary, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, China, Poland, Romania, Trinidad 
and Tobago, Venezuela and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Agreements to end many subsidies immediately and others in phases were reached 
with the EC, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, and Trinidad and 
Tobago, countries that account for 90% of the imports covered by the so-called 
voluntary restraints. 
</P>
<P>
Hills also said that negotiations to end subsidies and keep domestic markets 
open were under way with several other countries, including Austria, Finland 
and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
The agreements mandate binding arbitration to settle complaints, she said. 
</P>
<P>
All the signers, Hills said, pledged to negotiate for rules to bar subsidies 
and further reduce tariffs under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
S. Linn Williams, deputy trade representative, said the Administration had no 
plans to extend the quotas again when they expire in 1992. He told reporters 
that by then a global steel agreement is expected to be in place. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said foreign nations would realize if they increased exports to the 
United States when the pact expired that pressure would swell for renewed 
quotas, particularly because 1992 is an election year. 
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. steel industry is free to file a complaint while the agreement 
is in effect but that any nation named in a complaint likely would drop out of 
the pact. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a kind of a mutually assured destruction between the industry and the 
exporting countries," Williams said.

Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. said today that it intends to resume program trading for 
its own account, returning to the market strategy using voluntary curbs 
proposed recently by the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Bear Stearns was one of the brokers most active in program trading before a 
stock market plunge Oct. 13 led most to curtail or stop the trading practice. 
</P>
<P>
Program trading, or index arbitrage in its most widely used form, is the 
computer-directed buying and selling of stock futures or options and stocks to

"Seven Samurai," will receive an honorary Oscar award at the presentations 
March 26, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The award will be presented to Kurosawa for his cinematic accomplishments that 
have inspired, delighted, enriched and entertained worldwide audiences and 
influenced filmmakers throughout the world," the academy, which presents the 
awards, said. 
</P>
<P>
Kurosawa, whose 1951 production of "Rashomon" won an Oscar for best foreign 
language film, is also a film producer and scriptwriter. 
</P>
<P>
His 1975 film "Dersu Uzala," submitted by the Soviet Union, also won an Oscar 
for best foreign language film, making him the only director to win that 
category for two countries. He was nominated as best director in 1985 for 
"Ran."

TARTIKOFF'S GAME PLAN FOR KEEPING NBC ON TOP; 
</P>
<P>
RATINGS: THE NO. 1 NETWORK IS FIDDLING WITH ITS POWERHOUSE THURSDAY NIGHT 
LINEUP, ADDING "GRAND," A NEW SITCOM.

Brandon Tartikoff, president of prime-time winner NBC Entertainment, held a 
closed-circuit press conference Monday. Among the announcements: 
</P>
<P>
"Mancuso FBI" and "Sister Kate" have been picked up for the full season. The 
network had previously picked up "Baywatch," "Hardball" and "Quantum Leap," 
none of which appears so far to be headed for a niche in the Prime-time 
Pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff also confirmed that his all-powerful Thursday night lineup is in for 
a change in mid-January, when a new sitcom called "Grand" replaces "Dear John" 
at 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear John" will move to the 9:30 Wednesday time slot, replacing "My Two Dads," 
which will repair to a new time slot, to be decided within the next couple of 
weeks. "Dear John," meanwhile, has been renewed for the 1990-91 season, 
Tartikoff reported. 
</P>
<P>
As described by NBC, "Grand" is "a semiserialized look at life in America this 
minute from three distinct socioeconomic viewpoints in the fictional town of 
Grand, Pa., a city struggling to regain its former glory." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff also predicted that negotiations with Bill Cosby for a seventh season 
of his high-rated series will conclude successfully very soon. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff also revealed that the still mysterious one-hour drama series 
starring Alan Alda -- the latter's first TV series project in six years -- 
starts production soon, that a pilot will be ready by May and that he's hoping 
a spot can be found for it on the fall 1990 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Besides "Grand," six other series are being considered as possible mid-season 
replacements: "Shannon's Deal," "Carol &amp; Co." (that's Carol Burnett, 
playing a different character each week), "The Seinfeld Chronicle" (about a 
stand-up comic), "Down Home," "Wings" and the radio station sitcom, "FM," which 
has already had a tryout.

A Tokyo art dealer paid $5.9 million today for an 8th-Century porcelain horse, 
a record price for Chinese art, Sotheby's auctioneers said. 
</P>
<P>
The price for the Tang Dynasty horse, stolen and chipped by thieves last month, 
was three times higher than Sotheby's estimate and twice the previous record 
for Chinese art, an auction house spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer was identified only as Mr. Shimojo of Shimojo's art dealers in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-inch glazed porcelain statue was stolen from a Hong Kong warehouse last 
month and recovered only 10 days ago when Hong Kong police raided an apartment 
and arrested three men. 
</P>
<P>
The horse, exhibited from 1985 to '88 at the Dallas Museum of Art, was returned 
with a tiny chip in its green-colored saddle, Sotheby's spokeswoman Polly 
Hitching said. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record for Chinese art was $2.76 million paid for a rare Guanyao 
brush washer, or small porcelain dish, at a Hong Kong auction in May.

'CITY OF ANGELS' TAKES A CHANCE

<P>
A spotlight searches the big city skyline as a high-powered jazz prelude fills 
the theater. Then gunshots and sirens. Finally, the tough-guy monotone of a 
private detective right out of Raymond Chandler is heard. 
</P>
<P>
It's the opening of "City of Angels," the hard-boiled, private eye musical that 
barreled into Broadway's Virginia Theater on Monday night. It's an ambitious 
and innovative show from creators Cy Coleman, Larry Gelbart and David Zippel. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say "City of Angels" is perfect. The evening runs on too long, 
and the main character needs more definition -- and a little more heart. 
</P>
<P>
The place is Los Angeles, the time the late 1940s. A disillusioned Hollywood 
screenwriter named Stine would rather write mystery novels about a fictional 
gumshoe named Stone than toil as a hack for an unscrupulous movie producer. But 
he needs the money. 
</P>
<P>
"City of Angels" brings Stine's fictional detective to life. The audience sees 
both Stine's real life and the world he is forced to create for the silver 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
Stine, played with nerdish charm by Gregg Edelman, has a soul mate in Stone. 
James Naughton gives the show's best performance as the rakish detective. 
"You're nothing without me," the two men sing together in one of the musical's 
more persistent melodies. 
</P>
<P>
Like its hero, "City of Angels" takes a chance. From Coleman's scintillating, 
thematically linked score to Gelbart's ingenious, multilayered story, the show 
doesn't play safe. And that's more than you can say for most of the musicals in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
In other reviews: 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times' Frank Rich wondered: "How long has it been since a musical 
was brought to a halt by riotous jokes?" He praised Gelbart for his "endlessly 
witty wordplay" and composer Coleman for "a delirious celebration of jazz and 
pop styles." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Post's Clive Barnes praised the cast as good and said the play had 
"taste, resonance and imagination." But, "the one thing it doesn't completely 
do is work. . . . What we have here are a bunch of ideas searching for 
fulfillment," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News' Howard Kissel said he "didn't have a good time" at the 
"contrived parody."

"Doogie Howser, M.D.," a TV series about a 16-year-old physician, is even more 
improbable than most shows, say officials at two of the country's top medical 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Doogie, played by Neil Patrick Harris, is just too far ahead of his time, 
said Helen Rakin, a Harvard Medical School admissions officer. 
</P>
<P>
"Doogie Howser would have had to graduate from college at 9, start medical 
school at 10, graduate from medical school at 14, then, after one year of 
internship and one year of residency, obtain his license to practice at 16," 
she said in this week's TV Guide. "I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Henry M. Seidel, associate dean of students at Johns Hopkins Medical 
School, said that if he were on the admissions committee, a real-life Doogie 
would never be accepted to medical school. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say to Doogie, 'Look, we need people with smarts. You've got that. Now 
all you need is the rest of it. . . . When you get to be 19 or 20, then come 
back and reapply, and chances are, you're going to get in. But Doogie, not now. 
Just get your first kiss.' "

YANKEES GET LEARY FROM REDS

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Yankees, desperate to improve their pitching staff, acquired 
former Dodger Tim Leary from the Cincinnati Reds today for two minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees, whose 4.50 earned-run average was the second-worst in baseball 
last season behind Detroit, sent outfielder Hal Morris and right-hander Rodney 
Imes to Cincinnati for Leary and minor-league outfielder Van Snider. 
</P>
<P>
"In getting Leary, we are adding an experienced, quality pitcher to the staff 
who can give us 200 innings," said George Bradley, Yankees' vice president of 
player development and scouting. "Snider is a good left-handed hitter who 
provides us with depth in the outfield." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees were determined to get starting pitching after failing in their bid 
for free agent Mark Langston. In Leary, they got a 31-year-old who will be 
playing for his fifth major-league club. 
</P>
<P>
Leary was 8-14 last season with a 3.52 ERA and is 45-56 lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
He was 17-11 with a 2.91 ERA with the Dodgers in 1988 but was just 6-7 last 
July 18 when Los Angeles traded him to Cincinnati with Mariano Duncan for Kal 
Daniels and Lenny Harris. Leary went 2-7 in 14 starts for the Reds with a 3.71 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
He was a star at UCLA when the New York Mets picked him in the first round of 
the June, 1979, draft. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets brought him up to the majors to start the 1981 season. But he strained 
a muscle in his right elbow at Wrigley Field in his major league debut and did 
not pitch again in the major leagues until 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Leary was 1-1 for the Mets in 1983 and 3-3 in 1984, then was dealt to 
Milwaukee. He was 1-4 for the Brewers in 1985 and 12-12 in 1986 before 
Milwaukee traded him to Los Angeles with pitcher Tim Crews for first baseman 
Greg Brock. 
</P>
<P>
He was 3-11 in 1987 and then had the best year of his career in 1988 as Los 
Angeles won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Snider was 1 for 7 last season with the Reds and batted .222 at 
Nashville of the Class AAA American Assn. He is 7 for 35 lifetime in the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Morris was 5 for 18 for the Yankees in 1989 after batting a 
league-leading .326 with Columbus of the International League. He is 7 for 38 
lifetime in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Imes, 23, was 17-6 with a 2.73 ERA for Albany of the Eastern League.

No date has been set for the National Hockey League to begin using television 
replays to decide disputed goals but the system will probably be adopted, a 
league spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no resolution yet," NHL spokesman Gary Meagher said in response to a 
report in the Toronto Star that the league would begin using replays for the 
Stanley Cup playoffs in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The league will experiment with replays during the preseason in 1990, the 
newspaper reported. Only the referee would be allowed to seek a television 
ruling, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Meagher said replays were discussed at an NHL general managers meeting in 
Chicago last month and will be on the agenda at the next meeting in January at 
Orlando, Fla.

New York Jets quarterback Ken O'Brien has aggravated his injured throwing 
shoulder and is questionable for Sunday's game against the Rams at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien was supposed to sit out Sunday's 13-0 loss to Pittsburgh, but he 
aggravated his shoulder injury when he was forced to play after Pat Ryan was 
knocked out of the game with a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien's arm was so sore it kept him up most of Sunday night. He won't throw 
until Friday, if at all, Coach Joe Walton said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who complained Monday of headaches and a stiff neck following a late hit 
from Pittsburgh's Greg Lloyd, is also questionable. 
</P>
<P>
That means Tony Eason, who signed with the Jets on Nov. 7 after being picked up 
on waivers from New England, could start. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, who has been working on a reduced throwing schedule all season because 
of rotator cuff tendinitis, jammed his shoulder against San Diego.

The U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame may have to close temporarily because of financial 
problems, according to its board Chairman John Heneman. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in deep financial trouble," Heneman said Monday. "We just don't have 
any money and it may be that it may have to be closed temporarily. We get lots 
of promises, but we haven't got any money." 
</P>
<P>
The board has considered private and public sources for operating money, 
Heneman said. Hall of Fame board members met last summer with Gov. Rudy Perpich 
and were encouraged, but so far no state money has been made available, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 72 U.S.-born hockey standouts have been named to the hall, which 
opened in 1973.

Most members of the Kansas City Royals said they were pleased with the team's 
signing of reliever Mark Davis, but the Royals' reliever who will lose his 
closer's role says he is upset and shocked. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what it does is put me on the best pitching staff in baseball and 
wanting to leave it," said Jeff Montgomery, who had 18 saves and a 1.37 ERA 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery, who replaced Steve Farr as the closer when Farr developed knee 
problems at mid-season, said that he would not demand to be traded but that 
having his job taken away has left him "totally unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to have the opportunity to pick up where I left off last season and 
see what I could do over the course of a year," Montgomery said in a telephone 
interview from Cincinnati. "I'm extremely shocked that this would happen to me 
after what I did last year." 
</P>
<P>
Farr, who also finished with 18 saves, said he was impressed with the signing 
of Davis. "I know we're going to be competitive for sure," he said, adding that 
he sees a personal downside to the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time they go get another reliever, it doesn't make my job any more 
secure," said Farr, adding that his knee is strong after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery and Farr were projected as set-up men for Davis, although pitching 
Coach Frank Funk said Montgomery might also be used as a closer in certain 
situations and could even be used as a starter.

Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner shoved aside Meryl Streep and Roseanne Barr 
in the box office, as Fox's black comedy "The War of the Roses" opened with 
$9.7 million, compared to $3.5 million for the debut of Orion's "She-Devil." 
Both films feature big-name celebrities in marital battles, but in per-screen 
averages, the final count was: Douglas-Turner $7,696, Streep-Barr $2,502. 
Warner Bros.' holiday spoof "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" finished a 
close second to "War of the Roses" with $9.5 million. Universal's "Back to the 
Future Part II" continued to plunge since its record-breaking Thanksgiving 
opening, falling 42% in the box office over its third weekend.
