"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai" (1984), directed by W.D. Richter. 103 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Rated PG-13. Forget Dick Tracy, Batman, Darkman, The Flash, et al. Buckaroo 
Banzai is the greatest comic-book hero who never was. He's also the hippest 
super-hero around. When not fronting his band of New Jersey rock 'n' rollers, 
he's busy creating a device to penetrate the eighth dimension. It might take 
two or three viewings just to figure out what the heck is going on, but the 
ride is worth it. RANDY LEWIS

"Smithereens" (1982), directed by Susan Seidelman. 90 minutes. No rating. In 
the spirit of the punk movement that inspired it, this film spews raw 
spontaneity, stars a mostly non-professional cast and looks like it was made 
for a few thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
It focuses on Wren, a hyper, just-out-of-high-school Jersey girl trying to be a 
part of the New York punk scene, and a band called Smithereens. DOUG LIST

A mall bar that offers sightseeing as a chaser. Perched a few feet above the 
slipperly main drag of Crystal Court, and tucked inside an Italian restaurant, 
this bar offers a Kodak view of bustling shoppers and a peaceful respite from 
the masses. It may be the next best thing to a Sharper Image store for killing 
time.

Tia Juana's Long Bar &amp; Mexican Cafe Deluxe, 14988 Sand Canyon Ave., Irvine. 
The bar is open 11 a.m to midnight Sunday through Thursday, till 1:30 a.m. 
Friday and Saturday. (714) 551-2998. Housed inside a restored 95-year-old lima 
bean warehouse, this is the kind of cavernous bar where you might actually have 
room to breathe. Order a cerveza (they claim to serve any Mexican beer you can 
name) or a hand-shaken margarita, and pretend you're inside some upscale, 
south-of-the-border restaurant that actually has napkins. JANET EASTMAN

Whatever you're toasting (or whomever you're chasing), this is a great 
after-work pit stop. Drinks are well-stirred and the happy hour buffet table is 
well-stocked with spicy finger foods. Plus, papier-mache parrots, chintzy

In the early 1920s it was a barbershop, serving root beer and sandwiches to 
waiting customers. When Prohibition ended, the health department said either 
serve food and beer or cut hair. The beer still comes in frosted 20-ounce 
schooners, the eggs are pickled on the premises, there's pool and snooker in 
the back room, and freshly roasted peanuts and cigars are sold behind the bar.

Open daily 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 240-2392. This is not a place for a quick

darts. The pub's in a bit of an unlikely spot, so watch for the red

A Hollywood Christmas Carol:

Several years ago, Michael Attie says that his "peaceful meditations in a 
Japanese Zen temple were interrupted by a shocking telegram." His father had 
died and Attie inherited the family business, a lingerie shop on Hollywood 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
As Attie tells it, "My real desire in life was to become a priest and run a 
temple. . . . I've tried to convert the store into a sort of 'lingerie temple.' 
I am a lingerie monk." 
</P>
<P>
Each holiday season, he becomes a lingerie Santa. On Friday at 2 p.m., he'll 
hand out 100 free Christmas trees in front of his store, Playmates of 
Hollywood, at Hollywood and Wilcox. It really tugs at your G-strings, er, heart

One last note about the old "pest farm" at Chavez Ravine, which we mentioned 
last week. The hospital for contagious-disease victims, which closed around

Pettit. 
</P>
<P>
Sports were not unknown to the area prior to the Dodgers' arrival. Pettit 
enclosed an article written for a historical society that spoke of 19th-Century 
Angelenos attending bullfights and cockfights there "as well as bull- and 
bear-baitings for entertainment."

I read your editorial in opposition to the import ban of RU-486 ("The Effect Is

area.

<P>
In mid-November, I testified before Rep. Ron Wyden's (D-Ore.) subcommittee 
investigating this matter. I represented the National Cushing's Assn. (NCA). 
Cushing's Syndrome is a rare, endocrine disorder, affecting primarily women, in 
which the body produces massive amounts of cortisol resulting in disfiguring 
systemic difficulties. Limited studies at National Institutes of Health with 
RU-486 have shown great promise in treating this disease. The problem is the 
import alert. This alert allows the Food and Drug Administration to limit 
access to the drug, and it also allows the French manufacturer to play games 
with its distribution choices -- even for legitimate research. We don't know 
how many Cushing's patients could be helped by this drug, and the import alert 
guarantees that it will stay that way. NIH studies have been halted because of 
uncertainty about availability of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
We believe that the agenda of politics should never affect the progress of 
science, and we plan to carry that message forward.

The Moscow railroad yard, the Soviet paper Pravda reported the other day, has 
become a graveyard for food and other urgently needed goods. As of Sunday, 
20,000 containers and 300 freight cars packed with 23,500 tons of everything 
from bananas and meat to medicine and wine awaited unloading. This is in a city 
where for months store shelves have been bare of virtually anything that humans 
would consider edible. 
</P>
<P>
In Leningrad and other port cities, ships loaded with flour, meat, sugar and 
other food from abroad ride low in the water, waiting to be emptied of their 
cargoes. With winter only a week away, Soviet consumers face the steadily 
worsening effects of a distribution system that seems to be all but terminally 
gridlocked. In these circumstances, does it make sense for Washington to 
provide the Soviet Union with credits so that it can buy American food? It 
does, for immediate humanitarian reasons and for longer-term political ones. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is waiving, for the time being, the restrictions of 
Jackson-Vanik, the 1974 law that denies the Soviet Union trade benefits in the 
absence of a more liberal emigration policy. Soviet lawmakers have yet to 
codify such a policy, but in practice increasing numbers of Soviet citizens, 
especially Jews and Armenians threatened with discrimination and persecution, 
are able to leave the country. That change warrants the opportunity for relief 
that suspension of Jackson-Vanik makes possible. 
</P>
<P>
But the United States and other donor nations can't solve the distribution 
crisis that, especially in the big cities of the Russian Republic, has kept 
food and other goods out of the hands of increasingly desperate consumers. The 
reasons for that crisis are varied, ranging from crime and corruption -- up to 
50% of all consumer goods, food included, is now thought to be diverted to the 
black market -- to deliberate sabotage by die-hard Communists eager to 
discredit President Mikhail Gorbachev and his reforms. Hoarding, not least by 
officials, is widespread. Trucks, drivers and storage space to shift goods from 
ports and rail yards are said to be wholly inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
It's a mess, and ordinary citizens more and more blame Gorbachev for it, to the 
delight of his enemies on both the far left and far right. Gorbachev's own 
political survival is not, of course, necessarily a vital U.S. interest. But 
the survival and success of reforms that seek a freer, more productive, humane 
and moderate Soviet system unmistakably are. It's up to Soviet officials to 
clean up the corruption and inefficiencies that dog their distribution system. 
It's up to the United States and other countries that have a stake in the 
Soviet Union's future to help now, to the greatest extent possible, with 
humanitarian aid.

Your editorial says doctors have a "responsibility" under the Hippocratic oath 
to give people RU-486 "as a safe alternative to surgical abortions." 
</P>
<P>
This would be news to Hippocrates. His oath, the basis for civilized medicine, 
states, "I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will 
I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly, I will not give a woman an 
abortive remedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art."

Yes, this is a volunteer army. If I hear this from one other television

I am so revolted by the constant rationalization of those who say that these 
men who joined the volunteer army were motivated only by a need to protect our 
country, no matter what the reason for the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
We all know, or should know, that many of them, if not most of them, hoped to 
become educated, or even to support their families by joining the military. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if Neil Bush or Dan Quayle were in the front lines in the first attack 
if our President would be in such a hurry to commit to war. How about a yuppie

discussion of why?

I was shocked and hurt by the letters (Dec. 2) about my niece Sasha Graves and 
our friends, the Gun Owners REACT Committee. 
</P>
<P>
They said Sasha was crying when Michael McNulty tried to help her pop some 
balloons with a pellet gun. 
</P>
<P>
Sasha didn't cry any time during her visit at the gun range. 
</P>
<P>
Sasha's reaction in the picture with your article was shyness when all those 
reporters crowded around her, and she couldn't see through the sight so she 
scrunched up her eyes and rubbed them after trying. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't you use the picture you took of Sasha waving at all the folks when 
they introduced her to the crowd? She was really smiling when they cheered for 
her, and with the help from the gun owners she is smiling now.

A GRASS-ROOTS WAR RESISTANCE IS BLOSSOMING; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY BUILDUP HITS A NERVE WHERE THOSE MOST AFFECTED LIVE.

The national media keep looking in the wrong places for the anti-war movement. 
They wander around quiet Ivy League campuses, talk to five leftish white men 
who own opinion journals and conclude that anti-war sentiment is soft. The 
hidden, underreported story is that there is an anti-war movement: A 
decentralized, grass-roots, spontaneous and improvised effort is being waged by 
tens of thousands of ordinary Americans seeking to make their voices heard in 
opposition to U.S. involvement in a war in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the early action and leadership came from places like the University of 
Montana, Juniata College in Pennsylvania and Manchester in Indiana, James 
Madison University in Virginia -- less-prestigious institutions whose students 
identify with those young men and women who went into military service as a 
means of upward mobility. When President Bush doubled the troop deployment in 
the Persian Gulf, student response escalated. Within weeks, students organized 
hunger strikes, teach-ins, marches and vigils all across the country. At my own 
campus, the University of California, Davis, no hotbed of student radicalism, 
there have been two teach-ins and continuing forums about the gulf crisis. All 
this, and without a draft. 
</P>
<P>
Spontaneous activity also is erupting off-campus. Without benefit of 
centralized leadership, people are improvising protests reminiscent of the 
imaginative, peaceful actions waged by East European students and dissidents 
last winter. Communities across the country have held town meetings. In Salt 
Lake City, right-wing anti-war sentiment crowds the radio talk shows. Alex 
Molnar, the Wisconsin father whose op-ed piece in the New York Times touched a 
national nerve, has created an organization for parents similarly anguished 
about the prospects of war. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Francisco Bay Area, to cite but one regional example, Oakland 
mothers of draft-age children meet weekly at a commuter train station. They 
carry signs urging "Honk if you want negotiation, not war." The noise that 
greets them tells them they are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty East Bay women spontaneously created a group called Working Women 
Against the War. They call into radio talk shows and tape special public 
announcements for television broadcast. They also developed a phone chain in 
which each woman called her senator, representative and the White House, and 
then called five friends around the country who did the same: Those five 
friends called five more friends. A White House operator told me that in just 
one week she was deluged by calls from this national effort. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-war movement is strong on individual action. One outraged woman in San 
Francisco wrote a petition against the war buildup and set herself up at a 
prominent intersection. Within hours, she had gathered hundreds of names. Two 
young black women called to active duty in the reserves decided to refuse, 
arguing that minorities pay a disproportionately higher cost in war. Within 
days they were offered assistance by a legion of lawyers, therapists, 
public-speaking experts, clergy and feminists. 
</P>
<P>
The urgency of imminent war is partly responsible for the rapid upsurge of 
spontaneous anti-war activity. This time, the protest is also fueled by the 
availability of truth, which the American people were denied during the Vietnam 
era. Two former chiefs of staff and four former secretaries of defense have 
publicly testified before Congress, counseling caution and patience in the gulf 
crisis, rather than a military solution. Only one day after the President 
raised the nuclear issue to scare Americans into supporting an offensive war, 
experts who had seen the same classified data about Iraq's nuclear capability 
rushed to declare that he was "misleading the country." Only one day after the 
U.N. Security Council voted to permit force against Iraq, Americans could read 
about the bribes, promises and threats used to secure this putative 
international consensus. Only one day after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
expounded on the need for force, CIA Director William H. Webster predicted that 
economic sanctions would weaken Iraq within the year. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is relinquishing its duty to debate a military solution or declare 
war; an imperial President is mortgaging the nation's future and playing 
high-stakes poker with Saddam Hussein. But Americans are justly famous for 
their entrepreneurial imagination and industry; with astonishing speed and 
ingenuity, they are giving their elected officials a glimpse of the grass-roots 
resistance that will greet a shooting war in the Persian Gulf.

WELFARE: OUR WILLINGNESS TO BELIEVE THE WORST ABOUT PEOPLE IS A NEW IMPEDIMENT 
TO CHARITY.

Western Reserve University.

Government assaults on the living standards of low-income people have been so 
common in the past nine years that they hardly rate a bulletin. Now, the threat 
of recession raises anxiety that trouble will reach people who may have thought 
themselves immune. So far unnoted and now even more important is the peculiarly 
mean and petty quality that has crept into our way of thinking about 
financially needy people. 
</P>
<P>
Among early evidences was a change in the federal welfare program, Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children. It seemed sensible to include childless but 
pregnant women in AFDC; perhaps they could avoid having low-birth-weight 
babies. In 1981, however, AFDC was amended to forbid payments to such women in 
the first six months of pregnancy. Someone had reflected that women might 
deliberately get pregnant in order to collect welfare for three or four months 
and then abort. Estimates were that $1 million -- in a $10-billion program -- 
would be saved by delaying AFDC coverage until the seventh month. In the whole 
country, how many women were thus discouraged from conceiving and planning a 
late abortion in order to cheat the government? What can have occupied the 
reveries of the legislator who worked out this problem and introduced it into 
the discussions of a committee dealing with weighty tax issues? 
</P>
<P>
More flagrant, because it displays the thought processes of a group of 
prestigious civic leaders and scholars, was the following observation about 
incentives for self-improvement as a factor in the lives of poor people; it 
occurred during a discussion about how to extend prenatal care: 
</P>
<P>
"The wonders of modern technology," a Ford Foundation report says, "may lead to 
a social policy dilemma: We are increasingly able to save the lives of even the 
tiniest newborns. We want people in all situations, including but not limited 
to the poor, to be able to avail themselves of life-saving technologies, but we 
do not want these technologies to encourage social behavior that triggers their 
use." 
</P>
<P>
It may require rereading to be certain that one has understood the logic: 
Pregnant women may eat poorly and fail to see a physician, not to mention use 
drugs and do other things that will injure their unborn children, because they 
think that modern technology will be able to undo the damage. In short, 
technology provides an incentive for neglecting one's unborn child! Do the 
authors seem intoxicated with their own words? Are they out of touch with 
ordinary women? Or is the problem more ominous: Are poor women in particular 
seen as an alien species requiring scientific management -- say, husbandry? 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the Emergency Food and Shelter National Board, involving people from 
United Way, the American Red Cross and other major philanthropies. They are 
promoting a program (pioneered in Los Angeles) that gives panhandlers food 
coupons instead of cash. We are to buy coupons redeemable for food and, when 
the spirit moves us, hand them out to beggars on the street. This says 
implicitly that we suspect that cash might be used for alcohol or drugs (as we 
do suspect, of course), and we have gone to some pains -- sent a check 
somewhere, or queued up at a counter -- to make sure the $1 or $2 we give is 
not misused. 
</P>
<P>
What is involved in such tender care about trivial sums of money? For the 
donor, does it not perfectly blend the pleasures of charity and righteousness? 
And is the recipient warmed by the gift? 
</P>
<P>
The United States has a long tradition of what historians call "scientific 
charity." For 100 years, the term has described and justified painstakingly 
measured help embedded in less-measured moral uplift. It is our privilege to be 
penurious, but what does it do for us or for the needy to think and act so mean 
while we are at it?

LAKERS FALTER IN THE FACE OF NEAR-RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: MAVERICKS ONE POINT FROM NBA MARK IN OUTSCORING L.A., 23-8, IN 
OVERTIME EN ROUTE TO WINNING, 112-97.

<P>
A funny thing happened on the way back to Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
After winning 10 of 12, the Lakers must have thought that Wednesday night's 
lesson was how to come from behind because they slept late into their game with 
what little remains of the Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers didn't like what they found upon awakening, either. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how it went: 
</P>
<P>
With three seconds left, Terry Teagle hit a five-foot jump shot to put the 
Lakers ahead, 89-87. 
</P>
<P>
With no time left in regulation, Dallas' Rodney McCray drilled a 19-footer, 
tying the game. 
</P>
<P>
The staggered Lakers then turned the ball over on their first three possessions 
in overtime, were outscored, 23-8 in the extra period and lost, 112-97, before 
16,086 in the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas total in overtime missed the NBA record by one point. 
</P>
<P>
Just for perspective, the Mavericks had lost 10 of 12 without injured star Roy 
Tarpley. Of their two previous victories without Tarpley, another was over the 
Lakers, who blew a 14-point lead in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't give them the respect they deserve," Laker Coach Mike Dunleavy 
said. "We didn't come out with the right frame of mind. We let them get the 
jump on us. We expended so much energy catching up. 
</P>
<P>
"Emotionally that (McCray's basket) was a shot to the stomach, and we didn't 
respond. But that game never should have gotten that far." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers trailed, 46-43, at the half, then saw the Mavericks start the third 
quarter with a 7-0 run. Now the Lakers had a real deficit to play with. 
</P>
<P>
They chased Dallas through the rest of the third and fourth quarters. With 1:06 
left, Magic Johnson got the Lakers their first tie in the half with a 
left-handed layup. 
</P>
<P>
With 16 seconds left, Johnson batted the ball away from Dallas' Rolando 
Blackman. 
</P>
<P>
With three seconds left, Teagle, shooting two for 12 at that point, scored on a 
short jump shot after driving into the lane. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches started jockeying. After three consecutive timeouts, Dallas 
inbounded the ball and Johnson took a foul that the Lakers had to give. Now 
Dallas had only 2.1 seconds to work with. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the ball went to McCray. A.C. Green had a hand in his face, but 
McCray's shot from the top of the circle dropped cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
Followed shortly thereafter by the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was probably the third, fourth or fifth guy they would expect to get the 
ball," McCray said. "But I ended up with a good shot. I had a lot of time to 
get it off." 
</P>
<P>
For the Mavericks, this season has been another game, another injury and, until 
Wednesday, another loss. 
</P>
<P>
Or as Blackman put it: "The pillars of the house are coming down and I'm just 
trying not to get hit by any bricks." 
</P>
<P>
Another brick teetered before the Wednesday's game when they learned that Herb 
Williams' bursitis in one heel might sideline him, too. Williams, however, 
played. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Mavericks raised their level, or the Lakers lowered theirs, the two 
levels met in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Alex English needed 22 points to become the eighth NBA player to score 25,000. 
At his average (7.5), that would have been four games' worth. He finished with 
18.

CLIPPERS RIPEN OVERNIGHT;

<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: A NIGHT AFTER BLOWING A GAME TO MINNESOTA, THEY BEAT CLEVELAND, 
100-90.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both came devoid of warning, without so much as a hint that Wednesday night's 
game at Richfield Coliseum would be changing. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith, who had stayed up until 3:30 a.m. nursing his badly bruised left 
thigh and woke up five hours later for more of the same, did not even know if 
he could play, and Coach Mike Schuler went a step further and counted his 
forward out. But when tip-off came, Smith was in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, who awoke Wednesday morning still stinging from the loss at 
Minnesota the night before, stumbled into a nine-point hole in the first 
quarter. But they used a 21-2 run to open the third quarter to beat the 
Cleveland Cavaliers, 100-90, and break an 11-game losing streak here. 
</P>
<P>
"They grew in about 24 hours," Schuler said. 
</P>
<P>
All the way to 10-10 and feeling about 10 feet tall in the process, courtesy of 
the best 6 1/2 minutes of Clipper basketball this season. They turned a 53-48 
halftime deficit into a 69-55 cushion that proved insurmountable, although the 
Cavaliers closed within 91-87 with 3:47 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
There was a 19-0 charge within the 21-2, the teams having traded baskets to 
open the third quarter before the Clipper pyrotechnics. Then. . . . 
</P>
<P>
They held Cleveland to one-of-11 shooting, with five trips that didn't even 
result in a shot. They scored on 10 of 14 possessions. They held the Cavaliers 
without a point -- from Brad Daughtery's rebound tip-in with 10:53 remaining in 
the quarter to Derrick Chievous' jump shot with 5:09 to play. 
</P>
<P>
The statement came without a statement. Schuler, as emotional as they come in 
the NBA, didn't haul out the fire-and-brimstone act at halftime, a minor upset 
in itself. The vocal cords got off easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could take the credit for that," he said. "But I didn't do anything 
to get them going. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought we were really aggressive to start the quarter. We hit two or 
three quick shots and just sort of picked ourselves up. . . . We got a nice 
roll going and made some easy shots." 
</P>
<P>
All while the Cavaliers struggled. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought our level of play wasn't very good," Cleveland Coach Lenny Wilkens 
said. "We didn't move the ball, we didn't play good defense, we didn't shoot 
the ball well. We seemed to be hesitating. Really hesitating at times, and when 
that happens we get out of sync." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, clearly hobbled, never got into a particularly good flow, but 
considering that Schuler had been planning to go without his second-leading 
scorer, anything was a bonus. That it was 40 minutes and 16 points before 
fouling out with 2:09 left turned out to be more than anyone expected. 
</P>
<P>
"Right up to before the game, I didn't know if I would play," he said. "I told 
Keith (Jones, the trainer) I couldn't squat or get low for my defensive 
positioning. I wasn't sure how much I could contribute, but I just said a 
prayer and went." 
</P>
<P>
The effect, however, could be costly. Smith already has declared himself out of 
Friday's game at Chicago, though there's time to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Always time for turnarounds when you're a Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Danny Ferry, the Cavalier rookie who came to Cleveland in the deal that sent 
Ron Harper and draft choices to the Clippers, went two for six from the field 
with one rebound in 16 minutes as a substitute. Whether the Clippers were 
motivated to face Ferry, who signed to play in Italy last season before even 
discussing a contract with the Clippers, depends on who you talk to. Most said 
there was no special motivation, but Ken Norman had the opposite approach. "If 
I said it wasn't, I'd be lying," he said. "He seemed like a pretty nice guy, 
but that was a real low blow to our organization, not even trying to negotiate 
before leaving. I just don't have any respect for him in that way." The 
Clippers contend that they spoke with Ferry on numerous occasions before making 
him the second pick in the 1989 draft and dispute comments to the contrary by 
Ferry in Sunday's Times. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Kimble has turned trigger shy again, just after he pronounced new-found 
aggressiveness with a 27-point game Dec. 2 against Minnesota at the Sports 
Arena. In the four outings since, he's gone three for nine, one for five, one 
for four and three for six. "He is very tentative," Coach Mike Schuler said. "I 
don't know why, either. All the rookies are struggling, but he hasn't been as 
aggressive as he would like, or we would like." . . . Norman had 30 points and 
11 rebounds, giving him an average of 28.3 in three starts since returning from 
an ankle injury.

LONG BEACH HOLDS OFF NORTHRIDGE; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: AFTER DRESSING DOWN BY GREENBERG, 49ERS RESPOND WITH 88-73 
VICTORY.

Seth Greenberg ripped off his coat and threw it into the first row. Then he 
looked into the eyes of his Cal State Long Beach players, who had nearly blown 
a 15-point lead, and screamed: "Where's your damn character? You have no 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
This happened during a timeout with 13:40 left in Wednesday night's game 
against Cal State Northridge, Long Beach holding a 56-53 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers reacted to their coach's outburst by outscoring Northridge, 20-4, in 
the next seven minutes and going on to an 88-73 victory before 1,711 in the 
university gym. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved the 49ers' record to 2-4. Northridge, which had been 
giving up 106 points a game, fell to 1-6. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg berated his players after the 49ers, who had built a 50-35 lead, 
stopped fighting for rebounds and loose balls. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot accept players playing lethargically, that's just not my 
personality," Greenberg said after the game. "This team can't afford to be 
lethargic against anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Lucious Harris, who had a game-high 25 points, explained why Long Beach 
finally began playing with enthusiasm: "We just didn't want to see (Greenberg) 
do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg did not apologize for actions. "If it takes that, for me to make an 
ass of myself, I'll do it, but this team is going to reflect my personality," 
he said. "My wife is probably embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
For a change, one consistent thing about the 49ers was their shooting. They 
shot 50% from the field in the first half and 51% in the second. They had been 
shooting 37%. 
</P>
<P>
Harris also had seven steals, six rebounds and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
Frankie Edwards added 15 points for Long Beach and Bryon Russell 14. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers made five turnovers in the first five minutes. With about nine 
minutes left in the half, they were ahead by only 19-18. 
</P>
<P>
Leading 25-22, they went on a 15-0 run with steals off the full-court press, 
crisp passing and aggressive rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Williams scored two consecutive baskets during the run on passes from 
Bobby Sears and Russell. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge went five minutes without a basket until Shelton Boykin, who led the 
Matadors with 16 points, scored at 2:22. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach led at the half, 46-33. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge shot 40% and made 23 turnovers, many of them forced by the press. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said that his personality had best been reflected by Williams, a 6-8 
reserve forward, though he had only five points, two rebounds and four 
turnovers in 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
What he had done, the coach said, was play with heart.

<P>
Cal State Long Beach can forget about catching Syracuse napping Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 3 Orangemen had their letdown Wednesday night, and they had to have a 
34-point performance from Billy Owens to pull out a 92-83 victory over Canisius 
at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a game like that to get you ready for the next game," Owens said. "We 
weren't ready to play. We'll be ready the next time. Look out!" 
</P>
<P>
Canisius (4-2) trailed 81-65 with 4:02 remaining but used a ball-hawking 
defense to fight back to 87-81 on senior guard Chuck Giscombe's three-point 
play with 1:07 to go. 
</P>
<P>
No. 5 Georgetown 75, St. Leo 45 -- Dikembe Mutombo scored 18 of his 22 points 
in the first half to lead the Hoyas to an easy victory at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Mutombo had eight rebounds and three blocked shots in the first half, helping 
the sluggish but unbeaten Hoyas open a 20-point halftime lead on their way to 
their sixth win of the season. Only two of those games have been against 
Division I teams. 
</P>
<P>
No. 8 Ohio State 90, Wright State 60 -- Mark Baker scored 10 of his 12 points 
during a 28-2 run early in the second half to lead the Buckeyes at Columbus, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Jackson led Ohio State (5-0) with 20 points, Treg Lee added a career-high 
15 and Perry Carter and Jamaal Brown each had 11. Baker had seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
No. 16 Connecticut 85, New Hampshire 32 -- Connecticut scored the first 32 
points of the game and breezed to the victory at Storrs, Conn. John Gwynn 
scored 21 points to lead the Huskies (5-1), who used a stifling press and

NBA ROUNDUP;

<P>
PAYBACK TIME FOR BIRD IN BEATING MILWAUKEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hot Rod Hundley, the one-time Lakers' court jester and a long time play-by-play 
announcer in the NBA, calls Larry Bird the greatest player of all time. 
</P>
<P>
That's high praise from Hundley, who roomed with Elgin Baylor and preceded 
Jerry West at West Virginia before they became teammates in Los Angeles. 
Hundley said Bird's intelligence and understanding of the game puts him above 
all others. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the 6-foot-9 Boston Celtics' star can adjust for the 
benefit of his team. After nine seasons as the "small" or shooting forward, 
Bird, 34, shifted to power forward this season. 
</P>
<P>
The move, made possible by the return of guard Brian Shaw from Italy and the 
play of rookie guard Dee Brown, has proved an instant success. The Celtics are 
one of the big surprises of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Bird, snapping out of a shooting slump, scored 18 of his 30 points in the first 
quarter Wednesday night at Boston to lead the Celtics to a 129-111 rout of 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks, who had won four in a row to take first place in the Central 
Division, made it a game for only the first eight minutes. Tied 20-20, the 
Celtics, with Bird showing the way, spurted to a 34-24 lead and were never 
headed. Bird made his first six shots. 
</P>
<P>
On a three-game trip last week to Texas, Bird was only 12 for 48 until he made 
three long baskets to end Sunday's game in Houston. Bird picked up where he 
left off in Texas, making 11 of 15 shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics have won 13 of their last 15 and their 17-4 record leads the 
Atlantic Division by three games. It is the second-best record in the league 
and five games better than at this time a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the challenge of playing a new role," Bird said. "There are new 
matchups and new defensive assignments. Unfortunately, when you aren't 
shooting, it doesn't make any difference what position you play." 
</P>
<P>
There was something else on Bird's mind for this one. In their previous meeting 
Nov. 13 at Milwaukee, Bird had played one of the worst games of his career. He 
had only five points in 28 minutes and the Bucks won big. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it would happen," moaned Buck Coach Del Harris. "He never forgets after 
a poor game." 
</P>
<P>
Houston 108, Philadelphia 100 -- When the Rockets last won in the Philadelphia 
Spectrum, Akeem Olajuwon was only 10. 
</P>
<P>
He had 29 points and 15 rebounds and, almost by himself, ended the Rockets' 
23-game losing streak at Philadelphia. Houston last won there Jan. 2, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets led by 11 points in the first quarter and increased it to 21 in the 
second quarter before Charles Barkley rallied the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley had 29 points, but he and the other 76ers' big man, Rick Mahorn, 
couldn't match the rebounding of Olajuwon and Otis Thorpe. The Rockets' big men 
had a 25-12 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 92, Charlotte 81 -- There was no letdown for David Robinson and his 
Spurs after a decisive victory over the NBA champion Pistons Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson had 24 points and 17 rebounds at Charlotte, and the Spurs pulled away 
steadily in the second half. The victory enabled the Spurs to take over first 
place in the Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
Although they made only 44% of their shots, the Spurs trailed only once. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 118, Miami 93 -- Dominique Wilkins had 28 points and 14 rebounds at 
Miami to lead the Hawks to their fourth victory in the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins had two three-point baskets in a 10-2 run in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 99, Indiana 90 -- The Pacers, the only team that hasn't won on the 
road, made it a close game before losing their 11th in a row away from home. 
</P>
<P>
But the Pacers' turnovers contributed to 13 of the SuperSonics' points in the 
fourth quarter. Dale Ellis played his first game of the season and had eight 
points for Seattle. DAN HAFNER

THIS TIME, BRUINS' WIN IS BLOODLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There was plenty of bad blood between the Hartford Whalers and Boston Bruins 
when they split back-to-back games in late November. 
</P>
<P>
After what the Whalers complained were cheap and vicious shots, the Bruins' Cam 
Neely was suspended five games for hitting defenseman Randy Ladoucer over the 
head with his stick. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the Whalers' harping on the numerous incidents only served to anger 
the Bruins. They were ready to play hockey Wednesday night at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Neely, refreshed by his enforced vacation, scored twice, and the Bruins 
dominated, 5-1, in a cleanly played game. 
</P>
<P>
There were only four minor penalties, and the only fight was after the game 
between Bob Sweeney of the Bruins and Mike Tomlak of the Whalers. Sweeney 
scored Boston's final goal in the second period on a penalty shot. 
</P>
<P>
Neely, getting a quick measure of revenge, opened the scoring 25 seconds after 
the opening faceoff. Ladoucer blocked Neely's first shot, but Craig Janney 
retrieved the puck and passed to Neely for the score. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Moog stopped 23 shots, but lost his shutout in the second period when Ed 
Kastelic scored. 
</P>
<P>
With the Montreal Canadiens losing, the Bruins raised their lead in the Adams 
Division to three points. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Montreal 1 -- Vince Damphousse broke a second-period tie with a 
power-play goal, and the Maple Leafs won a home game for the first time in a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The way the fans were chanting "Go, Habs, Go," it appeared that many in the 
sellout of 16,382 were rooting for the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Keane opened the scoring for the Canadiens, seeking their fourth victory 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
But the Maple Leafs dominated the rest of the game for their eighth victory in 
33 games. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 5, Vancouver 4 -- The Oilers are slowly developing a contender. With 
Joe Murphy scoring a goal and assisting on three others, the Oilers built a big 
lead at Edmonton and barely lasted. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved the Oilers, who had been deep in the cellar after their slow 
start, into fifth place in the Smythe Division. DAN HAFNER

nuttiness. Keep up the good work.

DOING TIME IN AN AMERICAN GULAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Spending 97 Months in a Family of Felons" (Nov. 10): I represented 
Jacqueline Hendricks, who pleaded guilty in federal court in Seattle to 
conspiracy to distribute cocaine. She was arrested by Drug Enforcement 
Administration agents at Sea-Tac Airport with two kilos of cocaine in her 
overnight bag and sentenced to 97 months. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, although she was merely a courier, she faced the same 
penalties as the leaders of the conspiracy if she was convicted at trial. There 
was a potential sentence of 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks' case is not atypical of many first-time drug offenders who are 
caught in the federal system. Like Hendricks, a number of them are highly 
intelligent, well educated and have no prior criminal record. Many receive 
prison sentences of 10, 15, 20 years or more due to mandatory sentencing laws. 
They could and would be rehabilitated if it were not for the Draconian 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
We are slowly but surely creating an American Gulag. It does not appear likely 
that the manufacturers of cocaine and heroin are ever going to be stopped and 
there is an infinite supply of middlemen and couriers. 
</P>
<P>
Years from now the public may come to realize that we have imposed cruelly 
excessive penalties for no particular reason.

CLASSIC CASE: ADLER'S LISTS OF GREAT BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest and dismay the interview with Mortimer J. Adler on the 
"Great Books" list revision ("A Curmudgeon Stands His Ground," Dec. 3). 
</P>
<P>
The crux of the matter, it seems to me, is not the inclusion of books in lists, 
but the inclusion of culture, thought, and quality of character in people. 
</P>
<P>
Adler is represented in your interview as an insufferable, arrogant, bigoted 
pedant. If people become like him after a lifetime of reading the classics, I 
say let us do away with the classics. 
</P>
<P>
Great books are not an academic football with which to score points against 
other book listers with different priorities. They are not a popularity contest 
for competing cultures. They are literature. They are to be read. 
</P>
<P>
There is no need whatsoever for what Adler does or the book series he edits. 
Every book on his list is widely available in libraries, paperbacks, 
anthologies, and friends' bookshelves. 
</P>
<P>
There are thousands of lists of recommended books put out every year. Anyone 
who wants to read these books can do so easily. What is needed is more reading 
of books, not just owning of them. 
</P>
<P>
Adler sounds as though he thinks he gives a book its greatness. Alas for him, 
the books were already great before he was born. How sad that he missed the 
opportunity they offered to make him great as well.

NO ADMIRATION FOR THE GRAND LIFESTYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How nice for Norman and Claire Weiss to have options the rest of us can only 
dream about ("Turning Away From Grand Lifestyle," Dec. 2). 
</P>
<P>
Without begrudging these people anything, I resent The Times' presentation of 
their decision to live a simpler life in Utah on $500,000 a year as indicative 
of some sort of national trend. 
</P>
<P>
This is simply another of those articles, so ubiquitous over the past decade, 
that enjoin the common folk to admire and envy the wealthy as we toil to meet 
basic needs. 
</P>
<P>
When will your editors realize that we down here at the bottom of the 
trickle-down are weary of being asked to fawn over the amassment of wealth by 
the few on top?

INTO THE NIGHT: ENJOYING A 'LONG WALK HOME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: The premiere of New Visions Pictures' and Miramax Films' "The Long 
Walk Home" at Century City's Cineplex Odeon, followed by a party at the nearby 
Twenty/20 club. Approximately $15,000 was raised Tuesday for the United Negro 
College Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: The special guest was 77-year-old Rosa Parks, the "Mother of the 
Modern Civil Rights Movement," who, by refusing to give up her seat to a white 
man, triggered the 1955 Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott that is the film's 
setting. Also there were the film's stars, Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek; 
director, Richard Pearce; producers, Howard Koch Jr. and Dave Bell, and Miramax 
co-chairman Harvey Weinstein, plus 700 guests, including Patrick Swayze and 
wife Lisa Niemi, Laura Dern, Lou Gossett Jr., Anthony Quinn, Suzanne de Passe, 
Magic Johnson and Marla Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: That Rosa Parks came out for the opening. "They invited me and I felt 
something about Montgomery would be worthwhile to see," said Parks. "It's a 
great movie. It opens up what we have endured and what went on." 
</P>
<P>
Tribute: The guest of honor walked right by the cameras at one point and shyly 
avoided the limelight. "I mean, they couldn't get her off a bus," said one 
publicist. "She's going to do what she wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "It's sobering that we still have so far to go," said Spacek, who plays 
a well-off white woman who becomes a supporter of the movement through her 
black maid. "We're still pained by things we felt 35 years ago. Dr. King's 
dream has still not been realized." 
</P>
<P>
Also Quoted: "Thing have changed somewhat," said Goldberg. "I'm here, I came in 
the front door, I arrived in a limousine. So things have changed a bit. It's 
not where it should be, but it's not where it was. So it's getting better, but 
it's slow." 
</P>
<P>
Whoopi's Career Plans: "I don't care if it's comedy or drama, I'm just glad to 
be working," said Goldberg. "I'll go anywhere someone offers me a check that 
won't bounce." 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Guests thought the film will inevitably be compared to "Driving Miss 
Daisy," although this story is told much more from a black perspective. Of the 
experience of filming in Alabama, producer Bell said: "The people in Montgomery 
were very cooperative. Some were suspicious, but if you've ever dealt with a 
movie company, you have reason to be suspicious."

GENTLEMAN REBEL THE MEMOIRS OF H. STUART HUGHES. TICKNOR &amp; FIELDS, $24.95,

<P>
When he was an adolescent, H. Stuart Hughes tells us, he spent time 
depressively trying to figure out his social status. He lived in the upper 
middle-class neighborhood of Riverdale, on the northern end of the Bronx; but 
certainly, his family was not middle class. 
</P>
<P>
The Hugheses were prosperous, yet nowhere in the range of the great American 
families and fortunes. Grandfather, on the other hand -- Charles Evans Hughes 
-- was secretary of state and then chief justice of the United States, and 
perhaps the most respected Republican of his time. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, that baked Henry Stuart into the upper crust. Perhaps, the bottom of 
the upper crust, he muses. But then there were the Kennedys; much richer, and 
beginning to be more powerful. When Joseph P. Kennedy moved from Riverdale to 
greater things, the Hugheses thriftily bought his house. Yet they -- the 
Hugheses -- were received by Hudson River Society; the Kennedys were not. 
</P>
<P>
Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
The figuring begins in the title -- "Gentleman Rebel" -- and continues, openly 
or by suggestion, through much of the rest of this memoir. Class is not so much 
the subject as the pathology. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes was a history professor at Harvard, Stanford and UC San Diego. He was a 
man of finely -- some might say fussily -- calibrated political compass points; 
not Center, nor Left, but oscillating variously between Left Left Center and 
Center Center Left. He was a premature skeptic of the Cold War, briefly for 
Henry Wallace, briefly a quixotic Senate candidate against Teddy Kennedy, and a 
lifelong pacifist. He was something of a failure by his own lights, and 
something of a success by most anyone else's. 
</P>
<P>
To read his reflections is to read the handwriting of somebody whose fingers 
were crippled by a birth defect, yet who has taught himself legibility, if not 
gracefulness. Hughes writes about childhood privilege as a West Virginia coal 
miner's son might write about childhood malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
His book is rickety, accordingly. There are moments of sense and sensibility, 
and moments of a drifting silliness. Hughes is aware that the upper-class state 
he writes of with such insistence is dotted with eccentricity. He is partly 
rueful and partly rather proud. 
</P>
<P>
He writes, for example, that his father, a successful corporate lawyer, was so 
sheltered -- not to mention strait-laced -- that he had to be instructed about 
condoms after his wife gave birth to two children in rapid succession. It was 
the Chief Justice -- a worldly Welshman under a patrician and Anglophile 
demeanor -- who did the instructing. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these things may be worth talking about; certainly, his linkage of the 
family's code of high-minded duty and his childhood sense of depression is 
interesting. But there is an involuntary priggishness in the language he uses; 
as if recollection were not discovery so much as one more high-minded duty. 
</P>
<P>
Yet under the altruism of privilege there is also privilege's 
inconsequentiality and easy acceptance of what it thinks due to it. He 
volunteered for an artillery battalion, although he hated noise. He writes of 
what an encouragement and revelation it was to associate with the other 
enlisted men. After a while, though, he'd had enough equality. He secured a 
commission, bought himself a tailored second lieutenant's uniform, and joined 
the posh Washington nucleus of what was to become the OSS. "I had done my stint 
as an enlisted man," he writes without apparent irony. 
</P>
<P>
He had a pleasant war, serving in the intelligence unit in North Africa, and 
later touring liberated France with a jeep and a driver to report on the 
political network set up by the Resistance. There, and in his subsequent 
political intelligence work in postwar Europe, he developed a sympathy for the 
Democratic Left. He deplored the postwar purge of leftists from the American 
intelligence community. One of his subordinates, for example, was Herbert 
Marcuse. "How can I be expected to run a balanced intelligence show when I take 
away my Communists," he protested at one point. 
</P>
<P>
That was "reckless beyond belief," he now recalls. In today's perspective, his 
belief that the extreme polarization of the Cold War could have been avoided 
seems appealing; particularly since he admits that he is not certain that he 
was right. At the time, no doubt, he must have seemed considerably more 
certain; and his academic career suffered for a while under the attacks of the 
Cold Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
Silly, high-minded, blinkered and sometimes courageously prescient, Hughes 
comes through in his memoirs with genuine, if frail, charm; at least until the 
later chapters, which turn into a kind of family Christmas newsletter. He 
belonged not to an endangered species but to one that is all but extinct; and 
if the world would be poorer for lack of snail darters, it loses a bit of 
buoyancy and originality with the passing of its Hugheses.

Nose for News: In a seesaw battle for afternoon news ratings, it appears that 
once-dominant KNBC Channel 4 has reclaimed the ratings lead it lost to KABC 
Channel 7 during the November ratings sweeps. With anchorwoman Christine Lund 
back after a four-year hiatus, Channel 7 picked up 90,000 households to finish 
first at 4 in November and also edged KNBC at 5. CLAUDIA PUIG

STAGE WATCH: MORALITY IS THEME OF TAPER, TOO SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taper, Too will open an unusual season in February: three plays by European 
writers. Not one of the productions will be a bona fide Los Angeles premiere, 
and no local directors will be involved. 
</P>
<P>
On tap are Moliere's "Don Juan," directed by Travis Preston, Feb. 5-March 3; 
Bertolt Brecht's "The Wedding," directed by Vladimir Strnisko, March 19-April 
14, and Heiner Muller's "The Task," directed by L. Kenneth Richardson, May 
7-June 2. 
</P>
<P>
All of the plays examine various forms of "accepted morality," according to a 
Taper press release. 
</P>
<P>
The 99-seat Taper, Too often is considered the Taper's arena for grass roots 
experimentation. The Taper Lab presents new-play workshops there, using many 
local playwrights, each fall. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Los Angeles writer John Steppling's "The Thrill" graduated from the 
Lab to a full production at the Taper, Too, and in the past such new plays as 
"In the Belly of the Beast" and "Stand-Up Tragedy" moved up from Taper, Too to 
mainstage productions. 
</P>
<P>
But next year's productions date from 1665 ("Don Juan"), 1926 ("The Wedding") 
and 1980 ("The Task"). All three plays have been previously produced in Los 
Angeles, though "The Task" was seen here under a different title, "The Mission" 
(1988, in a production by KitchenCollective at the Museum of Contemporary Art 
and the Wallenboyd Theatre). 
</P>
<P>
Next year's playwrights are French and German. And the directors live in New 
York, New Jersey and Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Preston, the New Yorker, has directed in the East and in Europe, where his 
feature film "Astonished" has won attention at film festivals. Richardson has 
worked at the Taper ("The Colored Museum," 1988) and the Taper Lab, but he 
lives in New Jersey, where he formerly directed Crossroads Theatre Company. 
</P>
<P>
Strnisko runs an avant-garde theater in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, that was 
closed due to government pressure under the former regime; this will be his 
U.S. debut. The Taper discovered him when a Taper troupe appeared in Bratislava 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to use the Taper, Too in different ways," said Taper artistic director 
Gordon Davidson. "There was great interest in these three directors right now, 
and there were no plays (from this year's Taper Lab) we wanted to develop to 
the next stage at this moment, though there are longer-range plans for some of 
them. Also, the planning of Taper, Too has to go on before the (Lab) festival 
is over." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson pointed to his use of local directors in the "50/60" series on the 
mainstage last spring, and said that more such opportunities will arise should 
the Taper ever be able to expand into the 250-350-seat second space that he has 
long coveted. 
</P>
<P>
Salonga in 'Saigon'?: Is Lea Salonga a "star" or "an actor providing unique 
services"? 
</P>
<P>
She must fit at least one of those descriptions for Actors' Equity to allow her 
-- or any foreigner -- to star on Broadway. There are indications that Equity 
is questioning Salonga's credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Cameron Mackintosh had asked Equity for permission for 19-year-old 
Salonga, a Filipina, to re-create her title role in London's "Miss Saigon" on 
Broadway, claiming he couldn't find an Asian-American actress for the role. 
According to the New York Times, an Equity council meeting deliberated four 
hours Tuesday before deciding to pass the decision to a panel consisting of an 
arbitrator, two Mackintosh representatives and two Equity representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Equity officials and Mackintosh declined comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to her biography in the program for "Miss Saigon," Salonga had 
appeared in 11 plays and six movies, sung on five albums, and received six 
awards -- all in the Philippines -- before "Miss Saigon." Her ultimate goal is 
to be a doctor, according to the bio. 
</P>
<P>
The Salonga dispute occurs in the same week as hearings before the New York 
City Commission on Human Rights about discrimination on the New York stage. The 
hearings were inspired by the controversy over the hiring of Salonga's Welsh 
co-star, Jonathan Pryce, to re-create his London role in New York. He plays a 
Eurasian character, and Asian-American activists within Equity said that an 
Asian actor should play the role. 
</P>
<P>
Redgrave in 'Lettice'?: Vanessa Redgrave is likely to take over Maggie Smith's 
starring role in "Lettice and Lovage" when the comedy goes on tour, say Shubert 
Organization officials, who co-produce the play and whose Shubert Theatre in 
Century City is one of the theaters under consideration for the tour. There 
have been reports that Smith was concerned about the size of the theaters on 
the tour, including the Century City Shubert; Shubert officials declined to 
comment.

INQUIRIES INTO REUSE OF AIDS NEEDLE AT MERCY NEAR AN END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County and state authorities are wrapping up separate investigations into 
medical practices at Mercy Hospital, where a 23-year-old San Diego woman 
received an injection from a syringe used previously on a patient with AIDS, 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Bold, senior health physicist for the San Diego County Department of 
Health Services, said he has interviewed executives at Mercy Hospital in 
Hillcrest and next week will complete interviews with the two technicians most 
closely connected to the case. 
</P>
<P>
The medical aide who administered the injection -- to a patient who had entered 
the hospital complaining of back pain -- is no longer employed by Mercy, said 
spokeswoman Laura Avallone. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're continuing to cooperate with the state Department of Health 
Services and have received no official notification about anything," Avallone 
said. "They're continuing their ongoing investigation, as is the County 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't predict what will happen, and I don't want to speculate. I'll just say 
we're cooperating with the state. We've been told that our response to the 
patient and to the state has been very positive and very upfront, and we're 
continuing along that path." 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Trujillo, San Diego manager for the state Department of Health Services, 
said he has concluded interviews with Mercy Hospital personnel and will soon 
file a report with the state office. Trujillo, whose inquiry pertains only to 
licensing, has said the worst that could happen would be a review that would 
cause Mercy's certification to be re-evaluated on federal and state levels. 
</P>
<P>
Bold's report also is intended primarily for state hospital licensing 
authorities. Bold said his inquiry will be forwarded to the Radiologic Health 
Branch of the state Department of Health Services. The patient involved had 
received a bone scan, which required the injection of a radioisotope dye, Bold 
said, meaning that the aspects of the case "pertaining to nuclear medicine also 
will be reviewed." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials have admitted that the syringe used by the technician had 
previously been used on a patient who suffered from the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital president Dick Keyser said last month, however, that the medical risk 
to the patient was "limited." Although it is true that she received an 
injection, Keyser said, the needle was inserted, not directly into the skin, 
but through a tube attached to her body. 
</P>
<P>
Keyser admitted that the hospital made a mistake and said the needle -- like 
any "used" needle -- should have been disposed of immediately. Keyser has 
declined to say how the mistake was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Levine, the attorney representing the patient -- whose name has not been 
released -- was unavailable for comment Wednesday. But Levine said he plans to 
file suit against Mercy, after the requisite 90-day waiting period involved in 
medical malpractice actions. The incident occurred Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier interviews, Levine said the woman entered the hospital with an 
"insignificant lower-back injury" she incurred at work. He said a worker's 
compensation doctor had ordered a bone scan, which led to the injection of 
radioisotope dye. He said the woman was informed of the hospital's "screw-up" 
36 hours later, at 1:15 a.m., after being awakened by a phone call from 
administrators at Mercy. 
</P>
<P>
"She was then told she had been injected with a syringe used previously on a 
patient known to be HIV-positive, and that the same syringe, instead of being 
disposed of by the attending technician, was then used on her," Levine said. 
"They refused to explain how or why such a mistake occurred." 
</P>
<P>
Medical authorities say it can't be known at least for several months whether 
the woman has been infected.

WOUNDED SALVATION ARMY WORKER DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MONICA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 61-year-old Salvation Army supervisor who was accidentally shot in the head 
with a gun left in a bag of donations has died, and El Cajon police said they 
will go through receipts given out by workers in an effort to determine who 
might have dropped off the pistol. 
</P>
<P>
James Irwin Brower, 61, of Alpine died Tuesday evening at UC San Diego Medical 
Center, several hours after being shot by co-worker Connie (C. W.) Wayne 
Overby, 51. 
</P>
<P>
Overby was looking at the gun at a Salvation Army collection center after 
picking it up off the ground, where it had fallen from donated goods. He 
accidentally discharged it, firing one round and hitting Brower in the head, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Bob Lein said the results of his department's investigation will be 
turned over to the San Diego County district attorney's office, which will 
determine whether any charges, such as negligence, will be filed against 
Overby. The Police Department is "not actively pursuing criminal charges," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe the pistol, a .22-caliber Derringer that holds two 
rounds, was either dropped by someone or fell out of a bag of donated items at 
the center operated by Brower and Overby. The two men received clothes, 
appliances and furniture at the back of a trailer in the parking lot of 
Kaelin's Market on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
"The gun was not turned in as a separate item," Lein said. "The person (who 
left the gun) did not tell them or did not know to tell them that the gun was 
among the property being dropped off." 
</P>
<P>
Police will also seek to find the owner of the gun through its registration. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Russell, director of community relations with the Salvation Army in San 
Diego County, said organization officials are reviewing their policy involving 
donations. He said the group does not accept firearms and that, had the men 
known the gun was being donated, they would not have accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is a first for the group, Russell said. He said it is being 
reviewed in an attempt to assure that nothing like it happens again. 
</P>
<P>
All employees and volunteers are being asked to be careful when receiving 
anything in a bag or box, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine it happening again, and I pray to God it doesn't happen 
again," Russell said. "It is just something you don't expect to happen, but 
again, we are going to take every precaution and inform our employees and 
volunteers to be very careful." 
</P>
<P>
Brower had worked for the Salvation Army for several years.

SEA WORLD WANTS TO USE 30 CITY ACRES; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISM: THEME PARK PROPOSES TO DIVIDE PARKLAND AREA INTO PUBLIC ATHLETIC 
FIELDS, BUT USE IT FOR OVERFLOW PARKING DURING PEAK SEASON AND HOLIDAYS. 
</P>

<P>
Sea World officials unveiled a proposal Wednesday to expand their parking lot 
onto 30 acres of city-owned land on Mission Bay on which a long-awaited city 
park is planned. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which will need City Council approval, calls for Sea World to 
spend up to $3 million to convert the 30 acres into essentially a large lawn 
divided into several baseball diamonds and athletic fields, some of which would 
be lighted for night games. 
</P>
<P>
Sea World would pay to maintain the fields, which would remain under the city's 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Sea World wants exclusive access to the fields and grassy area 
during peak attendance periods at the aquatic theme park -- so it can park 
about 3,500 cars. Sea World officials say peak periods are July, August and 
school holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The need for overflow parking is not great now, Sea World officials told a City 
Council committee Wednesday, but the company's projections show that attendance 
will nearly double by 2008, to 6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The 30 acres are next to Sea World's ocean of asphalt-covered parking lots, 
which accommodate about 6,600 vehicles. The land Sea World wants is part of the 
city's 100-acre South Shores Park, which has been in planning for at least 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the city began work on the first phase of the park, which 
encompasses the 30 acres Sea World is seeking. The city has spent about $2 
million grading the former landfill site and building a boat ramp and public 
restroom. 
</P>
<P>
It plans to spend another $2 million or so finishing the first phase by doing 
more grading and landscaping, building a 9-acre lagoon, an asphalt parking lot, 
a small beach and public pier, said John Leppart, an assistant to the city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
The city is scheduled to get bids for the project in March. The other phases of 
the park, which aren't completely funded, would include more parking and large 
picnic areas. The finished park would cost about $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the South Shores park is based in part on money from state grants 
and state park bonds. Sea World wants the city to ask those agencies whether a 
change in park plans to accommodate Sea World would delay or harm the city's 
access to the funds. 
</P>
<P>
The council's Public Facilities and Recreation Committee agreed Wednesday to do 
that, and city staffers said they expect to have an answer sometime next month. 
</P>
<P>
The committee stressed that it is not endorsing Sea World's proposal, and Sea 
World of California President Robert K. Gault said the proposal is still 
conceptual. 
</P>
<P>
Although the configuration of the first phase of South Shores park would 
change, Gault said all the elements for the public, such as the boat ramp, 
would still be open even when Sea World has to use the playing fields for 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
As planned by the city, a large part of the land Sea World wants to plant with 
grass and use for overflow parking is designated as an asphalt-covered parking 
lot. Under Sea World's plan, the parking lot would be moved and reshaped. 
</P>
<P>
Gault told reporters that people who use the playing fields during slack 
periods at Sea World could park in Sea World's lots. 
</P>
<P>
"In direct benefits to the city, Sea World contributes more rent income based 
on Sea World revenue than any other city tenant," Gault told the council 
committee. A Sea World spokesman said later that Sea World paid the city about 
$4 million in rent alone last year. Sea World's lease with the city runs until 
2033. 
</P>
<P>
Gault told reporters that it would be too expensive to build a multistory 
parking garage on Sea World's existing lots because of city height limits and 
the high ground-water table. 
</P>
<P>
The need for more parking will be exacerbated, Gault told the committee, 
because Sea World plans to turn 11 acres of what is now an asphalt-covered 
parking lot into an exhibit area. He declined to give details about the new 
exhibits because he doesn't want to tip off competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Several people backed Sea World's proposal, including a spokesman for the Old 
Mission Beach Athletic Club, said there is a great need in the beach area for 
playing fields. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, though, was ready to endorse the proposal, at least not without 
more analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Swink of Citizens Coordinate for Century 3, an urban planning group, 
recommended that Sea World find another way to accommodate its visitors, 
transportation alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
She warned that giving Sea World exclusive use of much of the 30 acres for 
parking would come at a time -- the middle of summer -- when use of Mission Bay 
by local residents is at its highest.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego leads California cities in the number of assault weapons registered 
under a new state law, but the state Justice Department says the registered 
arms are only a tiny fraction of those possessed by gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department reported Tuesday that 231 assault weapons -- including 
Uzis, AK-47s, MAC-10s and similar guns -- were registered in San Diego during 
the past 18 months. San Diego, California's second-largest city, has about 1.2 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, people who owned assault weapons before June, 1989, and register 
them before Dec. 31 of this year are legally entitled to keep them.

DOCTOR'S TAX CONVICTION MAY LEAD TO SANCTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ROLLING HILLS PLASTIC SURGEON SENTENCED TO SIX MONTHS FOR INCOME TAX 
EVASION. A STATE MEDICAL BOARD MAY TAKE DISCIPLINARY ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A South Bay plastic surgeon who was sentenced to six months in custody this 
week for evading more than $665,000 in federal taxes will face possible 
sanctions by the state board governing medical practices. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lawrence Saks, 39, of Rolling Hills, is being accused by the Medical Board 
of California of engaging in "unprofessional conduct" because of the income tax 
evasion, said Ron Kraemer, the board's assistant chief of enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
The accusation follows Saks' sentencing Monday to three months in federal 
prison and three months in a halfway house for his conviction on one count each 
of tax evasion and filing a false tax return. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the jail time, District Judge Ronald S. W. Lew ordered Saks to 
perform 1,500 hours of community service and pay a $200,000 fine. Saks also 
must pay the back taxes and about $1.1 million in interest and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Saks' attorney, Bruce I. Hochman, called the judge's sentence fair, and 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Jeffrey Eglash, who prosecuted the case, agreed that "it's 
an appropriate sentence for this case." 
</P>
<P>
Saks declined to answer phone calls to his office in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Kraemer said the medical board's accusation against Saks, which is currently 
being drafted by the state attorney general's office, would probably result in 
a disciplinary action somewhere between public reprimand and permanent 
revocation of his license, which are the minimum and maximum penalties. 
</P>
<P>
In a felony conviction that does not involve patient neglect, a doctor would 
probably be "looking at free community service, an ethics course and continuing 
education," Kraemer said, stressing that he was not talking specifically about 
Saks' case. 
</P>
<P>
Kraemer said once the accusation against Saks is drafted, it could take six 
months to schedule a hearing. A decision by the board would follow within 30 
days of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
At San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, where Saks is on the staff, officials are 
"very concerned" about Saks' conviction and will consider action once they 
receive official word of the sentencing, said hospital President John Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Saks, who also has an office in Torrance, had pleaded guilty in September to 
one count of tax evasion and one count of filing false federal income tax 
returns. The pleas followed a yearlong Internal Revenue Service investigation 
that found that between 1984 and 1987 Saks routinely cashed the checks of his 
patients rather than depositing them in his business bank account. 
</P>
<P>
During the three-year period, Eglash said, Saks cashed more than 1,500 business 
checks totaling $892,000, none of which was deposited or reported as income. 
Eglash described 1986 as the year Saks pocketed the most income, failing to pay 
more than $183,000 in taxes on his individual 1986 tax return and another 
$223,000 owed by his corporation for the fiscal year ending June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In pleading guilty to the two counts, Saks acknowledged evading the equivalent 
of about $200,000 in taxes in 1986, Eglash said. In exchange for that plea, the 
U.S. attorney's office did not pursue additional charges. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme, coupled with a booming, well-advertised plastic surgery practice, 
helped Saks accumulate property on the Palos Verdes Peninsula and in San Pedro, 
Long Beach and Inglewood that made him the envy of his local colleagues. Saks 
lives in a $2.3-million house in Rolling Hills and owns an interest in the 
Peninsula Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
His vigorous self promotion -- his advertisements in Cosmopolitan magazine and 
local publications featured shapely young women and his special phone number 
54-PLAST -- irritated some colleagues in the local medical Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"He's somewhat against the current of the rest of the South Bay plastic 
surgeons," one competitor said after learning of the charges against Saks. 
"There's always been an unspoken agreement here to stay away from advertising." 
</P>
<P>
The state board's proceeding against Saks marks the only time that the 1977 
graduate of McGill University School of Medicine, in Montreal, has faced 
disciplinary action since he received his California medical license in 1978.

2 FOES OF SCHOOL TEXTS RUN FOR REDONDO BEACH BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two members of a conservative Christian group that tried unsuccessfully to ban 
a series of textbooks in Redondo Beach have launched campaigns for open seats 
on the city's elementary school board. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Safani and Melinda Stone, two homemakers making their first bid for public 
office, will join local chiropractor Donna Carrico and incumbent Trustees 
Sylvia Zellers, Valerie Dombrowski and Bart Swanson in a six-way race for the 
three contested seats in the March 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need at least a mixture of thought on the board," said Stone, a 
36-year-old mother of two who tried earlier this year to persuade the board to 
shelve the Impressions series of grade school readers. "I felt the school board 
would not listen to us." 
</P>
<P>
School board members said this week that they are not surprised at the 
challenge, but said the job, especially now, during merger talks among the 
beach city schools, requires trustees with a broad perspective on school and 
community issues. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the protest early this year, Stone, Safani and other members of 
the Coalition of Concerned Parents -- a group of about 100 mostly conservative 
Christian residents -- had pointed to stories and poems about monsters and 
witches to buttress their arguments that the Impressions readers were 
frightening and anti-Christian and should be shelved. 
</P>
<P>
The school board rejected their demands in February, noting that any parent who 
wanted to could choose an alternative text as a matter of district policy. 
Moreover, the trustees added, the readers had been chosen after an exhaustive 
review process and had been the board's unanimous choice because of their 
emphasis on cultural diversity, imagination and literature. 
</P>
<P>
Angry members of the group vowed at the time to unseat the board incumbents, 
but as late as a week before the filing deadline, no challengers had emerged. 
</P>
<P>
Safani, 37, a parent and volunteer classroom aide, said she jumped into the 
race at the last minute at the behest of Stan Groman, another coalition member. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally was interested in seeing somebody run," Groman said, adding that 
he called Safani after he learned that the board incumbents might run 
unopposed. Although he did not know Safani personally, he said, he remembered 
her as one of several parents who had talked about mounting a political 
challenge to the board in the wake of the Impressions defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Safani said that after Groman's call, "I asked myself, 'Why not?' " 
</P>
<P>
Two-term incumbent Zellers said she was not surprised that the Impressions 
incident prompted a political challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"But I have a problem with any person running on a single issue for school 
board, no matter what the issue is," she said. "There are so many areas you 
have to be concerned with as a school board member." 
</P>
<P>
Zellers and other board members said trustees need to be familiar with, among 
other things, state funding mechanisms and bureaucracy, and labor relations, as 
well as with what goes on in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Safani and Stone said, however, that their concerns go beyond textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned, for instance, about the way they teach AIDS," Stone said. "I'm 
of the opinion there should be a strong push toward abstinence, and (classroom 
discussions on the epidemic) should start at the middle school level, not in 
elementary school." 
</P>
<P>
Safani added that, as an aide, she is concerned about class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers seem very frustrated and burned out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Carrico, 40, a chiropractor who moved to the district from Manhattan Beach in 
April, said she decided to run for school board as a means of "getting more 
involved in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Although she has two school-age children, neither of them has ever attended 
public school in Redondo Beach, she said. Her elder daughter attended private 
schools and was taught at home by Carrico until she was ready to attend Redondo 
Union High School, and her first-grader is enrolled at Riviera Hall, a private 
Lutheran School in Redondo Beach, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Carrico added, she has long been interested in education, and once 
considered a teaching career. 
</P>
<P>
"I see what's going on in the education system, and I see a lot of problems," 
she said. "This is just something I've always had on my agenda." 
</P>
<P>
None of the challengers felt ready to comment on the unification issue, a 
complex debate over whether the beach city schools should consolidate, to save 
money and improve efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
All of the incumbents, however, said unification is a primary reason why they 
chose to run again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd really like to see this unification thing through," said Swanson, the 
president of the elementary board. "We're right in the middle of it now, and 
it's going to take some time to get all the districts together." 
</P>
<P>
Dombrowski, a board member since 1979, said: "I've been through three of these 
(unification debates) now."

STATE GIVES HERMOSA ULTIMATUM TO LIMIT PARKING ALONG PCH; 
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC: CALTRANS TELLS THE CITY TO BAN EVENING RUSH-HOUR PARKING ON THE WEST 
SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY IN A BID TO EASE THE WEEKDAY COMMUTER LOGJAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After about 20 years of bureaucratic wrangling and who knows how many stalled 
commutes, Caltrans is forcing Hermosa Beach to clear out one of the most 
notorious bottlenecks on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter that arrived Monday at City Hall, the District 7 director of the 
state transportation agency gave the city until Feb. 1 to begin banning parking 
on the west side of Pacific Coast Highway during the evening rush hour. And if 
Hermosa Beach refuses, director J. B. Baxter warned, Caltrans will do the 
honors itself. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really going to cramp our style," groused Jerry Whisman, a sales 
manager for the city's biggest taxpayer, the Vasek Polak auto dealerships that 
line Pacific Coast Highway in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Our parking here is absolutely horrendous as it is. If they take away the 
parking out front, it'll definitely affect us." 
</P>
<P>
But City Manager Kevin Northcraft said the city's options are limited. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say?" Northcraft sighed. "After all, it's their road." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the daily rush-hour logjam that occurs on the southbound side of 
the highway, where Hermosa Beach has for decades permitted merchants to offer 
curbside parking. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Manhattan Beach to the north placed a rush-hour ban on such 
parking, clearing the far west lane for commuters. But despite pressure from 
the California Department of Transportation to follow suit, Hermosa Beach 
authorities refused, arguing that a parking ban in their city would put local 
merchants out of business and create an expressway in the heart of town. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Hermosa Beach has become a navigational annoyance for work-weary 
commuters who chug along by the thousands in three lanes through Manhattan 
Beach only to squeeze irritably into two at the city line. 
</P>
<P>
"I always know when I enter the city of Hermosa Beach because the traffic just 
stops!" complained a Lomita commuter in a 1989 letter to Caltrans that was 
forwarded to the city during Caltrans' most recent effort to win a parking ban. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has that been the only complaint to reach bureaucratic ears. This year, for 
example, the El Segundo Employers' Assn. brought up the Hermosa Beach logjam 
not only with the city and Caltrans, but also with the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Karl F. Berger, an associate transportation engineer for Caltrans, said the 
agency has always had legal authority to ban parking whether the city likes it 
or not. But the agency has always sought a joint restriction because Caltrans 
would have to rely on the city to enforce the ban. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, Berger said, the agency has become increasingly impatient 
with the city. Caltrans studies have shown that Hermosa Beach's stretch of 
Pacific Coast Highway has a higher accident rate than any similar stretch of 
the coast highway in Los Angeles County, with "almost double the amount of 
accidents that we would expect at this location." 
</P>
<P>
Berger said the Hermosa Beach section of the highway has 5.33 accidents per 
million vehicle miles, compared to the expected rate of 3.30. (A vehicle mile 
is a measure of the average amount of traffic on a stretch of roadway each 
day.) 
</P>
<P>
Other studies have shown that the single lane of parking inconveniences about 
56,000 drivers a day and costs them more than $650,000 a year in wasted 
gasoline and vehicle maintenance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been fighting this battle for 20 years," Berger said, "and through one 
change of administration after another, the city has stonewalled us. We had to 
take action. This is not just a local problem, but one of regional impact." 
</P>
<P>
Berger said the final straw came when the agency got a letter in October from 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation 
Committee. Noting that "the obstinacy of a single city" can sometimes be "a 
major obstacle to . . . common-sense projects," Katz wanted to know what 
Caltrans intended to do about the Hermosa Beach bottleneck. 
</P>
<P>
District Director Baxter's reply was to crack down on the city. 
</P>
<P>
Public Works Director Anthony Antich said he believes the move will only shift 
the bottleneck to the Redondo Beach city line, where the highway narrows to a 
width that can only accommodate two lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always doubted that this will be the panacea everybody expects," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach Mayor Chuck Sheldon added that the City Council will meet later 
this month to decide whether to contest the edict in court. The council, he 
said, is split on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, Sheldon said, he has mixed feelings about following through on the 
Caltrans ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are some people who say, 'Fine -- let 'em do it. We just won't 
enforce it,' " the mayor said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: APPARENT HOLDUP TARGET IS KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 39-year-old Los Angeles man was fatally wounded during an apparent robbery 
attempt at a parking lot of the McDonnell Douglas plant in the Harbor Gateway 
area, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified as Alfred Dean Corbin, was shot about 2:40 p.m. Monday 
after he was approached in the company parking lot in the 1400 block of 190th 
Street by three suspects who later fled in a white compact car. 
</P>
<P>
Corbin was taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said Corbin worked as a metal bonder. Records indicated 
that he was first employed by the company in 1971, but it was not known if he 
had worked for the firm continuously, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police, who are investigating, declined further comment on the killing.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LATCHKEY PROGRAM SEEKS CERTIFICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Carson City Council has decided to apply for state certification of a 
popular latchkey program, which the city closed at the end of November because 
it was operating without a state license. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 children were involved in the Kids Club program at the city's 12 
parks and community center. 
</P>
<P>
The program provided before- and after-school supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Tiny Tots day-care program for preschool children was also found to 
be operating without proper certification, according to the state Department of 
Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the city decided to file for state certification only for the Tiny 
Tots program. City officials said it would be too difficult to certify Kids 
Club, which requires program directors to have an academic degree in child 
development or experience in a day-care center, or a combination of both. 
</P>
<P>
However, many parents protested that decision, and Mayor Vera Robles DeWitt 
announced Tuesday that a subcommittee will be formed to examine the 
certification procedure for Kids Club, liability issues and fee structure. 
Members of the panel will include representatives of the parks, the 
Gardena/Carson YMCA, the Los Angeles Unified School District and two council 
members, DeWitt and Sylvia Muise.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REPORT ON HOTEL DRAWS CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The adequacy of an environmental impact report on a proposed 495-room resort 
hotel in Rancho Palos Verdes drew criticism Tuesday from about a dozen 
residents, including members of a newly formed environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
The project, proposed by the Monaghan Co., would be built on the former 
Marineland site and would include the hotel, a golf course and convention 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Gar Goodson, chairman of Save Our Coastline 2000, told the Planning Commission 
hearing that the impact statement is "seriously inadequate" because it does not 
discuss the project in relation to the city's General Plan, which discourages 
the construction of "industrial and major commercial activities due to the 
terrain and environmental characteristics of the city." The land is zoned for 
commercial and recreational use. 
</P>
<P>
Goodson and several other members of the group, which has about 150 members, 
most of them residents of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, said the new organization 
is dedicated to keeping commercial development off the bluffs that overlook the 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Today is the last day to submit written comment on the EIR. The commission 
directed the consultants who authored the EIR for the city to prepare a 
response to the public comments for a Feb. 4 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
When the document is complete, the Planning Commission may certify the report. 
The commission's decision can be appealed to the City Council.

COUNCIL APPROVES WATER PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL BEN-ALI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council has approved a $13.7-million water conservation 
program that it is estimated will save the city more than 300,000 gallons of 
water a day for five years. 
</P>
<P>
The program will distribute water-saving plumbing device kits, provide better 
response to water-waste complaints, and establish information, education, 
rebate and auditing programs, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the program will save enough water each year to supply 
16,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
"This one is a comprehensive, integrated, long-term voluntary water 
conservation program," said Marsi Steirer, a water conservation analyst for the 
city. Steirer said the program is unusual because, by collecting data from and 
following up on families that install the water-saving devices, the city will 
learn how San Diegans use water. 
</P>
<P>
But the water savings estimated in the plan were based on 80% of the households 
using the water-saving devices, Steirer said. "I really think that San Diegans 
are willing and ready to adopt the water conservation program that the council 
adopted." 
</P>
<P>
The program was passed on a 6-2 vote Monday, with Mayor Maureen O'Connor and 
Councilman Bruce Henderson dissenting.

GRANADA HILLS BLITZES CARSON, 93-80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps it was an involuntary motion, but Granada Hills High basketball Coach 
Bob Johnson rubbed the back of his neck as he analyzed his team's performance 
at Carson on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Have an ounce of pity for the poor guy, because if this is the pace at which 
his team is going to motor up and down the floor all season, he will almost 
certainly need a chiropractor. Or at the very least, a chair that swivels. 
</P>
<P>
"We happen to be able to score, I guess," Johnson said with a sly grin. "That's 
helpful." 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders, ranked No. 1 in the San Fernando Valley by The Times, again 
helped themselves to a ton of points, rolling to a 93-80 victory over Carson in 
a nonleague City Section game. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills (7-1) is now averaging a shade under 87 points a game -- and it 
would be higher if the Highlanders weren't being victimized by their own 
fast-breaking effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The score Ping-Ponged so rapidly during one breathtaking stage of the second 
quarter that the Carson scoreboard operator fell behind and the Granada Hills 
tally had to be adjusted upward by two points at halftime. The teams combined 
for 53 points in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Over the final three minutes of the second quarter, Granada Hills scored on 
seven consecutive shots from the floor to open a 53-38 lead at halftime. The 
Highlanders made 20 of 33 shots in the half (60.6%). 
</P>
<P>
"We work hard and never let down," said senior swingman Gene Barshtak, who 
scored a team-high 24 points, mostly on back-door lay-ins. "This is a good team 
this year. We're not going to lose again." 
</P>
<P>
Except maybe a bucket or two. Another scoring snafu awaited the Highlanders 
entering the fourth quarter, when the scoreboard operator and the keeper of the 
Carson score book shorted Granada Hills a basket. Despite scoring 20 points in 
the third quarter, the Highlanders were credited with 18 in the official book. 
When the discrepancy was pointed out to the officials, rather than again sort 
through the mess, they let the score stand as posted: Granada Hills 71, Carson 
55. Highlander forward Adrian Sellers, who scored 16 points, was officially 
credited with 14. 
</P>
<P>
Not that it really mattered. The Highlanders led, 34-14, with 6:15 left in the 
second quarter. By then, the Carson crowd started chanting, "Fooooootbaaaaall," 
in reference to Carson's 57-13 playoff shellacking of Granada Hills last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a pay-back," Barshtak said. "Some of the guys even wrote 'Pay-back' 
on their shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Carson, ranked No. 5 overall in the City by The Times, played without two 
starters, including 6-foot-9 junior center Khary Stanley, who is out with a 
back injury. Other than junior forward Rudy Washington (29 points) and senior 
guard Tyrone Smith (23), the remainder of the Carson roster played right into 
Granada Hills' collective hands. The pace was simply too much. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got eight or nine guys who can score," Johnson said. "If one guy can't 
get it done, somebody else usually does." 
</P>
<P>
Carson (4-4) mounted a minor rally in the third quarter to crawl as close as 
nine points, but Barshtak and Jerry Allen (23 points) kicked Granada Hills' 
offense back into high gear. Barshtak scored inside, then stole a pass at half 
court and scored on a lay-in to make it 82-67 with 3:42 left. Allen, who added 
seven rebounds and six assists, converted a three-point play with 1:21 left to 
give Granada Hills a 91-75 lead.

DAVIS' 26 POINTS LEAD MORNINGSIDE GIRLS TO 69-61 VICTORY OVER LYNWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Janet Davis hasn't made anyone forget Lisa Leslie yet, but the Morningside High 
center posted Leslie-like numbers Wednesday night to lead the girls' basketball 
team to its biggest victory of the young season. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a 6-foot-4 junior, had 26 points, 11 rebounds and nine blocked shots as 
Morningside defeated visiting Lynwood, 69-61, in the championship game of the 
Morningside Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was named tournament most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Monarchs (5-0) broke open a close game in the last four minutes. 
Sophomore forward Tina Thompson, who finished with 12 points and seven 
rebounds, hit a basket to break a 56-56 tie and later sank a three-point shot 
that put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Princess Murray, who has been slowed by a shoulder injury, also 
played well down the stretch for Morningside. She finished with five points and 
six assists.

BIG KIDS SPOIL FUN AS LEUZINGER ROLLS OVER HAWTHORNE, 76-65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
Leave it to the big kids to spoil all the fun for the little guys. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne and Leuzinger High Schools' youthful backcourt players were having a 
great time trading baskets -- just like a neighborhood pickup game -- in the 
first half of their El Segundo tournament semifinal game Wednesday night in the 
El Segundo High gym. 
</P>
<P>
That was before Leuzinger's big, bad seniors -- center Frank Willis and power 
forward Ty Merriweather -- started throwing bodies around in the second half. 
Willis and Merriweather were all business in leading Leuzinger to a 76-65 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
But this latest chapter of one of South Bay's most intense cross-town rivalries 
was fun while it lasted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like family out there," Leuzinger Coach Phil Sherman said. "The kids on 
both teams are all friends. You don't see too many tempers flare up out there." 
</P>
<P>
Sherman starts a pair of sophomores in his backcourt, while Hawthorne's Richard 
Wells starts a sophomore and a junior. In the first three quarters, the 
talented youngsters put on a show. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger sophomore Troy Matthews scored 10 of his 14 points -- including two 
three-point baskets -- before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
And 15-year-old sophomore Dominic Ellison scored 15 of his 17 in the half, 
including a pair of leaning jump shots from the baseline that brought Hawthorne 
a 39-39 tie at the buzzer. Ellison, a crafty ballhandler, added 13 assists on 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne junior Shanta Cotright finished with 17 points, but Leuzinger's 
Willis -- a 6-foot-8 post player -- dominated the boards and Merriweather took 
advantage by scoring several easy inside baskets to help the Olympians (3-0) 
pull away in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Willis finished with 17 points and Merriweather led all scorers with 19. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Robert Northern added 12 points for Leuzinger and sophomore Antwan 
Lewis scored eight. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger advances to meet the winner of tonight's 7:30 semifinal between El 
Segundo and Mira Costa in the championship game Friday night at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne dropped to 2-4.

FOR BANNING, 60 MINUTES OF TRAVIS DAVIS IS USUALLY GOOD NEWS; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: PILOTS' STAR RUNNING BACK ALSO EXCELS ON DEFENSE. THIS SEASON, 
HE EVEN HAD TO FILL IN FOR THE PUNTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As far as Travis Davis of Banning High is concerned, there hasn't been much 
rest for the weary. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the season, Davis has been running the ball 25 to 30 times a game 
as Banning's tailback. 
</P>
<P>
When Banning's offense is off the field, Davis mans the Pilots' right 
cornerback position. 
</P>
<P>
Since the playoffs began, he has been returning punts and kicks. 
</P>
<P>
And, as if Banning Coach Joe Dominguez couldn't think up enough tasks for his 
versatile 6-foot, 185-pound senior, he even had Davis punting for much of the 
season, when the regular punter was down with an injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't mind it, really," the soft-spoken Davis said. "I could kick pretty 
good. Anyway, punting gave me a little rest time." 
</P>
<P>
Except for one problem. With Banning's high-powered offense ripping off one 
long scoring drive after another, Davis hardly ever got a chance to punt. 
</P>
<P>
Which was OK, because Davis doesn't need much rest. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to be on the field the whole game," Davis said. "That way you feel like 
a part of it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez has since turned the punting chores over to placekicker Ricardo 
Robledo. But if Banning (9-3) is going to win the L.A. City 4-A Division 
championship Friday against Carson (11-1), expect Davis to play a major role. 
</P>
<P>
The game -- the 10th time the rival schools have met for the City title since 
1978 -- is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 12, Carson beat Banning, 41-14, in a Pacific League game. But Davis 
still rushed for 159 yards in 28 carries -- the most yards Carson has allowed 
to an opposing running back all season. 
</P>
<P>
Banning has won six of the previous nine City championship matchups against 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
But Carson has won the last two -- in 1986 and 1988 -- and Carson Coach Gene 
Vollnogle will be coaching in his last game before retirement, giving the Colts 
an emotional boost. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can beat them," Davis said. "We just have to play harder and 
eliminate the turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
A dominating, full-field performance by Davis wouldn't hurt, either. Two weeks 
ago, against Kennedy, Davis: 
</P>
<P>
Rushed for 108 yards, including a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Returned a kickoff from his own three-yard line, raced straight up the middle, 
broke a tackle, then cut back to the right sideline for a 97-yard touchdown 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Intercepted two passes and made a Kennedy receiver see stars with a devastating 
hit on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has rushed for 1,657 yards this season in 223 carries -- an average of 
7.4 yards per carry. He has scored 17 touchdowns on the ground, plus his 
scoring kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has surpassed 200 yards in three games this year -- against Dorsey, 
Gardena and Crenshaw -- and has reached the 100-yard mark on seven other 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey held Davis to 48 yards in Banning's 21-20 semifinal victory last week -- 
until the last play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
On that play, Davis ran a sweep to the right from 13 yards out, slashed back to 
the middle, and high-stepped into the end zone for the decisive touchdown with 
1:28 left to play. Robledo's extra point was the margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The blocking was the difference," Davis said, with characteristic modesty. 
"Everybody blocked as hard as they could and gave me a hole to the inside." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Davis leaves the laid-back approach on the sidelines. Once on the field, 
he thrives on contact. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to hit, even on offense," Davis said. "When I run the ball, I love it 
when there is just one guy who thinks he can take me down. I take the attitude 
that no one person can bring me down." 
</P>
<P>
What makes Davis such an attractive college prospect is his combination of 
toughness, strength and the speed to get outside, where he can isolate and run 
over defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
On Banning's track team last season, Davis ran a personal best of 10.8 seconds 
in the 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"Travis can do everything that great backs do," Dominguez said. "He can make 
the first guy miss a tackle, and then he can go right through the next guy. And 
he's got a natural high leg-kick action in his running stride. He can do it 
all." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Davis will visit USC for the first of his recruiting trips. He 
also has visits lined up to Washington, UCLA, Notre Dame and Stanford. Stanford 
is particularly interested in Davis, who is a bright student and excels in 
mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
All five colleges see Davis as a potential force on either offense or defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the college recruiters that I have spoken to think Travis can do just 
about anything," Dominguez said. "They say he can be a Division I running back 
or a Division I defensive back." 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, Davis was a full-time cornerback on Banning's varsity. He 
switched to running back the following season but missed nearly every game with 
a variety of ankle injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible," Davis said. "I wanted to play, but I had to sit there and 
watch everyone else go out there and have fun. I got frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
He won't be watching Friday.

<P>
Marsha Bell has four sons whom she lovingly calls "spoiled brats." 
</P>
<P>
Months before Christmas, they started asking for $200 computer games, their own 
televisions, their own Nintendos, Bo Jackson tennis shoes that cost three times 
what they usually pay for shoes, a drum set, an organ, their own rooms, even a 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
The Bells, who live in Mission Hills, say they provide just about everything 
their children want, but they know that if it weren't for a few strict rules 
and some longstanding family traditions, the boys' Christmas wish lists would 
get way out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, they see what other kids have; they're affected by peer pressure and the 
media hype on TV," said Bell, a mother who works part time at a school 
cafeteria. "We just have to somehow put a rein on it." 
</P>
<P>
The Bells, like many upper-middle-class San Fernando Valley families, are 
dealing with a growing trend among youths who focus more on materialism rather 
than the true spirit of the holidays. To offset that trend, religious leaders, 
teachers, counselors and therapists are diverting attention to the value of 
giving -- and deserving -- presents this Christmas and Hanukkah season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've created spoiled kids who find the holidays meaningless, except for what 
they can get out of them," said psychologist Stan W. Ziegler, who has been 
treating Valley families for 11 years. "They've lost the pleasure of giving or 
receiving gifts. So many of them have credit cards they can use to get whatever 
they want at any time." 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler, based in West Hollywood, has a 15-year-old client who gets a 
$1,500-a-month allowance. He warns that such unbridled extravagance prevents 
children from making responsible choices and can often be seen as a substitute 
for parental love -- leading to depression or drug abuse for the child. 
</P>
<P>
"The trick is to spend time together as a family and give gifts that aren't so 
materialistic -- like making each other presents, doing household chores for 
the day or serving parents breakfast in bed," Ziegler said. 
</P>
<P>
At their two-story house on a suburban cul-de-sac, Marsha Bell can often be 
seen joining her boys in a basketball game, if their motor home isn't parked in 
the driveway. Every year in early December, her husband, Jack, a regional 
supervisor for a tire company, and her sons, John, 19, Charles, 14, Zachary, 
13, and Joey, 11, all help unpack the large boxes of Christmas decorations. 
</P>
<P>
"One of us will design a scene for the mirror and another will put the lights 
on the tree," said Zachary, who attends Sepulveda Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, we all sleep under the tree in sleeping bags on Christmas Eve," said 
Charles, who attends the 32nd Street Magnet School. 
</P>
<P>
The boys each draw a name of one of their brothers to buy one big present of up 
to $50, rather than buying three small gifts. The presents are hidden 
throughout the house, resulting in an elaborate Christmas morning treasure hunt 
with puzzles and clues leading to each one. The hunt is made easier for Joey, 
who has cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
"The time we spend together is more important than what we give each other," 
said Marsha Bell, who is also concerned about keeping Zachary's December 
birthday separate from the Christmas celebration. "It must be horrible to have 
your birthday this month." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind," Zachary said, smiling. "All the good toys come out around 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Encino clinical psychologist Joseph Nicolosi said materialistic attitudes in 
children are a perennial problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The message we get from ads is that the next toy, the next pair of jeans, the 
next truck will bring us happiness -- it's so far away from the celebration of 
the birth of Jesus," said Nicolosi, who has been in practice for 15 years. 
"It's impossible to keep kids from those messages. My kid is a spoiled brat who 
comes from a pair of upper-middle-class obsessive compulsive parents." 
</P>
<P>
At home in Thousand Oaks, Nicolosi's 9-year-old son Joey is constantly revising 
his long list of gifts -- although a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle is always on 
top. Joey has a tree house, a pool and three versions of every toy -- according 
to his father, who is often frustrated trying to teach his son values. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk about the Nativity scene and set it up together," Nicolosi said. 
"We're also going to see my big Catholic family back East -- my first time back 
in 12 years -- and that will show Joey a way of sharing. You have to with 38 
cousins." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time this year, Joey is going out on his own to buy his parents a 
gift with money he has earned by walking the dog and doing chores. "Joey's real 
excited about getting us something," Nicolosi said with some hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
Greed and materialism are issues discussed at a seminar taught at private and 
public Valley schools by Berenda Hunter, a counselor who works for St. Anne's 
Maternity Home in Van Nuys. In the seminar, given free to schools that invite 
her, Hunter adds up the thousands of dollars worth of tennis shoes in the class 
and then teaches the students to feel good about themselves as individuals, and 
not by what they own. 
</P>
<P>
"We are creating little monsters," said Hunter, a parenting consultant for 15 
years. "When you give an 11-year-old a $75 M.C. Hammer ticket just because she 
asks for it, you are not producing what could be a productive adult." 
</P>
<P>
As a single working mother living in Agoura Hills, Hunter doesn't spend as much 
time as she would like with her 10-year-old son Ryan. But when they are 
together, she said, they read books together, play, and talk about work and 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Parental guilt caused because they don't spend time with their children is 
something that triggers materialistic attitudes, said child psychologist Marga 
Rosa, who has run the San Fernando Valley Stepfamily Assn. in Woodland Hills 
since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"The child is given everything they could ever want, yet is being neglected," 
Rosa said. "The problem is no one ever says 'no.' And it's too late to do that 
when they get older." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of giving gifts must be instilled at an early age, said Dr. Herbert 
Blaufarb, outpatient director of the San Fernando Valley Child Guidance Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't raise a child to be compassionate only during one time a year," 
Blaufarb said. "They have to know how to share and how to earn presents. There 
are times when you have to say the child can't have that Ninja Turtle toy, and 
you will have to deal with the fact that the child despises you at the moment. 
You can't raise a child with guilt." 
</P>
<P>
So many Valley parents have their own busy schedules and have little time 
together, said the Rev. Roberta Johnson, a youth pastor for six Lutheran 
churches in Van Nuys, Chatsworth, Northridge and Granada Hills. It's standard 
among some of the wealthy families in her congregations to give new imported 
cars to teen-agers for their high school graduations, said Johnson, who drives 
a 1979 Thunderbird. 
</P>
<P>
"But as busy as they are, some families take time to do something for others on 
the holidays that opens their children's eyes to those who are less fortunate, 
like help feed homeless at a mission," Johnson said. "The children are 
surprised to see that not everyone has two homes, four cars and a yacht, and 
they begin to learn that things have to be earned." 
</P>
<P>
The get-rich-quick attitude is shifting in America, Johnson said, and families 
are focusing on taking care of the environment and each other. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers in danger of becoming spoiled by their wealth have completely 
changed their outlook after helping with a weekend church construction project 
in Tijuana, Mexico, said Dana Hanson, associate pastor at the First Lutheran 
Church of Northridge. Even Hanson's 2-year-old has carried fresh-picked oranges 
to the altar to present to poor families in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see on their faces how much the act of giving brings them joy, even 
the little ones," Hanson said. "If they say they want Nintendos and don't care 
about poor people, the answer should be that wealth is only beneficial if it 
can help others." 
</P>
<P>
One of Hanson's youth leaders, Tim Gulsrud, 15, who lives in Bell Canyon, said 
he is hinting to his friends that he would like to take them one weekend to 
help build the church in Mexico. He tells his rich friends at Calabasas High 
School stories about the people he has helped. 
</P>
<P>
"My school has a reputation for being excessively materialistic. I mean, I know 
kids who get a Porsche for getting good grades," Tim said. "There are a few of 
my friends I'd like to invite to show them what it's like helping others like 
this, but I have to do it gently." 
</P>
<P>
But even a pastor's family falls prey to the pressures of their peers, such as 
when the Rev. Larry Thomas' children said they wanted the air-cushioned Michael 
Jordan pump tennis shoes that cost $135. Thomas, who has a congregation of 90 
families at Holy Shepherd Lutheran Church in Chatsworth, told them that he 
would pay only the amount for the average cost of tennis shoes, but anything 
stylistic that cost more would have to be paid for by his children -- two boys 
and two girls, ages 15, 12, 9 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
"That way, we're not saying they can't have what they want; we're saying they 
must earn it," said Ann Thomas, their mother. "In our community, our children's 
friends seem to have far more material things than we do, yet our children seem 
to keep their requests reasonable -- most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
Another practice at the Thomas house is holding back 10% of all the children's 
allowances and pooling their money to give to someone anonymously at 
Christmastime, teaching them the spirit of giving. 
</P>
<P>
"The children decide among themselves who it goes to -- sometimes it's a 
friend, sometimes it's a stranger," said their mother, who sent her children's 
money last year to a Korean priest helping orphans. "They really enjoy giving 
it and they've never objected to giving away a portion of their allowance." 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, "of course, they have no choice."

BARGAINS: ECOLOGY-LOVERS' CHRISTMAS TREE: IT'S RENTED 
</P>

It's a great time of year to rent items that we usually buy and save some big 
bucks. The most unusual rental around probably is Rent-a-Tree, a promotional 
service offered by Ikea that seems to be taking Los Angeles by storm. Here's 
the deal: 
</P>
<P>
The trees are live Douglas firs shipped from Vancouver, B. C., and measure here 
from 5 1/2 feet to 7 feet tall. The cost is $10 for the rental with a $10 
deposit. You are given a "Tree Lease" and, when you return the tree Jan. 5 or 
12, your deposit is returned or Ikea will give you a $20 gift certificate 
applicable to a purchase of $100 or more. 
</P>
<P>
This is such a good deal that Ikea's 5,000-tree inventory should go fast. If, 
by chance, the trees are gone by the time you get there, consider the 2- to 
3-feet live Italian stone pines, decorated with Swedish-style ornaments, for 
$9. 
</P>
<P>
 Ikea, 600 N. San Fernando Road, Burbank, (818) 842-4532. Hours 10 a.m. to 9 
p.m. Mondays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Sundays. MasterCard/Visa. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, it's traditional that men rent their tuxedos and women buy 
their party dresses. When you give it some thought, it makes more sense the 
other way around. Men should buy a tux, and women should rent that party dress. 
</P>
<P>
Styles change so little in men's tuxedos that the $150 plus it takes to 
purchase one is an investment that will hold for several years. On the other 
hand, a good special-occasion dress costs upwards of $300 and usually is worn 
only once or twice. 
</P>
<P>
Renting a gown costs a fraction of the retail price of the garment. At Starlit 
Soiree, the price range for rentals is $50 to $195; the $50 rental dress would 
sell in the area of $300, and the one at $195 would retail from $900 to $1,200. 
A deposit equal to the amount of the rental is required upfront. 
</P>
<P>
 Starlit Soiree is in Beverly Hills at 8950 W. Olympic Blvd. (213) 275-5570). 
Hours 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Mondays to Saturdays or by appointment. 
MasterCard/Visa/American Express. 
</P>
<P>
 The gown rentals at One Night Affair start at $35, and the top rental price is 
$150. A $600 black Victor Costa gown was renting for $60 the day I checked. 
It's cash or check only. The deposit is your credit card number. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed to Kill has rentals that begin at $100 and top out at $350 for gowns 
valued at up to $12,000. Bob Mackie, for instance, costs $200 to wear for an 
evening -- certainly a small price to dazzle everyone in an original Bob 
Mackie. A damage deposit of $250 is required. 
</P>
<P>
 One Night Affair, 3222 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica, (213) 453-7782. By 
appointment between 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed to Kill, 8762 Holloway Drive, West Hollywood, (213) 652-4334. By 
appointment only. 
</P>
<P>
 JEWELRY GEMS: Metro Jewelry, a local manufacturer of costume jewelry that is 
seen in many Southern California stores, will be selling its excess stock at 
wholesale and below at its factory in Van Nuys this weekend. The inventory is 
heavy on duster earrings, the kind that dust your shoulders, which 
fashion-conscious women are sporting these days. 
</P>
<P>
This merchandise is not for the timid, but for those who like their jewelry 
kinetic and colorful. Just about everything will be $10 and under. For example, 
earrings that retail for $38 will go for $10. Bracelets that are usually $24 
will be tagged $6 to $8. The sale is Saturday only from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Metro Jewelry, 15825 Stagg St., Van Nuys, (818) 988-1900. Cash or check only. 
</P>
<P>
 HOT LAST-MINUTE BUYS: Three extraordinary deals are being offered at H.R.D. 
Distributors that could fill any gaps on your gift list. Shaker knit sweaters 
(for men and women) that retail for $38 are sailing out in several colors at 
$9.75. Jimmy Z outer-wear jackets (they're $75 at most stores) won't last long 
at $28. And if these aren't hot enough for you . . . L.A. Gear long-sleeve 
T-shirts selling around town for $18 to $20 are all tagged at $3.85. From $18 
to $3.85! Now THAT'S a bargain! 
</P>
<P>
 H.R.D. Distributors, 18318 Oxnard St., Unit 4, Tarzana, 818-708-1941. Cash, 
checks only.

LIKE THE SEASONS, HISTORY COMES FULL CIRCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley was never meant for farming. 
</P>
<P>
This place had suitable soil. It had a warm climate. But it didn't have much 
water. 
</P>
<P>
So the Tongva and Chumash Indians who originally inhabited the San Fernando 
Valley were hunters and gatherers. They survived off vegetation that grew 
naturally and off an abundance of wild animals. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until hundreds of years later -- with the tapping of ground water and 
the construction of the Los Angeles-Owens Valley Aqueduct -- that this 
naturally arid region was converted to agricultural land. By the early 1900s, 
the irrigated Valley had become a vast bowl of wheat fields and fruit orchards, 
stretching hundreds of acres in every direction. 
</P>
<P>
But history has a way of turning back on itself, and Valley farms are now as 
rare as they were in the days of the Tongva and Chumash. 
</P>
<P>
Suburban sprawl -- houses and office buildings and strip malls spilling over 
the hill from the Los Angeles Basin -- have squeezed farmers out. 
</P>
<P>
According to county records, there were only a dozen Valley farmers producing 
about $5 million worth of crops in 1985. By the start of this year, only half a 
dozen farmers remained, and the annual crop had dwindled to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Joe Cicero -- a third-generation farmer from Woodland Hills who is 
down to his last 15 acres and may soon be forced out of business -- applies to 
all farmers in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting harder and harder," said Tom Tapia, whose grandfather founded 
Tapia Bros. Farm in the Sepulveda Basin. Because the Tapias work 100 acres of 
government land, they do not have to battle commercial interests. But the 
government is gradually converting the basin into parkland. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there will be a day when there won't be any farming land left," Tapia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Kemper, who used to work in the Valley as a county agricultural inspector, 
recalls times that were much different. 
</P>
<P>
"Olives and peaches and oranges," Kemper said. "Everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The race to develop began around 1942, he recalled. Kemper is retired, but he 
still keeps track of agriculture in the Valley and has watched it dwindle as 
fields are paved over. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to look like Singapore pretty soon," he said. "With the value of 
land, you can't afford to grow crops. You're not going to plant an acre of 
strawberries in the middle of New York City." 
</P>
<P>
The irony, Kemper said, is that the irrigated Valley offers ideal conditions 
for growing. Yet farmers are being forced to drier, less suitable areas. 
</P>
<P>
"You ought to be building homes in the middle of the desert. They can afford to 
pump water into homes. They can air-condition homes," he said. "Those things 
aren't affordable for farming." 
</P>
<P>
According to county records, the few farmers remaining in the Valley grow 
vegetables and herbs. 
</P>
<P>
One of those farmers is Robert Dedlow, who started in agriculture only five 
years ago. He turned a back-yard hobby of growing herbs and lettuce into Kenter 
Canyon Farms, which sells to restaurants and has three lots in the East Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Although his business requires little land -- each plot is five acres -- Dedlow 
has nonetheless felt the urban push. 
</P>
<P>
"We run into problems with neighbors," he said. "People complain about our open 
fields. There are residential neighborhoods that like to see only other 
residences around them." DAVID WHARTON

HIGH-TECH SWAP MEET GETS PERSONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LUSTIG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First came the personal computer. A short time later came the first personal 
computer swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
They're not really swap meets in the traditional sense. Nobody will trade a 
computer and a printer for two cows and a bale of hay, but people who attend 
them say that if you know what you're looking for, there are some real bargains 
to be found. 
</P>
<P>
"A person can probably save 10% here over a regular store," said John Carter, 
who was manning a booth at the monthly Devonshire Downs computer swap meet in 
Northridge. He said many dealers show up for "referrals and to spread the word 
about their products." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the giant barn-like swap meet building near Balboa Boulevard and 
Devonshire Street are row after long row of merchants -- averaging 120 per meet 
-- hawking everything from blank diskettes, games and computer boards to 
screens, peripherals and entire computer setups. 
</P>
<P>
According to Michael Marinelli, account executive for the Northridge show, 
2,500 to 3,000 people will buy a $5 admission ticket for the swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm toying with the idea of buying a modem," Marvin Walters of Agoura said as 
he browsed the long aisles. "The ability to work out of my home and send 
information to the office intrigues me, so I came to look around and see if 
there's anything here I can't live without." 
</P>
<P>
One of the booths Walters stopped at was AJ Computer Supplies, which had tables 
crammed with modems, mouses, extended memory cards and keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
AJ's Pat Robinson said: "People just want to see what's available and what's 
new in the market. There's definitely a little give and take here, and we have 
fun haggling a little bit over prices." 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who rents a booth here has to have a business license," Marinelli said. 
"We want to make sure if someone comes here to buy something, it turns out to 
be a safe investment." DAVID LUSTIG

CREDIT CARD DELINQUENCIES HIT 4-YEAR HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, Deborah Mann spent about $400 on Christmas gifts. This year, she'll 
spend less than half that. 
</P>
<P>
That's because a decade of overspending on her credit cards has left her so far 
in debt that she's having difficulty making her mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles secretary is by no means unique. After years of running up huge 
credit card debts in an unprecedented spending spree, American consumers are 
finally showing signs of over-extension. 
</P>
<P>
Bank credit card delinquencies have risen to a four-year high, according to 
figures released last week by the American Bankers Assn. Meanwhile, consumers 
are flooding debt-counseling offices in Los Angeles and around the country. 
</P>
<P>
With a recession around the corner, bankers and retailers are understandably 
worried. Never before have Americans been so in debt at the beginning of an 
economic downturn. No one knows exactly what will happen to consumers, their 
creditors and vendors as the expected recession worsens. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are a banker, this is the time to worry," said Sandra Shaber, vice 
president of The Futures Group in Washington. "Banks have seen all types of 
debts go bad. And now, what seemed to be a relatively safe haven -- consumer 
debt -- is softening too." 
</P>
<P>
Roughly 4% of the bank card balances outstanding were more than 30 days past 
due during the third quarter of 1990, according to the American Bankers Assn. 
That's the highest level for such delinquencies since 1986, when it went as 
high as 4.9%. 
</P>
<P>
How Americans got into this sorry state is a matter of debate. Some blame the 
government, which for years encouraged such borrowing with tax breaks. Some 
blame inflation, which made debt seem attractive because consumers knew they'd 
be paying it back with dollars that were worth comparatively less. Others blame 
the banks and credit card companies, which continued to send credit 
applications to people already living on the edge. 
</P>
<P>
Anecdotal evidence certainly indicates that consumers are troubled. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three months, literally hundreds of Los Angeles residents have 
flooded into credit-counseling offices complaining that they can no longer 
handle all their debts, said Pam Tobias, general manager of Consumer Credit 
Counseling Service, a nonprofit organization that helps overextended 
individuals set up debt repayment plans with their creditors. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen a 30% increase in appointments just since August," Tobias said. 
</P>
<P>
And that trend is mirrored nationwide, said Jay Muzychenko, vice president of 
the National Foundation for Consumer Credit. Muzychenko's organization 
counseled more than 300,000 consumers last year, and he expects that figure to 
jump between 30% and 40% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Problem cases, Tobias said, include a Los Angeles-area woman in her 20s who, 
between credit cards and student loans, had run up $20,000 in debt. And a local 
couple with two children and $30,000 a year in take-home pay were falling about 
$400 a month short on their mortgage, car and other debt payments because of 
$29,000 in credit card debts. 
</P>
<P>
People coming in for credit counseling, Tobias said, range from those with 
annual incomes well over $100,000 to people on food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Mann also is a credit counseling client. For the last several years, 
she had been using her credit cards to supplement her monthly income. If she 
could not afford it, she just charged it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a matter of keeping up with the Joneses. I knew I didn't have the 
money, but I wanted to leave an impression on my kids that we could have things 
and go places," she said. "But it got to the point where every month I was $250 
to $300 short." 
</P>
<P>
Mann borrowed so much that she was paying $600 a month -- nearly half her 
take-home pay -- just for the minimum payments on her credit cards. She became 
delinquent and is now on a payment plan with her creditors. Her credit card 
debts now total $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to stop spending. I was at a point where I couldn't even meet my 
mortgage payments," she said. "We are not going to have a big Christmas. But, 
hopefully, we are going to have a meaningful one." 
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that the high rate of credit card delinquencies accounted 
for by consumers like Mann is a troubling sign for more than just bankers. 
Credit card delinquency rates are a leading indicator of consumer financial 
health, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
There is a hierarchy of debt payments, said Jack Kyser, chief economist with 
the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. Consumers in financial trouble are 
likely to stop paying on their credit cards before they default on other types 
of debts, such as car and house payments. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, too, when consumers have had trouble making such payments, they 
start to scale back, said Gary Schlossberg, senior economist with Wells Fargo 
Bank in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the dramatic slowdown in spending that has troubled retailers 
this Christmas is likely to get worse, Schlossberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"Delinquencies on credit cards are particularly alarming because the minimum 
payments due on a credit card represent a tiny fraction of the total amount 
due," added Elgie Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders of America in Herndon, 
Va. "So, when people are delinquent in paying even the minimums, it is a sign 
of potentially serious future financial problems for individuals and for the 
economy as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
Although economists said that some increase in consumer delinquencies is 
expected in times of economic weakness, they are particularly worried now 
because consumer debt levels are high. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the United States was in a recession, consumer debt as a 
percentage of income was at 14.1%. Now, it is 18.4%. Bank card debt outstanding 
has quadrupled over the period, totaling $132 billion versus only $31 billion 
in 1982, Holstein said. 
</P>
<P>
But Schlossberg, who is studying consumer debt, said that there are some 
encouraging trends. He believes, for example, that the nation's most affluent 
consumers are also the most indebted, and they, after all, are best able to 
handle it. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, delinquency rates are sure to rise in coming months.

UC, CAL STATE CRITICIZED ON QUAKE PREPARATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: A STATE COMMISSION SAYS THE SCHOOLS ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO BRING 
BUILDINGS UP TO STANDARDS.

<P>
California's two public university systems have been sharply criticized by the 
California Seismic Safety Commission for failing to bring campus buildings up 
to earthquake safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State system has neither an adequate policy statement about the need 
for seismic safety nor a plan to bring it about on its 20 campuses, the 
commission said in a report made available Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
And the University of California system has a policy to retrofit existing 
buildings but is not implementing it quickly enough, the report said. Failure 
to do so immediately "will continue to expose both people and programs to a 
high degree of vulnerability for years, perhaps decades, to come," the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said the plan for the nine UC campuses was good in concept but 
that "there are serious problems in the areas of funding and accountability." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of both university systems agreed that many buildings still need to 
be made safer but complained that they lacked funds to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
The commission report acknowledged that both systems face a funding problem but 
urged them to shift their priorities so that more money is spent to shore up 
hazardous buildings, rather than on other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The report was a response to an executive order signed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian after the 1989 Bay Area earthquake, calling on all state agencies to 
make seismic safety a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
The governor ordered the commission, made up of 15 of his own appointees and 
two state legislators, to monitor progress and report to him periodically. This 
is the first report dealing with the two university systems. It does not list 
the buildings considered to be unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
The commission praised the UC system for an earthquake safety program that 
dates to the mid-1970s and also had kind words for UC President David P. 
Gardner's "personal commitment to seismic safety." 
</P>
<P>
But decisions by local campus officials have not always matched that 
commitment, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, new coaches' offices, a weight-training room and a "Hall of Fame," 
paid for with private gift funds, were added to Memorial Stadium on the 
Berkeley campus, even though no additional structural improvements were made 
and the 72,000-seat football stadium sits astride the dangerous Hayward Fault. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, improving intercollegiate athletic facilities was a higher 
priority than improving the seismic safety of this known collapse hazard," the 
report said. "Instead of reducing the risk by reducing occupancy, the campus 
actually chose to increase it." 
</P>
<P>
Nadesan Permaul, a UC Berkeley official, said the additions, all part of the 
"Cal Sports '80s Improvements" program, were approved by two engineering firms. 
</P>
<P>
Permaul said there was a "difference of opinion" between the structural 
specialists engaged by the Seismic Safety Commission and those hired by the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly respect their opinion, but we feel we've taken a prudent, 
cautious approach in making these improvements," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Smith, a UC assistant vice president for policy analysis and capital 
planning, said the system is just as eager as the commission to make campus 
buildings safe. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working on seismic safety for many years," Smith said. "The issue 
is lack of funds. The commission wants seismic safety to be the university's 
highest priority, but we have other state mandates to meet at the same time," 
such as increasing campus capacities to accommodate the top one-eighth of the 
state's high school graduates who are eligible for the system. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said UC has identified 149 buildings on its campuses as "poor" or "very 
poor" and has repaired, or has plans to repair, all but 49. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at that as pretty significant progress," she said. "We would do them 
all but the problem is, where does the money come from?" 
</P>
<P>
While the report deals at some length with UC, the section on Cal State is 
short because of the lack of a specific policy aimed at addressing the seismic 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Possible sources of money to pay for repairs have not been identified and Cal 
State has been unwilling to increase student fees to pay for structural repairs 
in such student-funded buildings as cafeterias and dormitories, the report 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Coffin, chief of architecture and engineering for the 360,000-student Cal 
State system, said a 10-year earthquake-repair plan has been prepared but 
conceded that "there has been no systematic effort" to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had the money to do it," Coffin said. "Unlike UC, we don't have any 
discretionary money we can move around for a purpose like this. All our money 
comes from the state." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
After the October, 1989, Loma Prieta earthquake, Gov. George Deukmejian issued 
an executive order directing state agencies, including the University of 
California and California State systems, to make seismic safety a priority for 
state structures. The governor ordered the California Seismic Safety 
Commission, a 17-member body including both engineers and representatives of 
local and state government, to monitor progress being made in improving 
earthquake safety in state structures.

GIS' SURVIVAL CHANCES RISE AS MEDICAL CARE IMPROVES; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: THE WOUNDED WOULD HAVE THE BEST ODDS OF ANY CONFLICT TO DATE, 
AMERICAN DOCTORS BELIEVE.

EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With nearly a million troops from 29 nations poised for combat in the Persian 
Gulf, allied military commanders have put in place the most advanced medical 
facilities ever known to handle casualties of war. 
</P>
<P>
The opposing forces -- Iraq alone on one side of the Kuwaiti border, 28 Arab 
and Western military forces on the other -- have at their disposal a fearsome 
conventional arsenal: missiles than can travel hundreds of miles, bombers with 
payloads of 30 tons, deadly gas, the newest tanks and ground-unit firepower 
ranging from assault rifles to long-range artillery. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. doctors here believe that if hostilities break out, the chances of 
American soldiers surviving battlefield wounds would be better than ever 
before. Every non-nuclear war, in fact, has become more survivable than the one 
before it because of medical progress and speedier evacuation of the wounded to 
rear-echelon hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we're looking at pretty much the same situation as Vietnam," said 
Navy Capt. Jerry Grim of Fallbrook, Calif., the senior doctor for the Marine 
Expeditionary Force in the gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
"The wounded are generally going to get back to good medical care within that 
first so-called golden hour. With the facilities we've got here now, I'd expect 
that the mortality rate would be lower than it's been in other wars." 
</P>
<P>
In the Vietnam War, more than 90% of American casualties survived. 
</P>
<P>
One new concept being tried in the gulf is the deployment of a mobile, 
land-based, Navy-run fleet hospital that is as sophisticated as a hospital 
ship. The self-contained tent hospital, including 500 beds in 14 wards, six 
operating tables and a staff of 80 doctors, is shipped in 406 containers and 
can be unpacked, set up and made operational in about two weeks. Four 
helicopter pads are located nearby. 
</P>
<P>
At Fleet Hospital 5 in Saudi Arabia's Eastern province, doctors say the initial 
volume of casualties could be high because of the amount of firepower massed on 
both sides of the Kuwaiti border. Excluding the possibility of chemical 
warfare, however, they do not expect a conflict in the gulf to produce 
unfamiliar medical problems. In previous combat situations, injuries to the 
extremities have accounted for 35% to 40% of the casualties, abdominal wounds 
20% to 25%, head wounds 15% and chest wounds 15% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing here what we did at home," said Lt. Cmdr. Keith Pumroy of 
Chesapeake, Va. "Most of us have worked at a trauma center in the states, and 
the type of patient we'd see in combat wouldn't be that different. The only 
difference would be in the volume of patients." 
</P>
<P>
Some doctors complain that spare parts for their sophisticated medical 
equipment have been slow to arrive, and others say certain medicines, such as 
diarrhea pills, were initially in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
But the supply lines seem to be working adequately now, and doctors are 
encouraged because communicable diseases -- which caused more deaths in World 
War II than bullets -- are minimal in the gulf. Also, Saudi Arabia is a clean, 
sanitary country, lessening the chances of post-operative infections. 
</P>
<P>
"Life was a bitch at first," said Lt. Cmdr. Mike Mozzetti of San Diego, an 
emergency medical physician at the fleet hospital. "But once we set up the 
hospital and got busy, things steadily improved, and I'd say morale is very 
good now." 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest concern (is) that a lot of us feel our skills declining. That's 
the major problem with the medical corps. You have to have patients to do 
things. It's not that you forget how to be a physician. It's just that your 
skills aren't as sharp when you aren't using them every day." 
</P>
<P>
Many wounds in Vietnam were caused by snipers, small-unit firefights and 
poisoned punji sticks hidden in the ground. With the exception of the Tet 
offensive, some sieges such as Khe Sahn and some battles such as Hamburger Hill 
and the Ia Drang Valley, fighting was not sustained, and flash points of 
massive casualties were few. But the potential conflict in the gulf presents 
military planners with new imponderables. 
</P>
<P>
Will helicopters be as useful for evacuation in the wide-open desert as they 
were in the jungle? Will there be more burn victims because of tank battles? 
Are the hospitals large enough to handle a sudden influx of casualties far 
greater than seen in a guerrilla war? 
</P>
<P>
How great is the threat of nerve gas, which Iraqi President Saddam Hussein used 
against Iranians and his own Kurdish minority? Is it true that Iraq has 
equipped Scud missiles with gas canisters? 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of chemical warfare has spooked U.S. soldiers, although senior 
commanders consider use of nerve or mustard gas more of "a nuisance," in one 
officer's words, than an effective tactic. American soldiers have trained 
extensively here with MOPP (mission-oriented protective posture) anti-gas 
equipment that includes masks, gloves, wrap-about uniforms and self-injected 
antidotes. During the Iran-Iraq War, fewer than 3% of gas victims died. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously taking the threat of Scud-fired gas seriously, though we don't 
know if Iraq really has that capability or not," said Cmdr. Thad Zajdowicz, an 
internal medicine specialist. "Yes, people will die if chemical weapons are 
employed, but it's not going to be like a line of insects falling over when 
they're sprayed with Raid. Most of the fighting men probably would be 
unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
"Chemical weapons for the most part are employed at the forward edge of the 
battle area because of the limited range of the artillery that fires them. In 
this environment, nerve-gas agents would dissipate within minutes because of 
the sun and constant wind. The blistering agents of mustard gas would persist 
much longer. Things that they hit could remain contaminated for days or weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Decontamination of people and equipment involves washing down with 
high-pressure sprays -- and it ideally is handled in the field, before a victim 
reaches a rear-echelon facility. A gas attack that incapacitates large numbers 
of soldiers could severely disrupt the military's ability to handle the flow of 
casualties. The new U.S. M1-A1 Abrams tanks now arriving from Germany, which 
are designed to be resistant to chemical warfare, are particularly well suited 
to the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy of handling casualties remains largely unchanged since the Vietnam 
War. A wounded soldier is treated first by corpsmen assigned to all infantry 
platoons. If hurt seriously enough, the victim then works his way back toward 
the rear, to the small, forward-based MASH (mobile Army surgical hospital) 
units at battalion level, and finally to a fleet or ship hospital, which has 
the capability to perform any operation short of open heart or brain surgery. 
The most serious cases would be flown to hospitals in Europe or the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was an intern and resident, my professors would scream and holler at 
you, and you knew there was no room for second best," said Maj. David Remedios, 
who studied under heart surgeon Michael E. DeBakey in Houston. "Here (in a MASH 
unit), you do the best you can." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say it is impossible to estimate precisely how many casualties they 
could handle in the Persian Gulf theater in an hour or a day. But it is certain 
that if thousands of Americans were struck down in a short period, the medical 
system would become overloaded and evacuation to rear facilities would be 
greatly slowed. In such an event, the death rate would almost certainly be 
substantial. 
</P>
<P>
The massive medical buildup in the gulf underscores how serious the threat of 
war is and how destructive it could be. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to numerous forward facilities, the United States has on station 
Fleet Hospital 5, and plans to deploy two more fleet hospitals are under 
consideration. Two floating hospitals, the Mercy and the Comfort, have been 
deployed off the coast. The converted oil tankers each have 1,000 beds, 12 
operating theaters and staffs of 900. Only eight hospitals in the world are 
larger than the Mercy or Comfort, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force is capable of flying 1,000 patients a day to medical facilities 
in Frankfurt, Landstuhl and Wiesbaden, Germany; three British bases in Britain 
and Incirlik in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of World War II, the military operated hospitals with half a million 
beds. The Defense Department's bed capacity now is 17,500, expandable to 50,000 
in a short time. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Congress said that in times of crisis, military and Veterans 
Administration hospitals should be prepared to handle casualties. VA Secretary 
Edward J. Derwinski said recently that his 172 hospitals -- 22 of which are 
designated to receive chemical war casualties -- could provide 12,610 beds 
within 24 hours and 25,000 beds within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six Americans have died of various causes in Saudi Arabia since the U.S. 
deployment began in early August. About 2,300 others have been evacuated to 
hospitals in Europe and the United States with injuries, most of them 
orthopedic.

CAVAZOS QUITS EDUCATION POST AMID CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lauro F. Cavazos, the first Latino member of the President's Cabinet, resigned 
Wednesday as secretary of education one day after a closed-door meeting with 
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and amid criticism that his 
department had not measured up. 
</P>
<P>
The department's "performance was short of where we wanted it to be," one 
senior White House official said, adding that it was unclear whether Cavazos 
"had been pushed" to resign during his Tuesday meeting with Sununu. 
</P>
<P>
Leading candidates to replace him were two defeated Republican Senate 
candidates, Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois and Rep. Tom Tauke of Iowa, although 
several others were under consideration, including Deputy Education Secretary 
Ted Sanders, Administration officials and others said. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos, appointed by President Ronald Reagan and reappointed by President 
Bush, is leaving his post Friday, and Sanders will serve as acting head. The 
resignation was announced at a Cabinet meeting, which Cavazos did not attend. 
He is not expected to return for the personal departure appearance with Bush 
that the President has made with other top officials leaving the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter accepting the resignation, Bush told Cavazos that the secretary's 
work "has set us on a path to educational excellence through the end of the 
decade." 
</P>
<P>
But Cavazos' tenure received mixed reviews from other members of the 
Administration and education experts, reflecting criticism that had dogged him 
throughout most of his 2 1/2 years as the nation's senior educator. 
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old Cavazos, whose first formal education was in a one-room 
schoolhouse and who eventually became president of Texas Tech University, did 
not say in his resignation letter to Bush what he would do. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos during his tenure was best known for promoting the idea of allowing 
parents to choose where to send their children to school. He also advocated 
bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Bush, Cavazos said he was proud of the contributions he made 
in "expanding choice in education, promoting the executive order on excellence 
in education for Hispanic Americans, and raising awareness of the growing 
diversity of America's student population." 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos' leadership of the department caused little controversy, but he drew 
low marks as a leader in the education field. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't do much. In fact, he didn't do anything," said Albert Shanker, 
president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the two major 
organizations representing teachers. The other is the National Education Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But that harsh view was countered by Robert H. Atwell, president of the 
American Council on Education, who praised him as "a distinguished scholar and 
an experienced academic administrator" whose commitment to education was 
greater than that of the White House he served. 
</P>
<P>
As secretary of education under a chief executive who pledged during the 1988 
presidential campaign to be the "education President," Cavazos found himself in 
a particularly difficult position. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's focus on education issues during the campaign -- or at least his 
frequent mention of education as a focus of his concern -- guaranteed that his 
Department of Education would come under scrutiny and that its performance 
would be weighed against the promises of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating Cavazos' performance was the federal budget crunch and the fact 
that he followed a dynamic education secretary, William J. Bennett, who never 
shied from public endorsement of controversial positions. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government's role in financing education is relatively small, 
contrasted with that of states and individual communities. Its policy role is 
similarly limited. Thus, if the department "is to make a difference, it has to 
have a secretary playing a leadership role, and that wasn't Cavazos' strength," 
said one education expert who has worked closely with Cavazos and did not want 
to be quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is, he may have gotten a little tired of the pounding he took. He did 
take a pounding," said the former White House official, who has remained close 
to Bush. "He suffered because he followed a guy who was a very forceful 
personality. He was much more reserved." 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed to always be the whipping boy of the Cabinet, getting the lowest 
marks and taking criticism as being the least effective, which wasn't fair," 
the former Bush aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos' resignation leaves Bush with two Cabinet posts to fill. Labor 
Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole announced her resignation Oct. 24 to become 
president of the American Red Cross. Other shifts are rumored as Bush 
approaches the midpoint of his term, one senior White House official reported. 
</P>
<P>
By early next year, the official said, Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter 
will "probably have had enough." And, he said, "people are bailing out at" the 
Commerce Department "as if something is happening." However, there have been no 
substantial indications that Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, a Texan 
and a longtime friend of the President, is about to leave his post. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation leaves one other Latino -- Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. 
-- in the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I hear, Lujan wants to stay and the President is happy with the job 
he is doing," one former White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was said to be interested in the education post -- she had also been 
mentioned as a possible candidate for the job of labor secretary. She and 
Tauke, who has been a member of the House Education and Labor Committee, are 
both longtime supporters of Bush and are looking for jobs after giving up their 
House seats to run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Others mentioned as possible successors include Lynne Cheney, chairwoman of the 
National Endowment for the Humanities and wife of Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney; former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean and Rep. Patricia Saiki (R-Hawaii), 
who ran unsuccessfully for the Senate.

DIVERSE USES FOR NORTON AIR BASE PLANNED WHEN IT CLOSES 
</P>

Norton Air Force Base, the biggest employer in San Bernardino, might be 
developed into a high-tech center with an amusement park and satellite campus 
of UC Riverside when the military closes the post in 1994, an agency made up of 
local officials decided Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Closure of the base will eliminate more than 10,000 jobs -- 5,264 of which are 
filled by local civilians. But the developer selected Wednesday to guide the 
base's transformation said as many as 10,000 new jobs could be created. 
</P>
<P>
Many details remain to be worked out, but the Inland Valley Development Agency, 
which includes representatives from San Bernardino County and the cities of 
Colton, Loma Linda and San Bernardino, gave tentative endorsement to a plan for 
the 2,003-acre base submitted by Norton International Partners. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership, headed by Los Angeles developer Iddo Benzeevi, said its plans 
for the base include a high-tech research facility, as well as a sports center. 
The amusement park would be designed by George Lucas of "Star Wars" fame, the 
developer said. 
</P>
<P>
Benzeevi proposed a similar plan for the city of Moreno Valley several years 
ago, but it was nixed because of opposition from nearby March Air Force Base. 
His partner in the Norton venture is developer Ray Watt, chairman of Santa 
Monica-based Watt Industries. The pair has been assisted by Bechtel 
Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The local agency -- which was created by state law -- voted Wednesday only to 
negotiate exclusively with the Benzeevi partnership on a redevelopment plan for 
the base, which is located east of downtown San Bernardino. A formal contract 
will be voted on next week, with most details of the huge project to be decided 
later, said chairman Robert L. Hammock, a member of the San Bernardino County 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the agency received a dozen proposals from would-be developers of 
the base. A consultant narrowed the field to four finalists, then on Monday a 
panel of 11 citizens recommended the Benzeevi partnership. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the lost jobs, Norton's closure will force about 1,900 
reservists with the 445th Military Airlift Wing to move to March Air Force Base 
in Riverside. The rest of the wing's 3,300 members will transfer to McChord Air 
Force Base in Tacoma or leave the reserves. The wing's flight crews have flown 
more than 100 volunteer missions for Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
Norton is one of two San Bernardino County air bases due to close in the 1990s. 
No decision has been made on the future use of the second, George Air Force 
Base near Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Adelanto and a joint powers agency representing other cities both 
have designs on the desert land at George.

Authorities searched a remote desert hut here Wednesday but found no sign of 
Neill F. Matzen, who police believe wrote a suicide letter confessing to the 
Nov. 24 bludgeoning murder of a Buena Park nurse for a promised $15,000 payment 
from the woman's husband. 
</P>
<P>
Matzen, a 36-year-old tow truck driver from Santa Ana, told his wife, Cynthia 
R. Matzen, in one of the letters that he would kill himself at a rock hut about 
four miles south of Interstate 10 where the couple spent last New Year's Eve, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A search team made up of two Buena Park investigators, two Bureau of Land 
Management rangers and a Riverside County sheriff's investigator located the 
primitive hut but found no traces of Matzen or any other recent visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"Now he could be anywhere," said Riverside County Sheriff's Investigator John 
B. Jameson. "This is a truck stop. He looks like a trucker . . . and he could 
have caught a ride to Texas or Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
Nine days after Donna J. Connaty was murdered with a metal pipe, Matzen killed 
her husband and his friend, alleged co-conspirator Richard P. Connaty, in a 
shoot-out at a Santa Ana trailer park that began when Connaty yelled at Matzen, 
"You killed my wife!" and opened fire, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators declined to file charges against Matzen in that killing, saying 
that Matzen shot Connaty in self-defense. But they arrested him later that day 
on suspicion of murdering Donna Connaty, only to free him two days later 
because of insufficient evidence to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after leaving the jail ward at Western Medical Center in Anaheim, 
where he was recovering from a wound in his left arm suffered in the gunfight 
with Connaty, Matzen wrote letters to police and his wife saying he would soon 
be dead, and a five-page letter to the Orange County Register detailing the 
violent events of the previous two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"These are facts known only to me and a dead man, and by the time you get this 
letter I will also be dead, out in Chiriaco Summit, 30 miles east of Indio," 
began the letter, which was received by the newspaper Tuesday and turned over 
to Buena Park police. 
</P>
<P>
The letter tells of an affair between Richard Connaty -- who was in the midst 
of divorce proceedings with his wife -- and Cynthia Matzen, and of Connaty's 
wish to have his wife killed. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me that he was going to refinance his house to do remodeling and, if 
his problem was solved before December, he would pay me $15,000," Matzen wrote 
in the letter. He went on to explain how Connaty told him when his wife would 
be alone in the house and left a metal pipe and a change of clothes for him. 
</P>
<P>
Matzen said that on Dec. 2, about two weeks after the murder, he told Connaty 
that he would not permit him to continue the affair with his wife, which led to 
the gunfight the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that he wasn't gonna have my wife either and that is why he tried 
to kill me," Matzen wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Matzen's car was found Tuesday in the parking lot of the Gen. Patton Memorial 
Museum in Chiriaco Summit, where residents reported seeing him over the weekend 
in a coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not suicidal, believe me," said Kay Allen, a waitress at the Chiriaco 
Summit Coffee Shop. Allen said Matzen told her that he had killed his best 
friend in a gunfight in Phoenix, and had no money because police kept his money 
as evidence. The curator of the museum down the road paid for his meals, Allen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another waitress, Michelle Staci, said she first saw Matzen eating breakfast 
Monday about 6 a.m. He returned about noon to buy sodas, she said, and that was 
the last she saw of him. 
</P>
<P>
While investigators Wednesday found no recent trace of Matzen, they did find a 
note in a visitors log in the rock hut left by Neill and Cynthia Matzen last 
Dec. 31: "We are here to say goodbye to the old year and hello to the new."

PANEL ATTACKS STATE PENSION OFFICIALS FOR STOCK LOSSES; 
</P>
<P>
ASSEMBLY: THE $56-BILLION RETIREMENT SYSTEM PUT $400 MILLION IN REAL ESTATE 
HOLDINGS. THIS MONTH THE SHARES LOST 75% OF THEIR VALUE.

<P>
Officials who run the state's mammoth pension system were strongly criticized 
Wednesday for a decision to privately purchase $400 million in real estate 
stock that later plummeted 75% in value as soon as the shares were traded 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
The $56-billion retirement system purchased 10.5 million shares in Catellus 
Development Corp., a real estate spinoff of the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad, in 
November, 1989. At the time, the state agreed to pay $37.79 a share. But this 
month, when the stock was publicly traded for the first time, it sold initially 
for about $11 a share and then dropped to $9.25 a share -- a paper loss of 
about $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman David Elder (D-San Pedro), who chairs a legislative committee that 
oversees the state pension plans, said that before funds from the California 
Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) were invested in such a venture, 
officials should have taken some step to protect their investment from so 
sudden a drop in value. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did PERS pay roughly four times the current market rate for its stock? Or 
put another way, where did the $300 million go?" Elder asked at a hearing 
called to explore the investment. 
</P>
<P>
Those connected with the purchase defended their actions, saying they had every 
reason to believe the investment was a good long-term risk. Officials also 
maintained that the loss connected with its drop in value would not have any 
immediate impact on employees' retirements. 
</P>
<P>
William Ramseyer, executive vice president of JMB Institutional Realty Corp., 
the investment's underwriter, said the sellers would not have agreed to the 
kind of protections Elder was suggesting. JMB collected a fee of nearly $8 
million for arranging the stock purchase and earns $2.4 million a year from the 
retirement fund for managing the investment. Elder called that an 
"unprecedented deal." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, officials were called before the Assembly Committee on Public 
Employees, Retirement and Social Security to defend the investment which gave 
the state a 20% interest in the railroad's real estate arm. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a series of sporadic legislative inquiries into 
investments made by one of the world's largest pension funds. PERS represents 
more than 600,000 state and local public employees and 270,000 retirees. 
</P>
<P>
While financially sound and generally considered to have earned a good return 
on its total investments, the pension system has been criticized in the past 
for individual investment decisions, including a $25-million unsecured loan to 
now-bankrupt Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., an investment company that 
specialized in the sale of junk bonds. The system also held more than $500 
million in so-called high-yield bonds that suffered $87 million in paper losses 
with the collapse of the junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the pension system was roundly criticized in a report by the same 
Assembly committee for taking unnecessary risks in the stock market. Together, 
the State Teachers Retirement System and PERS had 40% of their money in the 
stock market at the time of the 1987 stock market crash and lost a combined 
total of $7.6 billion. Those losses were later recouped and the fund managers 
have since trimmed their stock portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
Elder said he was concerned that the system had made many investment decisions 
during a robust economy and had not considered how these investments would 
weather an economic downturn. 
</P>
<P>
Stephan Roulac, managing partner of Roulac Consulting Group, a firm hired by 
PERS as its real estate adviser, said he had recommended the purchase because 
he considered it a "singular opportunity" and an investment that would be 
"advantageous to the system." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe real estate and land holdings -- consisting of 2 million acres of 
property mostly in California -- had the potential to produce a highly 
favorable long-term return, Roulac said. The property, he said, was acquired by 
the railroad over many decades and included some parcels in downtown Los 
Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco and others in rural and desert areas that 
were undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
Roulac acknowledged that he had anticipated the value of the stock might drop 
as much as 30% when it was publicly traded, but he conceded he had not expected 
it to dive nearly 75%. Even so, he told the committee, he considered it a good 
investment decision. He said the railroad had the capital to "defer 
development" and wait out any downturn in the real estate market.

MARINE WHO REFUSED TO GO TO MIDEAST IS RELEASED; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: THE CORPORAL, WHO SOUGHT TO BE CLASSED AS A CONSCIENTIOUS 
OBJECTOR, IS GIVEN AN 'OTHER THAN HONORABLE' DISCHARGE AND A REDUCTION IN RANK.

The first Marine to refuse deployment under Operation Desert Shield was 
released from active duty Wednesday at Camp Pendleton after being granted an 
"other than honorable" administrative discharge, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Cpl. Jeffrey A. Paterson, a Hawaii-based Marine who was being processed 
for release at Camp Pendleton, was given any back pay he was owed and an 
airplane ticket home to San Francisco, according to Staff Sgt. Vicki Turney, a 
Camp Pendleton spokeswoman. About 2:30 p.m., she said, he boarded a public bus 
and left the base. 
</P>
<P>
"His record is closed," Turney said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Marine Corps agreed to discharge Paterson and drop court-martial 
proceedings against him. In return, the 22-year-old artillery controller halted 
legal action against the Marine Corps stemming from its rejection of his 
request for conscientious objector -- or CO -- status. He also admitted to two 
infractions and accepted a reduction of rank, from corporal to lance corporal. 
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen. R.L. Phillips, Paterson's commanding officer, said in a statement 
that the expeditious discharge was "in the best interests of the United States 
government." But Eric Seitz, Paterson's attorney, said Wednesday that his 
client benefited from the military's eagerness to avoid further negative 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"The Marine Corps decided they just had to end it," Seitz said, adding that 
Paterson was pleased with the settlement. "We equate an other-than-honorable 
discharge as essentially being fired. And we're comfortable with that. He 
didn't want to be in the military any more than they wanted him to be in the 
military." 
</P>
<P>
Paterson's case had drawn international attention since Aug. 29, when he 
refused a direct order to board a military transport plane bound for Saudi 
Arabia, sitting down on the floor of the hangar as his fellow Marines left. 
Twelve days earlier, he had filed an application for conscientious objector 
status, saying that to engage in combat would be to betray his beliefs. "Many 
assert that because I signed a contract and placed myself in the indentured 
servitude of the military four years ago, I should fulfill my 'obligation,' 
regardless of my belief," Paterson wrote in an opinion piece published by The 
Times in October. "I've been chipping away at my soul for two years now, 
fulfilling that contract. . . . I can bend no farther." 
</P>
<P>
He continued: "That is not to say that I will not fight for the people of this 
land, or any other land. But my weapons are ideas, commitment and a sense of 
justice -- not bullets, chemical rockets or nuclear warheads. And my battles 
are against injustice, inequality and the placing of the Earth's wealth in the 
hands of the very few." 
</P>
<P>
William Paterson, Jeffrey's father, said Wednesday that the family has a big 
celebration planned when Jeff arrives home in Hollister, a small community 
southeast of San Jose. But, the elder Paterson said: "It's not really over. He 
still wants to go on speaking out. It just goes into another phase. At least 
now he's a little freer to do what he wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
Paterson, who held a news conference in August to announce his conscientious 
objector claim, has continued to criticize the U.S. military presence in the 
Persian Gulf, which he says risks lives on behalf of "imperialistic economic 
interests." According to Seitz, military officials sought to discredit 
Paterson's application by saying it was based on his political beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Military regulations require that to be granted conscientious objector status 
on religious, moral or ethical grounds, a member of the service must prove that 
the belief is the primary controlling force in his or her life -- a belief "of 
the same strength and depth as found in traditional religious conviction." 
Seitz says his client met that criteria. 
</P>
<P>
Seitz also disputed the Marine Corps' statement that Paterson will 
automatically lose his veterans' benefits as a result of his discharge, saying 
that was "not an automatically foregone conclusion." Administrative discharges 
can be upgraded, he said, and are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to 
determine what benefits are granted. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Marine Corps receives an average of 32 conscientious objector 
applications in any given year, according to Maj. Nancy LaLuntas, a spokeswoman 
at Headquarters Marine Corps in Arlington, Va. To date this year, she said, 33 
applications have been received -- although more may be en route to 
headquarters. Of the 33, eight were received since the beginning of August, 
when Operation Desert Shield started. One is pending, 19 have been approved and 
13 denied.

FREEWAY OVERFLOW REVIVES OLD ROAD'S BLOODY REPUTATION 
</P>

<P>
When the Antelope Valley Freeway opened in 1963, it drained traffic from the 
nearby Sierra Highway, turning a once busy and dangerous thoroughfare into a 
sleepy country road. 
</P>
<P>
But today, with thousands of commuters clogging the freeway each morning and 
evening, hundreds of motorists are returning to Sierra Highway, restoring its 
reputation as a route so hazardous that a section of it that was once three 
lanes was described by a retired California Highway Patrol officer as "one up, 
one down, one suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Allen, an Agua Dulce resident whose car was destroyed in a collision on 
Sierra Highway Nov. 13, has resolved to do something. On Tuesday night, Allen 
presented petitions signed by nearly 500 people who urged the Santa Clarita 
City Council to install left-hand turn lanes to prevent accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always squealing brakes," said Kathy Duer, a cashier at Larry Bob's 
Mini Mart in Santa Clarita. "The freeway's so congested they're skipping over 
and using this street." 
</P>
<P>
"In the morning it's terrible," said Jerry Fox, manager of Fox Hay &amp; Grain. 
"Everybody drives so fast. I've seen lots of my customers rear-ended going in 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The signatures were collected at Fox Hay &amp; Grain and Larry Bob's, where 
customers often talk about their close calls on the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council ordered city traffic engineers to investigate the complaints 
but said the California Department of Transportation may have to oversee any 
improvements because the road is a state highway. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Highway roughly parallels the Antelope Valley Freeway from Santa Clarita 
to Acton. For much of its length, the road passes through rural country. When 
drivers reach a collection of businesses on Santa Clarita's eastern border, 
they are often unprepared to slow down, CHP Sgt. Mark Lunn said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a really tough area," Lunn said Wednesday. It's not unusual to stop 
drivers racing along the two-lane road at 90 m.p.h. "We start to see extremely 
high speeds about 4 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Statistics were not available Wednesday, but Lunn said officers log a high 
number of speeding violations along the route. The accident rate has not been 
as high, although serious accidents do occur, he said.

SEARCH FOR OFFICER CONTINUES AFTER POSSIBLE SIGHTING

A Los Angeles police officer, the subject of a massive search in eastern 
Ventura County, may have been seen jogging on a dirt road by a rancher near an 
abandoned airstrip in a remote area north of Simi Valley, a police spokesman 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
An 80-member search party -- including many police officers working off duty -- 
combed the hills north of Moorpark on Wednesday for Sgt. Christopher Vasquez, 
41, a 20-year veteran of the force who disappeared Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The search for Vasquez was being headed by Ventura County sheriff's deputies 
and centered on the hilly, undeveloped area behind the Moorpark townhouse he 
moved into recently. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said foul play was not suspected in the disappearance because 
Vasquez normally worked inside the station and had no involvement with 
sensitive investigations and little contact with the public. 
</P>
<P>
The searchers were working under the theory that Vasquez, an avid runner who 
often used the trails behind the townhouse, may have been hurt or lost. But 
they also acknowledged that Vasquez may have been depressed and suicidal 
because he had separated from his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a possibility," said Los Angeles Police Capt. Dan Watson, one of the 
missing man's supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said late Wednesday that authorities had interviewed a rancher who saw 
someone "who we believe is very possibly our officer." 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified rancher told authorities that he made the sighting between 2 
and 3 p.m. Monday on a dirt road near an abandoned airstrip in Alamos Canyon, 
just north of Simi Valley and about 4 miles north of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon is outside the 25-square-mile area covered by searchers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The person who sighted him was driving a truck," Watson said. "He was driving 
directly into the sun and nearly hit the person jogging." 
</P>
<P>
Watson said the jogger was wearing lime green running shorts and a white tank 
top. 
</P>
<P>
"They waved at each other and went on their way," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Earl Matthews said a search team of about 15 
people would sweep the Alamos Canyon area during the night. He said between 40 
and 50 Ventura County sheriffs personnel and Los Angeles police officers would 
pick up the search beginning at 7 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez is an assistant watch commander on the evening shift at the North 
Hollywood station. About midnight Sunday, he finished his shift, stowed his 
service revolver in a locker and went home to his rented townhouse on Marquette 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
He was due back at work at 3:30 p.m. Monday. When he didn't show up for work 
and didn't call in, his supervisors called his home and then sent officers to 
check on him when they received no answer. 
</P>
<P>
"This is highly unusual," Watson said. "Chris is very reliable. Not showing up 
for work is totally out of character." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews said officers found Vasquez's wallet and keys inside the townhouse. 
His late-model Porsche was parked in the garage, and his Acura Integra was 
parked by the curb next to the townhouse. Another handgun was found inside the 
townhouse, but authorities did not know if it belonged to him. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies and police officers quickly centered their search on the rugged 
area behind the townhouse and the track at nearby Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
"He's known to jog daily and frequently up in these hills," Matthews said. 
"We're working on the premise that he went for a jog and is possibly injured." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews said the search operation began Tuesday and that Ventura sheriff's 
search and rescue personnel and Los Angeles police officers had covered a 
25-square-mile area.

Shifting ground has cracked foundations and walls of at least a dozen houses in

Residents of the 142-unit Santa Fe tract in west Palmdale on Wednesday accused 
Calabasas-based Griffin Homes of failing to disclose the soil problem to some 
buyers or to offer fair prices for the deteriorating dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
But Griffin Vice President Marion Kiesling said the company, one of the largest 
builders in Southern California, has bought back six houses in the past year, 
and is in discussions to buy back another 12, even though not required by law 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is caused by a layer of clay underlying some houses, which expands 
when wet, a problem the builder says was overlooked by its pre-construction 
soil consultant. A new soil consultant said about 15 houses are affected and 
the builder agrees there are problems with 18. Residents say they are unsure 
how many houses are involved. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say the problems have cast a pall over their neighborhood as cracks 
in the houses have worsened, negotiations with Griffin have dragged on, and 
experts have warned there is no permanent fix for the houses, short of 
rebuilding them from the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
Even owners of houses found free of cracks are worried that their neighbors' 
problems will drag their own housing values down, and some are demanding that 
Griffin buy them out as well. But the company says it will only buy back 
residences with physical damage, and will not compensate those owners for 
improvements they have made, such as pools and patios. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to have to stay here for years and years while this is being 
negotiated. I've told them it's extremely upsetting," said Kari Gibson, who 
began finding cracks in what was supposed to be her family's "dream home" 
shortly after moving in about 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin said its original grading consultant failed to recognize the 
troublesome clay. 
</P>
<P>
The damaged houses are at the southern end of the tract, just southwest of 
Palmdale Boulevard and the Antelope Valley Freeway. Some back yard patios have 
been split by two-inch cracks. House foundations are cracking, fracturing walls 
and joints. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin began sales at the tract in early 1986 and continued through 1987. 
Residents began complaining of cracked walls almost immediately, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The company initially installed gutters to carry rainfall away from the houses 
and new drainage systems around some houses, but they only slowed the damage, 
Kiesling said. 
</P>
<P>
Kiesling said Griffin learned the full extent of the problem only this year 
after hiring a new consultant, Geolabs-Westlake Village, to conduct tests at 40 
residences. But residents said some buyers in 1988 were given documents by the 
escrow company that asked them to confirm they knew there was a soil problem at 
the site. One resident said she signed and went ahead, expecting the problem 
would not be serious. 
</P>
<P>
Given advice by Geolabs that the houses atop the clay layer might never be 
trouble-free, Kiesling said she doesn't know what ultimately will become of 
them. Some might be rented, but none would be resold unless permanently fixed, 
she said, calling it probably Griffin's worst-ever problem with a tract. 
</P>
<P>
Worried residents, meanwhile, are preparing for the rainy season. No lawsuits 
have been filed yet over the project, but some residents say that might be the 
outcome. "It's not our fault our house is starting to crack up 2 1/2 years 
after we bought it," resident Harry Lowe said.

$70-MILLION CITYWALK PLAN WINS COUNCIL OK; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: NEARBY RESIDENTS COMPLAIN MCA'S 257,000-SQUARE-FOOT MALL WILL 
ADD NOISE TO AN ALREADY BURDENED NEIGHBORHOOD AND BLOCK THEIR VIEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Over some objections from neighbors, MCA, as expected, won Los Angeles City 
Council approval Wednesday to build a $70-million addition to be known as 
"CityWalk" at its Universal City entertainment complex. 
</P>
<P>
CityWalk plans call for construction of a 257,000-square-foot 
pedestrian-oriented mall, consisting mostly of boutiques and restaurants but 
also including a 50,000-square-foot music production studio and a 
20,000-square-foot UCLA Extension facility. 
</P>
<P>
In voting for the project, Councilman Joel Wachs praised the media giant as 
"being about as responsive a neighbor as you can find." 
</P>
<P>
But Miriam Palacio, whose Blair Drive residence is next door to the Universal 
City property, contends living next to Universal City is like having a bully 
for a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
The Toluca Lake travel agent and her neighbors have opposed the CityWalk 
project, complaining that it would add an unacceptable amount of noise to their 
already burdened neighborhood and mar their views. 
</P>
<P>
Palacio contends MCA, a media conglomerate that is being purchased by a 
Japanese firm for $6.5 billion, filed a $50,000 lawsuit to harass her because 
of her vocal opposition to the project. "It's harassment, a nuisance lawsuit 
designed to intimidate me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed by MCA Development Co., the MCA subsidiary building the 
project, is over a portion of a sidewalk that encroaches onto the company's 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Palacio said the sidewalk, which she refused to remove, is a single square 
foot, but MCA officials say it is more like 13 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Former City Atty. Burt Pines, now an attorney-lobbyist for MCA, denies 
Palacio's allegations of harassment and adds that the foes of the CityWalk 
project are merely a "small group of dissidents." 
</P>
<P>
The CityWalk project is to be the first major addition to the popular 
entertainment attraction -- which now draws about 9 million visitors per year 
-- since nearly a dozen movie theaters were opened there about three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Before the council on Wednesday was an MCA request for a zoning variance for a 
small part of the project that is in the city. The remainder of the project is 
in unincorporated areas governed by county zoning and building codes. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously approved the variance at the urging of council 
President John Ferraro, who represents the area. The council also removed a 
series of restrictions on the use of a parking lot and driveway that MCA is 
proposing to build at the southeastern end of its huge property. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions, imposed by the city's Board of Zoning Appeals, placed limits 
on when the parking lot and driveway could be used. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners have contended that the 500- to 600-space parking lot and driveway 
will bring additional noise into their neighborhood and mar their view from 
Blair Drive, which overlooks the planned parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners are suing MCA, the city and the county of Los Angeles to require 
a full environmental impact report for the CityWalk project. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the homeowners have not had any luck in court in halting the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no merit to their claims -- the city says it, the county says it and 
the courts say it," said Lawrence D. Spungin, president of MCA Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the lawsuit against Palacio, Spungin also said MCA was only trying to 
protect its property rights "like any homeowner would."

PADRES GET COOLBAUGH FOR PARENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Padres, who still have hopes of acquiring third baseman Craig Worthington 
of the Baltimore Orioles, on Wednesday received third baseman Scott Coolbaugh 
from the Texas Rangers in a trade for catcher Mark Parent. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not calling off the dogs on getting another third baseman," said Joe 
McIlvaine, Padre general manager, "but nothing's really happening on that front 
right now. We now at least have a candidate for the job. He's really the only 
bona fide third baseman we've got." 
</P>
<P>
Coolbaugh, 24, has only one year, 127 days of major-league service, but unless 
the Padres make a trade for a veteran third baseman, he fills the void as the 
Padres' starter. He batted .200 with two homers and 13 RBIs in 67 games at 
Texas in 1990, hitting .315 against left-handers and only .151 against 
right-handed pitching. He currently is batting .238 with no homers for Mayagyez 
of the Puerto Rican League. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers once hoped Coolbaugh would be their third baseman of the future, 
but with a disappointing 1990 that included three trips to the minors and with 
the play of minor league third baseman Dean Palmer, they decided that Coolbaugh 
was expendable. 
</P>
<P>
"Scott's a better player than he showed last year," said Tom Grieve, Ranger 
general manager, "but he was was really not going to have a chance to play 
here. We owed it to him to give him a chance somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Coolbaugh's shot at becoming the Rangers' everyday third baseman came April 21 
when starter Steve Buechele sustained a broken right wrist. But when given the 
starting job, Coolbaugh batted only .164 with two RBIs in 28 games. He was sent 
to the minors May 25 for the second of three stints, and in his final two 
stints with the Rangers, batted .221 with two homers and 11 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was a wasted year," Coolbaugh said. "I just put a lot of pressure on 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Coolbaugh's name surfaced in trade rumors two years ago when the Padres were 
looking for third-base prospects and the Rangers were searching for catchers. 
The two clubs' needs never changed, and with the Rangers looking for a catcher 
who can platoon with Geno Petralli, the trade appears to be a perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
"There are big trades, and there are trades like this," McIlvaine said, "but it 
makes sense for both of us. Mark came to us at the end of last season and 
wanted to be traded, we asked around, and this is the best we could do." 
</P>
<P>
If Coolbaugh does not emerge into a starter, the Padres still have a 
contingency plan. They believe that third baseman Tom Redington, acquired last 
month from the Atlanta Braves, might be ready for the big leagues in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We have high hopes for Tom," McIlvaine said, "but we can't count on him for 
this season." 
</P>
<P>
Parent sought a trade simply to increase his playing time. He was frustrated 
sitting behind All-Star catcher Benito Santiago, and with the acquisition of 
Tom Lampkin at the All-Star break, Parent was not willing to be the third 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really excited, although I'm surprised it was Texas," Parent said. "It's a 
nice feeling to be wanted, although on the other hand, you can say it's like 
San Diego didn't want me any more. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh well, it was nice to be traded for a kid. I was afraid I was going to be 
traded for a dozen baseballs." 
</P>
<P>
Parent, 29, who had been with the Padre organization since being drafted in 
1979, batted .222 last season with three homers and 16 RBIs. His departure 
leaves right fielder Tony Gywnn, drafted in 1981, with the longest service time 
of any current Padre. 
</P>
<P>
Meanhile, Parent's best friend, free-agent first baseman Jack Clark, still is 
having contract discussions with the Boston Red Sox. Lou Gorman, Red Sox 
general manager, had a 40-minute conversation Wednesday with Tom Reich, Clark's 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
"We had good conversation," Gorman said, "but we're still hung up on a few 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, according to sources, is seeking a three-year contract for about $8.5 
million. The Red Sox are offering two years and an option. Clark also is 
opposed to being a full-time designated hitter, and would rather play first 
base. The Red Sox, however, still have Carlos Quintana at first, with 
minor-leaguer Mo Vaughn considered their first baseman of the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto Blue Jays also have shown interest in Clark, but they have not made 
an offer.

DAVE DISTEL: WILL THERE BE A HOLE TO CRAWL IN?

<TEXT>
<P>
My name is Mack and I have taken over as the general manager of the San Diego 
Padres, residents of the second division of the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
I take a look at my roster and conclude there are holes . . . many holes. OK, 
maybe not many holes, but big holes. Looking at this roster is like flying over 
the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that my first baseman is leaving to poison the acreage elsewhere, I 
have chasms at first base, shortstop and center field. 
</P>
<P>
Now, my mandate is to shake things up without having to open my wallet and blow 
money on high-profile, high-priced free agents. You know, your hand can get 
awfully tired writing all those zeroes and commas on paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
What I have to do is move things around, make things happen. I have to get the 
fans thinking San Diego Padre baseball rather than Charger football or USIU 
basketball or Gull hockey or whatever the off-season distractions might be 
hereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
I'll make a trade. 
</P>
<P>
This will be a doozy. 
</P>
<P>
I'll trade second baseman Robbie Alomar and left fielder Joe Carter to the 
Toronto Blue Jays for first baseman Fred McGriff and shortstop Tony Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Voila! (No, not Viola, voila!) 
</P>
<P>
 This one really works. That radio station with listeners from Nome to Rome is 
abuzz for days. You wouldn't have thought anyone else was home around here but 
the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me now review what I have. I take Bip Roberts and move him from third base 
to second base, so he replaces Alomar. Perfect. Now I only have holes at third 
base, left field and center field. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City has this guy I'd like to have. His name is Danny Tartabull. I think 
it's Danny Tartabull. I'd better check and make sure it isn't Jose Tartabull. 
If it's Danny, I'd play him in left field. I do have a hole there. 
</P>
<P>
OK, Kansas City wants Bip Roberts. No problem. I'll trade Roberts to Kansas 
City for Danny Tartabull. 
</P>
<P>
Wow! 
</P>
<P>
 This one takes 'em by storm, too. The receptionist says the telephones have 
been ringing off the hook. Obviously, the fans around here are excited. 
</P>
<P>
Hmmm, where are we now? 
</P>
<P>
I have Tartabull in left field and Fernandez at short and McGriff at first and 
I've given up Alomar, Carter and Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
Do I have any holes left? Oh yes, second base, third base and center field. 
</P>
<P>
Boy, I just love shopping like this. It reminds me of when I used to get to 
school late because I was trading bubble gum cards at the bike racks. 
</P>
<P>
I think I'll shake them up with another trade. It sure gets the Padres onto the 
front page. 
</P>
<P>
I know what I'll do. I'll get Kirby Puckett from the Minnesota Twins and we'll 
put him out in center field. Piece of cake. I'll send Tony Gwynn to Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Boom! 
</P>
<P>
 Boom? It's more like a sonic boom. Kaboom. This one is so big Channel 8 has to 
cut into Ted Leitner's diatribe with a sports report. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew I could rebuild this club with trades. I knew it wouldn't be necessary 
to waste the owners' profits on free agents. I wonder if I'll have to wait 
until 1991 to get my first Christmas bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Holes? Any left? Let's see, second base, third base and right field. 
</P>
<P>
I'd better take care of second base. How's this one? I'm going to trade Benito 
Santiago to the Texas Rangers for Julio Franco. 
</P>
<P>
Gasp! 
</P>
<P>
 You're right. I never cease to amaze them with my wheeling and dealing. That 
one even gets a reaction from the White House. Seems the Prez had warned his 
son about dealing with me. 
</P>
<P>
 A man's work is never done, is it? I have to stay at it until I get this club 
rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a second while I move my marbles around. I need a catcher, third baseman 
and right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
Before I forget, I better get a third baseman. Aha! Tim Wallach. I'll get him 
from the Montreal Expos. Easy. I'll send them Fred McGriff. He's used to 
Canadian currency anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Geez! 
</P>
<P>
 Eat your heart out, Trader Jack. You never got this much reaction. Neither did 
Trader Lane or Trader Vic or Traitor Benedict. Look at all those fans out there 
on my front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 What next? Don't you think I should be about done? What could be left? 
</P>
<P>
I have changed the face of this club without spending a nickel. And now my only 
holes are at catcher, first base and right field. 
</P>
<P>
How many did I start with? 
</P>
<P>
I forget. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching? 
</P>
<P>
Did someone mention pitching? 
</P>
<P>
Aw, you can always find pitching. All I have to do is punch the buttons on my 
red-hot telephone. Maybe I'll trade Tony Fernandez to Oakland for Eric Show. 
</P>
<P>
That'll cause another run on season tickets, won't it?

INSIDE-OUTSIDE DUO CARRIES UCSD TO WIN

The UC San Diego men's basketball team once again knocked out its opponent with 
the one-two punch. 
</P>
<P>
If Tim Rapp wasn't scoring from the outside, Rick Batt was shooting from the 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
The combination helped UCSD defeat La Verne, 103-72, Wernesday at Triton Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Rapp scored 26 points, all in the first half, matching his average. He shot 
twice in the second half but was taken out of the game after three minutes of 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Rapp, a 6-foot-4 senior guard, was nine-for-15 from the field, four-for-five 
from three-point range, and four-for-six from the line. Rapp led UCSD (7-0) 
with five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim has been playing very well," UCSD Coach Tom Marshall said. "His average 
doesn't depict how good he really is, because I usually take him out in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We pride ourselves on depth, and I'm really pleased to see the second five 
that came in in the second half maintained the point spread." 
</P>
<P>
After Rapp left the game, Batt, who had just four points in the first half, 
picked up the slack, scoring 12 consecutive points at the start of the second 
half to break open a 26-point lead (77-49) for UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Batt, who totalled 18 points and three rebounds, left the game with 10 minutes 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, they decided to deny me the ball and face-guard me," Rapp 
said. "Rick was able to score from the inside. The key to our game in the 
inside/outside combination." 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons, ranked third in the nation in Division III, never trailed once 
they took a 19-18 lead with 13 minutes remaining in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, UCSD had a 54-35 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons were a bit sluggish, trailing 7-1, in the opening two minutes of 
the game but Marshall said that once Tom Shawcroft hit two three-pointers, 
helping to bring UCSD within two, his team's momentum picked up. 
</P>
<P>
Shawcroft, a senior and a Granite Hills' graduate, ended with 18 points and 
made alkl four of his three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach got on us because we were kind of lackadaisical at the start," Rapp 
said. "But after five or six minutes, we made a concerted effort to put the 
press on them and kept them from scoring." 
</P>
<P>
La Verne (4-4) was led by Ross Wilkins, who scored 24 points and had 18 
rebounds.

MONTANA PROLONGS THE AGONY FOR USIU

<P>
Not more than 15 minutes after U.S. International's 21-point loss Monday to 
Fairleigh Dickinson, Coach Gary Zarecky wore the look of a crop farmer who had 
spotted a tornado on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Calmly, he said, "Losing can become a habit, a real deadly mental set." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the twister hit. 
</P>
<P>
And like the farmer in the swirling wind, Zarecky sat helplessly at courtside 
Wednesday minus three players -- one had quit after Monday -- and watched the 
remaining nine get blown out by Montana, 104-86, in front of at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Gulls to 1-8 and 0-4 at home. And they must embark on a 
four-game swing on the road -- where they've won one of their last 18 -- 
starting Saturday in Des Moines, Iowa against Drake. 
</P>
<P>
They won't depart with much on which to reflect. After being tied late in the 
first half, Montana (5-3 and 3-0 now against USIU) outscored the Gulls, 48-15. 
The Grizzlies, sparked by guard Gary Kane, who came off the bench to make five 
three-point shots, built a 33-point lead, 87-54, with under eight minutes to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
USIU trailed by seven midway through a cold-shooting first half for both teams. 
But when the pace heated up during the final six minutes, so did the Gulls, who 
tied the game, 39-39, on a three-point play by guard Kevin Bradshaw with 51 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Then Montana's Kevin Kearney hit a short jump shot and Bradshaw, getting a rare 
pick and an open shot, missed. Montana got the ball back and Gary Kane, a 
freshman from Butte, Montana who finished with 20, bombed in the first of his 
three-pointers from the wing, barely beating the buzzer. Montana led, 44-39. 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky said the first thing he noticed when he got into the locker room at 
halftime was a "glazed look" on faces of his players. A look quite similar to 
the one Zarecky wore Monday. USIU chipped the margin down to 18 as Montana 
cleared its bench. The Grizzlies' final 16 points came from the free-throw line 
after Gulls fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Again, one of few bright spots for USIU was the scoring of Bradshaw, who 
finished with a game-high 39 points and tied former Serra High player Steve 
Smith as the second all-time leading scorer in Gulls history when he forced in 
a three-pointer as the game ended. But even Bradshaw saw the storm on the 
horizon after Montana's late first-half flurry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that broke our backs," he said. "A lot of guys came out in the second 
half with their heads down." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with this team is its mentality," Zarecky said. "It has no 
confidence in it's shooting game." 
</P>
<P>
Nate Atchison led Montana with 22 points, while Kearney added 20. The Gulls got 
18 from forward Isaac Brown and 14 from freshman guard Mark Tuite. Tuite was 
one of three players Zarecky called his "young guns" before the season. One of 
the three, Steve Whitehead, quit the team after Monday's loss.

LINCOLN COMES CLOSE, BUT NO. 4 POWAY PULLS OUT 84-76 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
No one really gave Lincoln's boys' basketball team a chance when it played at 
No. 4 Poway High School on Thursday night. The No. 5 Hornets had blown a 
three-point lead with 36 seconds left in its last game against Mt. Miguel. It 
had lost by 27 points to No. 10 Mt. Carmel earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
People were beginning to wonder about the five-time City Central League 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
Poway Coach Doug Wealch was wondering. 
</P>
<P>
But after escaping with an 84-76 victory, Wealch wasn't wondering. He was a 
believer. "Lincoln played out of their heads," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Coach Ron Loneski also believes. "I started four juniors and one 
senior, Loneski said. "These kids are going to get better. 
</P>
<P>
"If they play like they did tonight. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Loneski didn't finish the statement, but he didn't have to. He was more or less 
in awe of his team's effort. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Barry Randle scored 23 points and Lincoln went on a 14-4 run to pull to 
within 75-74 with 2:46 left in the game before the Titans got some key rebounds 
from Kirk Hipple and a clutch three-point basket by Bill Rarity to put the game 
out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to play," Rarity said, "we can play with the best." 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln, which was playing without starter Don Ballard (out with injuries 
sustained in an auto accident), was whistled for 30 fouls and had three players 
foul out. Poway was called for 19 fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Poway made 28 of 40 free throws, Lincoln 17 of 28. 
</P>
<P>
Poway (2-0) took a 63-55 lead into the fourth quarter -- the Titans led 42-33 
at halftime -- but Lincoln took advantage of its quickness to once again wipe 
out a Titan lead. At 75-74, Poway's Kyle Milling's basket increased the lead to 
three, then Rarity, who finished with 20 points, banked a three-point basket 
off the glass with 1:06 left to make it 80-76. 
</P>
<P>
Milling added four more free throws in the final 33 seconds as Hipple, a 
junior, kept pulling down rebounds for the Titans. Hipple finished with 10 
rebounds despite playing about 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln outrebounded Poway 46-28. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Wuchner had 19 points for Poway and Milling quietly added 14. He had eight 
in the fourth quarter, six from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Garrett and Hipple scored nine apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Randle was the only Hornet in double figures. John Akridge and Archie Robinson 
scored nine apiece. Randle, Akridge and Dennis Washington fouled out. MARTIN

RESTAURANT REVIEW MISCHA; 
</P>
<P>
VINTAGE CUISINE; 
</P>
<P>
A MONTECITO WINE STORE HAS GIVEN WAY TO AN ATTRACTIVE, VERY GOOD RESTAURANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GOLDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time there was a wine store in Montecito. It was called Wine 
Festival -- and it was not selling as much wine as its owners thought it 
should. 
</P>
<P>
But the owners had the imagination, and the resources, to turn the store 
around. These days there are two signs in front. The old one says "Wine 
Festival" (the store); the new one says "Mischa" (the restaurant). The 
combination produces a very good restaurant with a very good selection of wines 
that can be consumed on or off the premises. 
</P>
<P>
In order to make room for tables while continuing to stock wine, owners Alan 
and Mary Jane Matoza had to make the wine shelves a lot higher; it's not 
unusual to walk into Mischa and see Alan up on a ladder, searching for a 
bottle. While they were condensing the wine display, the Matozas painted the 
walls white, laid gray carpet, put in a wine bar, added some vivid paintings on 
the walls and a mixture of sophisticated jazz and subdued classical music on 
the sound system. The result is one of the area's more relaxed and attractive 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
To complete the metamorphosis, the Matozas hired Michael Ingertson to set up 
the menu and the kitchen. On paper, this would not seem an especially astute 
move, because Ingertson had no professional restaurant experience. But 
Ingertson's meals have turned out to be very professional. 
</P>
<P>
I'd go back any time just for the grilled pork chop, which is cooked with 
apples and red onions sauteed with Calvados. On the side is warm red cabbage, 
cooked in the German style but not too sweet, and an inventive sweet potato 
gratin. The real plus in this dish? The chef's ability to send it out moist and 
dripping with juices. 
</P>
<P>
The swordfish is about three quarters of an inch thick, served in what at least 
a couple of us call a "fabulous" rosemary aioli sauce. On the side are roasted 
red potatoes and a salad of raw zucchini and sweet red peppers, which 
beautifully offsets the strong flavors of the aioli. 
</P>
<P>
When we ordered the fish we were told that the chef cooks it medium rare, and 
if we wanted it another way we should say so. We didn't say so. It was just 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Ingertson's sauces and broths, especially those on the appetizers, are full of 
character. I was especially fond of the broth he makes with Chardonnay, cream, 
tomato, salt, white pepper and saffron, with mussels, prawns and scallops added 
at the last minute. The texture of the fish is attractive, and the saffron is 
an inspired touch. 
</P>
<P>
There was a wonderful sauce on an appetizer I ordered one night -- capellini 
pasta with mussels and asparagus in a saffron cream. My companion liked it so 
much I kept catching her reaching across the table to dip her bread into my 
sauce. It had more character, she said, than her own fettuccine with tomatoes 
and asparagus in roasted garlic cream. She was right. 
</P>
<P>
I'd also pass on the Hama Hama oysters. The oysters themselves were quite good, 
but they were not improved by the champagne sauce with black pepper. And 
although a tart of roasted fennel, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, olives and basil 
sounded as if it would have some real flavor excitement, it was just too 
subtle. The oyster and fennel soup, however, managed to be subtle, subdued and 
flavorful, all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
If you're there for lunch, there are a couple of variations on Mischa's dinner 
menu. One is a sandwich of grilled filet steak served on a baguette with 
sauteed peppers and onions. The meat is spectacular -- tender and tasty. The 
other lunch item of note is also a sandwich -- grilled Gruyere and Monterey 
Jack cheeses served with zinfandel-sauteed mushrooms and watercress on 
sourdough bread. 
</P>
<P>
The report on Mischa's desserts is mixed. The bread pudding in a cognac sauce 
is a winner; it's so good, in fact, you can't help wishing there were more of 
it. And it would be hard to beat the homemade ice creams. But as good as they 
sound, neither the bourbon-pecan tart with Chantilly cream nor the raspberry 
and dark chocolate cream tart lived up to the rest of the menu. 
</P>
<P>
Wine Festival may not have sold a lot of wine, but I hope Mischa is destined to 
sell a lot of food.

BRUCE HORNSBY, WHO HAS BEEN KEPT BUSY BY SUCCESS LATELY, WRAPS UP HIS TOUR WITH 
A VENTURA GIG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two-time Grammy award winner Bruce Hornsby must be one of the nicest guys in 
rock 'n' roll -- maybe a Mr. Rogers at the piano. He's obviously got a lot of 
musical pals. Seemingly, he's played on everybody's albums lately, and almost 
everybody has played on his records. People he's recorded with recently include 
Don Henley, The Grateful Dead, Marti Jones, Cheap Trick, Bob Segar, Bob Dylan, 
Leon Russell and Branford Marsalis. Just about everybody but Milli Vanilli 
covering Paul Simon's "Sounds of Silence." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hornsby and The Range (his three-piece backup band) will conclude their 
current tour Sunday night at the Ventura Concert Theatre with a two-show 
benefit for the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to play there," Hornsby said in a recent telephone 
interview. "I've been there before, but never to play. I saw my buddies, 
Ambrosia, recently at the Ventura Theatre. We'll be doing two nights at the 
Universal Amphitheatre in L.A., then our tour ends with the Ventura show." 
</P>
<P>
And so far, there's no hint of a cancellation of the show, from either the 
theater management or the city of Ventura. The Grateful Dead are permanently 
gonged from playing Ventura, but maybe the city has a One Dead Dude Rule. Bob 
Weir played the venue recently and now Hornsby is coming. Maybe nobody knows 
that he plays with the Dead. 
</P>
<P>
"We opened for the Dead about four years ago," Hornsby said. "They've had other 
opening acts the last few years, too -- Edie Brickell, Los Lobos, 10,000 
Maniacs and Bonnie Raitt. Anyway, I've always been a Dead fan, and after we 
opened that time, I sat in with them for a few songs, which became a couple of 
nights, and now I play with them whenever I can. 
</P>
<P>
"Vince Welnick is the new full-time Dead dude -- I'm just a part-timer. And, 
you know, Jerry Garcia played on my latest album. I did the recent European 
tour with the Dead -- most of the fans turned out to be Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Hornsby and friends' current record, "A Night on the Town," the band's third, 
is more mellow, piano rock with a thesaurus-load of insightful lyrics dealing 
with Important Issues such as klan violence, drunk rednecks on a Saturday night 
and trying to find someone to hang out with who is not crazy. 
</P>
<P>
And what's the first thing you think of when you hear the word lawyer? 
Introspective and sensitive, right? Sure. Hornsby's writing partner is his 
brother, John, a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it's great to be able to play music and make a buck at it," Hornsby 
said. "We really enjoy what we're doing. We're not a bunch of serioso artistes 
-- we're not a bunch of plastic posers. One thing people seem to misunderstand 
about us is that we are much more intense live than we are on record. For some 
reason, the records are softer, but our piano, bass rock music is absolutely 
better live." 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura gig will probably be a basic sit-down show with not a lot of wild 
dancing -- sort of like a PBS show where people pay attention, and probably not 
much like the band's recent Ocean City, Md., show. "We got to the show," 
Hornsby said, "and the marquee read '$100 Bikini Contest' in great big letters 
while we were in little bitty letters. They ended up canceling the bikini 
contest . . . but this heavy metal band opened for us. I'm not a big metal fan. 
It would be a nightmare to have somebody like Anthrax or Queensryche open for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Hornsby's success is a basic rock-rags-to-rolling-in-riches story, just another 
10-year, overnight sensation. 
</P>
<P>
"I started playing piano at 17 -- kind of late, I guess, but I really got 
intense about it. Then, when I was 23, I started writing songs and got really 
intense about that. I worked at 20th Century-Fox for a while as a staff writer 
and they'd have me do stuff like write a song for Kenny Rogers. I wasn't very 
good at it, but I learned a lot about writing. Then I played around and tried 
to get a record deal for seven or eight years, and finally I got signed by RCA. 
It's a fairly typical story, really." 
</P>
<P>
Now Hornsby is almost too busy to pay attention. He's the guy who's never home. 
The "occupant" mail must be three feet deep on his porch. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived in L. A. for 10 years, and I just moved back to Virginia. No 
Angels' games back there; Mark Langston is my buddy. Anyway, I've been home 18 
days this year." 
</P>
<P>
So what advice does he have for those young piano virtuosos, the next Bruce 
Hornsbys, the little kids chained to the big old Baldwin piano? 
</P>
<P>
"You need to be your own worst critic. People are usually much more critical of 
other people than they are of themselves. It's in your head, not what's in the 
store."

*One Love Vibration (Alex's Cantina, 5918 Hollister Ave., Goleta, 683-2577) 
Yup, there are two Alex's but only One Love Vibration, doing rockin' reggae, 
mon. 
</P>
<P>
FRIDAY 
</P>
<P>
*Rob Rio &amp; The Revolvers (Oxnard Community Center, 351 South B St., Oxnard, 
487-5351) The King of the Boogie Woogie Piano brings his infectious dance music 
to the city that's more than just a pretty name. 
</P>
<P>
*One Love Vibration (Charlie's) Yup, it's them again. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Downey Band (Fess Parker's Red Lion Resort, 630 E. Cabrillo Ave., Santa 
Barbara, 564-4333) So do you think Fess will get up and sing some Davy Crockett 
songs with Leo, the man who never takes a day off? Nah . . . 
</P>
<P>
*Crucial DBC (Alex's Cantina, Santa Barbara) Santa Barbara reggae monsters 
compete for the Friday night State Street crowd. 
</P>
<P>
SATURDAY 
</P>
<P>
*Toad The Wet Sprocket, Spencer The Gardener, The I-Rails, The Mudheads (Alex's 
Cantina, Santa Barbara) It's a powerhouse lineup of local talent performing a 
bass-a-thon benefit. No, not the ale or the fish. All proceeds from the door go 
toward replacing the bass guitar recently ripped off from the I-Rails' bassist 
and singer, Chris O'Connor, by some lowdown, rotten weasel. By the way, the 
I-Rails' fourth tape is great. 
</P>
<P>
*Tempting Souls (Charlie's) Horns, horns and more horns do Motown and classic 
R&amp;B at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
*Leo Downey Band, Michael On Fire (Fess Parker's Red Lion Resort) A few weeks 
ago Leo caught a Michael On Fire gig at Joseppi's, then Leo caught fire. And 
now Michael is opening for Leo, making for musical pyrotechnics that may 
require asbestos underwear. They're going to play separately, then jam 
together. Also on the bill is harmonica god Lee Oskar. 
</P>
<P>
SUNDAY 
</P>
<P>
*The Mudheads, Something For Nothing, The I-Rails, Expression (Ventura College, 
Quad area) This 11 a.m. show is sort of an anti-war concert featuring four 
excellent local bands plus some angry speakers of the "hell, no, we won't go" 
persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
*Matt Schulte &amp; Bill Coffey (Charlie's) Two super-duper folk singers who 
harmonize like nobody's business or the Everly Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
*Bruce Hornsby &amp; The Range (Ventura Concert Theatre, 26 S. Chestnut St., 
Ventura) It's mellow and insightful piano rock by the two-time Grammy award 
winner doing 8 and 10 p.m. shows. 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY 
</P>
<P>
*Mosaic (Charlie's) Real tight folk rock by Evans &amp; Van Loan plus their 
backing band. 
</P>
<P>
*The Pontiax (Alexander's, 1050 Schooner Drive, Ventura, 658-2000) Excellent, 
veteran local blues band with a new tape and lots of fans. 
</P>
<P>
*Pat, Fin &amp; Greg (The Grill) Again. 
</P>
<P>
TUESDAY 
</P>
<P>
*Official Resistance (Charlie's) They're loud; they're angry; they have cute 
girlfriends. Here they are. 
</P>
<P>
WEDNESDAY 
</P>
<P>
*Ariel (Charlie's) Original rock band from Ventura that's about to become the 
next local signing, or so they say -- but you know how optimistic these 
rock-and-rollers can be. But still, they have some spiffy one-of-a-kind tunes. 
Check 'em out. 
</P>
<P>
*The Pontiax (Alex's Cantina, S.B.) Blues before the home folks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yup, it's only rock 'n' roll and thus these listings are subject to change. 
Mom was right -- call first.

THEATER REVIEW 'BRIGHTON BEACH MEMOIRS'; 
</P>
<P>
THE FAMILY WAY; 
</P>
<P>
VENTURA COLLEGE'S WELL-RECEIVED NEIL SIMON PRODUCTION CONCLUDES SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
One of the most impressive aspects of the current Ventura College production of 
"Brighton Beach Memoirs" is the way the audience, seemingly drawn for the most 
part from the college community, responded so positively to the nostalgia of a 
man old enough to be their grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Simon's semi-autobiographical play is set in Brooklyn in 1937, a far cry 
indeed from 1990 Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the crowd on Sunday afternoon seemed to identify with the life of a 
second-generation, lower-middle-class Jewish family in Depression-era New York. 
Some aspects of family life are, indeed, universal. 
</P>
<P>
Elliot Nahmias plays Eugene Jerome, the 14-year-old aspiring writer who 
occasionally steps outside the story to narrate it. 
</P>
<P>
His family includes his parents, Jack and Kate, and Eugene's elder brother, 
Stanley. Also living in the house are Kate's sister, Blanche, whose two 
daughters, Nora and Laurie, are about the same ages as Stanley and Eugene, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The Jerome family is facing trouble, or at least change, from several 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
Jack is having health and job problems, and Stanley is on the verge of losing 
his job over a matter of personal ethics. Nora wants to leave home to pursue a 
career on the stage, and Laurie's heart problems essentially confine her to the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
If that's not enough to keep a play going for two hours, sisters Kate and 
Blanche may be headed for a confrontation they've been able to avoid for their 
entire adult lives. And if the Jeromes' relatives are able to flee 
German-occupied Poland successfully, where will they stay? 
</P>
<P>
All of these situations are faced and answered before the end of "Brighton 
Beach Memoirs," and Simon manages to do so in a generally satisfying manner 
that draws as many laughs as tears. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene, the Simon surrogate, is the play's central character, and Nahmias is 
convincing in the role -- though he's clearly several years too old for the 
part, a problem that the audience has to ignore to appreciate Libbey Lazarus' 
portrayal of the spoiled youngster, Laurie. 
</P>
<P>
More believable are the older characters, with John Medeiros especially 
noteworthy as the overworked father, and William F. McDonald as brother 
Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
Simon has some trouble writing female characters without a comic edge, giving 
Sara Nesson, Verity George and Roberta Lakavage relatively little to work with 
as Kate, Blanche and Nora. 
</P>
<P>
They all do well with what they're given. 
</P>
<P>
Direction, by the V.C. theater department's Jay Varela with selected scenes 
supervised by Tony Marciel and Anna Quirino, is efficient and assured. 
</P>
<P>
Technical director Willy Eck has designed a quite remarkable set, and both 
costumes (Abra Flores) and makeup (Edwin Barron) are commendable. 
</P>
<P>
The first third of a trilogy that also includes "Biloxi Blues" and "Broadway 
Bound," this is one of Simon's most well-rounded works. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura College production is worth seeing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
"Brighton Beach Memoirs" concludes this weekend, with performances at 8 p.m. 
Friday and Saturday nights, and at 3 Sunday afternoon. General admission 
tickets are $7 for adults, $5 for students, seniors and Ventura College staff, 
and $3 per tickets for groups of 10 or more. Ventura College is at 4667 
Telegraph Road in Ventura, though the theater faces Loma Vista Road on the 
north side of the campus. Call (805) 654-6459 for reservations or additional

THE POP ROCK BAND HAS PLAYED THURSDAY NIGHTS AT ALEX'S CANTINA ON STATE STREET 
FOR THREE YEARS AND NEVER MISSED A DATE.

When classifying pop rock, the important thing to remember is that neatness 
counts. Pop rock has melodies you can remember if not recreate in the shower -- 
the stuff that lives in your head. Pop rock has vocals you can understand -- no 
pop rock vocalist shrieks as if he's getting his fingernails torn off between 
cat fights in a machine shop. Pop rock songs have structure -- they have a 
beginning, a middle and an end. Pop rock songs are usually pretty short, so if 
you don't like one, wait a minute. 
</P>
<P>
Pop rock is sweet. How sweet? It's ear candy; and if your ears were teeth, 
they'd have cavities. It's cotton candy with a beat. It's a rocking Twinkie 
that's bigger than a Chrysler. And it's alive and well -- especially in Santa 
Barbara where Pat, Fin &amp; Greg have been doing the pop rock thing for years. 
</P>
<P>
What's predictable? The sun will rise? The IRS doesn't like you? Your 
mother-in-law doesn't like you? The Cubs won't win the pennant? How about Pat, 
Fin &amp; Greg? They've played Thursday nights at Alex's Cantina on State 
Street for three years and have never missed a date. I'll bet they show up this 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, a couple of years ago State Street was dead," Fin Seth said in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
"We sort of got this whole thing started," he said, pointing out the window to 
State Street, which was doing a pretty fair imitation of the Mardi Gras on a 
Thursday night. "We've been playing here at Alex's for three years, never 
missed a date -- we have a lot of fans. We send out 500 mailers each month." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of fans is right. By the middle of the first song, some of the band's 
fans were doing the wave, or trying, at least. By the third song, the place was 
packed. And the competition on lower State Street is intense. Something seems 
to be happening in every little hole-in-the-wall joint. 
</P>
<P>
Pat, Fin &amp; Greg play several times a week, mostly in Santa Barbara. Pat 
Milliken and Greg Brallier play acoustic guitars and Fin Seth plays electric 
bass. They play enough not to have day jobs. Seth and Brallier also have 
another band, The Tearaways -- which seems like Pat, Fin &amp; Greg on 
steroids, or with a keyboard player and a drummer. Seth and Brallier have been 
a part of the Santa Barbara music scene a long time. They used to be The 
Volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm originally from North Dakota," Seth said, "but I've been in Santa Barbara 
for 15 years. I was going to Dos Pueblos High School and Greg was going to 
UCSB. We both liked the same kind of music -- the kind that has real singing. 
And our voices blend so well. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, after we finally got together, we played as the Volcanoes for three 
years -- the band broke up in 1987. Then we got Pat who was doing a lot of solo 
stuff to play guitar, and here we are. Pat, Fin &amp; Greg is not serious at 
all, just fun. But we do 250 gigs or so a year. This is what we do." 
</P>
<P>
The trio could probably play longer than the Grateful Dead -- they know about 
1,000 songs, mostly classics. They do stuff like "Angie," "Walk on the Wild 
Side," "Cinnamon Girl," "Bus Stop," a bunch of Beatles songs and some Tearaways 
originals. They even take requests. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get stumped too often," Seth said. "We're pros at this acoustic 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
And these guys can sing. They have these heavenly, happening harmonies that 
most of those yahoos on MTV can only dream about. Usually, it's Seth and 
Brallier harmonizing, but sometimes Milliken joins in too, and it makes those 
little bitty hairs on the back of your neck want to get up and dance. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg and I are classic rock fans," Seth said. "We like the Beatles, the 
Stones, Cheap Trick, the Plimsouls -- bands with real songs. But it's tough in 
Santa Barbara. We've played in L.A. before and the record label people don't 
know what to make of us. We don't sound like this week's hot band." 
</P>
<P>
So they struggle along, packing houses in Santa Barbara and waiting for 
Something Big to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Toad the Wet Sprocket got signed -- it can happen," Seth said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not necessarily where you're at, it's just if the right person sees you. 
Like, we've never had an article written about us." 
</P>
<P>
How's this for a mini-US Festival of pop rockers: the Beatles, Bad Company, 
R.E.M., Jellyfish, Durango 95 and Pat, Fin &amp; Greg? It probably wouldn't 
change your life, but you'd have plenty to sing about in the shower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
Pat, Fin &amp; Greg appear Thursday at Alex's Cantina, 633 State St., Santa 
Barbara. For information call 966-0032. So what else can you do for a buck? The 
trio also plays Mondays at The Grill in Montecito.

GOINGS ON SANTA BARBARA; 
</P>
<P>
'AMAHL' RETURNS; 
</P>
<P>
THE REWORKING OF MENOTTI'S OPERETTA IS A POPULAR LOCAL CHRISTMAS TRADITION.

OK, so maybe the Santa Claus in Santa Barbara's Paseo Nuevo shopping center is 
a "Santa by the Sea" and sits upon a coral throne. And so what if the Santa in 
the town's Christmas parade earlier this month rode around in a red Rolls-Royce 
convertible instead of his usual sleigh? Just like the rest of the country, 
Santa Barbara does follow Christmas traditions -- but it sometimes follows the 
beat of a different Drummer Boy. 
</P>
<P>
One favorite local Christmas tradition, Repertory-West and Friends Dance 
Company's annual presentation of "Amahl and the Night Visitors," will be 
performed Monday at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 3 and 8 p.m. at the Lobero Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The story of a lame boy and his widowed mother who offer the three Magi a place 
to stay for the night was originally written as an operetta for television by 
Gian Carlo Menotti, who won two Pulitzer Prizes for his work. Members of 
Repertory-West approached Menotti about the operetta in 1983 and transformed it 
into a work of modern dance, song and theater. 
</P>
<P>
Screen and stage actor John Ireland, a Santa Barbara resident, will read Dylan 
Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales" before the presentation. Tickets are 
$12.75. 963-0761. 
</P>
<P>
La Casa de la Raza will hold its 20th annual Posada Christmas celebration 
Wednesday at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Posada, meaning "inn," is a traditional Latin American Christmas procession 
representing Mary and Joseph's search for lodging. Participants at La Casa de 
la Raza are randomly divided into two groups. Everyone is given a candle and a 
song sheet, the lights are turned off and then the group outside of the 
building sings to the group inside asking for lodging, and the indoor group 
replies. The free event draws about 400 people yearly, 965-8581. 
</P>
<P>
Headless Household, a group that plays original jazz, rock, polka, surf music, 
funk, and anything else they might think of, might even perform some Christmas 
tunes -- Santa Barbara style -- in its upcoming concert. 
</P>
<P>
"Silver Bells Tolling," which guitarist Joe Woodard describes as a cross 
between "Silver Bells" and "For Whom the Bell Tolls," is an example of the 
group's alternative approach to caroling. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the show Monday at 8 p.m. at the Center Stage Theatre in the Paseo 
Nuevo shopping center are $8.50. 963-0408. 
</P>
<P>
For holiday music in a more traditional vein, Messiah Sing-Along, which will 
benefit the Council of Christmas Cheer, will be held at the First Presbyterian 
Church at State and Constance streets Sunday at 3:30 p.m. The program will be 
taped and later broadcast on KDB-FM (93.7). Tickets are $5. 966-4131. 
</P>
<P>
While people in other parts of the country are decorating trees and skating on 
lakes and ponds, Santa Barbarans will be decorating their boats and heading for 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Parade of Lights will include about 50 festive boats plus a Coast 
Guard cutter carrying Santa. Spectators can view the parade Sunday at 6 p.m. 
all along Cabrillo Boulevard and at the Harbor Breakwater and Stearns Wharf. 
969-5217. 
</P>
<P>
The heavens will be putting on their own parade of lights Thursday and Friday 
as up to 50 "shooting stars" per hour streak across the sky in one of the 
brightest meteor displays of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The observation pad at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History is a good 
place to view the meteor shower. Telescopes will be put out and staff members 
will be on hand to give talks and answer questions. Admission is $1 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the Museum of Natural History, the Celtic Ensemble Queen Mab will 
perform its modern renditions of traditional Irish ballads and dance tunes. 
Plus, tales for the Winter Solstice will be added to the show Dec. 14 at 7:30 
p.m. That's $6. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Street Theatre is ending 1990 with "The Year's Best Fest," featuring 
the best foreign films of the year. The fest began last week with Akira 
Kurosawa's "Dreams." Maurizio Nichetti's "The Icicle Thief" runs through 
tomorrow. And "Cinema Paradiso" directed by Giuseppe Tornatore will be shown 
Saturday through Monday. "Jesus of Montreal," directed by Denys Arcand, runs 
Tuesday through Dec. 20. Tickets are $4. 965-1886.

THEATER REVIEW 'RECKLESS';

<P>
CRUEL YULE; 
</P>
<P>
IF ALICE FELL DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE, RACHEL IS A CAT BEING DRAGGED THROUGH A 
KNOTHOLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN VAN DER VEER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Craig Lucas' black comedy "Reckless" has found the right director. Pope 
Freeman's intense multilayered production at Santa Barbara City College's 
Studio Theater is reminiscent of Antonin Artaud's "theater of cruelty." And it 
corroborates Jerzy Grotowski's theory that the content of theater should be 
"myths of the blood" rather than fictions bearing on social life and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The plot has Rachel, a sort of 20th-Century Alice in Wonderland, catapulted 
through a series of events that ostensibly have to do with social life and 
behavior -- but which may be fantasy, dream, memory or all three. Catapulted is 
not a strong enough image; if Alice fell down the rabbit hole, Rachel is a cat 
being dragged through a knothole. 
</P>
<P>
It starts on Christmas Eve. Rachel is a normal, if slightly hysterical, wife in 
her own home, happily stuffing Christmas stockings for her children, chatting 
to her husband who suddenly informs her that he has taken out a contract on her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Cut to a roadside telephone booth in the snow. Rachel, in robe and slippers, 
gets a ride with a stranger, Lloyd, who takes her home to live with him and his 
deaf paraplegic girlfriend (who isn't really deaf and who may be his mother). 
Rachel changes her name, gets a job and life goes on. 
</P>
<P>
On the next Christmas Eve, Rachel's husband arrives at the door with a bottle 
of champagne. Within minutes, he and the paraplegic girlfriend (who is clad in 
reindeer horns and a fake red nose) die a horrible death by poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Cut to Rachel and Lloyd (comatose and wearing a Santa Claus suit), who are back 
in the car running away to a new life, where they will change their names 
again. Lloyd will refuse to take off the Santa Claus suit or stop drinking 
champagne until the next Christmas, when he dies too. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel is on the road again, and we follow her through several more bizarre 
Christmases, interspersed with scenes in which she tries to explain to various 
obtuse psychiatrists what has happened. 
</P>
<P>
The funny thing is that it could all be true. Freeman has directed the actors 
to play it straight, as if it were true. This somehow creates a chilling effect 
that activates a seldom used section of our funny bone: We find ourselves 
laughing hysterically when Lloyd finally keels over in his Santa Claus suit; 
then we feel embarrassed when we realize that we are laughing at his death. But 
before we can buffer that, we are whisked off to the next incredible event. 
Nothing comes to rest in itself. Every event calls forth a new horror clothed 
in everyday dress. 
</P>
<P>
The issues become life, death, sanity, recurrence, betrayal, recognition, 
salvation . . . the list is unfinished but it leads further away from mere 
social life and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The mise-en-scene deserves a paragraph -- the stage is a claustrophobic jumble 
of all the scenery and props needed for 20 scenes. Thus as two characters sit 
on the double bed, they are inches from the red automobile they will drive in 
the next scene. Two hanging video screens record some of the action. The effect 
is disturbing, disorienting, dreamlike and wholly effective. Douglas Tal 
Sanders is scenic and lighting designer. 
</P>
<P>
There are some good performances by Tom Rearden, Peter Alexander Flanders, 
Rachel Marie Bargiel, Even Caston and Aaron Levin. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas is an interesting playwright. His "Prelude to a Kiss" is on Broadway and 
was nominated for a Tony Award last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
"Reckless" at the Studio Theater, Santa Barbara City College West Campus, 721 
Cliff Drive. Plays at 8 p.m. today, Friday and Saturday. Tickets are $7, $5 
students and seniors. Call 965-5935.

THE POTTED PINE OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the practice of buying a new tree each year seems wasteful -- and purchasing 
a fake conifer isn't an option -- you may want to look into buying a potted 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
"You can buy a five- to six-foot tree that's in a 15-gallon container," said 
Michelle Dunn, manager of Nature's Best Nursery in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the best trees to use is the Aleppo pine," Dunn said. "It's a real 
compact tree that grows well in Southern California and is easy to prune a nice 
Christmas-tree shape."

Dunn said to keep the potted tree outside in full sun after the holiday season 
is over and the decorations are put away. "You'll also need to keep it well 
watered, especially during the summer -- water it a couple times a week." 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect to use the tree for more than two Yuletide celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
If it stays in the pot much longer than that, "it will start to get root-bound 
and soon after that it dies," she said. "The root system becomes choked and 
there's just not enough soil to sustain the tree." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn suggests transplanting the tree to your yard. "It's a good tree for 
all-around landscaping."

The Santa Paula Union High School District board chose Al Sandoval as its 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval, a Santa Paula native who runs a photo processing business, is serving 
his third year on the board. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is keeping kids in school. I want to see vocational education and 
other items that are interesting to everybody so they won't drop out, because 
the three Rs aren't doing it for them. That is my first priority," Sandoval 
said. "We have laid the groundwork, now we need to refine and find the bugs 
until we have what we really want." AMELIA CHAFFEE

SCHOOLS TO GET STATE FUNDS FOR 3 PROJECTS

The Moorpark school district will receive state funds early in 1991 to build a 
middle school, a continuation high school, and additional classrooms and a 
performing arts facility at Moorpark High School, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good news for us," Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Duffy told the school board Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the district's $25.5-million bond issue for new construction was 
rejected by voters. However, the state's $800-million bond issue for new school 
construction was successful. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark will receive more than $29.5 million after the cost estimates, done 
two years ago, are adjusted for inflation, Assistant Supt. Carmela Vignocchi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Duffy said it is possible that construction could be going on at all 
three sites at the same time, the most pressing need is for 32 classrooms and a 
performing arts facility, estimated to take two years, at Moorpark High. 
</P>
<P>
The middle school, to be on property in the east part of the city, will also 
take two years to build. The continuation high school will be in an industrial 
park and should be completed in one year. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

Bus riders in Thousand Oaks will be able to hop on a city bus without paying 
under a City Council decision to provide free rides during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks Transit buses will be free until the end of the month, said John 
Clement, city public works director. Passengers normally pay 75 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided Tuesday to add bus service on weekends from 10 a.m. to 7 
p.m. Daily bus service was extended 2 1/2 hours to 9 p.m., except for Christmas 
Eve and New Year's Eve. No buses will run Christmas or New Year's Day. PSYCHE

VICTIM RECLAIMS $700 THIEF MISSED

<P>
A 98-year-old Camarillo woman whose purse had been snatched reclaimed her 
stolen cash and purse after two gardeners discovered the $700 in the bushes of 
a Camarillo park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a little Christmas miracle," Ventura County Sheriff's 
Detective Keith Parks. 
</P>
<P>
Leona Lee's purse was snatched last month, shortly after she'd cashed some 
checks near the Camarillo Shopping Center. The bank teller had placed seven 
$100 bills in an envelope and Lee stuffed some remaining cash in her wallet. 
The thief apparently scavenged only the wallet and abandoned her purse without 
finding the envelope, Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Ishmael Lopez and Jerry Cline, employees of the Pleasant Valley 
Recreation and Park District, found the items while working at Charter Oak Park 
and took them to the sheriff's station in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"And an hour later it was back to the woman it was taken from," Parks said. 
"The tears just welled up in her eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Lee rewarded the two men with $50 each. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

Ventura County sheriff's deputies arrested a 20-year-old Ventura man in 
connection with the theft of $38,000 in jewelry after they found pawnshop sales 
slips signed in his name, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Merlin Leavitt is being held at Ventura County Jail on suspicion of burglary, 
grand theft auto, grand property theft and two outstanding Los Angeles County 
traffic warrants, Sgt. Bob Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bail was set at $15,243, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Brown, 46, reported jewelry missing from his home in Camarillo on 
Monday and told authorities that he suspected that the valuables were taken 
between May 22 and Dec. 8, Detective Steve Bourke said. The jewelry was not 
frequently worn, Bourke said. 
</P>
<P>
Leavitt was in custody on unrelated charges Tuesday when deputies recovered 
sales slips signed in his name from Get-Mor Loan &amp; Jewelry in Oxnard and 
Gems Loan &amp; Pawn Brokers in Thousand Oaks, Bourke said. Some of the 
valuables, including gold wedding bands, gold charms, several precious-stone 
rings and gold chains, may be recovered from the pawnshops, he said. KIRSTEN

HARBOR COMMISSION OKS 20-YEAR LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA DOWLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Port of Hueneme took a major step closer to becoming the nation's first 
regional cleanup center for catastrophic oil spills as Oxnard Harbor District 
commissioners agreed to lease a section of the port to an oil industry 
consortium for the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
At their meeting Monday, harbor commissioners agreed to lease 6.3 acres of the 
port to the oil industry's Marine Spill Response Corp. beginning at $1.03 
million a year. The lease includes a 104,000-square-foot building, berths for 
two vessels and an operations center at the deep-water port. 
</P>
<P>
If the lease is approved by the corporation's governing board, the port will 
gain national prestige as the training center for the oil industry's 
preparations to handle spills the size of the one created by the Exxon Valdez 
in Alaska last year. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year lease has a 10-year renewal option. The first year represents an 
increase of $600,000 over rents being paid by 10 tenants, who will need to 
relocate, said Anthony Taormina, port executive director. 
</P>
<P>
By 1992, the corporation, financed by a consortium of large oil companies, 
would have invested more than $60 million in equipment and improvements at the 
port. The center is expected to bring 65 full-time jobs as well as temporary 
and training positions. 
</P>
<P>
The corporation also plans to build a 12,000-square-foot operations center in 
Port Hueneme. The Oxnard Harbor District agreed to reimburse the corporation 
for $275,000 of the building's costs. The district will also pay $35,000 to 
improve its mooring system to handle a 240-foot spill recovery barge and a 
200-foot cleanup vessel. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the lease agreement, the harbor district also promised to spend 
$5,000 to $8,000 to clean up a stretch of pavement contaminated with high 
levels of oil-based waste. The suspected source of the contamination is a 
former spray-painting booth on the property and the past practice of spraying 
oil on the ground to control dust, Taormina said. 
</P>
<P>
"With the marine spill center, our port is certainly in the big leagues now," 
Commissioner Bob Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners passed a resolution Monday asking the county to exempt the 
lease from environmental reviews under the California Environmental Quality 
Act, arguing that the center would be housed in existing buildings that have 
been used for similar purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Under established financial agreements, the city of Port Hueneme will get about 
$50,000 for the first five years from the deal. DONNA DOWLING

"Pretty Woman" and "Total Recall" are playing musical chairs with the No. 1 
position on the Billboard rental chart. This week it's "Total Recall's" turn in 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
The competition has been too tough for "Another 48 HRS.," which jumped three 
places to No. 3 in its third chart week. In other months, it might have been 
No. 1 by now. But this sequel may yet muscle its way to No. 1. "Men at Work," 
with Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez, started fast but has slowed down just as 
quickly, moving up just one notch to No. 13. That small rise is an indication 
that it's close to peaking already and may not even make the Top 10. "Miami 
Blues" (No. 14), "I Love You to Death" (No. 16) and "The First Power" (No. 18) 
all started out as if they might be long-running Top 10 rentals, but fizzled 
fast.

Show-biz celebrities: Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em. Don't have a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
They're everywhere on the small screen, making political and product 
endorsements; blowing smoke in infomercials; blabbing on talk shows; promoting 
their movies, ghost-written autobiographies and other pet projects; being 
interviewed as filler on cable's movie channels; getting gossiped about on the 
tabloid shows; making videos. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Madonna, moreover, it's a celebrity shrewdly advertising her 
banned-from-MTV video by getting it shown and sermonizing about censorship on 
ABC's "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the next few days bring extended, dramatically dissimilar looks at 
two stars of truly legendary status. One is the late Marilyn Monroe, whose 
unfinished final movie is profiled in a Fox documentary at 9 tonight on 
Channels 11 and 6. The other is Frank Sinatra, whose 75th birthday is noted 
Sunday in a two-hour extravaganza on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna has been compared to Monroe in terms of the raw sexuality each has 
projected on the screen. However, the similarity stops with their blondeness. 
</P>
<P>
Even as a performer, Madonna comes across as a confident, controlling, 
calculating business and marketing mogul bent on navigating her own soaring 
flight. She exudes self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
Troubled and intensely insecure, Monroe exuded self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
It's impossible to separate the Monroe you see on the screen tonight from the 
Monroe you've heard about, the wounded bird whose personal and professional 
lives had plummeted by the late 1950s, the tragic figure who died of a 
controversial drug overdose in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Along with her sheer beauty and charisma, it's this vulnerability and emotional 
fragility that comes across so strikingly in Fox's otherwise thin and largely 
trivial "Marilyn: Something's Got to Give." 
</P>
<P>
With William Knoedelseder as executive producer and Henry Schipper as 
producer/writer/narrator, the hour is devoted to Monroe's problems during the 
making of "Something's Got to Give," the ultimately aborted 20th Century Fox 
comedy from which she was fired, then rehired just before her death. 
</P>
<P>
Footage from the film, with Monroe looking gorgeous despite her problems, is 
fun to see, and even more fascinating are some outtakes that appear to capture 
her in unguarded moments. In a way, these fragments tenderly define the essence 
of her appeal, and while watching them you want to reach through the screen and 
embrace her. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, the program is an hour of strung-together footnotes -- 
cataloguing Monroe's tardiness and inexcusably difficult behavior on the set -- 
seemingly aimed more at trivia buffs than at the general viewer. 
</P>
<P>
We learn, for example, that Monroe did not bolt the movie but actually had 
permission to fly to New York to sing "Happy Birthday" to President John F. 
Kennedy. Whoopee. 
</P>
<P>
And we learn that Monroe's skinny-dipping bit is "the most famous scene ever 
shot for a film that was never made." Yes, well, that narrows it. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we learn that Monroe was "quietly rehired" after being fired -- a 
fascinating scoop for the minuscule minority who knew this production even 
existed, let alone that she was fired from it. 
</P>
<P>
The more central question -- "What exactly was the matter with Marilyn Monroe?" 
-- is asked by Schipper, but never answered. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sunday's two-hour Sinatra program (9 p.m., Channels 2 and 8) not 
only doesn't answer questions, it doesn't even ask any. At least that's the 
impression gotten from an hour of excerpts provided by CBS in lieu of the 
entire program being completed. 
</P>
<P>
"Sinatra 75: The Best Is Yet to Come" is a standing ovation for the greatest 
pop singer of our time, with executive producers George Schlatter and Tina 
Sinatra (Frank's youngest daughter) appearing to operate only on the sunny side 
of the street. 
</P>
<P>
This highly selective approach would be acceptable were not the producers 
attempting also to turn this into a biography of Sinatra the man in addition to 
a celebration of his music and acting career. 
</P>
<P>
As for Sinatra the performer, there's footage of him and 72-year-old Ella 
Fitzgerald singing "The Lady Is a Tramp" at a recent musical tribute to him in 
Los Angeles. When it comes to sheer energy and presence, it's amazing how much 
each can still deliver. 
</P>
<P>
It's the retrospective of his career that provides a real rush, however. This 
includes his movie musicals with Gene Kelly, for example, but also a memorable 
black-and-white clip of Sinatra and Elvis Presley singing "Witchcraft" on TV in 
1960, a sequence showing the playfulness of a young Elvis. How many times will 
you ever see Sinatra upstaged? 
</P>
<P>
As for Sinatra the man, the obligatory star tributes surface, along with a 
review of his life narrated by Robert Wagner and a visit with Sinatra at home 
talking about his painting and doting on his dogs: "Hello, pretty puppy dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Hello, puffery. Based on the excerpts made available by CBS, this appears to be 
an incomplete picture heavy on flattery, and you sort of wish "Sinatra 75" had 
hit the highlights of his epic music and movies and left it at that instead of 
trying to sell him as lovable Mr. Goodwrench. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrities fill the screen, making us think we know everything about them when 
actually we know very little. That's witchcraft for you.

<P>
Recently, I was reading an etiquette book that was written in the early 1960s. 
Besides addressing the gaucherie of smoking a cigar anywhere other than City 
Hall, the book devoted a lengthy chapter on how to drink responsibly at 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
Doing the cha-cha on the host's coffee table or spilling Drambuie on the 
off-white carpet was about as faux pas as you could get. Otherwise, the rules 
were fairly simple. 
</P>
<P>
Guests at early 1960s holiday parties were responsible for gauging how merry 
they were becoming after their fourth Chelsea Sidecar. Hosts were responsible 
for providing hot coffee before turning their drinking guests out onto the 
highways and byways. 
</P>
<P>
This party scenario of letting the corn doodles fall where they may and having 
another one for the road drives people like Cynthia Roark mad. Roark, a 
Fallbrook resident whose school-age daughter was killed by a drunk driver, is 
the San Diego County chapter president of the 3,000-member Mothers Against 
Drunk Drivers. She wants to make the phrase "designated driver" more 
commonplace than "three-martini lunch." 
</P>
<P>
"Our issue is not alcohol, it's driving while under the influence of alcohol," 
Roark said. "We want everyone to get home safely, we don't want people on the 
road endangering their lives, much less the lives of other people." 
</P>
<P>
To this end, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers has launched a holiday public 
awareness campaign that includes a children's poster contest and the 
distribution of red ribbons to be tied around car antennas as a symbol of the 
driver's commitment to drive sober. 
</P>
<P>
Roark says there are several things that hosts of holiday parties can do to 
ensure that guests have a good time and make it home safely. 
</P>
<P>
"Hosts should plan alternatives to alcoholic beverages, offer a big array of 
nonalcoholic beverages," Roark said. "We also encourage people who host parties 
to serve foods that are not high in salt content so it causes someone to drink 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Other party tips include having someone play the role of bartender rather than 
have the alcohol free flowing, and to stop serving alcohol an hour before the 
party's end, Roark said. But most important is for the host to encourage her 
guests, when she is inviting them, to arrange for a designated driver. 
</P>
<P>
"We call a designated driver, a sober driver, the life insurance of a party," 
Roark said. "Pre-planning is the best way to a party so everyone is comfortable 
and the guests' needs are met." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone interested in obtaining more information from Mothers Against Drunk 
Drivers can write 510 N. Escondido Blvd., Suite 2B, Escondido 92025. The phone 
number is 746-6233. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, from Thanksgiving to New Year's Day, there were two deaths related 
to drunk driving on North County freeways, said John Marinez, a California 
Highway Patrol spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
All together in 1989, 60 people died on North County freeways as a result of 
drunk driving, according to the CHP. Nine of those fatalities were drunk 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
There were 2,019 arrests for drunk driving that year -- 64 at Thanksgiving; 35 
on Christmas Eve/Day; 33 on New Year's Eve/Day. 
</P>
<P>
This year in California there have been several significant changes in the 
drunk driving laws, most notably the new, lower blood alcohol level of .08% as 
the legal limit. 
</P>
<P>
Under this new law, put into effect Jan. 1, there were 16% more drivers 
arrested in Southern California for drunk driving on state highways, and 10% 
more drivers were convicted of the crime during the first 10 months of this 
year than during the same period in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Another new state law enacted in July, called the Admin Per Se Law, gives 
police and CHP the authority to take away a person's driver's license 
immediately if their blood alcohol level is .10% or higher, Marinez said. The 
officer can issue a temporary driver's license good for 90 days, but if a drunk 
driver is found guilty in court, he could have his license suspended for six 
months or longer, depending on the circumstances, Marinez said. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to eliminate the death toll and nab as many offenders as possible, 
the CHP is beefing up its presence for the days surrounding Christmas and New 
Year's, said Jerry Bohrer of the CHP's Oceanside office. Starting at 6 p.m. the 
Friday before these two Tuesday holidays, officers will work extended shifts to 
ensure more ground is covered, he said. A sobriety checkpoint, most likely in 
Oceanside, is also going to be enacted sometime during the remaining weeks of 
the holiday season, Bohrer said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the quick release program, which enables a drunk driver to be released to 
a sober adult after paying a fine, will be suspended before Christmas and New 
Years. Anyone arrested can expect to spend a minimum of 24 hours in jail, but 
more likely could serve up to four days jail time, Marinez said. 
</P>
<P>
"With the quick release suspended, everyone stays in jail for the duration," he 
said. "This year, if you're arrested on a Friday (before a holiday), you'll 
probably be spending Christmas or New Year's in a drunk tank, and those can get 
real crowded, especially on holidays." 
</P>
<P>
Consider, also, the economic mess of getting arrested for drunk driving. It 
costs $1,000 to bail out of a San Diego County jail after being arrested on a 
driving under the influence charge. 
</P>
<P>
Procedure also calls for the drunk driver's vehicle to be towed at the owner's 
expense. Add to this the vehicle storage charge while the the person is cooling 
his or her heels in the drunk tank, and there goes the Christmas club savings.

MORE THAN JUST A BIT OF COLOR

<P>
North County is at the vortex of a seasonal exchange of flora between warm and 
cold climates: we send flowers, they send trees. 
</P>
<P>
In places where snow shovels and mufflers are necessary accessories, folks pine 
for the fresh flowers and colorful plants that grow in North County. Ranches 
and greenhouses in Encinitas and Carlsbad produce cut flowers and flowering 
plants that will add brilliant holiday color to homes and workplaces around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, stately Noble and Douglas firs make their way south from Washington 
and Oregon to be adorned with lights and baubles in Poway and Del Mar. Although 
some pines are grown locally, the majority are imported, usually from the 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
In North County, where holidays can be spent at the beach or riding bikes and 
where Santa is likely to be wearing Raybans, folks often use imported decor to 
remind themselves that Christmas is coming and the goose is getting fat. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more people are decorating for the holiday season," said Karen 
England of Sunshine Gardens in Encinitas. "They seem to want the traditional 
types of decorations like you'd see in a magazine -- wreaths on doors or over 
mantles, centerpieces, holiday bouquets. To get that holiday aroma in the 
house, they'll put fresh garland (long strands of woven pine boughs) along 
staircases or over doorways." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest impact on the holiday season, though, comes from the sprawling, 
900-acre Paul Ecke Poinsettia Ranch in Encinitas. More than 90% of the world's 
flowering poinsettia plants get their start there as 3/4-inch cuttings, which 
are shipped around the globe as mother plants. 
</P>
<P>
The poinsettia, with its distinctive green under-foliage and brightly colored 
(usually red) leaves, has become the nation's best-selling plant (surpassing 
chrysanthemums, the longtime leader) and has, for many, become the new living 
symbol of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Individual consumers can't buy directly from the Ecke ranch, but when they buy 
from other outlets in the area they are usually getting an Ecke-cultivated 
plant. It is something that most sellers point out with pride. Poinsettias are 
priced from under $5 to more than $60. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional red poinsettias are still the most popular, but selective breeding 
on the Ecke Ranch has produced many shades of pink, white and yellow, as well 
as variegated pink and white and, this year's hybrid special, a speckled 
cultivar with pink flecks on dark red bracts called "Jingle Bells." 
</P>
<P>
"Poinsettias are the Christmas flower," said Evelyn Weidner of Weidner's 
Begonia Gardens in Encinitas, which sells Ecke plants. "It's not Christmas 
until you have a poinsettia. They make wonderful gifts and now they stay in 
bloom for months. They just make people feel like Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Recently named San Diego County Farmer of the Year, Weidner owns four ranches 
in Encinitas that ship flowering plants from Hawaii to Maine. At one ranch, 
used strictly for propagation, new and unusual plants are developed for 
shipping to growers across the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
One of the newest is scaevola, or "Blue Wonder," a German import that is 
propagated in the United States only at Weidner's. Other current favorites at 
the Weidner ranches and Begonia Garden are lysimashia procumbes, or "Golden 
Globes," and acalypha pendula, or "Strawberry Firetails," a showy flower from 
South and Central America that can be grown as a ground cover or in hanging 
baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are able to dig up their own begonias when in season, and, at this 
time of year, can dig up pansies, a winter color plant that can be kept in 
bloom till the hot summer months. "We have a lot of cyclamen, and those are 
plants that bloom well into the winter and keep blooming till spring and almost 
summer. They're just gorgeous," Weidner said. 
</P>
<P>
"This time of year, it's such a flash of color that you can't resist," said 
Weidner's daughter, Mary. That flash of color includes fuchsias, impatiens, 
diascias and anthuriums as well as poinsettias. Weidner's offers topiary 
classes and informal workshops for poinsettia decorating and holiday ideas. It 
also has orchids and blue and white baskets for Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
Another major grower in North County, Thornton-Blue Pacific in Encinitas, 
raises more than 70 different kinds of flowers that are shipped around the 
world as cut blooms. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the largest bird of paradise grower in the world," said Joe Leiva, 
sales manager. "We ship them all across the United States, Canada and Puerto 
Rico." The ranch has 65 acres of bird of paradise, which along with snap 
dragons, poms and miscellaneous brightly colored "wax" or shiny flowers, are 
holiday favorites. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 50 flower growers in the Encinitas area alone. December 
actually marks the start of the cut flower season, which extends to Valentine's 
Day, Mother's Day, Easter and June weddings. As springtime holidays approach, 
roses and carnations move ahead in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the poinsettia is in its finest hour.

MARADONA DESIRES TO LEAVE ITALY;

<P>
Diego Maradona, the Argentine soccer star who has led Napoli to two Italian 
League soccer titles, said Wednesday that he wants to leave Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no other choice," he wrote in a column carrying his byline in the daily 
newspaper Il Roma. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona, 30, has been embroiled in several controversies this year. He was 
benched for last Sunday's game against Atalanta in Bergamo after skipping 
practice several times. He described the decision by Napoli Coach Alberto Bigon 
as "the straw that broke the camel's back." 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't know if Bigon will include me in the lineup for Sunday's match 
against Lazio," Maradona wrote. "He probably prefers to field those who train 
six days a week, but who have not given Napoli what I have given so far." 
</P>
<P>
Maradona, who came to Napoli in 1984 from Barcelona of Spain for a then-record 
$10 million transfer fee, last year reported one month late to the team's 
preseason training camp. 
</P>
<P>
In November, he initially refused to travel to the Soviet Union for a 
second-round European Champions Cup game, but, after fan protests and a 
club-threatened suspension, flew to Moscow by private plane. 
</P>
<P>
Napoli sued Maradona earlier this month, saying his recent behavior had damaged 
the club's image. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Vatican daily newspaper l'Osservatore Romano, in a rare 
commentary on sports figures, criticized Maradona's recent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Under the headline "The Sunset of a Star," the paper wrote: "Maradona has not 
understood that humility and discretion in the private life of a champion are 
as important as scoring a beautiful goal. . . . In soccer, intelligent players 
count less than ill-bred stars."

MARTIN BREAKS FREE IN FOURTH QUARTER, RALLIES OCEAN VIEW

<P>
Guard Ryan Martin sparked a fourth-quarter rally that gave Ocean View High 
School a 79-76 victory over Lakewood Wednesday night in the second round of the 
Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
Martin scored 11 of his 20 points in the final quarter, including a three-point 
shot with 1:23 remaining that pushed Ocean View ahead, 75-74. Forty-three 
seconds later, Martin made a driving bank shot that increased the lead to 
77-74. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (5-1) fought an uphill battle in a physical game after missing its 
first seven shots. The Seahawks didn't take their first lead until 6:37 left to 
play when Martin scored on a layup for a 61-60 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Martin had been contained for three quarters by Lakewood's Mike Fields. But 
Fields wasn't a factor in the decisive fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
When Lakewood Coach Tim Sweeney was asked why he took Fields off Martin in the 
fourth quarter, the coach said, "Fields took himself off Martin, I didn't. He 
stopped guarding him." 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Ocean View made all eight of its field-goal attempts and 
10 of 13 free throws. Center Marcel TenBerge, who was double-teamed most of the 
game, led all scorers with 28 points, making 11 of 20 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve forward Marc Sessions came off the bench to hit two three-point shots 
for Ocean View and added 10 points. Afterward, Ocean View Coach Jim Harris 
called the game "incredibly physical." 
</P>
<P>
"We had to fight our way back, literally," Harris said. "This was a good win, 
particularly after the position we put ourselves into to open the second half 
(trailing, 41-30)." 
</P>
<P>
In another quarterfinal: 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei 68, St. Monica 41 -- J.J. Ballesteros scored 15 points to lead Mater 
Dei. 
</P>
<P>
In consolation play: 
</P>
<P>
Servite 67, Bosco Tech 35 -- The Friars (6-1) took a 7-0 lead and never looked 
back, rebounding from a last-second loss in the first round. Forward Adam 
Anderson scored 16 points in three quarters, making six of 10 shots and all 
four of his free-throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"I was anxious to see how we would react after a tough loss, and I thought we 
played very hard defensively in the first half," said Richard Smith, Servite 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Servite, which forced Bosco Tech (1-3) into 28 turnovers with a trapping press, 
made 21 of 43 shots in three quarters before Smith emptied his bench. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood 101, Loara 81 -- Guard Tes Whitlock of Loara hit only 13 of 33 shots. 
Whitlock did make five of six three-point shots in the fourth quarter to finish 
with 41 points for the Saxons (2-3).

Cherokee Parks scored 34 points and pulled down 15 rebounds, but Marina High

Jordan Wednesday night at Marina.

<P>
Parks had 10 points in the fourth quarter when the Vikings (3-3) cut a 15-point 
deficit to four, 55-51, with 11 seconds left. Rodney Harris hit the front end 
of a one-and-one with nine seconds left to seal the victory for Jordan (5-3).

NORTHRIDGE COMEBACK FALLS SHORT AS CS LONG BEACH PREVAILS, 88-73 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After yet another loss, Cal State Northridge cannot be blamed for looking for 
moral victories. In its 88-73 loss to Cal State Long Beach on Wednesday night, 
it found a silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN (1-6) not only held a team under 90 points for the first time all season, 
it put together the best second-half comeback of its season. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the surges against Montana and Montana State -- where CSUN cut the 
deficit from 28 points to within 14, but no closer -- the Matadors pulled 
within three before the host 49ers pulled away for their second win against 
four losses. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-4 spurt started with a layup by freshman Andre Chevalier, pulled into 
high gear when Chevalier set up Keith Gibbs for a reverse dunk, maintained 
momentum with consecutive baskets by Shelton Boykin, continued with a steal and 
10-foot bank shot by David Swanson and ended when Gibbs nailed a three-point 
basket off a steal by Chevalier. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg was throwing his suit coat into the 
bleachers and chewing his players up one side and down the other. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Northridge fans, the tirade had the desired effect. The 49ers 
scored seven points in a row and outscored CSUN, 21-4, in a seven-minute span 
that ended with the Matadors trailing, 76-57. 
</P>
<P>
"We allowed some penetration which was the big thing we told 'em not to 
permit," CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy said. "Lucious Harris is awful good at that 
and they are so physical, they have amazing size and quickness. We also had a 
touch of panic there with the press and that shouldn't have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a former Cleveland High star, scored two of his game-high 25 points and 
handed out three of his five assists immediately after the Matadors closed the 
gap. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out slow and they jumped out on us," Harris said. "I was scared. We 
had to get back out there and work." 
</P>
<P>
Although the rally earned CSUN a measure of respect, Gibbs is weary of the 
Matadors' inability to maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me more frustrated to have a streak like that and not be able to hold 
onto it," he said. "That streak showed us we can play, but we have to do that 
the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Chevalier, whose defense helped key the streak, earned the praise of his former 
Cleveland High Coach Bobby Braswell, now a 49ers assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
"It is good to see him -- I can say it now -- play that well," Braswell said. 
"He played great defense, he put some pressure on some people. He always had 
the biggest heart. He has no fear, he took charges from some 6-8 and 6-9 guys 
and he's only 5-8, you know." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-8 and 6-9 guys caused problems nonetheless. Frankie Edwards scored 15 
points and Bryon Russell had 14. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN, which has pressed all season, abandoned the press because of the 49ers 
quickness, but Long Beach used it after made baskets and forced seven 
first-half turnovers with it. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge also was whistled for four traveling violations and an out-of-bounds 
violation.

Robby Cook: Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
Wrestling: 142 pounds 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore: 5-foot-7 
</P>
<P>
The technical term for the move is a lateral drop, but in layman's language, 
Robby Cook's takedown in the waning seconds of his semifinal match was simply 
an enormous turnaround for Moorpark College's wrestling team in last week's 
state junior college championships. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 10-5, with seven seconds remaining, Cook took Fresno City's Ralph 
Olivas down for two points and then segued into a three-point near-fall to tie 
the score before time expired. 
</P>
<P>
Cook won, 12-10, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the Hail Mary throw," Moorpark Coach John Keever said. "There's no 
question it won the state meet for us." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark and Fresno were battling for the team lead at the time, and Keever 
estimated that Cook's win provided a 20-point turnaround. Cook went on to win 
the title at 142 pounds.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: NORTHRIDGE'S CHEVALIER MAKES A GOOD POINT IN A BACKCOURT 
START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andre Chevalier responded to his first start at point guard for Cal State 
Northridge with his best game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In a season-high 30 minutes against Montana State on Saturday, the freshman 
from Cleveland High scored nine points, dished out six assists and made six 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
Chevalier's presence allowed Keith Gibbs to move from point guard to small 
forward and score a team-high 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-8 Chevalier is a quick study. He went from throwing up an air ball 
in the opener against Colorado and making two turnovers in three minutes 
against Colorado State to scoring 10 points against Northern Arizona and coming 
within a steal of tying the school record in the Montana State game. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I wasn't into it mentally," Chevalier said. "I had the freshmen 
jitters." 
</P>
<P>
Chevalier's chief concern is cutting down on his average of 4.5 turnovers a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"It is nerves and lack of experience," said CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy. 
"Decision-making is critical and it gets more difficult in the up-tempo game. 
He is coming along, though. You can always rely on him to go hard. He is 
feisty." 
</P>
<P>
Chevalier is such a competitor that few would notice that he was born with a 
deformed left hand. He also is almost legally blind in his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in the (CSUN equipment room) didn't know until yesterday," said 
Chevalier of his hand. "It doesn't affect my shooting at all, but I do have to 
concentrate a little harder when I dribble." 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate indignity: Nothing went right for the Matadors in their 104-78 
loss to Montana State. They even incurred the wrath of the officiating crew. 
</P>
<P>
After warning the Matadors that they were taking too long during timeouts, an 
official put the ball down on the floor and started counting to five, forcing 
CSUN to inbound the ball hurriedly. 
</P>
<P>
But that was only the beginning. After the next timeout, the official allowed 
Montana State to inbound the ball while the Matadors were still in the huddle. 
The Bobcats scored on an uncontested layup. 
</P>
<P>
First impressions: It is fortunate that Keith Gibbs and David Keeter don't let 
first impressions last. The first time they met, on opposite sides of a state 
community college quarterfinal playoff game last March, they went after each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"We almost got into a fight," said Keeter, who was playing for El Camino 
College. "We were throwing elbows and talking trash. The refs had to break it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Following the final buzzer, a 97-90 win by Keeter's El Camino team over Gibbs' 
West Valley team, the pair shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, they were CSUN teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Injury update: Jason Webster, the second-leading scorer on The Master's 
basketball team, will miss two to three weeks with a sprained left ankle he 
sustained last week in a loss to San Francisco State. 
</P>
<P>
Newest Aggies: When New Mexico State signed Antelope Valley's Tony Madison and 
Moorpark's Sam Crawford, the Aggies got the long and the short of Valley-area 
junior college guards. 
</P>
<P>
Madison is a long-bombing gunner whose shooting range extends well beyond the 
three-point line, and the 5-foot-7 Crawford, though short in stature, has 
engendered high hopes at New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing everybody asks about Sam is his size. What we've got to 
explain about Sam is that he'll be fine despite his size," said Gar Forman, a 
New Mexico State assistant in charge of recruiting. "He's one of the best 
passers I've seen in a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Randy Brown, New Mexico State's starting point guard, is in his final season of 
eligibility, and Forman said the team has struggled with outside shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to Sam to run our point, and we're looking to Tony to shoot it," 
Forman said. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford's signing has also evoked memories of another diminutive New Mexico 
State star, 5-foot-8 Charlie Criss, who helped the Aggies reach the NCAA Final 
Four in 1970 and played professionally for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Two for five: In the five years the Harlon Hill Trophy has been awarded to the 
top football player in NCAA Division II, only two schools have winners. 
Northridge isn't one of them. Tailback Albert Fann, the Matadors' latest 
nominee, finished fourth in the voting this season. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;I's Johnny Bailey won from 1987-89, North Dakota State's Jeff 
Bentrim won in 1986 and quarterback Chris Simdorn this season became that 
school's second winner. 
</P>
<P>
Simdorn, who guided North Dakota State to a national championship, got 29 
first-place votes, 11 seconds and 14 thirds. Fann got eight first-place votes, 
eight seconds and 18 thirds. 
</P>
<P>
Edinboro (Pa.) wide receiver Ernie Priester was second in the voting, followed 
by Mississippi College tailback Fred McAfee. 
</P>
<P>
Statwatch: The Antelope Valley women's basketball team set a school single-game 
scoring record Monday night with 110 points against Victor Valley. Six players 
scored in double figures. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tony Williams, Ventura College freshman running back, finished with a 
school-record 943 rushing yards. He was given the outstanding back award at the 
team's recent banquet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley's J.R. Rider had five dunks in the first half Monday night 
against Victor Valley as UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian watched. 
</P>
<P>
Record rewrite: Tailback Steve Miller, tight end Thomas Reimer, wide receiver 
David Brown, and quarterback Marty Washington of Antelope Valley all moved into 
the top 10 on various Marauder football lists this season. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a sophomore, gained 804 yards to bring his two-year career total to 
1,251 yards, 10th on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
Reimer, a freshman from Quartz Hill High, had 30 receptions for 536 yards and 
three touchdowns to move to third on the single-season reception list, and 
Brown, another freshman, moved to sixth with 26 receptions for 386 yards and 
four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, a redshirt freshman from Quartz Hill, set a single-season record 
for passing yardage with 1,448 yards, completing 101 of 234 passes for 13 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The defense, led by cornerback John Johnson's nine interceptions, picked off 24 
passes this season, one short of the school record.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Cal State Northridge football player was ordered Wednesday to stand trial on 
felony charges that he had an unloaded shotgun at a campus apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Boulden, 20, is scheduled to answer to one count of possession of a firearm 
on public school grounds Dec. 26 in San Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the reserve linebacker faces a maximum sentence of three years in 
state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Boulden was arrested Nov. 28 at the University Park apartments after campus 
police found the weapon in his room, according to testimony Tuesday in his 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Donald Barnett said campus police went to Boulden's apartment after 
other residents in the complex reported seeing a man carrying a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Boulden is free on $5,000 bail. AARON CURTISS

ART BREATHES LIFE INTO 'CHRISTMAS MEMORY'

<TEXT>
<P>
Love seen through a prism of nostalgic reverie creates the beauty of Truman 
Capote's "A Christmas Memory." It's a wonderfully sentimental story that not 
only basks in the essence of the season but reminds us of what an affecting 
writer Capote could be, before the caricature of his personality obscured his 
talents. 
</P>
<P>
There's admiration in the Alternative Repertory Theatre's reading of "A 
Christmas Memory," an appreciation of the written and spoken word that spirits 
the imagination in all of us. It's this fondness that makes the experience at 
the tiny playhouse so touching. 
</P>
<P>
ART, a symbol of pluck on the Orange County theater scene if ever there was 
one, has often been knocked for failing to vivify the usually difficult plays 
it takes on, but that can't be applied here. 
</P>
<P>
Under Joel Cotter's deft direction, Barbara Sorenson and Lee Clark personify 
the simple humanity of Capote's story in pure ways. 
</P>
<P>
Clark is Buddy (the 7-year-old Truman) and Sorenson is a cousin in her 60s. 
Black sheep in a distracted, strait-laced family, they find joy and comfort 
when together. Their love justifies each other, especially during Christmas as 
they go about a fruitcake ritual, making then mailing them to presidents, 
postmen, strangers -- anybody who has struck their fancy during the year. 
</P>
<P>
Capote's language is dear, delicate and without a trace of cynicism as he 
covers the mundane but illuminated events of the day. It's a tale for children 
as well as adults: youngsters will enjoy the images of flying kites, ogre-like 
moonshiners and small-frame Christmas glory; their parents will enjoy the 
intimacy of the emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Before "A Christmas Memory," the troupe offers readings from six other 
holiday-oriented stories. 
</P>
<P>
It's a welcome potpourri that veers from the arch sentimentality of O. Henry's 
"Gift of the Magi" to "The Indian Giver," Steve Martin's parody of it. We also 
hear from Dickens' ("Happy Happy Christmas"), Clement Clarke Moore (that old 
chestnut "Visit From St. Nick"), Jonathan Winters ("The Snowman") and Jerry 
Gordon (the finger-snapping beatnik ode, "A Tomato Colored Headband"). 
</P>
<P>
As with "A Christmas Memory," the actors (Amy Larson, Gary Christensen and 
Clark) enliven the experience for us. You can feel good about this program, on 
all levels. 
</P>
<P>
Even the ticket price is appropriate -- your choice of toy donations for 
children, non-perishable foods for the homeless or any spare cash you might 
have to help out this always struggling theater. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A CHRISTMAS MEMORY' 
</P>

holiday tales. Directed by Joel Cotter. With Barbara Sorenson, Lee Clark, Amy

POP BEAT: HOLIDAY BENEFIT FOR THE NEEDY IS FORCED TO FOLD; 
</P>
<P>
THE SHOW'S ORGANIZER FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS COULD NOT RUN THE EVENT LONG 
DISTANCE, BUT OTHER EVENTS WILL GO ON.

<P>
As usual, Orange County rock musicians will play a raft of holiday charity 
shows, with five benefit concerts scheduled in the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County Music for the Needy, the most ambitious of the annual 
benefits, at least in scope, will not be staged again. 
</P>
<P>
"It really makes me feel bad," said Jim Palmer, the music entrepreneur who had 
been the driving force behind Music for the Needy during its 5-year run. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer moved to Las Vegas in 1989, ending a close association with the local 
alternative-rock scene as a concert promoter and booking agent. One of his main 
contributions was Music for the Needy. The daylong show's charitable goal was 
to raise money to provide a festive Christmas for poor families. Its other aim 
was to serve as a showcase and a community-building social event for the local 
rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer kept the benefit going last year, even though he had already moved to a 
new job as a promoter and booker at Calamity Jane's, a Las Vegas rock club. 
Palmer said over the phone last week that there was no way for him to keep 
Music for the Needy going long distance. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that maybe somebody would want to pick up the ball and do it," 
Palmer said. "If my job here wasn't so crazy, I'd be down there doing it. I 
just don't have the time now." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Lanni, who had helped Palmer plan past Music for the Needy shows and served 
as master of ceremonies, said his own time has been stretched between a regular 
job and managing three bands -- Don't Mean Maybe, the Clints and Bazooka. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad that it's not going to happen, but it would have been complete 
insanity for me to take on something like that," Lanni said. 
</P>
<P>
"The benefit did serve a purpose, where all these bands got together and 
everybody felt like a family for a day, I guess," said David Hansen, vice 
president of Dr. Dream Records. "With Jim and people like Sam Lanni, there was 
some sense of a community. But I don't feel that sense of any sort of a scene 
or community (among Orange County rock musicians) anymore. There's a few bands, 
(each) doing their (own) thing." 
</P>
<P>
One place that does try to cultivate an identity as a drop-in social center for 
local rock musicians is the Doll Hut, a little corner bar in Anaheim. The club 
will be throwing its annual Noise for Toys party Dec. 22-23. 
</P>
<P>
Noise for Toys is in its seventh year. It began, founder John Mello recalled, 
when he and some musician friends were hanging out at the Commonwealth Pub in 
Fullerton, downing beers while a group called the Gall Stones (which soon 
turned into the excellent, now-defunct Pontiac Brothers) knocked out Rolling 
Stones covers. The Gall Stones were getting free beers for their efforts; Mello 
and his friends figured that free drinks were a pretty good perk, so they would 
also get a band together to play the Pub. It was Christmastime so, dubbing 
themselves the Decadent Debutantes, they decided to make the show a children's 
benefit. The tradition has continued every year since. 
</P>
<P>
Mello doesn't have to sing for his beer anymore: He and his wife, Linda, are 
now owners of the Doll Hut. But the Debutantes continue to come out once a 
year, with an irregular lineup featuring singer-producer Mello and assorted 
friends. This year, the Decadent Debutantes will be one of 20 bands playing 
half-hour sets over the two nights of Noise for Toys. The shows will run from 
6:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup on Dec. 22 is to feature, in order of appearance, Mood Ring, the Ace 
Tones, Idle Hands, the Earwigs, Nervous Touch, Nevada Time, the Decadent 
Debutantes, Blind Hatred, Mother Fist and the Squids. Crawdaddy is to open the 
bill on Dec. 23, followed by the Clints, Derailed, Three Ring Binder, 
Newcastle, Rhythm 'n' Booze, Smash Palace, Rikk Agnew's Turtle, Groove Pusher 
and, at 1:15 a.m., a closing jam featuring surprise guests. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $5 or a new, unwrapped toy. Proceeds will go to the Canyon Acres 
Home for Abused Children. Mello said last year's Noise for Toys collected or 
bought $2,500 in toys for abused children who live at the Anaheim Hills 
residence; he's hoping to double that this year. Information: (714) 533-1286. 
</P>
<P>
Local reggae musicians will put on their third annual Christmas fund-raiser to 
donate toys to the Orangewood Children's Home for abused children and the Los 
Angeles Mission. Heading Sunday's bill is StrangeJah Cole who, under the name 
Stranger Cole, scored hits on the Jamaican ska scene in the 1960s. Now living 
in Laguna Hills, Cole will perform with his singing partner, Queen Rejoice, and 
the Club Motion Dancers. Also appearing are Jamaican singer Ras Michael and the 
Sons of Negus, led by the singer-drummer whose recording career dates back to 
1967. Also performing in the four-hour show are the Los Angeles-based band, 
Time, Effort &amp; Energy, plus Orange County's 714 Band. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the benefit raised $4,000 for toys, according to Queen Rejoice. With 
the event becoming more established, she said, the goal this year is to double 
that amount. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit begins at 6 p.m. at the Iglesia Community Center, 24671 Via 
Iglesia, Laguna Hills. Tickets: $8 for adults and $4 for children, with a $2 
discount for those also donating a new, unwrapped toy. Information: (714) 
458-6471. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Medley will sing to help Orange County homeless in a benefit Monday at the 
Righteous Brothers' Hop, 18774 Brookhurst St., Fountain Valley. Proceeds will 
go to the Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter. The show is to start at 7:30 p.m., 
with a minimum donation of $20. Information: (714) 963-2366. 
</P>
<P>
Several local alternative-rock bands have organized an all-ages concert Sunday 
to benefit Share Our Selves, the Costa Mesa anti-poverty agency. Performing are 
Olive Lawn, the Costa Mesa 4, Cold Black Decaf, Mission Impossible and Flatbed, 
which features members of Big Drill Car and the Cadillac Tramps. The show 
starts at 6 p.m. at Mucho Munchies Rock'n Cantina, 2675 Irvine Ave., Newport 
Beach. The requested donation is three cans of food or three other 
non-perishable food items. Concert-goers may also donate new, unwrapped toys 
valued at $5 or more.

FOLK REVIVAL: Until about three years ago, touring traditional folk musicians 
used to set up once a month in Carolyn Russell's living room in Garden Grove 
and put on a show. Then city officials found out what was going on, declared it 
a zoning violation and stopped the music -- despite neighbors' assurance that 
the concerts were no bother. Now, Russell and some friends are hoping to get 
back into the folk business, although not in her own home. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, a folk musician herself, is promoting a concert Sunday at 4:30 p.m. by 
Ed Trickett, a Maryland-based singer, guitarist and hammered dulcimer player 
with a wide repertoire of traditional folk material. Trickett's credits include 
appearances on "A Prairie Home Companion." The concert will take place in the 
Anaheim Cultural Arts Center, a small auditorium at 931 N. Harbor Blvd. 
Admission is $8. Information: (714) 535-3059, or (714) 638-1466. 
</P>
<P>
Trickett was featured at one of Russell's house concerts several years ago. 
Earlier this year, Russell said, "he called and asked if we were doing (house) 
concerts. We were not, but we said we would definitely put a concert on for 
him" during his West Coast trip. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Trickett's concert will be a trial run for a possible series of 
traditional folk concerts at the Anaheim Cultural Arts Center. "If we could get 
60 people as a minimum, that would be a nice start," Russell said. With that 
many ticket buyers, she said, the promoters can afford to rent the hall and pay 
musicians "enough that we're not embarrassed to give it to a performer." 
</P>
<P>
THEM CHANGES: Local rock trio Don't Mean Maybe has a new drummer and soon will 
have a new address. Singer-guitarist Mark Andrea said the band, which records 
for Dr. Dream Records, plans to move to San Francisco early next year. There, 
Andrea and bassist John Hawthorne will link up with the new drummer, Ron Sloan. 
Sloan had played in the first lineup of Don't Mean Maybe before heading north 
for college three years ago, Andrea said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be on tour from February to June, then record again and go on 
tour again, so it doesn't really matter where we are" based, Andrea said. "It's 
not really relevant." 
</P>
<P>
No longer with the band is Jeff Fairbanks, who played drums and also sang and 
wrote some of Don't Mean Maybe's songs. Andrea said the split came last month 
after the band had finished its first national tour. "There's no real bad 
feelings, just a parting," Andrea said, attributing the split to musical 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
The Swamp Zombies, another Dr. Dream band, have switched personnel too, 
replacing guitarist Travis Agle with Ray Vogelzang. Josh Agle, Travis' brother, 
remains in the band, along with bassist Steve Jacobs and percussionist Dave 
Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Travis "got married and decided he'd do the domestic thing, like get a real 
job," Josh reported. The Swamp Zombies will play New Year's Eve at Bogart's 
Bohemian Cafe.

ACTIVISTS TO LAUNCH LAUNDRY SERVICE FOR PEOPLE WITH AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AIDS activists from Northeast Los Angeles and Hollywood plan to establish a 
free laundry service for people with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Aunt Bee's," expected to be in operation by January, would be only the second 
program of its kind in the country, organizers claim. The proposed operation is 
modeled after Auntie Helen's Fluff 'n' Fold, a nonprofit service in San Diego 
believed to be the only self-sufficient laundry service for people with AIDS or 
AIDS-related complex. 
</P>
<P>
Aunt Bee's most likely will operate from a rented building in Silver Lake or 
Hollywood, organizers said. Volunteers each week will pick up the laundry of 
about 500 men, women and children with AIDS, wash it at the building and return 
it for free, said Miki Jackson, a free-lance graphic artist and community 
activist who will serve as executive director. 
</P>
<P>
A thrift store at the front of the building, small fund-raisers and private 
donations will pay for the service, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as someone is healthy and well and able, they should do their own 
laundry and be responsible for their life," she said. "But when they are too 
challenged and too ill, we want to be there to do it for them." 
</P>
<P>
At least 3,450 people in Los Angeles County have AIDS, according to the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control. Many have more laundry needs because of night 
sweats, diarrhea and other problems associated with the disease, said Dr. 
Martin Finn, AIDS program medical director for the county's Department of 
Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
And although people with AIDS are encouraged to try to live a normal life at 
home, they may lose the energy or ability to do their laundry, Finn said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get down to it, it's pretty hard to live when you don't have your 
laundry cared for," Finn said. "The illness, and its various ramifications, 
results in the use of a tremendous amount of laundry, so I don't think one can 
underestimate how important it is to meet this need." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and several others -- including Morris Kight, a prominent gay activist 
who founded the Gay and Lesbian Services Center in Hollywood -- started 
planning the service in September after touring Auntie Helen's in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
That facility was founded in 1988 by Gary Cheatham, who quit his job as a 
computer analyst when he tested positive for the HIV virus, the precursor to 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Auntie Helen's operates out of a rented building and washes 1,400 loads each 
month for about 200 people, Cheatham said. A thrift store in front pays for 
about 75% of the operation's $12,500 monthly expenses, with biweekly yard sales 
and private donations making up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The operation's three trucks, eight washing machines and eight dryers were 
donated, Cheatham said. About 70 volunteers do the washing and delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Although some AIDS service groups have "buddy systems" in which a volunteer may 
wash clothing for an individual with AIDS, Auntie Helen's is believed to be the 
only self-supporting, citywide program in the country specifically dedicated to 
washing laundry, Cheatham said. 
</P>
<P>
The service also loans medical equipment, such as wheelchairs, and gives its 
clients clothing, linens and household goods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Los Angeles service will operate in nearly the same way -- it will 
wash laundry and eventually will provide medical equipment and clothing -- but 
it will require twice the number of washers and dryers to serve twice the 
number of people, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Aunt Bee's initially will serve about 500 people under the corporate umbrella 
of the U.S. Missions, a nonprofit shelter in Hollywood that feeds senior 
citizens and the homeless. Eventually, it will become an independent, nonprofit 
organization serving up to 1,000 people, Kight said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Missions already has donated office equipment and two businessmen donated 
$1,000. But organizers still are soliciting donations of washing machines, 
dryers and cars. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting in November drew support from gay and lesbian organizations, such as 
the Valley Business Alliance, ACT-UP and the Stonewall Democratic Club, and 
from several abortion-rights groups, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
The organizers want to have the service running by January. They have decided 
to send out an Aunt Bee's Christmas card to solicit donations and support. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's facility is widely considered a success, he said. A Los Angeles 
service probably will be more difficult to establish, Cheatham and Jackson 
agreed. San Diego has at least 900 residents living with AIDS, compared with 
Los Angeles' 3,450, federal statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
Also, most San Diego users of the service live in the area of the UC San Diego 
Medical Center, which has an AIDS clinic, but Los Angeles residents are spread 
throughout the county -- making pickup and delivery of clothing potentially 
more difficult, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
But organizers hope that the creation of Aunt Bee's will prompt creation of a 
network of smaller, community-based laundry services throughout the county, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The geography of Los Angeles means that one place is not going to be able to 
give the kind of good, prompt service we want to give to someone in Long Beach 
or Santa Monica," Jackson said.

MILNER SAYS HE WON'T SEEK 3RD COUNCIL TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying he had accomplished most of his key goals, Glendale City Councilman 
Jerold Milner announced Tuesday that he will not seek a third four-year term in 
the April 2 election. 
</P>
<P>
Milner, 60, said he agrees with the California voters who approved term limits 
for state officeholders in last month's election, although the measure does not 
apply to Glendale officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people of California have decided there should be an eight-year 
limit on how long people should serve," the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
Milner said he had accomplished the two major goals he set for himself when he 
was elected to the council: to control the city's growth and improve the city's 
redevelopment program. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman played a leading role in preparing the growth management program 
enacted recently to reduce the number of new apartments and condominiums that 
can be built in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Milner said the city faces several challenges "that would be lots of fun to 
address." He said the city must assist Glendale car dealers, whose expansion 
plans have been opposed by nearby residents, and address the problem of day 
laborers who congregate at two Glendale sites. Other unresolved issues, he 
said, include developing new design rules for single-family houses and 
providing more open space. 
</P>
<P>
But, Milner said, "I think the philosophy of limited service in office 
overrides the temptation to continue." 
</P>
<P>
He said his greatest disappointment was the council's failure earlier this year 
to approve an overnight on-street parking ban that was strongly opposed by 
residents. Milner said the parking restriction would have helped the city 
reduce the size of Glendale households, and he predicted that the council would 
reconsider the matter in the future. 
</P>
<P>
His announcement ended the uncertainty regarding the reelection plans of two 
council members whose seats are at stake in the spring election. The other, 
Mayor Larry Zarian, last week launched his campaign for a third term. 
</P>
<P>
Although nomination papers cannot be filed until January, two other candidates, 
Mary Ann Plumley and Eileen Hadley Givens, have already begun campaigning for 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
Milner, who said he does not plan to endorse anyone in the April race, said he 
is disappointed by the number of candidates. "I would like to see the people of 
Glendale have a choice among four or five business-oriented candidates," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman said he favors candidates with such a background because he 
considers the operation of the city a big business. 
</P>
<P>
Milner's announcement could trigger the entry of other candidates who were 
reluctant to challenge a well-known incumbent. When Councilman John F. Day 
decided not to seek reelection in 1979, 13 candidates filed and Glendale had 
its most widely contested campaign in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
Milner, a native of Boulder, Colo., who grew up in Cheyenne, Wyo., and San 
Carlos, Calif., has lived in Glendale for 27 years. In 1987, he retired after 
33 years as a manager with Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
He said he plans to remain active in civic organizations including the Glendale 
Kiwanis Club and the Glendale Symphony Assn. after he steps down from the 
council.

DEVELOPER OFFERS NEW PLAN FOR CONSIDERATION UNDER OLD RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an apparent turnabout, developer Ken Doty told Glendale City Council members 
Tuesday that he will consider scaling down his plan for a luxury subdivision 
off Sleepy Hollow Place if they will let him submit a new proposal before new 
regulations on hillside development are adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The council last week rejected by a 3-2 vote Doty's plan to build 25 
million-dollar houses, refusing to certify an environmental review of the plan. 
Members said they wanted to see fewer houses and less environmental damage on 
the 30-acre site in scenic Glenoaks Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Doty refused to specify the number of houses he had in mind, saying only that 
he will work with the council to draft an acceptable subdivision plan. Over the 
past year, he has consistently argued that it would not be feasible to build 
fewer than 25 houses. 
</P>
<P>
The Sleepy Hollow plan was one of four proposed projects exempted from an 
18-month ban on hillside development passed last March to allow officials to 
develop new rules covering grading, ridgeline preservation and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
Another proposal, a 12-house subdivision off Somerset Road in Chevy Chase 
Canyon, was narrowly rejected Monday by the city Planning Commission. It is 
expected to be reviewed by the council in January. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the ban would stop Doty from filing an alternative plan 
until revised rules are adopted and the ban is lifted in October. But last 
week, Councilman Jerold Milner asked the city staff to prepare a second 
exemption for Doty, arguing that it would be unfair to make the developer start 
over entirely with an alternative plan that conforms to new building 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members and City Atty. Scott H. Howard responded by drafting an exemption 
for all four projects, saying that making an exception only for Doty would 
leave the city on shaky legal ground. 
</P>
<P>
But Milner said Tuesday that he wanted only Doty to be able to submit an 
alternative plan before new hillside guidelines are adopted. He directed Howard 
and other city planners to draft an exception specifically for Doty. The matter 
will be presented to council members next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not interested in opening up the opportunity to the world that we put on 
hold when we instituted the moratorium," Milner said. But he said Doty's plan 
deserves particular attention because it has been in the planning process for a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
It was uncertain Tuesday whether council members will approve the exception. 
Carl Raggio said he was wary of giving special treatment to only one project, 
and Mayor Larry Zarian has said he would not approve such an exception until 
Doty presents a revised plan more suitable for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Jutras, who along with Milner voted last week to approve Doty's 
environmental review, and Ginger Bremberg, who voted against it, did not 
indicate their positions. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Glenoaks Canyon Homeowners Assn., which had urged the council to 
reject Doty's 25-house plan, said Tuesday that the developer should have to 
wait for new building guidelines "like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you've shown a good reason for a special exemption," Andrew 
Cervik, a resident of Edwards Place, told the council. The rejection of Doty's 
environmental review "will give him a chance to work with you to decide how 
this city will be developed." 
</P>
<P>
In a related move, council members voted not to approve a formal listing of 
their reasons for rejecting Doty's environmental review, saying that some 
clarification in wording was needed. The list will be revised and will return 
to the council next week for another vote.

COMMISSIONERS CITE FIRE, TRAFFIC PROBLEMS IN REJECTION OF CHEVY CHASE CANYON 
PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale Planning Commission, citing concerns about potential environmental 
damage, increased traffic and the risk of fires, this week narrowly rejected a 
plan to build a 12-house subdivision on a Chevy Chase Canyon hillside. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners voted 3 to 2 Monday against the proposal by developer Vahan 
Bezdikian to build the Somerset Estates housing tract on five acres of 
chaparral- and oak-covered land off Somerset Road. Bezdikian had agreed to 
dedicate the remaining six acres of his property as open space. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in no way trying to deny some development" on the site, said Ted Osborn, 
who with Commissioners Don Pearson and Claudia Rizzo Culling rejected the 
project. But Osborn said he would prefer "something that is smaller and more 
sensitive to the area, that accommodates improving . . . traffic and fire 
control, rather than adding to the problems that exist now." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners Gary Tobian and Robert McCormick voted in favor of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
City planners recommended approval of the proposed subdivision as long as the 
developer met 46 conditions, ranging from standard grades for driveways to the 
widening and improving of Somerset and other roads. 
</P>
<P>
Bezdikian will not revise his proposal before he presents it to the City 
Council in January, but at that time may consider scaling it down if city 
planners remove some of the more costly conditions they imposed, said Marlene 
Roth, a consultant to the developer. 
</P>
<P>
Roth, who called Monday's decision disappointing, said the proposed subdivision 
could have been much larger, but the developer was attempting to compromise 
with concerned Chevy Chase Canyon homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
But the decision was welcomed by a handful of canyon homeowners, who before the 
vote told commissioners that the subdivision would add too much traffic to 
their narrow and winding streets. They also argued that it could harm the 
canyon area adjacent to Somerset Road, which has been designated for "scenic 
area preservation" under the city's general plan. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Fire Capt. Chris Gray told the commissioners that the canyon's narrow 
streets make it difficult for fire trucks and equipment to protect houses now 
in the area. He recommended that the project be approved only if the developer 
agreed to widen and improve certain roads for Fire Department access.

GLENDALE HIGH PLAYERS, COACH SWEEP HONORS AFTER EXCELLENT SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
AWARDS: RUCKER, OCON, SHOEMAKER NAMED BACK, LINEMAN, COACH OF THE YEAR OVER 
THOSE FROM 11 OTHER AREA SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 23 players who make up the All-Glendale football team are culled from 12 
schools that play in eight leagues and seven divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The team, which features three juniors and one sophomore, was selected by Times 
sportswriters based on ballots from area coaches. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the area's diversity and the success of many of the teams in their 
respective divisions often made choosing a back, lineman and coach of the year 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Not this year. 
</P>
<P>
In a clean sweep for Glendale High, Pathon Rucker was selected back of the 
year, guard Albert Ocon was selected lineman of the year and Don Shoemaker was 
selected coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker, Ocon and Shoemaker will be honored with the backs, linemen and coaches 
of the year from 10 other areas at an awards breakfast Sunday at 8:30 a.m. at 
the Anaheim Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale won its first 10 games, including impressive victories over Muir, 
Pasadena and Arcadia, before losing to Camarillo in the first round of the 
Southern Section Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale won its first Pacific League championship -- its first title since 
1980 when the Dynamiters played in the Foothill League -- and defeated 
defending Division II co-champion Muir for the first time in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Dynamiters outscored their opponents, 320-81. They averaged 355 yards a 
game and limited opponents to 173, recording shutouts against Bell-Jeff and 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have some athletes, it sure makes you look like a great coach," 
Shoemaker said. "A lot of people overlook the fact that these kids worked hard 
in the off-season." 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker also credits a staff that has been intact for his three seasons as 
head coach. It includes John Brinton (defensive coordinator), Dennis Ennis 
(defensive line), Kevin Grist (wide receivers and defensive backs), Peter 
Escalante (running backs and linebackers) and Richard Thomassian (offensive 
line). 
</P>
<P>
"The staff knows what we're trying to shoot for and the communication that 
creates is a definite plus," Shoemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker, who rushed for 901 yards and made the All-Glendale team last season as 
a sophomore, was one of the Southern Section's most dominant players. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker, a 5-foot-10, 180-pound junior, gained 1,878 yards and scored 29 
touchdowns. "What Pathon did didn't surprise me," Shoemaker said. "He was much 
stronger and faster this season and ran with so much more confidence. What 
surpassed our expectations was the offensive line, which allowed him to do so 
much more." 
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of the Dynamiters' offensive front was Ocon, a three-time 
All-Pacific League guard who trimmed down from 280 to 260 pounds this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing the 20 pounds significantly increased his effectiveness," Shoemaker 
said. "Albert was like a quarterback on the line of scrimmage. If the center or 
someone else missed his block, Albert was going to let him know about it." 
</P>
<P>
The good news for Glendale opponents is that Ocon is graduating. The bad news 
is that he's the only lineman the Dynamiters lose. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some excellent athletes at the skill and linemen positions coming up," 
Shoemaker said. "We're as excited about next year as we were about this year, 
maybe more."

rain-forest activist Chico Mendes, bringing a surprising end to the opening 
session of a closely watched murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
Darci Alves Pereira stunned a packed courtroom by admitting he shot Mendes on 
Dec. 22, 1988, shortly after dark outside his home in this remote Amazon town 
near the Bolivian border, 2,650 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
Pereira's confession came minutes after he had twice denied shooting Mendes, 
who was one of Brazil's most outspoken critics of development of the Amazon 
basin. Mendes' case has reached such proportions that film producers and 
authors have besieged his widow with competing offers to tell his story. 
</P>
<P>
Pereira, whose father also is charged with plotting the murder, faces a 12- to 
30-year sentence. Sentencing is expected today. 
</P>
<P>
The trial has drawn worldwide attention as a test of Brazil's commitment to 
protecting its rain forests against encroachment and to meting out equal 
justice for rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
Mendes, who defended the rain forest from landowners and ranchers who want to 
cut it down to develop the fragile basin, has become a symbol of Brazil's poor 
and landless. 
</P>
<P>
Ilzamar Mendes, widow of the activist, was sitting in the gallery when the 
confession occurred. She clapped her hands in surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"He confessed?" she asked incredulously. "It's hard to believe." She added, 
"He's probably doing it to protect his father." 
</P>
<P>
Pereira's father, rancher Darly Alves da Silva, also is on trial on charges of 
planning the shooting. He has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Mendes had repeatedly told police that Da Silva was plotting to kill him, after 
rubber tappers prevented the rancher from clearing a tract of rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
The trial began at 9 a.m. A boy picked the names of seven jurors out of a hat 
containing 21 slips of paper with local residents' names on them. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, two dozen state police troopers in army camouflage pants and 
bulletproof vests stood guard with submachine guns and pistols. Officials 
feared violence between rubber tappers and gunmen reportedly hired by ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
Da Silva, 54, wearing an unbuttoned blue shirt, slacks and thick glasses, was 
called to the bench. He denied accusations he had plotted Mendes' death and had 
ordered his son to carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
Then Pereira approached the bench and also denied the murder charge against 
him. He claimed he was in another town when Mendes was killed. 
</P>
<P>
The short, muscular Pereira was shown evidence found by police near where 
Mendes' killer hid: a 16-gauge shotgun, a black nylon raincoat, a burlap sack, 
two bottles and cigarette packs. Asked if he recognized the items, Pereira 
shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as bailiffs were leading Pereira from the courtroom, Judge Adair Longhini 
leaned over the bench and asked once again if the defendant had committed the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
Pereira paused, stared at Longhini and said, "I confess." 
</P>
<P>
"What?" said the judge. "You killed Chico Mendes?" 
</P>
<P>
"I shot him, yes," Pereira said.

HUSSEIN PICKS WAR HERO AS DEFENSE CHIEF; 
</P>
<P>
IRAQ: AN AGING GENERAL IS OUSTED FROM THE POST. IT IS THE PRESIDENT'S SECOND 
RESHUFFLE OF THE HIGH COMMAND IN TWO MONTHS. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein moved Wednesday to rejuvenate his military high 
command for the second time in two months, naming a new defense minister to 
replace the aging general in that post. 
</P>
<P>
The new defense minister, Lt. Gen. Saadi Tuma Jubouri, was a hero of his 
country's 1980-88 war with Iran. As a key division commander, he was known for 
throwing men into battle regardless of casualties, Iraqi veterans say. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment comes less than five weeks before a U.N.-imposed deadline for 
Iraq to get out of Kuwait, the small neighboring sheikdom that Hussein's forces 
invaded Aug. 2. After that deadline, the U.N. Security Council resolution 
authorizes the use of force by U.S.-led multinational troops to liberate 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Jubouri, believed to be in his late 40s, replaces the 70-year-old Gen. 
Abdul-Jabar Shanshal, who was named defense minister in May, 1989, when his 
predecessor was killed in a helicopter crash. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Shanshal was considered an interim replacement. Hussein noted in a 
letter to Shanshal on Wednesday that it was always understood that because of 
his age and health, he would not be asked to serve more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
The text of the letter, broadcast on Baghdad Radio, said the aging general is 
being returned to his previous post of minister of state for military affairs, 
a position that reportedly carries no influence. 
</P>
<P>
According to some reports, Lt. Gen. Jubouri, the new defense minister, devised 
the formidable defensive lines that protected the southern Iraqi city of Basra 
against repeated "human wave" assaults by Iranian troops during the war. He 
also commanded Iraqi forces in heavy fighting on the southern front. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-October, Hussein fired his military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Abdul-Karim 
Khazraji, replacing him with another war hero, Lt. Gen. Hussein Rashid, in a 
shift that was never explained. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the latest top-level shift indicates the Iraqi strongman's 
renewed readiness and willingness to go to war as the U.N. deadline nears. The 
most recent signals to emanate from Baghdad were more conciliatory, as Hussein 
over the last few days released the last of the hundreds of Western hostages 
who wanted to leave Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the sense of urgency here is nightly civil defense instruction on 
Iraqi television, along with the continued call-up of soldiers for the front, 
teen-agers and 40-year-olds included. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with plans to open talks with the United States stalled, Iraq is 
trying to open a second diplomatic front -- this one with the Arab world -- to 
break out of its global isolation. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid arrived in Baghdad on a 
barnstorming mission to arrange a meeting between Hussein and Saudi Arabia's 
King Fahd. There is no indication that Fahd is willing to meet the Iraqi 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq thinks a meeting with King Fahd would be more important than one with 
Bush," one observer here said. "If Fahd agrees to something, the United States 
would have to follow along." 
</P>
<P>
There was no official word on the progress of the Hussein-Bendjedid talks. 
</P>
<P>
Bendjedid is expected to visit Saudi Arabia, where hundreds of thousands of 
U.S. and allied troops are stationed, and Iran after his meetings in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials say they are unhappy not only with Washington's unwillingness 
to agree to a mid-January date for a meeting between President Hussein and 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III but also with the U.S. insistence that 
talks focus only on the demand that Iraq withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Iraq wants what it calls a "deep" discussion of Middle East problems, 
especially the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Washington set a date of Dec. 17 for a meeting between Iraq's Foreign Minister 
Tarik Aziz and President Bush. Iraq wants the Baker-Hussein meeting to take 
place Jan. 12, a date viewed by Washington as too late. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Iraq's Arab allies, notably Jordan, have fueled speculation that Iraq 
might agree to leave Kuwait. In a speech Sunday, Jordan's King Hussein laid out 
a formula for withdrawal: Iraq would begin to leave on "implementation of 
Security Council resolutions," and a peace conference on the Middle East would 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
But the Iraqi Foreign Ministry dismissed the formula. 
</P>
<P>
"We excuse the king. Jordan is suffering consequences for its stand and is 
under pressure," said a Foreign Ministry official, referring to economic 
problems brought on by the international economic blockade of Iraq, which has 
cost Jordan dearly in trade. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some observers both here and in Amman, the Jordanian capital, 
continue to insist that a compromise is in the works.

<P>
Diplomatic Front: The United States accused Iraq of blocking agreement on dates 
for U.S.-Iraqi talks. A State Department spokesman said Iraq continues to 
insist that Secretary of State James A. Baker III meet with Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein on Jan. 12, a date rejected by Washington as too close to the 
U.N. deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: Hussein replaced his defense minister with a young lieutenant 
general who fought in the 1980-88 war against Iran and is considered a 
supporter of Hussein's hard-line stance. Iraq also announced it has set up 370 
civil defense training centers in Baghdad and ordered landlords to build 
air-raid shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition Front: Germany and Japan disputed a U.S. accusation that they have 
delivered only about one-fifth of the aid they promised to assist Operation 
Desert Shield and countries most harshly affected by sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Germany claimed it has made available more than half of the aid. Japan said 
that while it has spent only $600 million of the $4 billion pledged, it is 
about to disburse another $600 million.

WITH ITS HOSTAGES OUT, U.S. REVISES LIST OF IRAQI TARGETS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THE PRESENCE OF 'HUMAN SHIELDS' AT STRATEGIC SITES HAD AFFECTED PLANS 
FOR POSSIBLE ATTACKS.

<TEXT>
<P>
With all U.S. hostages now out of Iraq and Kuwait, U.S. commanders are revising 
their lists of potential targets to include militarily significant sites that 
had been kept off earlier lists because of the presence of Americans held as 
"human shields." 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated Bush Administration assertions to the contrary, the placing of 
American hostages at missile sites, ammunition plants, chemical complexes and 
oil refineries in Iraq and Kuwait had caused military planners to either remove 
those sites from target lists or alter planned attacks on them to minimize the 
possibility of killing the hostages. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush signaled the change last weekend when he said, "When you don't 
have Americans there, and if force is required, that's just one less worry I've 
got." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "I think you can make the case that this facilitates the tough 
decisions that might lie ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Senior military officials said plans are being rewritten to include "secondary" 
or marginal targets that had been declared off-limits because of the presence 
of American hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Also, plans for attacking critical military sites that previously were included 
despite the presence of human shields are being changed to make the raids less 
risky to American pilots, who had been under instructions to make visual 
identification of the targets to avoid inadvertently killing American hostages 
detained nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is that attack options are limited by having people there you don't 
want to kill. Getting these people out gives you a freer hand," one senior 
military officer said. "No American President or chief of staff wants to be in 
a position of ordering military action that takes the lives of 50 or 200 or 500 
innocent American civilians. It's just that simple." 
</P>
<P>
Although the hostages have been evacuated, the State Department says about 500 
Americans are choosing to stay in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Pentagon officials emphasized that the removal of the hostages does not 
make a military strike against Iraqi targets more or less likely; they would be 
attacked only as part of full-scale war in any event. Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III has pledged publicly that the United States will not attack Iraq 
if President Saddam Hussein withdraws all his troops from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Government analysts are debriefing the returning hostages who were used as 
human shields to learn as much as they can about the sites where they were 
held, particularly the military capabilities and detailed layouts of the 
facilities. Some of this information already has been gleaned from non-American 
hostages held at the same facilities who were released earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the crisis in August, President Bush and other senior 
Administration officials have said consistently that the taking of hostages and 
their dispersal to strategic sites would have no impact on U.S. policy or 
military planning. 
</P>
<P>
But, with the hostages now out of danger, military officials say those 
statements were partly a bluff and that in some cases potential targets were 
scrapped because of the presence of hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable officials said potential military targets in Iraq fall into two 
categories: critical military installations that immediately threaten U.S. and 
allied forces, and secondary or marginal targets. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the first group -- including missile launching sites, 
airfields, munitions depots and railroad marshaling yards -- would be hit early 
in any conflict regardless of the presence of foreign hostages. However, these 
officials said, if it were known that Americans were held at a particular site, 
extraordinary measures would have been taken to try to avoid killing them. 
</P>
<P>
"One would weigh in the balance the need to hit a target because of its impact 
on the troops. If taking out a target puts at risk five hostages versus 5,000 
troops, what do you do?" asked a senior defense official, who clearly believed 
the answer was evident. "You might approach a target in a different way if 
someone were there, though." 
</P>
<P>
Such alternative approaches might include a daylight strike rather than 
nighttime raid, or the use of low-level aircraft and precision-guided bombs 
rather than high-altitude bombardment to try to assure that the weapons hit 
specific buildings or facilities. Such operations are far riskier for pilots 
and create the possibility of losing planes and having aviators taken captive. 
</P>
<P>
With the hostages removed, targeters can now rewrite the "mission profiles" and 
fall back on the full range of U.S. weaponry -- long-range "stand-off" missiles 
fired from aircraft or ships, naval bombardment and carpet bombing by heavy 
B-52s. 
</P>
<P>
Returning hostages have said they were held at a number of sites that might 
fall into the category of "high-value" military targets: a munitions factory 
south of Baghdad, the chemical weapons plant at Al Qaim on the Syrian border, a 
military airfield near Basra in the south of Iraq and the missile assembly 
complex at Mosul, north of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Many sites from the second group of non-essential targets had been scratched 
from the planners' target lists when it was learned that Americans had been 
sent there as shields, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on accounts from returned hostages, such potential targets may have 
included a dam and industrial complex on the Tigris River in northern Iraq, a 
steel plant north of Baghdad used to manufacture artillery, oil and natural gas 
refineries and the Tamuz nuclear reactor complex south of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Such sites would be desirable targets "for long-term reasons or their impact on 
Saddam Hussein or the Iraqi people" rather than because they are immediately 
threatening to U.S. forces, one defense official said. 
</P>
<P>
With the removal of the hostages, he added, "They might be ones you could go 
ahead now and hit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HUMAN SHIELD SITES 
</P>
<P>
Some of the strategic sites where returning hostages said they were held. 
Descriptions and locations are as precise as the hostages gave in interviews: 
</P>
<P>
* Alexandria 3 ammunition factory south of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
* Chemical weapons plant at Al Qaim near Syrian border.

OUSTED BANGLADESH PRESIDENT AND WIFE ARRESTED

<P>
Police and soldiers arrested ousted Bangladesh President Hussain Mohammed 
Ershad and his wife on Wednesday, and the government said he will face trial on 
charges ranging from gold smuggling to plundering money from the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Police launched a manhunt for 13 former ministers in Ershad's Cabinet after 
acting President Shahabuddin Ahmed ordered their arrests, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The former president has been kept in safe custody," Interior Ministry 
Secretary Azimuddin Ahmed said. 
</P>
<P>
Ershad, who seized power in a 1982 military coup, was arrested with his wife, 
Roushan Ara, in Dhaka's military garrison area where he had been living since 
his resignation last week. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's two adopted children -- a son and a daughter -- and Ershad's 
mother-in-law were allowed to accompany them into detention at the former 
British high commissioner's residence in the Gulshan diplomatic enclave, Ahmed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said a special tribunal headed by a High Court judge will be set up 
to try Ershad on charges ranging from gold smuggling to nepotism and plundering 
money from the impoverished country. 
</P>
<P>
As reports of the arrest spread, curious Dhaka residents lined roads to the 
army headquarters. But the fallen general had been whisked away hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could see the shame-faced dictator," said one young man standing 
outside the garrison. 
</P>
<P>
"The bird has changed cages," said another. 
</P>
<P>
The acting president ordered the arrest of 14 former Cabinet members, including 
former Interior Minister Mahmudul Hasan, who was placed under house arrest 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Others have been hiding but we have launched a manhunt to seize them," a 
senior police officer said. 
</P>
<P>
Ershad stepped down and transferred power to former Chief Justice Shahabuddin 
after a violent campaign by 22 opposition parties.

FEDERAL DECISION RESTRICTS MINORITY SCHOLARSHIP FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: COLLEGE OFFICIALS EXPRESS SHOCK OVER ANNOUNCED CURBS. THEY WARN THE 
ACTION COULD HARM EFFORTS TO ENROLL BLACKS AND LATINOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Colleges that receive federal funds cannot offer scholarships designated only 
for minority students unless there is evidence of past discrimination, a U.S. 
Department of Education official confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision has shocked and confused many college financial aid experts around 
the nation who say it could harm efforts to raise enrollment of blacks and 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
At a Washington press conference Wednesday, Michael L. Williams, assistant 
secretary of education for civil rights, confirmed reports that he had warned 
officials of the Fiesta Bowl that their offer of $100,000 in minority 
scholarships to the schools playing in that football game could violate federal 
civil rights law. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams, who has been in his post only six months, also acknowledged that 
his advice to the Fiesta Bowl conflicts with a federal policy upheld just last 
year regarding similar minority scholarships at the University of Colorado. 
And, he said he had not cleared the matter with anyone at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The action by Williams was first reported by the Chronicle of Higher Education, 
a weekly journal, and also was reported in Wednesday editions of the New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Many colleges administer gifts from private donors who want to specifically 
help, for example, young black biologists or Asian musicians. In other cases, 
some schools earmark parts of their own aid funds for minority applicants. Both 
instances would be illegal under Williams' opinion unless the aid is intended 
to overcome specific bias. 
</P>
<P>
However, education experts cautioned colleges not to rush to drop any minority 
scholarship programs. There was added uncertainty because the department's 
secretary, Lauro F. Cavazos, announced his resignation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the debate is only begining on this. There will be an intense 
political debate about the appropriateness of this particular interpretation," 
said Jon Fuller, president of the Washington-based Consortium for the 
Advancement of Private Education, a group that channels aid to small, private 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Fitzgerald, staff director of the congressionally established Advisory 
Committee on Student Financial Assistance, also predicted much controversy. He 
called Williams' opinion "unsound" and said he feared it could foster 
dishonesty. "It suggests that institutions could have published policies that 
things are color blind and then wink at black students and say: 'Don't worry 
about it. We will help you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, colleges and universities were worried, with some financial aid 
officers viewing the opinion as an attack on affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
"This comes as a really great shock to me that the (Department of Education's) 
Office of Civil Rights is challenging widely accepted practices around the 
country," said Claudia Mitchell-Kernan, UCLA's vice chancellor and dean for 
graduate programs. She stressed that financial aid is one of the few ways to 
address the low numbers of women and minorities in certain fields. 
</P>
<P>
Richard F. Rosser, president of the National Assn. of Independent Colleges and 
Universities, contended Williams' statement could send financial aid programs 
"into chaos" and have "a devastating effect on the recruitment of minorities." 
</P>
<P>
"We thought what we were doing was exactly in the interests of this nation," 
Rosser said, referring to the affirmative action aid. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Wednesday, a Department of Education spokesman 
cautioned that the government is not going to investigate scholarship programs 
unless someone files a complaint. Five such complaints are now pending, 
although the Fiesta Bowl scholarship was not among those. According to the 
spokesman, Williams "just came forward and offered technical assistance" in 
that case. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said he knew neither how many 
schools could be affected by a policy change nor what proportion of financial 
aid is designated for minorities. "It's a big universe out there," he said. 
"There are a lot of private donations coming in, so the numbers are almost 
incalculable." 
</P>
<P>
Fiesta Bowl officials in Tempe, Ariz., offered $100,000 in minority aid to the 
universities of Louisville and Alabama after Arizona voters rejected a holiday 
honoring assassinated civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The King 
vote prompted the National Football League to threaten to pull the 1993 Super 
Bowl from Phoenix, and the annual Fiesta Bowl faced a similar protest from 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
At his press conference, Williams said his office is working with Fiesta Bowl, 
Louisville and Alabama officials to devise an acceptable program, one that 
would include other criteria such as family income. 
</P>
<P>
The United Negro College Fund in New York issued a statement Wednesday saying 
that its scholarships at historically black colleges are awarded on financial 
need. Although the underlying assumption is that black students will benefit, 
there is nothing race specific in the awards, the fund said.

CRASHED JET'S ESCAPE HATCH FOUND BLOCKED

Investigators found a broken emergency release in the tail of a Northwest 
Airlines DC-9 in which eight people died after it collided with another plane 
on a runway, federal officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A flight attendant and a passenger tried to escape through the hatch, but they 
died after the release jammed and trapped them inside, the Detroit News 
reported Wednesday, citing an unidentified source. 
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 727 was racing toward takeoff at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Dec. 
3 when it struck the taxiing DC-9, which had turned in front of it. The 
Northwest 727's right wing clipped the DC-9 behind the co-pilot's seat and 
knocked an engine off the DC-9. 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing fire moved quickly through the DC-9, which had 39 passengers and 
four crew members aboard. 
</P>
<P>
"Investigators have found, after extensive testing, that the interior tail cone 
release mechanism failed to separate the tail cone and deploy the emergency 
slide," National Transportation Safety Board member John Lauber said. 
</P>
<P>
"The interior release handle was found partially raised from its stowed 
position during the safety board's initial examination. Investigators inspected 
the interior release handle and have found the stem of the handle broken." 
</P>
<P>
The source told the newspaper investigators determined that the flight 
attendant and passenger made it through one emergency hatch to a catwalk in the 
plane's tail cone, and one of them pulled a red handle designed to pop off the 
tail cone and release a slide. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Pollock, a safety board spokesman, said the board was only reporting the 
broken handle, and he would not speculate on whether the flight attendant or 
passenger had pulled it.

GOTTI INDICTED IN 1985 MURDER OF CRIME BOSS; 
</P>
<P>
MAFIA: PROSECUTORS SAY EVIDENCE AGAINST THE REPUTED MOB CZAR INCLUDES SECRETLY 
TAPED CONVERSATIONS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Yorkers are calling it "The Godfather: Part IV" -- a real-life drama now 
unfolding here that calls to mind the three-part Hollywood saga of the 
fictional Corleone family. 
</P>
<P>
In yet another attempt by authorities to nail reputed East Coast mob czar John 
Gotti, federal prosecutors Wednesday charged the 50-year-old "Dapper Don" with 
the 1985 murder of the man he allegedly succeeded as head of America's most 
powerful organized crime family. 
</P>
<P>
Gotti, a silver-haired, barrel-chested man with a penchant for expensive, 
tailor-made suits and a flair for favorable publicity, has avoided conviction 
so many times before that he has earned the nickname of "The Teflon Don" and 
gained a reputation as something of a local folk hero. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors seeking his conviction in this latest legal effort said that 
their hopes are buoyed by the strength of the evidence they have amassed, 
including key witnesses and secretly taped conversations between Gotti and his 
henchmen. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's a very strong case," U.S. Atty. Andrew J. Maloney of the Eastern 
District of New York said at a news conference in the Brooklyn federal 
courthouse to announce the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Once the trial begins, Maloney confidently predicted, the public will see Gotti 
for what he really is. "He's a murderer, not a folk hero," Maloney said. "His 
real job is boss of the most powerful crime family in this country." 
</P>
<P>
The 23-page, double-spaced indictment charges Gotti with four murders, chief 
among them the bloody slaying of Gambino family boss Paul Castellano in front 
of a Manhattan steakhouse almost exactly four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Castellano's murder catapulted Gotti to power as head of the Gambino family, 
the largest of New York's five organized crime families, and made him "boss of 
all the bosses" for organized crime, law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping indictment, brought under federal anti-racketeering laws, also 
charges Gotti with gambling, loan-sharking, obstruction of justice, tax evasion 
and conspiracy to murder a fifth person. 
</P>
<P>
Three other Gambino family members are named in the indictment. They were 
identified as "consigliere" or counselor Salvatore (Sammy Bull) Gravano, 45, 
and "underboss" Frank (Frankie Loc) Locascio, 58, both of whom serve as No. 2 
men to Gotti, and "capo" or captain Thomas Gambino, 61, son of former boss 
Carlo Gambino. 
</P>
<P>
All three are charged with gambling and loan-sharking. In addition, Gravano is 
charged with two murders, conspiracy to murder, solicitation to murder and 
obstruction of justice, while Locascio is charged with conspiracy to murder, 
obstruction of justice and aiding Gotti's alleged tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we have taken down the entire hierarchy of an organized 
crime family -- the boss, the underboss, the consigliere," said James Fox, head 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Cutler, Gotti's attorney, claimed that his client is the innocent victim 
of a vendetta by law enforcement officials. Gotti has been tried and acquitted 
three times before on either federal or state charges of racketeering and 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same kind of crap that we dealt with in 1986 and 1987," Cutler said. 
"The same kind of Mafia-madness nonsense that starts with a two-week blitz in 
the newspapers. I know it's a vendetta. It's happened three times before." 
</P>
<P>
During his last trial, Gotti captured media attention and the public fancy by 
handing out $50 bills to the homeless outside the courthouse. They responded by 
carrying large placards reading: "Free Gotti Now!" 
</P>
<P>
The latest indictment is the culmination of a five-year investigation involving 
federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Gotti, Gravano and Locascio were arrested by FBI agents and New York City 
police detectives about 7 p.m. Tuesday at Gotti's Manhattan hangout, the 
Ravenite social club in Little Italy, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Gambino was taken into custody at about the same time as he left the Garment 
District office of his trucking company. 
</P>
<P>
Gotti, who maintains that he is a salesman for a plumbing company and for a 
firm that sells zippers and hangers to the garment industry, was carrying 
$6,000 in cash at the time of his arrest, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gotti pleaded innocent at his arraignment Wednesday afternoon before U.S. 
District Judge I. Leo Glasser. Glasser ordered Gotti held without bail until 
Monday, when Maloney is to present further evidence to support his claim that 
Gotti is a danger to the community. 
</P>
<P>
Gravano and Locascio also were ordered held without bail, but Gambino was 
released on a $500,000 bond.

STEREOTYPES HINDER MINORITIES' ATTEMPTS TO REACH MANAGERIAL RANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Almost 60% of Latino journalists surveyed in California this year said they 
plan to leave their jobs within 10 years. About 36% of Asian-American 
journalists said they are likely to leave journalism altogether within five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike whites who leave -- in much smaller numbers, generally citing boredom 
and poor pay -- minorities mostly cite their lack of advancement opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
More minorities than whites say they want to go into management -- some because 
of personal and professional ambition, some because they see journalism as a 
vehicle for exposing and even correcting longstanding inequities in U.S. 
society. Frustrated by their inability to attain positions of authority on 
their newspapers, a growing number of minority journalists are deciding to look 
outside journalism to achieve their objectives. 
</P>
<P>
Some Asian-American journalists feel their prospects for advancement may be 
particularly bleak because of stereotypical perceptions about them by white 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
The stereotyping begins at the reportorial level, where Asian-Americans are far 
more likely to be made education and business writers than, say, film critics 
or sportswriters. When it comes time for promotions, Asians say, they are often 
erroneously seen as "techno-coolies" -- hard workers, meticulous, conscientious 
but not especially creative or imaginative; they're also regarded as too 
passive, not assertive or aggressive enough to be editors. 
</P>
<P>
That means that Asian-Americans are far more likely to be made copy editors 
than city editors or managing editors. 
</P>
<P>
But as K. Connie Kang, an assistant metropolitan editor at the San Francisco 
Examiner, points out, in "Confucian-steeped cultures, talking about your 
virtues is a shameful thing . . . speaking up is not a polite thing. You're 
supposed to expect people in positions of authority to recognize your abilities 
and appreciate you, rather than you having to go to them and . . . ask for a 
raise, ask for a promotion." 
</P>
<P>
Simon Li, deputy foreign editor at the Los Angeles Times, says the emphasis on 
education in most Asian families leads many Asians to believe that their 
achievements are measurable and that rewards will come accordingly, without 
being specifically sought. Because of these factors of cultural conditioning, 
many Asians not only think it inappropriate to ask for promotions, they may 
refuse to apply when openings are available. 
</P>
<P>
But some white editors, unaware of this cultural difference, may think the 
talented Asian-Americans who don't apply for a given job don't really want it 
or would be insufficiently aggressive to do it properly if they got it. Editors 
also argue that if Asian-Americans want to succeed in a Western world still 
dominated by white attitudes and practices, they'll have to adapt -- to push 
themselves for promotion the way many whites do. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Matsuda, an assistant editor in the View section of the Los Angeles 
Times, argues, however, that if he has to make such a fundamental change in 
himself to get promoted, then what he's won is, at best, "a Pyrrhic victory." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Asians who do not fit the stereotype, who speak out and push 
themselves just like many whites, are often regarded as troublemakers precisely 
because they don't behave as expected. So they may not get promoted either.

JERRY WHEELER, 44; PRODUCER FOR TV, FILM, STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry B. Wheeler, a film, television and theatrical producer and writer, has 
died of complications of AIDS. He was 44. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler died Saturday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death, Wheeler was producing "The Front Runner," a film 
based on Patricia Nell Warren's 1974 novel about a college athletic coach's 
homosexual affair with a young track star. Wheeler attributed delays in making 
the film during the past five years to difficulty in finding a major 
middle-aged male star willing to portray a homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler's production company, On the Right Track Productions, will continue 
making the film under his instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New York, Wheeler first worked as a child actor in daytime television 
shows. He also worked during his teens as an associate to a Broadway producer 
and as assistant stage manager for the Metropolitan Opera Company. 
</P>
<P>
Moving to Los Angeles in 1968, he coordinated production for such CBS-TV 
variety series as "The Carol Burnett Show," "The Red Skelton Show" and the 
"Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour." 
</P>
<P>
After heading his own personal management firm for seven years, he began 
producing films. 
</P>
<P>
His first effort was "The Last Resort," later retitled "Tropic of Desire," with 
Eartha Kitt and Tom Ewell. 
</P>
<P>
For theater, Wheeler wrote, produced and directed the comedy "Dracula Sucks" 
and produced "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Wheeler produced a controversial series of five television spots for 
the California Department of Mental Health promoting tolerance about 
homosexuality. The spots, featuring Ed Asner, Abigail Van Buren and other 
celebrities, were kept off the air for years by the administration of then-Gov. 
Jerry Brown on grounds that they were an improper use of taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler also created and co-produced the annual media awards shows for the 
Alliance for Gay &amp; Lesbian Artists and was an adviser to the Los Angeles 
International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film/Video Festival. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his mother, Edna; a brother, Gene, and his longtime 
companion, Steve Badeau. 
</P>
<P>
The family has requested that memorial contributions be made to AIDS Project 
Los Angeles, 6721 Romaine St., Los Angeles 90038, or the American Foundation 
for AIDS Research, 5900 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles 90036.

LOTTERY BOARD CUTBACK ELIMINATES 50 JOBS

The state Lottery Commission, which once had excess money for operations, cut 
50 jobs Wednesday as part of a $59-million, 15%-budget cut this fiscal year to 
offset sluggish game sales. 
</P>
<P>
The policy-setting board voted 4 to 0 to approve the latest round of nearly $19 
million in reductions, effective Jan. 1, including elimination of 50 vacant 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
None of the agency's 1,100 workers will be fired but a freeze will continue on 
the hiring of replacements for departing workers. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first serious cutback in the five-year history of the voter-approved 
games but is not directly related to the state budget crisis, since lottery 
administration is funded by up to 16% of ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials blamed sluggish sales on the flagging economy and the lack of 
a big jackpot needed to attract players.

PORT HUENEME 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three hundred tired but jovial Seabees returned early Wednesday morning from 
Saudi Arabia -- the first group from the naval construction base to come home 
since the U.S. buildup began in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
At least 300 more men from Port Hueneme's Naval Construction Battalion Center, 
which specializes in building military bases from scratch in a few weeks, are 
expected to return by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I'm going to do is kiss my wife and kids," said Jim Albright, 
36, of Chicago. "Then I'm going to have a nice, cold beer." 
</P>
<P>
The Seabees traditionally are deployed for seven months at a time, which is why 
the group was able to come home before other military units called up in 
California since the start of the Iraqi crisis. The unit had been on assignment 
in Puerto Rico before being routed to Saudi Arabia in mid-September as part of 
Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
"We always felt that they would be coming back on time," said Capt. R.J. 
Pearson III, the commanding officer of the Seabee, or Construction Battalion, 
base. "Even when the word broke that no units would be deploying home, we felt 
the Seabees would be the exception. It's traditionally what has been done." 
</P>
<P>
After another group of Seabees returns from Saudi Arabia next week, 1,200 from 
Port Hueneme will still remain in the Middle East -- the largest deployment 
from the Ventura County base since the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
The 300 Seabees who returned Wednesday morning spent 30 hours traveling from 
Saudi Arabia in a chartered World Airways DC-10. They stopped over in Rome and 
in Maine before arriving at Port Hueneme shortly after 2:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the early hour and the long trip, the men were spirited. Some departed 
the plane cheering. Others laughed and joked as they scurried aboard buses that 
would shuttle them to waiting families and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to sleep in a comfortable bed and have a nice meal," said 
Dominick Bambace, 21, as he paused to listen to the cheers of a few passing 
sailors. 
</P>
<P>
Bambace, who like many of his companions still clutched his gas mask, said he 
looked forward to shedding his chemical weapons gear. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had the guys carry their gas masks 100% of the time," Lt. Cmdr. Michael 
Schiffner said. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Potter, 30, said the biggest fears at their camp in eastern Saudi Arabia 
were the threat of terrorist strikes or being attacked with chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the air raid sirens would go off accidentally," Potter said. "It 
would just send panic though the camp. We would grab our gear and our gas masks 
and run for the shelters. Twenty minutes later, we would find out it was a 
mistake. . . . It took a while to come down from that." 
</P>
<P>
But Schiffner said the men spent most of their time in well-fortified areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Seabees' job, which had them working sunrise to sunset seven days a week, 
was to erect tents and camps for Marines and build an aircraft landing strip, 
weapons storage facilities and a road. 
</P>
<P>
As Schiffner spoke on the airport Tarmac, several buses passed, shuttling the 
soldiers away to meet their families and friends. 
</P>
<P>
One man leaned out the window. 
</P>
<P>
"Merry Christmas," he said. "Merry Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Schiffner smiled and added: "It's good to be home for the holidays."

2 CANDIDATES USE SIGN LANGUAGE TO STAKE OUT MOLINA'S EAST SIDE TURF

<P>
It is a little-discussed fact of political campaigning that the brightly 
colored signs placed by candidates in front yards and on telephone poles have 
virtually no effect on the decisions voters make. 
</P>
<P>
But a forest of signs appeared last week on the East Side of Los Angeles 
touting state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) and Sarah Flores, former aide to 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum. They are running in the special election Jan. 22 for 
county supervisor in the 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
"These signs are the dumbest expenditure I have ever seen," said veteran 
campaign consultant Richard Ross, who is working for another candidate, state 
Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), and is buying no lawn signs. "They are 
spending money in a sweaty panic." 
</P>
<P>
Flores' people said they spent $26,000 on signs knowing that they "will not 
really alter how people vote." But they hope to demoralize City Councilwoman 
Gloria Molina's campaign workers by studding her turf with somebody else's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Torres' camp allowed only a few days to pass before posting his signs next to 
virtually every Flores sign. Was it also to demoralize Molina? 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like marking our territory or something," said Torres spokeswoman 
Dee Dee Myers. "I don't think it's a big vote-getter. . . . But maybe people 
will see some lawn signs and say hey, there must be a campaign going on here." 
</P>
<P>
For several months now, there's been a deep rift between Schabarum and his 
former longtime aide Flores, who is running for his job. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, when Schabarum decided to leave the political seat he had held for 
years, he threw his support to a Superior Court judge and attacked Flores in 
the acerbic style for which he is noted, remarking: "Sarah does not have the 
educational background . . . the organizational talents . . . nor the personal 
skills that are simply required to fill this job." 
</P>
<P>
Flores' campaign managers say Schabarum's comments "actually helped Sarah" 
finish first in the June primary race for his seat, an election since 
invalidated by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum's comments are still smarting, apparently. At Flores' home in 
Glendora recently, her relatives showed off her trophy room -- a comfortable 
den where the framed plaques and parchment commendations she received while 
working for Schabarum are proudly displayed. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, none of the commendations displayed on the walls mentions Schabarum. 
Flores' relatives say the candidate does have a pile of plaques and letters 
that also thank the lame-duck supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
They are kept in a cupboard in the laundry room. 
</P>
<P>
Automobile insurance was the subject of a recent debate between the 1st 
District supervisorial candidates. It is an issue over which Californians are 
very angry, but over which the Board of Supervisors has no say. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the event sponsored by a group of insurance agents drew all four 
major candidates seeking to become the first Latino county supervisor this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Molina admitted that she found it odd to be speaking about auto insurance -- a 
state issue. But, she said, she receives many invitations to events that don't 
seem to have anything to do with the office she holds or is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
Of the insurance agents who sponsored the discussion, she said: "They sort of 
pressure you, saying the other candidates are coming and this is an important 
issue to your voters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The other thing they did," she added, "is they called the press and (then) 
said the press will be here." 
</P>
<P>
A three-man band was wailing away at "Mirasol," a slow rumba, when Flores 
brought her campaign to the cafeteria of the Fairmount Terrace Senior 
Apartments in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, 73-year-old Jaime Ramon Carlos took her by the hand and 
began to dance, deftly wrapping an arm around her waist and slowing spinning 
her around a couple of times for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Carlos was asked what he thought of the candidate: 
</P>
<P>
"She's got a good sense of rhythm. . . . What's her name?" 
</P>
<P>
More problems followed for the 53-year-old candidate. She addressed the 
gathering of about 40 seniors, speaking at length in English and Spanish about 
her concerns for the elderly. Then came the first question. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you running for?" 
</P>
<P>
Flores politely explained, throwing in a brief description of the duties of a 
county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
She took a second question: 
</P>
<P>
"What's your name?" 
</P>
<P>

SPECIAL SCHOOLS TAKE IN EXPELLED STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
David is 16, a smooth-cheeked teen-ager from Echo Park with a hesitant smile 
and a habit of glancing away when you look in his eyes as he recalls how he 
landed at a school for delinquents in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
An admitted gang member who has been thrown out of several high schools for 
fighting, David most recently attended a high school in Northeast Los Angeles 
whose turf was claimed by another gang. After members of that gang threatened 
to kill him, David started bringing a knife to school. 
</P>
<P>
The showdown came when one of the gang members pointed a gun at his head and 
David stabbed him. "I was scared he was going to kill me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
David's story is all too common among students at Community Day Centers, the 
schools run by Los Angeles County for students who have been expelled by their 
districts or put on probation for crimes. But educators say it also illustrates 
the need for educational alternatives as districts throughout the county 
toughen expulsion policies to crack down on violence. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, 890 students were recommended for 
expulsion in the 1989-90 academic year, 69% of them for assaults or for 
bringing firearms to class. That was a 17% increase over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
David is one of the lucky ones -- he is already enrolled in one of the county's 
14 special schools, which serve 476 students from throughout the county. But 
educators estimate that hundreds more problem students as young as 13 are being 
turned out onto the street because the county schools are full. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to the East Los Angeles center, housed in two classrooms leased from 
Our Lady of Victory Catholic Church, illustrates how the small schools are 
looser and provide more individualized attention than larger high schools. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day after lunch, David filed back into his seat and joined 12 other 
students bent over desks, laboring over spelling and driver's education. Two 
students who finished their class work early drifted up to the personal 
computers at the front of the class to play computer games. A "classic oldies" 
AM station played softly in the background. 
</P>
<P>
Because the students are spread across different grade levels, there are no 
formal lessons. Instead, each new arrival is given an achievement test and a 
personalized independent study program is drawn up, based on ability and need. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Don Lucero said his students work at their own pace through math and 
English, science and social studies. He provides help and answers as needed, 
and over the years has even worked with several students who took advanced 
placement classes for college credit. But Lucero acknowledges that few students 
get past pre-algebra. 
</P>
<P>
As Lucero talks, a tall, beefy 17-year-old named George ambles up to him, 
showing off a spelling test. But George has only done about half his assigned 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, c'mon dude, I told you to write me sentences with those words," Lucero 
tells him. "Don't give me that dirty look. Hey, that's good," he adds, as 
George moves back to his seat with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
The victories at Our Lady of Victory are not always apparent at first glance. 
Students say fistfights break out regularly. Last week, for instance, Lucero 
sent home four teen-agers who started a gang fight in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get rid of them, I want to change their bad behavioral 
patterns," said Lucero, a mild-mannered man who at times appears harried by his 
charges. "But it's very difficult to change a lifestyle. Their values are 
completely different." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, students leave the grounds, walking to the corner market to buy 
sodas or potato chips. As a reward for good behavior, they are allowed to play 
basketball in a court on the church parking lot. And school administrators 
emphasize that most students do behave: They know that getting expelled from 
the center means a return to Juvenile Hall or the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep reminding them that this is neutral territory," says Lucero, who has 
taught at the East Los Angeles campus for five years. "They know what the rules 
are, and they know I'm not going to put up with any gangbanging." 
</P>
<P>
The county downplays the potential for violence at the centers, saying there 
were only two assaults at its 14 schools during the first six months of 1990. A 
two-year study of one center in Southeast Los Angeles found that more than half 
its students either stayed in school, graduated, re-enrolled at regular high 
schools or found jobs. Their average age was 15 1/2; their average stay was two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Many students at the East Los Angeles center say they are relieved to be out of 
regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to stay here because I don't want to get into any more trouble," 
said Janet, a pretty 13-year-old with sloe eyes and long, wavy black hair. The 
youngest member of her East Los Angeles gang, Janet was expelled from junior 
high school for chronic fighting. All her brothers and sisters are gang 
members, Janet says, and it is hard to walk outside and not socialize with kids 
from the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't go back to a regular school now because I'd get my butt kicked," she 
says nervously. "A lot of people out there don't like me." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the students are emotionally troubled youths or hard-core delinquents 
probably headed for a life of crime. But others appear to have brought weapons 
to school to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Goldberg, president of the Los Angeles Board of Education, said the vast 
majority of expulsions involve possession, not use, of a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of it is gang-related and almost all these kids say the same thing in 
their interview: 'I was afraid what would happen on the way home. I was jumped 
on Monday and they told me they were going to kill me on Tuesday.' These kids 
are afraid, they are ruled by fear, and they think a gun is going to protect 
them," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
School board member Julie Korenstein, who sponsored the tough expulsion policy 
that was approved in June for Los Angeles students, echoed Goldberg's comments. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a case last week in which a 14-year-old who was jumped by a gang 
brought an unloaded weapon to school because he was scared to death," 
Korenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The district is evaluating sites where the county might open new centers, but a 
proposal to convert a closed junior high in a residential part of Woodland 
Hills was dropped this week after neighbors protested. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the district is looking at putting classrooms for expelled students on 
sites where adult education and dropout prevention programs are run. The county 
has said it will operate new centers if Los Angeles Unified and other districts 
provide the sites. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to think about what our responsibilities are, not just as educators 
but as a community," Korenstein said. "It costs $4,000 to $6,000 a year to 
rehabilitate these students. If we wait until they get into prison, it's 
$30,000 a year." 
</P>
<P>
The students at the East Los Angeles center seem to agree. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't reject you here," says David, who hopes to join the Army when he 
graduates. "We're not crazy, we're just disturbed. And they help us."

ETHICS PANEL FEELS L.A. BUDGET PINCH; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: STAFF POSITIONS FOR THE PROPOSED WATCHDOG AGENCY ARE STUCK IN A 
CITYWIDE HIRING FREEZE. THE COMMISSION WAS TO BEGIN WORK ON JAN. 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new, much-heralded political watchdog agency at City Hall could be hobbled as 
it moves to enact a sweeping package of reforms approved by voters in the wake 
of the ethics scandal surrounding Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
All staff positions for the city Ethics Commission, which is supposed to begin 
its work Jan. 1, have been frozen under the mayor's emergency, citywide order 
to halt hiring and reduce a potential $120-million budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
A Bradley spokesman said Wednesday that it is "premature" to say whether the 
ethics panel's proposed 16-member staff will be exempted from the hiring 
freeze. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley ordered the freeze to "prevent more drastic measures such as police 
layoffs and tax increases later," said Bill Chandler, the mayor's press 
secretary. "Exemptions . . . will be considered on a case-by-case basis only." 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign for voter approval of Proposition H last June, supporters 
said the new enforcement agency would be the centerpiece of the ethics reforms 
designed to reduce the influence of City Hall special interests and curb 
potential conflicts of interest among public officials. 
</P>
<P>
The first wave of reforms takes effect next month, when the fledgling agency is 
scheduled to assume a variety of legal duties. Those include enforcing 
toughened campaign disclosure laws, developing detailed new ethics regulations 
and educating city officials about potential conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ethics Commission President Dennis Curtis said his five-member panel 
cannot perform those tasks without adequate staff. "We're just going to have to 
fight it out . . . we're going to have to get the (employees) necessary to 
allow us to do our job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The USC law professor said he had not discussed the hiring freeze with Bradley, 
but nonetheless expressed optimism that his commission will be permitted to 
proceed with plans to hire an executive director in the next several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Cowan, who headed a Bradley-appointed citizens' committee that drafted 
the ethics reform laws, said the watchdog agency's job is formidable and that 
without a "good and full staff" its start-up could become a "nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
"No one is going to know how the law is supposed to work," said Cowan, a former 
chairman of California Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is new and small, the ethics agency is likely to be given some 
staff, several officials said. But the deteriorating budget picture in recent 
weeks has riveted City Hall attention on more basic concerns, such as 
maintaining the size of the police force in a near-record year of bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Chase, assistant city administrative officer, said the ethics agency 
positions, while important, must be weighed against other pressing needs, such 
as police officers, firefighters and trash collectors. 
</P>
<P>
"The policy question is do you (staff) this new body instead of other high 
priority jobs," said Chase, who will be evaluating hiring freeze exemption 
requests for Bradley. "That's a tough question. . . . I'm not sure what we'll 
recommend." 
</P>
<P>
Chase said a fully staffed ethics panel would cost up to $657,000 over the 
remaining six months of the 1990-91 fiscal year. That figure would grow in 
1991-92 as more staff and duties are added, including starting up a City Hall 
whistle-blower hot line. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the city's Budget and Finance 
Committee, predicted the ethics panel will be allowed to fill most, if not all, 
of its positions. 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "There ought to be a debate about how much they need. They (are 
not) exempt from shouldering the burden" of the budget shortfall. "As bad as 
our ethics problems are in City Hall, crime in the streets is a much more 
serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
Reform leaders said the hiring freeze spotlights a weakness of the final 
version of the ethics reform package -- the lack of a secure source of funds 
for the ethics agency. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a dedicated source of money from the beginning," said Cowan. He has 
voiced concern that shifting City Hall spending priorities -- or even 
politically motivated budget cuts -- could undermine the ethics panel's 
independence and effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan argued that voters addressed the current financial crunch, particularly 
the choice between hiring police officers and ethics officials. "The campaign 
against (the ethics reform measure) was run on the basis that we need the money 
for other services, including police," Cowan said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : SEARCH PARTY COMBS HILLS FOR MISSING 
OFFICER, 41 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities on Wednesday conducted an intensive search of the hills north of 
Moorpark for a Los Angeles police officer who disappeared after leaving work 
Sunday night in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
But by nightfall, the 80-member search party -- including many off-duty 
officers -- had found no sign of Sgt. Christopher Vasquez, 41, a 20-year 
veteran of the force. 
</P>
<P>
The search for Vasquez, who was recently separated from his wife, centered on 
the hilly, undeveloped area behind the townhouse where he had recently moved. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities feared that Vasquez, described as an avid runner who often used the 
trails behind his home, may have been hurt or lost. But they also acknowledged 
that Vasquez may have been depressed and suicidal because of his marital 
problems.

LABORATORY 
</P>

<P>
Federal agents have arrested three alleged gang members in a raid on a North 
Hollywood laboratory capable of producing millions of dollars worth of the 
illegal drug "ice," according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Dong Soo (Danny) Kim, 36; Chul Jin Nam, 35, and Nam Soo Kang, 31, were arrested 
on suspicion of conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine, DEA 
agents said. They were arraigned Wednesday in U.S. District Court and ordered 
held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
The lab was found Tuesday in an apartment where Kang lived, DEA spokesman Ralph 
Lochridge said. He said agents confiscated enough raw materials to produce 10 
pounds of "ice," a colorless, odorless form of methamphetamine crystals that is 
smoked.

WALTER WINCHELL MEMORABILIA SOLD; 
</P>
<P>
AUCTIONS: MANY SEEM MORE INTERESTED IN THE STARS HE COVERED THAN IN THE FAMED 
GOSSIP COLUMNIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is said that famed gossip columnist Walter Winchell could make a star or 
snuff out a career with the stroke of his pen. 
</P>
<P>
But at an auction of the journalist's memorabilia in Hollywood Wednesday, it 
became apparent that in the end, the allure of the stars has outlived the 
star-maker. 
</P>
<P>
The auction room wasn't quite full at the auction house of Butterfield &amp; 
Butterfield when bidding began simultaneously in San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
On the auction block were more than 40,000 letters, radio scripts and 
photographs collected by Winchell during the nearly five decades he ruled 
Hollywood with a newspaper column and microphone -- a man who was as hated in 
some circles as he was feared in others. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the items related to Winchell's celebrity subjects -- rather than 
the journalist's personal effects -- that garnered the most attention. It 
seemed that many who attended the auction were more interested in the golden 
age Winchell represented than in the man himself. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell died in 1972, but the materials were recently consigned for auction by 
his granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Doris Harris paid the highest price of the day when she bid $10,000 for a 
letter in which "Gone With the Wind" author Margaret Mitchell corrected an item 
written about her in Winchell's column. Another bidder paid $6,000 for a 
single-spaced letter sent from Hotel Ambos Mundos in Havana, in which Ernest 
Hemingway writes that his publisher believes his current novel has "F. to A. 
("A Farewell to Arms") beat." 
</P>
<P>
The prices and interest level had been expected -- even though some collectors 
said they'd seen larger turnouts for other celebrity auctions. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of interest from book collectors, autograph collectors, 
anybody interested in a bygone era," said Butterfield &amp; Butterfield 
spokeswoman Laura Smissaert, who said the nearly two-hour auction yielded 
$140,000. "Winchell was one of the most influential people in the '30s, '40s 
and '50s." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Milan said he had come to the auction not because he was a fan of Winchell 
but because he wanted to add to his collection of celebrity memorabilia. Among 
his acquisitions: a $700 file that included a letter from former President 
Richard Nixon about a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the letter is going to go on the wall of my office," said Milan -- a 
dentist. 
</P>
<P>
But there were some who were drawn by Winchell. 
</P>
<P>
George J. Houle, a dealer who bought 30 items at the auction, including letters 
written to Winchell by composer Irving Berlin, remembered his days as a child 
when Winchell's radio-worn greeting "Good Morning Mr. and Mrs. America" sent 
electricity through the air. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very important in his day, but today he's somewhat forgotten," Houle 
said. "No one really collects Winchell. They collect the people around him." 
</P>
<P>
Winchell's loss of stature is not surprising, said author Neal Gabler, who is 
currently writing a book about the culture and evolution of gossip in America, 
in which Winchell was a key player. 
</P>
<P>
"Winchell would understand perfectly," said Gabler, who bought bound copies of 
Winchell's columns from the New York Daily Mirror and radio broadcast scripts 
that were offered at the auction. "Winchell could make or break celebrities. 
But he was also (an example) of how fleeting fame is."

THEY WILL RESULT IN 47 FEWER FIREFIGHTERS ON DUTY EACH DAY AND INCREASE RISKS.

<P>
Faced with an $11-million budget shortfall, Los Angeles County Fire Chief P. 
Michael Freeman has ordered a fire station in the San Fernando Valley closed, 
instituted a hiring freeze and plans to eliminate 60 non-firefighter jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The cost-cutting measures, most of which are scheduled to go into effect early 
next year, will result in 47 fewer firefighters on duty each day, three instead 
of four fighters assigned to each engine, increased structure damage at some 
fires and greater physical risks to those battling blazes, Freeman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Firefighting is very time critical and labor intensive," he said. "With fewer 
firefighters, it's going to take longer to get the job done. And a fire 
company's effectiveness is going to be lower in many cases." 
</P>
<P>
The budget shortfall, Freeman said, is the result of a number of factors -- 
including lower than expected tax revenues, higher gasoline prices and the 
elimination last spring of a labor contract provision that, in some cases, 
allowed his department to avoid paying firefighters time and a half for 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we requested a $275-million allocation and got only $260 million," 
Freeman said, "so we were $15 million short to start with." 
</P>
<P>
The fire chief said he alerted the County Board of Supervisors to the belt 
tightening in a Dec. 7 memo. Letters outlining the changes were sent to 
officials in the 48 cities that contract with the department, which also serves 
unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
County Fire Station 75 in the Chatsworth area is scheduled for closure March 1. 
Freeman said fire service in the area will be taken over by the Los Angeles 
City Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no layoffs among firefighters, Freeman said, but more than 120 
vacancies that now exist will not be filled and attrition will be allowed to 
take its course until a total of 141 positions are eliminated. The department 
currently employs 2,467 firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
The elimination of 60 temporary positions for so-called fire suppression aides, 
workers who clear brush and cut fire lines, is scheduled for Jan. 1. Freeman 
said other workers, including inmate laborers, will be able to replace those 
who get pink slips. 
</P>
<P>
To compensate for the reduced firefighter force, he said, additional engine 
companies will be sent to large fires. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana said that no cuts are planned in other county 
departments. But, he predicted, "Things are going to get worse if rumors of a 
$4-billion deficit (in the state budget) are true." 
</P>
<P>
Dana, a member of the board's conservative majority that has shielded the Fire 
and Sheriff's departments from cuts in past years, said there is no money 
available to prevent the latest reductions. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that he and fellow conservative Supervisor Mike Antonovich 
recently voted to levy new taxes in unincorporated areas to avert cuts in 
mental health. 
</P>
<P>
"When Deane Dana and Mike Antonovich vote for taxes, you know things are down 
to the bottom of the barrel," Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said he is considering presenting the board with a proposal for a 
"benefit assessment" for the department. 
</P>
<P>
Dana, however, said he does not support a property tax increase to support the 
Fire Department. The last time the Fire Department tax was proposed, he said, 
"we had small riots in the board room." 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate that there will be an increase in structural fire loss" because 
of the cutbacks, Freeman said.

DRIFTER FOUND GUILTY OF THREATENING ACTRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Scottish drifter who stabbed Theresa Saldana nearly to death was convicted 
Wednesday of mailing death threats on the actress while serving time for the 
1982 attack. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Richard Jackson, 55, was found guilty in Los Angeles Superior Court on 
five counts of threatening a witness. He is the first person to be convicted 
under a 2-year-old state law that Saldana supported prohibiting felons from 
threatening witnesses or victims in their cases. 
</P>
<P>
He faces 11 more years in prison when he is sentenced Jan. 8, and perhaps more 
if he is judged mentally unstable, prosecutors said. Saldana sighed with relief 
when the verdict was announced and hugged friends as Jackson was led back to 
his holding cell in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
"My initial reaction to this verdict is, 'Yaaaaaayyy,' " she shrieked at a 
courthouse news conference. "I'm very, very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, stabbed Saldana three times in 
the chest and in the arms and legs March 15, 1982. He was convicted later that 
year of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Before the attack, he stalked Saldana under the belief that he was on a divine 
mission, according to psychiatric testimony at his first trial. 
</P>
<P>
While in prison, Jackson began mailing letters threatening Saldana to 
television talk-show host Geraldo Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner called Jackson a "homicidal maniac" 
who is bent on killing Saldana. 
</P>
<P>
"He tried to kill her, did his time and was readying to try again," Reiner said 
at the news conference. "A man with that mental state should never see the 
light of day." 
</P>
<P>
Saldana praised Reiner for standing by her during the years she spent trying to 
bring national attention to Jackson's threats. Her work, Reiner said, produced 
the law under which Jackson was convicted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Gruber, who prosecuted the case, said the statute will 
be a powerful weapon in the war on gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"This law is designed to prevent terror," said Gruber. "It will flood over into 
the gang crimes because they often threaten victims from prison too." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Norman Kava said he will appeal the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson also faces a murder charge in England that stems from a London bank 
robbery in the 1960s. He has confessed to the slaying, but prosecutors are 
unsure whether he will be deported to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
Saldana, who appeared in the film "Raging Bull," said she is afraid that 
Jackson will hunt her down again if he is returned to England.

PROFESSIONAL FANTASIES

When it comes to food fantasies, nobody knows more than a good caterer. 
Fantasy, after all, is what the business is about. We asked local caterers to 
tell us their favorite fantasies. Here are their replies: 
</P>
<P>
Picture a flying carpet, a fake camel, big brass urns and tall palms. Add a 
bustling marketplace complete with vendors carrying food baskets and belly 
dancers roaming about. "We took over a client's tennis court and turned it into 
a Moroccan scene," says Cathee Hickok, event coordinator for Rococo Custom 
Catering Service, Van Nuys. "It was a surprise birthday party for the husband 
whose birthday was six months away. He couldn't speak for about an hour after 
he entered the scene." 
</P>
<P>
The whole place was decorated in shimmering tones of burgundy and blue. Guests, 
dressed to match the theme, sat on crushed velvet pillows with tassels eating 
their food from low brass tables. The Moroccan menu featured bastilla, dried 
fruits and lamb on skewers. 
</P>
<P>
But Hickok is now thinking about another booking -- still a year away. It will 
be a Murphy's law party with everything designed to go wrong. On Hickok's 
agenda: "an incorrectly set table, staged fighting guests, chipped china . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Debra Stevenson, of Los Angeles Party Designs, is so fond of all-white parties 
that she has done them both indoors and out. For a lawn party she used yards 
and yards of white tulle, giant white Casablanca lilies, full-blown white roses 
and big white orchids. Her indoor white night was a glittery white Christmas 
affair. The chairs were draped in white, the tables were covered with mirrors, 
and white satin was loosely draped from ceilings to wall. The sole note of 
color: metallic touches of gold confetti, ribbons and tiny gold gift boxes, 
strewn on each table. The food was all-white as well, from cream soup to white 
chocolate cake. 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson says that lighting is crucial for this sort of party. "Do it in soft 
pink otherwise everyone will look pale, especially in photographs." 
</P>
<P>
Don Ernstein of Wonderful Parties, Wonderful Foods in Culver City came up with 
an all-copper party, an incredible dessert feast -- and a party he created for 
a woman who is passionate about roses. He sent invitations in heart-shaped 
boxes covered with stickers of old Victorian roses and filled with a potpourri 
of dried rose petals. The house was filled with roses, rose chintz tablecloths 
and tree roses. For dessert: floating island made of meringue floating in rose 
petals with a rose-flavored creme anglaise. 
</P>
<P>
John Lavine of the Wonderful World of Fantasy, Los Angeles, calls himself the 
"dream merchant." He has transformed a home into King Tut's tomb (complete with 
a live black panther), served lox aboard a blimp, and recreated a '40s casino 
at the Spruce Goose. His most recent exploit was taking the crew of "Cheers" 
back to the 1890s at the Gene Autry Museum. 
</P>
<P>
But his most popular theme is the jail party. He recreates a Tijuana prison, 
complete with federales and fighting bandits. The food is Mexican. "Brought in 
by prison buses, people walk in and get shocked out of their minds," he says, 
"when they leave, they're talking to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
And people pay for this? 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago Julie and Michael Loshin of Parties Plus created a pre-Castro 
Havana nightclub for a client's 50th birthday. He liked it so well that last 
year he asked them to do another fantasy night. "We were bound and determined 
to blow him away with an authentic Brazilian celebration," they say. 
</P>
<P>
They brought in green bananas on the stalk from South America, they hollowed 
out gourds, fruits and squashes to use as food containers and built barbecues 
out of river rock. The food featured an amazing array of whole fresh fish and 
shrimp, black bean cakes cooked to order and marinated legs of pork. Desserts 
included everything from passion fruit cheesecake to a waterfall of fresh 
tropical fruits. And they served it all in a tent draped in yards of yellow, 
orange and hot pink satin filled with swaying tropical plants, palm trees and 
birds of paradise lit with vivid fluorescent colors. 
</P>
<P>
John Steimetz, director of catering, Westin Bonaventure (and president of the 
National Assn. of Catering Executives) recently recreated a casino for a 
benefit dinner. "We created a set that made you feel like you were walking down 
Bourbon Street," Steimetz says. "We served mini muffaletas, crawfish, stuffed 
deviled clams, Creole sausages, Cajun popcorn, shrimp gumbo, catfish fingers, 
duck and shrimp jambalaya, blackened tenderloin with chile salsa, lots of fresh 
oysters and other seafoods." 
</P>
<P>
Next month, Steinmetz is planning a contest for party planners: each will have 
20 minutes to come up with a fantasy party theme complete with menus. "The 
whole idea is to see how good we can come out with possible future themes," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Ernstein of Wonderful Parties, Wonderful Foods likes to serve this 
chocolate loaf with hazelnuts and orange-liqueur for his dessert parties. The 
flavor will depend on the the type of chocolate and butter cookies used. 
"Pepperidge Farm Chessman cookies are excellent for this recipe, which was 
inspired by Judith Olney, a most creative cook," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT TERRINE 
</P>
<P>
1 cup hazelnuts 
</P>
<P>
9 ounces semisweet chocolate, cut up 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
6 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder 
</P>
<P>
9 ounces unsalted butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 tablespoons Grand Marnier 
</P>
<P>
1 extra large egg 
</P>
<P>
3 egg yolks 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup raisins, plumped and well-drained 
</P>
<P>
11 ounces butter cookies, broken into 1/2-inch bits 
</P>
<P>
Toast hazelnuts in 350-degree oven until they begin to color. Remove and wrap 
in towel. Rub vigorously to remove as much skin as possible. Melt chocolate in 
microwave oven or in double boiler. Combine sugar and water in saucepan over 
low heat. Stir until sugar is melted and mixture is clear. 
</P>
<P>
Beat cocoa and softened butter in bowl until perfectly smooth. Stir in sugar 
syrup, melted chocolate and Grand Marnier. Add egg and egg yolks and mix well. 
Fold in raisins, hazelnuts and cookies. Line 6-cup loaf pan with 2 layers 
plastic wrap, allowing paper to extend beyond ends. Press mixture into prepared 
pan and refrigerate several hours or until set. 
</P>
<P>
To serve unmold by pulling plastic up and out. Invert loaf and lightly sieve 
cocoa powder over top. Cut into thin slices. Makes 12 to 15 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and 
recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. Commercial egg substitutes may be 
used in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances. Check egg substitute 
package for applications.

BACK TO BASICS: DON'T BE AFRAID: IT'S SIMPLY PERFECT CHOCOLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alice Medrich feels uneasy. She's concerned the elegant photographs in her book 
"Cocolat" (Warner Books, 1990: $35) will intimidate people. "I don't want them 
to see the desserts as so perfect they think they could never do that, because 
they can with my help." 
</P>
<P>
Take the marbled glaze pictured on her version of Queen of Sheba cake, for 
example. At first glance it's hard to fathom the technique used to create this 
effect, but Medrich's instructions in the chapter on finishing techniques 
reveal it's really very easy. She demonstrated this procedure along with two 
others on a recent visit to The Times Test Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Most chocolate tortes rise like a souffle while baking, then fall in the center 
as they cool, explained Medrich. Because of this, the cakes must be leveled 
prior to glazing. Before removing the torte from the pan, run a small metal 
spatula between the cake and pan sides, then simply press the raised edges down 
with your fingertips (Step 1) until they are level with the center. 
</P>
<P>
Place a cardboard circle on the torte, release the sides of the springform pan 
and invert the torte so the bottom becomes the top. Remove the pan bottom and 
the paper lining (Step 2). If the cake is still uneven, level it again by 
pressing the top firmly with the bottom of the empty cake pan. 
</P>
<P>
These tortes may be served plain, but they can also be decorated with a variety 
of techniques -- most of which are interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
Medrich suggests using stencils as one easy way to finish a dessert. Powdered 
sugar, cocoa, ground cinnamon, pulverized nuts or grated chocolate make good 
dusting materials, alone or in combination. 
</P>
<P>
Doilies are often used as stencils, but Medrich also includes directions for 
making custom designs. In the section of additional tips, she recommends using 
a very fine strainer and gently tapping it on the side (Step 3) to control how 
heavy the dusting material falls. The stencil must be carefully removed (Step 
4) so as not to smudge the design. 
</P>
<P>
When cakes are to be finished with a glaze, they must first be crumb-coated. 
This is a thin layer of cooled chocolate glaze spread over the torte (Step 5) 
to smooth the surface, fill cracks and "glue" on loose crumbs. The crumb coat 
will not be glossy or attractive, warns Medrich, but it provides a smooth, even 
undercoat for the final glaze. 
</P>
<P>
Refrigerate the torte about 10 minutes, or just until the crumb coat is set. If 
the coating becomes too cold, it will dull the final glaze. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rewarm the remaining glaze in a barely simmering water bath for a 
few seconds, stirring gently until the glaze is perfectly smooth. It should be 
between 90 and 92 degrees and the consistency of heavy cream. 
</P>
<P>
Center the crumb-coated torte on a platter or turntable. Have ready a clean, 
dry metal icing spatula. Pour all the glaze in the center of the top of the 
torte (Step 6). Working quickly, use two or three spatula strokes to spread the 
glaze over the top and let it run down over the sides (Step 7). Turn the 
platter or turntable as you spread the glaze. 
</P>
<P>
Use the spatula to scoop up excess glaze and cover any bare spots on the sides. 
Jiggle or rap the turntable gently to settle uneven glaze or spatula tracks. Do 
not respread or resmooth once the glaze has started to set or the finished 
torte will show spatula marks and dull streaks. 
</P>
<P>
Once the torte is glazed, slide a wide spatula underneath and remove it to a 
rack to dry at room temperature. Keep the torte as level as possible while 
lifting and transferring so the wet glaze on top doesn't shift before setting. 
The glaze will set in 10 to 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Marbling the top requires some advance preparation so it can be done quickly, 
before the glaze sets. Melt one ounce of white chocolate and one ounce of milk 
chocolate in small bowls in a barely simmering water bath. Place each in a 
small paper cone. 
</P>
<P>
Snip the tips of the cones with a sharp pair of scissors to make a small 
opening, just large enough to allow the chocolate to flow when the cone is 
squeezed. Have a fine artist's brush or a thin wooden skewer handy. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the torte is glazed, pipe loose loopy scribble over the cake (Step 
8). Both colors may be done at the same time, or pipe first with milk chocolate 
and then overlap with white chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Using a series of bisecting strokes, draw the brush across the edges of the 
cake (Step 9), letting each stroke cross over the previous one, continuing 
around the cake and gradually moving in toward the center. Finish the sides by 
pressing on coarsely chopped hazelnuts (Step 10). 
</P>
<P>
For an alternate finishing technique, the melted chocolates can be piped in a 
zigzag pattern. Beginning at the center, pipe five free-form milk chocolate 
figures around the cake, then overlap with five made from white chocolate (Step 
11). 
</P>
<P>
CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT TORTE 
</P>
<P>
6 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate 
</P>
<P>
6 ounces unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
4 eggs, separated 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup ground toasted hazelnuts 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar 
</P>
<P>
Powdered sugar, optional 
</P>
<P>
Bittersweet Chocolate Glaze, optional 
</P>
<P>
1 ounce milk chocolate, optional 
</P>
<P>
1 ounce white chocolate, optional 
</P>
<P>
Toasted chopped hazelnuts, optional 
</P>
<P>
Line bottom of 8-inch round, 3-inch deep springform or round cake pan with 
circle of parchment or wax paper. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Cut chocolate and butter into small pieces and place in small bowl. Melt in 
barely simmering water bath over low heat, stirring occasionally, until 
completely melted. Or, microwave on MEDIUM (50% power) about 2 minutes. Stir 
until smooth and completely melted. 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg yolks with 1/2 cup granulated sugar until pale and thick. Stir in warm 
chocolate mixture, ground nuts and flour. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg whites and cream of tartar at medium speed until soft peaks form. 
Gradually sprinkle in remaining 1/4 cup granulated sugar, beating at high speed 
until stiff but not dry. 
</P>
<P>
Fold 1/4 egg whites into chocolate batter to lighten, then quickly fold in 
remaining whites. Turn mixture into prepared pan. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 375 degrees 40 to 45 minutes, or until wood pick inserted in center 
shows moist crumbs. (Torte will rise like souffle during baking, but will fall 
in center while cooling, leaving faintly crusty higher rim around edges.) Cool 
torte completely in pan on wire rack. 
</P>
<P>
Level torte before removing from pan by running small metal spatula or knife 
between edges of torte and sides of pan. Press raised edges of torte down with 
fingers until level with center. 
</P>
<P>
Place cardboard cake circle on torte (release sides of springform pan, if 
used). Invert torte so bottom becomes top, then remove pan bottom and paper 
liner. 
</P>
<P>
If torte is still uneven or appears slightly sunken in center, level again by 
pressing top firmly with bottom of empty cake pan. (Torte may be prepared to 
this point up to 3 days in advance. Wrap well and store at room temperature or 
freeze up to 3 months. Bring to room temperature before serving, glazing or 
decorating.) Makes 10 to 12 servings. 
</P>
<P>
To Stencil Torte: Place desired stencil over top of unglazed cake. Place 
powdered sugar in very fine sieve and hold few inches above stencil. Gently tap 
side of sieve, moving over stencil until entirely covered. Carefully remove 
stencil. 
</P>
<P>
To Glaze Torte: Use metal icing spatula to spread about 1/4 Bittersweet 
Chocolate Glaze in thin layer over top and sides of torte. Smooth rough surface 
of torte, securing loose crumbs and filling any cracks. (Crumb coat will not be 
glossy or attractive. Sole purpose is to provide smooth, even undercoat for 
final glaze. Use care not to get any crumbs in remaining glaze.) 
</P>
<P>
Refrigerate torte about 10 minutes, just until crumb coat is set. Do not chill 
more than 10 minutes, however, or torte will become cold throughout and dull 
final glaze. 
</P>
<P>
Rewarm remaining cooled glaze by placing bowl in barely simmering water bath 
few seconds, stirring gently until glaze is perfectly smooth, 90 to 92 degrees, 
and consistency of whipping cream. Do not overheat. 
</P>
<P>
If glaze is accidentally overheated, cool again to proper temperature before 
using. If there are any crumbs or air bubbles in glaze, pour through fine 
strainer just before using. 
</P>
<P>
Center crumb-coated torte on platter or turntable. Have ready clean, dry metal 
icing spatula. Pour all of glaze in center of top of torte. Working quickly, 
use 2 to 3 spatula strokes so glaze spreads over top of torte and runs down all 
sides. Turn platter or turntable as glaze is spread. 
</P>
<P>
Use spatula to scoop up excess glaze and cover any bare spots. Jiggle or rap 
turntable gently to settle uneven glaze or spatula tracks. Do not respread or 
resmooth once glaze has started to set, or finished torte will show spatula 
marks and dull streaks. 
</P>
<P>
Bittersweet Chocolate Glaze 
</P>
<P>
6 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon light corn syrup 
</P>
<P>
Cut chocolate and butter into pieces. Place in small bowl along with corn 
syrup. Melt gently in water bath over low heat, stirring frequently, until 
almost completely melted. 
</P>
<P>
Remove glaze from water bath and set aside to finish melting, stirring once or 
twice until glaze is perfectly smooth. Or, melt in microwave on MEDIUM (50% 
power) about 2 minutes. Stir mixture gently with spatula or wooden spoon until 
completely smooth. Do not whisk or beat. 
</P>
<P>
Cool glaze, without stirring, until nearly set and consistency of easily 
spreadable frosting.

GOOD COOKING: MAKE YOUR HOLIDAY INDULGENCE BITTERSWEET 
</P>

Even with the current emphasis on health and fitness, the mere mention of 
chocolate makes most people extremely hungry. It is the just reward for going 
that extra mile, the special indulgence that eases any other food sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
And since holiday celebrations make extravagance acceptable, there's every 
reason to make that extravagance chocolate. The following desserts reinforce 
chocolate's finest features: its seductive smoothness, its richness and its 
deep, dark, satisfying flavor. All do-aheads, each chocolate recipe makes an 
elegant presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The chocolate mille-feuille is the quickest and easiest to prepare with a 1-2-3 
last-minute assembly. The glazed frozen fudge cake is served partially frozen, 
making it a refreshing dessert. The chocolate pecan torte with strawberry 
butter cream is a show-stopper on a dessert buffet table in both appearance and 
taste. 
</P>
<P>
While most of your guests are sure to go for the chocolate, it's still a good 
idea to serve fresh fruit alongside. Berries are the most versatile choice, and 
they make a delicious complement to chocolate. Fresh orange segments in a light 
syrup work well with chocolate, too. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a wonderfully easy dessert that satisfies chocolate cravings without 
being too rich. The thinnest sheets of chocolate are used as puff pastry; they 
are cut into rectangles to resemble Napoleons or into any other shape that fits 
your fancy. (Cookie cutters offer a wide range of holiday shapes.) Use them to 
loosely sandwich raspberry sorbet, ice cream or frozen yogurt. Obviously, many 
other flavors would work well too. Arranged on a dessert plate sauced with 
raspberry sauce and dotted with fresh raspberries, the presentation belies its 
ease. Easily doubled or tripled, the chocolate mille-feuilles keep well in the 
refrigerator or freezer. 
</P>
<P>
CHOCOLATE MILLE-FEUILLE WITH RASPBERRY SORBET AND FRESH RASPBERRIES 
</P>
<P>
4 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons oil 
</P>
<P>
1 (10-ounce) package frozen raspberries, thawed, pureed and strained, chilled 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon raspberry liqueur, optional 
</P>
<P>
1 pint raspberry sorbet, ice cream, or frozen yogurt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pint raspberries 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
Grease baking sheet and line with parchment paper. (It's important that paper 
stay flat. Weight at corners, if necessary.) Use pencil to trace 9x7-inch 
rectangle. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Melt chocolate and oil in double boiler over gently simmering water or in 
microwave oven in microwaveable dish on (MEDIUM-HIGH) 75% power. Stir just 
until smooth. Pour into center of rectangle. Quickly spread chocolate with 
small rubber spatula to fill rectangle. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Use pizza cutter to cut vertically in half. Then cut each half crosswise into 4 
equal rectangular pieces (about 3 1/2x2 1/4 inches). Or cut chocolate into any 
other desired shapes. Carefully peel pieces off paper and transfer to airtight 
tin, placing wax paper between pieces. Refrigerate or freeze. Use thawed but 
chilled. 
</P>
<P>
To assemble, combine pureed raspberries with liqueur. Swirl enough raspberry 
sauce on dessert plate to coat. Let sorbet soften. Center plate with chocolate. 
Arrange scoop as desired. Top loosely with another chocolate piece at angle. 
Dust lightly with powdered sugar. Arrange raspberries on sauce. Serve 
immediately. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, dense, fudge-like layers are filled with cocoa-flavored whipped cream. 
Topped with a velvety glaze, it's a chocolate dessert that appeals to all ages. 
</P>
<P>
GLAZED FROZEN FUDGE CAKE 
</P>
<P>
16 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
5 eggs 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
Cream Filling 
</P>
<P>
Glaze 
</P>
<P>
Grease 2 (9-inch) layer cake pans. Line bottom of pans with circle of parchment 
paper. Grease paper. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Melt chocolate and butter in top of double boiler over gently simmering water 
or in microwave in microwave-safe dish at 75% power. Transfer to large mixing 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, beat eggs, sugar and salt in electric mixer until very thick, fluffy 
and tripled in volume, about 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Stir flour and vanilla into chocolate mixture. Add 1/4 whipped mixture. Stir 
well to combine. Fold in remaining whipped mixture. Divide batter between 
prepared pans. Bang pans on counter to settle batter. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 400 degrees on center oven rack until wood pick inserted into center 
comes out fudgy but not wet, about 8 to 9 minutes, rotating pans midway if they 
appear to be baking unevenly. Surface will be slightly cracked. Let cool in 
pans on wire rack. When completely cool, use flexible knife to separate cake 
from sides of pan and gently invert onto rack. Remove paper. (Layers can be 
frozen up to 3 months, wrapped airtight.) 
</P>
<P>
Spread Cream Filling on bottom layer. Top with remaining layer, smooth side up. 
Place in freezer. Once frozen, wrap airtight. Can be frozen as long as 3 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Pour Glaze over top of cake. Spread most on top with thin coating on sides. Can 
be frozen as long as 3 days, once glazed, wrapped airtight after it is frozen 
solid. 
</P>
<P>
To serve, let stand in refrigerator 1 hour until semi-frozen. Use serrated 
knife to cut into serving pieces. Makes 10 to 14 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Cream Filling 
</P>
<P>
1 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons cocoa powder 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
Combine cream, cocoa and sugar. Place in refrigerator 1 hour. Use mixer to whip 
until thick. 
</P>
<P>
Glaze 
</P>
<P>
6 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
Melt chocolate and butter in double boiler over gently simmering water or in 
microwave oven in microwave-safe dish at 75% power. Stir in vanilla. Place in 
refrigerator just until slightly thickened but still flowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chocolate makes this torte extremely rich, moist and dense. Strawberry butter 
cream is spread between the layers, and a thin chocolate glaze coats the 
surface. The chocolate-dipped strawberries garnish the top. Fortunately for 
those with a lot of last-minute shopping, its flavor is greatly enhanced when 
made in advance and refrigerated. Fresh strawberries and raspberries, tossed in 
a little sugar and raspberry liqueur, make a great accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
CHOCOLATE-PECAN TORTE WITH STRAWBERRY BUTTER CREAM 
</P>
<P>
12 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate 
</P>
<P>
2 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
8 eggs 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
3 1/2 cups pecans, very finely ground in food processor 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry Butter Cream 
</P>
<P>
Chocolate Glaze 
</P>
<P>
8 medium strawberries, with tops 
</P>
<P>
Butter 4 (9-inch) round cake pans and fit bottoms with rounds of parchment 
paper. Butter paper. Or, use 2 (9-inch) round cake pans, but bake layers in 
sequence. 
</P>
<P>
Melt chocolate in top of double boiler over gently simmering water or in 
microwave oven in microwave safe dish on 75% power. 
</P>
<P>
Use mixer or food processor to cream sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla and salt 
until fluffy. Stir in chocolate and pecans until combined. Divide batter 
between pans. If baking layers in sequence, leave batter at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 375 degrees on 2 center oven racks until wood pick inserted in center 
comes out fudgy but not wet, about 22 minutes. Reverse pans on rack if they 
appear to be baking unevenly. There will be cracks on top. Cool in pans 5 
minutes. Use flexible spatula or knife to loosen torte from sides of pan. 
Gently invert onto cooling rack. Peel off paper and cool completely. Layers may 
be wrapped separately in plastic bags and refrigerated 2 days or frozen for as 
long as 3 months. If frozen, bring to room temperature while still wrapped. 
</P>
<P>
To assemble, place 1 torte layer bottom-side-up on cake plate. Work 4 strips of 
wax paper under torte to protect plate. Spread generous 2/3 cup Strawberry 
Butter Cream evenly over surface. Carefully set another layer, bottom side up, 
on top and spread with same amount of butter cream. Repeat with 1 more layer. 
Top with fourth layer, bottom side up. Refrigerate overnight to set. Once 
chilled and firm, use hands to gently compress layers to make them uniformly 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
To finish, pour Chocolate Glaze over cake, allowing to drip down sides. With 
long icing knife or spatula, spread smoothly over top, then sides. Split 8 
strawberries lengthwise. Holding end with greens, dip strawberries into 
remaining Glaze to coat bottom 2/3 of each. Place strawberries at equal 
intervals around edge of torte, with hulls on edge and strawberries pointing 
inward. Refrigerate cake and any remaining Glaze at least 4 hours or as long as 
1 day. Use remaining Glaze on sides of torte, if desired. 
</P>
<P>
To serve, let stand at room temperature 1 hour. Cut into very thin slices. 
Makes 16 to 20 servings. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups unsalted butter, softened, cut into tablespoons 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
3 to 4 tablespoons sour cream 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup pureed strawberries 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons strawberry preserves 
</P>
<P>
Use mixer or food processor to cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. 
Add 3 tablespoons sour cream, pureed strawberries and preserves. Mix until 
smooth, at least 1 minute. Add remaining sour cream, if needed, for 
consistency. Makes about 2 1/8 cups. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
3 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate 
</P>

<P>
Here's a great gift for chocoholics on your Christmas list who are convinced 
they have tasted every chocolate treat on the market. Furthermore, all proceeds 
benefit the Down's Syndrome Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey Susans, a dry chocolate cookie mix, requires only a stick of butter and 
an egg; the batter bakes into 8-9 dozen delicate paper-thin chocolate cookies. 
And luckily, for such a yield, the batter holds in the refrigerator or freezer 
for those who prefer baking small batches at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
The recipe, which makes a perfect stocking stuffer or hostess gift, was 
developed by Sue Zelickson, a Minneapolis food writer. The cost is $5 per 
package; a minimum mail order is two packages plus shipping. Payment can be 
made by check, money order, Visa or MasterCard. Call 1(800) 773-6663 for 
further information or write Canterbury Cuisine, Box 2271, Redmond, Wash.

DEUKMEJIAN LOOKS AHEAD TO PRIVACY IN RETURN HOME; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNOR: HE EXPECTS TO SLIDE INTO PRIVATE LIFE IN LONG BEACH 'VERY EASILY, 
VERY EASILY.' 
</P>

SACRAMENTO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even before he officially gives up his job next month, Gov. George Deukmejian 
is packing his bags to return home to his quiet seaside neighborhood in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Once he's home, Republican Deukmejian will be able to drop by his favorite 
Belmont Shore barbershop, listen to a Sunday sermon at All Saints Episcopal 
Church or maybe even savor a sunset without being distracted by the state 
budget crisis or political tiffs with Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to being able to have a little more privacy, a little more 
freedom and some new challenges," Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gore, Deukmejian's press secretary, said the governor is exploring 
several career options, including joining a law firm or a corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's friends say the 62-year-old governor may face an immediate 
adjustment in giving up the trappings of power. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to have people picking him up and driving him to the airport," 
said Al Taucher, a Long Beach resident whom Deukmejian appointed to the State 
Fish and Game Commission. "But I don't imagine he'll miss all the controversy." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, after eight years as leader of the nation's most populous state, a 
smiling Deukmejian chuckled in a recent interview that he expects to slide into 
private life in Long Beach "very easily, very easily." 
</P>
<P>
"That's our home," he said. "Our family is there and our friends are there." 
</P>
<P>
His three grown children were raised in Long Beach. Deukmejian said he and his 
wife, Gloria, are "looking forward" to leading a less public life. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the Deukmejians are having their Long Beach house painted. They plan 
to settle in before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's ties to Long Beach are deeply rooted. Deukmejian, who was born in 
a village on the outskirts of Albany, N.Y., settled in Long Beach in 1958, 
practicing law and getting involved in community affairs, which served as his 
springboard to politics. Among other things, Deukmejian was active in the Lions 
Club, Community Chest and the Boy Scouts. In 1959, he was Long Beach Man of the 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejians' homecoming and transition into private life is expected to be 
far easier -- and far less chronicled -- than their highly publicized search 
eight years ago for a place to live in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
After his election, Deukmejian sought permission from the Legislature to live 
in the $1.5-million suburban governor's mansion, which former Gov. Edmund G. 
Brown Jr. had refused to use. But the Democratic-controlled Legislature, miffed 
at the governor for varied reasons, dragged its feet and allowed the mansion to 
be sold. 
</P>
<P>
While waiting for a decision, Deukmejian initially lived in the downtown 
Holiday Inn before moving into a high-rise apartment building six blocks from 
the Capitol. He lived in the apartment for about 17 months, commuting to his 
Long Beach home on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the governor said he would find his own housing. His supporters bought 
a home for the Deukmejians in the Wilhaggin area, a 15-minute drive from the 
Capitol, and leased it to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their bumpy landing in Sacramento, Gloria Deukmejian said she has 
"enjoyed it up here, but I think it's time to return" to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
One state official, who asked not to be identified, said he was surprised that 
Deukmejian was returning to Long Beach, citing his longtime ties to the 
capital. Before his 1982 election as governor, Deukmejian served in the 
Legislature for 16 years and as attorney general for another four. 
</P>
<P>
"Long Beach might be billed as his hometown, but he has more friends in 
Sacramento," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian's friends in the seaside community embrace the governor as one 
of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. William Thompson, rector of All Saints Episcopal Church, voiced 
happiness that the governor is coming back and hopes that he will be as "active 
in the congregation as he was before he was elected attorney general." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, a Deukmejian appointee to the Board of Behavorial Science Examiners, 
said the governor "has never struck me as the kind of man who will sit back and 
twiddle his thumbs and do nothing. He'll be involved in something."

SANTA PAWS PRESIDES AT ADOPT-A-PET YULE PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was an unbeatable combination: children, animals, senior citizens and Santa 
all in a party atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was the fifth annual Adopt-a-Pet Party at the Long Beach Animal 
Control Center. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five dogs and cats were given away Saturday to low-income senior citizens 
and underprivileged children who could not otherwise afford to have a pet. 
</P>
<P>
This program is made affordable because the sponsoring agencies, Beach 
Charities and the FHP health maintenance organization, promise a lifetime of 
animal food and veterinarian care to the qualifying adoptive "parents," who in 
turn must promise to provide a home and love. 
</P>
<P>
Helping with the pet distribution was the Beach Charities mascot, dressed as 
Santa Paws, who posed for pictures with the participants. Participants were 
able to choose their pet through coupon requests. 
</P>
<P>
"The response to this program from the community is remarkable," said John 
Gonzales, senior animal control officer. 
</P>
<P>
Over the five-year history of the program, the shelter has given away more than 
600 animals. And Beach Charities continues to support them with funds raised 
from its other charity events.

LANDLORDS TOLD TO STOP DRUG DEALERS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE CITY COUNCIL ORDERS THREE OWNERS TO GET RID OF THE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY 
OR RISK FINES AND TEMPORARY LOSS OF PROPERTY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday ordered three landlords to get rid of drug dealing 
in their central city apartment buildings or risk having the court seize their 
properties for one year and fine them up to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
The council declared the buildings public nuisances, marking the first time 
officials have invoked a new city law that holds landlords and residential 
property owners responsible for drug activities on their property. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, the property owners have a month to evict tenants who 
allegedly buy, sell or use drugs in their buildings. Landlords must also 
prevent people who do not live in their buildings from engaging in drug 
activity on the property. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment buildings discussed at Tuesday's hearing are at 1935 Myrtle Ave., 
127 W. 14th St. and 1620 Gundry Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Police used a new computerized tracking system that links crime statistics to 
street addresses to determine that the 14th Street property has been the site 
of 73 narcotics arrests and 124 emergency calls for help since the first of the 
year. There were 23 narcotics arrests and 74 calls to the 911 telephone 
emergency line at the Gundry Avenue property. Police made 30 arrests and 
fielded 52 calls for help at the Myrtle Avenue site. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said that the landlords were notified of the drug activity on 
their property. They did little about the problem until they were told to 
appear at a council hearing and warned that they faced possible court action, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Robert Shannon said that in such cases, police will mail 
landlords a letter telling them the number of the apartment where any arrests 
took place. Shannon said it would be "obvious" to the landlord who the arrested 
tenant is, and that the tenant should be evicted. Most leases give landlords 
the right to evict any tenant with 30 days' notice, Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
Using the ordinance to crack down on the problems in the three central Long 
Beach apartment buildings was a last resort, according to Councilman Clarence 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Smith exhibited a folder on the properties that was as thick as the yellow 
pages in the telephone book. The reports contained information about drug 
dealing at the Myrtle and Gundry avenues properties for at least a year and for 
two years at 14th Street, he said. "It has been a nightmare for these 
citizens," Smith told the council. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen residents and neighbors of the buildings told councilmen that 
they can't sleep at night because of gunfire, that their children can't play in 
the streets because it is too dangerous, and that they watch drug deals and 
other related crimes from their windows. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like we live in a war zone. My children are prisoners," said Wanda 
Davis, who lives with her husband and four children in a building near the 14th 
Street property. 
</P>
<P>
But the landlords said that they also are victims. Attorney Joseph Shemaria 
said his Myrtle Avenue property is one of a dozen Long Beach properties he owns 
as an investment and that he does the city a service by providing housing to 
low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
Shemaria said he has hired private security guards to patrol his property, 
invested $17,000 to install bars on the windows and make other improvements, 
evicted tenants and even canceled his Thanksgiving vacation to take care of all 
this. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem is nearly gone. "I apologize to the people who have 
had to suffer, but I also am a victim," Shemaria said. "I have been losing a 
fortune in that neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Shemaria said it is unfair to expect landlords to get rid of crime that the 
city and even the federal government can't control. "The intent of the law is 
admirable," he said. "But it won't be a solution. When I clean this building 
up, they'll just go down the street." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Emer, owner of the Gundry Avenue property, said he lives in Orange County 
and was surprised to learn of the arrests. He said that he immediately evicted 
his problem tenants and that there is no longer a problem. 
</P>
<P>
David Gomez, the landlord for the 14th Street property, was the only one to 
deny that his tenants sold drugs. Gomez, who said he owned about 50 buildings 
in Long Beach, claimed that homeless people use his apartment building for 
their drug transactions. He said he would build a chain-link fence around his 
property, but that's about all. "Why should I cry about this? It's not my 
problem. It's the city's problem," he said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Evan Anderson Braude complained that he soon may bring another 
property owned by Gomez to the attention of the council. It has similar 
problems with drug activity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said landlords have to do more than simply collect the rent. "A 
lot of these people are absentee landlords who don't live on the premises and 
don't care about anything except whether their money is coming every month," 
said Deputy City Atty. Shannon. "We're saying they have a responsibility, too."

BELLFLOWER VOTES STRICT SMOKING BAN IN PUBLIC PLACES 
</P>

BELLFLOWER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least two times a week, Gene Tummolo and Howard Murrow head over to Ricci's 
Italian Deli and Restaurant on Bellflower Boulevard and take a seat in the 
darkened restaurant at the rear of the meat counter where owner Lou Galasso and 
his son, Michael, take orders. 
</P>
<P>
The businessmen order the special of the day, joke around with Lou's wife, 
Myrna, who waits tables, and bemoan the latest national crisis. After lunch, if 
the coffee is freshly brewed, they order it black, and then Tummolo lights up a 
Newport menthol and lets his meal settle. 
</P>
<P>
That is the way it has been for the last two years, but this week the City 
Council passed one of the strictest anti-smoking ordinances in Los Angeles 
County, and whether Tummolo and his fellow smokers like it or not, habits are 
about to change. 
</P>
<P>
The council, citing its concern with the effects of secondhand smoke on 
nonsmokers, on Monday voted unanimously to ban smoking in all of the city's 
restaurants and in almost every enclosed space that is open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Council member John Ansdell called smoking "slow poison," and fellow council 
members, none of whom now smoke, labeled the habit "disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency recently listed secondhand smoke as a 
Class-A carcinogen, the agency's top category for cancer-causing agents. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision was met with immediate criticism from Ricci's Galasso 
and the few residents who attended the meeting. Most called it an infringement 
on their personal rights. Restaurant owners said they felt that good customers 
would simply go to neighboring cities where such bans do not exist and where 
they can eat lunch and smoke in peace. 
</P>
<P>
"I seriously feel that if we did have nonsmoking (in restaurants) it would hurt 
business," Galasso told the council. "Cerritos and Lakewood have a lot of real 
nice restaurants. I don't see why Bellflower is doing this when all the other 
communities aren't." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this is a time for Bellflower to be a leader," Mayor Randy Bomgaars told 
Galasso. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ban on cigarette smoking in restaurants, the City Council 
also mandated that hotel and motel owners set aside 10% of their rooms for 
nonsmokers. The ordinance, which is expected to receive final approval by the 
council in January, also mandates that smoking be prohibited in public areas of 
galleries, libraries, museums, video arcades and meeting rooms open to the 
public, among other places. 
</P>
<P>
Employers are required to designate smoking areas in employee work areas, and 
ban it in auditoriums, classrooms and elevators. 
</P>
<P>
Bars, tobacco stores, malls, private offices, private residences and places of 
religious worship have been exempted from the law, which is expected to go into 
effect in February. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Beverly Hills three years ago passed a similar ordinance. It 
created such an uproar among restaurant owners that the City Council there was 
forced to rescind the ordinance 30 days after it was passed, said Jan Bear, a 
Beverly Hills senior plan review engineer. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the Los Angeles City Council considered banning cigarette 
smoking at all of the city's restaurants, but instead decided to explore the 
option of requiring installation of partitions and ventilation systems to 
protect nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
No other Southeast area city council has passed an anti-smoking ordinance that 
is as strict as Bellflower's, and most have no smoking ordinances at all. The 
reaction among Commerce city officials to strict no-smoking laws was typical of 
many: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't anticipate our council ever considering the issue," Commerce City 
Clerk Linda Olivieri said. "It's the feeling here that the council is not a 
censuring body." 
</P>
<P>
The Bellflower City Council was expected to mandate that restaurants set aside 
80% of their seating for nonsmokers, but during the meeting Monday, council 
members decided to "go 100%" and ban smoking in restaurants altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a health issue that overrides personal liberties and profits," said 
Councilman Joseph E. Cvetko, who said he believes that smoking is not only 
unhealthy, but "disgusting" as well. "It's like spitting on people with a stink 
cloud," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Benjamin, president of the Bellflower Chamber of Commerce, said that ever 
since the city staff wrote letters to all the business owners who would be 
affected, he has received many complaints from those who feel such an ordinance 
will hurt business in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Bellflower is supported by sales tax," Benjamin said after the meeting. "My 
main concern is the message that the city is sending to businesses. Are we 
moving to assist our business community or to hinder it? If businesses lose 
money because of this, the city may have cut off the hand that feeds it." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin and others said they felt that the decision on banning smoking should 
be left up to the business owners. 
</P>
<P>
He said that when he was first informed by the city that a strict anti-smoking 
ordinance was being considered, the Chamber of Commerce staff did a quick 
telephone survey of their 19-member board of directors. Twelve of the 19 said 
they opposed such an ordinance, he said. Only four said they supported such a 
strict measure. 
</P>
<P>
Bomgaars said he felt that the council was acting in the best interest of its 
constituents. "If banning smoking is such a big issue," he said, looking out 
into the half-empty council chamber on Monday, "why aren't there more people in 
the audience?" 
</P>
<P>
He said the city staff had mailed about 100 letters to restaurant and hotel and 
motel owners who would be affected by the new ordinance. Only Galasso showed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen White, owner of a popular Mexican restaurant called Magdalena's, said 
he was opposed to the council's initial proposal of setting up an 80% 
nonsmoking section, because it would become a logistical nightmare. Besides, he 
said, his restaurant is so small that it would not matter where anyone smoked, 
the fumes would travel throughout the restaurant. But, he said, he supports an 
all-out ban on smoking in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very willing to go along with it," he said. "This way I'm not the evil 
person (keeping smokers from smoking). It's a city law." 
</P>
<P>
As for faithful Ricci's deli customers: Tummolo has been smoking for 43 years; 
Murrow has not smoked since he was 14 years old when his father, a heavy 
smoker, breathed into a clean white handkerchief and showed him the stain his 
breath left. Both plan to continue patronizing the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"If I like the food, I'll keep going to the restaurant," Tummolo said.

$1.6 MILLION MORE OKD TO REPAIR TRASH INCINERATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach City Council has authorized another $1.6 million in repairs for 
the city's trash-to-energy incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, the council approved a $10-million loan to help repair the 
plant, which has been dogged with problems since it opened in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Resource Recovery Facility on Terminal Island burns 1,380 tons of 
garbage a day from Long Beach, Lakewood and Signal Hill. Equipment malfunctions 
have led to unsafe emissions of toxins from its smokestacks, however. They are 
among a list of 88 problems that have kept the incinerator -- one of only two 
in the county -- from being fully licensed by the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District.

CITY CLERK PLANS TO RETIRE AFTER 33-YEAR CIVIC CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lakewood City Clerk Jack Huntsinger, who has worked for the city for more than 
33 years, announced Tuesday night that he will be retiring Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
After serving in the Navy during the Korean War, Huntsinger started his career 
with the city as Mayfair Park supervisor in 1956, only two years after the city 
was founded. He left the Recreation Department in 1972 to take an 
administrative position with the city and became clerk in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Once he retires, Huntsinger said, he plans to spend more time at his hobby: 
officiating at high school football and basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to visit Japan, where I spent a lot of my time during the 
war," Huntsinger said.

COMPANY WINS 5-YEAR PACT TO BUILD BUS STOP SHELTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A company that promises to build 100 bus stop shelters in Lakewood and pay the 
city $510,000 for the privilege has been given a five-year contract by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Bustop Shelters of California builds bus stop shelters and benches similar to 
the ones in Hollywood that sport large advertising displays. The company also 
promised to reserve 50% of its advertising space for Lakewood businesses to 
buy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best deal we have made in years," Councilman Larry Van Nostran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city will immediately receive a cashier's check for $100,000 as the first 
payment.

FORMER COURTHOUSE WILL BE BOUGHT FOR REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has voted to buy the former Los Angeles County Municipal 
Courthouse in the 8000 block of 3rd Street for $1.13 million. The 1.04-acre 
parcel may be developed into theaters and restaurants as a redevelopment 
project, said Robert Messinger, assistant to City Manager Gerald M. Caton. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors is expected to give final approval to the sale 
later this month, Messinger said. 
</P>
<P>
The city will loan its Redevelopment Agency $4 million from general city funds 
to buy the former courthouse and another property at the southeast corner of 
Lakewood and Firestone boulevards. City redevelopment officials have been 
negotiating for months to buy the second property from the St. George Greek 
Orthodox Church. The tentative selling price is about $3 million but 
negotiations are continuing, Messinger said. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency will eventually pay back the loan from the city with 
property tax revenue.

A SEASON GONE WRONG SHAKES RAM ALLIANCE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF HARMONY, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ROBINSON 
AND THE FRONT OFFICE STRIKES A DISCORDANT NOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They walked together into this, if not hand in hand, at least bonded by a 
shared idea of where they were going and how they were going to get there. 
</P>
<P>
They walked together for seven mainly happy seasons, John Robinson and the 
Rams' front office, and where they walked, victories, canny trades and 
ever-mounting optimism usually followed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after getting to the NFC championship game last season, capping their 
sixth playoff appearance in seven years, Robinson and the front office agreed 
that 1990 should be the crowning year of the era. 
</P>
<P>
They were wrong. Now, the fallout. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being a triumphal parade, 1990 has been a journey into disaster. It 
might prove to be the permanent splintering of the fragile balance between 
Robinson and the front office, headed by Executive Vice President John Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
After seven years of public harmony, criticism leveled at both sides appears to 
have strained the relationship, and Shaw apparently has kept his distance from 
his coach this season, to see how Robinson reacts. Robinson, who hadn't heard 
these whispers before, already has conceded that he might be in trouble and 
could be scanning the league for other possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Robinson has never been too cool under pressure, has he?" one NFC coach said 
Wednesday. "Let's see how he handles this one." 
</P>
<P>
It has all the makings of a power struggle caused by seven years of high hopes 
gone bad. And the question of whether Robinson will coach the Rams in 1991 
suddenly is up in the air -- to be decided by a front office increasingly 
bothered by his actions. 
</P>
<P>
In victory, the front office benignly tolerated -- even encouraged -- 
Robinson's hogging the spotlight, holding court, oftentimes subtly undermining 
management along the way. In victory, Robinson quietly accepted the front 
office's habit of keeping the hard line on player contracts and its insistance 
on control over the draft and other personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
In victory, the tense balance held. But 5-8, the current Ram record, is not 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw has said he and owner Georgia Frontiere will review all aspects of the 
team at the end of the season, has included Robinson in that review and has 
declined to give Robinson a vote of confidence for the remaining year on his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointing football seasons are always the Rorschach tests of sports -- you 
see what you want to see in them. Bad breaks? A pattern of wrong-headed money 
decisions? A talented team tied to a coach who hasn't won the Big One? A team 
that got lucky last season and is paying the price for it now? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever you want to see in this Ram stumble, you see. 
</P>
<P>
But it appears clear that what Shaw and the rest of the Ram administration see 
in Robinson is not quite to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
"If he spent as much time coaching the team as he does running around trying to 
deflect the blame in other directions, we'd have been one of the elite teams 
this year," one executive said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for an example of how Robinson undermines the front office, he offered a 
story. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of last season, the administrator said, Robinson clamored for the 
team to get rid of back-to-back 1,000-yard rusher Greg Bell because he thought 
Bell wasn't his kind of running back and he was sure Cleveland Gary and Curt 
Warner could do just as good a job. 
</P>
<P>
But when Shaw accommodated him, trading Bell to the Raiders and giving the 
since-waived Warner a $700,000 contract, Bell accused the front office of yet 
another salary-inspired banishment at the cost of quality, and said Robinson's 
chances of winning a Super Bowl were being crippled by Shaw's penny-pinching. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the front office say that Robinson, as a way of pulling the public in 
his favor, told Bell it was all a money problem instead of his own problem with 
the player -- knowing that Bell would air it out publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Ram administrators also insist, privately, that the big-money, market-value 
signings of linebacker Kevin Greene and receiver Henry Ellard this season prove 
that they pay for performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams claim they now rank in the top half of league payrolls, possibly in 
the top 10. According to the NFL Players Assn.'s latest salary survey, they 
rank 20th, with a 1990 base payout of $16,659,500. Important fact: the NFLPA's 
survey does not include either Greene's deal, which will pay him about $800,000 
this season, or the half-eaten Warner contract. 
</P>
<P>
It may not really matter how much of the Bell story is true, just that Ram 
executives believe it -- plus a handful of similar stories. 
</P>
<P>
And privately, they wonder if the team would be better off without a coach who 
has his own public relations agenda? Is it worth it if, after eight seasons, 
the team is languishing at the bottom of the NFC? 
</P>
<P>
The Rams understand the value of a coach who is a marvelous -- and for seven 
seasons, the only -- spokesman for the team. Robinson has kept the attention on 
himself and away from where Shaw doesn't want it -- on Shaw. Robinson knows his 
role and plays it well. 
</P>
<P>
But Shaw, who has spoken sporadically with reporters this year, is aware that 
by having Robinson as the team's only spokesman, everything that comes out has 
Robinson's spin, his way of winning over the media. While Robinson has gained 
by being so accessible, the usually unavailable Shaw has been torched. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Robinson declined a request for an interview concerning the 
failings of 1990 and looking ahead to what might come in the off-season, saying 
he wanted to concentrate only on the next three games. Shaw has been 
unavailable for comment the past several days. 
</P>
<P>
But clearly, each of the crisis points of 1990 has served only to heighten the 
tension between the two, pushing Shaw and Robinson in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The defensive decline can be traced to the team's inability to find an 
impact player in the draft, despite having 10 premium choices in two drafts 
after the 1987 midseason trade of Eric Dickerson to the Indianapolis Colts in a 
three-way deal with the Buffalo Bills. The Rams got three No. 1 choices and 
three No. 2s and had four other choices of their own in those two drafts. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of ending up with Michael Dean Perry (whom they bypassed five times 
in 1988) or anybody who could earn a Pro Bowl spot, the Rams drafted six 
defensive players, ranging from disappointments (1989 second-round defensive 
lineman Brian Smith, 1989 first-rounder Bill Hawkins) to solid but 
unspectacular contributors (1989 second-round inside linebacker Frank Stams, 
1988 second-round safety Anthony Newmann). 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' draft hierarchy has always been vague in the public consciousness: 
Does Shaw make the picks, or does player personnel director John Math or does 
Robinson? And no one is stepping up to assume responsibility for this batch. 
</P>
<P>
After this season, it is unlikely that Robinson can gain more of a draft power 
base if he remains, and after Gary's fumbling problems, he might even have 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robinson retooled their basic 3-4 defense this season around the 
expectation that Smith and Hawkins were ready to blossom in the middle of a 
four-man line. But partially because of injuries and holdouts, the defense 
never jelled. 
</P>
<P>
Was the front office to blame for not getting Greene and defensive end Doug 
Reed into camp soon enough? Did Robinson stick with his defense too long when 
he never had the training camp time or the right players to implement it? 
</P>
<P>
Ram coaches now concede that they had hoped for too much, and agree that the 
scrappy defense that got them to the NFC championship game last season was 
working more on fortitude than on talent. Instead of a tuneup, it might have 
been due for some major reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
Then the next question: Would Shaw pay the money it would take to, say, go 
after a high-priced protected free agent, or to wade heavily into the Plan B 
market? 
</P>
<P>
The front office is known to be uncomfortable with the soft zone method used by 
defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur, but without the talent level, it is hard 
to imagine the Rams being any more successful in another defense. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is possible that, as a condition of Robinson's being brought back for 
1991, Shaw could ask him to replace one or more of his defensive assistants -- 
more as one-year scapegoats than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Because of their 26-points-a-game average in 1989, the Rams generally 
assumed that the offense would again score 30 points a game in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But this season, put in similar jams, the offense hasn't been as productive and 
has endured some huge turnovers -- Gary's seven lost fumbles leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw probably is aching to see Gaston Green in a more active role in the 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
So here the Rams stand, wobbly and not so together, after taking seven seasons 
to reach what had appeared to be the brink of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And of the countless things you can see in the ink blots of the Rams' 1990 
season, a calm off-season is not one of them.

JIM MURRAY: ATHLETES ARE ON FRONT LINE IN DRUG FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the United States of America were under attack from a terrible enemy that 
was infiltrating the country through a half-dozen key ports and lining up our 
youth and destroying them systematically, what do you think the national 
response would be? 
</P>
<P>
I'll tell you: The country would be on a total war footing, lights would be 
burning late in Washington, bonds would be being sold, the Pentagon would be on 
red alert and factories would be churning out defense weapons by the boatload. 
Nobody would be counseling surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Well, we are under siege. There is a terrible enemy at the gates. It has gained 
an insidious foothold. It is a greater threat to our country than Communism 
ever was. Hitler would never have gotten on our shores, but this invader 
already is here. 
</P>
<P>
The enemy is a coalition, a combination of deadly forces, and it's winning on 
all fronts. It's an unholy alliance of cocaine, marijuana, codeine, heroin, 
speed and, yes, alcohol. When last seen, it was marching up the coast of 
Florida, it had New York and Los Angeles under siege, it appeared as 
unstoppable as the Wehrmacht -- and a lot of people thought we should give up 
and let it in, i.e., legalize it, naturalize it, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
You can't fight this enemy with tanks and guns. Courts are ineffectual. You 
can't stop to read the rights to a man about to kill you. You can't stop a 
cartel with a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
But we do have the weapon that could turn the tide -- education. This enemy 
cannot function in the light. It strikes in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
That's why a one-hour documentary on ABC Sunday at 4 p.m. PST, titled "Athletes 
and Addiction -- It's Not a Game," is as important a counterattack in this war 
as the Battle of the Bulge was in its. 
</P>
<P>
The brainchild of a network producer, Geoff Mason, a sports specialist who 
knows what he's talking about -- he once went through an entire Wimbledon 
tournament in such an alcoholic blackout he doesn't remember a single lob, he 
acknowledges. An alumnus of the Betty Ford Clinic in Palm Desert, Mason, who 
barely escaped capture and imprisonment in this war, has decided to warn the 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Athletes are the most visible victims in this war. The public will pay 
attention to their sad stories, where commercials showing frying eggs on a 
griddle may miss the point. Says Jim McKay, the sportscaster who wrote and 
narrates the addiction documentary: "They're role models whether they want to 
be or not. What they do, a whole generation of kids copy." 
</P>
<P>
McKay's documentary is a kaleidoscope of sports star addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Sanderson, once the highest-paid hockey player in the world, hits bottom 
when he becomes a derelict in Central Park, trying to steal a bottle of wine 
from another addict and, when being caught, demanding, "Don't you know who I 
am?" and being told devastatingly, "Yeah, I know who you are -- a bum just like 
me." 
</P>
<P>
There's Tai Babilonia, pretty, gifted but terribly lonely and depressed, 
turning to a glass of wine to help her sleep, then a bottle, then a case, then 
a suicide attempt. These people pulled the rip cord just in time, but the show 
addresses the John Matuszaks, too -- star athletes who crashed and died in free 
fall. Or free base. 
</P>
<P>
It also addresses the degree of difficulty in recovery. McKay says: "There's a 
trap in which kids see apparently successful recoveries and say, 'Oh, I see how 
this works. You do coke and then when they catch you, you go away for 28 days, 
rehab, and then come back where you left off none the worse.' Well, it doesn't 
work that way. The chances are you won't do as well. And the recovery rate is 
not 100% -- more like 50%, some say as low as 10%." 
</P>
<P>
McKay adds: "Athletes are treated as something special from childhood. They 
think they are immune to the laws which govern ordinary people. And, to be 
sure, they are encouraged to think so. We tell the story of the coach who finds 
cocaine in the high school kid's locker but does nothing about it because the 
kid's a star, and the coaches who call the rehab center and say, 'When can we 
get Butch back? We need him!' You know, the ordinary addict is warned not to go 
back to the same playgrounds, the same playmates or environment which got him 
into trouble in the first place. But the athlete has to go right back to the 
same locker room, the same stresses." 
</P>
<P>
The documentary shows the plight of the young high school athlete who has been 
at a treatment center for a year, after becoming an addict at 6 when his older 
brothers talked him into smoking pot in the family cellar. In this war, they 
bomb nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
The war is far from won. It isn't even stalemated. The enemy is advancing on 
all fronts. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC documentary is at least an attempt to show our unarmed forces what the 
foe looks like, what to look for -- like those sessions where they showed air 
raid wardens the silhouettes of enemy fighters. 
</P>
<P>
Any war effort requires first-rate intelligence. When you hear -- and see -- 
Chuck Muncie say, "In 1982, I scored 19 touchdowns, an NFL record; in 1989, I 
went to prison for . . . cocaine," you get a better look at the enemy than any 
chart could give. When Steve Howe says, "In 1981, I was on top of the world 
with the world champion Dodgers; in 1983, I walked out on my wife, my newborn 
daughter and my teammates for a line of cocaine," you know he's in division 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
You know you're in a desperate war when the casualties mount up. The Betty Ford 
Center, where much of the documentary was filmed, has treated more than 15,000 
addicts in its eight years. The success rate is high, but the wounded continue 
to pile up nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
This documentary is at least an attempt to put a lantern in the Old North 
Church window, to turn Paul Revere loose. To delay any longer, this might be 
the first war we ever lost in our sleep.

QUARTERBACK HAS GAME, WILL TRAVEL; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: JOHN WALSH BROUGHT SUCCESS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS TRANSFER FROM 
WEST TORRANCE TO CARSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As if high school football had professional baseball's free-agency policy, 
quarterback John Walsh transferred from West Torrance High to Carson last 
spring because Carson had the best showcase for his talents. 
</P>
<P>
It has been an ideal match. Walsh leads the Colts (11-1) into Friday night's 
City 4-A Division championship game against longtime rival Wilmington Banning 
(9-3). With 4,030 passing yards, he broke the state single-season record of 
4,019 yards set by Santiago Alvarez of Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh is 426 yards shy of the national record set last weekend by Donnie Davis 
of Burlington (N.C.) Cummings High. Walsh, who has broken 26 school records, 
has passed for 46 touchdowns and seven times has thrown for more than 300 yards 
in a game. 
</P>
<P>
For Carson, which lost in the 4-A final to Dorsey last season, Walsh's arrival 
has been a blessing. The Colts were expected to be one of the City's top teams 
if they could find a quality replacement for graduated quarterback Armin 
Youngblood. Walsh has more than filled that need. 
</P>
<P>
"He fits right into our scheme of things perfectly, like a puzzle when you put 
it all together," said Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle, who in coaching his last 
game will be going for a record-breaking 10th City title. 
</P>
<P>
"With our short-passing game, he is a natural for it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Walsh: "I thought that I was a pretty good quarterback at West Torrance -- 
maybe not as good as this year because I'm throwing more and I have a little 
more experience." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh might have brought temporary happiness to Carson, but he has raised many 
questions with his transfer. Carson has a history of controversial football 
transfers, the most celebrated involving quarterback Perry Klein in 1988. 
Klein, who transferred from Palisades, led the Colts to a 4-A title but left 
their image tarnished because of his relationship with Steve Clarkson, a former 
Carson assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
Clarkson, a former quarterback with the Denver Broncos and in the Canadian 
Football League, is a quarterback coaching specialist in Southern California 
who has worked privately with Klein and USC's Todd Marinovich. Last spring, 
Clarkson -- who did not coach at Carson last season -- began working with 
Walsh. This connection raised eyebrows after Walsh's transfer. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance administrators complained to the Southern Section regarding 
Walsh's transfer, but the matter was dropped because of lack of evidence. 
However, Dick Mattingly, a Carson assistant principal, would not allow Clarkson 
to coach this season. 
</P>
<P>
"In no way is he on our coaching staff, absolutely not," Mattingly said in 
September. "I don't care what any other coach wants. The principal runs this 
operation, not the coaches. We do not participate in the recruitment of 
athletes from other schools. We want to keep our integrity, and we will 
maintain it." 
</P>
<P>
Clarkson said he has since been asked to rejoin Carson's coaching staff for 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an unwritten rule that if another team files a complaint, it has to be 
investigated," Clarkson said. "West Torrance filed a report, and basically 
nothing substantial was found. The matter was solved before the first game 
against Bishop Amat. I have just never gone public." 
</P>
<P>
Clarkson has been seen on the Colts' sideline this season and admitted he still 
works with Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
"I first came in contact with (Walsh) in 1989 when I was working a prospects 
camp for California Sports," Clarkson said. "I did not hear from him again 
until April 1990, when he called and asked me if I wanted to help out. I see 
him every once in a while now, but I don't help out as much. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a (bad reputation) with the Perry Klein thing. But (Klein) had a history 
of transferring long before he met me. Now, unfortunately, any kid I come in 
contact with, I'm accused of recruiting. To be honest, I expect a quarterback 
to come to Carson every year because of the success Walsh has had. As long as 
Carson has a successful program, they will have this happen. Walsh was just a 
junior college quarterback (prospect) before this season and now look at him." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's living arrangement also has been questioned. His parents are reportedly 
separated, and Walsh lives in a Carson apartment with his father. His brother 
and three sisters live with their mother in Torrance. Walsh has not talked 
about his personal life this season. Last week, when he had his picture taken 
for The Times' South Bay All-Star team, Walsh listed his home address as 
Torrance. There have been rumors that he plans to transfer back to West 
Torrance in the spring to play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't talked about my home life and I'm still not going to," Walsh said. 
"It is my decision not to talk. I'm like any other 18-year-old. I'm lucky to 
have parents like I do." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh did not gain Carson many fans with his transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised when I was first told by him that he was leaving," West 
Torrance co-coach Mark Knox said. "No one had any idea prior to that. . . . He 
had made up his mind before he had talked to me. Everyone makes up their own 
opinions on whether a transfer is legitimate or not. I can't comment on 
anything that I don't know factually." 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw Coach Robert Garrett, against whose team Walsh passed for a 
season-high 470 yards, is a strong opponent of transfer cases such as Walsh's. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it's wrong for the Carson kids," Garrett said. "Say they did have 
a quarterback who was first-team. He would then be put in the back seat. The 
rules say that we should not recruit. But look at Klein and Walsh. It's obvious 
that all kids want to play in a winning program, and the move is to Carson." 
</P>
<P>
Carson defensive back Tarriel Hopper would have been the Colts' starting 
quarterback if Walsh had not transferred. Hopper, a standout safety, said he 
was relieved to see Walsh in a Carson uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"I never wanted to play quarterback," Hopper said. "It was a surprise when I 
heard that he was coming here, but I said, 'Please let it come true.' It was 
his show when he got in school, and I willingly stepped aside. We have a 
wide-open offense that needed the right person behind the controls to set it 
off." 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that Walsh would have been as successful as he has been without 
having five quality receivers. Latario Rachal is the team leader with 55 
catches for 1,252 yards and 21 touchdowns, all school records for a season. He 
is followed by Abdul Muhammad, 52 catches for 833 yards and 10 touchdowns; 
Theron Hill, 45 catches for 727 yards and five touchdowns; Donnell Adams, 24 
catches for 391 yards and six touchdowns; and Fred Sims, 23 catches for 623 
yards and seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a real good supporting cast," Walsh said. "I get (Carson's wideouts) 
the ball, and they run wild with it. Before I came here, I didn't know anything 
about the players. But when I first saw them, I noticed that they were super 
fast and that they could catch. I'm not afraid to throw to any of them." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh has shown the ability throw every type of pass. He has gained praise for 
everything from his screen passes to bombs. Walsh said he will take his college 
recruiting visits to Miami, Brigham Young, Washington and USC. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was first told about him," Vollnogle said, "people told me that he 
can't run and that he was a fair passer. But Walsh has proven that he can do it 
all. He is the best high school passer I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett also is a big fan of Walsh. "He is the best quarterback I've ever had 
the opportunity to see, and I played against Jay Schroeder and John Elway in 
high school. He is a heck of an athlete. He gets the job done. He has a quick 
release and he audibilizes very well. I would put him in a class with Joe 
Montana in five or six years." 
</P>
<P>
If Walsh returns to West Torrance this spring, it would be a move similar to 
Klein's transfer back to Santa Monica after playing at Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had no problems at Carson," Walsh said. "Of course, you miss being with 
people you grew up with. But I like it here at Carson." 
</P>
<P>
However, a move would not shock his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Carson is a good team every year, and there are always different players from 
different teams who want to come to Carson," Muhammad said. "If Walsh did go 
back to West Torrance after football season, I would be a little surprised. But 
I don't know. . . . He has said that he likes Torrance better." 
</P>
<P>
Said Vollnogle: "I don't know if he'll go back to West Torrance. That's his 
decision. But Klein told me that his biggest mistake was leaving Carson after 
his football season."

BETTER-BALANCED BRUINS FACE LSU IN SEMIFINALS

On the surface, little has changed in UCLA women's volleyball. The Bruins have 
reached the final four -- for the 17th time in 20 years -- and for the third 
year in a row, they have done so ranked No. 1 in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But when they play 17th-ranked Louisiana State tonight at College Park, Md., 
the Bruins, who are riding a 31-match winning streak, will be at a critical 
juncture. The final four semifinals have not been kind to UCLA in recent years, 
including the past two in which the Bruins have been unable to win a game. 
</P>
<P>
But this season, the Bruins insist they are a far different team than the one 
that lost to Texas in the 1988 semifinals and to Nebraska last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The last two years, we've always counted on key players, and this year it's 
more of a well-rounded team," senior hitter Samantha Shaver said. "We depend on 
everybody, not just the six out on the court, and even the bench is very 
important." 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Bruins have had a more competitive season than their 34-1 record 
would indicate, coming from behind on several occasions to win matches. That, 
Shaver said, has done wonders for the team. She added: 
</P>
<P>
"Before, we've gone through the Pac-10 and tournaments and killed every team, 
but this year we've been down, and so we know what it's like to be losing, and 
to be down two games and come back to win." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Andy Banachowski said: "They don't have a feeling of invincibility 
about them at all. Maybe the previous teams thought nobody could stay with 
them. And then somebody did, and all of a sudden we got tight." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have had a more balanced attack this season, with a much quicker 
offense set up by Holly McPeak, a transfer from California who has been 
extremely successful in reading the opponents' defense. 
</P>
<P>
But McPeak has plenty of help. There's left-handed sophomore, Natalie Williams, 
who on Wednesday was named a first-team All-American. Hitting opposite Williams 
is Jenny Evans, a second-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
Shaver, who has a UCLA-record 1,380 digs, and Marissa Hatchett consistently 
join Williams and Evans in double figures in kills. 
</P>
<P>
LSU (34-6) is big and powerful, but much slower than the Bruins and not as 
adept at handling the ball. The Tigers, making their first appearance in the 
Final Four, won the South Regional by defeating Texas in five games. 
</P>
<P>
LSU has relied largely on the hitting of first-team All-American Monique Adams, 
first on the team in kills with 596, and Nyla Shepherd in an offense set by a 
Brazilian, Daniela Reis, a second-team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
Should the Bruins break their semifinal jinx, they will play the winner of 
tonight's semifinal match between Pacific (29-6) and Nebraska (32-2).

PAT VALENZUELA'S HEARING BEFORE STEWARDS POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Pat Valenzuela's scheduled hearing Wednesday before the Hollywood Park stewards 
was postponed and no new meeting is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who hasn't ridden since Nov. 2, underwent a medical examination 
last Friday, and the results were to have been sent to the California Horse 
Racing Board, then to the stewards. 
</P>
<P>
But CHRB Executive Secretary Dennis Hutcheson told the stewards the doctor's 
report had not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
According to steward Tom Ward, Hutcheson said the board will schedule a hearing 
with the stewards when all of the documents regarding Valenzuela have been 
received. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, 28, was suspended indefinitely last month after he called in sick 
on Nov. 3 at Santa Anita. Late last year, he was suspended for 60 days after 
testing positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Dorky, making her first start on turf, rallied to beat Saratoga Success and 
favored Assombrie in the $50,450 Althea Stakes Wednesday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-2 third choice, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, won by a nose over Saratoga 
Success, with favored Assombrie another neck back. The time for the 1 1/16 
miles was 1:41 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old filly, owned by Allen Paulson and trained by Richard Lundy, has 
won two of her four starts.

SADLER IS MAN WITH SPEED TO SPARE

<TEXT>
<P>
Meet John Sadler, a young man with horses in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
At 34, he has established himself as a training whiz with thoroughbred 
whirlwinds. One racing reporter has called him, "King of the Sprinters." Since 
the statistics backed up such high praise, Sadler gladly accepted the title. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, Sadler's stable of high-class sprinters has won 10 Southern 
California stakes, set two track records and established several stakes 
records. And all this has been accomplished with something less than the 
blue-blooded, Kentucky-bred bullets typified by Dayjur, the European speed 
demon who came within a vaulted shadow of winning the Breeders' Cup Sprint in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Sadler's front line -- all of them gelded and wearing chestnut red -- consists 
of Valiant Pete, a homegrown Cal-bred; Olympic Prospect, a former claimer; and 
Frost Free, a $50,000 yearling who did not make it to the races until he was 4. 
</P>
<P>
Like a bridge master mulling over a grand slam hand, Sadler will play Cal Cup 
Sprint winner Valiant Pete this Saturday in the Hollywood Turf Express at 
Hollywood Park. But just in case it rains enough to force the race onto the 
main track, Sadler has recent Underwood Handicap winner Frost Free ready to 
roll as well. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Sadler is preparing Olympic Prospect for a third comeback in 
the Palos Verdes Handicap during the first week of the Santa Anita season. The 
son of Northern Jove will turn 7 next year, but with the exception of Phone 
Trick and Chinook Pass, no California-based sprinter of the last decade has 
been more brilliant than Olympic Prospect. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, no top sprinter has spent more time in rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"He's his own worst enemy," Sadler said earlier this week as he reviewed 
Olympic Prospect's career. "He's almost too fast for his own good. I'm 
reasonably certain he can be as good as he ever was. He's never been abused, 
never had a joint injected. But how long he lasts is up to him." 
</P>
<P>
While Olympic Prospect is a hard-nosed old pro with a nasty streak, Valiant 
Pete is a big puppy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a barn pet," Sadler said. "They call him Baby Huey. He's a big guy but 
very sweet. That's why he was gelded as a yearling -- he was so massive that it 
looked like there would be no way he could stand training." 
</P>
<P>
The last time Valiant Pete ran six furlongs on the Hollywood turf course, he 
suffered a minor shin fracture. That was on July 6, 1989. He was sent to the 
farm of owners Pete Valenti and John Coelho to recuperate, then developed a 
severe colic condition. Surgery was required to save his life. 
</P>
<P>
Valiant Pete won four of seven starts before his injury, and since his return 
last June has won twice and been second three times in five tries. Besides the 
Cal Cup Sprint, his most recent race on Nov. 3, Valiant Pete won the Mt. 
Harvard Handicap at the Los Alamitos thoroughbred meeting in August. Blink and 
you missed it. 
</P>
<P>
The race was at 4 1/2 furlongs, a 990-yard dash that took Valiant Pete only 49 
1/5 seconds to run. The world record for the odd distance had been 50 2/5, a 
mark held by nine horses at six tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard about that race, I just drooled," Sadler said. "It was perfect 
for him. Afterward, somebody said that I could have been a great quarter horse 
trainer if I'd gone that route." 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena native seemed destined for the thoroughbreds, however. He rode his 
family's show horses as a teen-ager, then dabbled at college before diving 
head-first into race track life. Sadler groomed horses for trainer Tom Pratt, 
spent 1 1/2 years with Dr. Jack Robbins as a veterinarian's aide, then worked 
as an assistant with trainer Dave Hofmans before taking out his own license and 
heading north to the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
Sadler admitted that he was not an overnight success. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember having to borrow money from my father in '82 to pay the feed man," 
Sadler recalled. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, Sadler was on his way. In 1986, he trained Melair, the 
exciting white filly who upset Preakness winner Snow Chief at Hollywood Park. 
He took Olympic Prospect to the Breeders' Cup Sprint in 1988 and '89. And this 
year, his stable will hit an all-time high of nearly $2 million in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I impatient about getting better horses? Yes and no," Sadler replied. "Like 
a lot of trainers out here, my stock is gradually improving. But I'm not much 
of a heavy self-promoter. I figure if I keep doing well, the good ones will 
come." 
</P>
<P>
Sadler is ambivalent about his "sprint king" reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be known for doing something well, but I don't consider myself 
typecast," he said. "Look at what's been said about some others: Charlie 
Whittingham can train only European turf types -- so he wins two Kentucky 
Derbies. Wayne Lukas can't train for grass -- so he's got a turf champion. I 
think if you can train, you can train."

FOREIGN-BORN, FOREIGN-TRAINED LATINO DOCTORS FRUSTRATED BY BARRIERS TO 
PRACTICING MEDICINE HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What if you're Rigoberto Flores Garcia from Puebla, Mexico, and you have dreams 
of nice homes and new cars? 
</P>
<P>
You come across the border into Southern California with $500 in your pocket 
and start a succession of low-paying jobs. First you scrub pots and pans at a 
Carl's Jr. in Los Angeles. Then you try waiting tables at a Mexican restaurant. 
You switch to flipping burgers for a living. Finally you lose that job. 
</P>
<P>
Typical immigrant pipe dream gone sour? Well, this 34-year-old newcomer happens 
to be Doctor Flores, a licensed Mexican physician who once delivered 12 babies 
in one night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my dream and my mother's dream that I become a physician," Flores said. 
"I didn't know it would be this difficult, or this expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Flores and hundreds of other highly educated Latinos living here -- some 
without legal immigration status -- are finding themselves in economic limbo 
after spending years earning medical degrees. They left Mexico or other Central 
American countries fed up with their governments' chaotic economies and low 
wages, and now they find themselves among Southern California's unemployed or 
underemployed because they lack the language skills and the money to take 
courses and exams necessary to obtain licensing here. 
</P>
<P>
"My God, we keep hearing about the lack of Latino doctors in this country for 
our Spanish-speaking communities and here Flores was washing dishes for a 
living," said Enrique Zuniga, a bilingual counselor at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
Zuniga and counselors from other Southern California colleges are trying to 
create inexpensive English courses for Latino doctors that concentrate on 
medical terminology. 
</P>
<P>
He also helped organize a group called the Consortium of Physicians from Latin 
American, which now includes more than 35 doctors from Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. The group hopes to help raise scholarship money for foreign doctors, 
and help with post-graduate programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We need any kind of help right now," Zuniga said. "Money or leads for jobs 
that some of the doctors can get, such as health assistants, to keep them from 
abandoning their plans." 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Lopez Espana, 33, graduated from the medical school at the University de 
San Carlos in Guatemala, where he was ranked 86th out of 500 students. At the 
Hospital at San Juan de Dios near Guatemala City, he performed appendectomies, 
removed bullets, delivered babies, and conducted autopsies. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he is a health educator handing out brochures and conducting AIDS 
awareness seminars at a Latino community center in Santa Ana. He's one of the 
fortunate -- he has a job in a health-related field. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Sandoval, 33, who practiced two years after graduating from the medical 
school at the University of Morelia in southern Mexico, is now driving a 
vegetable truck for an Anaheim company. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that foreign-trained doctors must climb through a maze of state 
Medical Board restrictions that can take three to five years, and sometimes 
longer, to complete and can cost thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, these doctors, who must support themselves and their families, are 
finding the transition from Third World economy to Southern California's 
full-throttle materialism very tough. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Sandoval earns $7.50 an hour driving a truck. His wife, Carolina, 
who was a third-year medical student in Morelia when they met, later became a 
physician and worked for a company specializing in medical examinations. She 
now works in an Anaheim assembly plant making aircraft parts for $6 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest problem right now is keeping ourselves motivated and learning 
English so that we can fill out the applications for the medical exams and 
become licensed physicians here," Alfonso Sandoval said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple said they took university English courses in Mexico to help prepare 
for the United States, "but the reality of it is, you don't learn everything 
from books. Our English courses were quite different from how English is spoken 
here," said Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no idea it was going to be this tough to live here," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Castillo, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the medical 
school at UC Irvine, said many of the medical newcomers come unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
"They arrive in Southern California with absolutely no orientation about what 
to expect or what they should do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo charged that the medical establishment, by making the licensing 
procedure for foreign doctors so long and difficult and expensive (preparatory 
courses can cost as much as $5,000) is trying to keep newcomers out because 
they fear the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very closed system for doctors in this country," Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
However, officials from the Medical Board of California (formerly the state 
Board of Medical Quality Assurance) disagreed. They contended the board does 
not discriminate, and noted that about one-fourth of the licenses issued last 
year went to foreign-trained doctors. About 25% of the state's 69,000 licensed 
physicians are foreign-trained, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have licensed thousands of foreign medical graduates over the years," said 
Linda McReady, a board spokeswoman. "We look not at languages or where they're 
from, but the medical training they got, and we have doctors from all over the 
world working in California." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, an unsuccessful lawsuit was filed on behalf of Vietnam-trained doctors 
who could not prove they had graduated from the University of Saigon medical 
school after the city fell to the communists in April, 1975. The suit was filed 
by Julianne D'Angelo, supervising attorney for University of San Diego's Center 
for Public Interest Law. 
</P>
<P>
"These people escaped and had no diplomas. They had to take certain courses to 
qualify to become a doctor in this state, but the board didn't allow them 
(because they had no diploma)," said Marcia Gilchrist, a spokeswoman for state 
Sen. Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim). Royce sponsored successful legislation that 
created a task force of former Vietnamese medical school faculty members that 
eventually helped the Vietnamese doctors gain U.S. licenses. 
</P>
<P>
D'Angelo claimed the board's behavior in the Vietnamese issue is indicative of 
its attitude toward all foreign medical graduates -- a criticism that was 
denied by Terresa Ciau, chief of licensing for the Board's Division of 
Licensing. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we fair?" said Ciau, who accepted her Board position after the 1987 
lawsuit. "I think so. Our image hasn't been what it should be but we're working 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I've been here, we've been trying to be more service-oriented," Ciau 
said. "You do hear discrimination complaints but we're working towards a 
consistent procedure. Basically everyone has to meet the same licensing 
requirements. That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
The board follows stringent guidelines, Ciau said, because its purpose is to 
protect the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you allow these people to operate on your relatives or your loved ones 
without first seeing proof they were adequately trained?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no worldwide accreditation organization that monitors foreign medical 
schools, although the state medical board's staff members have conducted some 
on-site inspections at schools in Great Britain, the Philippines and in Mexico, 
Ciau said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the medical schools inspected in Mexico, at Mexico City and in 
Guadalajara are private institutions filled with mostly students from the 
United States. Few of Mexico's public medical schools have undergone any 
similar inspections, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The board did once rely on a World Health Organization listing of medical 
schools until a scandal erupted in 1983 when hundreds of would-be physicians 
were caught cheating on basic qualifying exams by purchasing questions or whole 
tests in a thriving illegal marketplace. Hundreds more were graduates of 
certain for-profit schools, located mostly in the Caribbean, that at best were 
providing second-rate educations, and at worst, were little more than diploma 
mills. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy, said many Spanish-speaking foreign-born doctors, is that they are 
forced to meet the letter of the law that they claim is in contrast to more 
relaxed standards for graduates of U.S. medical schools. 
</P>
<P>
Said Robert J. Moser, assistant director for Refugee and Immigrant Services of 
Catholic Charities in San Diego: "If you're practicing medicine and saving 
lives in one country it doesn't mean your education was inferior." 
</P>
<P>
For Rigoberto Flores, who was already licensed in Mexico, the long trek is just 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
As a general practitioner for Seguro Social, one of Mexico's largest private 
health providers, Flores said that three years ago he was earning $254,000 
pesos a month, or roughly $90. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working at a health clinic in Queretaro where I was seeing 45 patients a 
day. I remember that on one night alone, I delivered 12 babies. I would come 
home exhausted," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that he heard from friends who had visited the United States who 
told him, "that if you work hard here, you can get a good job, a nice car and 
buy a home within one year." 
</P>
<P>
His years of schooling worked against him while he was in Los Angeles. "I was 
not street-wise. In Puebla, I always had my nose in a book and really didn't 
know the ways of the street." 
</P>
<P>
He would lend money to roommates who wouldn't pay him back. Then, with little 
mechanical knowledge, he bought his first car, a 1976 Buick, from another 
Latino. It cost $1,000. It ran for two months, then broke down. 
</P>
<P>
He has since moved to Fullerton and found another job as a cook, but recently 
was terminated. He is living off his partial savings, which help pay for a 
nursing course he is taking in Santa Ana. During the days, he attends adult 
English classes. 
</P>
<P>
After three years in California, the dream is beginning to dim. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it here. When I work as a cook, I still make more money than I made as 
a doctor (in Mexico). But it's very difficult to communicate. If I don't make 
it into nursing, I have to leave and go back home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, because in my letters to my mother, I never mention how hard 
living here is."

THE GOSPEL OF GAY, ACCORDING TO HARRY HAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not just the tasteful double strand of pearls around his neck or the 
single cascading earring that sets Harry Hay apart from your average 
78-year-old activist. It's his controversial theories on the nature of gay men, 
his demand that gays eschew "hetero-assimilation," his imperious demeanor and, 
most important, his only recently acknowledged place as father of the modern 
gay movement. 
</P>
<P>
Hay is well known in the gay community, but has never sought the limelight 
outside of it. That may change now that he is the subject of a new, aptly named 
biography, "The Trouble With Harry Hay" (Alyson). 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong Angeleno, Hay lives with John Burnside, his lover of 28 years, in an 
overstuffed cottage off Melrose Avenue near the Paramount Pictures studios. 
Recently, he sat at a book-covered table in the book-filled dining room of his 
book-crammed home doing what he does best: holding forth. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke about his theory of "gay consciousness" -- that gays are 
non-competitive, spiritually evolved beings who wrongly attempt assimilation 
into "hetero society," a phrase that sounds an awful lot like an epithet on his 
lips. (Don't even ask what he thinks of the Washington, D.C., men who filed 
suit last month to get a marriage license.) 
</P>
<P>
"All hetero boys are hopelessly competitive with each other," said Hay. 
"Competition is the way of life. But we gay people are not competitors. We want 
to share with one another. We're not the slightest bit interested in winning. 
This is not our way. And as I've always said, when we imitate heteros, we 
usually do it badly. We either overdo or underdo. Mostly, we overdo." With a 
coy shrug and a flick of his pearls, he drives the point home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's ridiculous," said David Thomas, a gay professor who is chairman 
of the politics department at UC Santa Cruz. "I know and Harry knows plenty of 
homosexuals who are competitive. Harry's way of thinking is very seductive, in 
some ways attractive and in some ways dangerous. It's basically a mythical way 
of thinking. But it can slide into a game of 'gayer than thou' because if 
somebody comes along and identifies homosexuals who are competitive, he says, 
'Well, they're not really gay.' " 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very controversial issue," said Martin Duberman, a gay professor at 
City University of New York who specializes in gay and lesbian history. "I 
think Harry would be hard put to demonstrate that the same gay personality type 
repeats itself across history. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of me strongly believes that gays are in fact different. I don't believe 
gays are different biologically, but they . . . identify with qualities which 
in our either/or society have been parceled out only to women. I think gay men 
do identify with being nurturing and supportive. As a group, they are less 
aggressive and competitive than straight men, but there are plenty of gay men 
who are at least as aggressive as straight men. 
</P>
<P>
"Harry has always had a tendency to infuriate people," said Duberman. "That 
kind of strong, confident personality is always likely to produce sparks. He 
has always been an admirable figure and an essential figure in our history. 
Without him, the movement would probably have gotten started later and 
differently. To have that kind of pioneering spirit, that willingness to get up 
essentially all alone and confront what was then a consensus view of 
homosexuality as pathology, takes extraordinary courage and will." 
</P>
<P>
Even Thomas, who disagrees with some of Hay's most closely held beliefs, is 
laudatory: "Harry is the most original and interesting figure that the American 
political gay movement has created. He should be better known." 
</P>
<P>
Hay's indefatigable political activism and in-your-face theories on the 
importance of gays make his life story entertainingly readable. In the 1930s he 
was introduced to Marxism and agitprop theater by his then lover, left-wing 
organizer Will Geer (the late actor who portrayed Grandpa on "The Waltons"). In 
the 1940s, he taught classes in Marxism. In 1950, he co-founded the country's 
first gay political organization, the Mattachine Society, for which he has 
earned his place in modern gay history. 
</P>
<P>
The Mattachine, named for a secret European all-male society of the 15th 
Century, was structurally modeled after the Communist Party's cells and secret 
fraternal orders. It had a pyramid structure, with discussion groups at the 
bottom and the small circle of founders at the top. Hay's biographer, Stuart 
Timmons, describes it as "an underground resistance." 
</P>
<P>
One of the Mattachine founders told Timmons that "Harry is the first person I 
know who said that gays are a minority -- an oppressed minority. This was the 
heart and core of the Mattachine movement and all subsequent gay movements." 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, the group took on as a cause the entrapment arrest of one of its 
members, who was accused of soliciting sex with a policeman. It set up the 
Citizens Committee to Outlaw Entrapment to raise funds for the defense and to 
educate Angelenos about the Police Department's harassment of gays. When the 
trial resulted in a hung jury and the judge dismissed the charges, the 
Mattachine Society declared it the first time an admitted homosexual had been 
freed after being charged with vagrancy and lewdness. 
</P>
<P>
After being ousted from the Mattachine Society in a complicated power struggle 
over political approaches, Hay spent the '60s in a kind of withdrawal, then 
returned to politics in the '70s with a move to New Mexico and involvement in 
Native American causes. 
</P>
<P>
On the verge of the '80s, Hay co-founded the Radical Faeries, a gay spiritual 
group that has worldwide chapters that meet once every year or two for woodsy 
retreats, in which participants are urged to "tear off the ugly green frog skin 
of conformity and find the beautiful fairy prince underneath." The group is a 
New Age synthesis of the spiritual and political, and is the wing of the gay 
movement that most closely expresses Hay's theory of gay pacifism. 
</P>
<P>
A conversation with Hay is a challenge. His manner is a combination of 
aristocratic kindness and didacticism mixed with outrage and italicized 
condescension if he thinks he's been asked a particularly stupid question. One 
question that set him off during a recent interview was this: "How could you 
have been so active in the Communist Party in the 1940s when it was so 
fervently anti-homosexual?" 
</P>
<P>
The fist pounds the table. The voice rises. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the silliest statement I have ever heard," he huffs. "The point is 
that homosexuality doesn't even exist then! The point is you're not getting the 
point! As far as society is concerned, I am a hetero who performs nasty acts 
with men! This is what I'm told. This is all I know. I have a predilection to 
love men and this is dirty, this is awful, this is terrible and nowhere in the 
world is this accepted, nowhere! So I am fighting oppression (as a Communist), 
recognizing that I am an oppressed person. I know it and feel it, but I don't 
have the words for it at that moment." 
</P>
<P>
Timmons said one of his greatest challenges in writing the book was coming to 
grips with the apparent contradiction of Hay's dedication to the Communist 
Party and the party's condemnation of homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of younger people have felt that this is a glaring contradiction and I 
struggled a lot when I was writing this," said Timmons, 33. "It's really hard 
to understand how underground the whole gay scene was and how there really was 
not that kind of identity and community and culture that we have so taken for 
granted today." It's not just that the Communist Party hated homosexuality, 
Timmons explained; the whole world hated it. Homosexuality was thought to be an 
arrested stage of heterosexuality, undesirable and curable. 
</P>
<P>
"The positive gay identity is something we discovered in the 1950s," said Hay. 
"This is what the Mattachine Society did. It doesn't exist until that time. 
When this guy (Timmons) tried to to ask me what the gay lifestyle was in 1929, 
I said, 'Honey, we didn't have a lifestyle in 1929!' That is a stupid statement 
because that's not a concept we even had yet." 
</P>
<P>
Said Timmons: "Many of the members of Harry's generation share the same 
frustration. Harry gets a little louder or upset. Young gay people and younger 
people in general suddenly think they know it all about the way it was and the 
way it should have been. The enormous pain and suffering and struggle of 
building (a movement) from the ground up just gets wiped out with one remark. 
As far as the Communist Party went, it was the place where many gays had the 
best chance of finding people who could look at them maybe some day as an 
oppressed group. They really did feel hopeful there, and more comfortable than 
they could have felt almost anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1960s, it was not at all unusual for gay men to marry, hoping to 
effect a "cure." Hay tried marriage after receiving what he calls "tragic 
advice" from a therapist, who told him his sexual past could be shut like a 
book and the future, opened like a new one. It wasn't to be. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Anita, entered the marriage knowing he was gay, but believing that 
Hay could change. Marriage for Hay was misery. He lead a double life, cruising 
the parks and other homosexual haunts, and then in 1950, fell madly in love 
with the man with whom he would make history: Rudi Gernreich with whom he would 
co-found the Mattachine Society. (Fifteen years later, Gernreich would become 
famous as the designer of the topless bathing suit. In keeping with the 
Mattachine's code of semi-secrecy, Gernreich's critical role in its founding 
was not revealed publicly until after his death in 1985.) 
</P>
<P>
When Hay, father of two girls, finally ended his marriage in 1951 on grounds of 
extreme cruelty, and began to live an openly gay life, his family was deeply 
wounded by a two-pronged shame: divorce and homosexuality. Anita died of cancer 
in 1983. One daughter does not speak to Hay; his relationship with the other is 
cordial but distant. 
</P>
<P>
"Harry totally went against the grain of society," said Timmons. "The big, 
distinguishing feature of Harry Hay is that he has encouraged people to be more 
gay, and in that way, to be more themselves. He has stopped all the 
accommodationist compromises that most civil rights-oriented activists will 
encourage. Therein lies his true, unique contribution."

Eventually, Hay was expelled by members of the Mattachine Society for the "sin" 
that would alienate his friends and fellow activists over and over: his 
irascible imperiousness. The same thing would eventually happen with the 
Radical Faeries, although Hay is now nearly untouchable as the elder statesman 
of the movement. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Hay's age may protect him somewhat from the attitudes that lead, 
for example, to Timmons' being chased and vilified by three men on the streets 
of Seattle during their book tour over Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, on a plane flying from Charlotte to Asheville in North Carolina, 
Hay was glared at by a trio of conservatively dressed families, which is about 
the most threatening thing that happens to him. 
</P>
<P>
"All I was wearing was just a simple string of false pearls, as you can see," 
said Hay. "On my way back from the head, one of the mothers stopped me and 
said, 'Why do you wear that?' and I said, 'Well, because I like it!' And I 
scooted past her back to my seat." 
</P>
<P>
He isn't optimistic for the civil rights of gays. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that gays are visible," he said. "We have busted out and we are all 
over the place. How safe are we? We have the word of the Honorable Supreme 
Court Justice Byron White, who in 1986 said that under the U.S. Constitution, 
homosexuals have no rights. (White wrote the majority opinion in a case that 
upheld a Georgia law outlawing acts of sodomy.) It hadn't been said openly that 
blatantly before. 
</P>
<P>
"So consequently, I would say we were less safe in '86 than we were in 1950 
before that statement was made. Back in the days when we were in the woodwork, 
you didn't know we were there. We were suffering, it was awful, but at least we 
were safe."

HERD OF 1,000-YARD RUSHERS THUNDERS THROUGH VENTURA COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County football season was a story of a premier quarterback, a herd 
of prolific running backs and spirited races in three of the four leagues. It 
also was the story of a dismal playoff showing by 10 of the 12 county teams 
that qualified. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake High's Todd Preston, the Ventura County back of the year, set passing 
records by the bushel, but his exploits were overwhelmed in sheer volume by the 
nine running backs who rushed for more than 1,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard's Kenyon Lewis led county rushers with 1,368 yards, but he was chased 
closely by Thousand Oaks' Cory Bowen (1,257), Westlake's Reuben Allen (1,230) 
and Ventura's Jack Hammond (1,217). 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in school history, Ventura had two 1,000-yard rushers -- 
sophomore Derek Swafford complemented Hammond by racking up 1,069 yards. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in Southern Section history, a freshman rushed for 1,000 
yards. Buena's George Keiaho, a Fiji native who turned 15 years old after the 
season's first game, had 1,134 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Swafford and Keiaho, the All-County second-team running backs, should keep 
Ventura-area fans entertained for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore's Tory Cabral (1,037) had his second 1,000-yard season in a row 
despite late-season injuries, Moorpark's Toussaint Powdrill rushed for 1,018 
yards and Santa Clara sophomore Lloyd Mix finished with 1,010. 
</P>
<P>
The most productive ground-gaining team, however, did not have a 1,000-yard 
rusher. Camarillo's wishbone attack rolled up 3,247 yards behind five backs 
with more than 400 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo also had the most impressive playoff showing, posting a 33-8 upset 
victory over previously unbeaten Pacific League champion Glendale in the first 
round of the Division II playoffs. Camarillo qualified for the playoffs as an 
at-large team after finishing fourth in the Marmonte League. 
</P>
<P>
Under first-year Coach Dick Billingsley, Oak Park was the only other county 
team to win a playoff game. The Eagles, who wrestled the Tri-Valley League 
championship from Carpinteria, defeated Salesian, 42-20, in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake was the county's best team early in the season, winning its first 
eight games. Thousand Oaks continued its domination of the Marmonte League, 
however, winning its fifth title in the past six years with a 41-10 win over 
Agoura on the final week of the regular season. Lancer two-way starter Bryce 
Elliott was named Ventura County lineman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Royal's 37-0 pasting of Westlake the same night enabled Thousand Oaks to come 
away with the championship despite having tied both Royal and Westlake. Royal's 
second-place finish was its best in school history and Coach Gene Uebelhardt 
was named Ventura County coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura rolled to the Channel League title, falling only to Rio Mesa the final 
week of league play. Buena, despite starting the season 1-4, rallied to finish 
second in the Channel League and make the playoffs for the third consecutive 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa's victory over Ventura persuaded principals of Channel League schools 
that the Spartans deserved the league's third playoff berth over two teams with 
the same 4-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore appeared invincible in zipping to an 8-0 start, but losses to 
Calabasas and Santa Paula cost the Flashes the Frontier League title. Santa 
Paula, by contrast, dropped two nonleague games but came on strong to post a 
4-0 Frontier League record and win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1990 ALL-VENTURA COUNTY FOOTBALL TEAM: PLAYER SKETCHES 
</P>
<P>
BACK OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County back of the year is Todd Preston, the Westlake quarterback 
who rewrote the Warrior record book. Preston, a 6-foot-3, 190-pound senior, 
threw for 2,427 yards this season, easily eclipsing his year-old school record 
of 2,014, and a school-record 5,608 yards in his three-year career. He 
completed 166 of 285 passes (58.2%) for a school-record 21 touchdowns -- the 
most in the county this season -- in leading Westlake to a record of 8-2-1. 
Preston, who is being recruited by many NCAA Division I colleges, passed for 46 
touchdowns in his career, another Westlake record. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LINEMAN OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County lineman of the year is Bryce Elliott of Thousand Oaks, a 
two-way starter and vocal team leader who helped the Lancers to the Marmonte 
League championship and a record of 7-2-2. Elliott, a 6-3, 210-pound senior, 
played tackle on offense and alternated between end and tackle on defense. On 
offense, Elliott laid devastating blocks to help the Lancers gain 3,889 yards 
in offense. On defense, he made 93 tackles and recorded seven sacks. And when 
the team needed to be motivated, Elliott, the son of longtime Thousand Oaks 
line coach Rob Elliott, was quick to provide inspiring words to his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COACH OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County coach of the year is Gene Uebelhardt, who turned Royal from 
a perennial loser into the county's best defensive team. Royal was 8-2-1, 
posting the most wins in school history and finishing second in the Marmonte 
League after tying Thousand Oaks, 26-26, and crushing highly regarded Westlake, 
37-0. The Highlanders notched five shutouts and allowed an average of only 8.2 
points a game. Before taking the Royal position in 1988, Uebelhardt served as 
an assistant for nine years at Cal Lutheran, his alma mater. As a college 
sophomore, he played fullback on Cal Lutheran's NAIA championship team in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
Preston was not the only record-setter at Westlake this season. Tailback Reuben 
Allen rushed for a school-record 1,230 yards in 175 carries. Allen, a 5-8, 
170-pound senior, complemented Preston's passing and kept opposing defenses 
from defending solely against the pass. He rushed for a county-leading 16 
touchdowns and averaged 7.0 yards a carry for a Westlake team that averaged 31 
points a game. 
</P>
<P>
The only junior on the All-County offensive team is Cory Bowen, a Thousand Oaks 
tailback who rushed for 1,257 yards in 162 carries. Bowen (5-7, 170), whose 
running style is marked by exceptional balance and dogged second effort, rushed 
for 11 touchdowns. His longest run was 84 yards. Although Bowen ran primarily 
between the tackles, his average of 7.8 yards a carry led the county among 
rushers with more than 65 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hammond, the fullback in Ventura's veer option, was equally impressive as 
a ballcarrier and a blocker. Hammond, a 5-10, 170-pound senior, rushed for 
1,217 yards in 158 carries for a 7.7-yard average. "Most of his yards were 
tough yards inside," Coach Harvey Kochel said. "Sometimes it was even more fun 
watching him block, though. He really laid some people out." Hammond's blocks 
helped tailback Derek Swafford rush for 1,069 yards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
The county's most prolific receiver by far was Westlake's Seamus Gibbons, who 
made 67 receptions for 1,082 yards and nine touchdowns. Gibbons, a 5-11, 
170-pound wide receiver, set school records for catches in a season and career 
and receiving yardage in a season and career. "Seamus was a tremendous threat 
who could run a variety of patterns," Coach Jim Benkert said. 
</P>
<P>
Another deep threat was Royal wide receiver Jeff Creed, who teamed with 
quarterback Ryan Fien and wide receiver Tony Liming to form a potent passing 
game. Rangy and strong, the 6-2, 180-pound Creed made 38 catches for 634 yards 
and 10 touchdowns. His longest reception was for 77 yards and he averaged 16.7 
yards a catch. Creed also played defensive back in passing situations and 
notched an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Another member of Westlake's talented group of skill-position players was tight 
end Dave Monheim, who made 37 receptions for 514 yards (13.9 average) and one 
touchdown. Monheim, 6-3, 210, began playing football only two years ago, but he 
quickly became the most feared receiving threat from the tight-end position in 
the county. Monheim also started at outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in school history, Ventura had two 1,000-yard rushers. Doing 
the bulk of the blocking for Jack Hammond and Derek Swafford were guards Samsun 
Okinaga and Brandon Evans. Crucial to the Cougars' veer offense, this pair of 
exceptional guards rarely allowed defensive penetration. 
</P>
<P>
As well as being excellent players, the Ventura guards are excellent students. 
Okinaga, a 6-0, 220-pound senior, holds a 4.2 grade-point average, never having 
gotten a grade lower than an A in high school. Evans, a 6-5, 255-pound senior, 
holds a 3.3 GPA and is being recruited by several NCAA Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
Also blocking in an option offense was Camarillo guard Dan Hile, a 6-3, 
215-pound senior who was the best blocker on a team that rushed for 3,247 yards 
out of the wishbone. Like Okinaga and Evans, Hile is an honor student. "Dan is 
very intelligent, he picked things up very fast and was able to make 
adjustments quickly," said Carl Thompson, Camarillo coach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KICKER 
</P>
<P>
Sal Balsano did a little bit of everything for Rio Mesa, leading the Spartans 
to an upset win over Channel League champion Ventura and a Southern Section 
Division II playoff berth. He averaged 36 yards a punt, made 18 point-after 
kicks, rushed for a team-high 863 yards, had 15 receptions for 167 yards and 
intercepted three passes, returning them for 77 yards. Balsano, a 5-8, 
160-pound senior, scored a team-high 84 points. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
The county's best defensive back was Royal's Tim Ross, a 6-4, 215-pound senior 
who was the backbone of the stingy Highlander defense. Ross, who might be the 
county's top NCAA Division I prospect, intercepted five passes and returned 
them 63 yards, including one for a touchdown. A three-year starter, he played 
most of the time at free safety but also saw action at linebacker and defensive 
end. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park's best player on offense and defense was Jason Smith, a 5-8, 
160-pound senior. Smith, a free safety, intercepted three passes and returned 
them 53 yards, including one for a touchdown. A wide receiver on offense, he 
also set a school record with 694 receiving yards on 39 receptions. The 
sticky-handed Smith caught four touchdown passes and also returned kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Anchoring the Thousand Oaks defense from free safety was David Watts, who Coach 
Bob Richards said was as effective as last year's Lancer standout safety, Steve 
Rudisill. Watts, twin brother of Lancers standout receiver Jeff Watts, had four 
interceptions and was rarely caught out of position on running plays. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo defeated Royal and scored an upset victory over Glendale in the first 
round of the playoffs after putting quarterback Corey Tucker in the defensive 
backfield as well. Tucker, it turned out, was an exceptional defensive back, 
intercepting three passes. As quarterback of the Scorpion wishbone, Tucker 
rushed for 796 yards and eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LINEBACKERS 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon Lewis, Oxnard's best player on both sides of the ball, was a tremendous 
rusher in more than one respect. As an outside linebacker, Lewis (6-2, 190) 
registered nine sacks and led Oxnard in tackles. As a tailback, he led the 
county with 1,368 yards rushing and nine touchdowns in 225 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Mullaney was the player in the middle of the defensive and offensive 
schemes for Buena, which finished second in the Channel League. Mullaney, a 
5-11, 185-pound senior, was a ferocious hitter from his linebacker position. 
Mullaney also played fullback, opening holes for freshman tailback George 
Keiaho and rushing for 621 yards and 12 touchdowns himself. 
</P>
<P>
The Channel League defensive player of the year was Rio Mesa's Frank Tinoco, a 
6-3, 200-pound middle linebacker. Tinoco spearheaded a Spartan defense that 
allowed a lot of yards -- but precious few between the guards. "Frank's 
strength and intensity were an inspiration to our entire defense," Rio Mesa 
Coach John Reardon said. 
</P>
<P>
Another middle linebacker who stuffed running plays up the middle was 
Camarillo's Tag Johnson, a 6-0, 190-pound junior. Johnson led the Scorpions 
with 115 tackles and he also had three interceptions. He also played fullback 
in Camarillo's wishbone offense and rushed for 634 yards and five touchdowns 
and had one game of more than 200 yards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
One of only two juniors on the All-Ventura County defense is Royal's Jason 
Evans, a 6-0, 252-pound defensive lineman. Evans' strength and quickness made 
him very difficult to block. He was named the Marmonte League's co-lineman of 
the year along with Elliott of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Another stalwart member of Royal's defensive front was Matt Tomaszewski, who 
played on the line and at middle linebacker. Tomaszewski, a 5-11, 195-pound 
senior, was not only the Highlanders' leading tackler, he was the most spirited 
defensive player as well. 
</P>
<P>
Largely because of the play of Evans and Tomaszewski, Royal posted five 
shutouts and held opponents to 1,030 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Mike Ciandella continued the strong Thousand Oaks tradition of 
hard-rushing defensive linemen. Ciandella, a 5-11, 190-pound senior, registered 
13 sacks, second most in school history. An intelligent and emotional player, 
Ciandella helped the Marmonte League champion Lancers register two shutouts and 
hold opposing teams to an average of 134 yards rushing.

GRANADA HILLS' WASHINGTON MAKES SIZABLE IMPACT IN THE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brett Washington, Granada Hills High's massive running back, not only leaves 
behind a trail of battered defenders as he concludes his three-year varsity 
career, he bequeaths a remarkable legacy in area football annals. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 220-pound senior has posted a unique daily double. As a junior, the 
running back/linebacker who started his career as a nose guard, was named The 
Times' Valley lineman of the year. Twelve months later, he has become the 
Valley's back of the year, forming bookend awards that attest to his 
distinctive versatility on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is joined on this year's team by Quartz Hill senior Selves Smith, a 
linebacker and running back who is the lineman of the year. John Albee, who led 
Quartz Hill to its first berth in a Southern Section championship game and an 
11-3 record, is the coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, along with teammates Derrick Stewart, a defensive back, and 
quarterback Bryan Martin give Granada Hills three representatives on the 
23-member team culled from 40 schools in the Valley. Placing two players each 
on the team are Canyon, Crespi, Hart, Kennedy, Quartz Hill and Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Washington is a repeat selection along with Stewart, Kennedy's Ontiwaun Carter 
and linemen Tim DeGroote (Hart) and John DiSante (Notre Dame). 
</P>
<P>
Washington was to high school running backs what Charles Barkley has become to 
professional basketball players. The Granada Hills senior listed his playing 
weight at 220, admits to 225 but might weigh closer to 240. Northwest Valley 
Conference defensive backs are resting easier now that they no longer face the 
prospect of squaring off with Washington as he turns the corner. 
</P>
<P>
He rushed for 1,638 yards and scored 24 touchdowns and 146 points, all school 
records, and finished his three-year career with 3,410 yards, 49 touchdowns and 
296 points, the best marks in school history. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills co-Coach Darryl Stroh likens Washington to Earl Campbell, the 
former NFL running back with a pair of massive thighs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know know what Campbell was like in high school, but I can't imagine 
that he was any better than Washington," Stroh said. 
</P>
<P>
But Washington is more than just a big load to handle. He's surprisingly quick. 
Among the 14 school records he set in his career is longest run from scrimmage, 
a 93-yard jaunt that came as part of a five-touchdown game against Compton. He 
also had two other runs of longer than 80 yards this season. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the only good news for Granada Hills' opponents is that Washington 
tempers his explosive power in a gentle disposition. The soft-spoken player 
will be remembered at the school as much for his personality as for his 
records. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to cite his favorite memories of the 1990 season, he typically 
ignored his individual accomplishments and cited the team's achievements. 
Granada Hills won the North Valley League title and posted a 10-2 record en 
route to a berth in the City Section 4-A Division semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know I was going to get all this yardage," he said this week. "I'm 
proud we finished with a good record and took the league title. I'm going to 
remember the friendship on the team. We respect each other and I'm going to 
miss everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Washington has planned a recruiting trip to Arizona and also has drawn interest 
from USC, Colorado and Washington. He was born and raised in Los Angeles but 
has no qualms about leaving the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind, I want to explore the world," he said.

BACK OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
If Granada Hills High running back Brett Washington is sometimes mistaken for a 
lineman, it's for just cause. The bulky senior started his three-year career 
with the Highlanders as a nose guard. He ends that career as the most 
accomplished running back in school history, having set 16 school records. 
Washington rushed for 1,638 yards this year -- averaging nearly 10 yards a 
carry -- and finished his career with 3,410 yards. He also enters The Times' 
records with a unique claim: He is the only player in the area to win both 
lineman and back of the year awards in a career. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LINEMAN OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
There's little chance that Quartz Hill would have played at Anaheim Stadium for 
the Division I championship without the help of Selves Smith. As Canyon Coach 
Harry Welch said, "He can dominate from sideline to sideline." Smith anchored 
the area's most intimidating defense as an attacking linebacker. In addition, 
he was a member of the Rebels' Three Horsemen backfield that powered the team 
to an 11-3 record. Smith rushed for 549 yards, scored 10 touchdowns and 
averaged 7.0 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COACH OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
Most Golden League coaches objected when the Southern Section moved the league 
to Division I, but the timing could not have been better for Quartz Hill. In 
their first year in the area's toughest division, the Rebels fielded their 
strongest team since the school opened 26 years ago. John Albee, 50, has been 
at Quartz Hill for all but three of those years, and this season's performance 
easily ranks as his career achievement. Quartz Hill won its first outright 
league title and at least a share of its third en route to a 11-3 record. The 
Rebels also accomplished a league first: handing Canyon its only home loss in 
league play in Welch's nine years with the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Bryan Martin combined with Washington to give Granada Hills one of 
the area's most diversified attacks. Martin, who transferred from Illinois as a 
junior, completed 118 of 241 passes for 1,912 yards and 20 touchdowns to help 
lead the Highlanders to the City Section 4-A Division semifinals and a 10-2 
record. He tied a single-game school record when he threw for six touchdowns 
against Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy Coach Bob Francola spoke for most Golden Cougar fans when he said at 
the end of the season, "I'm sure going to miss Ontiwaun Carter." The back ends 
a three-year career as the school's all-time leading rusher with 4,274 yards, 
including 1,521 this season. He also caught 38 passes for 532 yards in three 
seasons and rushed for 200 or more yards in a game five times. Carter, a repeat 
All-Valley section, has lined up recruiting trips at USC, Arizona, California 
and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar junior Tobaise Brookins not only filled the breach after the graduation 
of Jerome Casey, he gained more yards than Casey, rushing for 1,674 yards. He 
also scored 21 touchdowns. Running behind a beefy offensive line that helped 
the Spartans win 10 consecutive games before falling in the City 3-A 
quarterfinals, Brookins was the area's busiest tailback with 282 carries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
Alemany stumbled to a 4-5 record and a fourth-place finish in the Mission 
League, but no one overlooked tight end Richard Dice. League coaches voted him 
the co-MVP after he caught 50 passes for 818 yards and 10 touchdowns. Only a 
junior, Dice may terrorize opposing offenses as well next season. He played 
safety in the last game of the season, causing two fumbles and recovering one. 
</P>
<P>
Dice shared the league MVP award with a wide receiver who didn't even play as a 
junior. Crespi's Ryan Kieling returned to the Celts in 1990 after a one-year 
sabbatical and then taught Mission League defenses a few lessons. He led the 
area in receiving with 63 catches, good for 898 yards and nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth's Delvon Hardaway may have been better known as a basketball player 
until his senior football season. Playing for a team that won only two games, 
Hardaway caught 23 passes, an ordinary number -- but his 23.3 per-catch average 
bespeaks extraordinary skills. Myron Gibford calls Hardaway his best receiver 
in 11 seasons as Chatsworth coach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
The All-Valley offensive line includes two repeat selections who rate among the 
best linemen on the West Coast: Tim DeGroote of Hart and John DiSante of Notre 
Dame. DeGroote played both ways for the Indians and projects as an offensive 
lineman in college. As a defender, he had five sacks and more than 60 tackles, 
and Coach Mike Herrington calls him the best lineman at Hart in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
DiSante also played both ways in 1990 and also projects as an offensive lineman 
in college. A solid student, he has scheduled trips to UCLA, Cal, Colorado, 
Stanford and Washington. DiSante anchored an offensive line that led Notre Dame 
to a 6-4-1 record and helped make stars of first-year quarterback Steve 
Colella, who passed for 1,598 yards, and Fano Malieitulua, who gained 1,098 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon has reached the Southern Section semifinals eight consecutive times 
under Welch, and tackle John Artimovich's three-year career underscores the 
Cowboy method. Undersized at 5-11, 226 pounds, Artimovich was the Golden 
League's top lineman and was the emotional leader for a typical Canyon 
offensive line that was matchless in the area for its crispness and precision. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing undersized about Montclair Prep's Donovan Roy except for the 
division in which he plays. Roy helped lead the Mounties to the Division X 
title and a 10-3 record. Many expected the Mounties' running game to suffer 
after the transfer of Derek Sparks, The Times' Valley back of the year last 
year. But behind Roy's massive frame, sophomore Eliel Swinton stepped into the 
lineup and rushed for 1,719 yards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KICKER 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's Keith West rates as the most versatile athlete in the school. Besides 
earning All-City honors in soccer, he wears at least four hats with the Golden 
Cougar football team. As a wide receiver, he led City Section players from the 
Valley with 39 catches, good for 496 yards and five touchdowns. As a defensive 
back, he led the team with four interceptions. He also averaged 39.5 yards a 
punt, converted 27 of 33 extra-point attempts and kicked three field goals, 
including one of 53 yards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE BACKFIELD 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Stewart of Granada Hills is the most respected defensive back in the 
area. Consider: He's a two-time All-Valley selection and has intercepted all of 
one pass in three seasons. Teams don't throw in his direction. Plus, as the 
"bandit" in the Granada Hills defense, he often played on the line of 
scrimmage. He led the team in tackles last season and was second in 1990. He 
also became a running back this season, rushing for 303 yards. 
</P>
<P>
After a 1,000-yard season last year at Crespi, Leonice Brown transferred to San 
Fernando where he was happier and equally productive. He gained 1,060 yards 
despite sharing the ball in San Fernando's wishbone attack. He started in the 
San Fernando secondary and shared the North Valley League MVP award with 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
After two consecutive disappointing seasons, Antelope Valley has reason for 
hope next year, particularly because Freddy Edwards returns for his senior 
season. He led the team in rushing with 810 yards (6.5 a carry), completed six 
of 14 passes for 42 yards and was the team's big hitter in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar has a knack of producing Division I collegiate players and Girmar 
Johnson seems destined to join the list. He excelled in the secondary, leading 
a defense that posted five shutouts and allowed 196 yards a game. He also 
rushed for 286 yards in 41 carries, intercepted two passes and scored six 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Iheanyi Uwaezuoke of Harvard caught everyone's attention because of 
his name. But the Nigerian-born wide receiver and defensive back proved he's 
more than just a phonetic challenge. He helped lead Harvard (9-2) to the San 
Fernando Valley League title, caught 23 passes for 427 yards and three 
touchdowns, and was a first-team all-league selection on offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LINEBACKERS 
</P>
<P>
Welch called linebacker Scott Blade his Canyon team's best player and leader of 
its swarming defense, which allowed 196 yards and 7.7 points a game. He also 
played fullback, gaining 306 yards in 41 carries, a 7.5 average. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi might be more hard-pressed to maintain its image as one of the area's 
most physical teams after the graduation of linebacker Frank Romano. A mainstay 
in the middle for the past two seasons, Romano also starred at tight end. He 
was second on the team in receptions with 25 for 348 yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Darnell Hendricks of Taft led the team in rushing with 708 yards (5.2 yards per 
carry), but he made an even bigger impact on defense. In the same mold as 
Cornell Collier, a former Taft linebacker now playing at Cal, he accounted for 
78 tackles and led the team with 10 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
The bad news for Quartz Hill opponents is that defensive tackle Ralph Gutierrez 
is only a junior. With Gutierrez in the middle of things all year, Quartz Hill 
allowed an average of only 98.7 yards on the ground and kept people out of the 
end zone after halftime for half the season. In their last six games, including 
four in the playoffs, the Rebels allowed only seven points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Hart's image as an offensive powerhouse remains intact, but defensive end 
George Kase did his best to alert people to the Indian defense. 
</P>
<P>
A second-team All-Valley selection last season, Kase leaves Hart as the 
school's all-time sack leader with 36, tripling the previous school record. 
Three times this season he recorded three-sack games.

Thomas Jefferson grew them, P. T. Barnum hawked them and George Washington 
Carver invented hundreds of ways to use them. Today the United States is the 
world's leading producer of peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
What do these goobers have going for them? 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, they're good for you: Peanuts roasted in their skins are more 
than one-fourth protein, a good source of B vitamins and contain as much iron 
as an equal amount of spinach. 
</P>
<P>
More important, they taste good. The best we've tried come from The Peanut 
Shop, a pint-sized place in Williamsburg, Va., that's been doing business the 
same careful way for more than 20 years. Their jumbo, meaty nuts are cooked 
daily in peanut oil without additives or preservatives, and shipped directly to 
you in a classy can. 
</P>
<P>
These aren't your everyday peanuts -- these are peanuts for particular people. 
They're not too salty and they're not too greasy. It's as if the peanuts from 
your past went out and got a degree. 
</P>

A 2 1/2-pound tin (salted or unsalted) costs $12.95. KATHIE JENKINS

A Tufts University student walked into introductory nutrition recently and 
handed one of us a thick booklet. It had come from a "wellness center" in 
California where her mother was considering signing on for an evaluation. The 
student had a healthy skepticism about what was being offered her mother -- 
skepticism that was right on target. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the program worked. For a fee of $125, payable in advance, the 
subscriber would get "56 chemistries, a consultation and a month of answers to 
questions." A postscript advised that follow-up by mail at $50 for three 
months, or at the bargain cost of $150 a year, or in-person appointments at $50 
each were "highly beneficial" to success in a "new lifestyle of optimum 
health." 
</P>
<P>
According to the cover letter, laboratories where the chemical analyses can be 
performed are available in eight states from Maine to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
In the next section, the subscriber was asked to furnish an extensive and 
somewhat strange health history, reminiscent of those used by charlatans for 
decades. It asked about a host of symptoms and conditions, from the specific, 
such as diabetes or high blood pressure, to the very vague: chronic fatigue, 
inability to concentrate, mucus and stress. From this laundry list, the 
"nutritionist" in charge will identify symptoms that supplements can correct. 
</P>
<P>
The inventory also includes a profile of typical food intake, medication use, 
exercise and, most specifically, an "elimination record." Then follows a 
patient "stool evaluation," an in-depth inquiry into color, odor and 
consistency. If you're beginning to squirm at this point, so were we. But hold 
on, it gets worse. 
</P>
<P>
On the final page of the history, the individual is asked to perform a test of 
colon transit time, taking a "moderate" serving of corn or beets and noting 
when the vegetable shows up in the feces. Too long a transit time may signal 
"suboptimal colon health," while a very rapid transit time "may indicate poor 
absorption and assimilation of nutrients." 
</P>
<P>
Next comes a disclaimer, which must be signed by the subscriber and witnessed. 
It can be described only as a mixture of gobbledygook and legal cover. And as 
you might expect, the last three pages are order blanks. One is for books, 
tapes and videos (costing as much as $49 for "Miracle Man"). Two are for 
"metabolic" products, to "temporarily spark normal functions." Curiously, of 
some 68 products on the list, just three can be clearly identified as 
nutrients, and none is likely to be in short supply in the diet. 
</P>
<P>
We can sum up this program in one word: outrageous. Without going into a 
point-by-point review, two highlights should serve to illustrate. First, many 
of the analyses offered are reliable only if done rigorously in laboratories 
with the highest standards. When these tests are done correctly and 
abnormalities are found, they are considered along with other evidence from a 
physical examination by a physician, who then decides whether and what 
treatment is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor may feel that nutritional counseling is an important part of the 
treatment. If so, he or she will refer the individual to a registered dietitian 
or nutritionist properly trained in diet counseling. Based on a personal 
interview, this professional will in turn suggest appropriate diet 
modification, perhaps along with a multivitamin and mineral supplement at, but 
not above, 100% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances, as a bit of insurance. 
The regimen is unlikely to include such odd-sounding supplements as 
"Energetic," "Tryptogenics," "Yin-plus" or "Germanium LC," the latter costing 
as much as $50 for 30 capsules. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the section focusing on lower-bowel function is particularly 
bothersome. The appearance and odor of feces is influenced by many factors, 
including diet. Normal variations generally are no cause for alarm. On the 
other hand, blood in the stools, which can occur for several reasons, is a 
symptom that demands immediate attention, not mail-order advice. That also goes 
for other symptoms on the list. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that most Americans could do well to eat a diet higher in fiber, and 
that doing so shortens the length of time it takes for food to travel through 
the digestive tract and for waste products to be excreted. But the so-called 
"colon transit time test," looking for evidence of beets or corn in feces, is 
absurd, unpleasant and diagnostically worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there's nothing wrong with ordering multivitamin and mineral 
supplements at 100% of the RDA from a catalogue, especially if they are well 
priced. But beyond that, when it comes to mail-order nutrition advice, the best 
place for the brochure is in the paper-recycling bin. 
</P>
<P>
Question: I remember reading that garlic oil had caused botulism food 
poisoning. I saw garlic oil recently in the grocery store where I shop. Is it 
safe to eat? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes, it's safe. Following two outbreaks of botulism food poisoning 
traced to garlic packed in oil, the Food and Drug Administration stepped in. 
The agency now requires that garlic-in-oil mixtures that aren't heat-processed 
and rely for safety on refrigeration must contain other protection: specified 
levels of either substances that inhibit microbial growth or acidifying agents 
such as citric or phosphoric acid. 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, it's easy to see why the food-poisoning cases occurred. To make 
the mixture, minced garlic is combined with ice water and oil. Unfortunately, 
the combination of a non-acid mixture (water), lack of oxygen in the jar and a 
warm temperature created just the right environment for botulinum spores, 
commonly found on many tubers and root vegetables, to germinate. The 
microorganisms then grew, producing the very dangerous toxin. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the problem was traced to improper handling. In other words, 
consumers forgot to keep the product in the refrigerator, despite clear 
directions on the label. Leaving the mixture out on the counter instead of in 
the cold proved a critical error. Thanks to the new FDA regulation, the problem 
is resolved. But this episode underscores the need for consumers to follow 
directions on the label. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I bought a prickly pear for the first time and really enjoyed it. Can you 
tell me its nutritional value? 
</P>
<P>
A: Prickly pear is the fruit of the cactus of the same name. A typical fruit 
contains about 50 calories and more than one-third of the day's quota for 
Vitamin C. It also provides small amounts of B vitamins and minerals. Whether 
or not you eat the seeds is a matter of taste. Some like them; others find them 
too hard. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, preparing prickly pears was like tangling with a porcupine: The 
pears often came with spines still attached. One technique used was to singe 
them before attempting to peel the fruit. Nowadays, though, the spines 
generally are removed before the fruit appears in the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Prickly pears are native to the Americas and were brought back to Spain in the 
16th Century. They are known by several names, including Indian or Barbary 
pears and tuna figs. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband is a heart-attack survivor. He has given up smoking, is 
attempting to follow a cholesterol-lowering diet and is taking medication to 
bring down his cholesterol. Despite a doctor's advice to the contrary, he is 
skeptical about whether this is of any value or whether, as he says, it's "too 
late" for him. What do you say? 
</P>
<P>
A: We can assure your husband that his efforts are worthwhile. It's true that 
the extent of damage to the heart and the severity of coronary-artery disease 
are more important predictors of risk of a second heart attack, especially in 
the first few months, than is serum cholesterol. But evidence from a number of 
studies of individuals who have already sustained one heart attack shows that, 
over the longer term, reducing serum cholesterol is linked to lowered incidence 
of both nonfatal and fatal heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jacques E. Rossouw of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and his 
colleagues reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that when data from 
eight such studies were considered together, a 10% reduction in 
serum-cholesterol levels led to a reduction of 19% and 12%, respectively, in 
the number of nonfatal and fatal heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
These figures aren't much different from those in studies that focus on 
individuals who are at risk of heart attacks but haven't yet sustained one. In 
that group, the same cholesterol reduction led to a drop of 25% in nonfatal and 
12% in fatal heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
As Rossouw points out, these studies have been conducted over relatively short 
periods. Longer trials and more effective lowering of cholesterol could produce 
even more positive results. So tell your husband to keep up the good work: He's 
on the right track with his cholesterol-lowering efforts, and he needn't be 
discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
We would only hope that his healthier lifestyle also includes regular physical 
exercise.

"Steak and potatoes" in my house means simple meat: grilled and unadorned. 
Instead, I put my efforts into creating new potato dishes. A gratin of very 
thinly sliced potato layers, for instance, sprinkled with shredded Havarti 
cheese and napped with a light mustard sauce. I bake them until the potatoes 
are fork-tender and a rich golden crust forms on top. Our entire family asks 
for seconds and, in some cases, thirds. 
</P>
<P>
During the holidays, the gratin makes a delicious and uncomplicated offering. 
With their tender texture and zesty mustard seasoning, these potatoes work well 
with many entrees. For example, honey-baked ham, herb-roasted chicken, a 
garlic-studded leg of lamb and, of course, all manner of steaks or roast beef. 
</P>
<P>
The dish has other good features. After baking, the potatoes could be kept warm 
for up to 30 minutes when covered loosely with foil, giving a cook time to put 
finishing touches on other foods. In addition, it's easy to double or triple 
the gratin for large gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
MUSTARD-SCENTED GRATIN OF POTATOES 
</P>
<P>
3 1/2 pounds baking potatoes 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme 
</P>
<P>
10 ounces Havarti cheese, shredded 
</P>
<P>
1 1/3 cups half and half 
</P>
<P>
1 1/3 cups chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
Peel potatoes and cut each into 1/8-inch thick slices. Arrange 1/3 potatoes in 
overlapping slices in large oven-to-table dish sprayed with vegetable spray. 
Generously season potatoes with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with 1/3 of thyme and 
1/3 of cheese. Top with 2 more layers potatoes, seasonings and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Whisk together half and half, chicken stock and Dijon mustard in bowl and pour 
mixture over potatoes. Bake at 400 degrees 50 to 60 minutes, or until potatoes 
are tender when pierced with knife and top is golden and crusty. Serve warm. 
Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: There are several varieties of Havarti available. Plain Havarti, without 
caraway seeds or herbs, is best for this recipe. Other cheeses such as Vermont 
Cheddar, Monterey Jack or mild Gouda could be substituted.

ABOUT WINE: WINE'S GREATEST ENEMY: LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buying a bottle of wine out of a store rack or a cold case illuminated by 
fluorescent light may be worse than buying that same bottle from its cardboard 
box -- even if it has been stored at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
"Lightstruck" wines are a major problem -- but one that is rarely spoken about 
outside of winery laboratories. These are bottles that offer no ultraviolet 
(UV) protection and have been exposed to sunlight or fluorescent light for even 
short amounts of time. 
</P>
<P>
One reason beer has traditionally been bottled in brown glass bottles is that 
beer is sensitive to light and this so-called amber glass gives UV protection. 
</P>
<P>
The wine industry, however, has tradition standing in its path. Wine has 
traditionally been bottled in green bottles, though some wines (including a 
number of sparkling wines) are bottled in clear glass (called "flint" by the 
industry). Most of these bottles offer no protection from UV light. The results 
can be staggering. 
</P>
<P>
Wine makers who are concerned about this problem say that a bottle of wine 
stored in the sun or under a fluorescent light source can change the aroma of a 
wine radically, leaving it with a funny aroma and taste. 
</P>
<P>
One wine maker who experimented recently to see the effects of lightstruck wine 
was John Thacher of Cuvaison in the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a bottle of Chardonnay from a fresh case and stuck it outside on a 
cool day," said Thacher. "The bottle never got above 50 degrees all day. We 
left it there from 9 a.m. to 2 in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we brought the wine back in and set up a tasting, with a bottle from the 
case and the bottle from outside. The whole staff tasted the wines 
independently, and there was absolutely no comparison: The one from outside had 
turned smokey, lost its fruit, had gotten a gunflint aroma." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Markell, wine maker for Piper-Sonoma Cellars, called the aroma of a 
lightstruck wine "kind of like plastic or styrene." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Fowler of Mumm Napa Valley said, "There is a reaction between the sun and 
the sulfur components (in wine) that create this aroma, and it ranges from 
rotting leaves to a skunk." He said that Robert Leaute, brandy master for Remy 
Martin, refers to the lightstruck smell as that of rotting cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Bisson, a researcher working with Dr. Ann Noble at the University of 
California at Davis on the problem of lightstruck wine, said there were "some 
distinctive plastic characteristics that came out (of her research), and one I 
got was a Cornnuts aroma." A partial solution is on the way, however. The 
largest producer of wine bottles in the United States, Owens-Brockway Glass 
Container, a division of Owens-Illinois, responding to industry pressure, 
announced recently that it has begun to produce bottles that have a UV 
protector built into the glass. 
</P>
<P>
An letter to Owens' clients some weeks ago said that all bottles of the 
"Champagne Green" color will contain the UV protector. This is a color commonly 
used in the California wine industry for Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and 
other popular wines. 
</P>
<P>
However, many producers of Sauvignon Blanc, White Zinfandel and other paler 
wines like to use the flint (clear) bottle, which offers little protection from 
ultraviolet light. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Babin, manager of production planning for Owens' West Coast operations, 
said the firm had not yet decided whether it would extend the UV protection to 
other colors of wine bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Arrowood, who was the founding wine maker at Chateau St. Jean in 1975, 
said he knew back then that light could be a major problem, so he chose to 
bottle all his Rieslings and Gewurztraminers, the most sensitive wines, in 
amber (brown), "because that is the lowest actinic glass you can get." He said 
low-actinic glass is light-absorbing and protects the wine "even better than 
green." 
</P>
<P>
"(Lightstruck wine) was a concern to us back then, and we chose amber to keep 
the wines fresh and to give us an extra edge," he said. But he noted that it 
was difficult for him to find a supply of amber wine bottles. Owens made none 
for wine. Eventually St. Jean bought amber bottles from Dome Glass in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Arrowood said the color called Antique, a kind of amber/green, offers 
protection from UV and he said a number of wine makers are looking at it. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler at Mumm said a lot of research is being done now in France. "This is a 
major problem," he said. "An hour of direct sunlight in a clear glass bottle 
can noticeably change the wine. One of the reasons Roederer Cristal is wrapped 
in yellow cellophane is that they believe that it protects the wine better." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler acknowledged that the best bottle color for wine is amber. "The beer 
people have known about this because of the fluorescent light in coolers," he 
said. He added that the problem is worse with white wine and Champagne than 
with red wine because the tannin in red wine is a good protector. 
</P>
<P>
Dawnine Dyer, wine maker at Domaine Chandon, said the problem is a major one 
for the consumer "because of the way we are marketing wine -- by the glass. The 
bottle is opened and it sits out, often under a light." 
</P>
<P>
She said that wine dispensed out of a nitrogen dispensing machine may be 
affected by the light inside the machine. Domaine Chandon was so concerned 
about lightstruck wine that it sponsored research at UC Davis into the problem. 
</P>
<P>
A researcher set wine bottles out under varying wattages of light and for 
varying lengths of time "and there were detectable reactions in as little as 20 
minutes," Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
After seeing this research she became much more wary of buying wine in retail 
shops. "If the only bottle I can see is standing up on a shelf," she said, "I 
ask if they can get me a bottle out of the case in back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wine of The Week 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brothers Meloso Cream Sherry ($3.75) -- Cream Sherry is a lovely 
finish to a holiday meal and this reasonably priced wine is one of the best on 
the market. The rich aroma is nutty, round and smells of roasted pecans. The 
sweetness of the wine (it is, in fact, not terribly sweet) is offset by good 
acidity. The Christian Brothers brand (now owned by Heublein) makes a line of 
fine dessert wines, all priced at less than $4. These include two light Ports 
as well as an attractive dry Sherry, an excellent aperitif. Two other cream 
Sherries worth looking for: Gallo's Livingston Cream and Weibel Cream Sherry.

TRUCE IN VENICE CANAL BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
LANDMARK: GALANTER AND HOMEOWNERS RESOLVE THEIR DISPUTE OVER MATERIALS TO 
RESTORE THE WATERWAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-stalled effort to rehabilitate the Venice Canals got a jump-start this 
week as City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter publicly abandoned a nasty dispute with 
homeowners, and the city set a 1992 target date to start work on the crumbling 
waterways. 
</P>
<P>
"This piece of paper is like gold to me," said Anita Henkins, waving a project 
schedule prepared by city engineering officials at a meeting called by 
Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
Henkins, a canal resident since 1948 and a veteran of previous failed attempts 
to renovate the last of Venice's waterways, said this is the first time 
refurbishing plans have gotten to the point of setting a start date. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, a slew of permits that must be obtained from agencies 
ranging from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to the Army Corps of Engineers. 
The canals' historical significance means that there must also be consultation 
with several cultural commissions and historical review boards. And the city 
and the California Coastal Commission must also give their approval. 
</P>
<P>
Venice founder Abbot Kinney built a system of canals in the early part of the 
century to try to create a community fashioned after its namesake city in 
Italy. But nearly all of the canals have been paved over. The six remaining 
canals were build by another developer and have been in disrepair for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter has been at war with some of her canal-neighborhood constituents since 
she was elected 3 1/2 years ago. The key issue is which brand of perforated 
concrete block should be used to reinforce the canal banks and hold soil in 
place to provide a good growing environment for natural wetland grasses and 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter, citing recommendations from state environmental experts, has backed a 
less-expensive product, Armorflex. Members of the Venice Canals Assn. 
overwhelmingly favor a block called Loffelstein, which they say is far more 
attractive and worth the added expense. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the dispute got quite heated. Galanter told the residents at one 
heated meeting that it would be "Armorflex or nothing." And when members of the 
canals association framed the issue as "Loffelstein or death," it wasn't clear 
that they were joking. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, however, Galanter capitulated, telling about 90 property 
owners present that the decision was their call. "The choice is going to be 
made by the property owners," Galanter said. "It doesn't matter what my 
position is." 
</P>
<P>
Association member Mark Galanty pronounced the statement as "extreme progress. 
It's the best thing we've ever heard." 
</P>
<P>
There are about 380 properties bordering the canals and their owners have 
formed an assessment district to pay for the repairs. But if Galanter had 
continued to insist that the choice was Armorflex or nothing, and if the 
residents had disliked it enough to vote for nothing, the district, by law, 
would have been disbanded. Any effort to refurbish the canals would then have 
had to start anew. 
</P>
<P>
To start the permit process as soon as possible, city engineers have devised a 
dual proposal under which agencies would approve either material, depending on 
the outcome of a vote of the homeowners. That can't occur until July, when a 
one-year test of Loffelstein along a short stretch of canal bank is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The test was demanded by property owners, who insisted their favored material 
could grow the environmentally correct marsh grasses as well as an Armorflex 
test site has shown it can -- which some residents contend is not very well. 
</P>
<P>
The vote is expected to be a landslide for Loffelstein. Galanty said the most 
recent association vote showed that "99.9%" of members favor it. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Monday night, property owner Lester Light, a Santa Monica 
Superior Court judge, said the test sites were unrealistic because they had to 
be covered with protective fencing to keep the canal ducks from eating the 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that there will always be children, ducks and dogs on the canal banks, 
Light advised his neighbors to select the blocks based on their "naked" 
appearance, because they may never be obscured by vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
Another property owner, David Contant, was more hopeful about the plants' 
future. "The beauty of the canals will come as these two products disappear. 
They both look like hell." 
</P>
<P>
The property owners insist they are willing to pay for the Loffelstein, also 
called Loffel Block. They will be billed through the special assessment 
district over a 10-year period, in an amount to be determined when the project 
goes out for bids. 
</P>
<P>
According to city Project Engineer Sam Koduah, the estimated 1990 cost of 
Armorflex is $2.1 million, while Loffelstein $2.9 million. Several speakers 
said that would total $300 or more a year per property. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, a different canal renovation plan pushed by Galanter's 
predecessor, Pat Russell, had been approved by the city and was under review by 
the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
After Galanter was elected however, she withdrew the project in response to 
concerns raised by the Coastal Commission staff, which found that the planned 
vertical concrete banks were not hospitable to wetlands vegetation and animal 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Many community members suspected Galanter of retaliating against them because 
of their support of Russell in the 1987 election, and the battle was on. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, several residents at Monday's meeting walked out remarking about 
Galanter's change in position and manner. "I'm in a state of shock," said Bob 
Myers. "I've never been in a meeting with Ruth Galanter where she was so 
agreeable." 
</P>
<P>
Standing nearby was Mary Lee Gray, who is running for City Council against 
Galanter next April. Galanter's fence-mending efforts, said Gray, a longtime 
field deputy for County Supervisor Deane Dana, began "after I announced my 
candidacy in August."

MAKING CENTS OF FINE FAILS TO PAY OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Randall Cornelius wanted to put in his two cents' worth about a parking ticket 
he got in San Gabriel recently. Actually, he wanted to put in his 2,000 cents' 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
He did so last week, when he ambled into the San Gabriel police station with a 
box full of loose pennies to pay his $20 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Bock, Police Department records clerk, said Cornelius is not the first 
person to try to pay in pennies. In fact, it happens often enough that the 
department has instituted a policy against accepting loose change. "We don't 
have time to stand here and count pennies," Bock said. 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius, 28, who lives in Upland, maintains he was unfairly ticketed for 
overnight parking 
</P>
<P>
on a San Gabriel street. He said the city should post warning signs about the 
law. Bock said San Gabriel, like other cities with restrictions on overnight 
parking, posts signs at major entrances, but not on every street. 
</P>
<P>
Bock said Cornelius -- who is so far refusing to budge -- has a choice of 
paying his fine in easy-to-count money, or ignoring the citation, which would 
then be reported to the Department of Motor Vehicles, preventing Cornelius from 
renewing his car registration.

THE NEW CHAIRMAN ON THE BLOCK; 
</P>
<P>
MALIBU: FRANK AND BARBARA SINATRA ARE THE MOST RECENT CELEBRITIES TO BUY A HOME 
ON STAR-STUDDED BROAD BEACH. THEY PAID $3 MILLION FOR A TEAR-DOWN. 
</P>

<P>
In most places, Frank Sinatra's moving to the neighborhood would be big news. 
</P>
<P>
But not along Malibu's star-studded Broad Beach, where the entertainer just 
spent $3 million for a two-story house that he and wife Barbara want to tear 
down and replace with a 7,000-square-foot home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they chose there because everyone else is there, and, of course, 
because of the ocean," Sinatra publicist Susan Reynolds said of the couple's 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission, which must approve such matters, is expected 
to give the go-ahead for the tear-down today at its meeting in San Diego. The 
commission staff has recommended approval. 
</P>
<P>
If the Sinatras, who have a home in Rancho Mirage, get their wish, they will be 
moving to a beachfront neighborhood that includes homes owned by Goldie Hawn, 
Carroll O'Connor, Jack Lemmon, Sylvester Stallone, Steven Spielberg, Walter 
Matthau, Dinah Shore, Dustin Hoffman, Danny DeVito and Rhea Pearlman, and Dick 
Martin, among others. 
</P>
<P>
"It (Broad Beach) has really become a place of preference for a growing number 
of celebrities," real estate broker and longtime Malibu resident Louis T. Busch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate brokers and others say that Broad Beach, which is in the western 
portion of the 20-mile-long community, has become the hottest celebrity haven 
in Malibu during the last five years, rivaling the more famous -- and heavily 
secured -- Malibu Colony. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who prefer a little more security and convenience tend to favor the 
Colony, while those who want more space and a little better beach tend to go 
for Broad Beach," real estate broker Jack Pritchett said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the influx of celebrities have come higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
For example, among houses for sale along the two-mile stretch of Broad Beach, 
it is exceptional to find anything below $5 million, brokers say. A home where 
screen star Merle Oberon once lived, with 105 feet of beachfront -- as opposed 
to the usual 40 feet -- recently went on the market for $8.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
"These are extremely nice places, but they're not palatial residences," said 
one broker, who did not want to be identified. "For the most part, they are 
houses where there isn't enough room for a tennis court, but where you can 
squeeze in a pool." 
</P>
<P>
So what's the lure? 
</P>
<P>
"The beach itself is wonderful, with big sand dunes you don't find at other 
places," Busch said. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchett, whose firm handled the Sinatra sale, agrees.

COMMUNITY UNIT TO RUN AIDS CLINIC; 
</P>
<P>
WEST HOLLYWOOD: THE FACILITY, PREVIOUSLY OPERATED BY THE COUNTY, HAS LESS THAN 
HALF ITS EXPECTED PATIENT LOAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A West Hollywood community organization will take over operation of an AIDS 
clinic that served only about half the number of patients it was supposed to 
during the 21 months it was operated by the Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
Answering pleas from AIDS organizations that began in April, the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors this week approved an agreement passing control of 
the West Hollywood HIV Clinic to the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood-based social service agency will assume control of the clinic at 
621 N. San Vicente Blvd. over the next two months. Administrators said they 
plan to more than double the patient load, which has lagged at between 400 and 
500, and to expand pharmacy hours, provide chest X-rays, and speed patient care 
by adding personnel and a computer system. 
</P>
<P>
When it opened in May, 1989, the West Hollywood clinic was touted as a model 
program that would provide patients infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus with drugs and counseling, before they developed the debilitating 
symptoms of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. It is the only program of its 
kind in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
But the clinic, which primarily serves low-income patients, never reached the 
minimum caseload of 850 envisioned by health officials. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Frangenberg, director of the county's AIDS programs, blamed the service 
shortfall on a dearth of qualified nurses. The facility was to be served by 
four full-time nurses but usually had only two or three on the payroll, 
according to a clinic employee. 
</P>
<P>
But AIDS activists also said county mismanagement limited the capacity of the 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"The AIDS-affected community gave up on the county providing care and decided 
to do it ourselves," said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare 
Foundation. "The fact is, the county and state will not take responsibility for 
early intervention." 
</P>
<P>
Jean Murphy, the clinic's new program director, said the facility was plagued 
by several problems: three management changes in the last year, the lack of a 
staff member who knew how to run the clinic computer and inadequate plans for 
routing patients to the facility's various programs. 
</P>
<P>
Frangenberg said those assertions were exaggerated or untrue. He said the 
takeover by the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center should not be viewed 
"as an admission that we are not doing as good a job." 
</P>
<P>
Frangenberg conceded, however, that the new management should help the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"With a community organization, we will have community support for the service 
and maximize the energy and resources available in the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, which has provided health 
services and a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases for 17 years, was 
granted a two-year contract to operate the West Hollywood clinic at Tuesday's 
Board of Supervisors meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The center will receive $2.1 million from the county to provide the services, 
with expected contract extensions if the agency operates the clinic 
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said equipment has just been installed that soon should provide X-ray 
screening for pneumonia. The clinic pharmacy should be open next week for 32 
hours, rather than the previous 10 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said that as soon as possible the clinic will begin to treat about 200 
patients who were initially diagnosed at the Edelman Health Clinic in Hollywood 
but had nowhere to turn for AZT and other early treatments.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: PACIFIC PALISADES; 
</P>
<P>
CHANGES FOR 2 SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palisades High will become a four-year school next year and Paul Revere Junior 
High will add sixth grade under a reconfiguration plan approved by the Los 
Angeles Unified School District Board. 
</P>
<P>
The reconfiguration is a way for the schools in the Palisades area to take on 
23% more students, as required by the district, without the grade schools 
having to go on a staggered year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible in the area because there is empty space available at the junior 
and senior high schools. Moving the sixth grade to Revere makes space for the 
growing population of elementary school students in kindergarten through fifth 
grade. The ninth grade then is bumped up to the high school. 
</P>
<P>
Parents in the area supported the reconfiguration, rather than having each 
elementary school struggle with the need to increase capacity. Also, current 
educational research favors a sixth-to-eighth grade middle school as best for 
serving the needs of this age group. 
</P>
<P>
The elementary schools involved in the reconfiguration are Canyon, Kenter 
Canyon, Marquez and Pacific Palisades.

CITY AID FOR AILING MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of Hen's Teeth Square was saved from foreclosure on the 
27,500-square-foot shopping center when the Board of Directors approved more 
financial aid Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which leases space at the Woodbury Road center for $10,920 monthly, 
will extend the lease for three years with a $131,040 advance payment of one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
It will also guarantee for a year to meet owner Jeanette Henderson's mortgage 
payment to Heartland Savings &amp; Loan Assn. if she falls behind. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city will extend for three years an outstanding $176,000 in 
city loans to Henderson and will defer installment payments on it until July 1, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
The city loan in 1981 was to promote business in Northwest Pasadena, the city's 
largest minority neighborhood. But after Henderson fell behind in her mortgage 
payments, she asked the city for help.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: MARINA DEL REY;

<P>
PARKING LOT RATES INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county's Small Craft Harbor Commission Wednesday endorsed doubling the 
parking rates from $1 to $2 at some lots in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory commission voted 4 to 0 to urge the Board of Supervisors to 
approve the increase to bring marina parking rates in line with charges at 
private lots in the marina area. 
</P>
<P>
The increase will generate an estimated $221,000 a year in additional revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Summer parking rates at Marina Beach parking lots will remain $5 during the 
day, but the summer rate after 6 p.m. would rise from $1 to $2. The $2 rate 
would also apply during the day in non-summer months, and the entry fee at 
other marina parking lots would increase from $1 to $2.

<P>
Major home additions, including second stories, must now be authorized by the 
city's Architectural Review Board, the City Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A current ban on second story additions, passed by the council in July, will 
expire Jan. 15. After that, second story additions and additions of more than 
600 square feet must be approved by the board. The board will notify immediate 
neighbors before making any decisions on second stories. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, unanimously approved Tuesday, second stories must now be 
located at least 20 feet from back-yard property lines. The old requirement was 
five feet.

A month after liberalizing a temporary limit on the size of additions to 
single-family homes, the City Council went back to the old, stricter 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the council voted 5 to 0 to limit room additions to 50% of existing 
floor area. The strict rules, originally adopted in October, were eased Nov. 12 
to allow additions on a sliding scale ranging from 100% to 200% of the original 
floor area, depending on lot size. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance will be in effect until September. Permanent guidelines are 
being prepared.

In a letter to City Manager Robert L. Poff, the company cited cost-of-living

Despite regionwide appeals to conserve, Glendora's water usage increased by 
about 2% so far this year, compared to the same period last year, a city 
official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Larry Glenn said he found the increase "really appalling," and 
suggested that the city prepare a report on ways to cut water use. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday asked city staff members to prepare such a report, 
including a contingency plan for mandatory water rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Marshall Mouw suggested that the study, to be completed by 
mid-January, also consider the effect of development on water use.

<TEXT>
<P>
For a sweet taste of Old California, try Saturday's do-it-yourself orange 
picking at La Verne's Heritage Park. 
</P>
<P>
Right behind the park's 100-year-old Weber House are about 300 citrus trees, 
most fairly bursting with ripe navel oranges. 
</P>
<P>
The entire La Verne area used to be filled with orange and lemon groves, and 
the self-serve harvest is meant to remind people of that time, as well as to 
raise money for the park, said Craig Walters, president of the La Verne 
Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a citrus grove, the park includes a stand of pepper trees, a 
children's play area, an expansive, centuries-old oak tree, and a World War I 
vintage barn that houses restroom facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The historic house and barn were moved to the site. The orange trees are the 
last from an actual grove. They were saved 
</P>
<P>
through the care of a former citrus ranch hand who watered the trees on his own 
for years before the city took up active maintenance of the park. 
</P>
<P>
There is no entrance fee, and the oranges are cheap -- $4 for a 10-pound bag 
that you can fill yourself or allow volunteers to fill for you. Many oranges 
are hanging low enough for small children to reach. 
</P>
<P>
And there is no extra fee should you decide to pick up a paintbrush and help 
volunteers whitewash the old barn, an activity also scheduled for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The plucking and painting will last from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Because oranges ripen 
according to their own schedule, there'll be more picking allowed on Jan. 5, 
and on alternate Saturdays until the fruit is gone. 
</P>
<P>
The park is on Via De Mansion, just east of Wheeler Avenue. HOWARD BLUME

<TEXT>
<P>
The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has committed $300,000 to support minority 
student programs at UCLA's John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation's support, to be given in $100,000 installments over the next 
three years, will provide for several new initiatives to augment existing 
minority programs at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Among the programs that will be supported by the Sloan grant are: a two-week 
program of instruction made available to minority students in preparation for 
courses in the first quarter of the Master of Business Administration degree 
program; curricular enrichment sessions in selected courses available to 
African-American, Latino and Native American MBA students, and an initiative to 
bring minority speakers to the UCLA campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Sloan Foundation was established in 1934 by Alfred P. Sloan Jr., former 
chairman of General Motors Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The Anderson School, which is involved in a several efforts to diversify its 
student population, will hold its annual MBA information day for minority 
applicants on Jan. 12 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the UCLA Faculty Center. For

EMPLOYEES GET PAY RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved 5.5% salary increases for the coming year for 
city management employees. 
</P>
<P>
The 5.5% raise is to be followed in 1992 and 1993 by increases based on the 
Consumer Price Index, under a three-year agreement reached between the city and 
management group employees and approved by the council Monday. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 employees are covered, including the directors of community 
development, human services and transportation departments, senior accountants 
and the city engineer, said Personnel Manager Gordon Youngs. The raise is 
retroactive to Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, management employees were given a 4.5% pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
Certain upper-level management employees classified in a separate personnel 
category, such as Youngs, the city attorney, deputy city attorneys, the chief 
administrative officer and the city clerk, were given 5.5% pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
With the raise, Youngs earns $6,203 a month, Chief Administrative Officer Dale 
Jones, $8,925, City Atty. Eleanor Egan, $8,491, and Community Development 
Director Jody Hall-Esser, $6,819, Youngs said. City Clerk Pauline C. Dolce and 
Treasurer Sue McCabe each earn $5,843 monthly. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy city attorneys make $5,315 per month. 
</P>
<P>
The vote for the pay raises was 3 to 2, with Councilman James D. Boulgarides 
and Mayor Steven Gourley saying they opposed the increases because of the 
city's tight budget. Gourley said the raises may lead to layoffs in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gourley voted for the increases for the city clerk and treasurer, 
saying that elected officials' salaries lag behind their capabilities and 
qualifications.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MISSING LOOT INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is investigating the disappearance of 
$14,000 from a safe in the Glendora Police Department last month. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Art Cook said he called in the Sheriff's Department to investigate 
the apparent theft of the money, which was being held as evidence. He said it 
was part of the loot retrieved after a robbery of the Foothill Employees 
Federal Credit Union on Foothill Boulevard. Cook said the money was found to be 
missing from the Police Department in early November. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendora City Council on Tuesday voted unanimously to reimburse the credit 
union for its loss.

2 MEN KIDNAPED, 1 KILLED ON REMOTE MALIBU ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men drinking in a Santa Ana bar were kidnaped, robbed and taken to a remote 
Malibu canyon road, where one was fatally shot execution-style and the other 
escaped unharmed by bolting into the brush, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police on Wednesday identified the shooting victim as Augustine Mejia Lucero, 
25, of Santa Ana. He died of a single gunshot wound to the back of the head, 
apparently by a handgun fired at close range, Santa Ana Police spokeswoman 
Maureen Haacker said. 
</P>
<P>
The motive for the slaying was "apparently robbery, since the victims were 
robbed of their belongings while they were in the car," Haacker said. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to disclose other details, including the name of the surviving 
kidnap victim and the name of the bar, because they said it could jeopardize 
the investigation. Police have no suspects, Haacker said. 
</P>
<P>
The abduction occurred about 10:30 p.m. Sunday, when Lucero and a companion 
were taken from a bar in the area of 5th Street and Harbor Boulevard and forced 
into a red car by two armed men, Haacker said. 
</P>
<P>
After driving the victims around for more than three hours, the kidnapers took 
them to Decker Road about a quarter-mile north of Pacific Coast Highway, and 
made them get out of the car and kneel by the side of the road, Pitkin said. 
</P>
<P>
After Lucero was shot, his companion became terrified and bolted into the 
brush, said Sgt. Tom Pitkin, watch commander for the Malibu station of the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which is assisting in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an execution," Pitkin said. ". . . When the survivor saw them execute 
his friend, he just bailed and headed down the hill." 
</P>
<P>
The survivor, who apparently eluded his captors for about four hours in the 
dense brush, was described as a Salvadoran national between the ages of 25 and 
30. Decker Road, in the area where the man made his escape, is one of the 
steepest and most remote roads in the Malibu area, Pitkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The survivor waited until daylight Monday and then flagged down a passing 
motorist, Pitkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the shooting, county sheriff's deputies and Santa Ana police have 
uncovered few clues they say they can discuss publicly, and many questions they 
haven't been able to answer. 
</P>
<P>
"We are perplexed as to why the suspects would drive all that way," Haacker 
said. "There are a number of things we are trying to find out." 
</P>
<P>
Another police official, who asked not to be named, also questioned why the 
kidnapers drove their victims around for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
"This begs the question: If they were just going to rob them, why drive all 
that way?" asked one officer, who asked not to be identified. "And why kill 
them over a robbery? I would suspect they were looking for more than just what 
these (victims) had on them." 
</P>
<P>
Police have not said what type of gun was used. They said the only clue left at 
the scene was a pair of surgical gloves, apparently used to prevent 
fingerprints from being left.

FOX OFFERS PLAN TO EASE STUDIO TRAFFIC; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE STUDIO REPORTS THAT IT WOULD SPEND $5 MILLION TO ALLEVIATE THE 
DOUBLING OF TRAFFIC CAUSED BY STUDIO'S EXPANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A preliminary study has concluded that 20th Century Fox's proposed expansion 
would cause studio traffic to double, but still remain well within the limits 
allowed by the Century City land-use plan. 
</P>
<P>
The study released by Fox on Wednesday contends that the 8,050 new daily 
vehicle trips that the expanded studio facility would generate can be mitigated 
"to a level of insignificance" by about $5 million worth of improvements, which 
Fox would pay for. They range from installing improved traffic signals and turn 
lanes to widening freeway on-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
All estimates were based on the times when the studio will be running at full 
tilt. Because of cyclic production schedules, this is about a third of the 
year, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Fox had planned to convert the historic movie lot between Pico and 
Olympic boulevards to high-rise condominiums and move its operations somewhere 
on the fringes of Los Angeles, where land is cheaper. Now it wants to 
consolidate its entertainment empire in West Los Angeles, moving KTTV 
operations from Hollywood and adding 771,000 square feet of space to the 1.1 
million already built. There would be 4,500 parking spots at Fox when it is 
fully expanded. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic analysis, prepared by Crain &amp; Associates for Fox, was presented 
Wednesday to an ad hoc traffic committee composed of homeowner-group 
representatives, who will advise their associations on the traffic issue, which 
all agree is the greatest problem posed by an expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Fox has paid for a separate consultant to assist the committee, and the report 
is certain to be closely scrutinized by suspicious homeowners concerned about 
their residential streets, which already are used as thoroughfares by many 
commuters to Century City. 
</P>
<P>
The city Department of Transportation will also conduct a review of the Fox 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Fox Vice President David Handelman said in a written release that the expanded 
studio is a better deal for the community than condominiums, which would create 
a steady stream of traffic. During the two-thirds of the year when the studio 
is not in full production, residents would have a respite, but still have the 
advantage of the traffic mitigation measures installed by Fox, Handelman said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Fox figures, the studio now generates about 7,720 daily trips 
and will generate 15,770 when the studio is fully expanded. Under the Century 
City Specific Plan, 16,120 trips are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
During the peak hour of morning traffic, the studio expansion would add 1,140 
more cars to the nearby roadways. The afternoon peak load would be increased by 
1,025 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
At peak hours, the streets most affected would include Motor Avenue, a 
residential street that cuts though Cheviot Hills; Pico Boulevard; Olympic 
Boulevard; Avenue of the Stars, and Overland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Also extensively affected would be Galaxy Way and Empyrean Way in Century City, 
and the intersection of Monte Mar near Beverwil Drive, which is east of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the intersections studied in the report are already seriously clogged, 
the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
If it can obtain the zone changes required for its expansion, Fox wants to 
close the main entrance to the studio on Pico Boulevard at Motor Avenue. But 
there will be a driveway and traffic signal west of Motor on Pico to allow 
entrance to an 800-space parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
Under Fox's proposal, most traffic would enter the expanded facility from the 
east, via Avenue of the Stars. Plans call for a 2,800-space parking garage 
there -- serving most employees -- and reached by Galaxy Way. There also is to 
be an entrance from Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The studio said it can cut its daily trips to less than 15,000 by implementing 
a car- and van-pooling plan, and by providing on-site services, such as 
automatic teller machines. The company also plans to bring in its audiences for 
television shows by bus.

CITY TO HELP REBUILDING PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
SIERRA MADRE: PROPERTY OWNERS PLANNING TO ERECT THREE BUILDINGS ON SITE HIT BY 
FIRE LAST YEAR WILL GET REDEVELOPMENT FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A year after fire gutted five businesses and a small apartment building in 
Sierra Madre's historic downtown, city officials Tuesday approved giving 
Community Redevelopment Agency assistance to property owners planning a 
half-million-dollar rebuilding project. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, doubling as the Community Redevelopment Agency, agreed to 
provide aid to the property owners, although the precise level of assistance 
has to be determined. The city obligation would include $80,000 in assistance 
with loan interest payments and $40,000 for purchasing certain land rights, a 
city report said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has already spent $20,000 on design drawings, City Manager James E. 
McRea said. But property owners Fred Crocket, Helen Elliott and Berge Yeghiaian 
have agreed to reimburse the city if the project is approved. 
</P>
<P>
The property owners will obtain their own financing to build three two-story 
buildings on their land at 14-22 W. Sierra Madre Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The new buildings will be almost twice the size of the single-story shops that 
stood there and will require more parking than the site can provide, McRea 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed projects, which will include restaurants and a reincarnation of 
Elliott's Spinning Wheel gift shop, are 10 spaces short of the 24 parking 
spaces required for a development that size, McRea said. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for a break on the parking requirement, Crocket, Elliott and 
Yeghiaian said they are willing to give the city a 20-foot easement at the rear 
of their property for sewer lines, utilities and public access. 
</P>
<P>
To take advantage of the easement, the city would have to purchase certain 
rights to some neighboring land, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The property owners will also offer five parking spaces somewhere off the site, 
McRea said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 6, 1989, fire marred the area's Christmas season last year, and 
Crocket, Elliott and Yeghiaian said they had hoped to be in business in time 
for the holidays this year. 
</P>
<P>
McRea said the property owners qualify for CRA assistance because their 
property is in an area that has been declared a redevelopment zone since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this will be the start of the rehabilitation of the downtown area," 
McRea said. 
</P>
<P>
The project will come back to the Redevelopment Agency for a resolution of the 
parking problem, determination of the agency's exact level of participation, 
and final approval of the new buildings' design.

COLLEGE NEWS: CALTECH PROFESSOR GETS $500,000 GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Caltech astronomy professor is one of 20 young scientists nationwide to be 
awarded a fellowship that provides him with $500,000 in unrestricted funds to 
support his research over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Shrinivas Kulkarni, 34, an associate professor of astronomy, received the David 
and Lucile Packard Foundation Fellowship from the Los Altos-based foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena resident received his master's degree in 1978 from the Indian 
Institute in New Delhi and his doctorate from UC Berkeley in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
He came to Caltech in 1985 as a Robert A. Millikan Research Fellow and became 
an assistant professor in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Kulkarni was named a Booker Fellow for exceptional contributions to 
radio astronomy, and in 1988, he was named both a Presidential Young 
Investigator by the National Science Foundation and a Sloan Research Fellow by 
the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation of New York City. He was recently awarded the 
Vainu Bappu Memorial Prize. 
</P>
<P>
Kulkarni's research is principally concerned with observational studies of 
pulsars, or neutron stars, and the development of astronomical instrumentation. 
</P>
<P>
The Packard Fellowship program was started in 1988 by the Los Altos-based 
foundation to encourage talented young faculty members to pursue productive 
university careers. 
</P>
<P>
Kulkarni is the fourth Caltech faculty member to be named a Packard Fellow.

WACHS REJECTS PLAN FOR PARK TO BE PERMANENT DOG HAVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles city councilman this week rejected a proposal to make permanent 
Laurel Canyon Park's unique status as a haven where dogs can run free. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan offered by Councilman Joel Wachs, the grant of leash-free 
privileges at Laurel Canyon Park would need to be renewed each year by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs was sitting as the lone member present of the Arts, Health and Humanities 
Committee. His plan, which next goes to the full City Council, was not good 
news for dog owners, who want the city to take over more of the responsibility 
and cost of operating the four-acre park. 
</P>
<P>
"We want more meat on our plate for our work," said Jane Purse, founder of 
ParkWatch, a private group that has worked with recreation officials to make 
Laurel Canyon Park the city's first -- and to date only -- park in which dogs 
can run free of leashes. 
</P>
<P>
Purse's group has contributed time and money to make Laurel Canyon Park 
successful as a dog park, expecting that as a reward the city would make the 
leash-free privilege permanent. 
</P>
<P>
ParkWatch has extensively educated dog owners on their legal duties to clean up 
their animals' feces, pays $65 per day to have a ranger patrol the park on 
weekends and holidays when patronage is highest, and conducts cleanup 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The park has operated as a leash-free zone on a pilot basis since August, 1988, 
with dogs permitted to run free from 7 to 10 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to sundown 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
The initial exemption from the city's leash law for park users was for six 
months. Since then, the exemption has been extended every six months. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people feel that the reason you are doing such a good job is that you 
have something to gain," Wachs told Purse. "You have an incentive. I want to 
make sure you keep doing your share." 
</P>
<P>
Wachs also won an important endorsement for his plan from Diana Brueggemann, an 
aide to Councilman Michael Woo. Woo represents the area, and his views are 
likely to be influential when the plan comes to a vote by the full council.

NEW SNAG IN FRYMAN CANYON DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY SAYS THE SWAP MIGHT BE 
ILLEGAL AND COULD REQUIRE THE AGENCY TO PAY $61,000 MORE THAN AGREED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted 12 to 2 this week to approve an estimated 
$10-million-plus deal to buy Fryman Canyon for a park, but the elation of 
environmental activists was quickly dampened when a state official said the 
plan contains a "poison pill provision" that threatens the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Zeidner, press secretary for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, said 
the council-approved deal is possibly illegal and could require the state parks 
agency to pay $61,150 more than agreed to Fryman Canyon owner Fred Sahadi. 
</P>
<P>
"The conservancy can't accept these terms," Zeidner said. The conservancy and 
the city would jointly put up money to buy the 63-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to the council action 
left city officials such as Councilman Michael Woo, in whose district the 
property is located, stunned and baffled. "I don't understand," he said as he 
ordered his staff to look into it. 
</P>
<P>
"Incredible" is how Jane Blumenfeld, Mayor Tom Bradley's top planning deputy 
and a Fryman watcher, described the latest twist in the tortuous negotiations 
and controversy that have surrounded the effort to purchase the scenic canyon, 
which lies just north of Mulholland Drive and west of Laurel Canyon Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Woo said he was "not overly concerned about this -- I think it can be 
worked out. I don't see this as a deal-breaker." 
</P>
<P>
Zeidner, however, refused to say whether the council plan means that the 
purchase of Fryman Canyon for a park has been irrevocably quashed. 
</P>
<P>
She accused the city of adding the new provision as a way to put the 
conservancy in the position of scuttling the deal. "Maybe this is a PR stunt to 
put the onus for killing the deal on the conservancy," Zeidner said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston has also 
complained bitterly that the city has been willing to overpay Sahadi. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan approved Tuesday, the city and the parks agency would pay Sahadi 
about $10 million to $10.4 million -- the exact value depends on how much four 
city-owned properties that Sahadi is to get in return from the city are worth. 
</P>
<P>
The last state-sanctioned appraisal said the Fryman property was worth $8.75 
million. But an earlier appraisal, partly paid for by the conservancy, set the 
value at $13.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
During the council debate, objections to the deal came from council members 
Joan Milke Flores, Ruth Galanter, Ernani Bernardi and Zev Yaroslavsky. They 
were disturbed that the city attorney's office was unable to assure the council 
that it was legal for the city to participate in a deal that may have involved 
paying the developer more than the appraised value for his property. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who voted for the deal, said later that he felt ambivalent about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this does not set a precedent for acquiring or negotiating acquisitions 
of parkland for prices above appraised value," he said. "I voted for this. But 
it was close enough and ambiguous enough that it would've been wrong to stand 
in the way of such an important park purchase. Some day, the difference between 
the appraised value and the negotiated price may be much greater." 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy's board of directors approved the purchase plan last week. That 
plan and the one adopted by the council have the following elements in common: 
</P>
<P>
* The conservancy would pay $6.7 million to Sahadi. 
</P>
<P>
* The Department of Water and Power would deed the four parcels to Sahadi. The 
parcels, totaling about 10 acres, include two sites in Pacific Palisades, one 
in Woodland Hills and one in the Calabasas Highlands. The value of the four 
parcels has been variously estimated at $1.2 million or $1.65 million. 
</P>
<P>
* The city and the conservancy would authorize the payment of an additional 
$1.96 million to the developer. This money would be borrowed from the Runyon 
Canyon trust fund, set up to buy parkland in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
* To repay the Runyon Canyon fund, the DWP would deed over a fifth parcel it 
owns next to Marquez School in Pacific Palisades to the conservancy. The 
conservancy would sell this property to raise money to reimburse the Runyon 
account. 
</P>
<P>
Under the city plan, the first $61,150 in revenue from that sale would go to 
the DWP. That amount is what the utility originally paid for the parcels. It is 
also effectively what the parcels are worth to the utility because state law 
requires the DWP -- if it elects to sell -- to sell surplus land to the 
conservancy at its original cost. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with that payment is that it appears to involve the conservancy as 
a kind of go-between in deeding the four parcels to Sahadi, Zeidner said. The 
conservancy does not want to be so implicated because it is barred by law from 
paying any more out of its own coffers for the property than the $8.75-million 
appraisal, Zeidner said. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, however, said he believed that the deal adequately insulates the 
conservancy from any charges of wrongdoing.

TALENTED BISHOP AMAT DOMINATES VALLEY TEAM WITH 4 PLAYERS;

FOOTBALL: POWERFUL MUIR, NOGALES ARE RIGHT BEHIND WITH THREE EACH. GLENDORA HAS

<P>
For the Bishop Amat High football team, it was a season in which the Lancers 
more than lived up to their successful tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having mostly juniors in its starting lineup, Bishop Amat captured its 
sixth consecutive Angelus League title and reached the CIF Southern Section 
Division I quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
So it is hardly a surprise that the talent-rich Lancers lead the way with four 
first-team and two second-team selections for The Times' 1990 All-San Gabriel 
Valley All-Star High School Football Team. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 46 players selected, Bishop Amat placed offensive lineman John 
Ludwiczak, running back Scott Fields, linebacker Jason Patterson and defensive 
back Mike Velasco on the first team and linebackers Miregi Huma and Peter Gomez 
on the second team. 
</P>
<P>
Three other valley powers -- Muir, Nogales and Glendora -- were right behind 
Bishop Amat. Muir and Nogales each had three players on the first team and one 
on the second unit. Glendora had two on the first team and three on the second 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
Division II quarterfinalist Muir placed quarterback Sedrick Thomas and 
defensive backs Reggie Reser and Demetrice Martin on the first team and 
receiver Ron Jones on the second unit. 
</P>
<P>
Nogales, which advanced to the Division IV quarterfinals and finished 10-1, 
placed offensive lineman Todd Wild, running back Tyrone Edwards and linebacker 
Luis Cuevas on the first team and defensive lineman Tony Verran made the second 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora, which reached the Division IV semifinals and finished 12-2, placed 
running back Bill Zernickow and defensive back Tim Flynn on the first squad and 
offensive linemen Kirk Bowman and Don Liddell and defensive back Josh Romero on 
the second team. 
</P>
<P>
The only other school with more than one player on the first team is Baldwin 
Park with offensive lineman Peter Medrano and linebacker Fernando Arredondo. 
The Braves, who advanced to the Division IV finals for the first time since 
1984, also added defensive lineman Jerry Sims to the second unit. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino has one player on the first team and two on the second and Rosemead, 
Claremont, Temple City and Blair each has one on the first and another on the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
There are 22 schools represented on the first and second teams. 
</P>
<P>
Zernickow, Arcadia kicker Neil Voskeritchian and Damien defensive lineman Mike 
Balian are first-team repeaters from last year. Fields is the only junior on 
the first team. 
</P>
<P>
The selections were based on a poll of 49 11-man coaches in The Times' San 
Gabriel Valley circulation area, which covers the San Gabriel and Pomona 
valleys. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley player, lineman and coach of the year -- whose names 
have yet to be announced -- will be honored at a breakfast and awards ceremony 
at 8:30 a.m. Sunday at the Anaheim Hilton Hotel &amp; Towers, 777 Convention 
Way. 
</P>
<P>
The invitational event, sponsored by the Los Angeles Times Fund, is only for 
the 36 winners of the highest awards from 12 Times circulation areas: San 
Gabriel Valley, Westside, Central Los Angeles, Orange County, Southeast, South 
Coast, Glendale, Centinela-South Bay, San Fernando Valley, San Diego County, 
Inland Empire (Riverside and San Bernardino counties) and Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the valley is stocked with outstanding running backs and in 1990, 
all three running backs on the first team rushed for 1,300 yards or more. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way was Glendora's Zernickow, a 6-foot, 205-pound tailback who 
played an essential role in his team's 24-3-1 record the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Zernickow ran for 1,594 yards and 17 touchdowns as a senior after rushing for 
1,761 yards and 17 touchdowns as a junior. A flanker as a sophomore, he 
finished his career with 3,538 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
He also made an impact in spot duty on defense, where he was a lineman and 
back. He had eight quarterback sacks, two interceptions -- including one that 
he returned for a touchdown -- and a fumble that he also returned for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
An All-Division IV selection as a junior, Zernickow has been recruited by 
numerous NCAA Division I colleges including Colorado, Washington, Brigham 
Young, Nevada Las Vegas and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Another running back who capped a brilliant prep career was Edwards, who is 6-2 
and 185 pounds with 4.4-second speed in the 40-yard dash. Edwards rushed for 
1,285 yards and 12 touchdowns in 166 carries -- an average of 7.7 yards a carry 
-- to lead Nogales to an undefeated regular season and its best record in 
school history. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who also rushed for 1,100 yards as a junior, was rewarded by being 
named to the All-Sierra League first team for the second consecutive year and 
the league's athlete of the year in football. 
</P>
<P>
An outstanding all-around athlete, who is one of the top long jumpers in the 
Southern Section, Edwards has been recruited by major colleges including USC, 
UC Berkeley, UCLA and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest member of the backfield is Fields of Bishop Amat, but he could 
develop into the best of the group. At 6-3 and 200 pounds, he is the latest in 
a line of exceptional running backs to attend the La Puente school. Others have 
included Eric Bieniemy of Colorado and Mazio Royster of USC. 
</P>
<P>
In his first year as a varsity tailback, Fields rushed for 1,416 yards and 15 
touchdowns in 176 carries -- an average of eight yards a carry. He also had six 
receptions for 66 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
He was also one of the team's defensive leaders on the line with an 
interception, three quarterback sacks and three fumble recoveries including one 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But the most versatile member of the backfield may have been Muir's Thomas, an 
exceptional passer and rusher who also handled the punting chores for the 
Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas completed 87 of 132 passes for 1,991 yards and 19 touchdowns with only 
five interceptions. At 6-0 and 210 pounds, he also used his 4.5 speed in the 40 
to rush for 740 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
A part-time starter at quarterback and a starter at linebacker as a junior, 
Thomas is regarded as one of the valley's top college prospects. Colorado, USC, 
UCLA, UC Berkeley, Oklahoma and Washington are some of the schools recruiting 
the two-time All-Pacific League selection. 
</P>
<P>
Chang Weisberg of Rosemead was the leading pass-catcher in the valley this year 
with 64 receptions for 1,089 yards and eight touchdowns. He also caught 60 
passes for 811 yards and nine touchdowns as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
An excellent pitcher and outfielder for the school's baseball team, the 6-0 and 
180-pound Weisberg is being recruited to play football by Hawaii, San Diego 
State, Pacific and UC Davis. A safety on defense, he was a two-time All-Mission 
Valley League selection. 
</P>
<P>
Another elusive passing target for defensive backs is Charles Carr of Blair, 
the first player on the Vikings to make the first team in recent years. At 6-0 
and 170 pounds, Carr made a big impression by catching 49 passes for 823 yards 
and 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Carr also made a major contribution in the defensive backfield with five 
interceptions and returned one for a touchdown. He was a two-time All-Rio Hondo 
League selection. 
</P>
<P>
The first-team kicker, Arcadia's Voskeritchian, was also selected as a junior. 
Voskeritchian earned another all-star selection with his exceptional range and 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Voskeritchian, 5-9 and 160 pounds, made eight field goals including a 
school-record 50-yarder. He made all 23 of his conversion attempts. He also 
booted 32 of 34 kickoffs into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
That was similar to his success as a junior when he made eight field goals and 
32 extra points for 56 points. He is being recruited by Stanford, USC, 
Washington State, Oregon and Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive line is as big as usual with an average weight of 230 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most imposing players is Chad Ventriglia of Claremont, a 6-4, 
240-pound guard who is regarded as one of the best blockers in the Baseline 
League. In addition to making all-league on offense, he also caused a fumble 
and had four quarterback sacks to earn all-league selection at defensive 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Considered a Division I college prospect, he is being recruited by Brigham 
Young, Arizona, Kansas and Idaho State. 
</P>
<P>
The smallest member of the line is Wild of Nogales, who is 5-9 and 190 pounds. 
But he has anchored the offensive line as a starting guard for the Nobles the 
past three seasons. He also made the All-Sierra League team as a senior and was 
the team's kicker. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most heavily recruited player on the line is Steve Chiasson of 
Wilson, a 6-4, 240-pound center who also made All-Sierra League as a defensive 
tackle. He is being recruited by USC, Oklahoma, Washington State, Louisiana 
State, Nebraska and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
A preseason all-state selection by Cal-Hi Sports News, Chiasson was among the 
league leaders on defense with nine sacks and 77 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Another top college prospect on the line is Baldwin Park's Medrano. At 6-3 and 
241 pounds, Medrano starred at offensive and defensive tackle for the Braves. 
He was the team's best blocker on offense and was among Baldwin Park's sack 
leaders on defense with six. 
</P>
<P>
A two-time All-Sierra League selection, Medrano is being recruited by USC, 
Colorado, Colorado State and UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
A factor in Bishop Amat's success over the years has been its talented 
offensive linemen. The 6-3, 230-pound Ludwiczak continued that tradition. He is 
an excellent blocker who received All-Sierra League honors the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
There is also plenty of size and ability on the defensive line, which averages 
220 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most successful was Nathan Olsen of San Marino, a fierce pass rusher 
who was selected defensive lineman of the year in the Rio Hondo League. A 
two-time all-league selection, the 6-3, 220-pound Olsen led the Titans with 13 
1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen, whose father Merlin starred for the Rams and is a member of the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame, was called "the best defensive lineman I have ever 
coached," by San Marino Coach Bill Maloney. He is being recruited by Colorado, 
Stanford, Washington, UCLA and Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
At 6-0 and 185 pounds, James Robinson of Walnut is the smallest player on the 
defensive front. He was also one of the most difficult to block with team highs 
of nine sacks and three fumble recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
Selected as the Valle Vista League lineman of the year, Robinson is being 
recruited by UC Davis, UC Santa Barbara and Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest player in the interior line -- and perhaps the most sought-after 
college prospect -- is Damien's Balian, who is 6-4 and 255 pounds. A consensus 
preseason prep All-American and all-state selection, Balian lived up to his 
reputation with eight sacks, three fumble recoveries and five forced fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
The two-time All-Baseline League and all-valley selection is being recruited by 
Colorado, UC Berkeley, Arizona State, Washington and Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
Another blue-chip prospect on the line is Matt Gilmour of Temple City, who also 
excelled as an inside linebacker and as a tackle on offense. An outstanding 
all-around athlete, the 6-5, 220-pound Gilmour also starts on the school's 
basketball and baseball teams. 
</P>
<P>
But he has received the most attention as a football player. He is a two-time 
All-Rio Hondo League selection and a member of The Times' second team last 
year. He is being recruited by USC, Washington, Colorado and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The linebacker corps features Bishop Amat's Patterson, who also stood out at 
defensive end and fullback. At 6-0 and 210 pounds, he is hardly the biggest 
player on the squad, but was surely one of the most active. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, he led the valley with 18 quarterback sacks and had a team-leading 
18 blocked passes. On offense, he rushed for 761 yards and 10 touchdowns in 134 
carries and caught 22 passes for 307 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
His accomplishments did not go without notice from the powerful Angelus League, 
which selected him its most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Another top linebacker was Arredondo of Baldwin Park, who received all-league 
first-team honors on defense for the second year in a row. Arredondo, 6-foot 
and 195 pounds, was also a starting tight end for the Braves. He is being 
recruited by UC Davis and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Along with teammates Edwards and Wild, Cuevas has played an important role in 
Nogales' recent success. At 5-9 and 160, he was a three-year starter who was 
one of his team's leading tacklers as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
A two-time all-league choice, Cuevas was selected Sierra League defensive 
player of the year this season. 
</P>
<P>
On a talented Bishop Amat squad, Velasco may have been overshadowed by players 
such as Fields and Patterson. But the 5-11, 175-pound Velasco had statistics 
worthy of an all-valley selection. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did he lead the team with five interceptions, Velasco also recovered 
five fumbles, forced three fumbles and was one of the top tacklers for the 
Lancers. He was also chosen to the All-Angelus League first team. 
</P>
<P>
The secondary also features Glendora's Flynn, the leader of a defense that was 
one of the best in the valley. The 6-1, 190-pound Flynn led the Tartans with 
six interceptions and ranked among the leaders in tackles with 90. 
</P>
<P>
A second-team all-valley selection last year and a two-time All-Baseline League 
pick, Flynn was voted the league's most valuable defensive player. He is being 
recruited by UNLV, Oregon State, Washington State, Air Force and Army. 
</P>
<P>
The two most heavily recruited defensive backs in the valley this season are 
Muir's Reser and Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Reser, 5-10 and 175 pounds, is the Mustangs' career leader in interceptions 
with 11 and also has a reputation as one of the hardest-hitting defensive backs 
in the valley. He is the school's all-time leader in tackles with 241. 
</P>
<P>
Also a strong offensive player with 4.45 speed in the 40, Reser scored 14 
touchdowns in his prep career. Reser, a three-time All-Pacific League selection 
who made the all-valley second team the past two seasons, is considered one of 
the nation's premier college prospects at defensive back. He is being recruited 
by UC Berkeley, Colorado, Michigan State, USC, UCLA and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-10, 175-pound Martin was among the most versatile players in the valley. 
A starter at quarterback as a junior, he became a standout at defensive back 
and wide receiver as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was one of Muir's defensive leaders with three interceptions and 75 
tackles and caught 20 passes for 612 yards and 10 touchdowns -- an average of 
about 30 yards a catch. It's no wonder why he is being recruited by UC 
Berkeley, Colorado, Washington, Michigan State and USC.

THEY'LL BE HOMELESS FOR CHRISTMAS;

<P>
AN IRVINE EXHIBIT EMBRACES ITS SUBJECTS AND CHALLENGES VIEWERS' BIASES

Faced with the task of organizing an exhibit about homeless people, Dorrit Kirk 
Fitzgerald decided the idea of an arm's length examination was out of the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of doing an art for art's sake show where artists who are not homeless 
would interpret the homeless, I wanted to address the homeless community itself 
and let them show me the direction I needed to go," Fitzgerald said recently. 
</P>
<P>
The result is "Who I Am Not," at the Irvine Fine Arts Center through Feb. 3, 
which features 28 autobiographical photographs by 13 homeless people as well as 
works on the subject by others who are not homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The images by the homeless, people living at the Santa Ana Civic Center, form a 
straightforward, unsentimental statement about daily life: A child stands alone 
in the sunshine, a row of shopping carts is laden with belongings, friends chat 
and eat together, others clown in the street, a man wrapped in a blanket sleeps 
beneath a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald, the fine arts center's curator, arrived at an underpinning theme 
for the exhibit through hands-on research that proved revelatory. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, she began to distribute food and hygiene kits at the Santa Ana 
Civic Center with help from SPIN (Street People In Need), a nonprofit 
organization providing services to Orange County homeless who officials 
estimate number about 8,000. The experience, which led to friendships with 
homeless people she met, made her profoundly aware of her own deeply ingrained 
beliefs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to understand that I represented the typical person in the community 
that doesn't know and probably doesn't want to know about the homeless and I 
had to deal with my own bias and prejudice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through such a transformation myself along the way that I felt the most 
beneficial thing would be to do an exhibit about perception -- about how we see 
others, not just the homeless, but anyone we might see as 'other.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald attempted to convey her theme by juxtaposing photographs by 
non-homeless artists and other depictions of the homeless, such as newspaper 
cartoons with homeless people's photographs. These pictures were taken with 
cameras donated for the project by Fuji Photo Film USA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"It's evident that only the homeless can portray themselves as directly and 
humanistically as possible," Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Weinman, one of several officials Fitzgerald worked with to better 
understand the local homeless community, said he helped her to see a larger 
reality of the situation. Executive director of Irvine Temporary Housing, which 
provides homeless families with temporary housing and other services, Weinman 
introduced her to several homeless families in Featherly Regional Park in Yorba 
Linda. 
</P>
<P>
"Most feel the homeless are degenerate people that society has cast aside; just 
an enlarged picture of the old hobo, people who are lazy and don't want to 
work," Weinman said. "But homeless people are people with open minds and open 
hearts that just had a bad turn. They could be you or I or anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said she hopes to change viewers' consciousness. "If I could just 
change a person's thinking for a second so they aren't making a judgment 
filtered through bias . . . I don't look at anyone the same any more. My life 
has completely changed as a result of this show."

'MESSIAH' CHORUSES, 'AMAHL' AND 'A FEAST OF CAROLS'

This is a festive holiday week for Garden Grove Symphony music director Edward 
Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, he led the band in accompanying a Christmas tree-lighting 
ceremony at a local hotel, and on Saturday he will lead the orchestra in a 
holiday concert at the Don Wash Auditorium in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing with the orchestra will be the 110-member Southern California Mormon 
Choir to sing Randal Bass' "A Feast of Carols" and five choruses from Handel's 
"Messiah." 
</P>
<P>
The program also will include suites from Tchaikovsky's "Nutcracker" ballet and 
Menotti's "Amahl and the Night Visitors." 
</P>
<P>
Said Peterson: "The 'Feast of Carols' is not quite the usual 'Silent Night' and 
'O Come, All Ye Faithful.' It's made up of recognizable carols, but more unique 
ones, which are done very nicely with full orchestra backup with the choir." 
</P>
<P>
The excerpts from the "Messiah" will be a "sampling" of the famous work, the 
conductor said, with the Overture followed by "Glory to God," "For unto us a 
child is born," "Hallelujah!" "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain" and "Amen." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson has been de-jet-lagging after a recent trip to Inchon, Korea, where he 
led the Inchon City Symphony. His trip completed the second half of a 
conductor-exchange program that brought Won-Sik Lim, conductor for the Korean 
Broadcast Service in Seoul as well as the Inchon City Symphony, to lead the 
Garden Grove orchestra in September. 
</P>
<P>
Lim brought a program of Korean music to Garden Grove, and Peterson 
reciprocated by taking American music to Inchon in November. 
</P>
<P>
"Not too much American music is played in Korea," Peterson said. "I got the 
opportunity with that symphony to give its premiere performance of Copland's 
'Appalachian Spring.' 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised by the amount of English over there. I was expecting to 
have a lot more problems with getting around, and I had no idea what problems 
there would be in rehearsals. But more than half of the orchestra had a fairly 
decent command of English. 
</P>
<P>
"Storefront signs had characters in Korean and right under them, the words in 
English. It was easier than going into the Korean community in Los Angeles or 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"The only really negative thing was the traffic," he continued. "Seoul is such 
a hub of business that just about everyone has bought a car, and they're all 
out on the streets at the same time. It was only an 18-mile drive from Seoul 
(to Inchon), and I was chauffeured back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
"On a good day, the trip was an hour and a half. On a bad day, it was a 
three-hour drive getting back to the hotel. I'll never complain about the Los 
Angeles traffic again." 
</P>
<P>
What: A holiday concert by the Garden Grove Symphony and the Mormon Choir of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
When: Saturday, Dec. 15, at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Don Wash Auditorium, Euclid Street and Stanford Avenue, Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: Garden Grove Freeway to Euclid Street exit. North to Stanford 
Avenue (between Garden Grove Boulevard and Lampson Avenue); turn right. The 
auditorium will be on your left. 
</P>
<P>
Wherewithal: $10 to $25. 
</P>
<P>
Where to Call: (714) 534-1103.

LESSONS IN CONFIDENCE, GROWING UP AND HOLIDAY ENTERTAINMENT

Mark Henson graduated from high school 11 years ago, but he still hangs out 
with a pretty young crowd. 
</P>
<P>
A professional singer and voice instructor, the 28-year-old Henson directs the 
Young Entertainers, a nonprofit, North Orange County song-and-dance troupe of 
28 high school students. The youths, who receive free weekly vocal and movement 
training from Henson and other professionals, will present their annual holiday 
concert "Winter Winds" tonight through Saturday at Brea's Curtis Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Henson and his kids have literally grown up together. A 1980 graduate of 
Fullerton's Troy High School, he said he was dissatisfied with the "dwindling" 
music programs in his district and began looking for ways to give high 
schoolers ongoing training and performance opportunities. In 1981, at the age 
of 19, he enlisted the aid of former classmates and district music instructors 
and founded what would ultimately become the Young Entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
There were few public performances in those early years, but encouraged by high 
marks at two high school choral competitions, the Fullerton College Jazz 
Festival and San Diego's Tops in Pops event, the group continued to grow. 
Public interest grew as well, said Henson, and the group now entertains 
regularly at everything from civic festivals to corporate parties. The 
Christmas show is the group's seventh annual at the Curtis Theatre; its members 
also present a spring variety show there each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Winter Winds" will feature 16 members of the troupe performing traditional and 
contemporary holiday tunes ranging from "Carol of the Bells" to "Grandma Got 
Run Over by a Reindeer." The finale includes a Christmas medley capped off by a 
30-second song sampler -- snatches of eight popular tunes sung in quick 
succession. 
</P>
<P>
The chance for teen-agers to work together as entertainers and perform for the 
public is "such an important part of the whole growing-up thing," Henson said. 
"It builds relationships. All of these kids come from different economic and 
family backgrounds, but they share a common love of performing." Participation 
in the group is open to any county resident between the ages of 14 and 18. Each 
week during the school year, the students meet with Henson and his three-member 
staff at Placentia High School. Vocal coach Jo Monteleone and Henson help them 
polish their singing skills while Kimberley Hahn, a regular choreographer of 
Disneyland shows and parades, and Dede Madrigal, owner of a private dance 
studio in Fullerton, lead them in movement exercises and dance routines. The 
performers are also offered hands-on industry experience. Each year they cut a 
demonstration tape in a professional recording studio, and they have taped 
cable television specials and a promotional video for the Boy Scouts of 
America's National Exploring Program. 
</P>
<P>
The Young Entertainers pay nothing for their training. Instead, the group 
covers most of its costs through ticket and program sales at its two annual 
concerts, booking fees for private parties and small donations by local 
businesses and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
While many graduates of the group do go on to study the performing arts in 
college or land jobs as entertainers, the program's real lessons go far beyond 
do-re-mi, Henson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all of these kids aspire to be professionals," he noted. "This is a 
terrific forum for social development, in that they have to represent 
themselves in a variety of situations and to a variety of people. It's a real 
confidence-builder."

A 'TONIGHT SHOW' FIRST-TIMER RELATES HIS 6 MINUTES OF FAME 
</P>

When comedian Jack Coen first started doing stand-up comedy full time at 21, 
his ultimate goal was to one day do a guest shot on "The Tonight Show With 
Johnny Carson." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 11 years, he performed in nightclubs and on college campuses 
around the country, honing an act that now deals with topical material, growing 
up, married life, having kids and sports. 
</P>
<P>
During that time he also appeared on "Evening at the Improv" and the usual 
cable comedy shows. 
</P>
<P>
But still no "Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
Then he got the call. 
</P>
<P>
And last July -- on Friday the 13th, no less -- Coen made his stand-up comedy 
debut on the NBC show. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to this point, it's the best moment I have had as a stand-up comedian," 
says Coen, who is appearing at the Improvisation in Irvine through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The comedian, who is polishing a new six-minute set for his second, 
as-yet-unscheduled, "Tonight Show" appearance, said that appearing on the 
granddaddy of late-night talk shows for the first time was a professional 
pinnacle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like I heard somebody once say: It's the Good Housekeeping Seal of 
Approval for comedians. It says, 'You are a comedian,' " said Coen. 
</P>
<P>
So what's it really like to stand behind the curtain of "The Tonight Show" and 
hear the king of talk show hosts announce your name? 
</P>
<P>
The following is an anatomy of Coen's date with comedy destiny: 
</P>
<P>
 The call in July came from "Tonight Show" talent coordinator Jim McCawley, who 
had seen Coen perform at two different comedy clubs in recent months. When the 
offer finally came, Coen had mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"After years of watching the comics on 'The Tonight Show,' " Coen said, "a part 
of me felt, 'I've grown past this. I don't need this anymore.' Because I wasn't 
getting on the show and no one was interested, I decided it wasn't that big a 
deal anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"And then when he told me I had it I cried like a baby." 
</P>
<P>
Coen laughed. "It was like a monkey off my back. When you actually accomplish a 
goal that, when you first set it was more of a dream than a goal, it's really 
emotional." 
</P>
<P>
The call came on a Tuesday, and McCawley asked Coen to do the show that Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard they do that sometimes with your first shot so you don't get crazy 
thinking about it, but it was horrible," said Coen. 
</P>
<P>
It meant that he had only three nights to practice his six-minute "Tonight 
Show" set. 
</P>
<P>
That night, McCawley met Coen at the Improv in Los Angeles to go over the jokes 
he wanted Coen to do on the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I did them that night at the club and it didn't go real well, which was 
frightening," said Coen. "McCawley said he wanted to come see it again the next 
night. But he called me the next morning and said, 'I have confidence in you. 
I'll just see you Friday.' " 
</P>
<P>
That, Coen said, was a relief. And over the next two nights, he did his six 
minutes at four different comedy clubs each night. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Coen arrived at NBC Studios in Burbank at 5 p.m., reporting to a 
dressing room with his name on it. 
</P>
<P>
Along to provide moral support were his wife, Dawn, and his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes before show time at 5:30, Coen's wife and friend went to the "green 
room" to watch the show on a monitor, and Coen went backstage, standing behind 
the wall directly behind Johnny Carson's desk. 
</P>
<P>
Coen immediately began pacing back and forth, trying to relax: "I went through 
moments of being, 'OK, I'm cool, I'm ready' to 'Oh, my God, I can't do this!' " 
</P>
<P>
Comedian Bob Saget, host of "America's Funniest Home Videos," was also a guest 
on the show, and he came up to Coen to wish him luck. "I know what you're going 
through," Saget told him. "It's the greatest and it's the worst. . . . Just 
have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Then the "Tonight Show" theme music started. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard that," Coen said, "My knees buckled." 
</P>
<P>
Coen said there were "a lot of people hanging out" backstage before the show. 
"Johnny Carson was about 2 feet away from me waiting to go on. Then Johnny 
said, 'Well, ready to do a show?' and he turned around and walked out on the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
During a commercial break about 40 minutes into the show, Coen was escorted to 
a spot behind the curtain. 
</P>
<P>
"All of sudden I heard like a low thud," he said. It was the sound of the 
spotlight out front being turned on. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned to Jim McCawley -- he practically holds your hand until the curtain 
goes up -- and I said, 'Can you get me a glass of water?' He bolted and got a 
glass." 
</P>
<P>
Coen said there were "two big guys whose only job is to open that curtain, and 
they didn't say a word to me. They just looked at me like, 'You're crazy to go 
out there.' Every nerve of my body was alive. I was twisting and shaking, 
kicking my legs and rolling my head to relax." 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't know it at the time, his wife and friend had been backstage 
so long that they lost their seats. They were taken onto the stage floor next 
to the camera to watch his act. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me that when that spotlight came on they were so choked up because 
here they were on that floor," said Coen. "They just couldn't believe how 
intense it was. Then they were thinking, 'Oh, my God, he's got to come out and 
tell jokes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Coen was no less intense behind the curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Because the band was playing loudly during the commercial break, Coen said, "I 
screamed at the top of my lungs to get the tension out. The minute I got done 
screaming the band stopped playing." 
</P>
<P>
As Carson was introducing him, Coen swished water around in his mouth and 
handed the glass to McCawley. Then the curtain opened and he stepped out on 
stage, walking to his mark, a small red T on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I got on it and I didn't move," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coen said all his nervousness vanished after his first joke. And his six 
minutes seemed to fly by. 
</P>
<P>
"It was weird because all of a sudden that monitor light came on for Johnny's 
cue to go to a commercial and I thought, 'Oh, now the band is going to start 
playing,"' said Coen. "While that was going on in my head I was listening to 
myself and I thought, 'Oh, my God, I'm on the last joke!' It was absolutely 
perfect" timing. 
</P>
<P>
Coen said he has a lot of friends who are comics who have done the "Tonight 
Show" and the one thing they kept telling him was, "Make sure you have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Two or three minutes into his set, he said, "I just really hit a stride where I 
thought, 'Oh, boy, this is just so great.' " 
</P>
<P>
Coen nevertheless was visibly relieved when he finished. In fact, Coen said, 
Carson said to Saget, "Did you see the sigh of relief?" 
</P>
<P>
"He knows that first shot is pretty nerve-wracking," Coen said, "although I 
can't imagine the second one being any less nerve-wracking." 
</P>
<P>
After the show, Carson came backstage to Coen's dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
"He shook my hand and he was really pleasant," said Coen. "And he gave me a 
joke to go onto one of my other jokes. The whole time I kept looking at him, 
thinking, 'You're Johnny Carson!' " 
</P>
<P>
Coen said he was so awed by Carson that his wife and friend later had to 
reconstruct the joke Carson had given him. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Coen said, the Berlin Wall had crumbled and there was talk of 
cutting back on American troops in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"My joke was, 'Can you imagine what a loser you're going to feel like when you 
get laid off from the Army?' And then Johnny said, to punch it up -- to do a 
tag -- would be to say, 'Oh, man. And I was so close to being all I could be.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Coen's "Tonight Show" odyssey has its own tag ending. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since that night, whenever Coen is introduced, the emcee lists the show 
among the comic's credits. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes me feel good," Coen said. "A lot of famous people have stood on 
that mark, and I got to stand on it too."

HOMELESSLAND: The latest comment on Orange County's culture comes from a new 
play called "Food and Shelter" in San Francisco. . . . In it, a homeless family 
resorts to living overnight in Disneyland. L.A. playwright Jane Anderson says 
the ironic premise of misery in "the Happiest Place on Earth" is to be taken 
seriously. "Disneyland is to American culture what Greek mythology was to the 
Greeks. It's the ultimate utopia." David Reyes and Steve Emmons

NORTH COUNTY CAN WEATHER LONG DROUGHT, OFFICIALS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
RESOURCES: A VAST UNDERGROUND LAKE IS INSURANCE AGAINST THE METROPOLITAN WATER 
DISTRICT'S PLANNED CUTBACK IN DELIVERIES, BUT SOUTH COUNTY COULD BE LEFT 
THIRSTING, ACCORDING TO A SURVEY OF WATER COMPANIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY MARCANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER12/13/90

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northern Orange County's abundant ground-water supply would leave it virtually 
unaffected by a planned cutback in water deliveries, but some South County 
consumers could be left dry if the drought continues, according to a survey of 
water companies Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials said voluntary conservation programs implemented in parts of 
the county over the past year have neared or met the 5% reduction in the 
residential supply, based on last year's consumption levels, that the 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California plans to implement Feb. 1. 
Further conservation and plentiful ground water should make up for any reduced 
MWD flow, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a mandatory rationing plan that we could implement, but I anticipate 
that the voluntary efforts will do it," said Karl Kemp, director of the Mesa 
Consolidated Water District, which serves Costa Mesa and parts of Newport Beach 
and derives 70% of its supply from ground water. "We just need to get the word 
out to more people more often that this is not a drill. This is real." 
</P>
<P>
Highly residential districts, such as Mesa Consolidated, will be able to rely 
for years on ground water from a lake beneath the county that contains millions 
of gallons accumulated from centuries of Santa Ana River runoff. 
</P>
<P>
But South County cities and districts are already suffering from bone-dry 
creeks and wells and can ill-afford a decrease in imported water from MWD, 
which delivers water to 27 Southland agencies that retail it to the public. 
Increased water needs for southern farmlands -- to which MWD plans to cut 
supply by 20% -- and the area's booming population will only compound the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
But even with those factors against them, South County water consumers still 
are not likely to see mandatory rationing soon, water officials there said. So 
far, voluntary cuts in water use have been enough to keep pipelines from drying 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have a voluntary conservation program in effect now, which, if we 
ensured the measures are carried out, can achieve our 5% cutback without any 
drastic actions," said Jack Foley, general manager of the Moulton Niguel Water 
District, which covers parts of Laguna Niguel, Dana Point, Laguna Hills and 
Mission Viejo. Foley added that if the 5% reduction isn't met, an ordinance 
allows the board to enforce it through penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Ranch Water District receives 70% of its supply from MWD and serves 
large tracts of farmland. But a project in which water is recycled for gardens 
and other industrial purposes, and a voluntary conservation program that cut 
water use 6.4% from May to September, means that Irvine will be relatively 
unaffected, said Joyce Gwidt, a spokeswoman for the water district. 
</P>
<P>
"We have really planned for future needs, so we're in a little better place 
that other cities that depend totally on imported water," Gwidt said. "We've 
been actively teaching water conservation in the schools and working with our 
customers (on conservation techniques) for a couple of years now." 
</P>
<P>
Still, water district officials surveyed Wednesday were only cautiously 
optimistic. While they were confident that mandatory rationing and rate hikes 
can be avoided in the short term, nearly all of the cities and water companies 
said they have contingency plans at the ready should the drought continue into 
a fifth year. 
</P>
<P>
In several districts, city councils have passed or are considering ordinances 
that allow for gradual water cutbacks as the drought worsens. Nearly all cities 
in Orange County have passed resolutions calling for voluntary cutbacks of 
varying degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of such conservation programs is one implemented in May in the 
Capistrano Valley Water District, where officials passed a four-stage 
conservation ordinance, Administrative Services Manager Don Metzger said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Stage One, which we are in, it's strictly a voluntary conservation," 
Metzger said. "It does provide the option to go to mandatory as the stages 
progress." The second stage would continue voluntary conservation with some 
mandatory measures, such as a ban on serving water in restaurants without a 
specific request. 
</P>
<P>
"In the third and fourth stages, reductions become mandatory, including 
penalties that can disconnect service until a customer corrects the situation," 
Metzger said. "It means no irrigation during peak periods, no hosing down 
driveways, fixing leaks right away. Now we just ask people to do these things." 
</P>
<P>
More likely than strict conservation in the short term are tiered-rate systems 
that charge customers based on the amount of water they use. Few districts or 
cities have plans for rate hikes, but officials said the tiered system could be 
an effective method of getting consumers to cut water use. 
</P>
<P>
Foley, of the Moulton Niguel district, said consumers there have been under a 
tiered-rate system since 1976, the only current tiered system in the county. 
"It's made up in 30 units, each of 100 cubic feet (of water)," he said. "The 
first 30 units are on a fixed rate, each 10 after that, the rate jumps up." He 
added that the system has proven effective in conserving water. 
</P>
<P>
"High rollers pay an incrementally higher amount," Foley said. "I figure that's 
an incentive to save water."

GOVERNMENT'S TOP LAWYER TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After serving for more than a quarter-century as Orange County government's top 
lawyer, Adrian Kuyper is stepping down and recommending that his chief deputy 
succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
Kuyper, 62, who has worked in the county counsel's office for 34 years, said 
Wednesday that "it might be time to move on." 
</P>
<P>
Known as a conservative and thoughtful lawyer, Kuyper provided guidance to the 
county Board of Supervisors during the most explosive period in Orange County 
history. When he took over as county counsel in 1964, the county was largely 
agricultural and few envisioned the real estate and population boom that would 
transform it into a bustling urban area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been very interesting and exciting over the years," Kuyper said. "We've 
seen a lot of problems and issues as a result of the growth and changing laws." 
</P>
<P>
Kuyper will leave on March 22 and has recommended that the supervisors appoint 
his chief assistant, William J. McCourt, to the post. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, the senior member of the Orange County board, said 
he would miss Kuyper's advice. 
</P>
<P>
"I have respected Adrian for his integrity, his professional excellence and his 
conservatism," Riley said. "The county has certainly received outstanding 
advice from him over the years." 
</P>
<P>
Although Riley said it was too soon to settle on a replacement for Kuyper, he 
added that McCourt has also impressed board members during his 25 years of 
service. JIM NEWTON

COUNCIL OKS $15,000 TO FIX UP BALL FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved spending $15,000 to improve the Duane Winters 
Field at Amerige Park in time for the 1991 men's baseball season at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The men's baseball and soccer teams will use the park as their home field 
during the 1990 through 1992 athletic seasons while the campus Sports Complex 
is constructed, a project that is expected to take 18 to 24 months. 
</P>
<P>
The university will pay only $5,000 of the $20,000 needed to refurbish the 
field. But the city justified bearing the majority of the costs because the 
improvements will benefit the youth groups who will continue to use the field 
after the university teams return to their campus complex. 
</P>
<P>
The upgrades, which are necessary to comply with NCAA regulations, include 
bullpens, a home run fence, batting cages, a public address system and a 
storage unit.

UNITED WAY PLEDGES REACH 67% OF GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pledges for United Way of Orange County have exceeded $15 million with just 
over six weeks remaining in the 1990 fund-raising campaign, officials reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The pledge total represents about 67% of the $22.5-million goal, said United 
Way spokesman Jeff Rocke. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel real good about the pace of the campaign and how it is functioning in 
the current economic environment," Rocke noted. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 goal is a 9% increase over last year's pledge total, a record-setting 
$20.6 million. The 1989 campaign ended four consecutive years in which the 
local agency had failed to meet its fund-raising goal. 
</P>
<P>
Despite last year's success, county-based corporations have traditionally 
contributed far less per capita than those in comparable urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
To help offset the trend, the local agency this year began a new program that 
allows donors unlimited choice in directing where their contributions are 
spent. The donor-choice program allows donors to target their contributions to 
specific agencies or to special issues -- such as homelessness and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Although no figures were available on use of the donor-directed option, United 
Way officials said early indications are that program is proving a big success.

CITY DELAYS DECISION ON CLEARING CANYONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has delayed for three months a decision on a controversial 
Fire Department plan to prune trees and clear dried vegetation and brush in two 
Corona del Mar canyons. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen people showed up for Monday's public hearing, most of whom 
were opposed to the weed abatement project, which could cost each homeowner 
$2,000 to $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Many attending the meeting argued that clearing out the vegetation would 
increase erosion along the sometimes steep hillsides and that the city would be 
liable for any damages resulting from the work. Others complained that by 
getting rid of the natural plants in the area, grasses and weeds that are less 
drought-resistant would grow and the risk of fire would increase. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that Buck Gully could burn, but I think if you take the 
material out of there now and replace it with grasses, you're going to have a 
worse situation," said Ronald Kennedy, a resident of Hazel Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Residents along the two canyons were notified this summer that the Fire 
Department considers houses along Buck Gully and Morning Canyon to be at 
significant risk for fire. 
</P>
<P>
In July, homeowners were asked to remove all dead brush, weeds, grass or trees 
and to prune tree limbs and shrubbery according to Fire Department 
specifications. At that time, a crew of city fire inspectors began visiting 
properties in the affected areas, pointing out violations and providing 
instructions at the request of residents. 
</P>
<P>
As of last weekend, only 33 of the 167 properties along Buck Gully and Morning 
Canyon had complied with the department specifications. Monday night's action 
means that the remaining residents will have at least 90 days to comply, while 
the city staff gathers information about possible soil erosion if the work is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
If the weed abatement is approved by the council, city crews will be brought in 
to clear the property and owners will be charged for the work on their property 
tax bills. LAURA MICHAELIS

PEOPLE: NEW LIFE UNFOLDS FOR TEACHER TURNED ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Because it has given her a sense of tranquility, Barbara Pearl has cleverly 
renamed each of her creations in origami, the Oriental art of paper folding, "a 
Peace of Paper." 
</P>
<P>
Her interest came after a somewhat disillusioning career in teaching 
mathematics to junior high school students in four states, when she sought 
another avenue to happiness. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to give up hope with teaching," the Temple University graduate 
said. "I just changed the format." 
</P>
<P>
Pearl felt classrooms were overcrowded, children didn't want to learn and 
neither parents nor the administration gave teachers much support. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people in the (school) systems working toward revamping different 
areas, but the stress on me was too difficult, and I didn't feel like making 
more sacrifices," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach woman found that origami used many of the same geometric 
principles she used in teaching mathematics to her students. 
</P>
<P>
"Paper folding brings lines, angles, ratios and proportions into play, giving 
it a sense of mathematics," she said, noting she still was teaching 
mathematics, only in a different form. 
</P>
<P>
But what it did for Pearl, who studied under origami masters in New York, was 
to provide her with a new career in a cottage business in which she 
demonstrates origami at birthday and anniversary parties and teaches the art. 
</P>
<P>
"One of these days I plan to make a video on origami for a cable television 
show," said Pearl, who has been folding paper into various figures and designs 
for a decade. "It's a visual art and needs to be demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl has been exhibiting her work each month at libraries in Orange County and 
is booked six months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
"People have asked to buy some of my work, but I don't sell any of my work," 
she said. "They are too precious to me to sell. I prefer others to make their 
own." 
</P>
<P>
Included in her exhibits are figures of horses, snakes, birds and elephants. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl said American interest in origami has grown in the past decade, after the 
founding of the national association of the Friends of the Origami Center of 
America in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based center boasts a membership of 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
"Learning an art form from another culture is beneficial," said Pearl, who 
often gives talks and demonstrations to senior citizens and schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
During those sessions, Pearl points out that paper folding is exciting but at 
the same time "is also very meditative. It gives you a sense of serenity. You 
enjoy the journey as well as the destination." 
</P>
<P>
Although origami has its roots in Asia, Pearl changes the name when she gives 
instruction to adults and children at her local Jewish Temple. 
</P>
<P>
Then she calls it Jewish Paper Folding.

CLOSING ARGUMENTS HEARD IN GIONIS CASE; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: KEY ARGUMENTS CENTER ON THE DOCTOR'S ROLE, IF ANY, IN THE ASSAULT ON 
AISSA WAYNE AND HER FORMER BOYFRIEND. THE JURY COULD GET THE CASE TODAY.

<P>
Lawyers in the trial of Dr. Thomas A. Gionis delivered their closing arguments 
Wednesday, differing sharply about the importance of defense evidence that the 
doctor was with a client at a time when the prosecution contends that he was on 
the phone ordering the assault of his ex-wife, Aissa Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
The three-week trial has been filled with dramatic testimony about the attack 
on Wayne, the 34-year-old daughter of the late actor John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
The closing arguments centered on key details about Gionis' alleged role in the 
attack. "I never told you that the phone records would prove who was on the 
telephone," Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
"But the calls were made to telephones in the doctor's control. And the pattern 
of telephone calls before and after the assault tells you he knows what's going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, 37, an orthopedic surgeon, faces eight felony counts in the Oct. 3, 
1988, assault on Wayne, and her former boyfriend, financier Roger W. Luby, in 
the garage of Luby's Newport Beach estate. Both were beat up by two gunmen and 
Luby's Achilles' tendon was cut with a knife. They were then left tied up. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Gionis and Wayne were embroiled in a bitter custody 
battle over their daughter, who was almost 2 years old at the time. When Wayne 
violated a court order and took the little girl to Arizona on a vacation, 
prosecutors contend, Gionis decided to "teach her a lesson." 
</P>
<P>
The two men who carried out the assault were hired by Dan Gal, a Century City 
private detective hired by Gionis to conduct surveillance on Wayne in 
preparation for a court trial on the custody dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claim that Gionis ordered the assault through Gal. However, the 
defense claims that Gal became upset with Wayne -- for making an obscene 
gesture at him and avoiding him by running off to Arizona with the child -- and 
decided on his own to teach her a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
The key prosecution witness against Gionis was Jeffrey K. Bouey, one of those 
who carried out the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey testified that shortly before the attack, Gal was on his car phone 
talking animatedly while Gal, Bouey and another assailant were spying on Wayne 
at Luby's home. When Gal got off the phone, Bouey quoted him as saying: "That 
was the client. He's upset. He wants it done now because he's got a court date 
coming up soon." 
</P>
<P>
Phone company records show three calls from Gal's car phone at that time -- two 
to Gionis' limousine and a third to Gionis' house in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
But the defense presented considerable evidence, unchallenged by prosecutors, 
that Gionis was neither in his limousine nor at his Pomona home when any of 
those calls came in from Gal. He was in his office in Upland, treating a 
patient for back surgery, the patient and his wife both testified. 
</P>
<P>
John D. Barnett, Gionis' attorney, told jurors Wednesday that the doctor's 
uncontested alibi for the time of those phone calls shows that Bouey or Gal, or 
both, are liars. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Gionis is in the clear," Barnett told the jurors. "There isn't a question 
that he is innocent." Later he added: "This isn't hard, folks. The prosecution 
doesn't have a case. This is simple stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Evans countered that Bouey's statement about the phone call is not 
diminished by the doctor's alibi because other telephone records show a flurry 
of calls that day between phones owned by Gal and Gionis. Many of those calls 
were coming to Gal from Gionis' limousine, which prosecutor Evans indicated 
could have been made on the doctor's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Evans pointed to other evidence: 
</P>
<P>
* Finance records show a dramatic increase in payments from Gionis to Gal 
immediately before the time Bouey claims that he and his best friend, Jerrel 
Hintergardt, agreed to carry out the assault. 
</P>
<P>
* Bouey testified that Gal drew a floor plan of the interior of Wayne's home, 
even showing where he and Hintergardt could get into the house through louvered 
doors. Because Gal had never been inside the Wayne home, that floor plan had to 
come from Gionis, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Barnett contends that the floor plan was only to help Gal in 
conducting surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Gionis is a doctor. He's not a private investigator," Barnett told the 
jurors. "If this is what Gal tells him he needs, then he gives it to him. He 
doesn't know." 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Evans countered: "You don't need a floor plan to conduct 
surveillance from outside the house. You don't need to know where the weakest 
point of entry is." 
</P>
<P>
* Evans contended the key to the case is Gionis' motive. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a bitter, bitter custody fight," Evans said. "She runs off to Sedona 
(Arizona) with the daughter. And what does Gionis do? He runs down to the 
Newport Beach Police Department and files a crime report on her. He wants to 
put Momma in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Gal, on the other hand, had no motive for hurting Wayne on his own because 
"he's making a good living by sitting out in front of her house conducting 
surveillance on her," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to cut off the goose that lays the golden egg? No way," the 
prosecutor told the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
But Barnett offered evidence during the defense portion of the case that Gal 
sees himself as a James Bond figure who once admitted to a police officer that 
he forged a $4,000 check in a case that was ultimately dismissed. Then, Gal 
later denied any wrongdoing in an application for a private investigator's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan Gal is a thief, a liar, and a perjurer," Barnett said. "He's a little 
off-center. When you see that, you do have a knothead, just the kind of crazy 
guy who would conduct the daylight attack in the way this was done." 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt, who admitted slashing Luby's ankle, is serving an eight-year 
sentence after being convicted of the assault at a separate trial. Bouey is 
awaiting trial but is expected to be allowed to plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Gal, also awaiting trial, has cooperated with authorities and admitted his 
role. But Evans did not use him as a witness at either the Hintergardt or 
Gionis trials. Prosecutors did not want to plea-bargain with him because of his 
key role in the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Theodore E. Millard is scheduled to instruct the jurors 
today. They are expected to deliberate the rest of the day, and then not return 
until Monday if no verdict is reached.

U.S. CITIZEN CHARGED IN MAY KILLING OF IMMIGRANT BOY; 
</P>
<P>
BORDER VIOLENCE: THE RANDOM SHOOTING WAS ONE OF THOSE RECENTLY DEPLORED AT A 
MEETING OF U.S. AND MEXICAN PRESIDENTS. THE 12-YEAR-OLD WAS EN ROUTE FROM 
MEXICO TO HIS PARENTS' APARTMENT IN STANTON.

Authorities arrested a laborer Wednesday and charged him with firing the shot 
that killed a 12-year-old Mexican boy who was gunned down almost seven months 
ago as he and family members walked along a border hillside en route to his 
parents' home in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Emilio Jimenez Bejines is one of a number of border-area homicides 
this year that led the presidents of both Mexico and the United States to 
condemn the growing violence during a meeting in Monterrey, Mexico, last month. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with first-degree murder in the shooting is Dwight Ray Pannel, a 
23-year-old U.S. citizen who lives in Imperial Beach and works occasional 
construction jobs. Pannel was arrested at his home and was being held in lieu 
of $1 million bail. He was also charged in several robberies and an assault 
case involving undocumented immigrants who were victimized earlier on the day 
of the murder for "beer money," according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before firing the fatal shot, according to a witness quoted in court 
papers, Pannel said, "Let's shoot some aliens." He then fired a .30-caliber 
hunting rifle toward a hillside where many undocumented immigrants had 
gathered, the witness told investigators. Pannel fired from the rear balcony of 
the home of a friend who lives about half a mile north of the international 
boundary, in an area regularly traversed by migrants headed north. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Aragon, the San Diego deputy district attorney who is prosecuting the 
case, refrained from calling the shooting a racially linked "hate crime." The 
suspect has no known link to organized hate groups, Aragon said. 
</P>
<P>
Emilio was shot about 3:30 p.m. May 18. He died of a single .30-caliber gunshot 
wound about 1 1/2 hours after he, two siblings and an uncle had crossed the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
The dead boy's father, who lives in a Stanton apartment house, is a legal U.S. 
resident via the amnesty program, but the three youths and the boy's mother are 
undocumented, according to family members. 
</P>
<P>
"We've suffered enough from this," the boy's father, Ernesto Jimenez, said 
Wednesday. "All we want is justice." 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Loaeza, the Mexican consul general in San Diego, said the Mexican 
government was "very satisfied" that the long-pending inquiry finally appeared 
to be moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Pannel represent a major turnaround in the investigation, 
the result, prosecutors say, of lengthy questioning of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, investigators say, they were convinced that the fatal bullet was 
fired from the rear balcony of the border-area family home of Leonard Paul 
Cuen, 21, who was initially arrested as a suspect in the case but was released 
10 days later. Ballistics tests have positively identified Cuen's .30-caliber 
hunting rifle as the murder weapon, authorities say. Police had said Cuen fired 
during a day of beer-drinking and target shooting with friends. 
</P>
<P>
However, an affidavit now on file in Superior Court shows that at least three 
men, including Cuen, fired shots from the balcony on the afternoon of the 
murder. There is a direct line of fire from the balcony to the site where the 
boy was felled, about 430 yards to the south, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors now say Cuen was inside the house taking a shower when the fatal 
shot was fired. Pannel was on the balcony, and, according to the affidavit, two 
witnesses who were also on the balcony saw Pannel fire the rifle into the hills 
about the time of the boy's death.

GUARD WHO PLAYS IN PAIN HAS BEEN HEALING FORCE FOR TITANS

<P>
When doctors told Michelle Hennessey in 1988 that the only way she could play 
basketball pain-free was to have her two small toes amputated, she wouldn't 
even consider such an extreme measure. 
</P>
<P>
But after three surgeries -- each failing to remedy her foot problems -- two 
seasons played in excruciating pain and the daily burden of perpetually purple, 
swollen toes, the radical has evolved into the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Lose the toes, lose the pain. 
</P>
<P>
Hennessey, the former Edison High School standout who is now Cal State 
Fullerton's point guard, doesn't relish the thought of having two toes removed. 
But if it means playing basketball, tennis, going water- and snow-skiing 
without pain, she says it will be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't think this way 2 1/2 years ago, when she left the University of Utah 
after her freshman season, returning home and vowing never to play basketball 
again. 
</P>
<P>
But she does now. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to do it at first, but this could affect me the rest of my 
life," said Hennessey, a 5-foot-2 junior who hopes to have the operation after 
the season. "I love to play a lot of sports and this would allow me to do those 
without pain." 
</P>
<P>
Hennessey's foot problems began in her senior year at Edison (1986-87). Her 
sneakers didn't seem to fit right and she developed an infection that ran from 
her toes to her shins. 
</P>
<P>
Hennessey went to a hospital emergency room for treatment and doctors later 
discovered that two bones in her fourth and fifth toes were rubbing together. 
She underwent surgery after the season to remove bone fragments from the small 
toes. 
</P>
<P>
A four-year starter and an all-Orange County performer at Edison, Hennessey 
accepted a scholarship to Utah, where she earned a starting spot in the fifth 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
She averaged four points, six assists and two painfully swollen feet a game, 
but Hennessey cringed when a doctor in Utah suggested the amputations. 
</P>
<P>
She decided to give up basketball before body parts, returning home for another 
operation to remove bone fragments and enrolling at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Hennessey spent the 1988-89 season coaching Edison's junior varsity team, but 
it pained her as much to sit out as it did to play. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by a third operation, in which all the bones from her small toes 
were removed and the fourth and fifth toes on each foot were sewn together, 
Hennessey returned to action. She averaged 8.6 points and 6.8 assists a game to 
help Orange Coast to a 26-6 last season, and is now piling up assists at 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
But despite a relentless, full speed ahead, on-court demeanor that doesn't give 
a hint of injury, Hennessey's feet are killing her. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think about it as much when I'm in the game, but I still have a lot of 
pain," she said. "There's nothing anyone can do to make it better. I've tried 
all the gadgets -- putting things between my toes, putting padding or foam in 
the shoes -- nothing works. I want to have the operation and will if I can talk 
my mother into it." 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the catch. 
</P>
<P>
"When I think of an amputated finger or toe it makes me shudder, and here she's 
choosing it," said Paulette Hennessey, Michelle's mother. "She has 10 toes -- I 
counted every one of them when she was born -- and I want her to have them 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Paulette has tried to appeal to her daughter's vanity. 
</P>
<P>
"She's worried about what my feet would look like in sandals," Michelle said. 
"She thinks it's a little extreme and maybe she's right, but who cares if I can 
do anything I want later in life? It would be worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Michelle understands her mother's position, and Paulette is beginning to 
empathize with her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"If she wants it, I guess there's not much I can do," Paulette said. "I think 
by the end of the season, if she's in as much pain as she is now, she'll have 
it done." 
</P>
<P>
Even with her sore feet, Hennessey has been a cure-all for an ailing Titan 
team. In Hennessey, Fullerton Coach Maryalyce Jeremiah has a true point guard, 
one who can handle the ball, pass well, lead the fast break and play tenacious 
defense -- all missing ingredients on last year's 14-14 team. 
</P>
<P>
Hennessey has a team-leading 44 assists (7.3 average), 19 steals and only 19 
turnovers for the 4-2 Titans, who play host to the University of San Diego 
Saturday night. She set school single-game assist (13) and steal (eight) 
records in the season opener against Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"She's making a big difference in the program this year," Jeremiah said. "She's 
one of the hardest-playing kids I've ever had. She just wastes herself every 
game. The way she plays, you wouldn't even know there's anything wrong with 
her." 
</P>
<P>
By this time next year, Hennessey hopes there isn't anything wrong with her, 
unless you consider an athlete with no small toes abnormal. Hennessey is 
willing to accept that. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is worried about how it will affect my balance, but the doctor said 
you don't need your little toes for balance," Hennessey said. "I want to have 
the surgery for a lot of reasons. I want to get through a game without my toes 
swelling up and turning colors."

CHRIST COLLEGE COMES DOWN FROM HILL, RISES TO NEW HEIGHTS

Each time it wins a game this season, the Christ College Irvine women's 
basketball team takes another step away from its dismal past. The Eagles, who 
won only four of 27 games last year, are 6-1 this season, and Tuesday they 
shocked Biola, 78-59. 
</P>
<P>
Christ College had never defeated Biola in women's basketball. Last season, 
Biola beat Christ College by 52 points and advanced to the NAIA District 3 
championship game. Tuesday, four starters from that team played for Biola, the 
only California team to receive mention in the latest national NAIA poll, but 
Christ College still won handily. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt good to come away with a win," said Genevieve Graff, a sophomore guard 
who was a starter last year. "Each game we play builds up our confidence more." 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Kent Schlichtemeier: "I don't think we are going to surprise anyone 
anymore. The NAIA (District 3) stats came out yesterday and we're around the 
top. That's definitely a total reversal from where we were last year." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of last season, the players who would be returning this year met 
with the coaching staff on top of a hill behind the college's campus. They 
talked about self-motivation and commitment and working hard in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a long year last year and we just didn't want that to happen again," 
Schlichtemeier said. "I've never seen a team work harder than this team. 
</P>
<P>
"Our team goal is to make the playoffs this year. It's never been done in the 
school's history." 
</P>
<P>
History at Christ College, founded in 1976, doesn't go back too far. In its 
seventh season of women's basketball, the school has never had a winning 
record. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles, who have lost only to Division II Cal State Dominguez Hills, are 
within one victory of the school record of seven, accomplished in 1987-88 and 
1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
This year Christ College, which plays Whittier College Friday night, is getting 
balanced scoring from Gitte Mejer, a freshman from Denmark, who is the 
district's fourth-leading scorer (14.7); Stacy Kirch, a sophomore transfer from 
Wyoming who is leading the district in three-point shooting percentage (56%), 
and Graff, a sophomore who is averaging 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the nice thing. We have a lot of good scorers from every position so 
they're difficult to defend," Schlichtemeier said. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-county traffic: Because a number of Whittier College players have final 
exams that end at 5:30 p.m. Friday, the Poets' game at Christ College has been 
delayed an hour until 8:30. And even with the delay in game time, the team may 
find it difficult to make the freeway trek from Los Angeles County in time for 
the scheduled start. 
</P>
<P>
Going into a trip to Northern California this weekend, the Chapman women's 
basketball team is doing well statistically. The team's top three players -- 
Marvette Williams (17 points a game), Linda Kirby (17) and Jackie Saunders (15) 
-- are the top three scorers in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. Only 
UC Riverside, which is averaging more than 85 points, is scoring more than the 
Panthers (76.4 a game). 
</P>
<P>
However, only one team, Cal State Los Angeles, is allowing more points than the 
Panthers (67.6). 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to hold people to less points," Coach Lindsay Strothers said, "but I 
guess if we can hold teams to less points than we have we're all right." 
</P>
<P>
But Chapman (6-3) has been inconsistent and Strothers said the Panthers aren't 
playing as a team. 
</P>
<P>
"Player-for-player I don't know if a lot of teams can match up with us," he 
said. "But putting it all together on the floor is a different story, and 
that's my job." 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California College men's basketball team, which has won five 
consecutive games, including a 67-64 overtime victory over Cal State Dominguez 
Hills Saturday, will likely have its first tough test in District 3 on Saturday 
at home against Biola. The game is at 7:30 in SCC's gym, called "The Pit." 
Biola (8-1) was ranked 24th in the latest NAIA poll.

FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES REMEMBER TIM RANDALL; 
</P>
<P>
EULOGY: OFFICIAL WHO DIED AFTER WORKING A HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL GAME HAD 
PASSION FOR REFEREEING.

<P>
High school basketball referee Frederick (Tim) Randall, who died Tuesday after 
his heart failed while working a game, was remembered Wednesday by friends and 
associates as a family man, an accomplished referee and a friend to the 
athletes and coaches he worked with for nearly two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Randall, an Anaheim resident, died at St. Jude's Hospital after collapsing 
during a freshman girls' game at Troy High School in Fullerton. He was 67. 
Funeral services are pending. 
</P>
<P>
Although he worked as a referee and softball umpire for many years, Randall 
touched the lives of hundreds of youngsters in physical education classes and 
on athletic teams at Los Alamitos High School, where he was equipment manager 
until his retirement in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Randall also became close to several members of the Rams' organization as the 
referee for the team's charity basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
"Most players knew his family pretty well," said Todd Hewitt, the Rams' 
assistant equipment manager and Los Alamitos High graduate, who arranged in 
1978 for Randall to referee Ram basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
The games are modeled after Harlem Globetrotter games, often featuring hi-jinks 
more than athletic prowess, and are held to raise money for school athletic 
programs and other charities. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd put on some skits . . . We threw water on him," recalled Hewitt, who as a 
10th-grader met Randall in 1972. "He was able to be the center stage a little 
bit. I think there was a little ham or actor in Tim. I think he should have 
been on stage." 
</P>
<P>
But Randall was more than a comic on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very good ref," Hewitt said. "Even in our games he was a very good 
ref. He'd take care of the flow of the game and keep it running. He'd keep the 
game at a low level . . . and nothing got out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
Hewitt recalled from his high school days that Randall "was kind of like a 
father figure. If you had a trouble you could go in and talk to him." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos High Athletic Director Frank Doretti recalled that Randall joined 
the school staff in 1970 as custodian, but became equipment manager three years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a person that people knew," Doretti said. "He wasn't loud. He was 
really like a father to a lot of the kids . . . If they had a problem with the 
coach, he could sort of mediate. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids cared for him deeply. Each year there would be gobs of them who would 
come back and help with the football games." 
</P>
<P>
Randall returned the affection. 
</P>
<P>
"He was real close to the kids," recalled Al Gragnano, who coaches girls' 
basketball at Los Alamitos High. "He could be stern with them if he had to be. 
But you could tell one of the reasons he did this job was because he cared 
about kids." 
</P>
<P>
Randall also helped fledgling coaches such as Gragnano. 
</P>
<P>
"He was like a father away from home for a young coach and I was a very young 
coach," recalled Gragnano, who became Los Alamitos' varsity baseball coach at 
age 23. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Gragnano refereed youth league games with Randall. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed happiest doing that . . . refereeing was his passion," Gragnano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Randall attended Washington State University and worked as a driver delivering 
bread before going to work for Los Alamitos, Doretti said. Randall's wife, 
Vicki, works as an aide at Hope School for trainable mentally retarded children 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Randall is also survived by daughters Robin and Laura. 
</P>
<P>
"They all have been very close," Doretti said of the Randall family. "He lost 
his son by a previous marriage . . . in Vietnam. With that happening, I think 
it made their family even closer. 
</P>
<P>
"A real big factor with him was his family and his girls. He made sure they 
were out of college off into their own endeavors before he would even consider 
retiring."

CBS TO SPEND $2 BILLION, BUY BACK 44% OF ITS STOCK; 
</P>
<P>
WITH $3 BILLION IN ITS PIGGY BANK, THE COMPANY HAD ALSO BEEN MULLING POSSIBLE 
ACQUISITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
CBS Inc., sending a strong signal that it does not plan to diversify beyond its 
core business of broadcasting, said Wednesday that it will spend $2 billion to 
buy about 44% of the company's own stock from shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The move was widely seen to reflect CBS Inc. Chief Executive Laurence A. 
Tisch's disenchantment with the high prices being paid for such assets as movie 
studios, cable networks or other emerging segments of the entertainment and 
media business. 
</P>
<P>
CBS has been sitting on a cash hoard of $3 billion that it accumulated three 
years ago when Tisch ordered the sale of the company's record and magazine 
divisions. Investors wanted Tisch to make a big acquisition or begin disbursing 
the proceeds to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it would buy back up to 10.5 million of the company's 23.7 
million outstanding shares at $190 per share. The stock recently has traded in 
the $165 to $170 per share range. Earnings per share would be reduced because 
of the loss of interest income from the cash reserves, despite there being a 
smaller number of shares outstanding after the buyback, the network said. 
</P>
<P>
Although traders bid up CBS stock on the news -- the shares closed at $175.50, 
up $5.625 -- Standard &amp; Poor's put the company's $790 million in debt on 
its Creditwatch list "with negative implications." S&amp;P noted that the cash 
reserves have been a "cushion" and "represented an important support" in the 
firm's ratings of CBS debt. 
</P>
<P>
The stock buyback was prompted in part by the Oct. 26 death of CBS' chairman 
and patriarch, William S. Paley, who controlled 8% of CBS Inc.'s stock. 
Trustees of the Paley estate had been negotiating with CBS to sell back to the 
company a portion of the estate's shares to pay tax obligations. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the CBS board elected Tisch chairman, giving him the title that 
had been held by only two people in the company's 62-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch, in a prepared statement, said the offer gives shareholders a "premium 
over recent market prices" but still allows a "substantial equity investment" 
in CBS stock. The tender offer will begin in the next several days and expire 
Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with senior CBS executives in New York, Tisch repeated that he had 
no plans to sell the network, a popularly held assumption among many outsiders. 
He also said that a merger would not be attractive because of accounting rules. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Loews Corp., which is controlled by Tisch and his brother, 
Preston Robert Tisch, owns 24.8% of CBS Inc. stock. The Tisch family is 
estimated to have paid an average of $127 for each of the 5.8 million CBS 
shares held by Loews. 
</P>
<P>
Both Loews Corp. and the Paley estate would tender their shares, CBS said, but 
only a prorated portion would be acquired, leaving their stakes in the company 
essentially unchanged. Tisch has stated that he would not boost his stake above 
25%. 
</P>
<P>
One danger for Tisch in moving above 25% is that it might trigger a "change in 
control" rule of the Federal Communications Commission, which would mean CBS 
would have to sell certain radio or TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
Using the network's huge cash reserves to buy back the stock runs counter to 
previous statements made by Tisch, who had always professed that he wasn't 
anxious to spend the cash. When pressed about what he would do with the money, 
Tisch would answer that it "doesn't burn a hole in my pocket" adding that it 
"earns money every day." 
</P>
<P>
According to executives at CBS, the network had been looking for ways to invest 
its $3-billion cash reserves and considered several major acquisitions in 
addition to a stock repurchase plan. But Tisch's refusal to pay premium prices, 
and his view that such prices are unjustifiable in the current economy, led him 
to conclude that CBS' own hammered stock was the best investment, the 
executives said. 
</P>
<P>
CBS will still have about $800 million in cash after the tender offer is 
completed, which company executives said would be enough to fund current 
operations and buy TV stations, prices for which are beginning to weaken. 
</P>
<P>
"The immutable conclusion is that it doesn't look like CBS is going to be a 
major buyer of assets any time soon," said John Reidy, a media analyst with 
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Reidy and other analysts dismissed speculation that CBS planned to repurchase 
stock to deflect an unwanted takeover attempt. They also downplayed the theory 
that Tisch was actually peddling the company and had set $190 as a "floor" 
below which no offers would be considered. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch "is a very direct individual, and if he wanted to sell the company, he 
wouldn't do it in such an obscure way," said Solomon Bros. analyst Edward 
Atorino. 
</P>
<P>
Not all analysts, however, were convinced the issue was that straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's not a great deal of conviction yet as what the real agenda 
here is yet," said Jeffrey Logsden, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities in 
Los Angeles. "It's unclear whether he's just using the cash (to buy stock), 
smoking out a buyer or fending off a tender offer." 
</P>
<P>
CBS repeatedly has been rumored to be a takeover target for Walt Disney Co. 
Although there is reason to suspect conversations have taken place -- the Tisch 
family has long been friends with Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner's family -- 
people close to Tisch maintain that he sees no advantage in combining with a 
Hollywood studio. 
</P>
<P>
A stock buyback is the latest step in shrinking of CBS since Tisch took control 
of the network in 1986. During the past decade, CBS has been pared down from a 
media and entertainment conglomerate with interests in toys and musical 
instruments to a struggling network with a handful of TV and radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
A stock buyback comes just as the third-place network has been reeling from a 
series of strategic miscalculations. In a gamble to "buy" ratings, CBS has 
committed $3.6 billion for the TV rights to such high-profile sports events as 
football, baseball and the Winter Olympics. But lower-than-expected ratings, 
coupled with short league playoffs and World Series, has contributed to CBS 
incurring nearly a $100-million pretax loss in the first year of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Revealing that the problems were even more serious than previously disclosed, 
CBS also said Wednesday that it would take a $115-million writeoff in the 
fourth quarter from losses steming from its four-year, $1.06-billion Major 
League Baseball contract. 
</P>
<P>
CBS further revealed that its losses from baseball earlier this season totaled 
$55 million. Last month, the network said it would lose money in the fourth 
quarter, even after generous interest income from its cash investments, due to 
lower advertising revenues at the network and stations, baseball losses, and 
increased news costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOEWS' INVESTMENT IN CBS 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Loews Corp. over a period of several months acquired about 5.8 million 
shares of CBS Inc. stock for an estimated average price of $127 per share. 
Loews' total investment thus came to about $744 million for a 24.8% stake in 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
CBS has paid annual dividends of $3 per share in 1987, $3.35 in 1988, and $4.40 
in 1989 and 1990. Based on Loews' 5.8 million shares, the company has received 
about $89 million in dividend payments. 
</P>
<P>
If the tender offer announced Wednesday is fully subscribed, Loews will sell 
about 2.6 million shares back to CBS for $190 per share, or a total of $495 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Loews' initial investment: $744 million 
</P>
<P>
less dividends: -$89 million 
</P>
<P>
less payment for tendered shares: -$495 million 
</P>
<P>
Current net investment: $160 million

Digital May Announce Layoffs: Digital Equipment Corp., the nation's 
second-largest computer maker, said it may resort to its first-ever layoffs in 
early 1991 as part of its $1-billion cost-cutting program. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,200 employees accepted voluntary severance packages in the 1990 
fiscal year. The company has said it wants to reduce its staff by another 5,000 
to 6,000 by the fiscal year ended June, 1991, to cut $1 billion in costs. The 
company said it expects that a considerable number of workers will leave in 
December -- possibly 1,000 or more. It has about 124,000 workers.

U.S., Coopers &amp; Lybrand Settle S&amp;L Case: The "Big Six" accounting firm 
and federal regulators settled charges that the firm understated the amount of 
loan losses by Silverado Banking Savings &amp; Loan Assn., a Denver thrift that 
later collapsed. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the only accounting firm to be charged 
by the Office of Thrift Supervision, agreed to meet several requirements in its 
auditing procedures and accepted an order against further violations, the 
agency said. The firm neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing.

Whittaker Corp.: The Los Angeles-based aerospace and biotechnology concern 
posted fourth-quarter net income of $6 million and fiscal-year income of $86.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Net income was off 38% for the quarter but up 170% for the year. Revenue for 
the quarter was $48.8 million, off 9% over the same quarter of 1989; for the 
year, revenue was $188.5 million, about the same as last year. The company said 
sharply declining interest expense shows that its recent recapitalization was a

PEOPLE: LYONS NAMED CEO AFTER STEERING ASHTON-TATE REVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
William P. Lyons, who has directed Ashton-Tate's thus-far successful turnaround 
efforts, was rewarded for his achievements Wednesday with a promotion to chief 
executive and a seat on the Torrance-based software publisher's board. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons, 46, who has been president and chief operating officer since April, will 
remain president. 
</P>
<P>
Carmelo J. Santoro, chairman and chief executive of Silicon Systems Inc. in 
Santa Ana, continues as chairman of Ashton-Tate's board. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said that although the new title would not bring additional 
responsibilities because Lyons has already been directing the company's daily 
activities, the promotion was designed to reward Lyons for his achievements: 
the release of a new and well-received version of Ashton-Tate's primary 
software program, dBase, and its first quarterly profit in nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
After the release in October, 1988, of an error-riddled version of dBase, a 
database management program that accounts for more than 60% of the company's 
revenues, Ashton-Tate suffered through a series of blunders and problems that 
led to total losses of more than $50 million from early 1989 through 1990. 
Lyons, who joined the company in late 1988 after a 19-year stint with 
International Business Machines, took over operating responsibility of the 
company in April, 1990, from former Chairman, President and Chief Executive 
Edward M. Esber, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"The board has elected Bill Lyons as CEO in recognition of the significant 
accomplishments he has made during his tenure as president. He has returned the 
company to profitability, been instrumental in delivering a stable and reliable 
dBase IV 1.1, and renewed the company's focus on customer service," Santoro 
said. CARLA LAZZARESCHI

AT&amp;T, MCI SETTLE SUITS INVOLVING THEFT OF CUSTOMERS; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNICATIONS: THE FIRMS ACCUSED EACH OTHER OF SWITCHING CONSUMERS WITHOUT 
THEIR CONSENT. BOTH NOW WANT THE FCC TO SET CONDUCT STANDARDS. 
</P>

Attempting to end a bitter and expensive industry practice, American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph and MCI Communications on Wednesday announced that they settled 
a series of lawsuits over alleged theft of long-distance customers and false 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the out-of-court settlement -- covering an industry practice called 
"slamming" under which one firm's telemarketers would try to steal other firms' 
customers -- were not disclosed as a condition of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
However, both sides said that as a part of the settlement they had agreed to 
propose to the Federal Communications Commission a set of industry standards of 
conduct designed to protect consumers from being switched to other 
long-distance companies without their knowledge or consent. 
</P>
<P>
This practice of slamming, a term whose derivation remains a mystery, reached 
epidemic proportions this year as the big three international carriers, 
AT&amp;T, MCI and US Sprint, began feeling the pinch of slowing long-distance 
growth and fought to bolster their revenues by stealing each other's customers. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the suits alleged, telemarketers preyed on the elderly, infirm and 
others with language disabilities. Last year alone, slamming complaints from 
customers exceeded 100,000, and industry sources said the figures for this year 
would be even higher. 
</P>
<P>
As the customers are shifting among the carriers, the companies have started a 
simultaneous -- and expensive -- advertising battle in an attempt to counteract 
the effects of the telemarketing. By some accounts the top three carriers are 
spending a total of more than $2 million per day on their ad campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, the growth of long-distance telephone usage -- once 
thought to be virtually immune from the ravages of recession -- has tapered off 
from a torrid 12% annual growth rate in the late 1980s to about 7% this year. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed telemarketing standards endorsed by AT&amp;T and MCI would permit 
long-distance carriers to switch a customer's service only by one of the 
following means: 
</P>
<P>
* A customer-initiated call to an 800 number of the carrier to which the 
customer is switching. 
</P>
<P>
* Independent third-party confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
* Signed letter of authorization. 
</P>
<P>
* A call placed by the customer to their local or long-distance telephone 
company. 
</P>
<P>
US Sprint officials said Wednesday that they have proposed a similar set of 
guidelines to the FCC and have tightened their own telemarketing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
MCI had sued AT&amp;T in federal court in Washington on Oct. 10, 1989, alleging 
false and deceptive advertising practices. AT&amp;T countersued on Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 10 this year, AT&amp;T sued MCI and its telemarketing agent, alleging 
false and deceptive telemarketing practices. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides denied any wrongdoing and no dollar amounts were specified in the 
suits.

Struggling with a string of losses, Data General Corp. announced that two of 
the computer company's founders will take early retirement, including 
52-year-old Chairman Edson D. de Castro. 
</P>
<P>
De Castro will retire Dec. 31, and Vice Chairman Herbert J. Richman, 56, will 
leave the company at the end of its fiscal year in September. 
</P>
<P>
A statement from the firm gave no reasons for the retirements of the 
executives, who helped found Data General in 1968. De Castro was not available

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: PRODUCTS THAT MAKE GOOD GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Need a last-minute Christmas gift or a New Year's present for yourself? Here 
are some of my favorites: 
</P>
<P>
The first is ideal for anyone who must sit through long meetings while 
colleagues drone on. Sound familiar? If so, your organization is wasting time 
and money. 
</P>
<P>
To find out how much, turn on the Meeting Meter, a $29.95 program that's like a 
taxi meter for meetings. The program allows you to enter the names and hourly 
costs for up to 80 participants. You can also enter the cost of the meeting 
room and other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The display, which looks like a taxi meter, keeps a running total of the 
meeting's actual cost. It might make the perfect gift for your boss or for a 
colleague in need of a not-so-subtle hint. It was created by Bernard DeKoven, 
whose Institute for Better Meetings helps companies use technology to enhance 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
The IBM PC version is memory-resident, so it can be displayed even when other 
programs are running. The Macintosh version runs under Apple's HyperCard 
programming environment. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting Meter can be ordered from the Institute for Better Meetings in Palo 
Alto. Phone: (800) 729-1757 or (415) 857-1757. Fax: (415) 493-1417. 
</P>
<P>
My second choice -- actually two choices -- will help you maintain your 
schedule and keep track of your friends and business associates. And you don't 
need a computer to use it. 
</P>
<P>
The choices are two new versions of Sharp's Wizard handheld electronic 
organizer. I disliked the original Sharp Wizard because its keyboard, laid out 
in an "ABCD" fashion, was almost impossible for me to use. A lot of people 
complained and Sharp listened. The new models have the traditional "QWERTY" 
keyboards that are a lot easier to use if you know your way around a computer 
or typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
The new models still fit in a coat pocket but are a bit larger than their 
predecessor. Both weigh 10.2 ounces and measure 7.1 by 3.8 by 0.7 inches. In 
addition to being larger, the keyboard is now horizontally positioned so that 
you actually have some room to press keys. It's by no means a full-sized 
keyboard, but at least you can find your way around. 
</P>
<P>
The two new models are identical except for their memory capacity and price. 
The Wizard OZ 8200 has a suggested retail price of $399.95 and comes with 128 
kilobytes of memory -- enough to store nearly 2,600 names and phone numbers or 
more than 1,800 appointments. The other model, OZ 8000, has 64 kilobytes of 
memory and costs $359.95. The built-in functions of both models include a 
monthly, weekly and daily calendar, along with a memo pad, address and phone 
directory, business card directory, outliner and calculator. 
</P>
<P>
The Wizard is not classified as a computer, but that's a matter of semantics. 
It is programmable and can run optional software from Sharp and other 
companies. It doesn't have a tiny little disk drive, but it does have a slot 
for credit-card-size integrated circuit cards. Optional cards from Sharp 
include a money planner, a scientific card, a language translator, a time and 
expense card, a Spanish/English card and a spreadsheet. Card prices range from 
$79.99 to $129.99. 
</P>
<P>
The Wizard comes with built-in communications software so that it can be used 
with a modem to access electronic on-line services such as CompuServe and MCI 
Mail. Sharp also plans to introduce a modem and integrated circuit card for 
outgoing faxes. The company also is developing game cards, including Box 
Jockey, Tetris and chess. Also, you can opt for a golf scoring card or a Bible 
on a card. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp offers software to link the Wizard to a PC or Macintosh but will soon 
introduce a new linking program for MS-DOS, with enhanced searching, printing 
and indexing capabilities. It also has a converter for Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet 
files and calendar and address data from Sidekick 2.0, the yet-to-be-released 
new version of Borland International's popular personal information management 
software. 
</P>
<P>
For more information or the name of a dealer, call Sharp at (800) 321-8877. 
</P>
<P>
My third choice will come in handy for anyone who needs to upgrade or maintain 
a PC. "The PC Configuration Handbook: A Complete Guide to Troubleshooting, 
Enhancing and Maintaining Your PC" by John Woram answers questions that are 
almost never covered in basic manuals. Its 700 pages are full of technical 
data, but the book is surprisingly easy to understand, even for the beginner. 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't make it required reading for every new PC user, but I recommend it 
to those who want to get under the hood of their PC. The just-revised second 
edition (Bantam Computer Books, $26.95) covers every type of PC -- through 
those using Intel's 486 microprocessor -- and each version of MS-DOS, including 
5.0. 
</P>
<P>
One additional gift idea that doesn't have any bugs -- but might cause 
cavities: The Original Chocolate Byte and the Original Chocolate Computer, 
starting at $10.95, are compatible with anyone who has a sweet tooth and a 
sense of humor. Call (800) 332-BYTE. 
</P>
<P>
Happy holidays.

LAVENTHOL OFFICE MAY JOIN WITH BDO SEIDMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The local office of foundering accounting giant Laventhol &amp; Horwath is 
negotiating to reopen as a second Orange County branch of BDO Seidman, an 
official from that accounting firm confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, four of the partners in the office had said they would maintain an 
independent office -- Carpe, Wachs, Kipper &amp; Davis -- after Laventhol &amp; 
Horwath fired most of its 3,400 employees in November and announced that it 
would dissolve and file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy code. 
</P>
<P>
But plans to keep the local office going as an independent were squelched after 
some clients said they would change accountants because they wanted their 
audits certified by a big-name firm. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Walsh, a spokesman for BDO Seidman in New York, said negotiations are 
expected to conclude this week between his firm and partners from the former 
Laventhol office in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would not identify the partners his firm is negotiating with until 
the deal is final. 
</P>
<P>
BDO Seidman, the U.S. member of BDO Binder of Brussels, is the seventh-largest 
accounting firm in the world, with 432 offices in 61 countries. In California, 
BDO Seidman has five offices, in Los Angeles, Orange, San Francisco, Torrance 
and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
People answering the telephone at the former Laventhol &amp; Horwath office in 
Costa Mesa now say simply, "accounting offices." 
</P>
<P>
Three former partners are apparently already working for BDO Seidman: Rich 
Kipper at the company's Los Angeles office, and Brian Wachs and Ron Williamson 
at BDO Seidman in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
BDO Seidman had revenue of $178 million for its fiscal year ended June 30, 
Walsh said, and parent BDO Binder predicts revenue of $1 billion worldwide for 
the year ending Dec. 31. The 80-year-old firm has 269 partners. 
</P>
<P>
Laventhol &amp; Horwath was the nation's seventh-largest accounting firm, with 
350 partners, when it broke up in November. At the time, the company said its 
liabilities far exceeded its assets, although figures were not given. 
</P>
<P>
The company has $85 million in bank debt and there are several pending lawsuits 
alleging poor accounting that could add millions of dollars to the total.

Just when South Coast Plaza shop owners were recovering from a 
company-sponsored spending spree by Isuzu dealers, along came some Yokohama 
Tire dealers with their own incentive program. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, 10 Yokohama dealers hit the shopping mall armed with a special 
credit card that allowed them to charge up to $10,000 in goods from 
participating stores at South Coast Plaza, courtesy of Yokohama Tire Corp. in 
Fullerton, the U.S. distribution arm of Yokohama Rubber Co. of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"This may seem like an early Christmas gift, but in reality it is to reward our 
enthusiastic dealers for a job well done," said Jeff Carpenter, Yokohama 
marketing manager 
</P>
<P>
The credit cards were given to dealers who sold the most tires between Aug. 26 
and Oct. 25. The bigger dealers were eligible to compete for the $10,000 
shopping spree, while the smaller ones were allotted $5,000. The promotion 
mirrors a similar promotion for top-selling Isuzu dealers recently at the Costa 
Mesa shopping mall. The car dealers were granted two shopping days to spend 
between $10,000 and $50,000 each.

PROFITS UP BUT LAYOFFS SEEN AT AIRCRAFT FIRMS 
</P>

Aerospace industry sales, profits and exports were at record levels in 1990, 
paced by a strong commercial aircraft sector, the Aerospace Industries Assn. 
reported Wednesday. But the sales of $131 billion represented a drop of 3.6% on 
an inflation-adjusted basis. 
</P>
<P>
Employment dropped 5% to 1.27 million in 1990 and is expected to drop an 
additional 2% next year, the trade group said. Separately, McDonnell Douglas 
said Wednesday that it may cut another 2,000 jobs at its Douglas Aircraft unit 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Aerospace industry exports have surged this year to $37 billion, a 14% increase 
over last year. Imports were up to a record $11 billion, but the overall trade 
surplus in aerospace reached a milestone $26 billion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for 1991 is for total sales of $133 billion, marking another 3.6% 
decline in inflation-adjusted sales. Although commercial aircraft shipments 
will rise, sales of missiles and military aircraft will slump. 
</P>
<P>
Employment will drop another 2%, according to the industry, a decline of 25,000 
nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Aircraft President Robert Hood said Wednesday that the company is 
currently laying out a business plan for 1991 and may elect to cut another 
2,000 jobs, though such plans have not been finalized yet. 
</P>
<P>
If the firm does eliminate those jobs, the cuts would be handled through 
attrition and not layoffs, Hood said. Attrition runs about 6% of its work 
force, Hood said, meaning the company would expect about 2,400 of its 40,000 
employees to voluntarily leave next year.

HOW TO FLY RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By APRIL JACKSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Combine the stress of the holidays with the anxiety of flying and the average 
passenger will come up with Excedrin Headache No. 358. But not the average 
Orange County traveler using John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Courtney Weircioch, public information officer for John Wayne Airport, said 
airport administrators are predicting smooth sailing both in and out of the new 
Thomas F. Riley Terminal. "Thanksgiving went so well," Weircioch said. "And 
we're expecting the same easy flow of traffic throughout December." 
</P>
<P>
Here's a guide to using the new terminal and taking advantage of a few special 
airline services. 
</P>
<P>
PARKING -- Two main lots are located at either end of the new terminal, a north 
lot and a south lot. Driving up to the airport, signs will designate lots A1 
and A2 or B1 and B2. The north lots (A1 and A2) provide access to gates 1 
through 5, which serve American, Midway, Delta, Continental and Alaska 
airlines. The south lots (B1 and B2) provide access to gates 6 through 10 and 
serve Northwest, TWA, American West, USAir and United airlines. Parking garages 
A1 and B1 provide direct access to the terminal through doors at the ends. 
Garages A2 and B2 provide parking directly in front of the terminal building. 
Parking fees are $1 an hour and $14 a day, changing to $7 for the third day and 
each day thereafter. Departing passengers should use the upper level for 
curbside baggage check-in, ticket counters and gates. To pick up new arrivals, 
use the lower roadway to reach garage areas on the baggage claim level. 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINE TICKETS -- The upper level of the terminal houses ticket counters, 
baggage check-in and gates. Ticket counters for American, Midway, Delta, 
Continental and Alaska airlines are found at the north end of the terminal. 
Northwest, TWA, America West, USAir and United airlines ticket counters are 
located at the south end of the terminal. After picking up tickets, passengers 
walk a few yards to the gates, where they board their waiting planes. 
</P>
<P>
BAGGAGE -- For departing passengers, skycaps (located at the upper level front 
entrance) can tag and check baggage through by placing the baggage on a 
conveyor belt that leads directly to the baggage-handling area. Baggage 
check-in is also available at each end of the terminal at the ticket counters. 
Arriving passengers collect luggage from four carousels on the lower level, 
accessible by stairs, elevators and escalators. Exit doors open out to lower 
roadway for curbside pickup of arrivals and luggage. 
</P>
<P>
GATES -- Each airline is assigned a specific gate, but during the crowded 
holiday season gates may be shared. The terminal has telescoping loading 
bridges that connect 14 gates to individual aircraft. Waiting areas are 
separated by short, two-foot-high dividers. Gates at ends of north and south 
concourses serve small commuter carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Special services offered by airlines: 
</P>
<P>
MEALS -- People with dietary needs can request special in-flight meals. Menus 
vary from low sodium to Hindu, and can be requested through a reservations 
agent at least 24 hours in advance of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
CARGO -- Each airline has specific rules and rates regarding package shipping. 
Call the airlines directly for information. 
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN -- A meet-and-assist program is available where airline personnel 
accompany unassisted children at the terminal to meet their landing party. This 
program requires signed releases and the name(s) and phone numbers of the party 
meeting the child at the airport. Special arrangements can also be made to have 
someone stay with the child during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
DISABLED TRAVELERS -- Two types of wheelchair services are offered: one will 
escort the passenger from the curb to the plane, the second will take the 
disabled passenger to a seat on the plane. Most airlines board people with 
physical disabilities first, but be sure to let the airline know of any special 
needs when reserving tickets. 
</P>
<P>
SEATING -- For extra legroom, request seating at the emergency exit. Those 
seats have wider aisles than the rest of the seating on the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
OVERBOOKED FLIGHTS -- According to the Civil Aeronautics Board, a passenger who 
is bumped from an oversold flight is entitled to up to $450 in denied boarding 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
LOST OR DAMAGED LUGGAGE -- Before leaving the baggage claim area, fill out a 
lost or damage claim report. Get the proper phone numbers to call and check on 
the baggage; some airlines deliver recover baggage free of charge.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: EX-UCI STUDENT'S BOOK BECOMING A MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marti Leimbach's critically acclaimed first novel, "Dying Young," is being 
turned into a movie starring Julia Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
The film, now in production in Mendocino, is scheduled to be released next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Leimbach, who lives in London, began writing the novel as a student in UC 
Irvine's graduate Program in Writing in 1987. It's about a love triangle 
involving a young woman, a terminally ill young man and another man whose 
vitality attracts her. 
</P>
<P>
The novel, published earlier this year, earned the 26-year-old writer nearly 
$500,000, including a $150,000 advance from Doubleday, and the sale of foreign 
rights and motion picture rights. 
</P>
<P>
The film, with a screenplay by Richard Friedenberg, is being made by 20th 
Century-Fox in association with Fogwood Films (Sally Field's production 
company). It also stars Campbell Scott, Colleen Dewhurst and Ellen Burstyn. 
</P>
<P>
UCI professor Donald Heiney, who teaches the fiction-writing workshop, says 
other former graduate students have sold the film rights to their novels -- 
including Michael Chabon ("The Mysteries of Pittsburgh") -- but none have gone 
into production. 
</P>
<P>
As far as Heiney knows, "Dying Young" will be the first feature movie to be 
made from a graduate's work. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Honored: Former Orange Coast College writing instructor Pat Kubis has 
been honored by the Fictionaires, the Orange County writers workshop group. 
</P>
<P>
Kubis is credited with founding the group 25 years ago when members of her 
writing class expressed an interest in continuing their meetings after the 
class ended. Kubis suggested they organize their own group and meet regularly 
at a member's home. 
</P>
<P>
The group now numbers about 30 members and includes some of the county's 
best-known writers, including T. Jefferson Parker, Donald Stanwood, Jackie 
Hyman and Terry Black. 
</P>
<P>
Kubis, who lives in Canyon Lake in Riverside County, was presented with a 
plaque at the Fictionaires' annual Christmas party last weekend.

HIGH LIFE: A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM'S AIM IS SELF-RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GINNY CHANG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Ginny Chang is a junior at Santa Ana 
Valley High School, where she is editor of the Falcon student newspaper, a 
counselor with PAL and senior class representative to Key Club.

"Self-Esteem," "High View of Life" and "Accepting Who You Are" are just three 
of the lessons that will be presented as part of the Respect Yourself program 
at Santa Ana Valley High School this year. 
</P>
<P>
Respect Yourself was introduced last year in an effort to help students meet 
life's challenges, enhance their self-esteem and teach them skills for setting 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
The program, named after the 1971 hit song by the Staple Singers, was 
implemented upon the suggestion of students Donaji Guerrera, Jenny Dang, Victor 
Madrigal and Hanh Nguyen -- members of the school's student government who 
attended a Peer Assistant Leadership camp together during the summer of '89. 
</P>
<P>
"PAL camp was full of positive energy, and we were amazed by how much 
enthusiasm the people had," Guerrera said. "We wanted the same thing for 
Valley. It was just an idea to promote self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Breskin, Santa Ana Valley assistant principal, developed the program's 
curricula, along with a steering committee of staff members and students. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it's important for our school to stand for positive values," 
Breskin said, "and for each student to know that we approve of their choice to 
live a drug-free life." 
</P>
<P>
Respect Yourself lessons and activities began last month and will continue 
through early March. Every Wednesday, at least 15 minutes during third-period 
classes is devoted to lessons developed by the program's self-esteem committee. 
This year's theme, focusing on responsible decision-making, is STAR (Stop, 
Think, Act and Review). 
</P>
<P>
"A program such as Respect Yourself is an excellent way to teach our children 
positive attitudes and success-oriented behavior," said English teacher Sophia 
Theoharopoulos, who heads this year's program. 
</P>
<P>
"A sound code of ethics is essential for success," she said. "We as leaders of 
our community should not leave it to chance and hope the students 'pick it up' 
somewhere. I have a feeling that other schools will be eager to follow in our 
footsteps." 
</P>
<P>
During a recent lesson on setting goals, students discussed the differences 
between long- and short-term goals. Parallels were drawn between goals and road 
maps: Both serve as guides to where people want to go in life. Students were 
asked to focus on what needed to be done to realize their dreams and ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to lessons, a popular on-campus activity of the program is Button 
Day. Students were given Respect Yourself buttons at the beginning of the 
school year and are asked to wear them on Button Day. 
</P>
<P>
The Button Mobile visits a classroom at random during third period for prize 
drawings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it (the program) is a good idea because people need to learn how to 
respect themselves for who they are," said Windy Rowe, a sophomore at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
In January, English and English as a second language students will participate 
in an essay-writing contest. For their efforts, each will receive a Respect 
Yourself pencil, and winners will receive gift certificates. 
</P>
<P>
On Valentine's Day, another prize drawing will be held for movie passes, 
calculators, T-shirts, sweat shirts, gift certificates and a gold ring. 
</P>
<P>
The week before, each teacher gets to hand out 20 "Respect Checks" to students 
who have demonstrated respectful actions in their classroom. Recipients will 
deposit their checks in the Respect Bank during lunch throughout the week, 
which will culminate with the drawing from the bank. 
</P>
<P>
To reward students this month and again in March, teachers will be handing out 
certificates of appreciation for attendance, effort, improvement and 
enthusiastic class participation. 
</P>
<P>
The Respect Yourself program got high marks last year, Breskin said, and is 
expected to continue to do well: "The program is having more impact. It's still 
growing. We are able to provide more assembly programs, and students and staff 
are more committed to the program because they know it's here to stay."

TUSTIN'S TRINITY TO BROADCAST ON SOUTH AFRICAN TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trinity Broadcasting Network of Tustin has been included in a group of 
religious broadcasters approved for time on South Africa's state-owned TV 
networks, the government press association in Pretoria reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The South African Minister of Home Affairs, Gene Louw, said the Christian 
Television Group, which includes Trinity, will be given 30 minutes each weekday 
morning and two hours Sunday on the main government network, TV1, and two hours 
each Sunday morning on the two African-language stations. 
</P>
<P>
The government requires that the religious broadcasts have at least 50% local 
content and contain no advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Trinity's founder and president, Paul Crouch, has been telling viewers for the 
past year that the 24-hour-a-day programming service was hoping for an entire 
channel on the South Africa state system. Trinity already operates a station in 
Ciskei, a black "homeland" in South Africa. SCOTT KRAFT

NEW ALBUM, OLD SHOES KEEP LAINE ON THE RUN

When celebrated pop crooner Frankie Laine -- whose 21-million-selling singles 
from the late 1940s to the middle '60s included "Mule Train," "I Believe," and 
"Rawhide" -- moved to Point Loma in 1968, it was purportedly to retire. 
</P>
<P>
He has yet to do so. In fact, he's getting ready to record a new album in New 
Orleans with jazz trumpeter Al Hirt. 
</P>
<P>
Laine had planned to start recording in January, but Hirt decided to get 
married, which has moved the sessions to March, around the time of Laine's 78th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"Al's getting married to some gal from Minnesota on Dec. 28, and we have to 
wait until he gets back from his honeymoon," Laine said. "And I'm allowing him 
plenty of time to get his honeymooning over with. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we're going to choose the songs, do the backgrounds, go over the 
arrangements, record everything and put the vocals in." 
</P>
<P>
The album, which doesn't yet have a title, will be recorded at a private studio 
owned by New Orleans band leader Ronnie Kole, a longtime friend of both Laine 
and Hirt. 
</P>
<P>
"Ronnie is kind of tying the whole thing together," Laine said. "I gave him the 
idea (for the collaboration) and he flipped and went after Al," Laine said. 
"He's got his own studio and his own record company; he's quite an 
entrepreneur." 
</P>
<P>
Joining Laine and Hirt in the studio will be reed siblings Wynton and Bradford 
Marsalis. "We're asking them each to do a cameo," Laine said. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential guest: Aaron Neville, the resident canary of New Orleans 
rhythm-and-blues group the Neville Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems to be doing a lot of guest appearances these days with people like 
Linda Ronstadt," Laine said, "and we're really hoping to get him." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Laine is keeping busy. San Diego nostalgia radio station KPOP-AM 
(1360) has put together a pre-Christmas promotion around one of his old songs, 
"Old Shoes," seeking donations of old shoes for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Laine and KPOP morning man Don Howard have cut a series of promo spots asking 
listeners to bring their old shoes to any Dixieline Lumber Home Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the people at Dixieline will take the shoes over to the St. Vincent de 
Paul Center so that Father Joe Carroll can disperse them to all the people who 
need them," Laine said. "So far, it's really going well. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got back from San Francisco, where KFRC-AM is picking up on it, and 
we're going to do the same thing up in Los Angeles, at KMPC-AM."

BARBARA WELDON: NEW RESTRAINT;

<P>
MORE POWERFUL PALETTE FOR 'MARA SERIES' AT THE THOMAS BABEOR GALLERY SERVES THE 
PAINTER WELL.

<P>
Cleansed of its former cosmetic beauty, Barbara Weldon's new work bares a 
fresh, honest, more serious and more appealing face. 
</P>
<P>
Her "Mara Series," now on view at the Thomas Babeor Gallery (7470 Girard Ave., 
La Jolla, through Dec. 24) shows a new restraint from the decorative 
gratuitousness that characterized much of the local artist's earlier paintings 
and collages. 
</P>
<P>
Gone -- or at least nearly -- are the synthetic, lipstick colors and 
predictable designs of previous work. Gone also are the triteness of a recent 
series of watercolor collages based on the artist's travels and the stiff 
expressionism of another recent group of abstract paintings on the theme of 
dance. These contrivances are replaced here by a more organic palette and an 
integrity of purpose that breathes life into even the sparest of compositions. 
</P>
<P>
The "Mara Series" was inspired by Weldon's visit to the Masai Mara region of 
East Africa two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the area's geography and culture, Weldon scraped away the finicky 
formulas she had long abided by and began to speak in a more primal tongue. The 
language of hieroglyphic symbols and earthen colors she adopts here is one that 
can't be read literally, but is sensed viscerally. 
</P>
<P>
One of the smaller works on paper, "Mara 67," which measures 30 by 22 inches, 
epitomizes this powerful palette and rich, raw imagery. Here, Weldon paints in 
the colors of blood and bone, layering her tones to a luminous intensity. A 
shield-like form in burnt red floats against a deep ivory ground, its contours 
dissolving into the surface like fine, loose threads. Simple symbols -- 
circles, lines, triangles and X's -- cover the face of the shield shape. These, 
and the spirals, fish and other basic forms that appear throughout the "Mara 
Series" allude not only to the primacy of the elements and the forces of nature 
but to a system of communication and ordering in which symbols truly bear the 
weight of beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
The surfaces of Weldon's larger paintings on paper and canvas, which measure 
nearly 4 feet square, are divided into grids. Each square of the grid contains 
a single hieroglyphic, and in each painting a large, overlaid shape adds 
dimension to the flat patterns and alters the painting's tones. 
</P>
<P>
Though these larger works haven't the concentrated energy of the smaller 
paintings on paper, they, too, reflect the artist's bold move toward more 
meaningful, less obvious beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican painter Rodrigo Pimentel selected the following statement by Octavio 
Paz to introduce his current show at the Iturralde Gallery (7592 Fay Ave., La 
Jolla, through Sunday): "As long as we live we can escape neither masks nor 
names and pronouns: We are inseparable from our fictions -- our features. We 
are condemned to invent ourselves a mask and to discover afterward that the 
mask is our true face." 
</P>
<P>
Pimentel's visual incisiveness may not always equal Paz's way with the word, 
but the artist does offer some engaging commentary of his own on the theme of 
appearance and identity. 
</P>
<P>
Works in his "Carnival" series range from vibrant images of animals and people 
to more metaphoric portraits of the rift dividing internal and external 
realities. Pimentel is at his most provocative when exploring the latter, more 
complex nature of the self. 
</P>
<P>
Among his most engaging paintings are "Los Primeros" (The First Ones) and 
"Sorpresa" (Surprise). In "Los Primeros," perhaps the most subtle, subdued work 
in the show, Pimentel paints a face splayed into thirds. Black, gold and soft 
browns replace his usual heated palette, but an electric vein of blue skids 
through the image, jolting this portrait of multiple, shifting identities to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
In "Sorpresa," Pimentel shows a man removing a mask from his face. The shock 
comes from reversed expectations. The mask, of a jaguar's head, is elegant, 
refined, while the man's face is wild and beast-like, with a nose twisted like 
a golden horn, eyes askew and teeth like a jagged comb. 
</P>
<P>
Pimentel is exuberant in his depiction of carnival behavior, but he also hints 
of the seriousness of the game. Like Paz, he asserts that the act of concealing 
is also one of revealing, that even the most flamboyant masquerade is an honest 
statement of identity. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Museum of Art has scheduled presentations by three notables in 
the arts for its annual series, "Balboa Lectures: Arts and Letters." 
</P>
<P>
Today, writer Mary Lynn Kotz will speak about her upcoming book, "Rauschenberg: 
Art and Life." John Marion, chairman of the auction house Sotheby's North 
America, will deliver a talk titled "Current Trends in the Art Market" on Jan. 
17. The final lecture will be given by Thomas Armstrong III, former director of 
the Whitney Museum of American Art, on Jan. 24. Armstrong's talk is titled 
"Patronage Patterns: The Director's Dilemma." For ticket information, call the 
museum at (619) 232-7931.

POMONA HOPES ROSS WILL MAKE DIFFERENCE AT SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona men's basketball team is hoping the return of forward Terry 
Ross will make the difference when it visits Sacramento State in a 
nonconference game at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Without Ross, listed as one of the top 25 small college players by The Sporting 
News, but who missed the team's first four games because of a broken hand, the 
Broncos lost to Sacramento, 99-83, Nov. 20 in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
But Ross made a big impression in his return to action against NCAA Division I 
San Diego State last week, coming off the bench to score 27 points including 12 
of 18 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos lost to San Diego State, 94-78, despite holding a 45-44 halftime 
lead and have a 3-2 record. Sacramento State is 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Ross, the Broncos are led by forwards Eric Mobley and Ken 
Scalmanini and guard D. J. Norman. Norman averages 12.6 points, Mobley 11.4 
points and 8.4 rebounds and Scalmanini 11.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona will face a Sacramento squad led by center Tim Little, who averages 16.4 
points and 6.8 rebounds, and forward Greg Ballard, who averages 11.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
Following the game against Sacramento, the Broncos will visit UC Davis in 
another nonconference game at 7:30 p.m. Monday. Davis has good scoring balance 
paced by forwards Stephen Smith and Richard Saunders and center Marc Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Off to its best start in school history, the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps men's 
basketball team will attempt to remain undefeated when it plays host to Christ 
College Irvine at 8 p.m. Saturday at Ducey Gym in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont, ranked 7th in NCAA Division III in a preseason poll, enters the game 
at 7-0 and Christ College is 2-7. Sparked by a 57-point showing in the second 
half, Claremont rolled to an 88-71 win over Cal State San Bernardino last week.

LAPD OKS RANDOM DRUG TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rank-and-file members of the Los Angeles Police Department -- the nation's 
third-largest police force -- have agreed to undergo random drug testing 
beginning next year, Mayor Tom Bradley announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, hammered out between the officers' union, department management 
and the mayor's office, represents the first time a major city police force has 
voluntarily agreed to submit to drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
"The integrity of the entire police department depends on everyone, from a 
rookie officer to a 30-year veteran," Bradley said at a City Hall news 
conference. "Mandatory random drug testing is a reliable way to make sure that 
public trust and security will be maintained at all times." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley had long sought such a program, but it was possible only after the 
leadership of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing 
about 7,400 of the department's 8,400 officers, agreed.

<TEXT>
<P>
An earthquake struck Sicily's eastern coast before dawn today, killing at least 
13 people, collapsing buildings and sending panicked residents into the 
streets, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The quake registered a magnitude 4.7, the Ministry of Civil Protection 
reported. The U.S. National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., 
measured it at magnitude 5.1. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the world, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake shook a wide area of 
northeastern Taiwan today, causing landslides and killing two construction 
workers who were knocked off buildings where they were working, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were driven from their homes by the quake in Sicily, and 
many spent the rest of the night in their cars for fear of further shocks. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven bodies were pulled from the rubble in the town of Carlentini, a town of 
10,000 between Catania and Syracuse that was hit hardest by the quake, the 
ministry said. The ministry said two other people died of heart attacks after 
the quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian news agency ANSA said two of the bodies recovered were 18-month-old 
toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
At least 200 people were injured, the Italian news agency AGI said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a huge roar all of a sudden. Everything shook," said Sebastiano 
Valvo, an employee at the Syracuse prefect's office, describing the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue crews were digging people out of collapsed buildings in a driving rain 
and making inspections in towns hit hardest by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
The quake's epicenter was in the Gulf of Noto, about 30 miles southeast of 
Syracuse, said the National Institute of Geophysics. 
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Protection said 1,300 people were left homeless in 
Carlentini. Five people there were seriously injured, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
The quake caused at least $400 million in damage, according to the Syracuse 
prefect's office. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau said the 11:01 a.m. quake was centered on the 
coast about six miles south of Hualien. 
</P>
<P>
Police there said one construction worker died after falling from the second 
story of the building and that a laborer shaken off a scaffold died of head 
injuries.

JUDGE DROPS SUICIDE-DEVICE MURDER CASE 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge today threw out a murder charge against Dr. Jack Kevorkian in the death 
of an Alzheimer's disease patient who used his so-called suicide machine to 
take her life. 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian turned and shook hands with a defense attorney after Clarkston 
District Judge Gerald McNally dismissed a first-degree murder charge in the 
death of Janet Adkins. 
</P>
<P>
McNally said prosecutors failed to prove Kevorkian planned and carried out 
Adkins' death June 4, adding that she, not Kevorkian, caused the death. 
</P>
<P>
McNally, noting Michigan has no specific law against assisting suicide, said it 
is up to the Legislature to clarify state law. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Michael Modelski said he would 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
McNally's ruling came after a two-day preliminary hearing to determine whether 
Kevorkian, of suburban Royal Oak, should stand trial. An outspoken advocate of 
the concept of doctor-assisted suicide for the terminally ill, Kevorkian has 
acknowledged hooking up Adkins to his machine, which put a lethal combination 
of drugs into her bloodstream after she pushed a button. 
</P>
<P>
The only alternatives available to the judge today were allowing the 
first-degree murder charge to go to trial or throwing it out. He could not 
substitute a lesser charge. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, attorneys introduced a suicide note purportedly signed by Adkins, 
saying she freely chose to have Kevorkian help her commit suicide before she 
deteriorated further from Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a decision taken in a normal state of mind and is freely considered," 
the note read. "I have Alzheimer's disease and I don't want it to progress any 
further. I don't want to put myself or my family through any more of this 
terrible disease." 
</P>
<P>
Adkins, 54, of Portland, Ore., died shortly after noon June 4. Later that day, 
Kevorkian let police search his van and seize his device before offering a 
statement about his role in Adkins' death.

U.S. ENVOY LEAVES KUWAIT; 
</P>
<P>
SUBSISTED ON TUNA FISH FOR MONTHS

<P>
A final evacuation flight landed in Germany today carrying the U.S. ambassador 
to Kuwait and his staff, who survived a 110-day Iraqi siege of their embassy by 
living on tuna fish and drinking water from a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Nathaniel Howell, his deputy chief of mission, Barbara Bodine, and 
three other American diplomats in Kuwait left their embassy early today and 
flew to Baghdad and then Frankfurt aboard a U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways plane, 
which also carried 25 other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
While Iraq was allowing the completion of a blanket hostage release announced 
one week ago, the White House and Baghdad exchanged angry accusations today 
over the dates of proposed high-level talks. But both stopped short of calling 
off the peace effort, which is seen as the last chance of averting war in the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Iraq had still not offered 
acceptable dates for the talks and did not seem to be taking the U.S. peace bid 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry denounced Washington for rejecting its 
proposed date of Jan. 12 for Baker to visit Baghdad and accused it of 
suggesting the talks only as a cover for war. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Ambassador Howell, looking thinner from the ordeal and with his 
gray hair longer, told reporters that his staff left the embassy "with the flag 
flying." 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy to be here. We're delighted that Americans who wanted to 
leave did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the embassy staff had endured, as reported, a diet of tuna sandwiches, 
Howell deadpanned: "No, the bread ran out." 
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old diplomat declined to speak at length, explaining that "we 
haven't had electricity and water, hot water, at night for 110 days. So, we're 
going to take advantage of that." 
</P>
<P>
The passengers were booked into a luxury hotel near the Frankfurt airport and 
are expected to fly home Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad said the compound in Kuwait was left 
unstaffed but open and that Iraqi authorities had pledged it would not be 
disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
The departure of the American diplomats ended a four-month diplomatic standoff 
between the United States and Iraq. Washington had defied Iraqi orders to close 
the mission in August. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy officials at the Baghdad airport said 94 people were on the flight 
to Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
It was the final U.S.-chartered flight evacuating hostages, and was said to be 
the last chartered by any country. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Baghdad said all foreigners who missed the charter could leave 
later by regular flights or by ground transportation.

PENTAGON STARTS BLOOD PROGRAM IN CASE OF WAR; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: IT IS THE FIRST TIME THE EMERGENCY COLLECTION PLAN HAS BEEN PUT 
INTO EFFECT.

The Pentagon has for the first time activated an emergency civilian blood 
collection program to prepare for fighting in the Persian Gulf, blood bank 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross and American Assn. of Blood Banks received notification 
from the Pentagon to activate an emergency blood supply contract called the 
Armed Services Blood Program, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Monday, each association has been asked to begin sending 375 units of 
blood to McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey each week and were told to 
prepare to supply a minimum of 800 units of blood per day if fighting breaks 
out, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The military usually collects most of the blood it needs for transfusions from 
military personnel but it faces the possibility of shortages because so many 
troops have been sent to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is they just deployed a lot of troops and are implementing this 
contract to cover themselves -- to make sure their needs are met," said Marcia 
Lane of the American Assn. of Blood Banks, which operates 2,400 blood centers 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"They have had some planning ongoing and they have determined how much blood 
they need at this point and how much they will need if hostilities break out, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the military has had an agreement with civilian blood centers to 
supply blood in emergencies since World War II, the plan has never before been 
invoked, even during the Vietnam War, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unusual because the military didn't need to ask us for it during 
Vietnam. My guess is Vietnam was a long-drawn-out, low-level conflict, whereas 
if conflict does occur in the gulf it will be much more intense and therefore 
require much more blood at once to treat the wounded soldiers," said Elizabeth 
Hall of the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to compensating for the lack of military donors, the activation of 
the contract is aimed at making sure any problems with the system are worked 
out before blood is needed urgently for wounded soldiers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of a preparedness measure for both the Red Cross and military to 
ensure smooth shipment if needed," Hall said. "Just in case they need us they 
want to make sure the system is working to get it to them." 
</P>
<P>
The request for 375 units of blood weekly will not put a strain on the civilian 
blood collection system, and neither association plans to call for more 
donations immediately, officials said.

STUDY OF NEW-CAR SALES FINDS THAT WHITE MEN GET BEST DEALS

<P>
White men who bargain on the price of a new car get better deals than women or 
blacks, a study of auto dealerships shows. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Ayres, a Northwestern University law professor who wrote the study, 
suggested that the apparent discrimination may be the result of car salespeople 
looking for "suckers" to concentrate profits by targeting a relatively few 
customers who will pay higher markups. 
</P>
<P>
Black women were offered the highest prices, averaging $875 per car more than 
white men, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
Salespeople may assume that blacks and women are less knowledgeable about cars 
and the bargaining process than white males, and therefore more willing to 
accept a higher price, said Ayres, whose study is to be published in the 
Harvard Law Review's February issue. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Wilbur, a spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Assn., said he 
had not seen the research and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
The findings by a research group established by the American Bar Assn. were 
based on visits to Chicago-area dealerships by researchers posing as 
middle-class car buyers. The researchers were prepared with carefully rehearsed 
negotiating tactics to get the best offer from salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, three white male researchers divided among themselves 90 car 
dealerships, then visited them, trying to get the best deal on the same new 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the dealerships was also visited by one of three other researchers -- a 
white woman, a black woman and a black man -- who bargained over the same car. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that white men received final offers that averaged about 
$11,362 on a new car with a sticker price of $13,465. 
</P>
<P>
The white woman was given an average final price of $11,504, the black man an 
average final price of $11,783 and the black woman an average price of $12,237. 
</P>
<P>
Ayres noted that discrimination appeared to be a factor even in the dealer's 
initial offer, before negotiations had begun, when the same pattern of 
increasing prices was given to white men, the white woman, black man and black 
woman.

Albania rushed soldiers to a town in the isolated Balkan republic today to 
quell an attack on Communist Party officials and buildings by "hooligans" armed 
with stones and iron bars, a broadcast said. 
</P>
<P>
The attack in the northern city of Shkodra came the day after a peaceful rally 
by tens of thousands of people in the capital, Tirana, founded the country's 
first non-Communist political party. It was not clear whether the army used 
weapons or whether the situation had quieted.

<P>
A 16th-Century gold thimble believed to have belonged to Queen Elizabeth I was 
bought by London jewelers today for $38,600, a record price for a thimble. 
</P>
<P>
The 1-inch-long thimble, set with tiny rubies and paste sapphires, was probably 
part of a gift from the Mogul Empire in India to the queen. It was later given 
to one of her ladies-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record price for a thimble was $14,600. 
</P>
<P>
The thimble was from the estate of Dorothy Silvester. She inherited a 
collection from her mother, Dorothy Howell, once described in a collectors' 
guide as "The Queen of Thimbles."

Germany's largest electricity utility, RWE AG, today agreed to pay $590 million 
for Vista Chemical Co., the latest takeover of an American chemical company by 
a foreign industrial giant. 
</P>
<P>
News of the friendly deal sent Vista shares soaring on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where it was among the five most actively traded stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The German company's RWE-DEA AG division said it plans to start a $55-a-share 
tender offer for Houston-based Vista Chemical by Dec. 19. RWE-DEA said the 
tender is expected to be completed by early 1991 and the merger wrapped up on 
July 1.

Mobil Oil Corp. has temporarily suspended its search for oil in Peru's jungle 
after an attack by leftist rebels destroyed a jungle surveying camp it had 
operated. 
</P>
<P>
The attack this week was the most serious against Peru's oil industry in 10 
years of political violence, as well as the largest ever against a foreign 
company in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Peru's energy minister, Fernando Sanchez Albavera, said Wednesday that New 
York-based Mobil would resume its survey operations in six to eight months with 
Peru's army providing protection for the surveyors. But a Mobil spokesman 
refused to say when exploration would be resumed. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-Cuban rebels on Monday took over Mobil's survey camp in the Upper Huallaga 
valley, 270 miles northeast of Lima. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels, from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Group, blew up vehicles, 
equipment and buildings and stole a helicopter. No one was hurt in the camp, 
operated by a Mobil subcontractor, the Halliburton Geophysical Service.

Five Napa Valley wines and one from Washington State are among the world's top 
10, according to the latest annual list by an internationally respected wine 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
The list of the 100 greatest wines ranked by quality and price by the Wine 
Spectator marks the first time in the magazine's three-year survey that 
California wines have outnumbered French ones in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley Private Reserve 1986, $30, topped the 
list, followed by the $50 Caymus Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley Special 
Selection 1985. Caymus was rated No. 1 last year for its 1984 Special 
Selection. 
</P>
<P>
Other Napa Valley wines in the top 10 were: $60 Heitz Cabernet Sauvignon Napa 
Valley, Martha's Vineyard 1985, No. 5; $68 Opus One Napa Valley 1987, No. 6, 
and $36 Spottswoode Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley, 1987, No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward Canyon Cabernet Sauvignon Columbia Valley, at $18.50, was in 10th 
place. It was the first time a Washington State wine broke into the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
The Wine Spectator put two French wines among the top 10. Chartron et Trebuchet 
Chassagne-Montrachet Les Morgeots 1988, $34, was No. 3, and Daniel Rion 
Nuits-St.-Georges Les Vignes Rondes 1987, $35, was No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Italy's $36 Poggio Antico Brunello di Montalcino 1985 was No. 4, and Germany's 
$24 Joh. Jos. Prum Riesling Spatlese Wehlener Sonnenuhr (Cask 2) 1988, was No. 
8.

The Reedy Creek Improvement District, Disney's governmental arm, was set to

"We have talked to the Orioles," Jim Ronstadt, director of the Tucson Parks and

The Orioles, who trained in Yuma in 1954 and in Scottsdale in 1956-58, have no 
home stadium for the 1991 Grapefruit League season in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore played its spring training home games at Miami Stadium from 1959-90 
but has left the park because it is old and there is no room for expansion or 
the addition of other training facilities, said Bob Miller, a team spokesman.

Heisman Trophy winner Ty Detmer today received another individual honor with 
the Maxwell Award as the outstanding college football player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Brigham Young quarterback, a junior, easily outdistanced Raghib (Rocket) 
Ismail of Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer garnered 1,993 points on a 3-2-1 vote system, with 413 first-place votes 
among the 878 ballots cast by coaches, media and Maxwell Football Club members. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail had 1,385 points, Colorado's Eric Bieniemy 747 and Virginia's Shawn 
Moore 431. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer passed for 300 yards in 23 straight games and led the 13th-ranked 
Cougars (10-2) to a Dec. 29 matchup with Texas A&amp;M in the Holiday Bowl. He 
has set or tied 25 NCAA passing or total offense records. 
</P>
<P>
He is the first quarterback to win the award since Syracuse's Don McPherson won 
it in 1987. Running backs Barry Sanders of Oklahoma State and Anthony Thompson 
of Indiana won it the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Maxwell Club also today announced that Penn State's Joe Paterno won the 
second annual George Munger Award as outstanding college coach. 
</P>
<P>
Grambling Coach Eddie Robinson won the Bagnell Award for outstanding 
contributions to football. 
</P>
<P>
All will be honored at the club's awards dinner Feb. 19.

Coach Sam Wyche gave a tongue-lashing to his Cincinnati Bengals players for 
what he perceived as a lackluster preparation for Sunday's game against the 
Raiders in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a couple of players who aren't happy with me right now," Wyche said 
following a private session with his players after Wednesday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they're so mad they'll play better." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe, as much as anything, we need to get ourselves back on track for the 
Raiders game," Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Boomer Esiason said Wyche was pretty upset with some members of the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"In some respects, it was long overdue," Esiason said. "I don't blame him. The 
coaches aren't paid to be our friends. They're paid to be our critics."

U.S. Davis Cup hero Michael Chang became the first player to reach the 
semifinals of the $6-million Grand Slam Cup when he beat Frenchman Henri 
Leconte today, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, the 1989 French Open champion from Placentia, Calif., kept his 
concentration despite Leconte's constant clowning and will play either Pete 
Sampras or Yugoslavia's Goran Ivanisevic in Saturday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
The victory guaranteed Chang, who beat world No. 1 Stefan Edberg in the opening 
round, at least $450,000 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed Leconte, who broke Chang as he served for the first set but 
lost the tiebreaker, 7-3, took home $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Leconte, who had to pull out of last month's Paris indoor tournament with a 
knee injury, had more and more trouble with his serve as the match progressed. 
</P>
<P>
The 30th-ranked Frenchman, who beat seventh seed Thomas Muster of Austria in 
the first round, broke Chang to go 2-1 up in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
But he served two double faults to help Chang pull even in the next game and 
collapsed to the floor in disgust after giving away the third break point. 
</P>
<P>
Broken again in the sixth game, again with a pair of double faults along the 
way, Leconte was unable to get back into the match. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, the Placentia teen-ager who helped the United States win the Davis Cup 
final against Australia nearly two weeks ago, chased every ball across the 
carpet court and maintained the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
He got to match point on serve and then had the satisfaction of seeing the 
tiring Leconte put a service return into the net.

<P>
FIFA, soccer's world governing body, gave Africa an extra World Cup place at 
the expense of Europe but sidestepped the controversial issue of widening goals 
at its executive meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA decided to create a task force to looks at ways of improving the game 
after criticism of the standard of play and the low number of goals at this 
year's World Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
General Secretary Sepp Blatter declined to speculate on what changes might be 
proposed and refused to comment on earlier reports that FIFA was considering 
widening goals or reducing teams to 10 players. 
</P>
<P>
But he said, they will be looking at ways of making the game more exciting. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to go for goals. Soccer is about getting the ball in the net," Blatter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The FIFA task force will meet in February, but Blatter did not say whether 
proposals will be submitted to the annual rule-making International Board 
meeting in June. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Soccer Federation President Alan Rothenberg had sent FIFA President Joao 
Havelange a letter urging rules changes that would encourage more scoring. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that other sports had "changed their rules when an imbalance between 
offense and defense has threatened the growth and enjoyment of the sport. Such 
an imbalance now threatens our sport." 
</P>
<P>
The move to give Africa an extra World Cup berth was proposed by Havelange 
after Egypt and Cameroon put on outstanding performances last summer, but it 
needed approval from the 29-member executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
For the 1994 finals, to be played in the United States, Europe will have 13 of 
the 24 berths, including the slot given to the defending champion -- in this 
case, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA also gave the Central and North American region a chance at a third berth 
but no guarantee. The region has two guaranteed spots. 
</P>
<P>
Asia's bid for a third berth was rejected, partly because of Asian teams' 
disappointing showing at the last World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Action was taken against three countries. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica was suspended for two years from all FIFA youth competitions, 
including the Olympic soccer tournament, for fielding an overage player in a 
1985 tournament. The case was uncovered when the same player, Hernan Medford, 
listed a different age when playing for Costa Rica at last summer's World Cup 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia was barred indefinitely from hosting international games of any kind 
because turmoil in the country was deemed a safety risk for soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq was effectively banned from international soccer until the gulf crisis is 
resolved. FIFA had previously banned all such games in Iraq, but the new 
sanction forbids any country to host Iraqi teams.

The Treasury Department said today it has settled a year-old lawsuit filed by 
Capital Cities/ABC Inc. regarding royalty payments to Cuba in connection with 
the broadcast of the 1991 Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the settlement allow ABC Sports to make limited payments to Cuba for 
goods and services provided by Cuban nationals during the broadcast of the 
games next year. 
</P>
<P>
Such payments have been prohibited under a comprehensive U.S. economic embargo 
against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
The government said ABC's proposal for live coverage of the games included an 
indirect royalty payment of $6.5 million to Cuba for the exclusive U.S. 
broadcasting rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control had rejected ABC's application 
to broadcast the games because of the proposed royalty payment.

"Dances With Wolves," an Orion film directed by and starring Kevin Costner, was 
named best movie of 1990 by the National Board of Review, the world's oldest 
award-giving film group. 
</P>
<P>
The National Board also named Costner best director of the year for his work on 
the film, but its best actor award was shared by Robin Williams and Robert De 
Niro for "Awakenings." 
</P>
<P>
The best actress award went to Mia Farrow for "Alice," which is being released 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
The awards, considered accurate predictors of the Oscars, are voted by the 
board's membership, including educators, film critics and film historians. The 
board was founded in 1909 and has been giving its annual awards since 1917. 
</P>
<P>
The award for best supporting actor went to Joe Pesci in "GoodFellas." Winona 
Ryder won best supporting actress for her role in "Mermaids." 
</P>
<P>
The best foreign language film is "Cyrano de Bergerac," from France, starring 
Gerard Depardieu. 
</P>
<P>
The best made-for-television film award went to "Andre's Mother," PBS.

BUST OF ELVIS RESURRECTED; BUYERS ALREADY BIDDING

That 1,400-pound bust of Elvis Presley -- used on Mississippi's float in the 
Rose Parade a year ago and later sent to the scrap heap -- has been resurrected 
for a bid equivalent to 5.4 cents per pound. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles sculptor Ralph Eaton and his partner, Brett Waller, are willing to 
pay $75 for the battered and crumbling bust and removing it from a Jackson 
scrap yard where it has been moldering for about eight months. 
</P>
<P>
But the singer's Graceland estate also wants the bust, as does a Los Angeles 
radio station that trucked it to his Memphis, Tenn., mansion as a publicity 
stunt in January. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi's Tournament of Roses float included busts of three other 
Mississippi musicians: blues guitarist B. B. King, country star Tammy Wynette 
and opera singer Leontyne Price. 
</P>
<P>
Those three busts were dismantled in Pasadena after the parade. But two Los 
Angeles morning disc jockeys, "Mark and Brian," salvaged the Presley bust for a 
cross-country trip to Graceland. 
</P>
<P>
Graceland Executive Director Jack Soden said the radio jokesters exploited the 
Presley estate. 
</P>
<P>
Soden wasn't any happier to learn Wednesday that the bust will be resurrected. 
</P>
<P>
Soden said he hopes to make an offer on the bust as well, starting at a bid of 
$76, a dollar higher than Eaton and Waller. "That's one way to make the problem 
go away," Soden said. 
</P>
<P>
But Soden will have to get in line with Los Angeles radio station KLOS-FM, 
which wants it back in Los Angeles for Presley's birthday Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The scrap yard, Cash for Cans, bought the bust for $13.80 from the Mississippi 
Tournament of Roses Assn., which raised $100,000 to build it. 
</P>
<P>
Eaton, who builds floats for the Rose Parade as a sideline, plans to restore 
the 10-foot-tall bust to its regal glory. 
</P>
<P>
"We're great admirers of The King," Eaton said. "After discovering he'd been 
sitting in a junkyard, we decided to give him a good home."

<P>
There are not many movies that get a round of applause even before they start, 
but "The Godfather Part III" pulled that extraordinary feat as the curtain went 
up in Los Angeles on its first public showing. 
</P>
<P>
In even better news for Paramount Pictures, which has invested at least $58 
million in the highly anticipated sequel, the Wednesday screening produced 
robust applause as the final credits rolled. 
</P>
<P>
"Without question, this is the one everybody's talking about," said John Krier, 
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. "Ever since 'Dick Tracy,' all the 
talk has been about 'Godfather.' " 
</P>
<P>
Michael Medved, a reviewer for the television show "Sneak Previews," called the 
movie "impressive. If there was a Medved scale, it would be about a nine." 
</P>
<P>
The film will open Christmas Day on 1,800 screens in the United States and 
Canada.

Playwright John Guare says the burden of good theater rests not only with 
actors, directors and writers. Audiences need to shoulder their share of the 
load, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The audience should demand that the truth be told," Guare said Wednesday at a 
convention of the American Council for the Arts. "Not the TV truth of diapers 
and cat food, which has to be nice and likable or else you turn it off." 
</P>
<P>
Theater buffs must demand the kind of truth that makes one say, "I've been 
prepared for the great moments in my life -- birth, love and death. I've been 
there before because I've been prepared by art," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Guare wrote the screenplay for "Atlantic City," the Tony-winning play "The 
House of Blue Leaves" and the play "Six Degrees of Separation."

TESTING: ESPRESSO MACHINES POUPLAR GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost all of the espresso machines on the market can be divided into two 
categories: steam systems and pump systems. Because these appliances are so 
often bought as Christmas gifts, they are timely candidates for this column. 
</P>
<P>
Six steam units and eight pump units were borrowed from their manufacturers for 
evaluation. The 14 machines included models manufactured in Italy, Switzerland, 
Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of the units range from $66 to $500. (Dollar amounts listed are 
suggested retail prices; units can often be purchased at reduced prices.) 
Although machines within each of the two categories operate similarly, there 
are subtle differences and it's important to read and follow the manufacturer's 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Steam units currently account for about 70% of espresso machine sales in this 
country. They are the least expensive, ranging from $66 to $200. 
</P>
<P>
In steam machines, water heats in a chamber until enough pressure has built up 
to force it through the ground coffee. In most steam machines, the entire 
amount of water in the chamber flows through at once. 
</P>
<P>
These units produce coffee that is denser than that made in a drip or filter 
coffee maker, but do not produce the crema, or tan-colored foam, that is a sign 
of high-quality espresso (Please see Tips for Using an Espresso Machine on Page 
47 for a full explanation). Steam produced by these machines typically 
increases the volume of 1/4 cup of milk to 1/3 or 1/2 cup. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the six steam machines tested offered the option of producing either 
two or four cups of espresso, plus steam for frothing milk to make cappuccino. 
The sixth unit, Neon Cafe Amore, had the capability of producing from one to 
six cups of espresso plus steam. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the machines provided much space for overflow. This is not a 
problem when the coffee flows into a carafe, but it can be when a two-cup 
adapter is used and the unit produces more than two cups of liquid. It was also 
a problem when the coffee valve on one Neon Cafe Amore machine malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
Pump machines are more expensive than steam machines ($235 to $500). In these 
units water is stored in a reservoir then heated and sent under pressure 
through the coffee grounds. Pump machines offer the option of making one or two 
cups of espresso at a time. The steam generated by these machines typically 
increases the volume of a 1/4 cup of milk from 1/2 to a full cup. 
</P>
<P>
All of the units tested had good overflow space and removable drip trays. This 
is important since the machines tend to drip water and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
For optimum flavor, the temperature of the water should be just below boiling 
when it comes in contact with the coffee grounds. 
</P>
<P>
CONCLUSIONS: 
</P>
<P>
It takes time and experimentation to produce the best espresso/cappuccino from 
any machine. Follow the manufacturer's instructions plus the guidelines on Page 
47 for selecting and grinding coffee. 
</P>
<P>
If you truly care about good espresso, you won't be satisfied with a steam 
machine, even though they are less expensive, easy to use and typically have 
fewer mechanical problems. They cannot produce a high-quality espresso with 
crema, so are best used for making cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
Pump machines produce better to excellent quality espresso with crema. These 
are higher in price, more complicated and messier to use and subject to more 
mechanical problems. 
</P>
<P>
EVALUATION: 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of units that had mechanical problems, all machines were 
tested several times, following the manufacturer's directions as closely as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>

FOOTBALL: LINEMEN, BACKS AND COACHES OF THE YEAR WILL BE HONORED AT ANNUAL 
AWARDS BREAKFAST SUNDAY IN ANAHEIM. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Friday nights were when they shined, in an atmosphere of liniment, damp earth 
and perfume, and amid a colorful swirl, seen from behind their face masks, of 
classmates, parents, thumping bands, raging coaches and chanting cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
Those who shined the brightest form the 1990 Times South Coast All-Star High 
School Football Team. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, which came within an eyelash of a third consecutive CIF Southern 
Section title, has five players on the all-star team, including back of the 
year Leon Neal and lineman of the year Mark Manu. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, who lost last Saturday night to Capistrano Valley, 17-15, on a 
field goal with 16 seconds to play, finished 13-1. They also have the coach of 
the year, Ken Sutch, who has a 38-3 record the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Sutch, Neal and Manu will be honored at an awards breakfast at 8:30 a.m. Sunday 
at the Anaheim Hilton Hotel. The winner of the Glenn Davis Trophy for the best 
player in Southern California will be presented at the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
The All-South Coast team, selected on the basis of a poll of coaches: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OFFENSE 
</P>
<P>
Joel Rosborough, Jordan, wide receiver -- A repeater on the All-South Coast 
team, the 6-4 senior led the Long Beach area in touchdown pass receptions and 
averaged 22 yards per catch. Four of his TDs were more than 60 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Henderson, Paramount, wide receiver -- Great speed enabled Henderson to 
average 28 yards on 10 catches, six of them for touchdowns during the regular 
season. He is a 23-foot long jumper. 
</P>
<P>
Alphonso Bigelow, Paramount, tight end -- He made the Pirate offense go with 
his great blocking. He also caught 12 regular-season passes, averaging 20 yards 
a reception, and scored six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Waters, Wilson, tackle -- At 6-5 and 245 pounds, Waters is sought by UCLA 
and Stanford. He is a good drive blocker, protects the quarterback well and has 
a 3.7 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Butcher, Poly, tackle -- A two-year starter, he used his 280 pounds to 
lead runners when they needed tough yardage. 
</P>
<P>
Mike McCormick, Lakewood, center -- A quick player off the ball with good 
blocking skills, McCormick also displayed the leadership that helped Lakewood 
make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Hopkins, Poly, guard -- "He's going to be a big-time player," said 
Thomas Whiting, Poly's co-head coach. Hopkins bench-presses 315 pounds, runs 
the 40-yard dash in 4.85 seconds and has a 3.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Each, Lakewood, guard -- Each showed great speed as a pulling guard and 
was an efficient blocker. Lakewood Coach Mark Rose expects Each to add bulk to 
his 6-4, 190-pound frame. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Nansen, Jordan, quarterback -- A junior, he led the Moore League in 
passing with more than 900 yards, and also ran for 500 yards. "He is the 
dominant player in our league, possibly in the area," Jordan Coach Mike Ono 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Neal, Paramount, back -- He easily won South Coast back of the year by 
rushing for more than 1,500 yards, averaging more than 9 yards a carry. He 
scored 16 touchdowns and averaged 14 yards each time he caught a pass. 
</P>
<P>
Dione Tyler, Millikan, back -- "He redefines the word quick," Millikan Coach 
Dave Radford said. Tyler, a junior, was the Moore League's only 1,000-yard 
rusher and averaged 10 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Wassmuth, Lakewood, kicker -- He made 21 of 22 extra-point attempts and 
his longest field goal was 42 yards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
Larry Satterlee, Millikan, lineman -- A three-year starter, he has the 
instincts and technique his position demands. He was all-Moore League and 
all-Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Fia Ili, Poly, lineman -- The only sophomore on the all-star team, Ili was 
Poly's most consistent defensive lineman. He is quick, aggressive, a good pass 
rusher and a fast learner. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Rogers, Dominguez, lineman -- A three-year starter, Rogers utilized his 
quickness to lead the Dons in sacks with 16. "He dances to a different 
drummer," said Dominguez Coach Willie Donerson, who was amused by the way 
Rogers would go off by himself before a game, then rejoin his teammates and 
become a leader. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Manu, Paramount, lineman -- A 6-2, 200-pound senior with great quickness, 
Manu was all-San Gabriel Valley League as an offensive guard and a defensive 
tackle, and the South Coast lineman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Russell, Wilson, linebacker -- A junior, he led the Bruins with 87 
assisted tackles and 37 unassisted tackles and was the co-most valuable 
defensive player in the Moore League. He also rushed for 830 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Moss, Millikan, linebacker -- It was not advisable to run on Moss, the 
Millikan captain who, at 5-11 and 180 pounds, is the Moore League weightlifting 
champion. A two-year starter, he was the Rams' top defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Pearson, Jordan, linebacker -- A 6-3, 210-pound senior, Pearson led the 
Panthers with 12 sacks from his outside linebacking position, and was also one 
of their leading tacklers. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Belman, Lakewood, linebacker -- The Moore League's defensive player of the 
year, the quick, aggressive Belman led Lakewood in tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie King, Jordan, back -- A 6-1, 215-pound senior, he led the Panthers in 
tackles and also had four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Avila, Paramount, back -- "Awesome," is how Coach Sutch describes 
Avila's hitting. A first-team all-San Gabriel Valley League choice, he had 45 
unassisted tackles and assisted on 27 others. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Jones, Poly, back -- Playing varsity football for the first time, Jones 
could be depended on to break up crucial passes. "He was probably the best 
cornerback in the area," said Whiting, his coach.

<P>
Friday nights were when they shined, in an atmosphere of liniment, damp earth 
and perfume, and amid a colorful swirl, seen from behind their face masks, of 
classmates, parents, thumping bands, raging coaches and chanting cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
Those who shined the brightest form the 1990 Times Southeast All-Star High 
School Football Team. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen schools are represented on the all-star team, led by Bell Gardens with 
three players, including back/wide receiver of the year Jesse Rafanan. 
</P>
<P>
The lineman of the year is Fernando Hernandez of Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Coach of the year is Willie Norman of Glenn High in Norwalk. His team was 
plagued with injuries and one of his best players was seriously wounded in a 
post-game shooting, but Norman still led the Eagles to a 9-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
Norman, Rafanan and Hernandez will be honored at an awards breakfast at 8:30 
a.m. Sunday at the Anaheim Hilton Hotel. The winner of the Glenn Davis Trophy 
for the best player in Southern California will be presented at the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
The all-Southeast team, selected on the basis of a poll of coaches: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OFFENSE 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Rafanan, Bell Gardens, wide receiver -- "He's a great player, one of the 
best I've had," Bell Gardens Coach Dave Newell said of the 6-3, 185-pound 
Rafanan, the Southeast back/receiver of the year. Rafanan caught 41 passes for 
773 yards and seven touchdowns. He also had 41 tackles and eight interceptions 
and was the most valuable player of the Whitmont League. 
</P>
<P>
Juaquin Hawkins, Lynwood, wide receiver -- The 6-7 Hawkins caught 20 passes for 
343 yards and two touchdowns. As a defensive back, he was in on 78 tackles and 
had five interceptions and three blocked kicks. He is going to Cal State Long 
Beach as a basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Granillo, St. Paul, tight end -- The 6-4, 220-pound Granillo, who was 
all-Mission League, had a 13-yard average on pass catches and excelled as a 
blocker. "We ran to his side," said Swordsmen Coach Miguel Olmedo. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Ramirez, South Gate, lineman -- South Gate Coach Gary Cordray calls 
Ramirez a "super pass blocker." Ramirez, who can bench-press 280 pounds and run 
the 40-yard dash in 4.9 seconds, started for three years, during which the Rams 
were 29-6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cardona, La Mirada, lineman -- A repeater on the all-Southeast team, 
Cardona, at 6 feet 4 and 275 pounds, is a Division I college prospect. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Hicks, El Rancho, lineman -- "The most dominant run blocker I have coached 
or seen in 28 years of coaching," said El Rancho Coach Dick Shelko of this 
16-year-old senior, who is 6 feet 5 and 285 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan McEntire, Whittier Christian, lineman -- This senior guard was the key 
blocker on the CIF champion Heralds. He was the Olympic League's lineman of the 
year and has a 3.95 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Galindo, Bell Gardens, lineman -- He was positioned wherever the running 
attack was because he was such a great drive blocker. For a big man (250 
pounds), he is very quick. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Haney, California, quarterback -- This junior, who completed 198 of 338 
passes for 2,256 yards and 22 touchdowns, led the Condors to their first 
playoff appearance in 10 years. He was the Whitmont League's offensive back of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Darnell Morgan, Norwalk, back -- A sample of Morgan's stunning statistics: 
1,482 yards gained, 9.75 yards a carry, 18 touchdowns, 14 pass catches. He also 
scored two 2-point conversions for a total of 112 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Rector, Whittier Christian, back -- On a champion team that averaged 45 
points a game, the 5-10, 155-pound senior gained 1,349 yards on 162 attempts 
and scored 20 TDs. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Trujillo, California, kicker -- He made 26 of 33 extra points and seven of 
eight field goal attempts, including two that won overtime games. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
Les Redewill, La Serna, lineman -- "He was kind of the clown on the team who 
kept everybody loose, but he was one of our hardest workers," said Coach Wayne 
Manzo of his senior captain. Redewill had 51 tackles, three fumble recoveries 
and three sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Norton, St. Paul, lineman -- He led the Swordsmen into the playoffs with 11 
sacks and 30 tackles. "An excellent player and person," said Coach Miguel 
Olmedo of the Mission League's lineman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Demetrious Maxie, Downey, lineman -- The San Gabriel Valley League's defensive 
player of the year had 69 tackles, four sacks and two fumble recoveries. A 
senior being recruited by Nevada Las Vegas, Maxie also made the all-league 
offensive team as a tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Hernandez, Whittier, lineman -- The Southeast lineman of the year, 
Hernandez would not come off the field until the final gun. He had a 
combination of speed, quickness, competitiveness and intelligence, said his 
coach, Mike Fitch. He was all-Whitmont League on defense and offense. He 
weighed 240 pounds as a junior but came into this season at 220. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Overgaauw, Valley Christian, linebacker -- A 6-2, 185-pound senior, he had 
30 tackles, six sacks and three interceptions. As a tight end, he caught 20 
passes, including one he turned into a 99-yard touchdown against Whittier 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Tellez, El Rancho, linebacker -- He was the best player on the Whitmont 
League champions, according to Coach Shelko. An outstanding hitter who overcame 
preseason knee surgery, Tellez had 115 tackles and, as a fullback, rushed for 
more than 500 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Vasquez, El Rancho, linebacker -- If Tellez did not bring down the ball 
carrier for the Dons, the wide-ranging Vasquez usually did. He had 97 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Jauregui, Bell Gardens, linebacker -- He set a Lancers record with 80 
tackles and also led the team in motivating. "He's a great linebacker," Coach 
Dave Newell said of this senior, who made the all-Whitmont League team. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Frausto, St. John Bosco, back -- A two-year starter, Frausto set a school 
record this season with eight interceptions and made the all-Angelus League 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Sethman, Whittier, back -- A junior, Sethman is a two-year, two-way 
starter who this season had 46 tackles and forced three fumbles. He was a 
unanimous choice for all-Whitmont League. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Jackson, Lynwood, back -- UCLA, Arizona, Washington and Oregon are 
recruiting Jackson, who had 31 tackles, 15 assists and two interceptions. As a 
running back, he gained 787 yards on 128 carries.
