OCEANSIDE SERVICE CUTS DRAW PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Nearly 500 people jammed into the Oceanside Civic Center to protest cuts in 
police and fire service, and, when the emotional meeting ended early Thursday, 
the City Council still couldn't decide what to do. 
</P>
<P>
So the council called another meeting for this afternoon in the face of 
mounting criticism of the city's plan to erase an expected $5.8-million budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The budget-balancing plan, among other things, calls for laying off 95 
part-time employees and not filling vacant jobs, grounding the two police 
helicopters, reassigning a fire engine company and reducing beach lifeguard 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 45 speakers who assailed the reductions, most spoke strongly on the 
city's 5-month-old helicopter program. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Rey Valley resident Barbara Smith told the council: "We want our 
helicopters back. I'm not sure it's a case of want or need." 
</P>
<P>
She said the helicopters are an essential tool of emergency response in the 
heavily developed valley, where traffic delays the arrival of police vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"That helicopter is a godsend to us in the valley," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Mildred Jenkins said the helicopters make her feel more secure at night. "There 
is nothing more comfortable to me than to look out my bedroom windows and see 
that helicopter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Several law enforcement officers also urged the council to save the 
helicopters, arguing that they guide and protect ground units in dangerous 
encounters. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't put a price tag on my safety," said Oceanside Police Officer Steve 
Regalado. "The helicopter is a tool that can fill the gap until we hire enough 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
Other speakers opposed the fire and lifeguard cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Alderson, representing the Oceanside Firefighters Assn., said removing one 
of the city's six engines from service and reassigning the crew to paramedic 
duty would hurt a fire department already stretched thin by city growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctrine of doing more with less has been tested in the extreme in this 
case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An Oceanside lifeguard, Tom Buckner, noted that city beaches are a summer mecca 
for North County residents, and that hundreds of rescues are made each year. 
Lifeguards, he said, "deserve the same consideration as other emergency 
services." 
</P>
<P>
After hours of protest that began Wednesday night and ended Thursday morning, 
the council was undecided on what action to take. Council members agreed to 
meet again at 2 p.m. today to review budget priorities and determine whether 
some public safety cuts would be restored. 
</P>
<P>
"It would seem we acted in haste," Councilman Sam Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Bagley said, "I would like to take a little more time and look at 
this situation." 
</P>
<P>
The projected deficit was caused by heavy city spending -- including for the 
two police helicopters -- a miscalculated beginning balance and dwindling 
revenue caused by the slow housing market and the recent deployment of 
thousands of Marines from nearby Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the city staff planned to lay off 87 temporary workers and leave 
jobs vacant, but that number has grown to 95.

PROMOTING TRAIN SAFETY IN WAKE OF DEATHS; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: SEMINAR HELD FOR THOSE WANTING TO SPREAD WORD ON RAIL HAZARDS 
AS HUSBANDS OF VICTIMS PLAN OWN CAMPAIGN. 
</P>

<P>
When it came right down to it, Lidia Mayers was there because of her son. And, 
because she never, ever wants to see him hit by a train and feel the grief of 
losing her little boy. 
</P>
<P>
The North County woman was among about 3 dozen volunteers -- including a former 
school bus driver, railroad museum workers, transit workers and several 
bilingual speakers -- who met at a Carlsbad hotel Thursday for the daylong 
seminar sponsored by a consortium of railroad officials and transit agencies 
throughout Southern California. They were there to learn how to teach others 
about train safety. 
</P>
<P>
And that evening, in a scenic canyon home in La Jolla, the husbands of two 
women killed last week in a Del Mar train accident held a safety meeting of 
their own -- to plan a grass-roots effort to stop trains in the North County 
from blasting their way through crowded passenger depots. 
</P>
<P>
Mayers said she was prompted to volunteer when her 7-year-old came home from 
school after the deaths last week of the two women who were crushed by a 
freight train just outside the Del Mar passenger depot. 
</P>
<P>
He had learned a difficult lesson that day. His teacher had read aloud from 
newspaper accounts of the tragedy. She described to the class how 47-year-old 
Usha Waney of La Jolla had slipped and fallen on the tracks as she ran to catch 
a train. 
</P>
<P>
And she read about how Roberta Halpern and her husband, Lee Kaiser, had tried 
in vain to pull the older woman from the rails -- to save a woman they didn't 
even know. Until the train came and took both women's lives. 
</P>
<P>
"He came home and said, 'Oh Mama! I learned something so sad today. Those two 
ladies died on the train tracks. And one of them was trying to save the other 
one!' " 
</P>
<P>
Lidia Mayers saw the fear in her son's eyes. So the 30-year-old North County 
Transit Service worker decided to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
She volunteered to participate in the "Operation Life Saver" program and go out 
to schools, offices and other public meetings to spread the crucial word about 
train safety. 
</P>
<P>
After a day of classes, officials say, the new instructors will be qualified to 
address the public about train right-of-way issues -- as well as hold classes 
for new instructors. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily, I've never witnessed a fatal train crash," said Pat Benner, a state 
bus instructor who volunteered for the program. "But I have seen too many fools 
drive around barriers with trains looming close. 
</P>
<P>
"It unnerves you to see just how close they get. I've got the experiences to 
put into words just how important it is to stay out of the way of those 
trains." 
</P>
<P>
The seminar is part of a three-pronged approach planned by Amtrak and Santa Fe 
Railroad officials, as well as various public transit groups and the Public 
Utilities Commission, to stem the tide of train-related deaths in the North 
County -- where six pedestrians have died since October. 
</P>
<P>
The other efforts include a study group investigating new enforcement efforts 
to keep people from ignoring safety signs and crossing signals. Another group 
will discuss engineering developments such as lighting and more frequent 
whistle-blowing to make trains more visable. 
</P>
<P>
In January, officials will also sponsor a public forum designed for people to 
ask questions and address concerns or fears that they might have concerning 
freight and passenger trains. 
</P>
<P>
"In nine years at my job, I've never seen anything like the spate of accidents 
we've had here in North San Diego County," said Sharon Greene, executive 
director of the multijurisdictional Los Angeles-San Diego Rail Corridor Agency, 
or LOSSAN. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to find a way to keep it from continuing in the future. Because, in 
the coming years, when more passenger, freight and local transit trains start 
running on those tracks, the potential for problems is only going to get 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the husbands of the two most recent train-accident victims 
have forged an unusual alliance through the pain of losing the women they loved 
to the same freight train. 
</P>
<P>
They plan to draft a letter to local railway officials, asking them to examine 
the speeds at which trains travel through the North County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like speed boats in the harbor," Hashu Waney said in an interview 
Thursday afternoon. "They're only allowed to go 5 miles an hour in the crowded 
waters for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I own a boat, and I don't like that rule one bit. But I follow it because 
there's a solid safety reason behind it -- so people don't get hurt. That's the 
approach we have to take here. There's no way train engineers should be allowed 
to run through a station at 55 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
Waney recalled meeting Kaiser for the first time last week at Roberta Halpern's 
funeral at a San Diego synagogue -- which he attended with his son, Naveen, and 
his late wife's sister. 
</P>
<P>
"I just stood there as he came into the room," said the 58-year-old clothing 
manufacturer. "He was crying. And he walked straight up to me, and we hugged. I 
whispered into his ear, 'I sympathize with you, Mr. Kaiser. We lost two very 
precious women.' " 
</P>
<P>
For Hashu Waney, the grief over his wife's death is turning into a driven 
resolve to make trains less deadly in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, Waney said, his grief turned to disbelief. For the first 
time, he returned to the Del Mar depot where his wife was killed. 
</P>
<P>
To his satisfaction, he saw that the owner of an adjacent parking lot had built 
a small fence to block the path Usha Waney had followed when she dashed toward 
the tracks last Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
But, as he knelt to lay a wreath of flowers on the spot his wife was killed, he 
spotted a woman carrying both a baby and large suitcase as she crossed the 
tracks only a few feet to the south -- at the spot where the new fence ended. 
</P>
<P>
"I was speechless," Waney said. "Nothing seems to stop them from crossing. 
That's why Mr. Kaiser and I are going to try and collect all the supporters we 
can to stand behind us. We want the railroad to act in two or three days, not 
months or years." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Greene says she can sympathize with the pain both husbands are feeling. 
But there are a few things about trains they and many people just don't 
understand, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to be on the bureaucratic side in a tragedy like this," she 
said. "Many times, I've formulated notes I'd like to send to such families, but 
I've held back because it might not have been appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"But, in this case, they should not have been there. It's not just a matter of 
crossing the tracks. They were there knowing that a train was approaching in 
less than a minute. That's the kind of thing we have to stop." 
</P>
<P>
And slower trains, she says, are no less deadly. 
</P>
<P>
"Statistics even show that slower trains are even more dangerous," Greene said, 
"because people are fooled into believing they can outrun them." 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's safety seminar, new instructors were coached on the difference 
between being safe and being irresponsible around trains. 
</P>
<P>
They learned eye-opening tidbits about how trains work. For example, while it 
takes an automobile traveling at 55 m.p.h. about 200 feet to stop, a train 
cruising at the same speed will take 1 mile to come to rest. 
</P>
<P>
They also learned that a train can crush an automobile with the same ease that 
a car could crush an aluminum soda can. 
</P>
<P>
One group of volunteers circled around a large colorful chart as an instructor 
coached them on broaching matters of life and death with children. "You say 
things like, 'You'd better be able to run 60 miles and hour, or you're in 
trouble,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And what happens when you can't run that fast?" 
</P>
<P>
Greene and others stressed Thursday that education is not the only key to 
ensure that these tragedies don't continue. 
</P>
<P>
The enforcement task force will study whether stiffer fines for people who 
ignore crossing signals are needed -- like the $246 fine levied against 
motorists who use freeway lanes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When people do things like drive around a crossing bar, they're apparently not 
thinking they could get killed," Greene said. "Maybe they'll give it a second 
thought if the chance exists they could be fined $246." 
</P>
<P>
LOSSAN will also seek federal funds to elevate or lower train tracks at 92 
street-level crossings between Los Angeles and San Diego -- roughly half of 
which are in San Diego County, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The $736-million "grade separation" project along 128 miles of tracks is 
expected to take 10 to 20 years to complete and would make the rail line like a 
freeway -- a route where intersecting roads go either below or above it. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, LOSSAN completed a study of safety measures and educational programs 
taken at 31 rail agencies nationwide, looking for new clues to stop the 
pedestrian carnage. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the study were to be presented to local officials late Thursday at a 
meeting of the North County Transit Board in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
One outcome of the study, Greene said, was the continuing development of a 
bilingual warning symbol to be placed along the tracks by next year -- a sign 
bearing the shadow of a locomotive bearing down upon a pedestrian walking the 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
But the survey did not point a clear direction in an issue that has recently 
loomed large in North County: whether tracks should be fenced off. 
</P>
<P>
"The norm of the agencies we looked at was not to fence," Greene said. "The 
idea is that fencing is redundant. The railroad tracks by themselves should be 
a signal not to trespass." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the fencing issue will not, necessarily, be decided soon, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"As the 1990s become the decade of rail service, that public policy issue will 
be one of increasing debate," she said. "But there will be no easy answers."

AFTER A LONG WAIT, MONUMENT IS DEDICATED AT MASSACRE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL BEN-ALI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Victoria Montemayor was a 17-year-old manager trainee in 1984 when police 
barred her from entering the San Ysidro McDonald's where she worked. Inside, a 
gunman was killing her co-workers and their customers. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Montemayor, now 24, brushed the tears from her cheeks as she moved 
her camera through a crowd of 200 people gathered outside a satellite campus of 
Southwestern College for the dedication of a long-awaited monument to the 
slain. A student journalist at the college, Montemayor was assigned to cover 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
After the negative publicity the massacre generated, she and others said, it 
was important that something positive follow the tragedy for which so many 
people remember San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
The memorial "means a lot, it really does," Montemayor said. "Even though it's 
taken them a long time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
On July 18, 1984, James Oliver Huberty walked into the restaurant screaming, 
"I'm going to kill you all!" and sprayed the room and parking lot with gunfire. 
Before he was slain by a police sharpshooter, Huberty had killed 21 people and 
wounded 19. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant was razed soon afterward, and the one-building satellite of 
Southwestern College was opened on the site three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the speeches, refreshments and choir music from Our Lady of Mt. Carmel 
Elementary School, sadness for the slain and a sense of accomplishment were 
expressed by residents and students. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors and their relatives struggled with the city of San Diego and the 
owner of the McDonald's franchise over compensation and medical and psychiatric 
treatment relating to the incident, as well as use of the site for a memorial. 
</P>
<P>
The $50,000 monument, which lies directly in front of the college branch, 
consists of 21 hexagonal white marble pillars linked in rows forming a pyramid, 
with a plaque bearing the victims' names. It was designed by Roberto Valdes, 
22, of Mexico City, a former architecture student at Southwestern, and paid for 
through private fund-raising and donations. 
</P>
<P>
"The 21 hexagons represent each person that died," Valdes said. "And they are 
different heights, representing the variety of ages and races of the people 
involved in the massacre. They are bonded together in the hopes that the 
community, in a tragedy like this, will stick together, like they did." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Leon, 25, who was a senior in high school at the time of the massacre, 
cut a business class at Southwestern to attend the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
"You forget about things like" the massacre, he said, "and we need little 
reminders to say, 'Hey, this happened,' and to just bow down your head and pay 
respect to the people and to know what this is here for."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: HUMAN ERROR PUT AN END TO THE SHORT LIFE OF RILEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ready for a real downer at Christmastime? Read on. 
</P>
<P>
Each year at the La Jolla Christmas Parade, the county Department of Animal 
Control brings a couple of dozen dogs that are up for adoption. The dogs are 
said to be "marching for their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Florence Lambert adopted an Irish wolfhound named Mickey from 
the parade. Lambert, a retired nurse, belongs to Friends of County Animal 
Shelters, or FOCAS. 
</P>
<P>
This year she was chairwoman of a FOCAS bake sale held in connection with the 
parade. She spotted a 10-month-old Australian shepherd puppy named Riley. 
</P>
<P>
Riley was not among the 18 dogs adopted that Sunday. He put up a fuss when a 
handler tried to put him into a cage. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost as if he knew what would happen to him if he wasn't adopted," 
Lambert said. "I couldn't stand it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
An Animal Control employee started to fill out the forms so Lambert could adopt 
Riley. But a paperwork hitch arose. 
</P>
<P>
A deal was struck: Riley would be returned to the San Diego shelter and Lambert 
would get him the following Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Lambert called the shelter. To her horror, she learned that Riley 
had been put to death on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to let that little guy die in vain," said Lambert, her voice 
breaking. She wrote county officials in protest. 
</P>
<P>
Animal Control Director Sally Hazzard said Riley was mistakenly put to death 
because an employee didn't put enough information in the computer to keep him 
off the "euthanasia list." 
</P>
<P>
The employee was disciplined, along with two employees who handle the 
euthanasia chores, Hazzard said. She declined to specify the kind of 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that, last year, Animal Control was forced to destroy 26,000 
unadopted animals. She said mistakes like the one that killed Riley happen once 
or twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
"All we can do is offer sympathy and an apology," Hazzard said. "It's 
devastating to all of us."

D.A. CLEARS OFFICER IN CHICANO PARK SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County district attorney's office has determined that a San Diego 
police officer was justified in shooting at a man who allegedly took part in a 
drive-by shooting aimed at the officer's car. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen, Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller 
cleared Sgt. Adolfo Gonzales of any fault in the shooting, which took place 
July 22 at Chicano Park. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred after Gonzales, a detective in the Police Department's 
gang unit, was notified that someone had been shot at the park. He went to the 
hospital to interview the victim and, on his way back, at about 3:30 a.m., 
picked up his wife, a police dispatcher, from work, then stopped at the park to 
see where the shooting had occurred, Miller's letter says. 
</P>
<P>
At the park, he left his car to look for the site while his wife, who was five 
months pregnant, waited in the vehicle. Gonzales heard gunfire and saw a pickup 
with two people in the back driving by his car and the occupants firing at it, 
the letter says. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales pulled out his gun and fired two rounds, but the truck left the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were arrested in September, and one, Guillermo Yanez, told police 
he had been shot at by Gonzales that night. One of the bullets grazed his 
thigh, but did not penetrate his pants, he told police. Yanez was charged with 
attempted murder and firing into an occupied vehicle and is scheduled to go to 
trial Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said Officer Gonzales was justified in the shooting because California 
law says that a law enforcement officer has the right to use deadly force "when 
he reasonably believes that force is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
"By firing at Sgt. Gonzalez's car with his wife sitting in it, the people in

NORTH ISLAND WORKER LAYOFF PROPOSAL PLAYED DOWN BY OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Officials downplayed a Pentagon proposal Thursday to cut costs by shutting down 
the Naval Aviation Depot at North Island Naval Air Station, which would force 
the layoff of 4,500 civilian employees. 
</P>
<P>
A report in the San Diego Tribune warning of the possible loss of 4,500 jobs 
caused "much concern" Thursday, said local Navy spokesman Mike Hammond, who 
added that the announcement was premature. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, an aide to Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) said the option to 
close the depot "is absolutely the least likely to be implemented." 
</P>
<P>
Both Hammond and Hunter aide John Palafoutas said the proposal is part of a 
broader Pentagon plan being considered to cut military spending. Pentagon 
officials are expected to announce the cuts next month, said Palafoutas. 
</P>
<P>
A wide variety of options is being considered, but the chance of the depot 
being closed is slim, he added. The option involving North Island would have 
Navy planes flown to the Air Force's Logistic Center in Sacramento for 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Defense is spending $25 million to upgrade the facility at 
North Island to accommodate nuclear carriers and the 90 to 100 planes they 
carry. It doesn't make sense to take the Navy planes and fly them all the way 
to Sacramento," Palafoutas said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that Pentagon officials have assured Hunter there is nothing to worry 
about. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got 4,500 employees asking, 'What am I going to get in my stocking for 
Christmas?' We're saying that it's not going to be a cold Christmas," said 
Palafoutas. 
</P>
<P>
He said another option being studied is combining a similar facility at Alameda 
in the Bay Area with North Island, and turning the depot here into a hub for 
some ships and planes of the Pacific fleet.

TRI-CITY BOARD MEMBER BLASTS HOSPITAL TRUSTEES; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: PANEL BLAMED FOR EXODUS OF STAFF AND CRITICIZED FOR CHOICE OF NEW 
LEADER AT OCEANSIDE FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Tri-City Medical Center board member criticized fellow trustees Thursday, 
calling them "dinosaurs who have outlived their usefulness" and who have caused 
an exodus of top administrators from the Oceanside hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Margret Merlock, an eight-year Tri-City board member, said she usually does not 
speak out against the board majority with whom she often disagrees, "but I feel 
that they have been negligent and need to wake up and see what is happening to 
their hospital. A lot of hospitals have been closed because of considerably 
less difficulties than we face at Tri-City." 
</P>
<P>
She blamed fellow board members for the resignation of five top hospital 
administrators in the past year and labeled as "cronyism" the hiring of a 
former hospital controller as chief executive officer, replacing the popular 
but controversial Richard Hachten, who resigned last month. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Gene Geil defended the selection of Leon Hooper, 55, as a coup 
for Tri-City administrators because the man "stood head and shoulders above" 
two other individuals who applied for the job, and because he was the only one 
available to assume the duties before Hachten leaves Tri-City Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Hooper, who had served as the Oceanside hospital's controller from 1965 to 
1970, retired in August, 1989, as regional vice president for HEALTHTRUST Inc., 
a firm operating 104 medical centers throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"He came to me recently and asked if there was an opening at Tri-City," Geil 
said. "He tried retirement, and he hated it. He has always had a warm spot in 
his heart for this area." 
</P>
<P>
Geil told Merlock and other critics of the 3-2 board decision to hire Hooper 
that the new administrator was "a fine choice, and I've been told that Scripps 
(hospitals, Tri-City's competitors in the North County) had him at the top of 
their list." 
</P>
<P>
But, after the bad publicity that followed the board's split decision to hire 
Hooper, Geil said: "He hasn't signed his contract yet, and, after all that's 
been in the newspapers, I wouldn't blame him if he doesn't sign it." 
</P>
<P>
Hooper has been offered the $145,000-a-year job for one year, Geil said. An 
option in the contract allows either Hooper or the hospital board to cancel the 
contract on 90 days notice. 
</P>
<P>
Merlock, however, questioned Hooper's educational credentials, pointing out 
that the administrator has a bachelor's degree in education and only a 
certificate in hospital administration, "which is something you can get after a 
six-week course." 
</P>
<P>
She said that Hooper was hired during an executive session of the board Tuesday 
night "after about half an hour's discussion and without checking his 
credentials. I wouldn't hire a gardener without checking his credentials." 
</P>
<P>
"This man (Hooper) has nothing to lose. He has a guaranteed one-year contract," 
Merlock said. She favored hiring a search firm that would bring in a temporary 
management team to run the hospital until the new executive was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
If a management team were brought in, she said, "they would do a good job, or 
they would never get another referral."

HIGH SCHOOL NEWSPAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a high school senior and editor of Santa Barbara High School's newspaper, 
the Forge, I was interested to read of the financial demise of numerous Los 
Angeles-area high school newspapers. The problems faced by these high school 
publications are disturbing and sad. 
</P>
<P>
As school districts across the state face the fact that budgets need to be 
reduced, high school papers are an easy target for cuts. Our school district is 
no exception, and as a result the Forge's staff and adviser have been forced to 
look in new directions for the money we need to print our paper. Thanks to a 
combination of hard work by the students and concern on the part of the 
school's administration, we are able to publish an eight-page issue every other 
week. It isn't easy to acquire the money we need, but involving the entire 
staff in fund-raising is an important part of the process. Every student is 
required to call potential advertisers and collect the money from these ads. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma of apathy among the student body is perhaps even more worthy of the 
attention of school administrations than budget woes. Journalism is exciting 
and educational, and the experience of working as a team to accomplish a common 
goal may well be as important as learning how to write a lead or put text in 
columns.

NO ETHICS COST MONEY, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are very few exercises of representative government more brutal than 
coping with a budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians engaged in the process like to talk about the necessity of "setting 
priorities." What they don't like to talk about is how those priorities get 
set. Sometimes, it has something to do with the merits of the outlay; at least 
as often, it has everything to do with the strength of the constituency for the 
expenditure at issue. Whatever the program, the stronger and more influential 
its constituency, the less likely it is to endure a crippling cut. 
</P>
<P>
That may not always be good economics, but it is pretty good democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles is struggling to come to grips with one of the worst 
budget deficits in memory -- an estimated $120-million shortfall. As a 
consequence, Mayor Tom Bradley has imposed an emergency citywide freeze on 
hiring. 
</P>
<P>
One of the victims of that order is the new city Ethics Commission, which is 
attempting to assemble the staff it will need to enforce the progressive, new 
governmental regulations enacted by the people of Los Angeles when they 
approved Measure H in last June's election. 
</P>
<P>
Those reforms hold the key to curbing the excessive influence of special 
interests over City Hall's lawmaking process and to eliminating the conflicts 
of interest that have plagued the latest Bradley Administration with scandal. 
That promise will go unrealized, however, if the Ethics Commission is denied 
the staff it needs to enforce the law that takes effect next month. 
</P>
<P>
Some in city government already have attempted to argue that every dollar spent 
on the Ethics Commission is a dollar that will not be spent on police, fire or 
other vital services. 
</P>
<P>
This false juxtaposition, which was the centerpiece of the anti-Measure H 
campaign, is as empty and silly now as it was last June, when the voters 
rejected it. Even in these tough times, there is money both for safe streets 
and honest government. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians who want to delude themselves into believing there is no popular 
constituency for ethical city government can get a bracing dose of reality by 
reviewing the results of last June's election.

The picture on the front page (Dec. 6) of Secretary of State James Baker with 
scowling face and pointing finger says it all.

Baker is from Texas and obviously is trying to play the role of top gunslinger. 
The Persian Gulf crisis, however, should not be treated like a shoot-out on the 
plains. America and the world need more than a cowboy in the saddle. We need a

Baker and others explain that their disagreement with former high military and 
government officials about the Iraqi situation is due to those former 
officials' lack of current detailed knowledge which he and a few other 
Administration officials possess. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest a straightforward way for the Administration to test this idea -- and 
convince many doubting citizens that our present course is the correct one. 
</P>
<P>
Let Baker, (Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman) Colin Powell, (Secretary of 
Defense) Dick Cheney and (national security adviser) Brent Scowcroft meet 
privately with these former officials and bring them up to date on the latest 
information. Then the now well-informed dissenters can again go before the 
congressional committees and correct their previous statements.

HIGH SCHOOL NEWSPAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on high school publications (Metro, Nov. 29) casts a light on a 
growing problem facing many public high schools across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
I am editor of the Beverly Hills High School publication Highlights, which is 
one of the few remaining weekly newspapers around. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly's paper has existed for several decades and has always been funded 
generously by the school district. 
</P>
<P>
However, we, too, are beginning to feel the effects of a financial crunch, 
especially since the defeat of a parcel tax initiative last June. Not only have 
high school newspapers traditionally served as trademarks and symbols of pride, 
but they also breed very bright and talented journalists, many who will someday 
face the essential responsibility of running the media. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper writing has been one of the most educational and fulfilling 
opportunities for me. I exercise my writing ability on the paper much more than 
in any academic class. It is a shame to think what a few more decades hold in 
store for the future of high school newspapers and the experience these 
students will miss.

GIVE CONGRESS HORSE RACES, NOT DISTRACTED LAME DUCKS; 
</P>
<P>
TERM LIMITS: THE PROBLEM IS TOO LITTLE COMPETITION, NOT TOO MUCH LONGEVITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK BLITZ, Mark Blitz is vice president for programs and director of 
political and social studies at the Hudson Institute.

<TEXT>
<P>
Many Americans, apparently including President Bush, believe Congress functions 
poorly. Paradoxically, members of Congress are reelected at astonishingly high 
rates (96.2% of the House in 1990). A movement has arisen, therefore, that aims 
to limit constitutionally the number of terms an individual can serve. A 
majority of the American public, the very people whose votes give members of 
Congress permanent tenure, support the movement's goal. 
</P>
<P>
The movement, now supported by the President -- he favors a 12-year limit -- is 
unhealthy. Constitutional amendments are often dangerous because their 
consequences are unpredictable: Even good ones add to the bad habit of treating 
basic political structures as mere inconveniences to be challenged whenever 
they give temporary irritation. We should not seriously consider amendments 
unless they address a deep and evident need that we cannot meet through 
ordinary political action. 
</P>
<P>
What issue does a limitation on service address? That members of Congress today 
have been serving too long? Is long service a problem in itself? Length brings 
experience with all its benefits. It is not obvious that these benefits are 
simply outweighed by increased possibilities for lethargy and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
What, then, is the real problem? In part, we fear that our congressional 
representatives are not really being elected at all -- not that they are being 
elected too often. Increasing evidence suggests that the advantages of 
incumbency are so formidable that we have little choice during elections. The 
problem is too little competition, not too much longevity, and the potential 
arrogance resulting from job security that even a civil servant would envy. 
</P>
<P>
How should we increase competition for congressional seats? A number of answers 
are evident. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Campaign finance reform must become reality. Reforms would reduce the 
effects of narrowly focused and irresponsible political-action committees and 
increase the influence of parties and local residents. The opportunity to fight 
elections through a sensible combination of principled debate and local 
interest would be increased. 
</P>
<P>
 -- We should pay more attention to the way the states propose to "redistrict" 
following this year's census. Fewer gerrymandered congressional districts might 
have a salutary effect on congressional competition and honest representation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Congress could substantially reform its franking privilege, a device that 
peppers constituents with thousands of pieces of propaganda thinly disguised as 
information. There was much talk of this last year but the franking budget 
remains too large. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finally, if Congress could discipline itself by following serious rules for 
debate and legislation, considering all measures and amendments through open 
discussions and reduce its staff, our legislators would be forced to rely more 
on their own wit, judgment and principles. This would also allow citizens to 
see what their representatives are really made of and stand for. The 
opportunities for choice and competition would increase; so would opportunities 
for thoughtful legislation. 
</P>
<P>
A term-limitation amendment would do little to increase electoral competition 
but would have several harmful consequences. One is that the number of lame 
ducks would increase. Would lame-duck senators or representatives be more 
attentive or less? More likely to be principled, or more likely to be 
eccentric? More ready to serve the community from which they come, or more 
eager to serve the interest by whom they wish to be employed? No one can say 
with confidence. Why risk an unpredictable change in congressional action to 
meet a problem that can be dealt with without constitutional change? 
</P>
<P>
More certain is the harmful effect that such an amendment would have on 
Washington's power structure. In a government where experience often translates 
into dominance, most neophyte congressmen would be at the mercy of experienced 
staff. In fact, congressional staff members would not be the only unelected 
officials to benefit from this amendment; bureaucrats would also rush in where 
members of Congress were ill-equipped to tread. The result, in short, would be 
that almost everyone in Washington with the desire to exercise more power would 
be better able to do so -- except, of course, those elected for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Another unwelcome consequence of this amendment would be unnecessary 
restriction of democratic choice. American political institutions are based on 
the principle of consent, and consent in large part means choice in the voting 
booth. Choice, indeed, is often, and properly, "structured" (that is, 
restricted), as through the Electoral College. This is done to encourage 
citizens to choose wisely. But how would this amendment make American voters 
more responsible? 
</P>
<P>
An amendment of this sort also restricts democratic choice in a more subtle 
way, by making a career of public service less attractive. Men of potential 
public excellence -- the "men of parts" who were predisposed not to enter our 
public life, as Toqueville observed -- might be even less likely to enter if 
their opportunity for achievement and renown were curtailed. Our goal, after 
all, is to elect wise men and women.

CHOICE ABOUNDS, LET NETWORKS BACK IN; 
</P>
<P>
THE RULE LIMITING OWNERSHIP OF SHOWS BY THE BIG THREE CREATES A PROTECTED 
MARKET FOR A HANDFUL OF PRODUCERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. SAMUELSON, Robert J. Samuelson writes about economic issues from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American television has lots of vices, but too few viewing choices is not one 
of them. We've got three major networks, and a fourth (Fox) is emerging. Nearly 
two-thirds of American homes get cable TV. If you don't like any of that, you 
can pop a cassette into your VCR. The idea that most Americans remain prisoners 
of the three major networks is laughably outdated. 
</P>
<P>
What's weird, then, is that we're still punishing the networks for power they 
lost long ago. In 1970, the Federal Communications Commission prohibited ABC, 
CBS and NBC from owning most prime-time entertainment programs (such as 
"Roseanne") and from selling the programs abroad or for reruns on local 
stations. The idea was to spur new programming sources and to prevent the 
networks from denying reruns to independent stations. With today's diversity, 
the restrictions are unwarranted. The FCC is reviewing the rule and should 
repeal it. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, the rule's beneficiaries object. They're mainly independent TV 
producers and the eight large Hollywood studios, which produce or have a stake 
in 75% of prime-time shows. The FCC rule gives them a protected market for 
network programs. So this is a megabuck quarrel. 
</P>
<P>
Consider "The Cosby Show." Its syndication rights for off-network reruns were 
sold for nearly $800 million, estimates Paul Kagan Associates, a media research 
firm. The producers, not NBC -- the network that runs Cosby -- got rich, and 
General Electric, NBC's owner, is livid. 
</P>
<P>
But there's more to this dispute than money. The basic competition in 
television today pits over-the-air broadcasting against cable. The FCC 
penalizes over-the-air broadcasting by lowering its profitability. The less 
profitable the networks, the less they can pay for top-flight entertainment 
programs, movies and sports events. Over time, more good programming will move 
to cable. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no sense handicapping the networks," says Henry Geller, a respected 
communications expert in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1970 and 1989, the networks' share of the prime-time audience dropped 
from 90% to 64%. In the same period, the number of independent stations jumped 
from 90 to 339, creating -- along with cable -- another big market for TV 
programs. Many hits now don't come from the major networks: for example, "The 
Simpsons" (on Fox) or Arsenio Hall's evening talk show. 
</P>
<P>
If the FCC dropped its rule, the networks would own and produce more prime-time 
entertainment programs (news and sports aren't covered by the rule). So what? 
Hollywood's complaint is that diversity and creativity would suffer. This 
argument rings hollow. Fox can now legally produce all its programs because it 
isn't covered by the FCC's rule. Still, Fox produces only about 40% of its 
programs. Its biggest hit ("Married with Children") comes from an outside 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
Without diverse programming, the networks won't get enough good ideas to hold 
on to their shrinking audiences. Every year, the networks introduce new series. 
Most flop. Failures are expensive, but the few successes are blockbusters. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the best writers and producers will always be well-rewarded. Yet 
independent producers -- who often collaborate with major studios -- say that a 
change in the FCC rule will hurt them by putting them at the networks' mercy. 
Maybe. But a rule change might also help by triggering a bidding war between 
studios and networks for creative talent. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the FCC's job to determine whether an independent producer makes $2 
million or $200 million. Nor should the FCC protect the major studios, which 
are increasingly foreign-owned. 
</P>
<P>
Changing the FCC rule wouldn't create better TV. Mostly, it would re-divide the 
economic pie. Repeal would increase the value of the networks. Some big network 
investors might sell and reap a windfall. But that's no argument for inaction. 
Everyone's greedy in this dispute, and no one's greed is morally superior to 
anyone else's. 
</P>
<P>
You can argue that the FCC's rule succeeded in fostering competition (more 
independent stations) or that it was overtaken by new technologies (cable and 
VCRs). No matter. All it does now is create protected markets and undermine 
over-the-air TV. It deserves a quick burial.

A PROFILE OF COURAGE

By The following is excerpted from a letter Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), 
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, sent to editors of several 
major U.S. newspapers, including The Times:

<TEXT>

One of the most interesting things about the budget package was the way the 
vote broke. Members who have served more than 12 years in Congress -- the usual 
deadline suggested by those who back term limitations -- voted strongly in 
favor, with nearly 60% voting for passage. 
</P>
<P>
Members with less than six terms voted narrowly against the conference report. 
More than two-thirds of the freshmen were in opposition. Those who had served 
five terms opposed by a nearly equal margin. 
</P>
<P>
Had Congress been limited to junior members, there's a reasonable chance we 
still wouldn't have a budget in place. I say this not because I'm a curmudgeon, 
but rather because I've seen a process work here whereby members become more 
courageous as they become more established and secure in their districts. I'm 
confident today's junior members will be much more willing to take the tough 
votes in another six or eight years. 
</P>
<P>
When we have problems in Washington, it is usually because we lack the 
political will to get the job done. What we need is an environment that 
nurtures and demands that will.

POLICE SAY GUN IN KILLING DONATED UNINTENTIONALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MONICA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police have determined that the gun used in the accidental shooting death of a 
Salvation Army employee belonged to an El Cajon couple who inadvertently 
included the weapon in a box of clothes they donated to the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bob Lein of the El Cajon police said the owner of the gun was found by 
checking receipt records that were kept where the goods were dropped off. 
</P>
<P>
Lein, who did not disclose the name of the gun's owners, said the couple never 
knew the gun had gone with the rest of the items that were donated, and that 
they had not intended to give the gun away. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the couple did not notice that the gun was missing until they were 
contacted by police. No charges against them are expected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place at the collection trailer in the parking lot of 
Kaelin's Market on Main Street in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that Connie (C.W.) Wayne Overby, 51, shot James Irwin Brower, 61, 
of Alpine after receiving a batch of donated items. Overby was going to show 
Brower the .22-caliber Derringer when he tripped on a piece of furniture, 
causing him to fall and inadvertently pull the trigger, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Pinzon, community relations spokesman for the Salvation Army Adult 
Rehabilitation Center, said Brower is survived by his wife Janet, and two sons; 
James Lee Brower, 33, and John Robert Brower, 31. He also had two 
grandchildren, Colette Tannouri, 9, and Christine Brower, 2. 
</P>
<P>
Brower was originally from Brooklyn, and was a civil servant repairing roads on 
Long Island. After retiring, he moved to California and began working as a 
supervisor with the Salvation Army, Pinzon said. 
</P>
<P>
Pinzon said Brower had planned to retire from the Salvation Army next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy had come on (the job) a little less than a year, but he was quick to 
make friends," Pinzon said. "He had a great sense of humor and always had a 
smile on his face. . . . He was an outstanding gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
Pinzon said his organization appreciates the people who make contributions, but 
said he hopes people will use caution when making donations.

SPARTANS WIN ON SHOT AT BUZZER 
</P>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Smith had the right touch, the right position and the right timing 
Thursday night at Cincinnati, leading No. 21 Michigan State to a 65-63 victory 
over Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Smith scored 34 points, the last two on a controversial offensive rebound at 
the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans (3-2) trailed by 15 points at halftime before Smith, who is 
averaging 27 points, took charge. 
</P>
<P>
He scored 22 points in the second half, including Michigan State's final nine, 
and was in the right place to rebound Mark Montgomery's missed shot at the 
buzzer for the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
The officials huddled before deciding Smith's layup had beaten the buzzer, even 
though a TV replay indicated it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati (3-3) took a 40-25 lead at halftime before Smith took charge. 
</P>
<P>
Smith made a jump shot to tie it at 63-63 with four seconds left. Montgomery 
stole an in-bounds pass and missed a three-point attempt, but Smith was in 
position to follow the miss with a layup. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>

Byron Houston and John Potter scored 19 points apiece and Oklahoma State used a 
big second-half run to beat Louisiana Tech, 89-58, at Stillwater, Okla. The

HALL OF FAME VOTE NO POPULARITY CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the new names on the 1991 Hall of Fame ballot being considered by 
baseball writers is that of Rod Carew. 
</P>
<P>
Carew's candidacy will not create the furor expected to accompany that of Pete 
Rose in 1992, but there probably will be a disturbing number of reporters 
withholding their vote for Carew because of what seem to be suspect reasons. 
Namely: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He didn't drive in runs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He wasn't always cordial to the media. 
</P>
<P>
Shame, shame. 
</P>
<P>
Carew is bona fide Hall of Famer. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the opinions of two of his former managers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bill Rigney: "There's no doubt in my mind he was a Hall of Fame hitter. I 
mean, there haven't been too many hitters since (World War II) who handled the 
bat better. He was simply one of the purest hitters I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gene Mauch: "There'd have to be some seriously irrational thinking not to 
make him a unanimous choice. Nobody can make a case against Rodney. Who's done 
what he's done?" 
</P>
<P>
Consider the statistics: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He won seven American League batting championships, a total surpassed only 
by Ty Cobb, who won 12, and Honus Wagner, who won eight titles in the National 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He hit .350 or more four times, collected 200 hits or more four times and 
had 3,053 career hits, 12th on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His 19-year average of .328 is 28th on the all-time list. He also stole 20 
or more bases seven times and, starting in 1975 with the Minnesota Twins, drove 
in 340 runs in a four-year span, including 100 in 1977, when he batted third 
most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he primarily batted first or second with the Twins and Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not too many guys who hit first or second and drive in a lot of runs," 
said Mauch, who managed Carew in both Minnesota and Anaheim. "The year I batted 
him third, he had a hundred." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rigney, who managed Carew in Minnesota: "He started off hitting ahead of 
guys like Harmon Killebrew and Bob Allison and later Tony Oliva, and I'm sure 
he felt that his job was to set the table. He set it for a lot of big hitters, 
and nobody did it better. 
</P>
<P>
"The one year when he broke his leg (1970, when he was limited to 51 games), he 
hit about .380 for several weeks before that, and I've never seen anyone hit 
the ball so hard so often. He was the best hitter I've ever seen in that 
period. There's no telling what he would have hit that year." 
</P>
<P>
He hit .366 in that abbreviated season, challenged .400 before finishing at 
.388 in 1977 and challenged .400 again during the first half of 1980 before 
finishing at .331. He twice hit 14 home runs in a season, but was more of a 
slashing, contact-type hitter, a description Mauch called an 
oversimplification. 
</P>
<P>
"Put it this way: The man could hit, period," Mauch said. "There was the Ted 
Williams style and it was one of a kind; the Stan Musial style and it was one 
of a kind and the Rodney Carew style and it was one of a kind, too. 
</P>
<P>
"He could have hit for more power. He was strong as a horse, but that's like 
saying Johnny Mize could have hit .400. I always had the feeling that if he 
hadn't been hitting 40 and 50 home runs a season, Mize could have gotten a 
single any time he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Carew now operates a batting school in the Anaheim Hills area. His 
craftsmanship has prompted several major league clubs to try hiring him as an 
instructor. The most recent offer came from the Twins and the Oakland 
Athletics, but he has opted to remain at home, working with younger players. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that there were times when he seemed to overreact to the printed 
word, allowing his pride and sensitivity to disrupt a working relationship with 
reporters covering his club, but the Hall of Fame isn't based on the number of 
interviews given. 
</P>
<P>
It's hits, not snits, that count. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the free-agent signings and potential signings, none seems more 
disquieting than the possibility of Bob Welch leaving the Athletics for the 
Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, San Francisco Giants or Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Welch was a good pitcher before he got to Oakland and will probably 
continue to be if he leaves, but he flowered with the A's, winning a 
career-high 17 games in 1988, matching it in '89 and then winning 27 games and 
the American League Cy Young Award in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
He may choose to stay, but his strange silence on the subject and his 
apparently serious interest in moving seem to imply a disturbing failure to 
recognize what the A's have meant to him. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, there's the Coliseum itself, with its forgiving distances and 
vast foul territory. Welch has a record of 36-8 there. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the consistent quality of the A's defense and the productivity of 
the offense. Welch has a 61-23 regular-season record with the A's, who averaged 
5.03 runs in his 35 starts last season. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, for a pitcher who seldom finishes what he starts, a bullpen that 
includes Dennis Eckersley and Rick Honeycutt represents the most secure of 
security blankets. Welch completed only two of those 35 starts in 1990, both 
shutouts. Of his 27 victories, Eckersley saved 19 and Honeycutt one. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there's the impact of pitching coach Dave Duncan, who provided Welch 
with a forkball, enhancing his repertoire and a philosophy of one pitch at a 
time, helping Welch control his often disruptive emotions on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Welch can survive without any of that, but can he be as successful as he was in 
1990? That's doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 players granted free agency as part of the collusion settlement, Dave 
Henderson has re-signed with the A's, and Jack Clark, formerly of the San Diego 
Padres, is said to be close to signing with the Red Sox, for whom he will share 
first base and designated hitter duties with rookie Mo Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
That arrangement would make first baseman Carlos Quintana expendable, and he 
has been offered to the Baltimore Orioles for pitcher Pete Harnisch. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles also reportedly are weighing a Minnesota offer of pitcher Mark 
Guthrie and first-base prospect Paul Sorrento for third baseman Craig 
Worthington, a measure of the Twins' disinterest and/or disbelief that they can 
retain third baseman Gary Gaetti, a new-look free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Among the numerous ways to measure the owners' winter spending spree is this: 
The Milwaukee Brewers, in the wake of signing free agents Ted Higuera, Franklin 
Stubbs and Edwin Nunez, have 10 players under contract with a 1991 commitment 
of $17.83 million. The Brewers' total payroll last season was $18.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a source of great concern," owner Bud Selig said of the continuing 
escalation. "It's frightening everyone in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Selig has been a leading advocate of revenue sharing and is expected to be a 
member of the joint study commission that will be announced next week.

PORTLAND THWARTED BY KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Portland Trail Blazers were on their way toward the best start in NBA 
history, Coach Rick Adelman had one major concern. 
</P>
<P>
He knew his team, closing in on the record 23-1 start of the 1969-70 champion 
New York Knicks, would be ready to play any of the top teams. 
</P>
<P>
What he was afraid of was a letdown against a weak team. 
</P>
<P>
His worst fears were realized Thursday night at Sacramento. The Kings, with the 
worst record in the league, fought from a 19-point deficit to beat Portland, 
100-88. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers, runaway leaders of the Pacific Division, had won eight in a 
row, were 19-1 overall and 8-0 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Antoine Carr and Wayman Tisdale led the King surge, which cut a 38-19 deficit 
to 53-47 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"Go ahead and say it," Tisdale said. "The worst team in the NBA beat the best 
team in the NBA. We've been coming back on a lot of good teams lately. 
</P>
<P>
"When we saw the look on their faces, we kept going. And when we saw the look 
in their eyes, we took it to them." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dick Motta wasn't around to see his club's finest hour and only their 
fourth victory in 19 games. He was ejected for drawing his second technical 
foul late in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"My getting tossed wasn't as big a factor as Leon Wood coming in and giving us 
a spark, or Lionel Simmons helping him at the guard line to allow us to go to 
(Anthony) Bonner," Motta said. 
</P>
<P>
Bonner, playing only his second NBA game, scored six of his 16 points in an 8-0 
start of the second half that put Sacramento in front, 54-53. Bonner broke a 
leg in October and played his first game Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-3 run over five minutes gave the Kings a 91-77 advantage with 2:37 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 141, Denver 126 -- Karl Malone scored 39 points and Jeff Malone had 29 at 
Salt Lake City as the Jazz waited until late in the third quarter to break the 
game open. 
</P>
<P>
With 3:40 left in the third quarter, Utah led, 94-88. But John Stockton scored 
eight points in a 17-10 run that finished the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Woolridge led Denver with 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 125, Orlando 114 -- The Magic held an 81-71 lead with 4 1/2 minutes 
left in the third quarter at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, though, had a little magic of their own in Kevin Johnson. Johnson, 
who scored 26 of his 38 points in the second half, stepped up the tempo and the 
Suns blistered Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix closed out the quarter, 16-4, to take the lead. Johnson scored 15 
points in the fourth quarter and the rout was under way. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 129, Seattle 106 -- After falling behind, 55-50, in a sluggish 
first half at Oakland, the Warriors got on track in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Hardaway, who scored 11 of his 17 points in the burst, led a blistering 
fast break that overwhelmed the SuperSonics in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 7 1/2 minutes of the quarter, the Warriors outscored Seattle, 
25-4. 
</P>
<P>
Although reserves played most of the last quarter, the Warriors scored 79 
points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 106, New Jersey 97 -- The Hawk fortunes began to change for the better 
soon after they replaced aging center Moses Malone in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year veteran never complained when Jon Koncak moved ahead of him. And 
Malone has shown a willingness to come off the bench and lend a hand. 
</P>
<P>
Malone and another veteran, Sidney Moncrief, came to the rescue in the fourth 
quarter at Atlanta to drive the Hawks to their fifth victory in the last six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Both Malone and Moncrief contributed eight points to the late surge that 
clinched the victory. In 20 minutes, Malone had 15 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
New York 87, Minnesota 76 -- John MacLeod is just getting acquainted with the 
Knicks and he is beginning to like what he sees. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Oakley had 22 points and 17 rebounds at Minneapolis to lead the Knicks 
their second victory in a row under their new coach. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the way Charles Oakley used to destroy us at Phoenix and Dallas," 
MacLeod said. "It's sure nice to have him play that way for me." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing had 31 points and 15 rebounds for New York. DAN HAFNER

BOURQUE, JANNEY LEAD BRUIN WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
The Hartford Whalers waited until the last period of their back-to-back series 
with the Boston Bruins to make a move and by then it was much too late. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Ray Bourque and center Craig Janney had four assists Thursday night 
at Boston as the Bruins completed a sweep of the series, 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
There had been bad blood between the teams since two games in late November in 
which there was fighting and dangerous stick-swinging. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins won Wednesday night at Hartford, Conn., 5-1, in a contest devoid of 
any untoward incidents. There were two calm periods Thursday, in which Boston 
built a 6-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Tempers flared in the last period. There were several brawls, high-sticking and 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
The sweep strengthened the Bruin lead in the Adams Division to five points over 
Montreal and 10 points over the Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 5, Quebec 2 -- Nordique goalie Ron Tugnutt saved 42 shots and kept 
Quebec in striking distance until Brent Fedyk and Bobby Dollas scored in the 
final period to help the Red Wings to their second consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Nordiques had won two consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
While the Red Wings peppered Tugnutt, Quebec fired only 17 shots at Detroit 
goalie Tim Cheveldae, including only four in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Minnesota 2 -- The Blues spotted the North Stars an early two-goal 
lead at St. Louis, before Brett Hull went to work. 
</P>
<P>
The NHL's leading goal scorer tallied his 30th, then set up two of the three 
Blues' goals in the third period that stretched their unbeaten streak to four 
(3-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
Bob Bassen scored two of the goals for St. Louis, which became the fourth team 
to reach 40 points this season. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 5, Winnipeg 4 -- The Blackhawks spotted the Jets three goals in the 
first period at Chicago but battled back to victory. Troy Murray and linemate 
Dirk Graham scored two minutes apart in the last period to get the victory, the 
20th for rookie Ed Balfour. He is the first to win that many this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks (22-10-2) lead the Norris Division by six points. Their 46 
points are the most of any team in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 9, New Jersey 5 -- There have never been any doubts about their 
ability to score. It's just that the Penguins have to score so many to win. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't sure of ending their four-game winless streak at Pittsburgh until 
Paul Coffey and Kevin Stevens scored early in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave up five goals in 37 shots, goalie Wendell Young won for the 
first time in five appearances. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 2, Philadelphia 2 -- Randy Wood scored with eight minutes 
left in regulation at Philadelphia to get the Islanders a tie. DAN HAFNER

Write or Wrong?: Even though sex and drug charges against gonzo journalist 
Hunter Thompson were dropped earlier this year in Aspen, Colo., some still love 
him and others fear and loathe him. Says Sheriff Robert Braudis: "I just hope 
this place doesn't become so uptight that he feels he has to move away."

<P>
But newsman Bill Dunaway says: "People take him with a large grain of salt."

Four in One: One of Buckingham Palace's art galleries was transformed Wednesday 
into a ballroom when Queen Elizabeth II invited 800 guests to celebrate four 
royal birthdays. The ball marked the 90th birthday of the Queen Mother on Aug. 
4, the 60th birthday of the queen's sister, Princess Margaret, on Aug. 21, the 
40th birthday of the queen's daughter, Princess Anne, on Aug. 15, and the 30th 
birthday of the queen's second son, Prince Andrew, on Feb. 19.

Of Note: Two handwritten letters between Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein 
discussing the nature of war sold for $165,000 at an auction by Sotheby's in 
New York. Einstein's four-page letter of July 28, 1932, asks: "Is there a way 
to liberate man from the doom of war?" Freud's reply concludes: "There is no 
prospect of getting rid of this aggressive instinct."

HOT TO SHOP: A LESS THAN SUBTLE GRIP FOR GLASSES 
</P>

THERE'S A LOBSTER ON YOUR GLASSES! 
</P>
<P>
You'd think that the notion of snakes or spiders or lobsters crawling down your 
chest to keep you from losing your glasses would have little appeal beyond the 
"Tales From the Crypt" crowd. But we hear that skiers, older women and 
teen-agers are wearing Subtles Eyeglass Cords, which employ a variety of creepy 
creatures to help you hang onto your glasses. 
</P>
<P>
"They're also a hit with pediatricians and schoolteachers because children 
adore them," says Susan Subtle, a Berkeley-based journalist who founded Subtle 
Corp. to market the eyeglass-minders featuring plush, soft-sculpture creatures 
or body parts. "Men are sort of hesitant to wear them, but there are some adult 
men walking around wearing them." 
</P>
<P>
The cords come in 10 different styles (snakes, lobsters, whales, spiders, 
leopards, ducks, frogs, fish, alligators and human hands). The suggested retail 
price ranges from $15.50 to $19.50, depending on the species. The lobster cords 
(pictured) are $15.50 and are carried at Homeworks in Santa Monica, Folk Tree 
in Pasadena and Gallery Alexander in La Jolla. For more information, call the 
Subtle Corp., (415) 540-1057. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HOT: I'm fed up hearing about these bad experiences people have with store 
clerks. I've seen pleasant clerks be polite to customers who make Genghis Khan 
look like Mister Rogers. The good ones deserve some kind of recognition, but do 
I just thank them profusely and let it go at that? Call or write the manager? 
Recommend them for sainthood? 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HOT SHOPPER: Exceptional salesclerks should definitely get some 
well-deserved recognition, especially the geniuses who can find the perfect 
Little Black Dress that makes you look skinny even after you've overindulged in 
holiday cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Seriously, clerks who go out of their way to help you locate something at 
another store, in another department, or lend good advice on buying gifts or 
putting an outfit together, should be thanked. If you feel this person has gone 
above and beyond the call of duty, the best thing to do is to write the store 
manager. Include the clerk's name, the department and what he or she did that 
was so swell. This also goes for a salesperson you deal with often who is 
consistently polite and helpful. 
</P>
<P>
If you're short on time, you might mention it to the store manager while you're 
there, or do your praising through a brief phone call. 
</P>
<P>
WATCH OUT -- We wish we hadn't seen this but we thought you should know it's 
out there. It's a watch, designed for Nordstrom devotees, and its face says: 
"I'm a Nord-a-Holic . . . (and I love it)." 
</P>
<P>
The watch comes complete with instructions advising that if the wearer is found 
wandering in a mall, he or she is to be taken to a Nordstrom and given a credit 
card. 
</P>
<P>
There have been lots of shopaholic jokes (and we know that overspending is a 
serious disease for some). But we think this watch ranks too high in kitsch and 
too low in laughs to deserve two charge cards up from us. 
</P>
<P>
Should you appreciate the concept more than we do, the watch is available for 
$60 at some but not all Nordstrom stores. It may also be mail-ordered (for 
$49.95) from Political Time Co., P.O. Box 94, Huntington Beach, Calif. 92648. 
For more information, call (714) 969-8463.

Baubles, Boxers, Requisite Tie 
</P>
<P>
"Perfect." That's what Julia Roberts said when she saw the antique necklaces 
with watches, lockets and other Old World charms at Tracey Ross, a new shop in 
Los Angeles. She scooped up several of the pretty baubles priced from $200 to 
$300. Farrah Fawcett also cruised the store recently and purchased a pair of 
$20 flannel boxer shorts printed with playing cards and dice -- for herself. 
</P>
<P>
TIES? AGAIN? Need a present for the man on your list? How about a tie? The 
numbers indicate that it is the universal lack-of-imagination gift. The 
Neckwear Assn. of America estimates that between 14.4 and 19.2 million ties 
will be sold this holiday season. Even former First Father Ronald Reagan won't 
be spared. Daughter Maureen wrapped up her Christmas shopping at Fred Hayman 
Beverly Hills with a couple of tie purchases for dear old dad.

HEAVY TRAFFIC: Three rap masters, Young M.C., Vanilla Ice and M.C. Hammer, have 
been shopping at Traffic in the Beverly Center for their formal attire. Young 
M.C. bought a $1,200 rhinestone-encrusted tuxedo, and Vanilla Ice had to have a 
tux for his new video. M.C. Hammer opted for a more sedate, black silk Fugi 
suit.

STILL ON THE RISE: Joey Rodolfo recently received some surprising news from the 
California apparel industry. It seems the 12-year design veteran was a nominee 
for the California Mart's Rising Star menswear designer award, along with newer 
talents Mat Gaspers, June Hiroshima-Lentz, Sepp Donahower and Walter Muroya. 
"Isn't the rising star supposed to have pimples and be fresh out of design 
school?" Rodolfo asked Listen. Rodolfo created his first menswear line, under 
the Lifeguard label, in 1978. His new, Seattle-based collection of traditional 
menswear is called Cutter &amp; Buck. "I'm going to have to call the Mart and 
ask them to start a survivors award," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
HIDDEN CHARMS: Not all candles are created equal. Some carry buried trinkets. 
At Tops in Malibu the hot seller of the season is the Treasure Candle, 
available in an $18.50 and $30 size. As the pyramid-shaped candles melt, hidden 
charms -- anywhere from four to eight -- appear. The charms are made of such 
materials as sterling silver, rose quartz and jade. Michelle McIntosh, daughter 
of gallery owner Robert Walker, reports her grandmother, Jennifer Jones, found 
a jade frog in one. McIntosh says Pat Benatar, Mick Fleetwood, Whoopi Goldberg 
and Julie Andrews are among the celebrities who have bought the candles as 
Christmas gifts. Let's hope their friends have chopsticks, the recommended 
device for removing the bounty.

GULF CRISIS: AMBASSADOR HOWELL LEADS THE FINAL PLANELOAD OF U.S. CITIZENS TO 
SAFETY IN WEST. 'WE DID NOT CLOSE THE EMBASSY,' HE ASSERTS. 'THE FLAG FLIES.'

FRANKFURT, Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hostage saga for Americans in Iraq and Kuwait ended Thursday with the 
departure of W. Nathaniel Howell III, the U.S. ambassador to Kuwait who held 
out in his besieged embassy for nearly four months. 
</P>
<P>
"The flag flies" there still, Howell said when he arrived in Germany as part of 
the last planeload of Americans to come out of Iraq. The embassy compound, 
which he abandoned after 110 days of steadily dwindling food supplies and 
shortages of electricity and hot water, will remain technically open although 
unstaffed. 
</P>
<P>
Smiling and chewing gum, the ambassador told reporters at the Frankfurt airport 
that the 31 Americans on board the Iraqi Airways jetliner with him represented 
"all the Americans who wanted to leave Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy to be here," Howell said. "We're very delighted that all 
Americans who wanted to leave Kuwait did. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning, I closed the embassy," he began, then corrected himself: "We did 
not close the embassy, but vacated it. The flag flies." 
</P>
<P>
Howell declined to describe conditions in Kuwait. When asked how the embassy 
refugees managed to survive, the diplomat grinned broadly and said, "That's a 
secret." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, President Saddam Hussein 
declared the neighboring sheikdom his country's 19th province, and he ordered 
all foreign embassies there to close by Aug. 24. Most complied, eventually 
leaving only the British and Americans as holdouts. The British ambassador and 
his staff came out with the American diplomats Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
For the first three months of the crisis, the Americans in the embassy, 
determined to defy Iraq's orders to vacate, were denied supplies and lived on 
embassy food stocks -- eventually little but canned tuna -- and boiled water 
from their swimming pool. Early this month, the Iraqi occupation forces began 
allowing them small amounts of new provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Howell was accompanied by his deputy chief of mission, Barbara Bodine, his 
three other embassy aides and a number of Americans who had taken refuge inside 
the compound. Wearing a scraggly white beard and a bright green jacket, Howell 
appeared healthy. A U.S. Consulate spokesman, Craig Springer, said none of the 
returning Americans required medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
Before the takeoff from Baghdad, a U.S. Embassy spokesman there also had a 
succinct comment on Howell's condition: "He's a tough old dog." 
</P>
<P>
The Americans were part of a total of 94 passengers aboard the U.S.-chartered 
Boeing 707 that first flew from Baghdad to Kuwait city Thursday to pick up 
foreigners, returned to the Iraqi capital for more passengers, then departed 
for Germany. Also aboard were 25 Britons, 16 Canadians, nine Japanese and a 
scattering of other nationalities, according to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt said the Americans, including 
the five diplomats, would stay here overnight and fly to the United States 
today. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials in Baghdad say that no more charter flights of Americans are 
planned. About 500 U.S. citizens remain, mostly in Kuwait, and are not expected 
to request departure. Most of those left are spouses and children in Arab 
families and consider either Iraq or Kuwait their home. 
</P>
<P>
Although greeted by U.S. Ambassador to Germany Vernon A. Walters, Howell either 
eschewed or was not offered what might seem to be routine diplomatic 
courtesies. He waited in baggage claim along with the other passengers, then 
was escorted through the sprawling airport with shouting reporters trailing him 
up two flights of stairs to a drab chain hotel adjacent to the airport, where 
he was to spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
Howell stopped long enough to accept a "Free Kuwait" button from a Kuwaiti 
woman whose family of eight came to the airport clad in black sweat shirts to 
"thank the Americans" for supporting their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
The ambassador appeared to emerge as a hero to those who had shared the 
experience with him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a hero, like John Wayne," Jack Rinehart of Stover, Mo., one of those 
trapped in the embassy before his release, was quoted as saying by the 
Associated Press. "He drank the same dirty water; he slept outside with the 
flies and the heat." 
</P>
<P>
An Irishman with a cast on his leg was taken off the plane in a wheelchair, but 
his name and details about his injury were not immediately available. When 
asked how he was hurt, he laughed and said, "Celebrating!" as he was wheeled 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Howell's afternoon flight capped a week of emotional departures of hundreds of 
foreigners from Iraq and Kuwait. Many of the hostages -- including American, 
Japanese, British, Italian and French citizens -- had been held as so-called 
human shields at Iraqi military and industrial sites to deter a potential 
U.S.-led attack. Others floated in limbo in Baghdad or hid out in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, Iraqi President Hussein announced last week that he would 
release all foreigners, claiming that the purpose of their captivity had been 
served. He said the stay of the "guests," as he called them, gave Iraq time to 
build up its military forces to confront an expected invasion. 
</P>
<P>
According to Western and Arab diplomats, the visit of three of Iraq's Arab 
allies to Baghdad last week helped persuade Hussein to release the hostages. 
Jordan's King Hussein, Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat 
and Ali Salim Bidh, the vice president of Yemen, all spoke with the Iraqi 
leader and advised him that the hostages were more a cause for war than a 
deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, President Bush had indicated he was "tired" of the treatment of 
Americans in Iraq and Kuwait, raising speculation that the embassy drama might 
provide a spark to ignite a U.S. drive to push Iraq out of the sheikdom. 
</P>
<P>
During his recent visit to South America, Bush effectively reversed himself and 
indicated that the exit of hostages from Iraq and Kuwait could in fact free his 
hand for military moves. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, U.S. officials in Washington insist that the departure of Howell 
does not indicate acceptance of Iraq's annexation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Over the months, embassy after embassy in Kuwait shuttered as hardships mounted 
on diplomats who stayed behind. At one point, an East German official who 
ventured from his home looking for water was taken into custody and flown to 
Baghdad. Iraqi troops once stormed the French Embassy but declared the move a 
mistake and retreated. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate Howell's safe departure, American officials still in Baghdad held 
a champagne party Thursday and promised to take a day off. 
</P>

U.S. QUESTIONING MILLIONS IN STANFORD RESEARCH BILLS; 
</P>
<P>
INQUIRY: PROBERS SAY GOVERNMENT WAS CHARGED $2,000 A MONTH FOR FLOWERS. OTHER 
UNIVERSITIES FACE INVESTIGATION.

<P>
Stanford University has charged taxpayers $2,500 to refurbish a grand piano, 
$3,000 for a cedar-lined closet and $2,000 a month for flower arrangements at 
the official residence of the university's president, according to 
congressional investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The figures were discovered after federal auditors questioned millions of 
dollars that Stanford had billed the government for government-backed research 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Naval Research, which monitors payments to Stanford for all 
government research, said Thursday that a five-person team will be sent to Palo 
Alto to investigate allegations concerning the billing practices. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, faced with questions from the congressional investigators, Stanford 
disclosed that the university had repaid $184,286 that it had erroneously 
charged the government for depreciation on a 72-foot yacht, complete with 
Jacuzzi, as well as on other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional investigators now are sifting through thousands of vouchers at 
the university in preparation for a hearing early next year on the manner in 
which Stanford has billed the government for overhead costs associated with 
government research. 
</P>
<P>
"We have recently discovered a number of charges that have been absorbed by the 
government that neither I nor the taxpayers financing these costs would 
consider reasonable or proper," Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) said in a letter 
asking federal auditors to step up their examination of research overhead costs 
at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, compared the 
inquiry to the early stages of an investigation of billing practices in the 
defense industry. He indicated that similar questions may exist at other 
universities, and investigators said that Stanford is only the first of several 
schools that will come under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Horton, Stanford's associate vice president for public affairs, said that 
the university has followed proper guidelines in billing the government and 
provided auditors with what it believes are justifications for the figures 
challenged in audits. Negotiations over the charges are under way, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Horton said that Hoover House, the residence of university President Donald 
Kennedy, is owned by the school and used regularly for campus activities. He 
said that some costs associated with it can properly be allocated to research 
overhead. He said he is aware that costs associated with the piano, closet and 
flowers are under review but that no judgment has been made that they are 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
However, Horton acknowledged that the depreciation costs associated with the 
yacht were mistakenly passed on to the government and were repaid as soon as 
they were discovered. He said that the repayment does not actually involve 
returning money but rather that it offset future costs. 
</P>
<P>
The university has hired two Washington law firms to represent it in dealings 
with Dingell's subcommittee on oversight and investigations, which is leading 
the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was triggered by unrest among the Stanford faculty over the 
high overhead rate that the university charges the government for research and 
complaints from a government auditor. The professors were concerned that the 
rate might price them out of the market for some government projects. 
</P>
<P>
The rate is meant to cover indirect costs to the university associated with 
research, such as buildings, utilities, administration and libraries. 
Universities also add such items as tennis courts and faculty discounts for 
football tickets to the rate, contending that such costs are associated with 
persuading top people to work for them. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford charges the government 74 cents for every dollar the government spends 
on research at the school to cover those indirect costs, one of the highest 
rates in the nation. That means that the government must pay Stanford $1.74 
million for a $1-million research project. At Yale, the rate is 68% and at MIT 
it is 62%. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1989, Stanford was paid $241 million for government research, 
including overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators for Dingell and the General Accounting Office, an investigative 
arm of Congress, said they suspect that Stanford and other universities shift 
as much of their operating burden as possible to the government. 
</P>
<P>
For 1991, Stanford is seeking a rate of 78%. However, a federal audit completed 
in September and obtained by The Times said that only 61% appeared justified. A 
decrease in the rate would cost Stanford millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Riddle, Stanford's comptroller, said auditors have received additional 
documentation and he expects the full rate request to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Auditors have also raised questions in at least two recent audits about 
millions of dollars in library overhead costs that the university has billed to 
the government. For instance, the auditors have questioned $2.3 million in such 
costs that Stanford says should be paid by the government because it 
represented space and material used for research. The auditors have challenged 
the way the school calculates those costs, and that matter also is being 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
The yacht Victoria was donated to the school's sailing program in December, 
1987, and included in athletic department equipment. Depreciation costs on the 
equipment, including at least eight other boats and a prefabricated building, 
were charged to the government as part of overhead costs.

ALLEGED DRUG KINGPIN SEIZED IN SAN MARINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal drug agents on Thursday quietly arrested a San Marino resident 
described as one of the world's largest cocaine traffickers and successor to 
the "king" of the Bolivian cocaine trade. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Jorge Roca-Suarez, 38, at his 19-room house was confirmed by 
Julius C. Beretta, special agent in charge of the San Diego office of the U.S. 
Drug Enforcement Administration. Agents also arrested Roca's wife, Beatriz 
Roca-Torres, 40, in nearby Monterey Park, Beretta said. 
</P>
<P>
Both were being held on charges of conspiracy to possess cocaine with the 
intent to deliver, the agent said. 
</P>
<P>
Beretta would divulge no more about the arrests or the charges against the 
couple, saying only that Roca is a resident immigrant in this country and "one 
of the most significant cocaine traffickers in the United States, on par with a 
Medellin or Cali cartel leaders." 
</P>
<P>
One law enforcement source said the arrests stem from a federal indictment that 
is expected to be unsealed today. The source said the investigation rivals that 
of former Panama strongman Manuel Noriega, who is jailed in Miami while 
awaiting trial on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
Agents arrested Roca at his 5,000-square-foot brick home on a hillside in one 
of San Marino's most exclusive enclaves. By late afternoon, agents were still 
searching the house on Old Mill Road. 
</P>
<P>
Several children as well as a maid were being detained inside the house, agents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
DEA agents also served as many as 20 search warrants in San Marino, Alhambra, 
Pasadena and San Dimas, the source said. Roca's bank accounts were seized, and 
his properties searched. A house searched in San Dimas has 10,000 square feet 
of living space and was purchased by Roca for $2 million in cash, the source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Roca is from the northeastern Beni region of Bolivia and is known as "Techo de 
Paja (Straw Roof)" because of his blond hair. His arrest, sources said, is seen 
as a coup for the DEA because the agency will not need to go through the 
process of trying to extradite him from a foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
Roca is the nephew of Roberto Suarez Gomez, a DEA fugitive who is currently 
serving a 15-year sentence in Bolivia on drug charges. Suarez, the patriarch of 
a respected cattle-ranching family, became known in the 1970s and early 1980s 
as the ruler of Bolivia's biggest cocaine-trafficking empires and the "king of 
cocaine" in that South American country. Bolivian officials have refused U.S. 
requests for his extradition.

Roca reportedly grew up with his mother in Los Angeles and returned to Bolivia 
when he was about 20. He allegedly was one of his uncle's trusted lieutenants. 
He allegedly betrayed Suarez and now, according to law enforcement officials, 
rules the Bolivian cocaine trade along with a group of younger cocaine 
traffickers who provide tons of the drug for the U.S. and European drug 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
County property records indicate that "George and Cirila Roca" bought the San 
Marino home for $1.4 million in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Don Banderas, principal of San Marino High School, said Jorge Roca-Suarez told 
him he was in the real estate business. Roca's 17-year-old son enrolled in the 
school in September along with three other relatives, either siblings or 
cousins, the principal said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the average family income in San Marino is about $127,000, some of the 
Rocas' neighbors in the San Gabriel Valley city were struck by their apparent 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my neighbors did say he (had) too many fancy cars and stuff," said one 
woman who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor said that the family lived quietly and put a lot of work into 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting scary," said one woman who noted that the house is located half a 
block from the scene of a Feb. 5, 1988, shoot-out between DEA agents and a 
carload of Taiwanese drug suspects that left two agents and two suspects dead. 
"I think I'll move," she added, with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Bolivia is a significant cog in the international cocaine trade and provides a 
large proportion of the coca leaves and cocaine paste that are eventually 
refined into powdered and rock cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal drug trafficking in the country began in earnest in the 1970s under the 
tutelage of the Colombian traffickers. In his heyday, Roca's uncle, Suarez, 
lived and operated virtually with impunity. He once even offered to pay the 
Bolivian foreign debt -- an offer that the government rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian press once quoted him as bragging that he had $400 million and 40 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in 1988, however, and sent to a La Paz penitentiary. Soon 
after, then-U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz applauded the arrest as a 
"triumph of law enforcement" in the South American country. 
</P>
<P>
But DEA officials said Roca -- once a trusted lieutenant in the ring -- had 
already taken over the drug operation by dealing on his own with the Colombian 
drug cartels, supplying them with semi-refined cocaine paste at prices lower 
than those charged by his uncle. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1988, a DEA spokesman said Roca "knows we are investigating him, and 
he may be afraid of going back (to the United States) now." It was unknown when 
Roca returned.

12 TIJUANA SECT MEMBERS DIE IN A RELIGIOUS RITUAL 
</P>

<P>
Twelve people, including three children, were found dead Thursday inside a 
small house, apparently poisoned or asphyxiated during what authorities 
described as a nightlong religious ceremony gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
Five others, including a baby girl, were taken to a clinic, where three were 
reported in comas and listed in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the victims were all members of a religious sect headed by a 
charismatic Tijuana resident who was among those in a coma late Thursday. The 
sect leader was identified as Federico Padres Mejia or Mexia, who lived in the 
two-room house where the deaths occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Police had not determined a cause of death by late Thursday but continued to 
insist that neither mass murder nor suicide was to blame -- even though some 
family members feared otherwise. Instead, police speculated that the group 
either drank a fruit punch that was mistakenly tainted with an industrial 
solvent or were asphyxiated by a leaking butane tank. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest victim, according to police, was Fidel Coronel Franco, 77. The 
youngest victim was an 11-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
Autopsies and chemical tests on the food and drink found in the house are 
scheduled to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after regaining consciousness, a survivor, Alfredo Osuna Hernandez, 22, 
said the group was participating in a religious "cleansing" ritual. He said the 
ritual involved a coin and the possibility of "good luck." 
</P>
<P>
Osuna, a native of the state of Sinaloa who said he had been in Tijuana for 
four months, said he had hoped to find a job through the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The participants, he said, were told that it would be harmful to leave the 
rope-delineated circle in the front room. At about 9 p.m., he said, worshipers 
began to drink the punch. 
</P>
<P>
Soon thereafter, he said, there were shouts of distress. 
</P>
<P>
"They began to scream in pain," said Osuna, who had attended several previous 
sessions with the leader he knew as Don Federico. "They screamed in a very ugly 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Osuna said he only took a sip of the punch. He doesn't know what caused the 
illness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the session, he said, were his brother, Felipe, 23, and his 
sister-in-law, Margarita Ramos Saucedo. She was among those listed as dead. 
Felipe's condition was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The small, two-room house where the deaths occurred is located in a poor 
section of the El Florido barrio known as Mariano Matamoros on the city's 
southeastern outskirts. Police said neighbors there told them the sect began 
its praying ritual at about 6 p.m. Wednesday. Four hours later, Felipe Osuna 
Hernandez, 24, went to the house to check on his mother, Margarita Ramos Osuna, 
and his 5-month-old sister, Ana Karin, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't let him in. They told him Jesus Christ was about to come," Jose 
S. Camacho, one of the first policemen on the scene, said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime early that same evening, Ana Saviola Miranda Juarez, 19, the daughter 
of the woman who owns the house and who lived with Mejia, went to her mother's 
house. She found her mother, Gloria Miranda Juarez, and a group of people 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned an hour later, Mejia wouldn't let her in, she said. Mejia 
told her that a spiritual ritual had begun and that two men already were in a 
trance. She left and spent the night in a pickup truck outside the house. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after midnight, she said, "I heard them praying loudly and I heard a 
man scream that the devil was not going to exist anymore. I also heard Federico 
yelling, 'Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid!' 
</P>
<P>
"I could hear people crying and baying like dogs. It was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
The screaming stopped at about 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman tried to get into the house at about 7 a.m. Thursday but the 
doors and windows were locked, she said. A workman that her mother had hired 
came by and he broke a window and let the young woman in. 
</P>
<P>
"Right away, I smelled a strong order of gas," she said. The group appeared to 
be sleeping, she said, because she heard some of them snoring, and she thought 
the ritual was still going on. The baby girl was in her mother's arms, crying, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman and the workman left, but before they did, they drank from the 
punch, she said. Her mother was among those who died. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Miranda was held at the police station late Thursday and police 
were considering filing charges against her for failing to help the baby. 
</P>
<P>
At about 10 a.m., Osuna returned, looking for his mother. 
</P>
<P>
He looked in the window and saw bodies in the front room. His mother was among 
the dead, and his baby sister was in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
"I opened the door and they were all thrown about the floor and on chairs," 
said Camacho, the police officer. "They looked as if they were drunk. They 
looked like they were sleeping off a party." 
</P>
<P>
Another officer who was among the first to arrive, Arturo Luis Torres, said 
"inside the room there was a very strong smell of acid. It was so strong it 
almost caused me to be nauseated. I had to leave the room." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the front room of the adobe-colored house police found a thin rope 
knotted in several places and laid in a circle roughly bordering the 
circumference of the room. There was also a painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe 
on a cardboard box flanked by two candles. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Dec. 12, is Mexico's Fiesta of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a national 
religious holiday. Police, however, said they did not know whether the ritual 
had any connection to the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the victims were inside the circle, but they were not holding 
hands. Some had blood coming from their noses and others bore traces of vomit. 
There were no signs of violence, police said. Some of the victims reportedly 
had a purplish discoloration of the skin. 
</P>
<P>
In the kitchen, the only other room in the house, police found seven glasses 
with remnants of what authorities believe might be tainted punch. There was 
also a pot of chicken and salsa and another pot of rice soup. 
</P>
<P>
There were no drugs found in the house and all of the victims were fully 
clothed, police said. They found a handgun in one woman's purse. 
</P>
<P>
Police Cmdr. Jaime Sam Fierro said Mejia had lived in the house for several 
months with Gloria Mirada Juarez. 
</P>
<P>
He said Mejia claimed to be a spiritual leader who could contact the dead and 
cure the sick. The young Miranda woman said Mejia had been conducting rituals 
at the house daily for about a month. 
</P>
<P>
The rituals, she said, usually lasted two to three hours. 
</P>
<P>
She said Mejia spoke English well and claimed to have a temple in Los Angeles, 
where he also performed spiritual rituals. He also said he had a home in Sun 
City, she said. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor, Noeimi Gomez, 19, who lives across the road from the house, said 
she was awakened at about 2 a.m. Thursday morning by sect members knocking hard 
on the walls of the home. 
</P>
<P>
"He (the sect leader) and the others never bothered anybody," said Gomez.

LIMITING TERMS IN WASHINGTON; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: AFTER SUCCESS AT THE STATE LEVEL, MOVEMENT SUPPORTERS ARE STUDYING 
WHETHER TO SEEK A SIMILAR INITIATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S U.S. SENATORS AND 
REPRESENTATIVES.

Authors of the successful initiative limiting the terms of state elected 
officials said Thursday that they are considering a measure for the 1992 ballot 
that would impose similar limits on the state's U.S. senators and members of 
the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting at a well-attended national conference on the growing movement to limit 
terms, the chief backers of successful measures in three states said they hope 
California would join Colorado, which in November became the first state in the 
nation to slap limits on the terms of its elected federal representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone most assuredly will seek to place an initiative "limiting federal 
terms" on the California ballot in 1992 . . . as long as it has a reasonable 
chance of being sustained in court," said Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum, chief sponsor of Proposition 140, which imposed limits on California 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum said he is looking at sponsoring a measure that, like Colorado's, 
would limit U.S. representatives and senators from California to 12 years of 
service. Others here predicted that voters in as many as 20 states will get the 
chance in the next two years to restrict the length of service for their own 
congressional delegations. 
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by a group that is trying to export the term-limit 
movement nationwide, came two days after it was disclosed that President Bush 
will push for a constitutional amendment limiting congressional terms. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of term limits, such as Colorado state Sen. Terry Considine, said they 
doubt that members of Congress are ready to accept an amendment that would 
limit their terms. Instead, states that permit measures to be placed on the 
ballot by initiative will have to lead the way, said Considine, who wrote the 
Colorado initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of term limits for Congress face a key constitutional question over 
whether individual states can impose limits on their federal representatives. 
Considine said he expects a legal challenge to the Colorado initiative, which 
limits members of the House and the state's U.S. senators to 12 successive 
years in office. He acknowledged that the matter might be tied up in court for 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, it's a political question, not a legal question," Considine said. 
He argued that if voters in state after state endorse term limits, politicians 
will back a constitutional amendment. "If there's a consensus for term limits 
it will become the law." 
</P>
<P>
The group sponsoring the conference, Citizens for Congressional Reform, is 
hoping to get a federal term-limit initiative on the ballot in the remaining 22 
states that have the initiative process, said Michael Hinds, the group's 
director of field operations. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters made it clear that California, the nation's most populous state, 
will be a key state if backers are to succeed across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"If you all pass it in California in 1992, it's done," said Lloyd Noble II, an 
independent Oklahoma oil man who authored a successful measure limiting 
lifetime servicein that state's Legislature to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's reported endorsement of congressional term limits drew a mixed response 
Thursday. Some argued that the President's backing will give legitimacy to 
their cause; others contended that it could turn the matter into a partisan 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Because Democrats hold majorities in both the U.S. Senate and the House of 
Representatives, "more Democrats than Republicans will be dispossessed" by term 
limitations, said Lewis K. Uhler, the president of the National Tax Limitation 
Foundation and one of the authors of California's Proposition 140. But 
proponents insisted that theirs is a nonpartisan issue and Uhler and others 
contended that term limits are likely to mean fierce competition from both 
parties for vacated congressional seats. 
</P>
<P>
In California, Schabarum said he is bracing for an expected legal challenge to 
Proposition 140. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum announced that the nonprofit Pacific Legal Foundation would defend 
Proposition 140 against any challenge in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation attorney John Coupal said he was optimistic that Proposition 140 
would survive a court test. "I never want to use the term bulletproof," Coupal 
said, "but it gets about as close as you can get." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
California voters, by a margin of 242,000 votes out of more than 6.6 million 
cast, imposed limits on the terms of state legislators and statewide 
officeholders. The landmark Nov. 6 ballot measure limits Assembly members to 
six years in office and state senators and statewide officials to eight years. 
It also requires the Legislature to cut its operating budget by as much as 50% 
and eliminates lawmakers' pensions. President Bush this week announced his 
support for a constitutional amendment that would limit congressional terms.

3RD TEMPLE IS DEFACED IN HANUKKAH VANDALISM; 
</P>
<P>
ANTI-SEMITISM: A WORKER AT THE VENTURA SYNAGOGUE SCARES OFF A MAN 
SPRAY-PAINTING SLURS ON THE WALLS.

<P>
In the third attack on a Jewish temple this week, Temple Beth Torah in Ventura 
was defaced by a nocturnal vandal who spray-painted slurs linking Jews to the 
Antichrist. 
</P>
<P>
Maintenance manager Roque Sanchez, who lives on the grounds, said he was making 
rounds in his truck about 10 p.m. Wednesday when he scared off a man painting 
black letters on the temple school. 
</P>
<P>
"When I put on my bright lights, there he was writing on the walls," Sanchez 
said Thursday. The man scrawled "6 Points, 6 Sides and 6 Triangles" -- 
referring to the Jewish star of David -- before he fled, Sanchez said. The 
number 666 sometimes is associated with the Antichrist. 
</P>
<P>
The vandal may have been trying to write the same anti-Semitic slurs that were 
left on two Thousand Oaks synagogues on the eve of the eight-day Hanukkah 
celebration, law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Police Detective Jeff Killion, who investigates hate crimes directed 
against religious and ethnic minorities, said the attack on Temple Beth Torah 
may have been triggered by the Jewish holiday, which began Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just the kind of thing that stirs up people's hate," Killion said. 
</P>
<P>
Buildings at Temple Adat Elohim and Temple Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks were 
spray-painted with biblical citations from the New Testament depicting them as 
synagogues of Satan. 
</P>
<P>
Both synagogues were desecrated with the same phrase painted on Temple Beth 
Torah, the Jewish Star of David and the words "The Anti-Christ's Symbol." On 
Temple Etz Chaim, the vandal added the message, "Jews are Satan's Chosen." 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the vandal chose a dimly lighted area away from streets and 
parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Although the markings have since been erased on the two Thousand Oaks 
synagogues, they have left an indelible impression on Jewish leaders, who 
condemned such acts as hate crimes committed by racial bigots. 
</P>
<P>
After noting a similarity in the graffiti, Ventura County Sheriff's Detective 
Scott Miller contacted the Ventura Police Department on Thursday to get help in 
identifying the vandal. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura police may be helpful in identifying a suspect if he lives in Ventura 
but commits crimes in other parts of the county, Miller said. Miller also plans 
to interview known vandals in the Thousand Oaks area. 
</P>
<P>
"Very seldom do we get any suspect information at the scene," he said. "We have 
to work on the leads we have." 
</P>
<P>
It is the third time that Temple Beth Torah has been attacked this year. In 
March, bullets pierced a sign at the temple, and in July, a building was 
spray-painted with the letters "ZOG," a reference to Zionist Official 
Government, an anti-Semitic reference used by white supremacists, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
Temple Beth Torah workers said they were stunned to learn that their school was 
defaced. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really upset," secretary Nessa Memberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said he will leave the vandal's markings on the school until Sunday as 
a lesson for Jewish students who attend religious classes and others who will 
be at a special Hanukkah celebration that day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm leaving it until Sunday so they can see what's going on in the world," he 
said.

TOUGH SLEDDING FOR SANTA CLAUS; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: ST. NICK, ALIAS STEVE PORTER, IS LEARNING HOW TO HANDLE ADULTS 
WHOSE CHILDREN WANT NO PART OF THE MAN IN THE RED SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
You could fill a book with the things they never teach you at Santa Claus 
school, Steve Porter says. Such as how to handle rejection. 
</P>
<P>
Or more precisely, how to handle parents whose children want no part of a Santa 
Claus photo opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the biggest problem I have with parents," said Porter, who plays Santa 
Claus at The Oaks Mall in Thousand Oaks. "I despise these people who force a 
child who's terrified of Santa to sit up on his lap and then say, 'Smile.' " 
</P>
<P>
Of the dozens of preschool-age children who toddled up to Santa's throne 
Thursday morning, at least half screamed in protest, despite Porter's kindly 
reassurances and the threats, bribes and assorted enticements of camera-toting 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they know who Santa is," said Suzan Benson of Simi Valley, as 
son Michael and nephew Tyler Steele, both 1 year old, wailed in unison while 
struggling to escape Santa's arms. "They wonder, 'Who is this strange man?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Tyler was fine until Michael started crying," said Tyler's mother, Lisa 
Steele. 
</P>
<P>
For Grace Brown, a clerk at the Culpeppers Popcorn counter a few yards away, it 
was a familiar scene of laughter and lamentation. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell our kids not to talk to strangers, then we drag them to see Santa," 
Brown said. "I've heard parents threaten kids and bribe them. 'We'll go get a 
toy if you're good.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating for parents." Brown said. "They get the kids all dolled up 
and then they don't want to sit on Santa's lap. 
</P>
<P>
"But some of them really look forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
For most parents, recording their child's encounter with Santa is at least as 
important as the visit itself. Robin Nicastro, Santa's photographer at The 
Oaks, has a collection of stuffed animals, bells and funny faces designed to 
stop tears long enough for a quick photo. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids you can snap out of it," Nicastro said. "But some parents pressure 
their kids." 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes there's no telling what will happen. 
</P>
<P>
"He was OK until he got up there," said Jami Swayze, whose 1-year-old son Jesse 
-- actor Patrick Swayze's nephew -- sobbed on cue the minute he was placed in 
Santa's arms. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids wait in line and watch the other kids cry and think that's what 
they're supposed to do," Swayze added. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing the comments of several parents, Swayze said she dared not arrive home 
from the mall without photographs, no matter how Jesse felt about it. 
</P>
<P>
"His grandparents said that if I didn't get them, they were going to bring him 
down," said Swayze, who bought the top-of-the-line, six-photo package for 
$19.95. 
</P>
<P>
The reluctance of some children to sit in Santa's lap is one of many surprises 
that Porter has entered in a journal -- "The Santa Claus Chronicles" -- since 
he attended a two-day Santa school and started at the mall the day after 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
A novice St. Nick, the 35-year-old Porter says he never knew how hard it could 
be to ho-ho-ho all day in a hot costume and scratchy beard.

"The first thing Santa has to do is jet to the bathroom," he said as he doffed 
his red suit at the start of a 30-minute lunch break. Then he squeezed in a 
couple of cigarettes in a back room of the mall before fortifying himself for 
the afternoon crowd -- an older, more skeptical bunch -- with a chicken 
sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids challenge me," he said. "They say, 'You're not really Santa Claus.' 
I tell them that Santa needs lots of helpers." 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 rule for Santa Claus is not to make promises, Porter said. "I never 
promise anything, even if the parent says it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
So what do kids want this year? 
</P>
<P>
"For boys, anything to do with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," Porter said. "For 
girls, it's Barbie. I've had 10,000 requests for Barbie this, Barbie that." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the 47-year-old woman who climbed on Santa's lap and announced 
that she wanted Santa for Christmas. "She wanted to know when I got off work," 
said Porter, a divorced Newbury Park resident with two children of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his encounters with pushy parents and tearful children, Porter said the 
$7-an-hour job has gotten him into the Christmas spirit as never before. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, I've been burned out at Christmas," he said. "This year, I expect 
it to be the best Christmas ever."

GREENPEACE TO JOIN PROTEST OVER OIL-WASTE DUMP; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE ORGANIZATION WILL POST SIGNS ON HOUSES NEAR THE UNDERGROUND 
SITE. A FREE-SPEECH DEBATE MAY INTENSIFY. 
</P>

<P>
Greenpeace announced Thursday that it will enter the controversy surrounding an 
oil-waste dump, buried beneath an Oxnard subdivision, by posting protest signs 
on the roofs of houses in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the international group, best known for its Save the Whales 
campaign, said they will meet with residents of the Oxnard Dunes neighborhood 
on Saturday morning to post signs that read "Toxic Timebomb." 
</P>
<P>
The signs will be posted only with the consent of the property owners, 
Greenpeace representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
The protest tactic is significant because Lynda Paxton, an Oxnard Dunes 
resident, was cited for violating city ordinances last month after she painted 
protest signs on the side of her house and on the side of her fence. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Meddick, a Greenpeace spokeswoman, said she believes that the citation 
against Paxton violated her freedom-of-speech rights. City officials said the 
signs violated a city regulation that requires residents in that neighborhood 
to notify city officials before changing the color of a building. 
</P>
<P>
The signs will be posted on the roofs to bring attention to the oil-waste dump 
that was found in 1985 beneath the 100-parcel subdivision, Greenpeace officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The involvement of Greenpeace is the latest twist in the longstanding and 
controversial issue that in some instances has pitted neighbor against 
neighbor. While some residents vocally seek compensation for living above a 
waste dump, others would prefer to keep the matter quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Maggio, Oxnard's community development director, said Greenpeace might 
also run into trouble with the city if officials determine that the signs are 
permanent alterations to the houses. 
</P>
<P>
He said such signs require a city permit. Violators can be fined $100 for the 
first violation, $200 for the second and $500 for each additional violation, 
according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it all depends on what they put up," Maggio said, adding that he is 
aware that the matter raises questions about rights. 
</P>
<P>
"First Amendment rights are an issue, and that is why we are being careful 
about how we approach this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, 175 residents of Oxnard Dunes filed a $3.5-million lawsuit against 120 
defendants, including developers, real estate agents, oil companies, previous 
landowners and landfill operators. 
</P>
<P>
But state Department of Health Services officials announced last month that a 
five-year study found that the waste dump poses no health risk. 
</P>
<P>
Meddick said the protest on Saturday is also designed to bring attention to the 
state's report, which she said played down the health risks of living in Oxnard 
Dunes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Health Services said last spring that 40 different toxic 
chemicals had been identified at the site, that levels of contamination in soil 
samples were 'unacceptable,' and that the toxics were leaching into an 
underground aquifer," she said in a statement. "Yet for some reason, the final 
report says the dump 'no longer presents a hazard to health at current levels.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Although state health officials acknowledge that the chemicals in the soil 
appeared harmful at first, they said further studies found that the chemicals, 
such as cancer-causing chrysene, were at such low levels that they posed no 
health risk. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, state officials formally presented the study to a group of 
about 20 property owners and residents at South Oxnard Center. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Mercanet, who owns a corner lot in the Oxnard Dunes with her husband, 
said she thought the crowd was sparse because those involved in the lawsuit may 
be disappointed with the state's positive report. She said she and her husband 
plan to build a house on their lot if the land proves to be safe. 
</P>
<P>
Some property owners said they attended the meeting to confirm their beliefs 
that the oil beneath their property is not dangerous. Oxnard Dunes apartment 
owner Bob Gilbert, for example, said he has never found evidence of a problem 
in digging as deep as eight feet to install fences on his property. "Every 
place should be as safe as that," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace's decision to intervene in the Oxnard Dunes matter is not the first 
time the group has taken up an issue in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Last year it criticized the way that Waste Management of North America operates 
landfills elsewhere in the country. The company, which is planning to open a 
landfill near Weldon Canyon, rejected Greenpeace's criticism as unfounded.

<P>
The Ventura County Superior Court judge presiding over the case of a man 
charged with slaying an 8-year-old boy ordered his courtroom closed to the 
public Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Behind closed doors, attorneys discussed a possible conflict of interest with 
the public defender's office representing Gregory Scott Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Steven Z. Perren's order cleared the courtroom of all but the attorneys, 
himself and a court stenographer. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 23, of Canoga Park was scheduled to be tried Jan. 8 on charges of 
murder, kidnaping and arson in the March 23 death of Paul Bailly of Northridge. 
Prosecutors have alleged that Smith abducted Paul from a day-care center at the 
Darby Avenue Elementary School, gagged him with duct tape and strangled him, 
then set the body afire in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection was to continue Monday, but Perren said he would postpone it 
until Jan. 8 and put off the trial so he could spend Monday handling the 
matters that he discussed privately with attorneys this week. MACK REED

Pleasant Valley Elementary School District trustees approved a controversial 
set of history and social science textbooks Thursday for use during the next 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
The books, published by Houghton Mifflin, incorporate geography, archeology, 
language, the arts and other areas for students in kindergarten through eighth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
The texts introduce a new method of teaching history by including information 
on non-Western and non-European cultures. 
</P>
<P>
The books were approved for use in October by the State Board of Education, but 
not before they were criticized as being insensitive to Latinos, blacks, Jews, 
Muslims and gays. Houghton Mifflin made enough changes to get the state's 
approval. Several school districts in Ventura County are considering using the 
textbooks and have had the books and supporting materials on display for public 
review since late November. 
</P>
<P>
The Pleasant Valley School District will spend $132,778 of its state textbook 
money to purchase the texts. KAREN McKEAN

STUDENTS PRESS SANTA CLARITA CITY OFFICIALS ON MALLS, MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget growth and traffic congestion. A girl at Skyblue Mesa Elementary School 
wanted Santa Clarita City Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy to answer a question of 
major importance to the city's youth: 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know when they're going to start building that mall?" 
</P>
<P>
When Darcy, speaking at a school assembly Thursday, replied that construction 
on the city's first mall was scheduled to begin in 1991, a clutch of girls let 
out an appreciative "ooooh." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Darcy had found a happy group of constituents. 
</P>
<P>
Malls, bike trails and video arcades were just some of the topics covered as 
Darcy and Councilwoman Jill Klajic met with about 100 upbeat and curious 
students as part of a monthlong celebration of the city's third anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
The aim was to give the fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders a first-hand look at 
the history and workings of a city that isn't much older than they are. As it 
turned out, the exchange revealed more about the eager interrogators than Santa 
Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you get paid good money?" one boy asked. 
</P>
<P>
About $600 a month, Darcy replied. 
</P>
<P>
Oh. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you rich?" a student asked Klajic. 
</P>
<P>
Klajic laughed and said no, being on the City Council doesn't mean you're rich. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not rich either," Darcy added. 
</P>
<P>
But the students had more than money on their minds. Derwin Maxwell, 10, wanted 
to know if Darcy had ever received a letter from the President. (She met 
President Bush when he dedicated a prison in Castaic.) Josh Temple, 10, asked 
what Darcy liked about being mayor. Timothy Latta asked Darcy for her 
autograph. 
</P>
<P>
Klajic and Darcy said some questions showed a surprisingly good grasp of local 
affairs. Candi Friend, 10, sounded like a veteran slow-growth activist when she 
asked suspiciously, "I hear they were going to make some condos by the bike 
path." 
</P>
<P>
The condos in question were part of the ill-fated Santa Catarina project, the 
most controversial issue to face the City Council in Santa Clarita's brief 
history. The proposal was squashed under an avalanche of public protest last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
When Darcy realized Friend was referring to Santa Catarina, she just smiled. "I 
don't think so," she said deadpan. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Skyblue, along with youngsters from the Wiley Canyon and Sulphur 
Springs elementary schools, also drew Santa Clarita birthday cards, which are 
on display at City Hall. John Wasiel of Wiley Canyon penned a reassuring 
message to accompany a drawing of Bart Simpson: 
</P>
<P>
"Happy 3rd Santa Clarita. Don't have a cow man. You're only 3."

WESTLAKE VILLAGE OKS HOUSING PROJECT FOR WILDLIFE HABITAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Westlake Village City Council has cleared the way for a developer to build 
51 houses in an area described as important wildlife habitat, but complained 
that a state parks agency should have bought the land to preserve it. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly four hours of testimony and discussion Wednesday night and early 
Thursday, the council voted 5 to 0 to approve plans by M.J. Brock for a 
development on an oak-studded meadow upstream from Lake Eleanor, which 
environmentalists call an important water source for animals in the Santa 
Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Council members expressed regret over allowing development on the land, but 
said they had no choice because of the absence of an offer from the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy to buy the land. 
</P>
<P>
The land had been described by biologist Rudi Mattoni of the Center for the 
Conservation of Biodiversity, a Beverly Hills environmental group, as a "really 
unique property . . . a truly rich area of bio-diversity." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lynch, a representative of M.J. Brock, said the developer is willing to 
sell the land, but no agency has stepped forward to negotiate for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very disappointed in some of the agencies," Councilman James Emmons said. 
"Their mission is to acquire open space land and it would have been good if 
they had in fact acquired this site." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Berniece Bennett questioned whether officials of the conservancy 
-- a state agency charged with the preservation of the Santa Monica Mountains 
-- truly considered the site ecologically significant. "If it was that 
sensitive, I wish they had come forward to buy it," she said. "That's why they 
have the funds." 
</P>
<P>
But conservancy officials later said the agency -- now involved in complicated 
negotiations to acquire a controversial, expensive canyon in Studio City -- 
doesn't have the money. 
</P>
<P>
"The conservancy can't buy everything," spokesman Paul Edelman said. "People 
seem to have this illusion that the conservancy has this endless source of 
money, but that's not the reality." 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing Wednesday night, Edelman appealed to the council to reject the 
construction proposal on grounds that the potential benefits of the new houses 
are not adequate compensation for the environmental damage they would cause. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed construction site is home to a large population of tiny yellow 
flowers, known as Pentachaeta lyonii, which are on the federal government's 
list of endangered species. Many of the flowers, which are indigenous to the 
Santa Monica Mountains, will be destroyed by the housing, project opponents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The project also calls for uprooting 11 oak trees, although seven would be 
transplanted. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists also complained that runoff from the development will pollute 
the lake, and that the residences will block a canyon wildlife trail, making it 
difficult for animals from the mountains to reach the water. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stoddard, who has lived in Westlake Village 16 years, contested the 
conclusion of an environmental impact report that significant environmental 
damage on the site is "unavoidable." 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought that only death and taxes were unavoidable. I guess now we 
have to add the destruction of our environment," he said. "But the truth is, it 
is avoidable. Simply by not approving this project, you can avoid it." 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Ken Rufener said the landowner's property rights take precedence over 
the environmental concerns because the land is zoned for residential 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe that an acre or two of land on which a small flower grows is 
enough to justify depriving a property owner the right to build on his land," 
he said.

DEUKMEJIAN LOOKS AHEAD TO QUIET LIFE BACK IN HIS OLD NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even before he officially gives up his job next month, Gov. George Deukmejian 
is packing his bags to return home to his quiet seaside neighborhood in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Once he's home, Republican Deukmejian will be able to drop by his favorite 
Belmont Shore barbershop, listen to a Sunday sermon at All Saints Episcopal 
Church or maybe even savor a sunset without being distracted by the state 
budget crisis or political tiffs with Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to being able to have a little more privacy, a little more 
freedom and some new challenges," Deukmejian said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gore, Deukmejian's press secretary, said the governor is exploring 
several career options, including joining a law firm or a corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's friends say the 62-year-old governor may face an immediate 
adjustment in giving up the trappings of power. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to have people picking him up and driving him to the airport," 
said Al Taucher, a Long Beach resident whom Deukmejian appointed to the State 
Fish and Game Commission. "But I don't imagine he'll miss all the controversy." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, after eight years as leader of the nation's most populous state, a 
smiling Deukmejian chuckled in a recent interview that he expects to slide into 
private life in Long Beach "very easily, very easily." 
</P>
<P>
"That's our home," he said. "Our family is there, and our friends are there." 
</P>
<P>
His three grown children were reared in Long Beach. Deukmejian said he and his 
wife, Gloria, are looking forward to leading a less public life. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the Deukmejians are having their Long Beach house painted. They plan 
to settle in before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's ties to Long Beach are deep. Deukmejian, who was born in a village 
on the outskirts of Albany, N.Y., settled in Long Beach in 1958, practicing law 
and getting involved in community affairs, which served as his springboard to 
politics. Among other things, Deukmejian was active in the Lions Club, 
Community Chest and the Boy Scouts. In 1959, he was Long Beach Man of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejians' homecoming and transition into private life is expected to be 
far easier -- and far less chronicled -- than their highly publicized search 
eight years ago for a place to live in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
After his election, Deukmejian sought permission from the Legislature to live 
in the $1.5-million suburban governor's mansion, which former Gov. Edmund G. 
Brown Jr. had refused to use. But the Democratic-controlled Legislature, miffed 
at the governor for varied reasons, dragged its feet and allowed the mansion to 
be sold. 
</P>
<P>
While waiting for a decision, Deukmejian initially lived in the downtown 
Holiday Inn before moving into a high-rise apartment building six blocks from 
the Capitol. He lived in the apartment for about 17 months, commuting to his 
Long Beach home on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the governor said he would find his own housing. His supporters bought 
a home for the Deukmejians in the Wilhaggin area, a 15-minute drive from the 
Capitol, and leased it to the state. A spokeswoman for Deukmejian said 
Gov.-elect Pete Wilson, who will be sworn into office Jan. 7, is expected to 
move into the 3,200-square-foot Wilhaggin home. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their bumpy landing in Sacramento, Gloria Deukmejian said she has 
"enjoyed it up here, but I think it's time to return" to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
One state official, who asked not to be identified, said he was surprised that 
Deukmejian was returning to Long Beach, citing his longtime ties to the 
capital. Before his 1982 election as governor, Deukmejian served in the 
Legislature for 16 years and as attorney general for another four. 
</P>
<P>
"Long Beach might be billed as his hometown, but he has more friends in 
Sacramento," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian's friends in the seaside community embrace the governor as one 
of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. William Thompson, rector of All Saints Episcopal Church, voiced 
happiness that the governor is coming back and hopes that he will be as "active 
in the congregation as he was before he was elected attorney general." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, a Deukmejian appointee to the Board of Behaviorial Science Examiners, 
said the governor "has never struck me as the kind of man who will sit back and 
twiddle his thumbs and do nothing. He'll be involved in something."

L.A. CHARGES ASBESTOS VIOLATIONS AT 3 DEMOLITION SITES; 
</P>
<P>
AIR QUALITY: PROSECUTORS FILE MISDEMEANOR COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE BUILDING 
OWNERS AND CONTRACTORS UNDER A NEW REGULATION.

<P>
Calling improper building demolitions a major source of airborne asbestos, Los 
Angeles city prosecutors Thursday filed three criminal complaints accusing 
building owners and contractors of asbestos violations at demolition sites in 
Van Nuys and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The three misdemeanor cases, along with four others filed last month in 
Municipal Court, appear to be the first criminal prosecutions under a new 
regulation that tightened controls on demolition and renovation of 
asbestos-containing buildings, regional air quality officials said. City 
prosecutors said they expect to file complaints in other cases soon. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos, a fibrous mineral once widely used in floor tiles, roofing, 
insulation and other building materials, has been linked to lung cancer and 
mesothelioma, a rare and almost invariably fatal form of cancer. Asbestos 
materials are safe when intact, but when broken or pulverized can release 
fibers that are hazardous if inhaled. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants are accused of failing to carefully remove asbestos before 
tearing into buildings, which can loose hazardous asbestos fibers into the air. 
Of the seven prosecutions, four involve the razing of single-family houses or 
small apartments, which were exempt until the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District's tough new rule took effect at the start of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The "cavalier handling of asbestos, either through ignorance or indifference, 
is a major public health problem due to the sheer volume of the material which 
exists in older small buildings that now are being razed or renovated," City 
Atty. Jim Hahn said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
For years the air district enforced federal regulations covering demolition or 
renovation of asbestos-containing buildings. The rules require that asbestos 
material be carefully wetted, removed and packaged for disposal, that 
demolition workers have safety training, and that air district inspectors have 
advance notice so they can monitor the work. 
</P>
<P>
However, the federal regulations exempted single-family residences and 
apartment buildings of four units or less. They also excused jobs in which the 
amount of asbestos to be disturbed was less than 160 square feet or 260 linear 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
The new rule, which took effect Jan. 1, eliminated those exemptions in the 
South Coast district, which includes Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties. Now, single family residences are covered and safety rules 
apply to all demolition and renovation jobs, regardless of the volume of 
asbestos. Owner-occupants of single-family residences cannot be charged with 
violations, but their contractors can. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess there's a trend in Southern California to buy a house on a piece of 
land and demolish it, . . . so a good percentage of demolitions and renovations 
involve structures that . . . are not covered by federal regulations," said 
Deputy City Atty. Donald Kass. 
</P>
<P>
Before the new rule, residential projects "were a real concern for us" as a 
large "cumulative source" of airborne asbestos, said Edwin Pupka, senior 
enforcement manager for the air district's air toxics control branch. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how unsafe the work, "we had absolutely no authority whatsoever . . . 
to investigate a potential exposure" Pupka said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the new rule took effect, the air district has beefed up its enforcement 
effort, typically assigning four or five inspectors to asbestos cases, compared 
to two or three last year. 
</P>
<P>
Violation notices have also increased -- from 49 in 1988 and 55 in 1989 -- to 
67 through the first three quarters of this year, according to air district 
figures. Frequently, violation notices are issued to more than one party in 
each case. 
</P>
<P>
Some notices result in negotiated settlements and penalties paid to the 
district, but others are referred to county or city prosecutors for criminal 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
One of the cases filed Thursday involved the demolition last January of two 
houses in Van Nuys to make room for a 28-unit condominium project. In razing 
the houses at Hamlin Street and Kester Avenue, workers tore up vinyl flooring 
containing 5% asbestos without taking precautions, according to air district 
citations filed with the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
One of the site owners and the demolition contractor pleaded ignorance about 
the asbestos rule when cited Jan. 11, according to the report by the inspector. 
But when he returned the next day, workmen still were handling the flooring 
without wetting it down or wearing protective clothing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce M. Kates and Alan Shuman, owners of the site, and Ike and Sigal Yarom, 
described as officers of the demolition firm, were each charged with failure to 
properly remove asbestos; to test for asbestos before demolishing the 
buildings; to properly package and dispose of asbestos material; and to comply 
with record-keeping requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Each count carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Kates said he and Shuman later hired a licensed asbestos contractor to remove 
the material. "We were asked to do it correctly, we did do it correctly. Beyond 
that, I don't know what the hell we can do," Kates said. 
</P>
<P>
Ike Yarom said he was unaware of the complaint and was not an officer of the 
demolition firm. 
</P>
<P>
Another complaint involved the demolition of an asbestos-containing apartment 
complex at 500 S. Berendo St. in Los Angeles. The defendant in that case, 
demolition contractor James T. Rudometkin, said he had asked the owner for an 
asbestos survey of the building before starting work, and had been told that no 
asbestos was found.

WEEKENDER: PROFESSOR LEADS THE WAY IN RENEWING A CHICANO CHRISTMAS TRADITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It started out as a lesson for a Mexican-American studies class at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Miguel Dominguez wanted his students to experience Mexican culture rather 
than read about it in a textbook. At the same time, he wanted to establish a 
direct link between the university and the nearby historic Rancho Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
So, three years ago, Dominguez (no relation to the founders of the rancho) and 
a handful of students asked the ranch for permission to stage a posada, the 
traditional Mexican re-enactment of Joseph and Mary's search for room at an 
inn. It has become an annual event and has taken on the trappings of a 
broader-reaching Mexican folk festival. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Mexican tradition, called Las Posadas, involves several 
processions that take place on a series of nights, the Rancho Dominguez 
celebration is a one-day event. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Dominguez's students will again act out the Nativity story at the 
ranch, and the festival will include dancing, food and pinatas. Tours will be 
given of the Dominguez Adobe, decorated with 19th-Century Christmas artifacts. 
There will also be a performance by the Ballet Cultural de Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Students learn faster if they actually go through what it is to become part of 
a culture," Dominguez said. "It is not adequately learned about in textbooks." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez said that although the custom has its roots in Old California and 
Mexico, until recently many Chicanos were unfamiliar with the tradition. Its 
resurgence, Dominguez said, reflects the growing presence of Latino immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"Las Posadas is an old Mexican custom and was celebrated in Old California long 
before it became part of the United States," Dominguez said. "It is only 
fitting that a posada be held at the Dominguez Adobe -- the site of the state's 
first Spanish land grant." 
</P>
<P>
He encourages participants on Sunday to wear traditional Mexican dress, such as 
ponchos for men and blusas tipicas for women. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Ponce, a political science junior minoring in Mexican-American studies, 
said the celebration brings back a lot of memories. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a nostalgic tie," she said. "I attended (a posada) one time when 
I was in Mexico. (This is) basically a smaller version of what goes on in 
Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Ponce said the festival is a source of pride among students, who have been 
preparing for the event since the semester began in September. 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps us in touch with our culture," Ponce said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 students have been working on colorful decorations, sprucing up the 
ranch and preparing food. Traditional Mexican tamales and pan dulce, a sweet 
bread, will be offered for sale. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, the posadas generally take place in homes from Dec. 16 to Christmas 
Eve. 
</P>
<P>
A typical posada consists of a small procession that winds up at a different 
house each night. Sometimes, large figures of Mary and Joseph are carried at 
the head of the procession. At others, children act out the parts of Mary and 
Joseph, angels and shepherds. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival at a designated house, the people in the procession ask for 
lodging from others in the house. What takes place is a ceremony in song during 
which the people outside and the innkeepers inside banter back and forth until 
the latter are persuaded to allow the procession to enter. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dominguez: "Then the party starts." ANTHONY MILLICAN

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOLESTER OF 3 DEAF CAMPERS SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aformer camp counselor was sentenced Thursday to a year in County Jail for 
molesting three teen-agers at a Castaic camp for deaf children this summer. 
</P>
<P>
In a plea bargain with prosecutors, Martin Luther Willis, 19, pleaded no 
contest in August to charges of sodomy, sexual battery and child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents involved two 16-year-olds and a 13-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Willis, who is deaf, was arrested Aug. 10 at the Lion's of California/Nevada 
Wilderness Camp for Deaf Children. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were called to the camp after a camp 
official learned about the molestations from a teen-ager there. 
</P>
<P>
Willis had been a counselor at the camp for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Had the case gone to trial, Willis could have faced nine years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors agreed to the plea bargain because of Willis' age and to prevent 
the victims from having to testify.

REPORT DETAILS DEVASTATION OF A BIG QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials Thursday released a doomsday earthquake scenario for San Diego 
and said the $350,000 document should be used as the basis for emergency 
response planning. 
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive document, five years in the making, outlines the devastating 
effects a temblor of 6.8 on the Richter scale could have on the city, its 
structures and its capacity to provide emergency care and services. 
</P>
<P>
Although the report provides much detailed information about specific effects 
on facilities caused by such a quake, it does not mention two other undoubted 
consequences: deaths and injuries, or the cost estimates of damage. 
</P>
<P>
The 181-page study represents the state's final report on the earthquake 
scenario. The Times ran an extensive story last month on the scenario based on 
a draft of the report. There was little change between the two reports. 
</P>
<P>
State and local officials said they intend to use the report to help formulate 
better emergency response plans and to focus more attention on safeguarding 
equipment and facilities that could be damaged by a big quake. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario of a 6.8 quake was used because state officials say that is 
probably the largest temblor that would hit the area, judging by San Diego's 
major fault line, the Rose Canyon fault. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they hope the report will also spur citizens to become more 
aware of what they can do to prepare for a large earthquake and to have the 
supplies necessary to be self-sufficient for 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The report was prepared by the California Department of Conservation's Division 
of Mines and Geology. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Phelps, operations officer for the county's Office of Disaster 
Preparedness, said the study will be used as a basis for a major countywide 
emergency response drill scheduled for late next year.

COUNTY IN BRIEF: TARZANA; 
</P>
<P>
HOSPITAL FINED FOR TOXIC GAS EXPOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State job-safety inspectors have fined a Tarzana hospital nearly $5,000 after a 
technician was exposed to a suspected cancer-causing gas leaking from a machine 
used to sterilize surgical instruments. But Cal/OSHA officials dropped more 
than $12,000 in additional fines against Tarzana Regional Medical Center after 
deciding that they could not prove the hospital didn't have proper mechanical 
controls to prevent future leaks, a spokesman said. The hospital was cited on 
Oct. 2 for 18 violations of state worker-protection laws, including five repeat 
offenses.

Africa will have a third team in the 1994 World Cup and the North and Central 
American and Caribbean zones could have three teams, too, soccer's world 
governing body decided. 
</P>
<P>
The executive committee of the Federation of International Football 
Associations met for the first time since last summer's World Cup and rejected 
Asia's bid for a third spot. 
</P>
<P>
It also banned Iraq from all international games because of the Gulf crisis, 
banned Colombia from playing host to international games because of drug 
violence, and kicked Costa Rica out of the 1992 Olympic soccer tournament 
because it used an overage player in a youth tournament five years ago.

PACKERS' MAJKOWSKI OUT FOR SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
GREEN BAY: TORN ROTATOR CUFF NOT CALLED CAREER THREATENING, BUT QUARTERBACK 
WON'T BE ABLE TO THROW FOR THREE TO SIX MONTHS.

Green Bay Packer quarterback Don Majkowski underwent surgery Thursday to repair 
a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder and will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Lindy Infante said surgeons who performed the operation in San Diego did 
not characterize the injury as career threatening, but said Majkowski would not 
be able to throw for three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors feel very good about his chances for full recovery. There was no 
mention of career ending or anything remotely like that. The prognosis is a 
good one. They feel the repair is successful," Infante said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Dr. Gary Losse and Dr. David Flood initially were performing an 
arthroscopic procedure to repair an impinged nerve but then discovered a 
1/2-inch-by- 1/2-inch tear in a tendon in the rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors then made a separate 1 1/2-inch incision to repair the tear in a 
90-minute procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski, 26, has not played since being injured Nov. 18 at Phoenix when he 
was tackled hard by Cardinal lineman Freddie Joe Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
Tests in Green Bay earlier revealed nothing more than a bruised rotator cuff, 
team doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
Packers team physician E.S. Brusky had cleared Majkowski to play last Sunday 
against Seattle, but Majkowski, who had tried to throw during two practices, 
said the pain was too severe and objected. 
</P>
<P>
He then decided to seek a second opinion and flew to San Diego on Wednesday.

<P>
Lisa Leslie and Coach Frank Scott have moved on, but Inglewood Morningside 
still is the team to beat during the 1990-91 girls' basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, who was named state player of the year the last two seasons, is a 
freshman at USC, and Scott, who led the Monarchs to two consecutive Division I 
state championships, is in his first season as a Trojan assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Ron Randle, Morningside's first-year coach, should have no problem 
continuing the Monarchs' winning ways, and they hold the top position in The 
Times' Southern California preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
1. MORNINGSIDE 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Division I 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer League. Last Season (32-3) 
</P>
<P>
Opposing coaches may not pull their teams off the court at halftime trailing, 
102-24, as South Torrance Coach Gil Ramirez did last season, but they may want 
to. Leslie is gone, but the Monarchs have their other starters back. Leading 
the way will be Princess Murray, a 5-foot-10 senior guard, and Janet Davis, a 
6-3 junior forward. Akiba Flanagan and Tyesha Whiting, who combined to average 
15 points and 13 rebounds a game last season, also return. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside will not have to wait long to find out how good it is. The Monarchs 
will be tested early in the Santa Barbara Tournament of Champions starting 
Wednesday. The key for Morningside may well be the play of underclassmen Tina 
Thompson, a 6-1 sophomore, and Tameka Kirby, a 5-9 freshman. 
</P>
<P>
2. CHINO 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Division I 
</P>
<P>
Baseline League. Last Season: 27-3 
</P>
<P>
Coach Joe Murillo has won three Southern Section titles, and this season's 
Chino team may be his best. The Cowgirls will be led by Beth Beers, a 6-3 
center; Francine Moreno, a 5-8 junior, and Michelle Kahler, a 5-6 point guard. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Chino lost to Morningside, 75-48, in the Southern Section 5-AA 
Division semifinals, but look for a better showing from the Cowgirls this 
season with the addition of sophomore Amee Pina and junior Keri Collins. Chino 
will also be in the Santa Barbara Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
3. VENTURA BUENA 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Division I 
</P>
<P>
Channel League. Last Season: 26-2. 
</P>
<P>
After winning its first 26 games last season, Buena lost to Newhall Hart in the 
Southern Section 5-A Division final and then lost to Morningside in the first 
round of the state playoffs. This season, Coach Joe Vaughan's Bulldogs are deep 
again, with guard Mia Palkie, an All-Southern Section performer last season, 
and Leanne Ishikawa, who showed improvement last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughan, who began the season with a 342-31 record, also will have returning 
starter Jennifer Wells and sophomore center April Buck. The Bulldogs will be 
tested on Jan. 18, when they play host to the nation's top-rated team, Christ 
the King of New York. 
</P>
<P>
4. LOS ANGELES WASHINGTON 
</P>
<P>
City Section 4-A Division 
</P>
<P>
Southern League. Last Season: 29-4 
</P>
<P>
Coach Phil Chase no longer has All-City cousins Detra Lockhart and Remitha 
Houston, who graduated, but back is Charisse Sampson, who is considered one of 
the nation's top juniors. Sampson has started for Washington since her freshman 
year and last season averaged 16 points and 14 rebounds a game. Last season, 
the Generals won their second consecutive City title, but lost in the state 
tournament to Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
5. LYNWOOD 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Division I 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 28-3. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Maurice Roberson has three key starters returning, Kim Barfield, a 5-10 
forward who averaged 16 points and 12 rebounds last season; Sheronda Colbert, 
5-11 center, and Bridgette Polk, a 5-9 guard. Last season, the Knights lost to 
Morningside in the Southern Section 5-AA final. 
</P>
<P>
6. PALOS VERDES 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Division III 
</P>
<P>
Ocean League. Last Season: 29-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings will be loaded this season with the addition of transfers Kristen 
Mulligan, who averaged 22.1 points last season for Santa Margarita, and Jeffra 
Gausepohl, a 6-5 junior from Pennsylvania. Coach Wendall Yoshida also has five 
starters back from last season, headed by Monique Morehouse, a 6-3 junior. The 
Sea Kings also will have highly regarded freshman guard Mimi McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
7. LAKEWOOD 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Division I 
</P>
<P>
Moore League. Last Season: 20-5. 
</P>
<P>
It is not difficult to guess where Lakewood's strength will be this season. 
Coach Dow Larson has one of the best inside combinations in the state in 6-2 
Melissa Gower, who averaged 20 points and 13 rebounds last season, and 6-1 
Charon Johnson, who averaged 16 points. Akia Hardy and Keshana Ladet will 
control the backcourt for the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
8. GAHR 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Division II 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
Last Season: 19-6. 
</P>
<P>
With the addition of Allison Arredondo, who transferred from Los Alamitos, Gahr 
figures to be a force. Coach Tom Pryor also has his five starters from last 
season. Arredondo, a 6-1 junior, who averaged 20 points and 10 rebounds last 
season and will join Shemekia Brown, a 6-2 center who averaged nine points and 
seven rebounds last season; Kris Waldorf, a junior guard; and Cindy Alen, a 6-0 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
9. OXNARD CHANNEL ISLANDS 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Division I 
</P>
<P>
Marmonte League. Last Season: 23-7. 
</P>
<P>
Center Sal Tauau, a 6-foot senior who averaged 12 points and 13 rebounds last 
season, is the best of four returning starters for Coach Ryle Lynch-Cole. 
Another senior to be counted on is Candis Carper, a 5-11 forward who averaged 
13 points and 10 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
10. BREA-OLINDA 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Division II 
</P>
<P>
Orange League. Last Season: 33-1. 
</P>
<P>
Last Season, the Wildcats were the Southern Section's top team after defeating 
Morningside and Washington during the regular season but lost in the state 
Division III final. Coach Mark Trakh lost his top guards, Aimee McDaniel and 
Tammy Blackburn, who led the Wildcats to a 63-3 record and two Southern Section 
titles, to graduation, but back are Jinelle Williams and Jody Anton. 
</P>
<P>
11. CARSON 
</P>
<P>
City Section 4-A Division 
</P>
<P>
Pacific League. Last Season: 22-7 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Carson was no match for Washington in the City 4-A semifinals, 
losing, 73-34, but the Colts have six players back from that team. Coach Jay 
Park's top player is 6-1 Bernice Alafua, who averaged 19 points last season. 
Bernetta James and RayJanette Lampkins will start in the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
12. REDLANDS 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Division I 
</P>
<P>
Citrus Belt League. Last Season: 23-5. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Gary Luebbers has four returning four starters, including Kim Burr, who 
averaged 11 points and seven rebounds a game last season, and Penny Porter, who 
averaged 13 points. Guard Heather Michaelis, who averaged 10 points and seven 
assists, will lead the team at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
13. COSTA MESA ESTANCIA 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Division III 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Coast League. Last Season: 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Estancia rallied in the playoffs to reach the Southern Section 
semifinals, largely on the play of Patrice Lumpkins. Coach Lisa McNamee again 
has Lumpkins, who averaged 13 points, to go along with Melody Earle, who 
averaged 15.3, and Monique Sweet. 
</P>
<P>
14. LOMPOC 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Division III 
</P>
<P>
Northern League. Last Season: 21-4. 
</P>
<P>
All-Southern Section Nicki Manzo looms as the main force for Coach Sherman 
Hansen's Braves this season. Manzo, a 6-5 senior who averaged 24.3 points and 
14.6 rebounds last season, will team with Twilla Sims, who won the State 
300-meter hurdles title two years ago, and freshman Kim Wuiest. 
</P>
<P>
15. SANTA MARIA ST. JOSEPH 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Division IV 
</P>
<P>
Los Padres League. Last Season: 28-4 
</P>
<P>
Coach Ed Torres has his entire team from last season and that team outscored 
postseason opponents by an average of 37.5 points in reaching the state 
Division IV final. The Knights will be led by the McConnell twins, Amy, who 
averaged 16.7 points and 16.7 rebounds; and Anna, who averaged 16.5 points and 
6.3 assists. Claudia Nunez and Jennifer Anaya will also play key roles for the 
Knights.

HOLLYPARK RIFT: HUBBARD'S BACKGROUND IS QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, TIMES ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The current operators of Hollywood Park, embroiled in a bitter power struggle 
for control of the race track, have questioned the background of R.D. Hubbard 
in a letter to the California Horse Racing Board. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard, the owner of race tracks in New Mexico and Kansas, has initiated a 
proxy fight to remove the current board of directors, including Chief Executive 
Officer Marje Everett. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the CHRB, Hollywood Park attorney Robert Forgnone quoted a 1988 
New Mexico State Racing Commission investigator's report that said: "In his 
(Hubbard's) attempts to obtain racing licenses in Kansas, he reportedly gave 
$10,000 to the current Kansas Attorney General (Robert Stephan) to settle a 
sexual assault case." 
</P>
<P>
The New Mexico report, however, was badly worded, and Hubbard was not involved 
in any sexual assault case. In fact, it was Stephan who was sued, and it was 
for sexual harassment, not sexual assault, after firing an employee. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Golder, executive director of the New Mexico State Racing Commission, said 
a partial investigation was conducted, and nothing was found. The investigation 
was limited because of budget problems. Golder also said the reference to 
sexual assault was wrong and has caused much confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin Segel, an attorney for Hubbard, responded by letter to the CHRB saying: 
"Mr. Hubbard has been a close friend of Mr. Stephan for over 20 years, 
significantly prior to his becoming attorney general. In 1985, Mr. Stephan was 
involved in a civil sexual harassment case. His attorney, without disclosing 
this information to Mr. Stephan, asked various friends of Mr. Stephan to 
contribute money to help settle the case. Mr. Hubbard contributed $10,000 to 
settle this effort." 
</P>
<P>
Segel said that it "was purely the act of one friend helping another." 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard was granted racing licenses in both New Mexico and Kansas.

CHAVEZ LEAVES KING, SIGNS SIX-FIGHT DEAL WITH ARUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Julio Cesar Chavez, the Mexican junior-welterweight world champion, signed a 
six-fight contract with Las Vegas promoter Bob Arum Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez's Los Angeles lawyer, Leon Pizante, said the 18-month deal was worth 
about $15 million and would begin May 1. Chavez, who had been unhappy fighting 
for New York promoter Don King, walked out of a King news conference last week 
in Atlantic City, N.J., because, he explained later, he felt King was ignoring 
him. 
</P>
<P>
King was unavailable for comment Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Pizante and Alberto Gonzales, Chavez's American manager, said King's contract 
with Chavez was abrogated when King was unable to provide Chavez with a rich 
rematch with Meldrick Taylor in early 1991. Taylor, beaten by Chavez last 
spring, has signed to fight welterweight champion Aaron Davis instead. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, from Culiacan, defeated Ahn Kyung-Duk Saturday in an title fight at 
Atlantic City. His record is 73-0, but U.S. record keepers list him at 72-1. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bill Cayton, Mike Tyson's estranged manager, says he will try to block Tyson's 
proposed fight with Razor Ruddock next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Don King, Tyson's promoter, said last Sunday, after the former heavyweight 
champion had knocked out Alex Stewart in one round, that Tyson would next meet 
the high-rated Ruddock, probably in April. 
</P>
<P>
But Cayton said Wednesday that he would take steps to prevent the fight, 
because Tyson could make far more money fighting Ruddock by first regaining the 
championship. Cayton also said King agreed to the Ruddock fight primarily to 
avoid a lawsuit by Ruddock's promoter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a typical Don King move," Cayton said. "He's doing this because it's 
in his best interests, not Mike's. He has a troublesome lawsuit pending in 
Edmonton (filed by Murad Muhammad, Ruddock's promoter), and this fight would 
cancel out the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a foolish, unnecessary fight. Mike would make triple the money fighting 
Ruddock after he's won the title back. Also, even though I believe Mike would 
beat Ruddock, it is a high-risk fight for him, because Ruddock is the 
second-best heavyweight in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Cayton was Tyson's co-manager with Jim Jacobs until Jacobs' death in 1988. 
Cayton and Tyson had a falling out shortly afterward, and Tyson has been 
advised by King ever since. Cayton's managerial contract with Tyson does not 
expire until Feb. 12, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Many in boxing wonder why King isn't advising Tyson to sit tight until after 
the Evander Holyfield-George Foreman title fight April 19, then sign to fight 
the winner for the championship, or at least take a low-risk fight or two. 
</P>
<P>
King said he fears Holyfield or Foreman would duck Tyson after their fight. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no guarantee Holyfield's people will want him to fight Mike at any 
time," King said Thursday.

CURTAINS FOR MANY LONDON PLAYS

Britain's West End theater is having a shaky season marked by a string of 
flops, a reliance on American productions and little on the horizon to whet the 
appetite. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling there has been a dip," said Peter Wilkins, deputy managing 
director of Triumph Proscenium Productions, one of the West End's busiest 
production companies. 
</P>
<P>
That's British understatement for "things have been bad." 
</P>
<P>
A revival of Pirandello's "Henry IV," which earned rave reviews for its star, 
Richard Harris, earned no money for its backers and closed Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 3 brought the premature demise of August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning 
"Fences," starring American actor Yaphet Kotto. The play had its London debut 
Sept. 24 to generally fine notices but poor houses, reflecting the customary 
British apathy toward commercial productions of all-black plays. 
</P>
<P>
Another American import, A. R. Gurney's "Love Letters," closed Nov. 17 after a 
scant eight weeks. Although the show started strongly, its policy of rotating 
casts backfired. The producers found they had no one to replace the current 
leads, George Peppard and Elaine Stritch. 
</P>
<P>
Above this turmoil, the big musical blockbusters -- "The Phantom of the Opera," 
"Cats," "Miss Saigon," "Les Miserables" -- run serenely on. Agatha Christie's 
"The Mousetrap" is in its 38th year, and sex farces such as "Run for Your Wife" 
also seem to run and run, as the British put it. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on American drama illustrates what's missing: top-drawer British 
plays and revivals. The season's most acclaimed home-grown plays, David Hare's 
"Racing Demon" and Peter Flannery's "Singer," opened at least six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Singer" ended Nov. 3 as the Royal Shakespeare Company shut its doors in London 
for four months to save money. That greatly diminishes the range of work 
available, since the RSC always has five or six shows in repertory. 
</P>
<P>
The best-reviewed play so far this autumn, "Dancing at Lughnasa," by Irish 
dramatist Brian Friel, has played to middling but not great business since its 
Oct. 15 bow at the Royal National Theater's Lyttelton auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
With the economy burdened by 10.9% inflation and interest rates three points 
higher than that, British audiences have become more selective -- and, 
inevitably, smaller. 
</P>
<P>
"To be truthful, people are more choosy about what they will go and see," said 
Wilkins. "If money's tight, they want to be pretty sure they're spending their 
money wisely." 
</P>
<P>
Nor do stars ensure hits, as Richard Harris and Yaphet Kotto have shown. 
</P>
<P>
"The pulling power of stars has to be stronger. We have to have marquee names 
with a stronger appeal," Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
One such actor is Tony Award winner Derek Jacobi, whose showy turn in the title 
role of Jean-Paul Sartre's "Kean" has attracted more than 90% capacity at the 
Old Vic Theater since its opening Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The show transfers to Broadway in February or March, Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Another draw was American actor John Malkovich ("Dangerous Liaisons," "Empire 
of the Sun"). He turned Lanford Wilson's "Burn This" into a West End sell-out 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The future promises little in the way of star wattage, save for back-to-back 
family affairs. On Dec. 5, Laurence Olivier's widow, Joan Plowright, and their 
two daughters open in J. B. Priestley's "Time and the Conways" at the Old Vic 
Theater. Son Richard Olivier directs. 
</P>
<P>
This week, brings the West End bow of Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave and niece Jemma 
in Anton Chekhov's "Three Sisters," at the Queen's Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the lineup is full of TV spinoffs such as "Bread," inspired by the 
popular British TV sitcom, and "Heaven's Up," a family musical starring 
something called Captain Beaky and His Band. 
</P>
<P>
One show that bucks the down-market trend is a commercial transfer of Jean 
Anouilh's "The Rehearsal," which opened Nov. 14 at the Garrick. The play 
launches producer Biddy Hayward's Theater Division company after 17 years 
working for Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Company. 
</P>
<P>
A tragicomedy tale of sexual depravity, "The Rehearsal" was a hit earlier this 
fall at the "fringe" Almeida Theater. So does it seem risky on the West End? 
</P>
<P>
"Everything in life is risky," Hayward said. 
</P>
<P>
The risk for the tourists is that the plays they came to see may have already 
closed. On the other hand, with all those empty seats in town, the chances of 
getting a half-price ticket at the booth in Leicester Square are the best in a 
long time.

PREVIEW: ORCHESTRA CONCERT FOR -- AND BY -- CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This concert would be fun for little kids because it's made for them." 
</P>
<P>
So says Daniel Schlosberg, concertmaster in a free performance Saturday by the 
Junior Orchestra of the CSUN Youth Orchestra Academy. Daniel should know what 
small children would like since, at 12, he isn't far removed from being one 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean Daniel doesn't know his stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very accomplished player," said Wes Kenney, director of the youth 
orchestra, which actually is two orchestras. The junior group is made up of 65 
players ages 11 to 14. The Senior Orchestra has 50 members from 14 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
"They both play at a higher level of difficulty than most school ensembles are 
capable of," Kenney said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's "Music for Children" concert, set for 2 p.m. at Cal State 
Northridge's Recital Hall, includes pieces by Copland, Mendelssohn, Meyerbeer 
and Piccini. In keeping with the holiday season, some of the works are carols 
and hymns. 
</P>
<P>
Kenney believes that a special empathy develops at a concert where both the 
audience and the performers are young. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids can immediately identify that this is something they can do," he said. 
"On the stage are people their own age, perhaps classmates. There are other 
concerts for kids, but they're performed by adults." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the orchestra is drawn from the San Fernando Valley, but members also 
live in West Los Angeles, Malibu, Oxnard, Ventura and Pasadena. The group is 
called the CSUN Youth Orchestra Academy because it is housed at CSUN. 
Rehearsals take place every Saturday. The junior and senior orchestras each 
perform about three times a year. A chamber orchestra, made up of the best 
players combined with professional musicians, also gives occasional concerts. 
</P>
<P>
"Our focus is teaching young people ensemble performance," Kenney said. "We 
pick a program, a selection of music, and rehearse it for eight or nine weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Tuition for the children is $225 for a season that runs from September to May. 
</P>
<P>
Kenney lives in San Francisco and flies in for rehearsals and concerts. He 
works as librarian for the Marin Symphony and has been guest conductor for the 
Spokane Symphony and other orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
The junior and senior ensembles are full orchestras, but like a Little League 
coach who has trouble finding a catcher, Kenney says some positions are hard to 
fill. 
</P>
<P>
"Viola and string bass are No. 1 on the Christmas wish list," he said. "In 
winds, trombones are down in ranks. French horns are difficult to find. I 
always have lots and lots of flutes." 
</P>
<P>
In Daniel, who lives in Sherman Oaks, Kenney has both a violinist and pianist. 
Being concertmaster is no big deal, Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
"You just have to lead and get all the right bowings and carry out the 
conductor's signals," he said. "The other players, maybe they can't see the 
conductor and so they have to follow your bowing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he prefers the piano. 
</P>
<P>
"I spend more time with it, maybe because it's easier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music for Children" performed at 2 p.m. Saturday by the Junior Orchestra of 
the CSUN Youth Orchestra Academy in Cal State Northridge's Recital Hall, 18111 
Nordhoff St. Admission is free. Call (818) 885-3074.

RULING FREES DOCTOR WHO AIDED SUICIDE; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: MICHIGAN LAW DOES NOT FORBID SUCH ACTION, JUDGE SAYS, BUT PROSECUTORS 
MAY APPEAL DECISION IN CASE OF INVENTOR OF DEATH DEVICE.

A judge on Thursday dismissed a first-degree murder charge against the inventor 
of a suicide device, saying he broke no law in helping an Alzheimer's disease 
patient kill herself. 
</P>
<P>
The judge announced his decision after hearing a tape of the Oregon woman 
discussing her fight against the disease. "I've had enough," she said on the 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Adkins suffered from Alzheimer's disease, but she might still be alive 
had she not turned on Dr. Jack Kevorkian's device on June 4, District Judge 
Gerald McNally said at the end of Kevorkian's two-day preliminary examination. 
</P>
<P>
But, because Michigan law does not forbid suicide or assisting in it, 
prosecutors had no case against Kevorkian, McNally said in dismissing the 
charge against the 62-year-old retired pathologist from Royal Oak. 
</P>
<P>
There was scattered applause in the courtroom as Kevorkian turned to shake the 
hand of his lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm walking on a cloud," Kevorkian said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Modelski, chief assistant Oakland County prosecutor, said his office 
was considering whether to appeal McNally's ruling to the Circuit Court. That 
court could reinstate the first-degree murder charge or a lesser charge, such 
as second-degree murder or manslaughter, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dismissal, Kevorkian is not free to use his device again. 
</P>
<P>
Three days after Adkins died, prosecutors obtained a temporary court order 
preventing further use of the device. It remains in police custody pending a 
civil trial on whether that order should be made permanent, Fieger said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Richard Thompson filed the murder charge six months after Adkins 
died in the back of Kevorkian's van in a county-owned campground. Kevorkian 
notified authorities after Adkins was dead. He was questioned by state police 
officers but was not arrested until Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Autopsy results released in late November showed that Adkins, 54, of Portland, 
committed suicide with an overdose of medication. Fieger said in closing 
arguments that Kevorkian attached an intravenous tube to Adkins' right arm, but 
the tube carried only a harmless saline solution. 
</P>
<P>
The drugs that caused Adkins to lose consciousness and then stopped her heart 
did not enter her body until after she threw the switch on Kevorkian's device, 
Fieger said. 
</P>
<P>
Closing arguments were heard after the prosecution played a videotape that 
police officers had seized when searching Kevorkian's apartment. On the tape, 
made June 2 in a motel room, Kevorkian, Adkins and her husband, Ronald, discuss 
her struggle with Alzheimer's, which causes irreversible brain degeneration, 
and her decision to ask for Kevorkian's help in ending her life. 
</P>
<P>
Adkins gave short and generally clear answers to questions posed by Kevorkian 
and her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"My life before was wonderful," Adkins says. "I could play the piano and read. 
I can't do any of those things (now) . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you want your life to end?" Kevorkian asks. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had enough," Adkins answers, her voice breaking.

in it, essentially leaving prosecutors with no case. Associated Press

BENNETT DECLINES GOP LEADERSHIP POST, CREATING CONFUSION, PROBLEMS FOR BUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former drug czar William J. Bennett created embarrassing confusion for 
President Bush Thursday when he turned down the President's offer to head the 
Republican Party, saying the job would cost him too much in lost speaking and 
writing fees. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett blamed his rejection of the job on White House lawyers, saying they had 
changed their advice to him on how federal ethics laws would affect his plans 
to earn tens of thousands of dollars by moonlighting as a public speaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't take a vow of poverty," Bennett told White House reporters. "Two 
weeks ago, I got a green light (to earn outside fees). Two days ago, I got a 
yellow-to-red." 
</P>
<P>
But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bennett only recently told 
officials the full scope of his future money-making plans. "We found out more 
information about his financial situation. That's the big factor," Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides denied widespread speculation that the real problem was Bennett's 
discovery that White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu planned to make most 
decisions about politics himself, leaving Bennett with little authority as 
chairman of the Republican National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"John Sununu is a close friend of mine," Bennett said after hand-delivering to 
the chief of staff his letter turning down Bush's job offer. Bennett was 
"Sununu's choice," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the explanation, Bennett's abrupt withdrawal from a job Bush publicly 
offered him only two weeks ago plunged the President into another difficult 
political position and further strained his relations with conservatives, who 
saw the outspoken Bennett as their champion. 
</P>
<P>
Some conservatives insisted that Bennett's decision to back out of the job must 
have been shaped by more than monetary motives. 
</P>
<P>
"He realized he couldn't work with Bush and Sununu up close," said one 
right-wing activist. "The ideological contrast between him and Bush was just 
too great." 
</P>
<P>
Bush would now pick "an absolute Bush loyalist" for the chairmanship, a 
conservative suggested, reasoning that Bush would not risk further 
embarrassment by picking someone driven more by ideology than personal fealty. 
</P>
<P>
One widely mentioned name was that of Secretary of Commerce Robert A. 
Mosbacher, an old friend of Bush who has been rumored to be weary of his 
Cabinet post. 
</P>
<P>
Other possibilities include several Republican House members who were defeated 
in the November campaign. But some of these, such as Rhode Island Rep. Claudine 
Schneider and Illinois Rep. Lynn Martin, might be considered too moderate to 
suit right-wing tastes. 
</P>
<P>
Martin and another defeated member of Congress, Rep. Patricia Saiki of Hawaii, 
are also considered leading candidates to fill two vacancies in the Cabinet, at 
the departments of Labor and Education, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The legal dilemma Bennett faced also illustrated the increasing scrutiny being 
placed on ethical questions in Washington's current atmosphere. Ironically, 
Bennett's brother, Robert, is currently in the midst of the city's hottest 
ethics issue as the special counsel investigating the Senate's "Keating Five." 
</P>
<P>
Of the lawyers he consulted, "my brother was the most emphatic about not taking 
-- putting myself in this kind of risk," Bennett told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The risk Bennett referred to involves restrictions the law places on former 
executive branch officials to avoid improper lobbying. Under the law, former 
officials such as Bennett are barred for one year from "contacts" with any 
person in their former office on behalf of outside organizations from which 
they receive money. 
</P>
<P>
In Bennett's case, his former office as Bush's drug policy adviser is the 
Executive Office of the President -- the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, Fitzwater noted, if Bennett were to receive money for speaking 
to an energy group during his first year out of office, he might be barred from 
talking to Bush or any Bush aide about energy policy. If he spoke to an 
agriculture group for a fee, he could be barred from discussing farm policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was the appearance of taking fees from people about whom it could 
be charged that he was lobbying," said White House counsel C. Boyden Gray. "In 
the technical sense," there might not be any violation, Gray said. But because 
the party chairman must meet regularly with the President and top aides, "there 
would always be (an) appearance problem." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett also has a contract with Simon &amp; Schuster to write two books, for 
which he received a six-figure advance. As GOP head, Bennett feared he could 
not finish the work, officials said. 
</P>

ALBANIA SENDS TROOPS TO PUT DOWN RIOTING BY 'HOOLIGANS'

Communist Albania on Thursday ordered soldiers to quell an attack on officials 
and buildings by "hooligans" armed with knives, stones and iron bars, its 
official media reported. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks in the northern city of Shkodra came one day after a peaceful rally 
by tens of thousands of people in the capital, Tirana, celebrating the founding 
of the country's first non-Communist party, the Democratic Party of Albania. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists said that Tirana, about 80 miles south of Shkodra, remained calm 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Official reports said attackers with knives and iron bars assaulted the police 
chief and two other policemen in the city of Shkodra. 
</P>
<P>
Official Albanian Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London, 
said gangs were "throwing stones at the district government and party buildings 
and committing acts of vandalism inside the local radio station." 
</P>
<P>
"In order to reimpose order and calm in the city and to defend government and 
social institutions, the forces of public order and the army came into action," 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
A later ATA report said the rioters were "without any political aims." However, 
the attacks suggest that tension in the small Balkan country is unlikely to die 
down, despite official concessions during a week of protests. 
</P>
<P>
Albania has for decades kept a tight lid on protest but has recently allowed 
limited reforms.

HONIG, SCHOOL BOARD STILL AT ODDS AFTER TALKS 
</P>

<P>
Although State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig and the State Board of 
Education tried Thursday to put a good face on efforts to sort out how much 
authority each should have over California educational policy, the two sides 
still seemed far apart on key issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we did make progress," Honig told the board's policy and planning 
committee about several meetings in recent weeks. He said he was hopeful that 
final agreement could be reached when the board next meets in January. 
</P>
<P>
Said Howard L. Dickstein, special counsel to the board, "While agreement was 
not reached, there was movement by the superintendent that I consider 
significant." 
</P>
<P>
However, the 35-minute discussion that followed brought out at least two 
important issues on which there is still substantial disagreement: 
</P>
<P>
* How much the 11-member board should be involved in reviewing budget decisions 
made by Honig and other Department of Education administrators. 
</P>
<P>
* What the board's role should be in appointing and evaluating top officials in 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
A Dickstein "memo of understanding" that has served as a basis for the 
negotiations would give board members significantly increased authority both in 
preparing the annual education budget and in making sure the funds are spent 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the board would have to approve all personal service contracts of 
more than $20,000 and changes in the budget involving expenditures of more than 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Honig called these provisions "getting into the day-by-day administration of 
the department" and claimed they were "taken off the table" and will remain 
under his control. 
</P>
<P>
But Dickstein disagreed, saying: "The scope of these discussions is 
comprehensive. Every issue that is in that memo is being discussed." 
</P>
<P>
Honig later suggested to reporters that he and the board might submit separate 
budgets in the future and the governor and Legislature could decide which to 
consider. 
</P>
<P>
The Dickstein memo also proposes that the board approve high-level Department 
of Education appointments and review the employees' performance annually. 
Additionally, it calls on Honig to appoint a deputy superintendent and three 
associate superintendents, positions that are called for in the state 
Constitution but have been left vacant during his eight years in office. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of making these appointments, which are for four-year terms, Honig has 
used another process to hire top aides whose terms are indefinite. 
</P>
<P>
The superintendent indicated Thursday that he would not agree to adopt the 
procedure set out in the Dickstein memo. 
</P>
<P>
The principal issue between the superintendent and the board is how involved 
the board, made up of part-time appointees of the governor, should be in 
managing the 1,400-employee department. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said he is willing to grant the board "policy review" but would continue 
to resist what he called "day-by-day micro-management." 
</P>
<P>
But what the superintendent sees as "micro-management" is a crucial part of 
what some board members are seeking. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's absolutely essential that the board have control over program 
mix, dollar mix and any promiscuous movement of money from one program to 
another," Board President Joseph D. Carrabino said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, board members have not succeeded even in obtaining office space and 
telephones. 
</P>
<P>
When Carrabino raised that issue, Honig said that was "one of the items in the 
discussion" and should be part of a final "package."

PLANE IN FATAL CRASH TOOK OFF DESPITE FLAW

The fault-detection system of a Saudi-bound U.S. military transport plane was 
out of order when the plane crashed Aug. 29, killing 13 people. But the 
aircraft was permitted to take off anyway, the Air Force said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The crash apparently was caused by a faulty thrust-reverser that kicked in 
during takeoff, stalling the plane's climb and hampering the pilots' ability to 
control it, according to a report on the accident. 
</P>
<P>
But the plane's flight crew probably was not warned of the malfunction because 
one of the craft's safety systems was not working. 
</P>
<P>
Accident investigators said the C-5A Galaxy was operating under a waiver from 
the Air Force when it took off during the fourth week of deployments to 
Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
A thrust-reverser stuck in the "on" position would produce drag capable of 
slowing an aircraft's acceleration and hindering its efforts to climb on 
takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
Had the plane's fault-detector system been working, a light would have alerted 
pilots to the thrust-reverser's malfunction and the plane's hydraulic system 
would have reacted to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred 2,765 feet from the end of the runway at Ramstein Air Base 
in Germany. The flight was bound for Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, carrying a crew of 
nine and eight military passengers, as well as food and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
It was the worst accident since the deployment of U.S. troops to the Middle 
East began. With the deaths of two Marines in unrelated incidents last 
Wednesday, the toll of Operation Desert Shield climbed to 56. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. George Sillia, an Air Force spokesman, said the waiver permitting the 
C-5A to take off was a "standing regulation" for "everyday use" and not an 
emergency exception issued for the crisis deployment. The waiver was intended 
to permit the crew to fly from Ramstein to nearby Rhein Mein Air Base to get 
the problem fixed.

'SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS' ON TRUCE IN ANGOLA REPORTED AFTER TALKS

Representatives of the two warring factions in Angola met Thursday with three 
outside mediators, and a joint statement issued afterward reported "significant 
progress" toward a cease-fire in the country's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Joining the Angolans at the talks were officials from the United States, the 
Soviet Union and Portugal, the former colonial power in Angola and site of the 
five rounds of peace talks held thus far this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that significant progress has been made and that the prospects for 
a successful sixth round of negotiations in Lisbon early next year have been 
enhanced," the joint statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the delegates were favorably impressed by the friendly 
atmosphere created by the two Angolan parties as well as by the seriousness of 
their approach to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Soviet and Portuguese participants held a news conference late 
Thursday but declined to cite the areas in which progress was made. They also 
said the discussion was an exchange of views rather than a negotiating session. 
</P>
<P>
Herman J. Cohen, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, 
said the "main point of agreement" is that Angola's leftist government is now 
willing to implement constitutional changes to convert Angola from a one-party 
Marxist state to a multi-party democracy. This was agreed to at a party 
congress last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and the Soviet Union have been arming opposite sides in the 
conflict but have agreed to stop weapons shipments once a cease-fire agreement 
is reached. The war has dragged on for 15 years and killed hundreds of 
thousands of Angolans. 
</P>
<P>
Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Angolan rebel movement UNITA, said Thursday after 
a meeting with President Bush that peace prospects have improved as a result of 
joint efforts by the superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think both the United States and the Soviet Union are joining hands in 
trying to find a solution to the Angolan problem," Savimbi said after a 
20-minute meeting with Bush, during which he thanked Bush for U.S. support for 
his forces. 
</P>
<P>
He said his goal is a truce in early 1991 and free and fair elections by the 
end of the year. He said the rival factions in Angola are close to a 
settlement.

South Korean President Roh Tae Woo arrived in Moscow on Thursday, the first 
South Korean head of state to visit the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Roh, accompanied by his wife and a 15-person entourage that included Foreign 
Minister Choi Ho Joong, landed in the Soviet capital Thursday afternoon and had 
an evening meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Roh has said he will try to secure Gorbachev's help in ending the Cold War 
confrontation between North and South Korea. Gorbachev is expected to press for 
greatly expanded economic cooperation with South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to sign agreements for increased trade and 
economic cooperation. Roh said in Seoul that his country would like to import 
natural gas, timber and coal from the Soviet Union as well as technological 
expertise in exchange for electrical appliances, cars and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and Roh, whose countries had been adversaries since the end of World 
War II, met in San Francisco six months ago, and their governments announced 
Sept. 30 that they would establish diplomatic relations.

NUCLEAR PLANT RADIATION EXPOSURE LIMITS TIGHTENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The government Thursday tightened its radiation exposure limits for workers in 
nuclear power plants and people living near them for the first time in 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In taking the action, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the lower limits 
would help ensure "a substantial increase in the overall protection of the 
public health and safety." 
</P>
<P>
For the public, the limits are being tightened fivefold, reflecting concern 
among many scientists and physicians that leukemia and other cancers often can 
result from even low levels of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
Public exposure is to be reduced to 0.1 rem per year from the previous limit of 
0.5 rems. A rem is the standard unit of measurement for radiation. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the average passenger on a round-trip coast-to-coast airplane 
trip absorbs 5 millirems (.005 rems), and a patient who is given a chest X-ray 
receives 6 millirems of radiation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Plant workers will be allowed higher dosages than the public, up to a combined 
exposure inside and outside the workplace of 5 rems. The commission said that 
plant employees are not now at risk but that the new guidelines will add an 
extra margin of safety. 
</P>
<P>
Studies show that actual exposures of employees remain very low, with 97% of 
all workers having absorbed less than 2 rems in 1987, the last year for which 
figures are available, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It is much easier for the commission to monitor plant workers than the public, 
since employees must wear devices to measure the radiation they receive. To 
ensure compliance with radiation levels affecting the public, the government 
will rely on regular plant inspections and on air samples and other readings 
taken around the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the revisions will impose an added cost of about $170 million 
on the industry. They said its principal impact will be at uranium processing 
plants, many of which may have to take major steps to meet tougher standards on 
airborne uranium. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-nuclear groups charged that the new rules contain a loophole allowing the 
industry to seek NRC approval for "planned special exposures" above the newly 
established occupational limit. Such an exemption would risk higher dosages for 
workers, if not the public, they said.

THE 'JACKIE ROBINSON SYNDROME' -- A DOUBLE STANDARD; 
</P>
<P>
HIRING: MANY NEWSPAPERS WILL EMPLOY MINORITIES ONLY IF THEY ARE SUPERSTARS -- 
SUPERIOR PERFORMERS -- WHILE WHITES ARE HELD TO A MORE AVERAGE STANDARD, SOME

<P>
It happened about 15 years ago, but Joel Dreyfuss can still remember the day a 
newsroom executive at the Washington Post walked up to him and asked where she 
could find "other blacks as good as Joel Dreyfuss." 
</P>
<P>
Dreyfuss, now an associate editor at Fortune magazine, was a reporter at the 
Post then and he replied: 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you have whites here who aren't as good as me. Hire blacks as good as 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Dreyfuss was outraged, but his experience is not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
Too many newspapers trying to recruit minorities are caught up in what Shelby 
Coffey, the editor of the Los Angeles Times, calls "the Jackie Robinson 
syndrome." They won't hire minorities unless they're superstars. 
</P>
<P>
Many white journalists "get by hitting .270 and being only fair second 
basemen," says Coffey, a white; it's wrong to insist that minorities meet a 
higher standard. 
</P>
<P>
But minority journalists say many editors insist on just that. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Some editors genuinely committed to diversifying their newsrooms don't want to 
risk a failure that could inhibit their efforts. Other editors are afraid that 
if a minority doesn't succeed, pressure for diversification will make demotion 
or dismissal difficult. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Max Frankel, executive editor of the New York Times, angered many 
blacks recently when he said that if a black editor were "less than good, I 
would probably stay my hand at removing them too quickly" precisely because 
such action might be perceived as a "political act" and could "hurt the 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
Frankel later explained that he hadn't meant to imply a double standard for 
minorities, but the whole question of standards -- double and other -- is both 
part of the "Jackie Robinson syndrome" and one of the most sensitive aspects of 
the entire newsroom diversification issue. 
</P>
<P>
Editors who want to hire only superstar minorities -- or editors who don't want 
to hire any minorities -- often reject minority applicants because, "They don't 
meet our standards." It is perhaps the most common explanation given for the 
low percentage of minority editors and reporters -- and the explanation that 
most angers minorities. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, some minorities don't meet the standards of some newspapers -- just 
as some whites don't meet those standards. Given historic patterns of 
discrimination, education and journalistic indifference to minorities, the 
problem is no doubt more acute for certain minorities. 
</P>
<P>
As Thomas Greer, the black editor of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, says, "You 
have to have a good working relationship with the English language to work for 
a newspaper. Unfortunately, too many blacks don't have that relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Some white editors assume all blacks lack that relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Bunting, a black who is metropolitan editor of the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram, 
says that an editor at another paper he worked for as a reporter once came to 
him after he'd been there three weeks and said, in what was clearly intended as 
a compliment, "I've been reading your copy for three weeks now -- and you can 
spell." 
</P>
<P>
Like Bunting, many blacks -- and many Latinos, Asian-Americans and Native 
Americans -- have splendid working relationships with the English language. But 
many white editors still say, "They don't meet our standards" or "They're not 
qualified." 
</P>
<P>
"The plaint . . . 'We can't find qualified Negroes' rings hollow from an 
industry where, only yesterday, jobs were scarce and promotion unthinkable for 
a man whose skin was black," the Kerner Commission on civil disorders said in 
1968. Today -- 22 years and 14 black Pulitzer Prize winners later -- minority 
journalists say that same explanation is worse than hollow. 
</P>
<P>
"Any paper that uses the excuse 'We can't find anybody who meets our standards' 
is engaging in bullshit," says Bob McGruder, managing editor for news at the 
Detroit Free Press. "I know that there are some black journalists in this 
country that could meet the standards of any newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about serious, important . . . work," says McGruder, a black, 
"but we ain't talking about brain surgery." 
</P>
<P>
Minorities are particularly resentful of the invocation of "standards" because 
that suggests people have always advanced via a meritocracy; many minorities 
are convinced that "America is not a meritocracy; it never has been," in the 
words of Linda Williams, assistant business editor at the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Whites are often hired and promoted -- in journalism and elsewhere -- because 
of whom they know or where they went to school or because they're part of an 
old-boy network, and many minorities feel that when white managers reject them 
because they allegedly don't measure up to some "standard," the only standard 
being applied is a double standard. 
</P>
<P>
Should there ever be a double standard? 
</P>
<P>
Al Neuharth thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Gannett Co. before his retirement last year, Neuharth was 
largely responsible for making Gannett an industry leader in minority hiring 
and promotion. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, Neuharth says, he didn't necessarily pick "the most qualified" 
person for a given job, figuring he "had to start somewhere" if his policies 
were to succeed. But he insists he always picked a minority who was qualified. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say that because most Gannett papers are mediocre 
journalistically, it's been easier for them to hire and promote less-qualified 
minorities (and less-qualified whites) than it would be for papers with higher 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
But Neuharth says that while there is "some truth" to the argument that there 
are not enough "qualified" minorities for the best papers, "more often, that's 
an excuse, not a reason." 
</P>
<P>
If an editor can't find "ready, available, qualified" minorities, he says, "you 
have to apply whatever affirmative action philosophy you think is appropriate 
and maybe you lower your standards a little and increase your training efforts 
and develop them into the kind of qualified people that you want." 
</P>
<P>
Many minorities object to this idea -- especially now, when the pool of 
qualified minorities is much larger than when Neuharth first began pushing 
minority recruitment. They fear that any talk of "lowering standards" not only 
triggers resentment among their white colleagues but taints all minority 
journalists. They risk being perceived as not having been good enough to make 
it on their own, says Carol Shirley, a Native American who is assistant editor 
of the Westside section of the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
But newspapers already "lower their standards," says Michael Fancher, executive 
editor of the Seattle Times. They do it every time they hire a person of any 
ethnic background who has good potential instead of someone already more 
accomplished. Fancher recalls hiring a white reporter whose ability at that 
point may not have merited his being hired, "But we . . . . looked at him and 
said, 'There's a guy who's got potential beyond most of the other applicants." 
</P>
<P>
"He comes in the newsroom, and everybody says, 'Gosh, they hired him because 
he's got potential.' If he had been black, the presumption would be, 'Oh, gosh, 
they hired him because he's black.' " 
</P>
<P>
But minorities, in journalism as elsewhere, have often had to worry about 
double standards of varying sorts. 
</P>
<P>
As minorities, they're often expected to write about minority issues. Many are 
eager to do so. Others feel morally obligated to do so, if only because they 
know that if they don't, no one else will. But either way, unless they can be 
both "home boys" on the street "good old boys" when they get back to the 
newsroom, they may not succeed, says Felix Gutierrez, vice president of the 
Gannett Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some minority reporters don't want to write about minorities at all 
because they don't want to be "ghettoized" -- stereotyped as being interested 
only in minority stories. 
</P>
<P>
Minority reporters -- and editors -- may also have to deal with editors who 
don't fully trust them to handle certain stories, even though whites would be 
trusted implicitly on the same subject. 
</P>
<P>
As Joel Dreyfuss of Fortune magazine says, sardonically: 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK to send Leroy out to cover something, but can you respect him sitting 
at the 4 o'clock meeting making decisions about what goes on the front page? 
Can you trust him to cover South Africa fairly?" 
</P>
<P>
When the Washington Post was criticized for going easy on Marion Barry earlier 
in his troubled tenure as mayor of Washington, for example, much of the 
grumbling inside the Post was directed toward Milton Coleman, the assistant 
managing editor in charge of local news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, who is black, denies having shown Barry any favoritism, but it's clear 
he was discomfited at more than a personal level by the criticism; many black 
editors feel a special responsibility to succeed so as not to damage the 
chances of others in their ethnic group -- and they know that any misstep will 
probably be magnified because of their ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike whites -- another double standard -- they don't yet have the freedom to 
fail.

</P>
<P>
POLICE: GATES SAYS ONE WILL BE INDICTED 'FOR SURE' AND OTHERS MAY BE NAMED AS 
PART OF A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION OF ALLEGED DRUG-MONEY SKIMMING. SIX SHERIFF'S 
DEPUTIES ALREADY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED.

<TEXT>
<P>
At least one Los Angeles Police Department narcotics officer will be indicted 
and as many as three others may also face criminal charges in a federal probe 
of alleged drug-money skimming, Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Gates told a City Hall news conference that one officer will be indicted "for 
sure" by the grand jury and "four at the most" may eventually be charged in a 
corruption investigation that has already led to the conviction of six Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies for stealing drug money confiscated in raids. 
</P>
<P>
The money-skimming investigation of the sheriff's deputies, which began two 
years ago, spawned a similar federal inquiry into the activities of narcotics 
officers in the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said his department has conducted a probe into the allegations against 
the four officers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one (officer) that we think is involved in the same way as the 
sheriffs. . . . The other three have other problems and whether or not they'll 
be indicted, I don't know," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
The police chief did not identify the officers but said that the one who faces 
certain indictment had worked with sheriff's deputies on a special anti-drugs 
task force. 
</P>
<P>
That task force, known as the Southwest Region Distribution Crew, was formed by 
the Sheriff's Department in September, 1986, to investigate mid-level drug 
traffickers in Southwest Los Angeles. After Police Department officers joined 
the crew four months later, the nine-member task force stepped up their pursuit 
of major rock-cocaine dealers, including a suspect named Ricky Donnell Ross. 
</P>
<P>
During the seven-week trial of the deputies, former Sheriff's Sgt. Robert R. 
Sobel -- who once supervised the Southwest crew and is cooperating with federal 
prosecutors -- testified that the deputies and police officers under his 
command routinely beat drug suspects, stole money from them, planted narcotics 
on Ross and others and lied in reports to cover up their activities. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas Emmick, who has been overseeing the federal probe, 
refused comment on Gates' statements or the grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
But the police chief indicated that his department's Internal Affairs Division 
has cooperated with federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"We pretty much completed our investigation some time ago and we have been 
supplying that information to the U.S. attorney and he, in turn, has been 
supplying it to the federal grand jury," Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
If the grand jury does not indict some of the police officers, Gates said the 
department may still seek charges against the officers under state law. 
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly looking at that possibility," he said. "There may be a 
statute (of limitations) problem here or there. . . . If the federal grand jury 
does not do anything, we will certainly follow up with the district attorney." 
</P>
<P>
A district attorney's spokesman said that office is not conducting any current 
investigation into any of the police officers or sheriff's deputies. But he 
said local prosecutors would review any case brought by the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"If we feel it warrants prosecution then we will proceed vigorously," spokesman 
Mike Botula said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have already sent letters to defense attorneys in an undetermined 
number of pending and closed drug cases involving the Southwest crew. 
</P>
<P>
But Curtis A. Hazell, chief of the district attorney's major narcotics and 
forfeiture division, said the federal investigation involves "a very limited 
number of people who were believed to be part of a joint task force that worked 
with Sobel's mid-level crew." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the sheriff's deputies who have been relieved of duty, the police 
officers under investigation remain on the job, although they have been 
transferred from narcotics assignments to other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Gates' comments, a lawyer for the police union said none of the 
officers would respond. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to wait until the outcome of the investigation," said Enrique 
Hernandez, associate general counsel for the Los Angeles Police Protective 
League. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the Police Department, the internal investigation 
has branched out from its initial focus on the task force officers to include 
other officers who have been involved in narcotics cases. 
</P>
<P>
"They've turned the place upside down," said one source, "but the other things 
they have found do not involve ripping off any money, or anything as serious as 
that -- at least, so far."

LINDSAY'S STEPSON APPOINTED GUARDIAN OF COUNCILMAN'S ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stepson of ailing Los Angeles City Councilman Gilbert Lindsay was appointed 
temporary conservator of his estate Thursday, an action that sets the stage for 
a lawsuit to reclaim the elderly councilman's property from his former 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief proceeding in Superior Court, a new allegation emerged that the 
woman, Juanda Chauncie, 39, obtained $65,000 from Lindsay's bank account at 
Broadway Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, 90, has been hospitalized since he suffered a stroke Sept. 2 and 
remains partially paralyzed and unable to speak. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers filed Thursday, Herbert Howard, the stepson, said that 
Lindsay's condition is deteriorating and he has no one to provide for him or 
give consent for his medical care. 
</P>
<P>
"We fear that unless he has a conservator appointed immediately, it will result 
in a loss" to Lindsay and his estate, the papers said. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted by telephone at her home Thursday evening, Chauncie hung up on a 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last month that over the last two years, Chauncie has 
obtained a financial interest in much of Lindsay's real estate and is 
attempting to evict an elderly couple from a house Lindsay had rented to them 
for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who drew up Lindsay's will and now represents 
his stepson, said he intends to file a lawsuit within the next few days to 
reclaim that house and other property. 
</P>
<P>
Because Chauncie is attempting to sell the house Lindsay rented to the couple, 
"it is important that a lawsuit be filed immediately . . . to stop the sale," 
Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary conservatorship, which was approved by Superior Court 
Commissioner Ann Stodden, gives Howard authority over Lindsay's estate so that 
he can file the lawsuit, Cochran said. Neither Chauncie nor her attorney 
attended the court proceeding, Cochran said. A full hearing on the matter was 
set for Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Cochran said he is now investigating the circumstances under which Chauncie 
obtained not only the property, but also the $65,000. He said he did not know 
how Chauncie had gained access to the money. Cochran added that he is still 
calculating the total value of Lindsay's estate. 
</P>
<P>
Until 18 months ago, Lindsay owned three houses on East 52nd Place and at least 
two commercial lots in Los Angeles. But now, records show, the only piece of 
property he owns by himself is his modest home in South-Central Los Angeles.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRUNK DRIVER GETS NEARLY 5 YEARS IN 
CYCLIST'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman with a history of drunk-driving arrests was sentenced Thursday to 
nearly five years in state prison for the death of a motorcyclist she ran down 
while driving drunk on the Golden State Freeway in Sun Valley last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, however, said that while Patricia Lee Giunta, 41, received a 
sentence of four years and eight months, she will probably only serve a little 
more than two years in custody for the Oct. 4, 1989, crash that killed David 
Jaggs, 24, and seriously injured his wife of one month, Janine, 21. 
</P>
<P>
Giunta, who was convicted last month of vehicular manslaughter, will receive 
credit for time served in county jail, where she has been since April. When she 
is transferred to state prison, her sentence will be further reduced as 
mandated by law depending on good behavior.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DORSEY HIGH WINS COUNTY MOCK TRIAL 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dorsey High School in Baldwin Hills has won the Los Angeles County Mock Trial 
championships, snatching the crown from Louisville High School in Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Students presented trial arguments in a drunk driving felony manslaughter case. 
The young "lawyers" had to argue the constitutionality of the arrest and of 
sobriety checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey will now advance to the state competition, set for April in Sacramento. 
The mock trial is sponsored by the Constitutional Rights Foundation, a 
nonprofit organization that educates the public on legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
More than 40 high schools took part in this year's competition, which was held 
at Los Angeles Superior Courthouse, with Judge Judith Chirlin presiding and a 
panel of three attorneys scoring the teams.

MENORAH MUST GO OR BE PLACED NEXT TO CHRISTMAS TREE; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: FEDERAL JUDGE'S DECISION IS BASED ON SUPREME COURT VIEW THAT SYMBOLS 
COULD BE TOGETHER IN DISPLAY OF RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE. CANDELABRUM WAS PLACED IN 
BEVERLY HILLS PUBLIC PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge ordered the city of Beverly Hills Thursday to take down a 
28-foot Hanukkah menorah or to see that it is displayed next to a comparably 
sized Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. came after the American 
Jewish Congress, four Beverly Hills residents and the American Civil Liberties 
Union asked that the Chabad organization of Hasidic Jews be required to remove 
the nine-branched candelabrum from a public park diagonally across the street 
from the Beverly Hills City Hall. The groups filed suit Monday to have the 
menorah removed. 
</P>
<P>
They argued that the display of the menorah on public property so close to the 
seat of government violated the 1st Amendment ban on the establishment of 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
Hatter ruled Thursday on a request for a temporary restraining order. However, 
the larger suit -- to decide on future displays -- is pending. A hearing is set 
for Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling Thursday, Hatter relied heavily on a 1989 decision in which the 
U.S. Supreme Court said that the Constitution would not be violated if symbols 
of different religions are exhibited next to each other as a display of 
religious tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Erected earlier this week for the eight-day Hanukkah holiday, which started 
Tuesday night, the menorah now stands alone in a stretch of parkland along busy 
Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the Supreme Court's standard, Hatter said, the menorah would 
have to be moved next to an illuminated Christmas tree one block away, or a 
Christmas tree would have to be erected next to it. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that the lights of the Christmas tree and the menorah could only 
be lit by city workers, in order to emphasize the secular nature of the 
display, and that there could be no religious ceremonies at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Chabad has scheduled a Hanukkah party there Sunday, but Rabbi Boruch Hecht, a 
leader of the group, promised that no blessings would be recited over the 
menorah. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills officials had no immediate response to the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall B. Grossman, Chabad's attorney, said that he would be glad to pay for 
the decorations required to set up a Christmas tree next to the menorah. 
</P>
<P>
He called the plaintiffs' efforts "misguided" and said there will be one more 
Christmas tree in the park. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Mirell, president of the Pacific Southwest Region of the American 
Jewish Congress, said that it is up to the Beverly Hills City Council to decide 
"whether to continue this ludicrous set of circumstances or to do what they 
should have done in the first place to prevent the display of religious objects 
on public property."

ERA OF CRIME; 
</P>
<P>
CHIEF GATES, SHERIFF BLOCK SAY THE TIDE WILL ONLY WORSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With an estimated 80,000 gang members and 15,000 police officers; with the 
annual increase in gang murders nearing 40%, and with a vast amount of the 
cocaine imported from South America coming through Los Angeles, local law 
enforcement agencies are embattled as never before. In a wide-ranging joint 
interview with Times urban affairs writer Frank Clifford, Los Angeles County 
Sheriff Sherman Block and Los Angeles Chief of Police Daryl F. Gates argue that 
the fight against crime will not be won by their agencies alone. Without more 
police officers and jails, without help from the private sector to create more 
jobs, Block and Gates hold out little hope that the community will become any 
safer in the coming decade. Block warns that without more economic opportunity, 
today's gang wars could become tomorrow's class wars. With nearly a century of 
police work between them, the two are wistful about the days when police 
officers had the time to chase down stolen bicycles. They admit that police 
officers have occasionally made serious mistakes in the face of better-armed 
and more violent criminals. But despite the shocking trends, Block and Gates 
say that law enforcement is holding its own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PROSPECT OF CLASS WARFARE 
</P>
<P>
Block: 
</P>
<P>
I think that we in law enforcement are succeeding. We are arresting more 
people. We are prosecuting more people. We are incarcerating more people. So we 
are doing our job very well. That is not the answer to the problem, because 
there is a new crop coming along all the time, and that is somebody else's 
responsibility. And they are not succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
Gates: 
</P>
<P>
We are faced with dealing with the failures . . . and it seems to be a 
continuing failure and we don't seem to learn any lessons at all from the past, 
and as a result we the police are thrust in the situation of having to deal 
with the problem. But I think we both would agree that we are not the ultimate 
answer. And I think we both would agree that (we) know what the answers are but 
we are not sure if the society is willing to do what (it needs) . . . to solve 
some of these problems. 
</P>
<P>
I would hope to have someone like Michael Milken (the junk bond king recently 
sentenced to 10 years in prison for conspiracy and securities fraud; Gates 
urged leniency in his sentencing) . . . convince the board rooms throughout 
this city, this county, this state, perhaps this nation that there (are) a lot 
of IOUs out there . . . and I would like to see him make the corporate world 
understand (that) this is not a government problem, this is everyone's problem. 
And it is particularly private industry's problem. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons that private industry runs off to Malaysia and all over the 
world is because they can't harness the labor force that they have. The labor 
force is not in tune to what they need, and vice versa. . . . 
</P>
<P>
(At one time) a guy, even though he didn't finish high school, could get a 
fairly decent job. He could support a family and kind of move into lower-middle 
class, maybe middle. . . . Today, that doesn't exist. But we have not had the 
adjustment by the private sector to fill this horrible gap. 
</P>
<P>
Block: 
</P>
<P>
There are other institutions in society that have to break this cycle. I 
believe that one of the things that needs to be done more quickly and more 
extensively than anything else is a restoration of programs such as Head Start. 
To take 2- and 3-year-olds, and I don't care what community they are in, not 
only in a high-risk community but throughout this community, throughout 
society, and begin teaching youngsters social skills and establishing a value 
system. . . . If I had the time and the resources, I would start a Head Start 
program along with other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewer: 
</P>
<P>
If it were proposed that some of the money for these programs come out of your 
budget, would you go along with that? 
</P>
<P>
Block: 
</P>
<P>
No. For a simple reason that what we are doing is essential. And I think it is 
not a case of either or. . . . While we are focusing on the next generation, we 
can't allow the current criminals in our society to prey upon the community 
unmolested. Do you think the citizens would tolerate that? Not for a minute. 
</P>
<P>
What I fear really for the future -- and I think not in the too long-term 
future -- is that we are going to experience in this community, in this 
country, a class struggle, not a racial struggle, not ethnic-based, but a class 
struggle because, as the chief said, our industry-type opportunities, (such as) 
manufacturing, assembly-line types of jobs, have moved away and we have gone 
more and more into the information economy. It requires people with education 
and significant skills. 
</P>
<P>
(For) the individuals who possess those skills, the ones who stayed in school 
and got the education, it is going to be a seller's market. They are going to 
be able to demand top dollar for their labor. There is not going to be enough 
of them. Those who do not have that skill base and that educational base, there 
are going to be few if any jobs available for them. 
</P>
<P>
Class warfare means that those who have and those who have not are going to be 
in conflict, and those who have not are going to look for scapegoats and to 
rationalize that it is the haves who are keeping them from acquiring the kinds 
of things they need. And these are basic, inherent rights, as if some giant 
conspiracy is at work to deprive them of what they are entitled to, and that 
they have a right to go out and take it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMBATTING THE GANGS 
</P>
<P>
Block: 
</P>
<P>
I think there is a misunderstanding of gangs today. You know, preying on each 
other because it is the drive-by shooting and the mass violence that gets the 
attention. These people are very busy committing other crimes -- robberies, 
burglaries, car thefts and a whole range of criminal activities so they are not 
focusing entirely on other gangs. They are in for the full spectrum of crime. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those people who are dealing drugs are small-time street dealers who 
are often dealing to support their own drug use or doing it for a few bucks, 
working for somebody else. I think (it) has been totally misstated . . . in 
various publications (that) current levels of gang violence (equate) with 
Prohibition-era of violence, where bootleggers were shooting each other. 
Somewhere between 1% and 3% of (gang) violence is related to a dispute over 
turf, drug-dealing turf. The rest is the kind of mindless violence (that occurs 
when) gangs perceive some slight. Sometimes the killings are almost 
recreational, they are attempts for notoriety and attention. . . . During 
Prohibition, gang members, traditional gangsters, worked hard to try and 
maintain a positive public image and went to church. They contributed to 
charity and attended all the fashionable events and when they did engage in an 
act of violence, it was with surgical precision so they would not outrage the 
community. These people (today) will go out and shoot into a crowd of 20 people 
you know, without any problem. They are sociopaths, they are individuals who 
have no sense of self-worth and very simply I believe that people who don't 
care about themselves certainly are not going to care about anybody else and 
that is one of our problems. 
</P>
<P>
Gates: 
</P>
<P>
Well, I think that the drugs are there and probably the gang violence would not 
occur if they weren't all on drugs. They are already, as the sheriff says, 
driven by a sociopathic mentality that kind of permeates the group, and they 
have a few beers and snort some coke and they are on their way. "Why don't we 
go out and have some fun? Let's go shoot somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Block: 
</P>
<P>
The chief has said that his department is not a large police department and it 
is not by national standards, by population and so forth, when you consider 
that in our computers that we have an excess of 80,000 identified gang members 
in this community, which means that there are more than four active gang 
members for every police officer and sheriff's officer that is on patrol in 
this community. We are not adequately staffed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Let me talk about jail. I would say that the majority of those 80,000 need 
institutionalization of some kind, perhaps not a hard-lock jail, but perhaps a 
program of intermediate sanction, a boot camp where they can get a message that 
hey, if this is the way you want to go, there is a price to pay, there are 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Gates: 
</P>
<P>
The lack of facilities you know, the controversy (over) building a prison in 
our community, in Lancaster, nobody wants it in their back yard. But I don't 
think people really realize how critical the situation is. I know they believe 
in building prisons that we have and I think we build them faster here than 
anywhere else. . . . But I looked at the data the other day on the Blue Ribbon 
Committee on Corrections. Twenty thousand are released from prison before they 
serve three months. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. Less than three months, 20,000. Forty thousand are released in 
less than six months and 60,000 are released who do less than one year. Now if 
anyone thinks that law enforcement is going to be able to get any kind of 
control over that criminal element when that is all the time they do, which is 
foolish, you can't do it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
POLICE CORRUPTION 
</P>
<P>
Interviewer: 
</P>
<P>
What happened at 39th and Dalton (an anti-drug raid in which 38 city police 
officers were disciplined for allegedly ransacking apartments and roughing up 
residents in Southwest Los Angeles)? 
</P>
<P>
Gates: 
</P>
<P>
Well, it is very simple. We had officers who were trying to address a very 
serious problem, a family there, a Hispanic family that had been the victims of 
a drive-by shooting. There were gang members and dope dealers in that area, and 
there was a lot of fear in that area so good police officers thought they were 
putting together a plan that was going to deal with that. Unfortunately, it was 
a very poorly constructed plan, and there was unfortunately very poor control 
when it was put into place. . . . (If) just one sergeant had stepped forward 
and said "knock it off," we would have never heard of 39th and Dalton. We made 
a mistake. We did a lousy job. I am the first to admit it. We disciplined a lot 
of officers because of it. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewer: 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff, last winter after the announcements of charges (against) some of your 
men came out (six deputies were convicted this week of conspiring to steal cash 
seized from drug traffickers; a seventh was convicted of lesser charges), you 
said that in 34 years (it was) the saddest day, outside of a loss of life. Is 
it becoming increasingly difficult for people in law enforcement to resist the 
kind of extraordinary temptation that drug money presents? 
</P>
<P>
Block: 
</P>
<P>
I think people in law enforcement should be above that kind of temptation. 
Certainly the opportunities and the exposure to these kinds of dollar amounts 
are greater than they ever have been, and to me a thief is a thief is a thief. 
I mean whether you take $2 out of a billfold of a drunk or whether you bring in 
or whether you take a million dollars from a major drug dealer. It is just not 
acceptable conduct for people in law enforcement. And when someone goes over 
the line, that is a terrible trauma that is inflicted not on me personally, but 
on the entire organization. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think there is any question that there was a failure of supervision. In 
fact, in the particular crew that (was) on trial, the supervisor was a part of 
the problem. You know you can devise a variety of systems but people can find 
ways to deviate from the systems. We had, and I still believe we have in place, 
a very good system on how those dollars were taken, transported and recorded 
and the whole bit. But if individuals that were together at the moment of 
seizure decide to take a portion of that money and not place it in the 
container that will be sealed, that is serial-numbered, that can't be opened by 
anyone and the whole bit. You know, there is not much you can do.

RECALLING A SIMPLER TIME 
</P>
<P>
Gates:

<P>
I went out last Saturday. I guess it was last Saturday night when one of my 
sergeants was shot in the leg. And as I was talking to him, and asking what 
happened: Well, we got a call, shots fired at a party and we get these calls 
all the time. . . . (He was) confronted with a couple of people, actually two 
groups, two parties who crossed the alley from one another and were shooting at 
one another and he walked into it and got shot in the leg and shot a suspect in 
the process. The point is that that is the kind of society and that is the kind 
of situation that police officers and sheriff's deputies are walking into all 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
I am operating in the mode where the uniform and the badge meant something and 
that people paid attention to that and respected it, and there weren't that 
many guns on the street and people were very adverse to shooting at a police 
officer. That situation doesn't exist today. 
</P>
<P>
Block: 
</P>
<P>
What I see about being most different from when I was working the streets 30 
years ago or more was that there was a pretty well-defined line of demarcation 
between who the good guys were and who the bad guys were, and every cop on the 
street was pretty well able to tell and prepare themselves to deal with the 
situation knowing that hey, these were good guys, and these were bad guys. 
Drugs, more than anything else, has blurred that line and today, you just don't 
know what to expect. So, oftentimes, officers will approach a vehicle with a 
gun drawn, and pretty soon you receive a letter or a phone call from this 
law-abiding citizen who felt threatened by the fact that the officer approached 
with a gun drawn. The officer could very well approach that same car and end up 
dead, and this is the difficult task out there to them. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewer: 
</P>
<P>
Can people expect the same service, the same level of promptness in response 
today that they did when you were young police officers in this community? 
People who live in Los Angeles are just going to have to get used to the fact 
that this is a rougher town and they can't go to the police as often as they 
might like, is this true? 
</P>
<P>
Gates: 
</P>
<P>
If your bicycle was stolen . . . if nothing else, we gave you a little tender 
loving care. And I think you deserve it, and I think people deserve it. And not 
only that, when we were doing that we got more information. We send, believe it 
or not, we send a car on about 28% of the calls that we receive for service, 
about 28% and that in my judgment is really a shame. We were at one time up to 
about 33% to 35%. Going back when I began in the Police Department we were 
probably sending units on 80% of the calls. 
</P>
<P>
Block: 
</P>
<P>
What I see is the greatest difficulty today is with technology, you know, with 
the ability to take reports over the telephone, with the communications system 
that allows us to get information more rapidly with helicopters and with all of 
the things that we've got, we have moved further and further away from our 
ability, as the chief stated, that can provide a little tender loving care, to 
have the luxury of interacting with people in a more personal nature, and I 
think that is a component of law enforcement that has been lost. . . . You just 
don't have the luxury of time that we used to have.

OXY BLACK SEA PLANT IS NOW IN VOTERS' HANDS 
</P>

GRIGORYEVKA, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Occidental Petroleum Corp. signed a contract in 1973 to build a huge 
fertilizer plant and port on the Black Sea, company Chairman Armand Hammer, the 
longtime advocate of closer Soviet-American ties who died this week, called the 
gigantic complex "the crowning achievement of our relations with the Soviet 
Union." 
</P>
<P>
But, in one of the Soviet Union's first referendums on an environmental issue, 
residents of the southern Ukrainian city of Odessa will vote Sunday on whether 
to close down parts of the project as a threat to the local population. 
</P>
<P>
Odessa, with a population of more than 1 million, is 10 miles from the plant. 
Environmental activists want to close what the city council calls the plant's 
"most dangerous facilities," which include four massive tanks for storing 
ammonia and equipment for pumping it aboard ships. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and factory managers have been sparring on television and in 
the press to sway public opinion in one of the Soviet Union's first referendums 
on an environmental issue. 
</P>
<P>
The potential danger of an accident, environmentalists say, is the greatest 
threat, because ammonia explodes at a low temperature and then forms a cloud, 
which can be blown by wind over populated areas. Inhaled, ammonia can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
"A large accident, explosion or atmospheric release of ammonia could be tragic 
for the city and nearby populated areas," a state commission of scientists 
wrote about the chemical complex in a report on pollution in Odessa. 
</P>
<P>
But the daily expulsion of pollutants into the air and sea are also harmful, 
according to the report, which called the factory one of the "most dangerous" 
enterprises in Odessa. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 89% of the ammonia and a quarter of the nitrogen dioxide in Odessa's 
highly polluted air comes from the plant, according to the report, commissioned 
by the Soviet and Ukrainian governments and published earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Odessa Portside Factory, however, contend their enterprise is 
responsible for only 1% of Odessa's air pollution and does not significantly 
pollute the water. They also say that in the event of an accident, any ammonia 
cloud would quickly disperse and never reach the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Grigoryevka complex -- which also processes ammonia into urea, a chemical 
used in fertilizers and plastics manufacture -- was a key part of a $20 
billion, long-term fertilizer agreement that Los Angeles-based Occidental made 
with the Soviet Union during the first easing of tensions between Moscow and 
the United States in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The fertilizer complex has the largest ammonia storage capacity in the world 
and is supplied by a 1,488-mile pipeline, which originates in the industrial 
Volga River city of Togliatti. 
</P>
<P>
Factory workers remember the plant's opening day in August, 1978, as a 
celebration of modern technology and the achievements of the Soviet system. In 
his keynote address, Hammer called the project "an example of what can be done 
when men of reason and good will work together to accomplish a common goal." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a time of great patriotism," said Pyotr D. Krutogolov, who has worked 
at the factory since before it was opened. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or 
political openness, has given birth to an environmental movement, which has 
changed strikingly the public opinion about the factory and Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
"Hammer is an anti-hero here," said Alfred Tsykalo, a chemist, ecologist and 
member of the Odessa city council. "Many people feel resentful that, in spite 
of the fact that Hammer's ancestors are from this area, he put his huge, 
harmful factory here so he could make a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Like factory officials across the country, the Grigoryevka managers have been 
challenged by angry neighbors and environmentalists with placards in their 
hands and new Soviet democracy to back up their demands. 
</P>
<P>
The grass-roots drive against the factory started after a foreign ship spilled 
ammonia near the port on Sept. 1, 1988, creating a cloud that hung over the 
village of Novy Belyary. 
</P>
<P>
"I was riding toward the village on my bicycle and the smell of ammonia kept 
getting stronger and stronger," Anatoly T. Lemeshkin, a village resident, 
recalled. "I went straight to the center of the village where the children 
play, and everyone was crying and screaming." 
</P>
<P>
Villagers complain that they suffer from asthma, severe headaches, high blood 
pressure and early death by stroke and that their children are always ill. 
</P>
<P>
Factory managers have grudgingly agreed to pay to move the 6,000 people from 
Novy Belyary and two other villages to high-rise apartments in cleaner areas. 
But the resettlement program is going slowly, because of a lack of construction 
materials and labor. Many villagers say they cannot move, because they cannot 
adjust to life without their own land. 
</P>
<P>
Leonid P. Gnachuk, the captain of Grigoryevka port, has joined the 
environmental battle with articles about ecological problems in local 
newspapers. Gnachuk argues that the plant should not have been built here at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious a chemical factory should never have been built here so close to 
the sea," he said. "The danger of an explosion and harm to the people and the 
environment is too large." 
</P>
<P>
During the summer of 1989, protests by Novy Belyary residents prevented factory 
managers from using a new mooring designed for loading phosphates in the port. 
</P>
<P>
But residents said they have no hope for further victories because the factory 
-- whose exports, officials claim, earn the equivalent of $1.26 billion -- is 
too valuable to the government. "They will never close the factory because it 
earns hard currency," Lemeshkin said. "In our country's situation, hard 
currency is worth more than human lives."

THE R WORD? RODEO, DAHLING; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: JUDGING BY ONE DAY'S BUSINESS, A PRICEY SHOP ON THE EXCLUSIVE 
BEVERLY HILLS STREET NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT SLOW SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a back corner of the Theodore women's shop on Rodeo Drive -- after you pass 
the $6,000 cat suit, the $550 cashmere sweaters and the $1,000-plus sequined 
party dresses -- there's a simple advertising display for the store's own line 
of fragrances. 
</P>
<P>
There's no description of the merchandise, just one image-laden sentence of 
advertising copy: "I always get what I want." 
</P>
<P>
That line also could be the motto of many of the people who shop at Theodore in 
Beverly Hills. "Our customer," said owner Herbert Fink, "is a with-it person 
who is on the go." 
</P>
<P>
"She's an important person," he added, "who may run a movie studio." 
</P>
<P>
When the holiday shopping season arrives, these important, with-it people who 
always get what they want seem to want even more. At least, they buy more. 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, a recession appears under way, and many merchants this 
holiday season are doing everything but using a hook to pull wary customers 
into their stores. But things are done differently on Rodeo Drive, where a 
Times reporter spent one day this week gauging the rhythms of commerce at the 
Theodore boutique. 
</P>
<P>
Business was steady at Theodore that day, apparently better than it's been at 
nearby competitors. Fink said holiday sales at the store, one of his 10 fashion 
shops in Southern California, are up about 10% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Customers are buying fewer items, Fink said, but generally they are snapping up 
the more expensive ones. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there are markdowns, but these are Beverly Hills markdowns. 
</P>
<P>
On the "40% off" rack, the price of a leather coat was slashed from $3,100 to a 
rock-bottom $2,170, a fake-fur coat was reduced from $980 to $588 and a suit 
was marked down from $1,200 to $720. 
</P>
<P>
The price cuts have come a couple weeks earlier this year than usual, in 
response to competition from Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and others. Even 
if Theodore shoppers typically have big money to spend, "everybody loves a 
bargain," Fink said. 
</P>
<P>
And some customers -- call them the untrendy minority -- clearly do fret over 
prices. An elderly man who came in to buy a sweater and leggings as a present 
waved his hand and left, seemingly in disgust, after being told the total came 
to $805.96. 
</P>
<P>
Salesperson Dawn Ortega, a native Texan who started working at Theodore six 
months ago, was startled. "We've had people come in to pick up something that 
they thought was $140 when it was really $1,400, but that doesn't happen 
often," she said. "Most of our customers aren't that price conscious." 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, customers appear to be swayed more by fashion and quality. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at prices, but I'm not running around with coupons," said Lianne 
Barnes, a knitwear designer with her own firm in Santa Monica who stops at 
Theodore from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's very well made, I don't mind spending money on it." 
</P>
<P>
A woman, looking at a pair of blue jeans, mentioned the P word. 
</P>
<P>
It's $165, the saleswoman reported. "Not bad," the customer replied. Not so, 
said her female companion, a tall, glamorous blonde clad in black. "Actually, 
that's high for jeans," the friend said softly. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, it was a very low-key day -- even after actress Joan Van Ark 
made a quiet entrance. She said she wanted a patent leather belt. Told that 
there were none, Van Ark said "thank you" and left. 
</P>
<P>
The sales clerks played it L.A.-cool, aside from exchanging glances and a 
whisper after Van Ark departed. Margie Ketting, a 25-year-old sales clerk, 
explained that she often sees celebrities at work and when she goes out to the 
club scene. 
</P>
<P>
"You're with them all the time. They're nice people," Ketting confided. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of a Times photographer and reporter didn't whip up any 
excitement, either. One shopper after another turned down the opportunity to be 
interviewed. "Who are these people?" one regular asked. 
</P>
<P>
Fink explained that his typical customer "doesn't have time to monkey around," 
and that some might be worried that their personal manager, husband or 
boyfriend would be angry if the news got out that they were out shopping on 
Rodeo again. 
</P>
<P>
"Shopping is a very private thing. It's like going to your psychiatrist," he 
quipped. 
</P>
<P>
As for that $6,000 rainbow cat suit on display at the entrance -- a one-piece 
body suit covered with small sequins in a variety of colors -- it evoked mixed 
reactions. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of stars come in and try it on," said store manager Susan 
Sanders. "It'll sell." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was impressed. Later in the day, an elegant-looking woman in a red 
blazer took a step into the store, pointed out the suit to her male companion, 
giggled and walked out. 
</P>
<P>
And not all of the sales pitches succeeded. A sales clerk told a bespectacled, 
conservatively dressed shopper who appeared to be in her 60s or 70s that "you'd 
look great in these sweats." The shopper replied, "I'm too fat." End of sales 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how rich most of the customers are, many would be considered 
undernourished if they lived in Milwaukee. "You can always tell the girls who 
look at Theodore," said Fink, 67, a longtime Beverly Hills retailer who heads 
the Rodeo Drive Committee, a merchants group. 
</P>
<P>
"They wear black. Very tight pants. Anorexic." 
</P>
<P>
These customers also can be demanding and aloof. They have been known to pull 
in front of the store in their cars and bang on their horns for a salesperson 
to come out. Others come in and pace through the store toting their dogs or 
talking into their pocket-size cellular telephones. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the sales staff -- all women, mostly in their 20s -- say they like the 
respect they get from their better customers. And one of them, Lisa Ross, 23, 
recently got a nice surprise. "I've got the best customer in the world," Ross 
said. "She sent me flowers and a fruit basket!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>

NOVEMBER'S RETAIL SALES DECLINE 0.1%, PROVING SHOPPERS FEEL PINCHED; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE $151.6 BILLION THAT BUYERS SPENT WAS 'A RECESSION-TYPE NUMBER,' 
ONE ANALYST SAYS. BUT THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT FIGURES WERE BETTER THAN MANY 
EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a fresh sign of how tight holiday shoppers' pocketbooks have gotten, the 
federal government reported Thursday that retail sales fell 0.1% in November 
from the month before. 
</P>
<P>
The retail sales total, at a seasonally adjusted $151.6 billion, was up 3.4% 
from weak November, 1989, results. But with inflation running at more than 6% 
this year, it means that most merchants are doing less -- or no more -- 
business than in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not what a number of retailers were looking for, but we have to 
understand that we're probably in a recession," said Rosalind Wells, chief 
economist of the National Retail Federation trade group. She called the sales 
total "a recession-type number." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Commerce Department figures were better than many economists 
expected, given the weak sales reports released by major retailers last week. A 
Dow Jones survey had forecast a monthly decline of 0.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Also, car sales -- which depressed the November retail sales total -- staged a 
big, though possibly misleading, rebound in early December, auto makers 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The figures, however, did little to change the growing opinion that the economy 
has sunk into a recession and that consumers have grown increasingly cautious. 
Retailing analysts predicted that department stores and specialty shops will 
enjoy a surge of business in the days before Christmas, but not enough to turn 
around what so far has been a dismal holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
They also said that, to drum up business, more retailers will follow such 
giants as Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and Toys R Us in offering more and deeper 
price cuts on holiday merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
The weak figures reported by the Commerce Department were blamed on worries 
about the Persian Gulf crisis, rising unemployment, declining consumer 
confidence and rising energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Americans are laying out so much more money at the gas pump and on home 
heating oil that their discretionary buying power is substantially reduced," 
said Kurt Barnard, publisher of the Retail Marketing Report newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a strong feeling across the country that it's more prudent so save 
financial resources than to spend them." 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to buy less than they did in the past year, and they'll spend 
less on what they will buy," Barnard added. 
</P>
<P>
One of the likely results: more retailing bankruptcies, said Carl Steidtmann, 
chief economist for the retail consulting firm Management Horizons. Along with 
the companies burdened with junk bond debts, he said, the list of failures 
likely will include retail chains that simply can no longer make enough money 
to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
The retail sales drop, following a revised 0.2% gain in October, was the first 
monthly decline since May. 
</P>
<P>
Among the few comparatively bright spots was the apparel specialty store 
category, where sales were up 0.8% from October and 2.3% -- before accounting 
for inflation -- from a year ago. Gasoline dealer sales climbed 0.7% from 
October and 21.6% from a year earlier, largely as a result of increased prices 
amid the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Drugstore sales also climbed, up 0.2% from October and 8.4% from November, 
1989. Furniture sales rose 0.3% from October, but were down 1.7% from last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the weakness came at home improvement stores, where seasonally adjusted 
sales totals were down 2.6% from October and 5.2% from a year ago. At 
department stores, seasonally adjusted sales fell 0.2% from October but rose 
1.1% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Auto sales, a major component of the government figures, were down 1.3% from 
the month before and little changed from a year ago. Eliminating the auto sales 
category, retail sales in November posted a 0.2% gain from October and a 4.3% 
increase from November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the 10 companies producing cars and trucks in the United States 
reported a 22.3% sales increase during the first 10 days of December.

JUDGE RULES ASHTON-TATE'S DBASE SOFTWARE COPYRIGHTS ARE INVALID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge shocked the software industry Thursday, ruling that Ashton-Tate 
Corp.'s copyrights on its top-selling dBase line of personal computer programs 
are invalid because the company repeatedly failed to disclose the product's 
intellectual origins. 
</P>
<P>
If the ruling is not overturned, it could cause chaos to Ashton-Tate's business 
by giving competitors full rights to copy the firm's primary product. But 
company executives and software industry analysts said they expect the ruling 
to be overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling doesn't necessarily threaten other firms' software products, 
analysts said. However, it does put all software publishers on notice to pay 
strict attention to the origins of the work they claim as their own. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter in Los Angeles said 
Ashton-Tate "knowingly and with an intent to deceive," failed to disclose that 
its dBase programs stemmed from a publicly available software program created 
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 1in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
This "inequitable conduct," Hatter ruled, invalidated all the copyrights issued 
for the dBase programs, a series of database management software whose sales 
account for more than 60% of the Torrance-based company's annual revenue and 
have made the firm the nation's fourth-largest PC software publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate executives, clearly surprised by the ruling, vowed to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the court ruling is in error and we are confident that our 
copyrights are valid," said William P. Lyons, Ashton-Tate's chief executive. 
"There was no intention to mislead." 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said the company did not disclose the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
connection because the attorney who filed the original copyright application in 
1983 was unaware of it. Subsequent copyright filings for new dBase programs, 
company officers said, were simply copied from the first. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons maintained that the ruling would have little immediate impact on sales by 
the company, which has been battling -- with some success -- in recent months 
to recover from a series of blunders two years ago that caused losses of more 
than $50 million and severe erosion of its market share to hard-charging 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Nycum, a Palo Alto attorney specializing in intellectual property issues, 
said that, although other copyright holders have been similarly punished in the 
past, Hatter's ruling is the first time a judge has stripped a software 
publisher of its copyrights for failing to disclose the intellectual origins of 
its work. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the ruling is sweeping," Nycum acknowledged. "But the lesson here is that 
people have to realize how serious it is to be incorrect in filing these 
copyright applications. Many times, software companies just don't research the 
origin of what they buy from outsiders and publish as their own." 
</P>
<P>
Even if it is successfully appealed, Nycum said, the ruling will prompt 
software publishers to "make sure their own houses are in order." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling resulted from a copyright infringement lawsuit filed two years ago 
by Ashton-Tate against two competitors for selling database management software 
that allegedly copied the "form of expression" and "novel look and feel" of 
dBase. 
</P>
<P>
One of the defendants, Fox Software of Perrysburg, Ohio, asked that the suit be 
dismissed because Ashton-Tate had repeatedly failed to disclose on its 
copyright applications that dBase was derived from JPLDIS, a software program 
for managing huge databases on mainframe computers, developed at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate bought the rights to the original dBase program in 1981 from C. 
Wayne Ratliff, a former JPL engineer, and developed the top-selling program 
from it. According to company lore, Ratliff originally wrote the program on his 
own time to collect, sort and manage the office football pool. 
</P>
<P>
A JPL spokesman said Thursday that the original dBase program is "the same as 
JPLDIS, only modified for the personal computer." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts agreed and said the fact was hardly a secret in the software industry. 
"Everyone knew that," said Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of Softletter, an industry 
newsletter in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were trying to hide it, they did a damn poor job," added Richard 
Shaffer, an industry analyst in New York. 
</P>
<P>
But Ashton-Tate executives said they did not tell the U.S. Copyright Office 
about the JPL connection until last month, after Fox raised the issue in the 
lawsuit. The company said it disclosed the information then to show Fox that 
the JPL connection would not matter to the Copyright Office. 
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that JPLDIS is not an underlying work for dBase," said Stanley 
Witlow, Ashton-Tate's general counsel. "There was no intent to defraud." 
</P>
<P>
Witlow said dBase does not contain any lines of code similar to JPLDIS. 
Further, he said, the original program was written for a mainframe computer, 
but dBase is strictly meant to be used on a personal computer.

German Bank Gets Treasury Dealership: Germany's Deutsche Bank was named a 
primary dealer of U.S. government securities by the New York Federal Reserve 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed, which acts as fiscal agent for the Treasury, retains a few dozen key 
securities firms to act as lead dealers in government bonds. Some U.S. 
securities firms recently have viewed primary dealer status as increasingly 
costly in comparison to the benefits. But Deutsche Bank said it views the role 
as a way to open doors in the U.S. securities business.

Toyota to Change Way It Reports Sales: The Japanese auto maker broke with 
industry tradition and said it would start reporting sales of both its imported 
and U.S.-built cars and trucks every 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
If other Japanese-based firms follow suit, it will mark a small victory for 
Chrysler. The U.S. auto firm recently said that it would quit reporting sales 
every 10 days, partly in protest against the Japanese practice of reporting 
only the fast-rising sales of its U.S.-built vehicles and omitting the weaker 
import sales until month's end. Chrysler had no immediate comment.

Brokers Accused of Penny Stock Fraud: Federal regulators charged 10 New 
York-area brokers with bilking investors of about $1.4 million through 
fraudulent penny stock sales, in a case that names only the securities salesmen 
and not their firms. A civil lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court said the 
brokers conducted illegal trading at several firms using techniques that 
included pressuring investors to buy stock, refusing to let them sell and 
promising that prices would rise. The Securities and Exchange Commission 
complaint alleges that the brokers made more than $270,000 in commissions from 
60 defrauded customers and seeks recovery of all ill-gotten gains.

PEOPLE: SCHULHOF IS NEW CBS RECORDS CHAIRMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER , From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that further strengthens Sony Corp.'s control over its CBS Records 
unit, the Japanese consumer electronics giant has appointed its top U.S. 
executive, Michael P. Schulhof, chairman of the record label, effective Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Schulhof, currently vice chairman of Sony U.S.A., had been widely rumored to 
take the helm at CBS Records after the departure in September of Walter R. 
Yetnikoff, the volatile chief executive of the record company. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which which operates the Columbia, Epic, WTG and Sony Classical 
labels, will be renamed Sony Music Entertainment Inc. on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Schulhof, 48, spearheaded Sony's $2-billion purchase of CBS Records in 1988 and 
is considered one of Sony Chairman Akio Morita's most trusted lieutenants. 
</P>
<P>
Schulhof is the only U.S. citizen serving on Sony Corp.'s 15-member board and 
is said to be one of the few Americans regularly involved in high-level 
decision making at a major Japanese company. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Sony Corp. president Norio Ohga serves as chairman of CBS Records. 
But Ohga said "it has become increasingly difficult for me to dedicate 
sufficient time to Sony Music Entertainment's operations" because of the growth 
of the music unit and demands on his time from Sony Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In his new role as chairman of CBS Records, Schulhof "will be active" in daily 
management "and be a part of any major decisions," said Sony U.S.A. spokesman 
Robert Zito. However, Schulhof will keep his current title and managing Sony 
U.S.A. will remain a responsibility, Zito said. JUBE SHIVER

<P>
Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s board Thursday reaffirmed its earlier vote to name 
President Ray R. Irani chairman and chief executive to replace Armand Hammer, 
who died Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The board also voted to name Dale R. Laurance, Irani's longtime lieutenant, to 
the board seat vacated by Hammer and to promote Laurance to the new post of 
senior operating officer from executive vice president of operations. 
</P>
<P>
Irani, 55, brought Laurance, 45, with him to Occidental in 1983 from Olin 
Corp., where Irani was president and Laurance was his special assistant. 
</P>
<P>
During Hammer's last years, Irani and Laurance, both trained in the chemical 
business, worked closely together buying up chemical properties and 
streamlining Occidental into an integrated petrochemical firm, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted in the company's Westwood headquarters after a private memorial 
service for Hammer at the nearby Westwood Memorial Park. It was the board's 
first meeting since Hammer's death.

NCR WILL WOO BIG HOLDERS IN BID TO DEFEAT AT&amp;T OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NCR Corp. said Thursday that its top executives will be meeting soon with 
representatives of the firm's major institutional shareholders to build support 
for their rejection of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's $6.1-billion 
hostile takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
NCR's board also met Thursday but issued no statement. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said the board will respond to AT&amp;T's $90-per-share 
tender offer by Dec. 19, the legal deadline. 
</P>
<P>
NCR's aim is to get its institutional holders -- who NCR officials claim own 
about 60% of the firm's stock -- to back the company's defiance of AT&amp;T's 
bid and defeat any proxy fight that AT&amp;T might trigger. 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said, NCR has a hard sell. "To an NCR shareholder, the 
AT&amp;T offer has got to look very good," said Craig Ellis, an analyst at C. 
J. Lawrence Inc. in New York. "The NCR board has got to have a plan to come up 
with something better if they expect their shareholders to back them."

Bergen Brunswig Corp. of Orange said Thursday it is exploring the possible 
acquisition of FoxMeyer Corp., one of its biggest competitors in the drug 
distribution business. The move would make Bergen nearly the size of McKesson 
Corp. of San Francisco, the nation's largest drug wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas-based FoxMeyer is the No. 3 pharmaceutical wholesaler. Bergen, the 
second-largest, with the acquisition would boost its pharmaceutical sales from 
$3.9 billion to $6.3 billion annually. It would also strengthen Bergen's 
presence in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts cautioned, however, that a merger between the two large distributors 
would likely receive careful scrutiny by federal antitrust regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen officials said the company earlier this week sent a letter to National 
Intergroup Inc. of Pittsburgh, FoxMeyer's parent firm, expressing interest in 
the acquisition. The letter was in response to a request from investment 
bankers for National Intergroup Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen officials stressed that the letter was not an offer to buy. Robert E. 
Martini, Bergen's president and chief executive, said his company hopes "to 
engage in serious discussions with FoxMeyer, and to make a thorough due 
diligence investigation so that we can make a meaningful offer." He said there 
is "no assurance" that an offer would be made. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, National Intergroup said it has not decided whether to sell 
FoxMeyer, but is testing the waters to see what price it might fetch. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Ellspermann, National Intergroup's vice president of administration, said 
the company announced in August that it would entertain offers. "Bergen is one 
of several companies who have expressed an interest and we will see what 
develops," he said. 
</P>
<P>
FoxMeyer distributes pharmaceutical products in about 30 states, concentrating 
in the Midwest, a region in which Bergen is comparatively weak, said Bob King, 
FoxMeyer's chief executive.

'EURYDICE': A WALTZ ON THE WILD SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some theatrical pieces are like road maps. They show you exactly where you're 
going as you go. Others project you like a missile on a course you can tell 
little about. In such cases, it is usually best to let yourself go along for 
the ride and check out the map later. With any luck, it'll give you some idea 
of where you've been. 
</P>
<P>
So it is with Reza Abdoh's "The Hip-Hop Waltz of Eurydice" which opened 
Wednesday at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. A prerequisite is that you float 
along with the piece, not searching too deeply for meaning and especially not 
for logic. If you're game, if you're open to seeming and actual incoherence and 
chaos, if you can take nudity and strong, often raw, but almost always striking 
language and imagery, the completed journey will be staggering if not always as 
illuminating as Abdoh might like. Many of his symbols, analogies, references 
and cross-references remain private, caught in the undertow of his own River 
Styx -- his brooding creative juices. 
</P>
<P>
The pleasures (for some they will remain problems) are overwhelmingly visual. 
The characters are androgynous or aberrant. The acting and performing is 
superior. In the case of Alan Mandell as the puppetmaster of this menacing 
underworld, a sleazy blimp with a face full of warts, it is exceptional. The 
video projections by Adam Soch are -- as they should be -- disturbing and 
remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
Sets, costumes, makeup, sound, score and choreography unite under Abdoh's 
unblinking eye to reflect his abstruse but insistently single-minded vision. 
There is a there there, and it is reached not through the mind but through the 
senses. Anyone who appreciated Abdoh's "Minamata" at this theater last year 
will find "Hip-Hop" to be at once new and familiar territory. 
</P>
<P>
And just as seductive and impenetrable. The legend of Orpheus and Eurydice is 
buried very deep within the folds of this performance piece. The program offers 
subdivisions that acknowledge the legend. (Orpheus' Nightmare, Murder of 
Eurydice, Passage Through the Elysian Sea, the Underworld). But were it not for 
that, the title and the recurring tug of love and war between Tommy/Orpheus 
(Julia Mengers) and Dora Lee/Eurydice (Tom Fitzpatrick) -- the genders are 
intentionally reversed -- it would remain unrecognizable. The Captain could be 
any boss, authority figure, prison warden or tyrant. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the events that unravel on Timian Alsaker's sullied set -- a dreary, 
water-stained, high-ceilinged cell with a bed and what is by turns a window and 
a video screen -- communicate effortless menace. 
</P>
<P>
Props roll in and out or drop from the grid. They range from oversized 
phalluses to food and a motorcycle, from instruments of torture to musical 
instruments (including the staff and gourd, attributes of pilgrim saints). 
</P>
<P>
By far the most compelling visions occur on video, however, from 
Orpheus/Tommy's frantic motorcycle race on a highway of death, to exploding 
Statues of Liberty, the decapitation of animals, the torture of people and 
political superimpositions that send potent anti-censorship messages -- 
including maggots that eat away at a portrait of Jesse Helms and a naked 
dancing male body attached to the head of President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Not for the faint of heart. 
</P>
<P>
A program note suggests that "Hip-Hop" is the offshoot of an actual nightmare: 
"Abdoh visualized an Orwellian society in the 21st Century where sex is 
punished by death. He heard a monstrous vice cop scream at a married couple 
named Orpheus and Eurydice, 'We're gonna bore desire right out of you.' " This 
is now a line in the piece. 
</P>
<P>
Among his influences are Rilke's "Sonnets to Orpheus," the movie "Blood Feast," 
Japanese Kabuki, Brazilian capoeira (a martial dance), Jasper Johns, Marcel 
Duchamp, Francis Bacon, Virgil, Antonin Artaud, Bertolt Brecht, Jean Cocteau, 
and Karl and Groucho Marx. Eclectic hardly describes it. Unlisted but certainly 
also present is Hieronymous Bosch. 
</P>
<P>
There is a waltz. There is paradox. God, by any definition, is prominently 
invoked and sometimes repudiated. A kind of holy irreverence permeates the 
language. A dragon, symbol of Satan, is slain. A line recurs: "The place we rip 
open again and again that always heals, that's God" (Rilke). 
</P>
<P>
The final pastoral scene, intensely reminiscent of the one in "Minamata," 
exudes a disturbing kind of peace that slowly degenerates into an internal 
landscape of desolation, abandonment and fear. 
</P>
<P>
Puzzling, fragmented, hard-edged and brilliant as a diamond, "Hip-Hop" cannot 
be dismissed any more than "Minamata" could. It is enormously skillfull. Yet 
for all its amorphous genius, it exacts more admiration than passion. Perhaps 
that is a reflection of the world we live in. Or will live in. To quote another 
influence, the futurist J.G. Ballard, "In a completely sane world, madness is 
the only freedom." Whatever "Hip-Hop" is, it does not easily let you go.

MORNING REPORT: MADONNA CHALLENGES VANILLA ICE

Vanilla Ice, who's owned the No. 1 spot on the Billboard chart for two months, 
is being challenged by Madonna. Her "Immaculate Collection" moved up two 
notches to No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Greatest-hits collections rarely crack the Top Five, but this one may even make 
No. 1. The big attraction is one of the two new tracks, "Justify My Love," 
which is No. 2 on the pop singles chart. Debbie Gibson's "Anything Is Possible" 
(No. 46) is on its way down -- peaking at No. 41 -- after one month on the 
chart. Edie Brickell's "Ghost of a Dog" (No. 47) shot up to No. 32 in its first 
two weeks but has been declining since. 
</P>
<P>
* The Simpsons may be singing the blues about not being able to top "The Cosby 
Show" in their Thursday-night ratings battle. But they're singing a different 
kind of blues -- and their fans seem to like it. "The Simpsons Sing the Blues" 
debuted at No. 42.

The board split its best actor award between Robin Williams and Robert De Niro 
for their co-starring roles in the upcoming film "Awakenings," while Mia Farrow 
was named best actress for "Alice," Woody Allen's Christmas Day release. Joe 
Pesci won as best supporting actor for "GoodFellas" and Winona Ryder was named 
best supporting actress for "Mermaids." France's "Cyrano de Bergerac" won as

Scorsese Honored: Director Martin Scorsese will be the sixth recipient of the 
American Cinematheque Award at the Cinematheque's annual "Moving Picture Ball" 
on March 22 in Los Angeles -- three days before the Academy Awards. Reached on 
location in Florida where he is shooting "Cape Fear," Scorsese said he is 
pleased at the honor, "especially since it is for the benefit of the 
Cinematheque," a cause he has long supported. Cinematheque chairman Sydney 
Pollack said the organization seeks to build a film complex in Hollywood near 
Mann's Chinese Theater as part of a redevelopment program. CLAUDIA PUIG

To Be or Not to Be: Patrick Stewart, who stars on television's "Star Trek: The 
Next Generation," will begin to direct a series of 10-week professional actor's 
workshops of Shakespearean plays Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Stewart, an associate artist of the Royal Shakespeare Company for 
25 years, hopes to produce the Bard's plays in Los Angeles. "My goal is to have 
a company which would be specifically a Shakespearean company," said Stewart. 
The weekly workshops will be at Paramount Studios. CLAUDIA PUIG

'KILL-OFF' LOSES ITS LIFE TO SERIOUSNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If excessive elaboration can kill a joke, excessive reverence can hurt a good, 
low-down story. In a way, that's what happens to "The Kill-Off" (Monica 
4-Plex). 
</P>
<P>
It's another Jim Thompson-derived movie, adapted from a terrifically grim 
little 1957 thriller. It has another of Thompson's memorably unsavory 
populations, growling and prowling through another brisk, dark saga of amoral 
cross-purposes, messy murder and the twisty stings of lust and greed. 
</P>
<P>
Superficially, it's a mean story about mostly mean people: bullies, drug 
addicts, bar people, thieves, strippers and blackmailers, in a disheveled 
little New Jersey vacation town just north of Asbury Park. All these messed-up 
lives, which coalesce around a vicious, bed-ridden old gossip named Luane 
Devore (Loretta Gross), are never prettied or brushed up. 
</P>
<P>
Writer-director Maggie Greenwald doesn't condescend to Thompson. She takes him 
seriously, understands that there is a tough but humanistic vision boiling 
under the bleak, hard surface: the hard-nosed, laconic chatter, the soured 
machismo. But maybe she "understands" it too well. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, the ultimate example of a writer who concealed his art, is now 
routinely adapted by filmmakers who wear their art, and the writer's vaunted 
nihilism, on their sleeves. Sometimes that makes for good movies, like Bertrand 
Tavernier's "Coup de Torchon" (from "Pop. 1,280") and Stephen Frears' "The 
Grifters." But Greenwald obviously wants to give us Thompson straight up. And, 
if that's true, her shot glasses are too shiny, her bar is too bare and no one 
looks drunk enough. 
</P>
<P>
The movie doesn't wash us in the creamy lighting and flash stylistics of "After 
Dark, My Sweet" or "The Grifters," but it doesn't sneak up on us either. It's 
low-budget, done for about $1 million, but its terseness is studied, forced. 
Most of the interiors are staged on obvious, underdressed, nearly windowless 
sets, as if Greenwald was doing "The Iceman Cometh" -- a slogging, 
well-intentioned, off-Broadway production of it -- with the characters swimming 
in and out of the careful, shadowy compositions and studiously spacing out all 
their lines, pumping them up portentously and letting them echo in the dead 
air. 
</P>
<P>
There is a nice, grungy, tamped down feel to parts of "The Kill-Off." But I 
don't think it's either a good movie or a good approximation of the novel. It 
doesn't hurt, really, that Greenwald doesn't try to translate Thompson's flashy 
technical experiment here: He told the story, as William Faulkner did in "As I 
Lay Dying," in a series of dovetailing subjective narratives from a dozen 
characters. But she sacrifices the tautness of the structure and doesn't offer 
anything very interesting to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kill-Off" (rated R, for sex, language and violence) isn't a negligible 
movie. Greenwald is obviously an intelligent filmmaker. She has assembled a 
good cast of unknowns: Steve Monroe, as affable would-be wife-killer Ralph, and 
Andrew Lee Barrett and Jordan Fox, as a strung-out couple, stand out 
particularly. And, together with ex-U2 cameraman Declan Quinn, she has given 
this movie a nice, seedy, stylized look. But she hasn't given it any life. 
</P>
<P>
And, without the illusion of spontaneity, Thompson's fatalism becomes 
redundant. No one would ever mistake this movie for a Gold Medal Original, spun 
right off a '50s drugstore rack, and that's probably what's wrong with it.

FILM-FEST SHENANIGANS IN 'SCREENINGS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who has ever attended or participated in a film festival should 
experience smiles and chuckles of recognition upon seeing the sly, sharply 
observant Italian comedy "Private Screenings," which opens today at the Monica 
4-Plex with, aptly enough, a private screening sponsored by That's Sicily, a 
tourism organization which is distributing the film. (Regular runs start 
Saturday.) 
</P>
<P>
"Private Screenings" is the work of three young filmmakers, Ninni Bruschetta, 
Francesco Calogero and Donald Ranvaud, who really know the chaotic 
film-festival territory. They don't miss a thing: temperamental stars, prints 
that don't arrive, snooty discos that cash in on the festival, fatuous press 
conferences, pretentious directors, pushy critics, self-important festival 
officials, aggressive paparazzi, sexual shenanigans, and the constant babble of 
many languages. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the filmmakers (all of whom do double duty as actors) shot a good 
deal of their footage while a recent edition of the Taormina Film Festival was 
in progress. (There are cameos by Cyd Charisse, a gracious festival honoree, 
director Bob Swaim and producer Chris Sievernich). 
</P>
<P>
Amid a thicket of characters and subplots two young waiters, Carlo (Bruschetta) 
and Ettore (Antonio Caldarella), emerge as the film's central figures when 
they're seduced into signing on as festival gofers with promises of glamour and 
excitement. The film opens, not at the beautiful, cliffhanging village of 
Taormina, but on the Portuguese coast, where an arty new screen version of 
Goethe's "Faust" is shooting. A starlet (Jessica Forde) appearing in it leaves 
for Taormina where she has the promise of a job from a fat, sleazy producer 
named Petronius (Peter Berling). 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, "Private Screenings" (Times-rated Mature for complex narrative, 
adult themes) is sufficiently amusing to overcome a poor 16mm print with even 
worse sound. The filmmakers shoot from the hip, pile on the complications and 
keep things moving briskly. For all their satire, they nevertheless love and 
revere the cinema, as an homage to Fassbinder, via some clips from "Veronika 
Voss," suggests.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 3 OF HOLLYWOOD'S BEST SILENTS AT BING THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Restorations, Rarities &amp; Requests" continues at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art's Bing Theater today and Saturday with three glorious Hollywood 
silents. The 1926 "Ben-Hur," which will be shown with its tinted Technicolor 
sequences and with organist Gaylord Carter performing the original score, 
screens today at 1 p.m. and again at 8 p.m. Douglas Fairbanks' swashbuckling 
"The Black Pirate" (1925) will be shown at 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Saturday, and 
Rudolph Valentino's final film, "The Son of the Sheik" (1926), follows "The 
Black Pirate" at 2:20 and 9:20. 
</P>
<P>
After more than 60 years, "Ben-Hur" remains an awesome and moving religious 
spectacle. Years in the making, it is at once intimate and immense, telling of 
the travails of a young Jerusalem nobleman, Ben-Hur (Ramon Novarro), under 
oppressive Roman rule, while in the background the story of Christ (whose face 
is never seen) unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
Adapted from Gen. Lew Wallace's 1880 novel, "Ben-Hur" is no more subtle or 
complex than an old Classics Comics book. Yet, through Fred Niblo's astute 
direction, it attains the visual eloquence of a mime play. Along with a genuine 
aura of spirituality, it boasts a justly famous chariot race, a splendid sea 
battle and stupendous sets and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Black Pirate," which Douglas Fairbanks Sr. wrote for himself, is the 
prototypical pirate picture. It has a villain of the deepest dye, stirring 
battles at sea, a high-born lady in distress (beauteous Billie Dove) and, best 
of all for Fairbanks fans, a hero who performs feats of daring with 
incomparable athletic grace. 
</P>
<P>
As stylish as it is elementary, the film shows off Fairbanks' gift for 
spectacular acrobatics, culminating in a slide down a ship's mainsail -- while 
slicing it with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
Children are as likely to be enchanted with "The Black Pirate," which the 
Museum of Modern Art considers the finest achievement of early two-strip 
Technicolor, as their parents or grandparents were. So simple a tale is it that 
adults may find themselves feasting more on the remarkable settings (by Karl 
Oscar Borg) and costumes (by Dwight Franklin) than on the story line. "The 
Black Pirate" boasts several magnificent vessels, including a galleon of 
baroque splendor. Incredibly rich in detail, the vessel has the look of 
authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
Under Albert Parker's blithe direction, the film moves rapidly. Fairbanks is 
thoroughly engaging, Dove is lovely and Donald Crisp is a delight as a hearty, 
one-armed old salt who turns good guy in a pinch. As for the Technicolor -- 
Harry Sharp was the cameraman -- it's almost sepia and gives the film a rich, 
burnished glow. 
</P>
<P>
Superior artistically to "The Sheik" (1921), which established Valentino as the 
screen's greatest Latin lover, "The Son of the Sheik," which the redoubtable 
Frances Marion adapted from the E. M. Hull novel, is a heady, flamboyant tale 
of desert passion, easily derided and spoofed today but nonetheless full of 
vigor and dash, thanks to George Fitzmaurice's spirited direction. 
</P>
<P>
However, more than the original did, the film unfortunately suggests strongly 
the possibility of a man taking a woman forcibly -- and her loving it. As a 
period piece the picture is fun but looks bad in the light of women's 
liberation. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, we find Valentino beguiled by a pretty dancing girl (Vilma Banky) with 
whom he has oasis trysts, whereas his father, the old sheik (also played by 
Valentino) wants to marry off his son to a cousin of his English wife (Agnes 
Ayres). 
</P>
<P>
In this pop entertainment from a past era, Valentino remains the eternal symbol 
of exotic glamour and romance -- even if Gloria Steinem would be unlikely to 
approve. Information: (213) 857-6010.

SISLEY A SHOPPER'S HAVEN -- IF YOU LIKE CHEESECAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If future archeologists (or present deconstructivists) were to study the menu 
of the new Sisley Italian Kitchen, they would probably deduce that this 
post-modern culture of ours was predominantly Italian, influenced by Louisiana 
and New York and showing trace evidence of Mexican and Thai influences. 
</P>
<P>
Located in the profoundly post-modern Westside Pavilion, Sisley itself would be 
one of many similar sites, such as Noodles in Glendale, La Vecchia in Santa 
Monica and all the California Pizza Kitchens. A discerning mind, however, might 
identify some distinguishing characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's Sisley's location in a shopping mall that makes its designer good 
looks not in the least pretentious. After all, how hip and cool and elite can a 
restaurant be when most of its customers struggle in with armloads of 
Nordstrom's and May Co. bags and wear that dazed, exhausted look that only 
three hours in a mega-mall (or spending $200 on a pair of shoes) can produce? 
In fact, with its warm beige walls and deeply colored paintings of Los Angeles, 
its many gleaming surfaces and cheerful staff, Sisley could be defined as a 
modern-day haven. You can take a load off your feet, be greeted by good-looking 
young people, drink a decent cappuccino, eat goat cheese. 
</P>
<P>
As with most of its sister post-modern Italian Kitchens, Sisley has an 
energetic, young, efficient staff. We arrived one Saturday night without 
reservations. "Doncha worry," the host consoled in pure Hobokenese, "we'll 
getcha down, no problem." 
</P>
<P>
We were gotten down in a tiny wall table, inches from another tiny table, which 
was soon overwhelmingly inhabited by a couple and their motorcycle helmets. As 
it seems to happen more and more these days, we found ourselves once again in a 
restaurant where the music and noise level was so loud, we had to yell to 
converse. Intermittently, we hollered at each other, but mostly, we relaxed, 
looked at the young, casual clientele, and nibbled on some hot but doughy herb 
bread. 
</P>
<P>
The food is reasonably priced and reasonably unremarkable. The bufala 
mozzarella, served on a lettuce leaf, was fresh and good. A blackened calamari 
appetizer was only faintly peppery and its alleged spicy Cajun sauce tasted 
like cocktail sauce with Tobasco. 
</P>
<P>
The broiled half chicken turned out to be four nicely cooked pieces of a small 
chicken in a winey sauce around a huge mound of more steamed broccoli. The 
chicken penne, which also had basil, spinach and tomatoes, was light and 
clean-tasting, whereas the angel hair pasta was glopped up with a heavy tomato 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing flopped miserably, but nothing, or almost nothing, truly sang. By the 
end of dinner, we'd had enough to eat. We weren't sure we even wanted 
after-dinner coffee. Then, as good waiters often do, our waiter sold us 
dessert: cheesecake. But not just any cheesecake, he promised. Cheesecake flown 
in two or three times a week from S&amp;S Cheesecake in NYC. Out of duty, we 
thought we'd try a bite or two. I ate an entire piece, which no doubt doubled 
my day's whole caloric intake. Of my visits there, I enjoyed Sisley the most 
one Sunday afternoon. In broad daylight, the restaurant shed some of its 
designer severity; it looked and felt like a very nicely appointed coffee shop. 
There weren't too many customers, just a few weary people sprawled comfortably 
about. We sat in a bright, roomy window booth. The service, as usual, was 
likable and prompt. The food, as usual, was for the most part satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
Remembering the New York cheesecake, I took a chance on the Brooklyn pizza, a 
juicy, tomatoey pie with peppers and onions, sausage and pepperoni -- pretty 
darn good, too. Four dollars worth of mixed grilled vegetables turned out to be 
one small slice each of onion, tomato, and eggplant, plus a few mushrooms and 
rather more steamed broccoli flowerets. A "mixed greens" salad only contained 
one green -- romaine lettuce -- hearts of palm, radicchio and pine nuts. It was 
certainly better than the Sisley Caesar, a salad so dry its croutons blew about 
in the wake of a passing waiter. 
</P>
<P>
The next time I'm at the Westside Pavilion, loaded down with packages and full 
of buyer's remorse from spending a week's salary on a bathrobe, I know the 
procedure. Window booth at Sisley. Big bottle of Pellegrino. Cheesecake. 
</P>

HALLEY'S NEW UNIVERSE: SPIRITUALITY AND TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neo-Geo was a mid-'80s art trend that never really got off the ground. Also 
known as Smart Art, Neo-Geo referred to a refurbished style of geometric 
abstraction that incorporated elements of Appropriationism, Pop, Minimalism and 
Conceptualism. New York artist Peter Halley -- a whiz kid known as much for his 
writings on art theory as for his work -- was the leading exponent of the 
style; and, as can be seen in an exhibit at the Michael Kohn Gallery in Santa 
Monica, Halley's work is progressing in leaps and bounds, though the trend that 
launched it ran out of steam some time ago. 
</P>
<P>
Halley explains himself as "interested in the two-dimensional, graphic quality 
of contemporary life; flat information -- architectural diagrams, corporate 
flow charts, electronic circuit boards -- have come to dominate our cognitive 
universe." Fed on the ideas of Michel Foucault, Marshall McLuhan and Andy 
Warhol, Josef Albers' color theory, and a healthy dose of semiotics, his work 
concerns itself with what's going on visually and spatially in our culture. 
"One of the basic premises in my work," he says, "is that the flat, 
diagrammatic, two-dimensional space of our culture is more important than the 
three-dimensional objects in it." That's a highly debatable point, but a 
provocative one -- but then, Halley is never less than provocative. 
</P>
<P>
This new body of work marks a major departure for the artist. For several 
years, Halley's ideas took the form of resolutely flat and confrontational 
hard-edge abstractions rendered in eye-searing Day-Glo colors. His new work is 
devoid of color, and the flatness is gone as well. Large sculptural relief 
paintings rendered in drab gray fiberglass, these new pieces are described by 
Halley as "diagramatic projections." He's still dealing with the idea of flow 
charts, but his work is getting thicker and more ambitious; and, among the 
things he attempts to chart with these philosophical constructs is the merging 
of spirituality and technology. According to Halley, technology is an order 
that's come to dominate all other orders, so for him it's taken on 
transcendental powers. 
</P>
<P>
Describing his painting technique as "mechanical and without reflection," 
Halley never violates the structural integrity of the grid that is central to 
his work, and he alludes to the constraint of geometrical order in all the 
pieces. This is particularly true of "Cinder Block Prison," a comically severe 
piece that revolves around a barred square that resembles a prison cell. Halley 
had these works fabricated at a Hollywood prop house called "Scenery West," and 
they're ostentatiously artificial; but at the same time, they're threatening 
and curiously sad and claustrophobic. Looking at them, one thinks of the 
philosopher who theorizes himself into an ideological corner, the scientist who 
burns off a finger at his own laboratory table. Placing its faith in science 
and numbers, the work dismisses the powers of luck and magic -- things that 
don't show up on flow charts and resist quantification. This is one of several 
loaded issues raised by these complex, very hip paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kohn Gallery: 920 Colorado Blvd., Santa Monica, (213) 393-7713, to Jan 
4. Closed Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
American Gothic: A current of Gothic, distinctly American mysticism evocative 
of Albert Pinkham Ryder runs through the work of Joe Andoe. Born and raised in 
Tulsa, Okla., where he grew up in a strictly religious household, Andoe paints 
with the painful earnestness characteristic of devotional pictures and the 
roiling emotions of someone on intimate terms from an early age with the idea 
of heaven and hell. As with paintings by William Wegman, his work exudes a 
weird, blissed-out spookiness. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Andoe's pictures centered on Christian religious motifs; this new 
body of work deals with symbols of nature -- geese, horses, roses, oak 
branches. Andoe renders this vocabulary of simple forms with a crude hand that 
puts one in mind of the folk culture of the Bible Belt (such things as weather 
vanes and quilting patterns), and usually floats them over generic landscapes 
indicated by broad horizontal bands of contrasting color. For instance, a strip 
of brown is the earth, a wider strip of white is the sky, and suspended smack 
dab in middle of the composition is a huge black rose. These vast, empty 
landscapes perhaps allude to the endless plains that surround Andoe's childhood 
home; what the black rose alludes to is anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
A reductive painter who works with a rough touch, Andoe imbues his work with a 
barely controlled hysteria; when he paints light it has a piercing clarity, 
when he paints dark it's a velvety, deathly black you could drown in. 
Accentuating the strange climate of these works is the fact that Andoe signs 
his paintings in a flowery script, and often prominently positions the 
signature at the center of his compositions. Andoe explains this affectation 
with the theory that the paintings are "offerings," and the signature preserves 
the identity of the offerer. That humble idea doesn't quite jibe with the 
effect of the signature, which is strangely aggressive, almost hostile. 
</P>
<P>
BlumHelman: 916 Colorado Blvd., Santa Monica, (213-451-0955), to Jan 5. Closed 
Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Classical Gas: "I am a classicist at heart," says Gunther Forg, a West German 
conceptualist best known for ambitious installations designed to investigate 
architectural theory, among many other things. In a series of new paintings 
executed on lead sheeting over wood, he takes a revisionist look at Abstract 
Expressionism -- and comes up with very handsome paintings whose conceptual 
underpinnings are hard indeed to detect. This looks like straight, "sincere" 
expressionism, but in light of Forg's history there must be more to them, 
right? Well, maybe not. One detects a faint whiff of potentially sarcastic 
nostalgia -- Barnett Newman is invoked, along with Rothko -- but the paintings 
don't seem intended to be ironic (they're too somber and evocative for that). 
Stare at them long and hard, but no trap door reveals itself; they tell nothing 
about themselves, other than that they're beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view are small paintings by Robert Fosdick forged out of glass and 
steel. Cold, Minimalist works dominated by limpid, shimmering surfaces that 
suck up the viewer's reflection like a metaphysical sponge, Fosdick shows us 
nothing we haven't seen before, but his version works just fine.

STAGE BEAT: TWO DUNN ONE-ACTS UP FRONT WITH INNER LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most playwrights like to keep that most precious of narrative devices -- a 
character's back story -- in the wings. For his one-act pair, "The Sterile 
Shadow" and "Coyote Summer," at Theatre/Theater in Hollywood, writer/director 
Harry Dunn brings his back stories out on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"Shadow" is much cruder in this regard than "Coyote," as it shows us a young 
man named Bobby (Tanner Parsons) talking to an offstage shrink about his 
identity crisis. It's imprisoning dramatically, since the piece can't be 
anything more than Bobby revealing a past dominated by a now-dead older brother 
and deep confusion over women. This is only as theatrical as the actor doing 
the monologue, and Parsons lends Bobby a quiet desperation that never once 
indulges in emotional excess. 
</P>
<P>
Some may carp that "Coyote's" depiction of two female strangers meeting in a 
campground -- unkempt, earthy Margie (Melissa Berger) and delicate, prissy 
Rydell (Denise Cochran) -- is more of the same schematic and formulaic stuff 
that passes for comedy these days. 
</P>
<P>
But they would be missing the wonderful intangibles here: how Margie projects 
her disgust for her own jilting boyfriend onto Rydell's (Christopher Turman, 
who lacks a dominating edge) or how Rydell swings back and forth between her 
need for male security and Margie's call for independence. Their back stories 
may be front and center, but Berger and Cochran uncover some sad and touching 
mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sterile Shadow" and "Coyote Summer," Theatre/Theater, 1713 N. Cahuenga 
Blvd., Hollywood, Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends Jan 5. $10; (213) 871-6985. 
Running time: 2 hours.

'Masked Angel' Declines at Cast 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Dale's "Masked Angel," at the Cast Theatre in Hollywood, is a fable that 
seems lost in continental drift. It depicts the effect a young Danish 
Adonis-type who's new to the States (Alexis Arquette) has on an American 
gallery owner (Ian Ross) with a bloated ego and a taste for sadomasochism. 
Ross' cynical assistant (Peter Gregorycq) shares his boss' corruption but not 
his girlfriend's (Shandra Beri) careerism. Meanwhile, Ross' key American patron 
(Marianne Bergonzi) acts like an aesthetic Mafioso and Ross' favorite artist -- 
a Russian (Alexa Hunter) -- feels used. 
</P>
<P>
It's the sick, fetid Americans against the idealist Europeans, which is an odd 
spin on history. This isn't as bothersome as how Dale's play starts out with a 
complex rhythm and wit and gradually declines into obvious metaphors swirling 
around the warping of love into pain and the betrayal of beauty. Similarly, 
director Paul Warner's initially stark imagery gives way to posings and a 
mannered Pieta tableau at the end. 
</P>
<P>
"Masked Angel," Cast Theatre, 804 N. El Centro, Hollywood, Wednedays-Thursday, 
8 p.m. Ends Jan. 15. $10; (213) 462-0265. Running time: 1 hour, 15 minutes.

Sexual Confusion in 'High Strung Quartet' 
</P>
<P>
You feel underdressed sitting down to Leslie Irons' production of Evan 
Bridenstien's "High Strung Quartet (for Unstrung Voices)" at West Coast 
Ensemble in Hollywood. There's John Ballowe's glistening drawing room set, and 
then Irons' handsome quartet of actors elegantly sit down in their best black 
evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
But, like "Tamara," things soon get messy between the characters, all nicknamed 
by David (Stefan Kalinka), who calls himself "Spoon": "Lash" (Chuck Marra), 
Spoon's roomie who swears too much that he's not gay and likes "Sheets" (Yvette 
Heyden), who dislikes Lash but has her eye on "Brush" (Ron Houck), who has his 
eye on Spoon. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds confusing, but unlike "Tamara," "Quartet" isn't messy enough. Lash's and 
Brush's confusion over their sexual identities triggers the four-way roundelay 
with the straight Sheets and gay Spoon as poles, but Irons fails in his 
deliberately static staging to make the confusion truly giddy and dizzying. 
While Houck nicely suggests a fine chap who can't make up his mind and Kalinka 
infuses warmth into a hopelessly goody-good caricature, Heyden isn't bitchy 
enough and Marra is hardly the effeminate-looking guy we're told about in the 
text. 
</P>
<P>
"High Strung Quartet (with Unstrung Voices)," West Coast Ensemble, 6240 
Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends 
Feb. 2. $12; (213) 871-1052. Running time: 1 hour, 50 minutes.

Hunger After One-Acts at West Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
Three courses of one-acts -- or "Trois Entrees," as it's pretentiously called 
at the West Hollywood Playhouse -- do not always make a meal. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Hatcher's "Downtown," for instance, concludes with a gimmick that 
undercuts what had been a slightly biting, cagey depiction of three young 
writers (Alexander Apple, Ray Ivey and Justine Madero) trying to out-do the 
Bret Easton Ellis/Jay McInerney crowd. The cast relishes tossing out Hatcher's 
mean zingers; now, they should ask for a rewrite. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Goodman has neither a gimmick nor an ending for her "Reservations for 
Two," about a calm guy (Cooper Layne) trying to dine with his frazzled date 
(Veronica Blak). Blak loses control over her woman losing control, and all 
Layne can do is leave. 
</P>
<P>
At least there's a little more going on in Bob Krakower's "4 AM (Open All 
Night)," such as whether Riley Wood's married man will quit moaning to the 
diner owner (Richard Fast) and hit up on Molly Lorenz' clearly single woman. 
There's a potential sexual tension that completely escapes the cast and renders 
the scene vaporous. 
</P>
<P>
Deborra-Lee Furness directed. 
</P>
<P>
"Trois Entrees," West Hollywood Playhouse, 666 N. Robertson Blvd., today, 8 and 
10 p.m.; Saturday 8 p.m. Ends Saturday. $8; (213) 962-7056. Running time: 55 
minutes.

'Wide Torsos' Leaves a Gap at igLoo 
</P>
<P>
Any show that promises music by Yello, Mantovani, Throbbing Gristle, J. S. 
Bach, Jon Hassell and Brian Eno and a title like "Of All the Wide Torsos in All 
the Wild Glen" already sounds interesting. 
</P>
<P>
But what our ears get with Paul Peditto's play at igLoo in Hollywood is a 
meaningless assault, like a rattling heater blowing too much hot air. Peditto 
intends to give grotesquely comic heft to the American obsession with fame and 
physical make-over: Thus, his obese famous playwright Maxwell (David Robinson, 
in a numbingly nattering performance) is in a plastic surgeon's waiting room 
before he goes under the knife. For no particular reason the doctor's assistant 
(Maria Tirabassi) takes an interest in the plump scribe. 
</P>
<P>
The rest is a tiresome duet, filled with musings about Esquire magazine's 
values and the parallels between eating and sexual disorders. Chris Peditto 
didn't so much direct as steer traffic, which really becomes a nonsensical jam 
when a delivery man from a hamburger joint brings in a pizza. Let's add theater 
disorders to the list. 
</P>
<P>
"Of All the Wide Torsos in All the Wild Glen," igLoo, 6543 Santa Monica Blvd., 
Hollywood, Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends Feb. 4. $7; (213) 962-3771. Running 
time: 1 hour, 5 minutes.

TRASH POETRY IN ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lypsinka is one of a kind, a characterization that must have crept into the 
mind of her creator, John Epperson, during one too many glazed-out trips to 
record store cut-out bins. 
</P>
<P>
Epperson's performance as Lypsinka at the Cafe Largo in Hollywood -- a triumph 
in the still mercifully obscure art of combining drag characterization with 
lip-syncing -- was bizarre, weird and surprisingly entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
He/she cruised onto the restaurant's tiny stage dressed in an outfit that would 
surely have gotten him a role as a cheap nightclub performer in a '40s 
detective movie. With his make-up slashed across eyes and lips in bright, 
primary colors, his gestures grand and diva-like, his movements constantly 
implying nasty sub-texts, Lypsinka was the very image of trash poetry in 
action. 
</P>
<P>
But then something very interesting happened. Lypsinka's lip-syncing was 
perfect -- never so much as a flawed lip flap -- and within a few minutes the 
performance was transformed from an eccentric gimmick into a fascinating 
theatrical collage. 
</P>
<P>
Like Andy Warhol, like contemporary rap mix artists, Lypsinka assembles the 
detritus of pop art -- in his case, obscure songs from performers like Gisele 
Mackenzie, Dolores Gray, Judy Canova and Kay Stevens -- into completely new 
mosaics. His work both derives from, and comments upon, the vast, rusting pile 
of entertainment trivia that is the heritage of the last five decades. 
</P>
<P>
And it is effective, both as commentary and as sheer humor. Two "phone scenes," 
in which Lypsinka answered one illusionary phone call after another, only to 
"hear," via his lip-sync, bits and pieces of dialogue ranging from Joan 
Crawford and Bette Davis to Patty Duke and Caterina Valente, fascinated 
precisely because so many of the lines were familiar, highly atmospheric trivia 
icons. 
</P>
<P>
"Lypsinka," Cafe Largo, 432 N. Fairfax Ave., Hollywood, Thursdays-Fridays, 9 
p.m. Ends Dec. 28. Special performance Dec. 27, 10:30 p.m. for Act-Up LA. $6; 
(213) 852-1851. Running time: 90 minutes.

SIGN OF VICTORY: But if you do stay away, you might -- repeat, might -- miss a 
brand-new tradition at the stadium. . . . The Big A -- the original halo-topped 
scoreboard moved to the parking lot after stadium expansion -- finally is 
working again. Henceforth whenever the Rams win, a light will slowly crawl up 
one leg of the scoreboard and down the other in all-night celebration. It could 
happen Monday; the Rams beat the 49ers three weeks ago up north. . . . P.S.: If 
the Angels win, the halo will blink overnight. Dallas M. Jackson and Lily Eng

SEA WHAT? Yet another weird sea creature has made a rare appearance along the 
county's coast -- this time a pair of sea mice. Found dead by county Marine 
Institute researchers, the "mice" are actually gray, furry, 4-inch-long worms 
that have flippers for swimming and burrowing. . . . They'll be displayed at 
the institute starting Monday. Dallas M. Jackson and Lily Eng

GRIDIRON-LOCK: Monday is going to be a nightmare for those commuters who use 
the Santa Ana, Garden Grove and Orange freeways. The Rams-49ers game will be 
drawing its sellout crowd to Anaheim Stadium right at the going-home commute 
hours. . . . "Kickoff is at 6, and fans don't have time to go home first so 
they drive one-to-a-car, and it's the '49ers game. You couldn't ask for a worse 
combination for traffic," said a city spokeswoman. . . . Her advice: If you're 
not going to the game, stay far away. Dallas M. Jackson and Lily Eng

. More than a quarter have children, and 18% have more than one. 
</P>
<P>
Half the children are 5 years or younger. Eleven percent are working; 67% are 
looking for work. . . . Almost half have been homeless for more than a year, 
almost a quarter for more than three years. Four in 10 have been county 
residents for more than 10 years.

SUPERVISORS TO PROPOSE SUIT IF CANYON JAIL SITE TALKS FAIL; 
</P>
<P>
PRISONER CROWDING: A MAJORITY OF BOARD SAYS IT IS PREPARED TO TAKE ACTION TO 
FOIL DEVELOPMENT OR ANNEXATION OF IRVINE CO. LAND. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A majority of Orange County supervisors will propose next week that the county 
consider legal action to acquire the controversial Gypsum Canyon jail site if 
negotiations with the Irvine Co. do not produce a breakthrough within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter circulated to their colleagues Thursday, Supervisors Harriett M. 
Wieder and Thomas F. Riley urged negotiations with the company, which owns 
2,500 acres in the canyon near Anaheim. Company executives have said they are 
willing to talk but stress that the land is not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the possibility of a standoff, a majority of the board now is going 
even further, and several members confirmed Thursday that they are ready to 
take tougher action if negotiations fail. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying it's time to get busy with the Irvine Co.," Riley said. "And if 
that doesn't work, let's do whatever we have to do to build this jail." 
</P>
<P>
The letter and its recommendations come as board members brace for a landmark 
meeting Tuesday, when the supervisors will take up other matters relating to 
the county's mounting crisis in jail overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's five jails were designed to hold 3,203 inmates, but instead 
they regularly house about 4,400. Meanwhile, thousands of prisoners are being 
released every year to make room for more serious offenders inside the jails. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of the recent overcrowding have attracted the attention of a federal 
judge, who in October ordered a special monitor to inspect the jails. The 
monitor completed his work earlier this month, and strongly urged the 
supervisors to press ahead with the controversial Gypsum Canyon jail. 
</P>
<P>
That site was selected by the board in 1987, but it takes four supervisors to 
authorize acquiring the land through condemnation, and only three support 
Gypsum Canyon. That and financial considerations have stymied the board's 
efforts to proceed with the project. 
</P>
<P>
At their Tuesday session, the supervisors will be asked to reaffirm their 
support for Gypsum Canyon and to prepare financial plans regarding the project. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wieder and Riley -- joined by Supervisor Roger R. Stanton -- 
recommend authorizing immediate negotiations with the Irvine Co. If the talks 
do not show signs of progress after two months, the county attorney's office 
then would be authorized to "prepare and present to this board appropriate 
legal actions as necessary to preserve the county's option to acquire the 
property and prevent incompatible land-use development of this site." 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not sign the letter distributed Thursday, Stanton said later 
that it "has my full support." 
</P>
<P>
Instructing the county attorney to prepare for a deadlock in negotiations could 
set up any number of possibilities, officials said. It could give board members 
the legal authority they need to begin condemnation proceedings to acquire the 
land, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
But it could also lay the groundwork for a lawsuit against the city of Anaheim, 
which is seeking to annex the land, thereby taking it out of the county's 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
"Gypsum Canyon may be subject to potential annexation to the city of Anaheim 
for purposes of residential and commercial development," Wieder and Riley said 
in their letter. "Without question, the county must be prepared to take action 
to preserve the county's options for building a jail in Gypsum Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
Riley declined to speculate on a possible county lawsuit against Anaheim, but 
Stanton said it would be considered along with other options. 
</P>
<P>
As pressure mounts for the board to take action, however, the major financial 
questions remain. Even if it scaled back to a smaller jail than originally 
proposed, building in Gypsum Canyon could cost nearly $500 million, and the 
county says that it is broke. 
</P>
<P>
Just this week, the supervisors heard a report from budget officials warning 
that the county faces a $13-million, mid-year deficit and projecting a much 
larger shortfall later on. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Brad Gates, in an interview Thursday, acknowledged that new jail 
construction will be expensive, and he called for a special election in March, 
1991, to consider a half-cent sales tax to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we don't have the money now," Gates said. "So let's put the issue on 
the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
Gates has long supported a sales-tax vote on the issue, but surveys offer 
little hope that such a measure would win at this time. One poll last year 
found that just 37% of county voters would back a half-cent sales tax for 
jails, while 50% opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
Even Stanton, an ardent supporter of Gypsum Canyon, expressed doubts about 
holding a vote so soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to put something on the ballot and put something on without delay," 
Stanton said, "but I've never heard any discussion about going in March."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;

<P>
PLANNERS OPPOSE REZONING FOR POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID F. BURKE

<TEXT>
<P>
Plans for up to 32 homes for indigent families received a setback this week 
when the city Planning Commission voted against a zoning change. 
</P>
<P>
The site is 1 1/2 acres at the south end of property owned by Our Lady of 
Guadalupe Roman Catholic Church on La Habra Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was to rezone it from R1, allowing up to eight units per acre, to 
R2, allowing up to 14 units. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 people packed the City Council chambers to hear zoning arguments. 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Director Kathy Kim said 67 postcards had been received favoring 
the project. Real estate agent Lynne Rolnik presented a petition that she said 
contained 300 signatures opposing the project. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Paul Thornburg ruled that neither the postcards nor the 
petition was appropriate because the commission was considering only zoning 
changes and not possible developments. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Baker, who lives near the site, told the commission that in her work as a 
law enforcement officer she has contact with homeless people. "I know what kind 
of area this could become," she said. "If you change the zoning, you're going 
to have a lot of different kinds of people coming into that neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburg responded that the zoning could result in low-income housing or 
"high-priced condos." 
</P>
<P>
Rolnik said her major concern is home values. She told the commission that a 
sale she had hoped to finalize fell through because of the proposed zoning 
change. "Neighbors are concerned about property that they've owned for years," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The next step will be a discussion of the proposal by the City Council. DAVID

2 POLICIES ON COLLEGE BOOKS ARE RESCINDED 
</P>

<P>
A requirement that books purchased for Saddleback Community College District 
libraries "contribute to maintaining high moral standards" was eliminated this 
week after teachers complained that it was too vague. 
</P>
<P>
The board of trustees agreed on a 5-3 vote to rescind the 21-year-old policy, 
along with a requirement that books "stimulate intellectual curiosity." 
</P>
<P>
The majority agreed with teachers who argued that it was too difficult to 
decide what constitutes high moral standards and what does not. 
</P>
<P>
"The librarians should be choosing material that is academically sound and not 
be deciding whose morals to uphold," said Trustee Shirley Gellatly, who voted 
to rescind the policy. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been people elsewhere who have tried to ban 'The Wizard of Oz' -- a 
book that my family enjoys -- because they think there is no such thing as a 
good witch," student Trustee Kymberly Pine said. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Iris Swanson said, "I see no conflict between saying that we are going 
to maintain high moral standards and academic freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, along with Trustees John C. Connolly and Joan J. Hueter, voted against 
rescinding the requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody in the community challenges what we teach or have in our library, 
it would befall the members of the board to address the issue," Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Valley College librarian Fred Forbes said the policy change will have no 
effect on his purchasing decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"The books and the materials that are purchased are related to our courses and 
their content and not bought just to get them," Forbes said. "That's the first 
level. Secondly, we buy reference books and other materials that are related to 
lifetime learning." 
</P>
<P>
Forbes said the library does not subscribe to "Playboy" or other magazines of 
that genre, which can sometimes be found in college libraries. "But if we did," 
he said, "it would be because a teacher requested it in order to illustrate 
something in advertising -- or maybe a women's studies professor who wanted to 
have a discussion about such magazines. It wouldn't be for the students' 
titillation." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Marcia Milchiker and Trustees Robert L. Moore and Harriet S. 
Walther also voted to rescind the policy. TERRY SPENCER

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marcia Milchiker has been elected president of the Saddleback Community College 
District Board of Trustees, replacing Joan J. Hueter. 
</P>
<P>
Milchiker, a Laguna Hills research biologist, was elected this week during a 
secret ballot at the board's annual organizational meeting.

It is the first time that Milchiker, who has been a trustee since 1985, has 
been president of the eight-member board. The president conducts the board's 
meetings, appoints committees and represents the board at various on- and 
off-campus functions. 
</P>
<P>
Milchiker said a focus of her term will be the search for a third campus site 
in the district, in addition to Saddleback and Irvine Valley colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Robert L. Moore was elected vice president, and Hueter was elected 
clerk.

RESTAURANTS' ORDER: CLEANLINESS COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite protests from the Chamber of Commerce and the California Restaurant 
Assn., the City Council this week unanimously approved an ordinance creating 
the first program in the county requiring a course on cleanliness and food 
handling for restaurant managers. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance makes mandatory a four-hour course to educate managers of 
restaurants with five or more employees. 
</P>
<P>
The course will be administered by the environmental health department of the 
county's Health Care Agency and will affect more than 200 restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Each location will have eight months to comply with the ordinance. Restaurants 
must have at least one manager who has earned a certificate by attending the 
$20 course and passing a written exam. The certificate is valid for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the new ordinance complained that the city program duplicates 
similar efforts by private industry and does not include smaller restaurants, 
markets and other food facilities prone to sanitation violations. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Dart, a member of the Board of Supervisors Food Sanitation Advisory Council, 
said a task force concluded that the estimated course cost is too low and 
predicted a fee increase of up to $125. Dart said the program could also cost 
employers up to $150 per employee for time and travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Utter, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce's governmental affairs 
committee, called the course "an unnecessary expense to put on the backs of 
restaurant owners" during an economic slowdown. MARY HELEN BERG

BOHMAN WILL HEAD UNION HIGH BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Huntington Beach Union High School District board has unanimously elected 
trustee Charmayne Bohman as its new president. 
</P>
<P>
Bohman, the board's vice president for the past year, succeeds Linda 
Moulton-Patterson, who left the board after being elected last month to the 
Huntington Beach City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Bohman, 53, a psychologist and a professor at Cal State Dominguez Hills, was 
elected to the board in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Although the district in recent years has been strapped with budget constraints 
and other problems, its trustees typically have quelled any potential turmoil 
by working collectively to address those issues, a strategy that Bohman said 
will continue in her term. 
</P>
<P>
"Linda and I have been very close while we've been on the board, and we have a 
lot of similarities in terms of our direction for the district and (in) 
personality," Bohman said Thursday. She added that curriculum reform and 
continued anti-gang efforts will be among the board's main concerns in the 
coming year. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Bonnie Castrey, the board's clerk the past year, was promoted Tuesday 
to vice president, and member Jerry Sullivan was elected the new clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees are tentatively scheduled to choose a new member to fill 
Moulton-Patterson's seat at their Jan. 29 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Applications for the post will be accepted at the district office at least 
through the end of the year, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Any registered voter living within the district boundaries, which includes 
Huntington Beach and parts of Fountain Valley and Westminster, may apply for 
the board position. JOHN PENNER

2 TRUSTEES DENOUNCE CHANCELLOR'S RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rancho Santiago Community College District Board of Trustees voted in favor 
of a $5,500 pay raise to Chancellor Robert D. Jensen this week, but two board 
members denounced the decision as too costly. 
</P>
<P>
The raise brings Jensen's annual salary to $102,980. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees Charles (Pete) Maddox and Brian E. Conley said they objected to the 
increased salary because of financial burdens on the district. They added that 
their opposition was not based on Jensen's job performance. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a lot of question about his effectiveness as chancellor," Maddox 
said. "It's merely a question of economics. We are headed towards some really 
tough economic times, and we are all going to have to bite the bullet." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Shirley Ralston defended the pay raise, which she said is 
consistent with the cost-of-living adjustment given to all faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone else got the same cost-of-living adjustment, so why shouldn't the 
chancellor be included?" Ralston said. "He is one of the best chancellors in 
the state, and when you don't give him a simple cost-of-living raise, that 
sends a message." 
</P>
<P>
Jensen, who has been chancellor of the district since 1984, has a four-year 
contract that expires in 1994.

CONFERENCE: THOUSANDS GATHER IN ANAHEIM TO EXCHANGE THEORIES ON MENTAL ILLNESS. 
TOPICS RANGE FROM VIOLENCE TO THUMB-SUCKING. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 6,000 counselors and psychologists gathered Thursday at the Anaheim 
Convention Center to hear some of the world's leaders in psychotherapy discuss 
their disparate views of treating mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
Among the luminaries here through Sunday: philosopher and psychologist Rollo 
May, existential psychiatrist Viktor Frankl who long ago knew the father of 
psychotherapy, Sigmund Freud; sexual disorders therapist Helen Singer Kaplan; 
and activist Betty Friedan. 
</P>
<P>
Though not a psychologist, Friedan, founder of the National Organization for 
Women, was expected to offer a feminist perspective on psychotherapy in a 
keynote address scheduled for tonight, conference organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Evolution of Psychotherapy," this is the second international 
conference of its kind. The first was held five years ago in Phoenix to 
celebrate what would have been Freud's 100th birthday and drew 7,000 mental 
health professionals from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's conferees called this second large meeting of mental health 
professionals extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most comprehensive meeting of psychotherapists in our culture," 
said May, 81, who traveled from San Francisco to debate theory with colleagues, 
see old friends and grumble a little about younger therapists who sounded "too 
dogmatic." 
</P>
<P>
South African psychologist Arnold Lazarus agreed. "It's extremely rare to get 
so many luminaries under one roof and so many people with divergent views. 
</P>
<P>
Lazarus, who advocates "multimodal" therapy, drawing from several 
psychotherapeutic schools, noted that in the 1985 conference, "I came away 
humbled" by the great psychologists he met -- including ones he did not agree 
with. 
</P>
<P>
"Also," he said, "last time there were many more fireworks with people 
exchanging uncomplimentary statements," but "this time, it's far more 
scholarly" and more polite. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, Lazarus said, many of the ideas expressed here this week will 
probably be discredited several years from now. 
</P>
<P>
In psychotherapy, "We are today where phrenology was 150 years ago," Lazarus 
said, referring to the long-ago discredited "science" of determining a person's 
character by analyzing the bumps and shape of his skull. 
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference, which began Wednesday, is offering lectures on 
psychotherapeutic theory plus workshops on depression, anxiety, family 
violence, sexual dysfunction and recovery from childhood trauma, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Frankl described the coping skills he used that enabled him to survive 
imprisonment in the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. At one 
point, walking through snow-covered fields in shoes that had holes in them, "I 
was in despair," Frankl said, but he pulled himself out by imagining "that I 
was standing behind a lectern," describing the psychology of a concentration 
camp. He later wrote an article describing that psychology. 
</P>
<P>
In between Thursday's lectures and panel discussions, participants could grab a 
cup of coffee and wander through a large hall where exhibitors marketed 
self-help books, summer camps for drug-abusing teens and therapy "toys" for 
adults and children alike. 
</P>
<P>
One booth was selling a "pregnancy doll" that you could stick pins in when you 
felt nauseated. Another was doing brisk sales in audiotapes -- $9.95 a piece -- 
to correct thumb-sucking and low self-esteem, as well as a family therapy board 
game that covers such issues as divorce, separation and death and is played 
with "coping" and "stress" cards. 
</P>
<P>
Conference chairman Jeffrey Zweig, director of the Milton H. Erickson 
Foundation in Phoenix, said the idea of the meeting was to bring together 
leaders from some of the 300 distinct schools of psychotherapy around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its educational purpose, the conference is also fun, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the luminaries (Albert Ellis, originator of rational emotive theory) 
just came up to me and said, 'Let's go to Disneyland tonight,' " Lazarus said. 
</P>
<P>
They'll stay off Space Mountain and the Matterhorn, Lazarus said, but otherwise 
it's no holds barred. 
</P>
<P>
Lazarus suggested major scientific publications should come to Disneyland with 
them -- to take pictures of the famous psycho-therapists in their Mickey Mouse 
ears.

CRESCENT BAY DWELLERS PRAY STORMS WILL SPARE THEM

LAGUNA BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the memories of severe winter storms of the 1980s firmly etched in their 
minds, homeowners along Laguna Beach's scenic Crescent Bay are praying that the 
next few months will spare them the storm-induced devastation of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Because if a new wave of storms does bash the south Orange County coastline, 
homeowners Jim Lund, Ann McDonald, Jim McNaughton and others who live along the 
picturesque cove fear that they could suffer major property damage. And they 
are frustrated that the city won't let them take action to protect their 
multimillion-dollar homes. 
</P>
<P>
While talk continues on a permanent shore-protection device, the City Council 
has rejected plans by the homeowners for an interim solution: the placement of 
1 1/2 tons of sandbags at the base of the bluff through the winter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are just going to give up and keep our fingers crossed and pray," 
McNaughton said after a recent council vote. 
</P>
<P>
Perched on top of cliffs 30 feet to 90 feet above the beach, the multilevel 
homes serve as the backdrop for the beach that is a favorite spot of locals and 
tourists alike. 
</P>
<P>
But like other environmental causes in Laguna Beach that whip up the emotions 
of its citizens, even a temporary shore-protection device has been opposed by 
environmentalists who fear it will hurt the shoreline's natural beauty. 
</P>
<P>
And some citizens have raised doubts that an "El Nino" -- a Pacific Ocean 
weather pattern that causes severe drought in some areas of the Pacific Rim and 
devastating storms in others -- will actually occur. The need for an emergency 
measure, they said, simply does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
"If you base it on historical records," Javier Weckmann, an engineer hired by 
the homeowners, argued recently, "the frequency of storms that cause problems 
in California occur every three years." 
</P>
<P>
Weckmann said record high tides are expected Dec. 31 and "El Nino" systems can 
be expected every three to seven years. The last one, he said, occurred in 
1983. Another series of storms pounded the coastline in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get any kind of significant storms, it's catastrophic," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But while there is opposition to the construction of a seawall or other device, 
there is little argument from opponents that the bluffs have eroded. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are lucky, we will not get hit (by a major storm). But if we do, we will 
have another Lagunita," McDonald said, referring to the January, 1988, storm 
that undermined the foundations of some homes in a section of South Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
One house lost a porch, another lost a bathroom, and several were condemned as 
a result of that storm, Weckmann said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Following that disaster, six Crescent Bay residents whose homes face south and 
are more vulnerable to a South Pacific storm system banded together to hire 
Weckmann and seek city approval for a permanent shore-protection device. 
</P>
<P>
A report submitted by the consultant to the council in August stated that 
Crescent Bay had two slope failures as the result of storms in 1982 and 1983 
and that up to 55 feet of sea cliffs have been lost to storm wave erosion since 
1931. 
</P>
<P>
And after numerous discussions with the Design Review Board and council, the 
residents received an acknowledgment of the problem from city staffers and 
other officials. 
</P>
<P>
But citizens and council members worried that a 380-foot seawall in four 
segments would not help and instead cause further erosion in the cove. 
</P>
<P>
Because not all the homeowners in the bay support the installation of a seawall 
-- some homeowners have very old seawalls that provide adequate protection -- 
there is fear that the force of the waves might divert the water around the 
edges of the wall and undermine those areas left unprotected by the new 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
Former mayor Jon Brand, a member of the environmental group Village Laguna, 
said there is also the concern about aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
"Seawalls on pristine beaches are bad," he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
The council in August ordered that a lengthy environmental impact report be 
conducted before deciding whether to allow the construction of a permanent 
shore-protection device. 
</P>
<P>
But with the threat of winter storms still facing them, the residents retreated 
and came back with proposed temporary solutions, the last being the placement 
of sandbags through the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
"Staff still believes that some reasonable precautionary level of protection is 
warranted," Community Development Director Kyle Butterwick and City Manager 
Kenneth C. Frank stated in a memo to the council recommending approval. 
</P>
<P>
As council members ran their fingers last week through a sample bag of sand 
collected from underneath a runway at Los Angeles International Airport, 
Weckmann explained that it would match the color and texture of the sand 
already on the beach. Once the storm season had passed, the bags would be torn 
open and the sand would be left on the shore. 
</P>
<P>
Although the residents have agreed to the environmental impact report, Weckmann 
protested to the council that the city has never required an environmental 
impact report for seawalls, including one now being built at Heisler Park. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Robert F. Gentry responded that unlike Crescent Bay, the Heisler 
Park project will not cut into the available beach space because the base of 
the bluff is made up of rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Butterwick also said later that the study was needed because of the magnitude 
of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry and Councilwomen Ann Christoph and Lida Lenney made up the council 
majority that rejected the temporary solution. The consensus was that without 
the environmental report, there was not enough information to determine what 
the effect on the shore would be. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that the council has never certified that there's a need for an 
ocean-protection device," Christoph said, "and the EIR is supposed to be 
documenting what those needs are. We would be prejudging the EIR, in a sense." 
</P>
<P>
She recommended instead that an emergency preparedness plan be developed. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Martha Collison, who voted in support of the residents, said 
that when such an emergency occurs, it will be too late to protect the bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
And so the residents have given up, for now. 
</P>
<P>
With the six homeowners having spent about $150,000 on consultant fees during 
the last three years, McNaughton said their only hope now is that the city lets 
them know before the next winter season whether they can build a permanent 
structure to protect the shore and their homes.

MAN ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL IN SLAYING; 
</P>
<P>
HEARING: DESPITE BEING IDENTIFIED BY AN EYEWITNESS, THE SUSPECT PLEADS NOT 
GUILTY IN THE DEATH OF A NEWPORT BEACH WOMAN WHO OWNED A LODGE IN TULARE 
COUNTY.

<P>
A man who denied killing the Newport Beach woman who owned Camp Nelson Lodge in 
Tulare County was ordered Thursday to stand trial on a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Edward Beauchamp of Fontana declared his innocence, even though he 
admitted being in the mountain community the night Bonnie Jean Hood died and 
even though a witness identified him as the killer. 
</P>
<P>
That witness, Rudy Manuel, 35, was wounded by an assailant who broke into 
Hood's cabin the night of Aug. 19. Manuel said that Hood, 46, went to his cabin 
and asked him to check because she thought something was wrong. Manuel, who was 
the lodge's caretaker, said he then went to Hood's cabin, and Beauchamp burst 
in and ordered him to kneel on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel said he refused "because I knew he was going to put the gun to the back 
of my head and kill me." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Manuel lunged at the gun and was shot in the head. He said he 
pretended to be unconscious and heard two more shots, one of which killed Hood. 
</P>
<P>
Beauchamp, his ankles shackled, testified that he initially went to Camp Nelson 
on a weekend in August after Hood's husband, Jim Hood, told him about the 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant once worked for a real estate development company partly owned by 
Jim Hood, Valley Business Center in Newport Beach. During the preliminary 
hearing, Beauchamp said he recently had been collecting unemployment but also 
made $400 under the table from Jim Hood and his partner. 
</P>
<P>
Beauchamp, 30, said he returned to the mountain community the evening of Aug. 
18 in a futile search for a woman he had met on the previous visit. After 
drinking, dancing and ingesting methamphetamines, he claimed that he left Camp 
Nelson at 1:30 a.m. Aug. 19 to return to the Fontana area about 250 miles 
south. Beauchamp said he arrived at a female friend's home in Southern 
California at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Hood was slain about 3 a.m. that morning. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. MacCrae O'Heaghra said other testimony impeached Beauchamp's 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
However, defense attorney Charles Rothbaum challenged the credibility of 
Manuel's eyewitness identification because of Manuel's head injury. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence in this case stinks, your honor," Rothbaum told Visalia Municipal 
Judge Joseph Kalashian. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge said Manuel's testimony and Beauchamp's admission that he was in 
Camp Nelson the night of the murder are sufficient evidence to order the 
defendant to stand trial. Kalashian scheduled a Dec. 28 arraignment in Tulare 
County Superior Court.

PEARL HARBOR ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm writing because of the oversight or because of the lack of interest by the 
Los Angeles Times in not publishing anything significant about the memorial of 
the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Now more then any time in recent years, we face troubled times where many 
American lives may be lost. 
</P>
<P>
An attack on innocent people is an attack on freedom. 
</P>
<P>
I believe this was a real chance to show all Americans that we honor those who 
gave their lives for freedom, a chance to say we have strong feelings for those 
on the sands of Saudia Arabia as well as we have for those who died in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
It is the duty of all newspapers to help us reflect as well as inform. The past 
is what we build our future on. Our lives are enriched by all news.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
LET'S SAVE THE BAY, BUT DO IT RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much remains to be done to protect Newport Bay from pollution. In a recent 
report, the state's Regional Water Quality Control Board noted that despite a 
73% decrease in wastes flowing into the bay this year, more than half a ton a 
day of nitrate-nitrogen, which produces a thick, green slime of algae, still 
finds its way into the water. 
</P>
<P>
These algae blooms suffocate life in the fragile marine environment, cutting 
off oxygen to fish and small marine animals. The wastes wash into the bay from 
San Diego Creek, which makes its way through business and agricultural areas of 
Irvine and collects runoff from the coastal communities in the area. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of cleanup efforts to date, algae blooms have been diminished, 
mostly by limiting the discharge of nurseries and by getting them to install 
recycling or irrigation monitoring equipment. Experts aren't sure exactly where 
the mysterious half ton is coming from, but the suspects include sewage dumped 
by boats and a wide variety of wastes running into the creek -- pollutants from 
fertilizer used on lawns and greenbelts, or industrial toxic metals. 
</P>
<P>
Not a moment too soon the federal Environmental Protection Agency this year 
required local U.S. officials to begin addressing urban runoff in waterways. 
Pollution that threatens bays and estuaries comes from many places and often is 
directly traceable to everyday activities in the home and workplace. That means 
all a bay's neighbors, not just the nurseries, share responsibility in 
self-policing. 
</P>
<P>
The recent designation of Upper Newport Bay as an ecological reserve was a 
remarkable achievement -- the result of a long battle to protect an 
environmentally sensitive area from indiscriminate development. But the threat 
of pollution from runoff is more insidious than overdevelopment because it is 
not such an easy and visible target. 
</P>
<P>
The battle must be waged by all surrounding communities. Failure to do so puts 
the bay at risk and invites more stringent controls.

Walter Bowman was chosen as mayor this week, beating out fellow council member 
Gail H. Kerry for the position. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, a real-estate agent, was nominated by former Mayor Cecilia L. Age. 
</P>
<P>
Casting votes in his favor were Age and newly elected Councilman Richard 
Partin. Bowman received three votes, including his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan on representing all of the interests in the community," said Bowman, 
who narrowly regained his council seat in November. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry, who was nominated for the position by newcomer Joyce C. Nicholson, was 
backed by members of Concerned Citizens of Cypress. Nicholson is the president 
of the citizens' group. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry was elected to the council in 1985 and was instrumental in defeating a 
proposal to build a large industrial park in one of the last open spaces in the 
city.

One of the attorneys representing nose tackle Joe Phillips said Thursday that 
the Chargers have misrepresented his client's salary demands. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been a little aggravated by the Chargers' characterization of the 
situation," attorney David Morway said. "Joe Phillips is not asking for 100 
percent of his salary. 
</P>
<P>
"The day he went into Bobby Beathard's office he said he came to play and 
wanted to be paid from that day forward and be covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"He went home and found a message on his machine that advised him he would be 
paid half of his salary. They said they wanted to see him on the practice field 
first. They wanted him to come out for nothing, and they decided to activate 
him he would have to sign a new contract and agree to a broad (liability) 
waiver. That was just too much." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips has stayed away from San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium since last week, 
but he will appear at a press conference Tuesday to discuss his situation. The 
Chargers have said they will leave Phillips on the reserve/non-football injury 
list for the remainder of the season, and, although not obligated to do so, 
will pay him half of his salary. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that he wants 100 percent of his pay and that he's spoiled and 
selfish is so inaccurate," Morway said. "The reason he's holding off the press 
conference until next week is so that he doesn't become a distraction to the 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who started the team's first three games, was beaten badly outside a 
Mission Beach restaurant on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning said he was a little concerned with nagging injuries to wide 
receiver Anthony Miller, but Miller practiced and said he was ready for the 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said Miller has been bothered by a sore leg and buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Nate Lewis caught passes with a cast on his hand, and Henning 
said later that Lewis would be "upgraded from doubtful to semi-doubtful." T.J.

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE PREVIEW;

GALLOWAY THE BEST PLAYER, BUT BEST TEAM A TOSSUP

<P>
With the returns in from all precincts, it appears the voters are divided on 
which team will win the Garden Grove League boys' basketball title this season. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove finished 11-12 (8-6 in league) last season, but it returns two 
all-league players in guard Mark Perry and center Bob Ioja. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Garden Grove. On paper they should be the favorites," La Quinta Coach 
Jim Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Eric Hamamoto, whose Rancho Alamitos team is the defending co-champion 
with Kennedy and one of the standout squads again this year, shares Perry's 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"Garden Grove has to be easily considered the favorites," Hamamoto said. "When 
you return four starters and two who were all-league, I don't see how you can't 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Well, sometimes you can't when a team like Kennedy has a 6-foot-9 all-league 
center named Jermaine Galloway. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give it to Kennedy," Pacifica Coach Rhett Heckel said. "They've 
got the most dominating player in the league in Galloway." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton Olivier, the first-year coach at Los Amigos, agreed: "I think Kennedy 
is the team to beat because of Galloway." 
</P>
<P>
And what do Garden Grove Coach Dewey Van Cleave and Kennedy Coach John Mayberry 
think? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to make any predictions we'll win league," Van Cleave said. "But 
I'll say we'll definitely qualify for CIF (Southern Section playoffs)." 
</P>
<P>
Mayberry puts his team third in league behind Garden Grove and Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a team-by-team look: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BOLSA GRANDE 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Tom Cardoza (third year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 8-15, 6-8 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Three. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Sy Sayareth (G, 5-7, Sr.); Din Le (G, 5-6, Sr.); Jim Fletcher 
(F, 6-2, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Robert Fierro (F, 6-4, So.); Vince Mitchell (F, 6-0, Jr.); 
Marcus Wilson (C, 6-1, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Sayareth, who was the sixth man last season, is off to a great start 
with 85 points in four nonleague games. He'll have to keep pumping them in for 
Bolsa Grande to be competitive in league. But getting the ball off the boards 
and into Sayareth's hands will be difficult. "Our biggest concern is our 
rebounding. We don't have the size," Cardoza said. Fierro is the hope for the 
future, but Cardoza said the lanky sophomore needs to beef up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Dewey Van Cleave (sixth year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 11-12, 8-6 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Five. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Joe Aguirre (G, 5-10, Sr.); Bob Ioja (C, 6-3, Sr.); Mark Perry 
(G, 6-3, Sr.); Tim Vasser (F, 6-2, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Cornell Archer (F, 6-0, So.); Scott Flores (G, 5-10, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Van Cleave is counting on Perry and Ioja to turn the Argonauts into 
the championship club others have predicted they could be. Perry is off to a 
good start this season with 56 points in three tournament games. Archer, 
promoted from the freshman team, will start at forward, and Van Cleave said 
Aguirre has the makings of an all-league player. What can opposing teams expect 
from the Argonauts? "We'll be a running team," Van Cleave said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KENNEDY 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John Mayberry (14th year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 18-7, 13-1 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Five. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Jermaine Galloway (C, 6-9, Jr.); Rod Rosales (G, 5-10, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Vince Church (G, 5-9, Sr.); Brian Cline (F, 6-0, Sr.); Morgan 
Murakami (G, 5-10, Jr.); Robert Weber (C, 6-4, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Gone from the Fighting Irish lineup is forward Jim Barker, who last 
season carried he team with 22.6 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. Galloway is 
Kennedy's best hope to replenish the lost production. Rosales had knee surgery 
recently and probably won't be available until the second half of the season, 
if at all. "I need to find a replacement for him," said Mayberry, who reached 
200 victories at Kennedy last year and who has taken the team to the Southern 
section playoffs in 11 of his 13 seasons there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LA QUINTA 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jim Perry (10th year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 2-21, 2-12 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Five. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Three. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Lloyd Bennett (G, 5-8, Jr.); Dusty DePree (F, 6-2, Sr.); Jon 
Ralston (F, 6-0, Jr.); Justin Sogoian (C, 6-4, Sr.); Stan Wada (G, 5-8, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Cal Daniels (G, 5-10, Jr.); Brad Huss (C, 6-4, So.); Ryan Miller 
(F, 6-0, Sr.); Chris Puente (F, 6-0, Jr.); Li Riopelle (F, 5-10, Sr.); Chap Yam 
(G, 5-7, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The once-mighty Aztecs are still in the early stages of a rebuilding 
program. Perry said an optimistic goal is a third-place finish, though fourth 
is more realistic. "Defensively we are OK," Perry said. "We try to create a 
tempo to help our offense." The points in Perry's wide-open offense should come 
from Bennett, a second-team all-league selection last year, and Sogoian. Huss, 
who led the JV squad in scoring and rebounding last year, will provide 
much-needed height. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOS AMIGOS 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Clayton Olivier (first year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 1-20, 1-13 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Eddie Benson (G, 5-10, Jr.); Chris Blythe (C, 6-7, Jr.); Andy 
Frazier (G, 6-0, Sr.); Derrick Ragsdale (F, 5-10, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Raul Alvarado (F, 6-1, Sr.); Josh Cantu (F, 6-0, Sr.); Tim Clark 
(C, 6-6, So.); Mark Dillon (F, 6-2, So.); Brandon Douglas (C, 6-4, Sr.); Mike 
Hang (G, 5-8, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Olivier, a former all-league player for the Lobos, returns to Los 
Amigos to take over a team that finished in the cellar last season. One of his 
first moves was to dismiss senior forward Andre Roberson from the squad for 
disciplinary reasons. Without Roberson (10.4 rebounds per game last season), 
the Lobos have only two returning starters -- Benson and Blythe. They will be 
complemented by Ragsdale, who has impressed Olivier with his defensive skills, 
Frazier and Alvarado, whom Olivier calls "an animal on the boards." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PACIFICA 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Rhett Heckel (fifth year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 12-12, 9-5 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Five. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: One. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Kevin Gaughen (F, 6-5, Sr.); Scott Lesser (F, 6-1, Sr.); Larry 
Nagata (G, 5-9, Sr.); Brian Showalter (C, 6-6, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Don Choi (G, 6-0, Sr.); Brian Hachiwa (G, 5-7, Sr.); Tim Rouleau 
(G, 5-11, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Mariners have lost three of their four nonleague/tournament games 
this season, but two of the defeats came against top-flight Brea-Olinda and St. 
John Bosco. "If we are intense defensively, we should be competitive with 
anybody," Heckel said. The middle will be sealed by Showalter, who Heckel said 
is the best all-around player on the team. Offensively, Heckel has 
sharpshooting Gaughen (24.7 points per game this season, including 30 against 
Brea) and Nagata (22.0 average this season). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RANCHO ALAMITOS 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Eric Hamamoto (second year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 21-4, 13-1 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: None. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Eric Moore (C, 6-5, Sr.); Chris Singletary (F, 6-2, Sr.); 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Nervanah Phonexay (G, 5-10, Jr.); Matt Roberts (C, 6-5, Sr.); 
Luther Tolbert (F, 5-8, Jr.); Ulysses Trammell (G, 5-9, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Hamamoto is a bit short on experienced personnel, but he has a good 
group of players that should make the Vaqueros genuine contenders. One of the 
keys to Rancho's offense will be how well Trammell, the tailback who led all 
county rushers with 1,548 yards this football season, runs the Vaqueros' fast 
break. Moore and Singletary (200 pounds each) lend some bulk up front. Phonexay 
is averaging 23 points per game in nonleague games this year (he had 34 against 
La Habra) and is the team's primary young gun. Defensively, Rancho will go with 
a full-court press. "It's a style that I've always been happy with," Hamamoto 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Paul Anderson (fourth year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 8-14, 4-10 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Three. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: One. Top returners: Mike Carrasco (F, 6-0, Jr.); Con Nguyen 
(G, 5-6, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Juan Castro (G, 5-8, Jr.); Joe Huelskamp (F, 5-11, Sr.); Juan 
Soriano (C, 6-1, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Anderson faces the same predicament as last year -- only one returning 
starter (Carrasco) and lack of height. "We'll give people problems with our 
quickness," he said. "This is one of the best shooting squads I've ever had. I 
have four or five guys capable of scoring 20 points on any given night."

RANCHO SANTIAGO PUTS MOORPARK IN ITS PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A meeting between teams ranked first and seventh in the state should be a great 
game, and it was -- for the team ranked No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Defending state champion and top-ranked Rancho Santiago worked a devastating 
inside-outside game, making five dunks and 12 three-point baskets, as well as 
virtually everything in between, Thursday night against seventh-ranked 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons blew Moorpark out, 99-75, in a championship semifinal game of the 
Crown City Classic at Pasadena City College and left no doubt as to who is No. 
1 at this juncture. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist called the loss, which snapped his team's 
school-record 10-game winning streak, "an old-fashioned spanking. We got our 
fannies kicked." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (12-2) came in riding high but could not handle Rancho Santiago's 
power down low. Erik Martin, a 6-foot-6 transfer from Texas Christian, made 
eight of 10 from the field and scored 18 points. Corie Blount, a 6-9 center, 
added 13, and the two combined for 19 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Pagett, son of Rancho Santiago Coach Dana Pagett and a transfer from UC 
Irvine, prowled the perimeter, making seven of nine three-point shots and 
finishing with a game-high 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Pagett shot us out of the game," Nordquist said. "He just drilled us." With 
Moorpark's guards attempting to help down low, Rancho Santiago (12-1) made 12 
of 22 three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was those guys' birthdays," Moorpark's Sam Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
Damian Wilson led Moorpark with 17 points. Aaron Smith scored 14, and Crawford 
had 13 with eight assists. Sean Doyle added 10, but Moorpark's starting 
forwards, Mike Waggoner and Jimmy Galbert, managed to combine for only 10. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark led in the first 10 minutes, but Rancho Santiago never trailed after 
pulling ahead, 19-16 on a three-point basket by Pagett before the 10-minute 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
Waggoner, Wilson and Doyle all picked up three first-half fouls, and Rancho 
Santiago gradually increased the margin to 48-34 at the break. 
</P>
<P>
Waggoner made the first shot of the second half to close the gap to 48-36 but 
was promptly charged with his fourth foul on a three-point play by Martin. 
</P>
<P>
That ignited a 26-9 Rancho Santiago run in the next eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we could come back," Nordquist said. "I didn't expect them to blow 
us out. They opened up the first 10 minutes of the second half with great 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark fell even deeper into foul trouble in the face of the onslaught. 
Wilson notched his fourth foul at 17:22, and Doyle fouled out at 10:34. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago rolled, expanding its lead to as much as 33 points before 
Moorpark scored 15 of the game's final 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played well tonight," Dana Pagett said. "It was a tight game in 
the first half. We just caught a real hot streak in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's only other loss of the season was to West Valley, currently ranked 
third in the state.

MILLER HITS NINE THREE-POINTERS, EDISON GIRLS FINISH IN FIFTH PLACE

<P>
Erika Miller made nine three-point baskets and scored 43 points to lead Edison 
High School to a 73-32 victory over Los Amigos Thursday in a fifth-place game 
of the Savanna girls' basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's nine three-pointers were one short of the Southern Section record, 
accomplished twice last season by former teammate Debbie Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
Angie Cole of Royal also made 10 in a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking to shoot (three-pointers) because there was nobody guarding me 
-- they played a zone," Miller said. "So the coach told me to keep shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Joan Paje added two three-pointers to help set a school team record of 
11 in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a 5-6 senior, is averaging 24.2 points and has connected on 22 of 51 
three-point attempts this season. Edison is 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
In other Savanna tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Loara 42, Newport Harbor 31 -- Tracy Titus scored 19 points and Stephanie 
Wright added 12 points to lead Loara (4-3). 
</P>
<P>
Savanna 58, Torrey Pines 36 -- Carrie Frederick had 22 points, Stacey Aliff 18 
and Sara Works added 14 to lead Savanna (7-0) in a championship semifinal.

TUSTIN, WITHOUT BEILSTEIN, LOSES FIRST GAME OF SEASON 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tustin High School, playing without its top scorer, David Beilstein, lost its 
first basketball game of the season Thursday night, falling in the 
quarterfinals of the Tournament of Champions at Ocean View High. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Long Beach Poly took advantage of Beilstein's absence and 
scored a 62-51 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't execute in the last three minutes and had trouble handling the ball 
against their good athletes," Tustin Coach Tom McCluskey said. "They deserved 
to win. I don't want to make excuses after a loss like that." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Beilstein's presence likely would have made a difference. Beilstein, who 
stayed home with the flu, averages 22 points per game, hits 52% from 
three-point range and makes 57% of his two-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin (5-1), missing Beilstein's ballhandling skills, committed 15 turnovers 
in a ragged performance. Still, the Tillers were tied, 50-50, with three 
minutes remaining when Poly guard Tyus Edney broke the game open. 
</P>
<P>
Edney, who has signed with UCLA, scored eight of his 20 points in the fourth 
last quarter, including six free throws in the final 56 seconds of play. He 
also ran a flawless delay game down the stretch that frustrated Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Yikeem Craddock led Poly (4-1) in the first three quarters, scoring 16 
of the Jackrabbits' 41 points and making 8 of 10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Yikeem carried us in the first half and Tyus took over in the fourth quarter," 
said Ron Palmer, Long Beach Poly coach. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin's loss left only three undefeated schools in the county -- Estancia, 
Irvine and Edison -- after two weeks of play. Poly's victory set up a rematch 
with Mater Dei in tonight's semifinals at 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
Poly defeated Mater Dei, 54-47, in the championship game of last year's 
tournament, and Mater Dei came back to beat Poly in the Southern California 
Division I regional final. 
</P>
<P>
Poly has won the championship of the tournament three times and Mater Dei has 
won the title four times in the past 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 57, Pasadena 56 -- Forward Keith Boldon made two free throws with 
24 seconds remaining to give Los Alamitos (5-3) a three-point lead, then the 
Griffins hung on for the victory in the consolation quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena (2-5) cut the deficit to 57-56 when forward Lydell Hill scored on a 
jumper with five second remaining. Boldon finished with 15 points, his best 
game since scoring 42 points against University in the Trabuco Hills 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"They eliminated us in the CIF (Southern Section) playoffs last year, so this 
was a good win for us," Los Alamitos Coach Steve Brooks said. "Boldon really 
gave us a lift tonight."

Brett Pagett set a single-game record for Rancho Santiago College with seven 
three-pointers in a 99-75 victory over Moorpark in the semifinals of the 
Pasadena Tournament Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Pagett was seven of nine from three-point range and nine of 11 overall. 
</P>
<P>
He surpassed the record of six, which was set by Kenny Ammann (1988) and Gene 
Altamirano, who did it twice last season. Pagett also had six assists.

Fresh off a trip to a Division I land of giants, the Chapman College basketball 
team returned home Thursday night ready to fatten up on its own little guy. But 
Occidental wasn't buying it. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental, a Division III school in Eagle Rock, played a plodding half-court 
game and led by a point at halftime. Chapman eventually pulled away for an 
83-63 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Division II Chapman played two games on the road against Division 
I teams, losing to No. 12 Louisiana State, 101-68, and defeating McNeese State, 
65-64. 
</P>
<P>
Returning for their first home game in nearly three weeks, the Panthers (5-3) 
played sluggishly in the first half. Occidental (2-3) was fueled by 50% 
shooting from the field in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
When Brett Dennis hit a three-pointer with 32 seconds remaining in the half, it 
gave Occidental a 35-34 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the reason for what seemed to be a casual start," Chapman Coach 
Bob Boyd said. "I'm not sure why that happens." 
</P>
<P>
Frantz Reyes, who made only one of his five first-half shots, said he thought 
the Panthers were falling victim to the David vs. Goliath syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
"Since this was a Division III team, I think we were just thinking we were 
going to win," Reyes said. "At halftime we realized that they can win, so we 
had to come out in the second half and play just as hard as them." 
</P>
<P>
Boyd said he told his team something similar at halftime, and Reyes opened the 
half with three consecutive baskets to give the Panthers a 40-38 lead. Chapman 
never relinquished the lead, and Reyes' baskets were the start of a 29-7 run. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a full-court press, called for by Boyd with 12:45 remaining, that 
really got the Panthers going. 
</P>
<P>
The press started after Rog Middleton made two free throws to give Chapman a 
50-45 lead. Chuck McGavran immediately stole the ball, and though Chapman 
immediately turned the ball over itself, the game's pace had been picked up. 
</P>
<P>
Middleton's free throws began a 15-0 run that gave the Panthers a 63-45 lead 
with 9:12 left. 
</P>
<P>
The faster pace also freed up Middleton, who had been held to six points on 
three-for-four shooting in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
During the run, Middleton scored 11 consecutive points, two coming on a 
resounding dunk after Zlatko Josic got the ball to him on a perfect touch pass 
from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Middleton had 17 in the second half and 23 for the game. Andre Hill, who made 
his first four shots of the game, kept Chapman close in the first half. Hill, 
who made six of nine first-half shots, finished with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental cut the deficit to nine points when Blair Slattery, who led the 
Tigers with 15 points, hit a three-pointer with 7:35 left. But the Tigers got 
no closer.

RETAIL SALES DROP 0.1% IN NOVEMBER AS CAUTION REIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a fresh sign of how tight holiday shoppers' pocketbooks have gotten, the 
federal government reported Thursday that retail sales fell 0.1% in November 
from the month before. 
</P>
<P>
The retail sales total, at a seasonally adjusted $151.6 billion, was up 3.4% 
from weak November, 1989, results. But with inflation running at more than 6% 
this year, it means that most merchants are doing less -- or no more -- 
business than in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not what a number of retailers were looking for, but we have to 
understand that we're probably in a recession," said Rosalind Wells, chief 
economist of the National Retail Federation trade group. She called the sales 
total "a recession-type number." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Commerce Department figures were better than many economists 
expected, given the weak sales reports released by major retailers last week. A 
Dow Jones survey had forecast a monthly decline of 0.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Also, car sales -- which depressed the November retail sales total -- staged a 
big, though possibly misleading, rebound in early December, auto makers 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The figures, however, did little to change the growing opinion that the economy 
has sunk into a recession and that consumers have grown increasingly cautious. 
Retailing analysts predicted that department stores and specialty shops will 
enjoy a surge of business in the days before Christmas, but not enough to turn 
around what so far has been a dismal holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
They also said that, to drum up business, more retailers will follow such 
giants as Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and Toys R Us in offering more and deeper 
price cuts on holiday merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
The weak figures reported by the Commerce Department were blamed on worries 
about the Persian Gulf crisis, rising unemployment, declining consumer 
confidence and rising energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Americans are laying out so much more money at the gas pump and on home 
heating oil that their discretionary buying power is substantially reduced," 
said Kurt Barnard, publisher of the Retail Marketing Report newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a strong feeling across the country that it's more prudent so save 
financial resources than to spend them." 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to buy less than they did in the past year, and they'll spend 
less on what they will buy," Barnard added. 
</P>
<P>
One of the likely results: more retailing bankruptcies, said Carl Steidtmann, 
chief economist for the retail consulting firm Management Horizons. Along with 
the companies burdened with junk bond debts, he said, the list of failures 
likely will include retail chains that simply can no longer make enough money 
to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
The retail sales drop, following a revised 0.2% gain in October, was the first 
monthly decline since May. 
</P>
<P>
Among the few comparatively bright spots was the apparel specialty store 
category, where sales were up 0.8% from October and 2.3% -- before accounting 
for inflation -- from a year ago. Gasoline dealer sales climbed 0.7% from 
October and 21.6% from a year earlier, largely as a result of increased prices 
amid the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Drugstore sales also climbed, up 0.2% from October and 8.4% from November, 
1989. Furniture sales rose 0.3% from October, but were down 1.7% from last 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the weakness came at home improvement stores, where seasonally adjusted 
sales totals were down 2.6% from October and 5.2% from a year ago. At 
department stores, seasonally adjusted sales fell 0.2% from October but rose 
1.1% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Auto sales, a major component of the government figures, were down 1.3% from 
the month before and little changed from a year ago. Eliminating the auto sales 
category, retail sales in November posted a 0.2% gain from October and a 4.3% 
increase from November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the 10 companies producing cars and trucks in the United States 
reported a 22.3% sales increase during the first 10 days of December, versus 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts and auto executives said the increase, coming while U.S. auto 
makers are cutting production and losing money, does not reflect the true 
weakness of the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year's period was extremely weak," said Joel Pitcoff, a sales analyst at 
Ford Motor Co. "It was a worse 10-day period than anything we've seen this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Car sales were up 27.8%, and truck sales rose 14.3% from last year. The Big 
Three auto makers reported a 29.3% sales increase in domestically made cars, 
while sales of Japanese "transplants" increased 14.2%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's somewhat refreshing that the number wasn't as bad as the 10-day period 
that ended out November," said Clifford Swenson, an economist at Economic 
Planning &amp; Consulting in New York. But when late November's weak showing is 
averaged with early December's, Swenson said, "the figure is right in line with 
the overall trend in the market, which for the fourth quarter is fairly extreme 
weakness. And that extreme weakness should persist at least for the next couple 
of months." 
</P>
<P>
Luxury car sales -- widely expected to show a sharp increase before the 10% 
excise tax on cars costing more than $30,000 begins Jan. 1 -- failed to meet 
expectations, dealers and analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Americans bought 137,024 U.S.-built cars Dec. 1 to 10, a 28% rise. This 
included a 29% gain at General Motors and a 32% increase at Ford. Chrysler 
sales climbed 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Among Japanese-based manufacturers, only Honda posted a decline, a drop of 32%. 
Mazda rose 105%, Nissan 81%, Toyota 47% and Mitsubishi 35%.

CASTLE &amp; COOKE WILL NOT SELL DOLE AFTER ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. LA GANGA and TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a surprise announcement, officials at Castle &amp; Cooke Inc. said Thursday 
that they will not sell Dole Food Co. after all, capping a contentious 19 
months of on-again, off-again negotiations to sell or spin off the produce 
giant. 
</P>
<P>
Reasons ranged from the deteriorating market for acquisitions and financing to 
Dole's increasingly strong performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Although several major international food companies expressed interest in 
acquiring Dole, in the current economic climate the Board of Directors did not 
believe the interested buyers were prepared to pay a price that fully reflected 
the company's potential," Castle &amp; Cooke Chairman David H. Murdock said in 
a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
One major West Coast fund manager argued that Murdock will sell Dole 
eventually. "This is not the end of the story," this money manager said, 
declining to allow his name to be used. "The interest that Murdock saw in Dole 
(from potential buyers) indicates that something's got to happen down the 
road," the money manager said. 
</P>
<P>
Dole spokeswoman Carol J. Klein declined to identify possible bidders or 
comment on the potential for a future sale. Analysts said Chiquita Brands 
International of Cincinnati had offered about $2.16 billion for Dole. Other 
interested companies named were Procter &amp; Gamble of Cincinnati and Sumitomo 
of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiquita bid was "a low-ball price" because the company is valued at $2.5 
billion to $3 billion, said Randy Havre, president of J. B. Havre Securities, a 
Honolulu brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Castle &amp; Cooke is the parent company of Dole Food and 
Oceanic Properties Inc. of Honolulu. Its stock closed at $33.625 on the New 
York Stock Exchange Thursday, down $0.375 from Wednesday's trading. The 
announcement was made after the market closed. 
</P>
<P>
"You will see a selloff on the (Castle &amp; Cooke) stock," Havre predicted 
Thursday, "because of the people in there for speculative reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Greenblatt, partner at investment firm Baker, Nye Investments in New 
York, estimated that Castle &amp; Cooke is worth $46 to $48 a share if the food 
and real estate units are fairly valued. Because the stock has been trading 
around $33.625 -- rather than closer to the company's potential value -- Wall 
Street's disappointment isn't likely to be so great, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that the stock will fall back to the high $20 range, which would 
become "an attractive level" for investors who wanted to buy for Castle's 
long-term earnings potential. The stock traded as low as $26.25 in October, 
when it last appeared that Castle was having trouble peddling Dole. 
</P>
<P>
Several money managers who own the stock applauded Murdock's decision to take 
Dole off the market rather than sell at a cheap price, even if the stock price 
falls temporarily. "It's a business you should only sell when you can get the 
price it deserves," said one money manager, requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
One probable obstacle to getting that good price is the potential sale of 
competitor Del Monte by troubled British conglomerate Polly Peck. Potential 
buyers of Dole may figure that they can get a much better deal for Del Monte. 
</P>
<P>
Castle &amp; Cooke announced in May, 1989, that it would spin off Dole to 
create separate corporate identities for its food and real estate subsidiaries 
in an effort to better finance both segments' growth. 
</P>
<P>
But tight credit and slow government approval put a roadblock in Castle &amp; 
Cooke's progress, and in May, 1990, the company announced that the spinoff was 
in trouble. Two months later, Castle &amp; Cooke said that it had been 
contacted by "several major companies" interested in buying Dole. 
</P>
<P>
And Thursday, the company shifted gears again and took the "For Sale" down. The 
proposed spin off is also on indefinite hold, Klein said. Castle &amp; Cooke 
also said Thursday that that it will pay a regular quarterly dividend of 10 
cents a share -- its first dividend since April, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Dole's revenue was $2.55 billion in 1989, up from $2.3 billion in 1988. Dole is 
the dominant worldwide producer and distributor of fresh produce, the world's 
largest pineapple producer and No. 2 in bananas and citrus.

FCC WOULD LET SOME CITIES REGULATE BASIC CABLE TV;

GOVERNMENT: THE AGENCY'S PROPOSALS ARE IN RESPONSE TO A RISING TIDE OF 
COMPLAINTS ABOUT PRICE HIKES.

<P>
The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday proposed new rules that could 
return to some cities the right to regulate basic cable television rates. 
</P>
<P>
Under existing rules, only about 3% of the nation's 9,500-plus cable TV systems 
are under price restraints, and there have been rising complaints that cable 
systems raise prices willy-nilly and get away with poor service. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new rules, adopted on a 5-0 vote, would make it tougher for cable 
systems to avoid price regulation, while at the same time avoiding what FCC 
officials view as heavy-handed controls. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal says local communities may regulate a cable system's "basic tier" 
of services, which includes network broadcast stations, unless one of the three 
following conditions exist: 
</P>
<P>
* There are six or more unduplicated over-the-air channels available and the 
cable system is subscribed to by less than 50% of the TV homes in a community. 
</P>
<P>
* There are other multichannel service providers in the community, such as 
microwave cable or direct broadcast satellites, that are available to 50% of 
the homes with cable and are actually being subscribed to by 10% of those 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
* The cable system offers a minimum level of service and programs at a 
reasonable price that is comparable to communities in which there is effective 
competition. This so-called good actor clause is favored by a number of FCC 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
FCC officials would not speculate on how many cable systems could avoid rate 
re-regulation under the new proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals could affect parts of Los Angeles and Orange counties where cable 
penetration is above the 50% level. 
</P>
<P>
Following a period of public comment, the commission will adopt final rules 
sometime next year.

FCC WOULD LET SOME CITIES REGULATE CABLE TV; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: THE AGENCY'S PROPOSALS ARE IN RESPONSE TO A RISING TIDE OF 
COMPAINTS ABOUT PRICE HIKES.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday proposed new rules that could 
return to some cities the right to regulate basic cable television rates. 
</P>
<P>
Under existing rules, only about 3% of the nation's 9,500-plus cable TV systems 
are under price restraints, and there have been rising complaints that cable 
systems raise prices willy-nilly and get away with poor service. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new rules, adopted on a 5-0 vote, would make it tougher for cable 
systems to avoid price regulation, while at the same time avoiding what FCC 
officials view as heavy-handed controls. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal says local communities may regulate a cable system's "basic tier" 
of services, which includes network broadcast stations, unless one of the three 
following conditions exist: 
</P>
<P>
* There are six or more unduplicated over-the-air channels available and the 
cable system is subscribed to by less than 50% of the TV homes in a community. 
</P>
<P>
* There are other multichannel service providers in the community, such as 
microwave cable or direct broadcast satellites, that are available to 50% of 
the homes with cable and are actually being subscribed to by 10% of those 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
* The cable system offers a minimum level of service and programs at a 
reasonable price that is comparable to communities in which there is effective 
competition. This so-called good actor clause is favored by a number of FCC 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
FCC officials would not speculate on how many cable systems could avoid rate 
re-regulation under the new proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals could affect parts of Los Angeles and Orange counties where cable 
penetration is above the 50% level. 
</P>
<P>
Following a period of public comment, the commission will adopt final rules 
sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
FCC Chairman Alfred C. Sikes said the proposals would "give some measure of 
consumer protection . . . and some assurance of fairness" to the cable TV 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Sikes has championed competition among cable systems and satellite broadcasters 
as a means of guaranteeing continued growth in the cable industry and holding 
prices down for subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
National Cable Television Assn. President James Mooney, however, said the FCC 
proposals could hurt the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
"However moderate the intentions of the FCC, this proposal raises the prospect 
of the government inhibiting the future development of cable programming by 
crimping its economic life blood," Mooney said. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, 
said the rules don't get at the root problem: pricing for the most popular 
cable programs, such as ESPN, the Turner networks and Discovery Channel, which 
cable systems typically don't offer on the basic tier. 
</P>
<P>
"This will offer only the slightest protection for consumers and still leave 
them totally at the mercy of cable operators for the most popular programs," 
Kimmelman said.

U.S. JOINS HUGHES WHISTLE-BLOWER SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Justice joined a whistle-blower lawsuit against Hughes 
Aircraft Co. on Thursday, alleging that the company overcharged the government 
by $5 million during the early 1980s by switching charges among contracts for 
radar systems. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, brought under the federal False Claims Act, was originally filed in 
May, 1989, by John N. Perron Jr., who continues to work at Hughes' radar 
systems group in El Segundo, said Perron's attorney, Dean Francis Pace. 
</P>
<P>
A Hughes spokesman denied the allegations and said the case was unwarranted. It 
is the first time the Justice Department has entered a whistle-blower case 
against Hughes. Of three prior False Claims suits against Hughes, one has been 
dropped, one is expected to be dropped and the third is continuing without 
Justice Department participation, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Perron alleges in his suit that from 1981 through 1985, the firm's 
environmental test laboratory in El Segundo falsified employee time records and 
concealed a fraudulent charging scheme in which costs that should have been 
billed to a fixed-price contract were instead billed to a cost-plus contract. 
By that means, the government was forced to bear the excess costs, the suit 
alleges. 
</P>
<P>
The fixed price contracts were for the F-14, F-15 and F-18 radar systems. The 
cost-plus contract was for the Roland missile system. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that the company destroyed time cards prepared by employees, 
altered other time cards and demanded employees sign blank time cards that were 
later used to make false entries. 
</P>
<P>
In a second allegation, Perron said the company continued to submit charges for 
the four programs at a time in 1986 when the Air Force had refused to accept 
deliveries of missiles from Hughes and there was a suspension of production.

THE NEW MODELS; 
</P>
<P>
UNCONVENTIONAL LOOKS ARE IN VOGUE ON THE RUNWAY AND IN PHOTO LAYOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM KISSEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Kissel is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to The Times fashion pages. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture a fashion layout with these models: Sebastian is tall, black, and looks 
androgynous. Yvette is a Latina with a distinctive nose. Evan, has a crew cut, 
and tattoos cover half his body. 
</P>
<P>
These are three of the many unconventional faces that have come out of 
California model agencies in the last several years. Such young talents are in 
high demand and can earn up to $100,000 per year for looking different than the 
standard fashion model. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the modeling industry is in the midst of a transformation. Beauty is 
still the heart of the business. But today, beauty is in the eye of the 
beholder, and the good, the bad, and the unconventional can walk designer 
runways and grace the pages of magazines such as Vogue, Elle and Mademoiselle. 
</P>
<P>
The trend has been intensifying since 1985, when pudgy, bespectacled -- even 
balding -- models turned up in shows of top-notch European designers such as 
Jean Paul Gaultier in Paris and Franco Moschino in Milan. About the same time, 
magazines such as Details and L.A. Style started opting for more extreme 
fashion pictorials, with models who looked more like real people. Then came a 
spate of fashion ad campaigns from Benetton, Esprit and The Gap, using people 
who looked more like character actors than fashion models. 
</P>
<P>
Many maintain the trend was created by Paris-based Japanese designer Issey 
Miyake. "Miyake really started it 10 years ago when he showed his collection in 
Japan using older Japanese people who weren't necessarily models, " recalls 
Larry Chrysler, a California retailer and manufacturer for 34 years and an 
independent fashion consultant for the last four. "Now it's fairly common for 
designers to choose models they feel consumers can identify with. They are no 
longer confined to using billboard-type faces." 
</P>
<P>
Fashion photographers have encouraged the trend, as they exercise growing 
control over the models they use and the pictures they take. Often, they prefer 
to use non-models. 
</P>
<P>
Photographer Bruce Weber, for example, has used youthful Santa Monica surfers 
and American Indians for a number of Calvin Klein ads; Herb Ritts discovered 
Tony Ward (featured in Madonna's new, banned-from-MTV "Justify My Love" video) 
while doing a series of pseudo-erotic underwear photos for L.A. Style magazine; 
and Philip Dixon showed exotic-looking models with exaggerated features for 
Body Glove and other local clothing company ads. Weber is based in New York; 
Ritts and Dixon live in Los Angeles. But, "It was the European photographers 
who came to California that started it all," says model-turned-photographer 
Carlos Reynosa of Los Angeles, who shoots for Mademoiselle, Interview and 
Rolling Stone, among other magazines. "They discovered the ethnic diversity of 
Los Angeles and took advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
Reynosa says interest in ethnic models was limited 10 years ago when he spent 
his days in front of the camera, not behind it. "Now the industry is much more 
open," he says. When I started taking pictures in 1984, I received immediate 
acceptance using ethnic models." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, model agencies are eager to fill the demand for 
non-conventional faces. Many Los Angeles agencies schedule "open calls" every 
other week when 200 to 300 wanna-bes show up, vying for the chance to make from 
$50 an hour (for editorial work) to $5,000 a day (for some advertising 
campaigns). 
</P>
<P>
The agencies cast models for everything from newspaper, magazine and billboard 
ads to television commercials. They promote models with large noses, 
exaggerated sideburns, tattoos, even crooked teeth, and are discovering that it 
pays to specialize in the eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
Omar's Men, It Models, Hero, Prima East West, L.A. Models and Elite's New Faces 
division are just a few of the agencies helping to, quite literally, change the 
face of modeling by specializing in clients from diverse ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Omar Albertto owns Omar's Men, which specializes in male models with strong, 
ethnic looks and plenty of attitude; a handful are former gang members. He 
looks for the man with a compelling face. "I don't mean Ken doll looks," he 
says. "He can have a big nose or exaggerated big lips. Or maybe his teeth 
aren't lined up, but he has a great smile. Fashion is coming from the streets 
today. So why not use people from the streets to model them?" 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Albertto has been so successful with his approach that he recently 
opened a sister agency, It Models. Using a similar philosophy for women, 
co-owner Paul Fisher says, has proven successful. Last year, the agencies had a 
combined yearly income of about $15 million, the owners say. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the move away from strictly Anglo models, most department stores adhere 
to a "3-to-1 ratio" (three Anglos to every ethnic model) for their ads. But 
some store executives say they are using more ethnic models for in-store 
fashion shows, in part to keep up with trends. 
</P>
<P>
"With the shifting monetary distribution to minority groups in America, the 
smart companies are starting to target these groups," says Ray Wills, a vice 
president of Macy's California. One way to do so, he adds, is to hire a greater 
number of ethnic models. 
</P>
<P>
Store fashion shows rely more heavily on an ethnic mix of models because there 
are increasingly more people of color in the audience. "People watching a 
fashion show don't have to guess if something would look good on them," Willis 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Ad directors for better specialty stores, fashion magazine art directors, even 
the designers themselves are clearly opting for greater variety. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not necessary that we use 'GQ'-type models," says L.A. designer Richard 
Tyler, who has been a strong advocate of hiring unusual-looking models for his 
shows and ads. "We usually like women with a little more exotic look, and men 
with goatees, beards. They can even be bald." What is Tyler's limit? "It's 
important that the models not be too weird, or they detract from the clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Strong as the trend toward non-conventional faces may be at the moment, Bill 
Arndt, a modeling agent for more than 15 years and owner of a new Los 
Angeles-based agency, Hero, sees it as a passing fancy. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth of the matter is the classic, All-American good looks are still the 
big moneymakers," Arndt says. "The ethnic models certainly have a place in the 
business. But it's not a long-range thing. Clients get tired of the traditional 
good looks and start looking for unusual models every couple of years. But they 
always come back." 
</P>
<P>
Arndt's agency does accommodate clients looking for ethnic and exotic-looking 
models. But, he adds, those models "certainly don't pay the rent. I keep the 
unusual looking models around simply to keep up with the trends." 
</P>
<P>
Super agent Nina Blanchard agrees that some old standards still apply. 
</P>
<P>
A fixture in the industry since 1961, with a famous agency that bears her name, 
Blanchard explains: "There is certainly a much broader range of models working 
today. For the past six years we've seen a lot more interesting faces out 
there. But there are still some criteria for models. She has to be 5-foot-9 to 
6 feet, she has to be between the ages of 15 to 20 to start, and she has to be 
photogenic." Fifty percent of her models no longer fall into the classic mold. 
</P>
<P>
In the modeling industry's new exotic age, there are new taboos. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything fake is not what it's about," says Fisher of It Models. "Lip 
implants, boob jobs and peroxided hair are all turnoffs. The modeling industry 
today is about inner beauty. We're looking for an ethereal quality you can't 
get from a plastic surgeon." 
</P>
<P>
This being Hollywood, many modeling agents contend the new exoticism has 
evolved in strong part from a film industry preference for leading actors with 
unconventional good looks. 
</P>
<P>
"The leading men are guys like Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke," Albertto notes. 
</P>
<P>
He adds that biker dress (leather jackets, engineer boots), a dominant theme in 
fashion right now, has also encouraged the new definition of beauty. "Almost 
50% of our guys have tattoos now," Albertto says. "Some of the girls do, too."

<P>
At the end of each year, we newspaper people try to avoid productive work by 
going back into our files and notes to produce lists of the best this-and-that 
for the past year. It's tough to find a niche to crawl into here because most 
of them are already spoken for. 
</P>
<P>
But I've staked my claim on the best quotes of the year originating in or 
spoken about Orange County. I have divided these into categories so you can 
follow them more easily. The fact that they are taken outrageously out of 
context was not a factor in the judging. 
</P>
<P>
Most Honest (three-way tie) 
</P>
<P>
The late Eddie Martin, at the dedication of the terminal bearing his name: 
After listening to various politicians and other officials emote, he said: "I 
don't know what the hell I'm doing up here following these guys." 
</P>
<P>
The "Talking Nixon," at his Yorba Linda museum when asked why a hostile press 
wanted him out of office: "Because I had a mandate to reorganize the 
government. I was going to shape up the place. They knew it -- and they didn't 
like it." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Edwards, chairman of Edwards Cinema, being questioned about why he turned 
down a booking of "Last Exit to Brooklyn" at his Lido theater without having 
viewed it first: "I don't see any pictures before we open them." 
</P>
<P>
Most Hopeful 
</P>
<P>
Howard Adler, former chairman of the Orange County Democratic Party and recent 
candidate for the state Assembly: "If the Soviet Union and Nicaragua and 
Eastern Europe can throw off the yoke of the one-party system, so can Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
Most Enlightening (two-way tie) 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Carson): "There is some Orange County bashing 
going on in the Assembly, and I'm enjoying the hell out of it. The 
silk-stocking guys are going to be taking their lumps because, quite frankly, 
this is just retribution for their activities in voting everything down. 
They're all Neanderthals." 
</P>
<P>
Norma McCorvey ("Jane Roe" in Roe vs. Wade) after living for six months in 
Orange County: "I never felt comfortable here because the culture seems so 
close to Dallas -- and I want to get as far away from Dallas as I possibly 
can." 
</P>
<P>
Most Creative (two-way tie) 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-La Habra) answering complaints about the building 
of toll roads in Orange County: "We'll elevate the roadways in Orange County, 
run a garden hose under them and call them a bridge. That way, all you Northern 
California hypocrites can be satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Robert Bennett of the U.S. Senate Ethics Committee, exasperated at the 
circular testimony of Joy Jacobsen, Sen. Alan Cranston's chief fund-raiser: "If 
I'm sitting on a park bench and an 800-pound gorilla comes up and says, 'Excuse 
me, are there any seats around here?' he's got my seat. There is a repeated 
pattern here of action being taken on behalf of Mr. Keating right before or 
right after you and the senator are asking for large sums of money to be 
donated." 
</P>
<P>
Most Heartwarming (two-way tie) 
</P>
<P>
Charles H. Keating Jr., in a statement made through his attorney after hearing 
about the man who killed himself after his life savings -- dedicated to abused 
children -- were lost in the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan debacle: "Mr. Keating 
feels deep sorrow and compassion, but when the evidence is all in, it will be 
found that Mr. Keating did not bring about the collapse of the American savings 
and loan industry." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Republican Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes at the dedication of the 
Nixon Library at Yorba Linda: "This is an occasion that absolutely brings tears 
of joy to my eyes because Richard Nixon is finally being given credit and 
acknowledgement that he deserves." 
</P>
<P>
Most Profound 
</P>
<P>
Worker on a garbage truck in Newport Beach after finding $42,500 in cash that 
was thrown out with the trash by a local bank: "I wouldn't want to be a trash 
man anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>

"Sheriff Gates could not be reached for comment."

AFTER THE COLD WAR; 
</P>
<P>
SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL EXAMINES THE LATEST STAGE OF U.S. POLITICS 
</P>

<P>
What if they ended a war and nobody noticed? 
</P>
<P>
Herein lies the premise of political analyst Sidney Blumenthal's chronicle of 
the 1988 presidential campaign, which he says was lived "as if the Cold War 
were raging and Stalin alive." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite the war being declared over -- by "Cold Warrior" Ronald Reagan 
five months before the election -- George Bush and Michael Dukakis waged 
campaigns that focused on national security. 
</P>
<P>
To Blumenthal, that was a huge mistake. He thinks "the public was ready for 
some risk" and was already seeing tried-and-true politics as "old and 
outmoded." 
</P>
<P>
In his new book, "Pledging Allegiance: The Last Campaign of the Cold War," 
Blumenthal, 42, examines what he believes is the failure of Bush and Dukakis to 
acknowledge a new world stage with different players. He says they desperately 
clung to irrelevant issues. 
</P>
<P>
The book's jacket design -- juxtaposed photographs of a campaigning Bush at a 
flag factory in New Jersey and a campaigning Dukakis in flak suit and helmet 
aboard an M1 tank at a factory in Michigan -- pretty much sums up Blumenthal's 
jaundiced view of U.S. politics-as-usual while one of the great revolutions in 
history was under way in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential campaign was largely a contest to prove which man was "100% 
American," he says. "Pledging Allegiance" refers to Bush's castigation of 
Dukakis for not supporting mandatory pledges by public school children. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal, in a recent interview, assessed Bush as a politician for whom the 
Nixon presidency was a model. Bush won, he contends, largely "by arousing fear 
about the future." This was the same tough-on-crime, tough-on-communism stance 
that has served Republicans well since the end of World War II, Blumenthal 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Bush condemned Dukakis for being a card-carrying member of the ACLU and hit 
hard on Dukakis' stance on crime. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic, Blumenthal contends, that it was Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to 
power in the Soviet Union -- once dubbed by Ronald Reagan the "evil empire" -- 
that rescued Reagan's presidency from the shadow of the Iran-Contra scandal, 
providing it with "a bravura last act." It also made it possible for Bush to be 
elected, he says. 
</P>
<P>
And the Democrats -- who had planned a campaign based on Reagan's incompetence, 
and a need for change -- found themselves dealing with a voting public that was 
getting a change; Bush, who didn't really believe that the Cold War was ending, 
was now the candidate of peace. Dukakis did not grasp the implications, 
Blumenthal says, and "the floor underneath him began to disappear." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, he believes, was a "very lucky" man, suddenly able "to present himself as 
the foreign-policy wise man," says Blumenthal, a senior editor at New Republic 
magazine and a former Washington Post writer. During the campaign he wrote 
speeches for a cable TV series for Jack Tanner, a fictional presidential 
candidate invented by Blumenthal and his friend Garry Trudeau, creator of the 
"Doonesbury" comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal is not kind in his assessment of most of the real-life presidential 
hopefuls: 
</P>
<P>
* Dukakis was "a man for all vacuums . . . the candidate for the age of safe 
sex -- stable and steady, no peaks or valleys . . . the avoidance of 
intellectual risk became his strategic imperative." 
</P>
<P>
* Jack Kemp "seemed like Sinclair Lewis' 'Babbitt' reincarnated as a financial 
newsletter author." 
</P>
<P>
* Pat Robertson was bloated with "pretensions." 
</P>
<P>
* Jesse Jackson was a self-serving publicity-seeker with a need always to 
"dominate the stage," who ultimately did blacks a disservice. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Harper &amp; Row (now HarperCollins) approached Blumenthal about 
writing a kind of "The Making of the President, 1988" book, in a format 
popularized by author Theodore H. White. But Blumenthal was not enthusiastic. 
"I thought the genre had been played out," he said, adding that he "already had 
a sense the Cold War was ending" and that was the real book. 
</P>
<P>
Two years earlier, his friend Sergey Plekhanov, deputy director of Moscow's 
Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada Studies, had told him about "this person 
named Gorbachev" and his program for the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after the 1988 campaign, Blumenthal went to Moscow, accepting a 
standing invitation from Plekhanov to visit the institute, which Blumenthal 
describes as a place where "the Americanologists study us in the way our 
Kremlinologists study them." 
</P>
<P>
His book opens with a scene at the institute, which is housed in a mansion that 
was once the home of a czarist aristocrat. There, Soviet analysts "chuckled 
over the foibles of Gary Hart and Dan Quayle, shook their heads over Michael 
Dukakis' haplessness and expressed a cynical appreciation for George Bush's 
cynicism. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He found that they were consumed by the end of the Cold War and they were 
astonished at how U.S. political figures were ignoring it. 
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, dialogue on a post-Cold War world "would have been 
extremely helpful for the country," Blumenthal believes. As it is, he observes, 
the chief legacy of the Dukakis campaign was a belief that "you must always 
respond to negative campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the mediocrity of Campaign '88 -- a race that Blumenthal sees as 
symptomatic of a "morbid" system -- he does not believe that TV sound bites and 
paid political strategists necessarily dictate empty, humdrum politics. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal says it is hard to extract clear messages from the recent elections 
because they were held in the shadow of the Gulf crisis. Although the 
"throw-the-rascals-out" revolt that had been predicted did not take place, he 
believes "the public clearly is struggling with itself . . . it wants some 
change that it can't define." 
</P>
<P>
What's going on, he thinks, is that Americans are trying to deal with 
unsettling realities -- a middle class in trouble, a public education system in 
a mess, recession, a government paralyzed by social problems, the savings and 
loan scandal, worsening racial conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Of Gov.-elect Pete Wilson, Blumenthal says he "caught the mood of Californians 
-- status quo, plus. People want everything to stay the same, yet suddenly get 
better without anything changing. All benefits, no risks." 
</P>
<P>
Late 1990 is an "eerie interregnum," Blumenthal says, post-Cold War but 
pre-change. 
</P>
<P>
Change is inevitable, he says, because "sooner or later someone is going to 
connect the condition of the middle class to the status of America in the 
world." As the U.S. industrial base is demolished, as the nation's insolvency 
no longer permits it to make itself felt in the world as it once was, he says, 
the squeeze is on the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
He himself is from a middle-class family -- his father was a salesman in 
Chicago -- and he grew up believing that, in America, "anything was possible." 
Today, he says, "this sense of the American century is gone with the wind and 
the middle class is angry and confused and sometimes resentful, just as America 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal, who is currently writing a book about Secretary of State James 
Baker -- "one of the most important figures in American politics since Nixon" 
-- insists "I am not a radical pessimist." The problem, he says, is "absence of 
leadership. What we need is a Roosevelt, a Disraeli, someone who understands 
politics deeply."

SO WHAT'S THE BIG JOKE FOR TODAY?;

CHILDREN: WHAT KIDS THINK IS FUNNY DEPENDS ON THEIR AGE. AS A CHILD STRUGGLES 
TO DEVELOP NEW SKILLS, THE JOKES AND GAMES THAT TICKLE HIS FUNNY BONE CHANGE.

What makes children laugh tells us a great deal about what's on their minds and 
their level of development, according to Lawrence Kutner, a clinical 
psychologist and associate professor of public health at the University of 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"The specific things children laugh at tell us which developmental tasks they 
are struggling with," says Kutner, author of "Parent &amp; Child: Getting 
Through to Each Other" (William Morrow and Co., 1991, $18.95). "That explains 
why 3-year-olds, who are mastering toilet training, love bathroom humor. 
Seven-year-olds, who aren't worried about toilet training anymore, think 
'potty' jokes are just stupid." 
</P>
<P>
It also explains why peek-a-boo makes a toddler laugh. Kutner says babies learn 
some very complex things during their first year, including the fact that 
objects and people exist even when they can't be seen. While a baby is learning 
this, peek-a-boo is fraught with tension and excitement. He's pretty sure Mom 
is still there and will come back, but he's not certain. When she does 
reappear, the baby laughs with relief and glee. He can predict the future. What 
was scary is now fun. 
</P>
<P>
"But if Mom keeps her face hidden for too long," Kutner says, "the child's 
tension will turn to fear, and he'll cry." 
</P>
<P>
Once children grasp a new concept, they love to play with it. That's why 
2-year-olds go for combinations of words and nonsense syllables. "They've 
learned to tell the words from the nonsense," says Kutner. "Nonsense words are 
sounds that are out of place. They're funny." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, putting mittens on hands isn't funny. But putting a mitten on his 
nose is hysterical to a 2-year-old because he knows it doesn't belong there. 
He's done it on purpose to be silly. He's learned to make a joke. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-year-old, struggling to master logic and abstract ideas, finds riddles and 
jokes full of mismatched combinations, plays on words or logical flaws to be 
her favorites. "Why did the elephant wear blue sneakers?" "So he could hide in 
the blueberry bush." 
</P>
<P>
The elephant who thinks he can blend into the blueberries by making part of 
himself blue doesn't understand something that the child does. "It's a funny 
image to 6-year-olds because they can imagine and identify with the elephant 
who is trying in vain to hide," says Kutner. "The small child knows more than 
the big elephant." 
</P>
<P>
The innocent tone of children's jokes changes toward the end of grade school. 
By the time boys are 10, they are telling jokes that are very physically 
violent and very sexual. Girls that age like humor that is verbally aggressive, 
perhaps because they often have better verbal skills than boys. They may tease 
each other about boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
While the kids' jokes may seem quite different to their parents and teachers, 
boys and girls use humor to do the same things. When an 11-year-old boy 
snickers at a joke about rape or prostitution, he's not making a judgment about 
those topics. Sexual issues are much too stressful for him to deal with 
directly. "The child uses the joke to check out what feelings and behaviors are 
acceptable," says Kutner. "He can try out a position and, if necessary, back 
away fast." 
</P>
<P>
Jokes can serve another purpose at this age as well. They can be like team 
sweat shirts, letting the other children know who belongs and who doesn't. 
Those who "get" a particular joke are in the group; those who don't aren't.

MIXING THE OLD WITH THE NEW;

<P>
CULTURE: AT THE BELLWOOD HEALTH CENTER IN BELLFLOWER, IGNACIO AGUILAR COMBINES 
OLD WORLD METHODS WITH MORE TRADITIONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY TO HEAL HIS LATINO 
PATIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To many of his patients and colleagues, Ignacio Aguilar, 63, is known as a 
licensed clinical social worker with 18 years of experience. He has a framed 
master's degree from USC to prove it. But to others who seek him out, Aguilar 
is known as "the witch doctor." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my own colleagues call me the witch doctor. It doesn't really bother 
me," he says, referring to his status in the Latino and mental-health 
communities as a curandero, or folk healer. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar is the clinical coordinator of Amanecer, an in-patient psychiatric 
program for Latinos at the Bellwood Health Center in Bellflower, where he 
incorporates mainstream psychotherapy with religious and folkloric practices. 
Frequently Aguilar is asked to present his unique technique at universities and 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar honed his skills by observing other curanderos while they performed 
limpias (spiritual cleansings), which involve incense and candle burning, 
praying, chanting and touching heads -- elements that help him make "a cultural 
connection with patients." 
</P>
<P>
He began incorporating "mystical, Old World" methods into his treatment regimen 
19 years ago when he realized patients didn't always respond to traditional 
therapy, he recalls. At the time, Aguilar, a Mexico City native, was working at 
Metropolitan State Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
"There were very few Spanish-speaking psychotherapists. It was then I realized 
that patients were seeing curanderos and going to botanicas," he says. At 
first, Aguilar would sneak curanderos into the hospital to assist in a 
patient's treatment. Later, he began a treatment program exclusively for 
Latinos, and eventually the hospital allowed him to blend his Latino customs 
with modern medicine. 
</P>
<P>
He left Metropolitan last year after a new administration "didn't support my 
techniques," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Silva, executive director of Metropolitan, acknowledges that Aguilar "was 
instrumental in the hospital's Latino program, in developing it and in 
nurturing it, but we wanted to change the direction of the program." 
</P>
<P>
"For many years we focused on patients particularly from rural Mexico and rural 
Central America, and now we want to get patients in the local Hispanic 
community," Silva says. "I'm not criticizing one type of treatment over 
another, but matters such as a limpia haven't come up as an issue." 
</P>
<P>
At his new post, Aguilar is once again mixing the old with the new. 
</P>
<P>
And he has the support of Bellwood's administration, including Elvia Correa, 
Amanecer's program director. Correa, also a licensed clinical social worker 
with a masters in social work from USC, leads therapy groups in Spanish with 
Aguilar. "I am not a curandera," she says. "I am Mexican. I understand the 
culture, the language, but I am not skilled as a curandera. I observe." 
</P>
<P>
Correa says Bellwood recently began advertising limpias in Spanish-language 
newspapers as a way of reaching out to those in the Latino community who 
observe such customs and rituals. Limpias are charged on a sliding-fee scale 
and usually average $30. 
</P>
<P>
Explains Aguilar: "My concept of medicine is this: There is a road to health 
that a patient has to travel in order to get well. And when it comes to the 
Hispanic patient, they already have their own perception of illness. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Mexican culture, there is no such thing as mental health. Your are 
crazy or you are not. Any time there is an unusual behavior, that behavior is 
attached to an external force -- bewitchment, something that is out of their 
control -- which is why the limpias, the herbs and the amulets are so important 
in the healing process." 
</P>
<P>
Often, Aguilar performs limpias -- individual and group -- at Bellwood Health 
Center when he and the patient agree it can be a benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, such a limpia involved sweeping a patient's body with branches from a 
pepper tree (believed to be the tree from which Christ's cross was fashioned) 
while incense and candles burned in the dark room. The patient's family stood 
nearby praying, asking God to help their loved one, who believed he was 
possessed by evil spirits. Then Aguilar waved a ceramic pot with incense over 
the man's body "to draw all the bad things clinging to the patient." 
</P>
<P>
"The patient then usually goes into a trance," he explains. It is at this stage 
of the limpia that Aguilar says he "manipulates the patient by praying and 
touching the head and sweeping the branches. The patient actually feels that 
something is happening, and of course, that is the effect you want. At the end 
you cleanse the patient with holy water and a blessing, and the patient feels 
protected and rid of whatever evil he felt was clinging onto his body." 
</P>
<P>
The treatment for this patient also involved traditional therapy sessions and 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideal thing to happen," says Aguilar, "is for health care professionals 
and psychotherapists to make a cultural connection because then that patient is 
going to trust us and hopefully will be willing to accept orthodox treatment, 
medication and psychotherapy along with their Old World practices."

THE 1940S: A TRAVELING EXHIBIT OF MINIATURE MANNEQUINS SHOWS OFF STYLES OF 
POSTWAR PARIS.

Fashion history buffs have been fascinated by "Theatre de la Mode," an 
exhibition that opened last spring at the Louvre in Paris, moved to the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art here this month and will tour the United States 
(cities undetermined) and Japan next spring. 
</P>
<P>
A display of 150 vintage miniature mannequins dressed in couture creations from 
the mid-40s, the show reveals some surprising trivia: The Nazis understood the 
economic importance of fashion and the role of style in French culture. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they almost transferred the entire French industry to Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
But they didn't. And in the spring of 1945, after the liberation of Paris, the 
couturiers began to rebuild their industry. Materials were so scarce, however, 
that they had to show their styles on 27-inch wire figurines. 
</P>
<P>
In 1945 and 1946, more than 200 of these dolls, clothed by Balenciaga, Lanvin, 
Balmain and Worth, among others, were arranged on miniature stages designed by 
France's artists and set designers. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, sponsored by the Chambre Syndicale, the couturier trade 
organization, was named "Theatre de la Mode" and dispatched to the major 
European cities, as well as to New York and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"After the war, everybody wanted the idea of dream, opulence, femininity, and 
fantasy," said Costume Institute associate curator Katell le Bourhis, who 
organized the New York exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
After the final stop of the 1946 tour in San Francisco, the mannequins were 
donated to the Maryhill Museum in Goldendale, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the figurines came to the attention of Stanley Garfinkle, a 
historian preparing a documentary on Christian Dior. "The French had completely 
forgotten about them," Garfinkle said. 
</P>
<P>
The dolls were sent back to Paris to be restored, and the "Theatre de la Mode" 
was re-created. It will eventually return to Maryhill Museum. DAVID D'ARCY

THIS SET OF SANTA'S ELVES IS BETTER SCHOOLED; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: TO HELP MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR TALENT IN THE TOY INDUSTRY, A 
LEADING DESIGN SCHOOL HAS ADDED A DEGREE PROGRAM IN TOY-MAKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Some children may still think elves are behind the production of Christmas 
toys. But today's toy-maker is more likely to be hunched over a drafting table 
instead of a work bench, and equipped with an education that includes knowledge 
in subjects ranging from computer-aided design to psychology. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. toy manufacturing business is not child's play: It employs about 
50,000 people at more than 250 companies nationwide. Between 5,000 and 6,000 
new toy products are expected to crowd the shelves this year, competing with 
more than 150,000 different kinds of toys for a piece of the industry's $12.5 
billion in annual retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
More and more, toy companies need designers who can create toys spanning that 
market, from "hot" items like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to classics -- like 
Yo-Yos and Legos -- that find new buyers with each generation. 
</P>
<P>
To meet this need, the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, one of the 
country's largest design schools, has added a new degree program in toy design. 
The program's two-year curriculum shows that making toys has come a long way 
from Santa's workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Students are required to have at least an associate-level degree in art or 
design to apply. Once accepted, they must develop rendering skills for 
three-dimensional toys, study materials and methods used to manufacture both 
plastic and non-plastic toys, master safety regulations, and understand 
advertising, promotion and other aspects of the business. 
</P>
<P>
Department chairwoman Judy Ellis said the school's requirements reflect the 
demands and responsibilities toy designers face. 
</P>
<P>
"As an educational institution, we are preparing students to be hired as 
designers, but we also are hoping that our students will be able to make some 
changes -- changes in what parents expect from toys, changes in the types of 
toys being produced," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
She said there are no definitive trends in the toy industry, except that some 
toys appear to have eternal appeal -- girls, for example, will always want to 
play with dolls, she said -- and the popularity of electronic toys seems to be 
fading. 
</P>
<P>
"They are extremely expensive," she said. "The talking bears and the talking 
dolls and all that -- they have a price point that many parents can't reach. 
There is also a question of how much play value these kinds of toys have. 
</P>
<P>
"You want children to interact with their toys, to use their imaginations," she 
said. "If the toy does all the work for them, (the children) are not going to 
interact." 
</P>
<P>
Although Ellis said no particular design philosophy is pushed on students, her 
personal belief is that "less is more." 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a concept that is really excellent and understand what play is 
about, you don't need to jazz it up, unless it's an addition to some basic 
concept, like new clothes for a Barbie doll," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although reluctant to attack directly the often crass commercialization of toys 
-- with movies and television cartoons produced for the sole purpose of selling 
items -- Ellis said the school tries to keep students focused on the creative 
aspects of toy-making. 
</P>
<P>
"We want them to see that there is something to creating toys that are not 
dependent on commercials, toys that children can play with for extended periods 
of time without becoming bored," she said. "A toy should have a life. It 
shouldn't be played with for five minutes and then forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the school also recognizes it has "to be responsible with our students," 
Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Since advertising is part of the industry, we have a course in advertising and 
promotion. But we also bring consumer groups in to speak. We expose them to the 
realities of life," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are really trying to do is to understand what is both wanted and 
needed. The toy industry is really market driven, so it is important not only 
to provide what is wanted, but what is needed."

EASING THE EFFECTS OF HOLIDAY STRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE FASBINDER, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holiday stress is a well-known phenomenon that gets a great deal of attention 
every year. Most health experts concede that for some individuals, the holidays 
are a difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
Simon Keochakian, a counselor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 
says that even families can be victims of the winter holiday stress, warning 
that they "can be a family's most difficult time." 
</P>
<P>
Just as with individuals, families are expected to look forward to Christmas 
with cheer and warm feelings. But somewhere along the line, someone's feelings 
can get stepped on. 
</P>
<P>
Keochakian says unrealistic expectations are a big part of the problem. "By 
building up the holidays to be more than they are, we set ourselves up for 
disappointment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are ways for families to cope with holiday stress, said Keochakian, the 
associate director for clinical services at the college's Center for Counseling 
and Academic Development. 
</P>
<P>
Any pre-existing family problems tend to get aggravated by the hustle and 
bustle that accompanies holiday shopping and family gatherings, said 
Keochakian, so it's a good idea to keep an eye out for this kind of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of trouble can be avoided if you simply plan ahead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
College students may have special problems. In school, they learn to become 
independent, making their own decisions about relationships and careers. 
Keochakian calls them "emerging adults." 
</P>
<P>
When they come home for the holidays, "They tend to fall into the old roles," 
he said. "Mom does the laundry and they are expected to follow rules laid down 
by parents." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict can lead to confusion, and the anger gets passed back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides need to make adjustments and should be ready to make concessions, 
Keochakian said. Parents should encourage children to be independent and "at 
least entertain the possibility that what their child is saying or doing is 
valid." 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, "emerging adults" must recognize that they have responsibilities, 
too. "There is a certain sanctity of the home," said Keochakian. "There are 
certain guidelines and responsibilities for each person who lives there. 
</P>
<P>
"College students have to recognize that they are no longer integral, everyday 
parts of the family. They're visitors, now. 
</P>
<P>
"Visiting in-laws can bring its own set of problems. For example, take the 
situation of a married couple visiting the husband's mother. 
</P>
<P>
"Within minutes, the wife gets to see her husband change from a confident, 
assertive, successful spouse into a submissive child," Keochakian said. "This 
can be terribly disconcerting to the wife. Your spouse has changed into someone 
you don't even know." 
</P>
<P>
One way of avoiding potential trouble is to prearrange an escape signal, he 
said. For example, tugging on an earlobe could be a sign that a blowup is near 
and it's time to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the situation, Keochakian said it's essential to have the groundwork 
beforehand. "Imagine a worst-case scenario and make arrangements for dealing 
with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a family member tends to drink and become obstreperous by the end of the 
day, make plans in advance to visit a friend or to take a walk." 
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned that the holidays are not the time to drop a bombshell on the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
College students should not "go home and tell your parents that you've decided 
to quit school or that you're not going to be a doctor after all. Pick a 
less-charged time to announce dramatic changes in your life plans." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, Keochakian said, children and parents may have irreconcilable 
differences. If so, they should recognize that the time they spend together 
will be tolerable, at best. 
</P>
<P>
"Learn to recognize that compromises are essential to happy relationships," he 
said. "Let go of rigid positions. Remember that nothing is ever perfect."

SOUTH-CENTRAL CHALLENGE; 
</P>
<P>
YOUTH: THE CHALLENGERS CLUB BEGAN AS ONE MAN'S STRUGGLE FOR THE HEARTS AND 
MINDS OF KIDS IN SOUTH-CENTRAL L.A. IT'S NOW A BONA-FIDE PROGRAM FOR GANG 
PREVENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL MANNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago, when Inaliel Lisbey was in the third grade, he was in constant 
trouble for fighting and vandalizing at his South-Central Los Angeles 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Then he stopped going to class altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"He was leaving the school with gang members as soon as I dropped him off," 
said his mother, Leilani Pettiford, a single parent with three other young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to control her son and desperate for help, Pettiford called the police, 
asking that Inaliel be placed in a juvenile hall. 
</P>
<P>
The police said that wasn't possible since the boy hadn't been arrested. Rather 
than wait for that to happen, they referred her to the Challengers Boys and 
Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
Over 22 years, the Challengers Club has established a reputation among 
South-Central law enforcement, social service and school officials for keeping 
youths off the streets and out of trouble through a comprehensive program of 
education, recreation and family support services. 
</P>
<P>
"Challengers is designed for the kid not yet into trouble or just on the 
verge," said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Mike Downing, whose 77th Division includes 
the Challengers' neighborhood. "The club kind of sways them over to the 
positive side." 
</P>
<P>
For Pettiford and her son, the club was a life raft. Inaliel became a 
Challenger and took the first step toward turning his young life around. 
</P>
<P>
Located on the corner of 51st Street and Vermont Avenue, the Challengers' blue 
and white clubhouse stands pristine amid the broken down storefronts that 
surround it, many tattooed with the graffiti of the local gang, the Five Deuce 
Hoover Crips. 
</P>
<P>
"We are surrounded," said Lou Dantzler, the Challengers' 53-year-old executive 
director and founder, referring to the gangs. "But in all the time we've been 
here, we've never had any gang incident. 
</P>
<P>
"We have kids who may have belonged to a gang at one time, but when they come 
here, those things are stopped at the gate." 
</P>
<P>
About 200 children come to Challengers each day, many picked up from their 
schools or homes by club-operated buses. All are between the ages of 6 and 17. 
About 90% are black. 
</P>
<P>
From the time they sign in until checkout time at 7 p.m., club members are 
closely supervised by Challengers staff and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have homework are sent to the library. Only after their work has been 
completed and checked will they be released to the other activity areas. 
</P>
<P>
Many head for the arts and crafts room. Others go to the club's computer 
center, where the eight IBM terminals are in near-constant use. Each computer 
is fitted with learning programs aimed at improving math, reading and science 
skills at various grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
For members who need one-on-one help with their schoolwork, club members' 
parents conduct tutoring sessions each Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Challengers operates on an annual budget of about $600,000 and receives funding 
from a variety of sources including the Brotherhood Crusade, United Way, the 
city of Los Angeles, private foundations and local corporations and 
individuals, Dantzler said. 
</P>
<P>
The annual membership fee of $15 per child is considered a bargain by most 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"This right here is the perfect environment," said Leilani Pettiford during a 
recent visit to the club. Pettiford said Inaliel's behavior and truancy 
problems ceased soon after he joined Challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Pettiford credits the club's tutorial program for improving Inaliel's school 
performance. "From the program here, he was put in a magnet school for gifted 
kids," she said, adding that she has since enrolled her three other children at 
Challengers. 
</P>
<P>
In the 22 years since its inception, more than 25,000 South-Central youths have 
belonged to Challengers, according to club statistics. The club recently 
boosted its full-time staff from nine to 15, adding, among others, a nurse who 
screens members for health and dental problems. 
</P>
<P>
By Dantzler's design, Challengers also relies heavily on parent volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't have nearly as many problems if parents were more involved in the 
lives of their kids," Dantzler said. 
</P>
<P>
To promote interaction and communication between club members and their 
parents, Dantzler requires parents to donate two hours of volunteer work at the 
club each week. 
</P>
<P>
Dantzler also puts 75 to 80 teen-aged club members to work each summer as 
junior staff, part of his gang prevention strategy. Their duties include 
supervising younger members, administrative work and picking up. Junior staff 
are paid $4.25 an hour through the city's Summer Youth Employment Program. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Dantzler's struggle for the hearts and minds of South-Central children 
began three years after the Watts riots. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest of 17 children born to South Carolina sharecroppers, Dantzler 
moved to Los Angeles in the early '60s, while serving with the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
After his discharge, he married, fathered two sons and was working as a public 
school janitor when he took the first steps in forming what would become the 
Challengers Club. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no master plan," Dantzler recalled recently. "I'd just bought a new 
pickup truck and kids liked to ride in the back." 
</P>
<P>
Dantzler saw that many of the boys in his neighborhood had no fathers living 
with them and nothing to do on weekends, so he started driving the children to 
the park on Saturdays to play ball. 
</P>
<P>
As more and more boys showed up, Dantzler enlisted the help of neighborhood 
parents. Soon, the weekend trips involved dozens of youths and a caravan of 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
Dantzler had tapped a vein of need in his community and the club's membership 
snowballed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Vons donated an abandoned 22,000-square-foot supermarket to serve as a 
clubhouse. The building was renovated with help from foundation grants and 
volunteer labor. The club opened its doors to girls in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
One of Challengers' earliest members was Carl Reed, who is now the director of 
operations and Dantzler's right hand man. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Reed was a 15-year-old gang member and drug seller. He joined the 
newly opened Challengers' Club because it had the only basketball courts in the 
area. But he soon found out that to enjoy the club, he had to follow Dantzler's 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't used to being bossed around or given instructions," recalled Reed. 
His violent temper resulted in repeated suspensions from the club for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
But Dantzler saw potential in Reed and gave him a chance to prove himself. "He 
gave me a job after all that I did," Reed said. "I felt like I owed it to him 
to do right." 
</P>
<P>
As a junior staff member, Reed learned to show up on time and handle 
responsibility. "Lou taught me discipline and how to listen to other people," 
said Reed. "He basically taught me how to be a man." 
</P>
<P>
Reed quit his gang, finished high school and spent three years at Chico State 
College. After a stint in the Air Force, he returned to the neighborhood with 
his wife and two sons. Intent on giving something back, Reed began working with 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
Reed noted that in his youth, gang violence rarely went beyond fist-fighting, 
but today automatic weapons are standard gang equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"The disease is getting worse," Reed said. "But the club is the cure." 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that makes Challengers unique is the people involved," according to 
Gloria Clark, a director of the city's Community Development Department, which 
funds a number of youth development programs including one at Challengers 
designed to attract high-risk children to the club. 
</P>
<P>
"Lou Dantzler is a committed, loving mentor to those kids," Clark continued. 
"He has the ability to bring out the positive in them." 
</P>
<P>
In the words of Sgt. Downing: "Lou will hug the kid with one hand and 
discipline him with the other." 
</P>
<P>
Club members who have excelled at school or in club athletic competitions are 
publicly praised and recognized with awards. 
</P>
<P>
Gum-chewing, swearing and fighting are prohibited, as are hats, khaki pants and 
red or blue shoe strings -- attire associated with gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Members are told that if they break the rules or step out of line either at 
school or at home, they may be subject to "swats" -- public spankings with 
paddle. Upon enrolling their children at Challengers, all parents must sign a 
release permitting Dantzler to administer swats. 
</P>
<P>
Marcy Frerichs, a counselor at Norwood Street Elementary School who referred 
about 30 children to Challengers last year and is a staunch club supporter, 
says she is uneasy about the practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a concern we have because we're referring the children out of the 
school," she said. "Our position is: If there are options other than the swats, 
we encourage them." 
</P>
<P>
Dantzler acknowledged the delicacy of the matter: "It's a very touchy subject 
and that's why we don't let anyone come in here without them being aware of 
what we're doing and who does it." 
</P>
<P>
Dantzler is considered a positive role model by many club parents and a 
confidant by club members. The same is true for director of operations, Reed. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a single parent, I especially like that my son has good role models in 
Lou and Carl," said Mildred Parker, the mother of 12-year-old Brandon. "It's 
good for him to have a man to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
For Parker, the club has become much more than a place for her son to spend 
time after school. "It's like having an extension of a family that I don't 
really have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker added that, in addition to helping her son improve his grades, 
Challengers has given him a sense of pride and place to belong. 
</P>
<P>
"The club teaches self-respect and self-esteem," Parker said. "They teach kids, 
'It's OK that you're right here in South Central. You can come to the club and 
be a part of something that's positive where people care about you. You don't 
have to go out and create a little clique you call a family.' " 
</P>
<P>
Challengers has had some failures, and in the gang milieu, failure is 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Among the inspirational banners hanging on the gymnasium wall is one that 
reads: "Eddie we love you. Our prayers are with you." 
</P>
<P>
Late on the night of July 20, 15-year-old club member Eddie Chillies was shot 
in the back of the head in a drive-by shooting three blocks from the club. 
</P>
<P>
According to Eddie's uncle, Level Henderson, Eddie was wearing a black Houston 
Oilers cap, part of the uniform of the Five Deuce Hoover Crips. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Eddie's claim that he had initially broken away from the Crips after 
joining Challengers, but he had recently slipped back into gangbanging. 
</P>
<P>
Now Eddie spends his days in a wheelchair, a piece of bullet so deep in his 
brain that doctors are unable to remove it safely. He undergoes six hours of 
therapy five days a week to re-learn how to speak and walk. Although doctors 
say Eddie is improving markedly, chances for full recovery are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie had been admitted into the Whittier Family Foundations' "I Have a Dream" 
program, administered from the club, ensuring him funds to go to college. 
Today, Eddie's chances of realizing that dream are diminished. 
</P>
<P>
One of Eddie's closest friends is 16-year-old Challengers member Devon Logan, 
also in the "Dream" program. Logan said that what happened to Eddie has made 
him all the more determined to stay out of gangs himself. 
</P>
<P>
Since his friend's shooting, Logan said he spends every Tuesday and Thursday 
afternoon at the Challengers' computer center, using learning programs to 
improve his math and English skills in preparation for college. 
</P>
<P>
"I can go to any college I want to," Logan said. "I'm going to stay out of 
trouble and do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Dantzler recently started construction on a lot next to the Challengers 
clubhouse where he intends to build a larger facility with classrooms, tennis 
courts, a swimming pool, a senior citizens lounge and a day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
The project will cost an estimated $5.2 million to be raised from club members, 
foundations, public grants, individuals and corporate donors. Dantzler said he 
has secured almost $3 million toward his goal. 
</P>
<P>
"People must think I'm crazy," Dantzler said, as he examined blueprints for the 
new building. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I wonder myself how I got into this." 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, he answers his question: "It's because there's a need."

A BROADWAY GOODBY TO BERNSTEIN; 
</P>
<P>
MEMORIAL: LONGTIME FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES LAUGH, CRY, SING AT NEW YORK'S 
MAJESTIC THEATER.

<P>
Laughter and tears flowed freely as the Broadway theatrical community said 
goodby Thursday to Leonard Bernstein at the Majestic Theater. Longtime friends 
and colleagues -- those who knew him as Lenny -- paid tribute to the 
musical-theater dynamo with heartfelt and humorous words, and often in song. 
</P>
<P>
The capacity audience -- invited friends, relatives and theatrical 
personalities as well as 850 members of the public who started lining up at 7 
a.m. -- heard recollections of an energetic Bernstein who danced until dawn in 
discos as well as a poignant account of his final days. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book for "West Side Story," hosted the 75-minute 
tribute to Bernstein, 72, who died Oct. 14. "Wherever Lenny was, was theater; 
his every move was a stage direction," he said, as many in the audience laughed 
knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
Another "West Side Story" collaborator, director-choreographer Jerome Robbins, 
had earned a laugh before he even spoke, thanks to Laurents' introductory 
words: "Fearless as Lenny was, there were two figures he did fear -- God and 
Jerome Robbins." 
</P>
<P>
After noting that he wished he were young enough to pay homage to Bernstein by 
performing the sailor's variation he created in the ballet "Fancy Free," 
Robbins, 72, recalled that halcyon 1944 collaboration between the two 
25-year-olds. He also reflected on the joyous nature of their 1957 "West Side 
Story" collaboration, even while the show faced repeated obstacles before 
reaching Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"Lenny's music was the lifeblood of that show. His theater scores weren't just 
a collection of songs but were more like a symphonic work," noted Robbins, who 
also collaborated on several other ballet and theater works with Bernstein. He 
concluded in subdued tones, "We have lost a maker and shaker of our century. A 
light went out for me." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Lawrence, the original Maria of "West Side Story," sang a medley of "I 
Feel Pretty" and "Tonight." The "West Side Story" reunion was not as complete 
as had been scheduled; Larry Kert was unable to be there, and Stephen Sondheim 
(who, then a newcomer to Broadway, wrote the lyrics) could not attend due to 
illness in his family. 
</P>
<P>
Original cast members from Bernstein shows sang numbers they had helped launch 
into history. Nancy Walker sang her sassy "I Can Cook Too" from "On the Town." 
Her fellow cast members, Betty Comden and Adolph Green (who also teamed with 
Bernstein as the show's creators), after fondly recalling their 50-year 
friendship with Bernstein, poignantly sang the show's bittersweet finale, "Some 
Other Time." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Cook, the original Cunegonde in Bernstein's "Candide" (1956), displayed 
her still-gleaming voice in "A Simple Song" from Bernstein's 1971 "Mass." 
"Candide" itself was represented by "Glitter and Be Gay," the coloratura aria 
Cook made famous, as performed by Constance Haumann. 
</P>
<P>
Winging in from the West Coast (as was Walker) was Lauren Bacall, who teamed up 
with Phyllis Newman for a sly rendition of "Ohio" from Bernstein's "Wonderful 
Town." Kurt Ollmann, familiar from Bernstein's 1985 "West Side Story" 
recording, sang "Take Care of This House" from Bernstein's last (1976), 
unsuccessful, Broadway show, "1600 Pennsylvania Ave." -- a work the composer 
often spoke of wanting to revise. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein's son, Alexander, delivered a funny, knowing, affectionate talk about 
his father's unappreciated skills as an actor, singer and dancer as only a 
family member could know them. Michael Wager, a very close friend of 
Bernstein's who was with him at the end, spoke movingly of how difficult it was 
for Bernstein to continue when illness had robbed him of his creative energy. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Horne closed the program with "Somewhere," the emotional anthem from 
"West Side Story," after which Laurents directed the audience's attention to 
the large photo that hung over the stage: an exuberant 39-year-old Bernstein, 
nearly levitating outside the theater where "West Side Story" had opened in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Since "Lenny didn't like silence," Laurents asked instead for a final round of 
applause for the man who inspired and moved so many people for so many years. 
The audience responded with a sustained standing ovation.

MARTHA WASH GETS HER FORM BACK; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: THE SINGER'S VOICE BUT NOT FACE APPEARED ON THE BLACK BOX VIDEOS. 
BUT SHE'LL PERFORM TONIGHT AT DETAILS.

When the act billed as Black Box takes the stage at Details dance club in 
downtown Los Angeles tonight, fans expecting the slim model who appeared to be 
singing hit songs in the videos and in concerts by the group will be surprised, 
to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
The voice will be the same as the voice on Black Box's "Everybody Everybody" 
and "I Don't Know Anybody Else," and the backing tracks will be the same. But 
the face and form seen by the audience will belong to Martha Wash, a woman who 
once sang in a duo called Two Tons o' Fun. 
</P>
<P>
Oh -- and there's another difference between Wash's show and the ones put on by 
Katrin Quinol for Black Box: Wash will not be lip-syncing. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco native, who gained cult status in the gay disco scene in the 
early 1980s as part of the Weather Girls with the song "It's Raining Men," was 
thrust into the glare of mainstream media attention last month when the Milli 
Vanilli scandal sent reporters scurrying for examples of artists whose voices 
had been appropriated by producers and lip-syncing models. 
</P>
<P>
Wash, who at the time was in the process of suing three record labels for 
allegedly distributing albums and music videos that featured her voice while 
crediting other women as the singers, seemed to be made-to-order. In addition 
to Black Box distributor RCA, she was suing the group Seduction's record label 
A&amp;M, and Columbia Records, for whom the producers of Seduction had made 
records under the name C&amp;C Music Factory. 
</P>
<P>
Wash was the singer on C&amp;C Music Factory's hit "Gonna Make You Sweat" and 
Seduction's "You're My One and Only True Love." But it was a Black Box concert 
that really got to her. 
</P>
<P>
"When Black Box was in New York, I saw their show, and she was standing up 
there lip-syncing to my music," the soft-spoken singer said this week, 
referring to the group's on-stage front woman Quinol. 
</P>
<P>
"The patrons at the club were quite upset because they knew my voice -- I had 
performed at that club many times before," Wash said by telephone from New 
York. "Some of them kind of walked away from the stage area, and there were 
people trying to talk to me, saying, 'I'd recognize your voice anywhere. How 
could she get up there and do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Thanks in part to the publicity, Wash's troubles seem to be heading toward a 
resolution. She has signed an eight-year, eight-album contract with RCA and is 
in settlement talks with A&amp;M. Her suit against Columbia was filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles on the second stop of an eight-city tour -- on which many club 
owners have billed the performer as Black Box, with Wash's name in small print 
on the tickets and advertisements -- Wash plans to limit her performance to 
songs by Black Box, Seduction and C&amp;C Music Factory. The idea is to 
establish herself as the singer to the dance-club audience that made the songs 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
Then, she figures, she will have an audience on which to try new music and old 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
For someone who feels thrice betrayed by the music industry, Wash displays an 
optimism toward her profession that might seem unusual under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I do for my living, just like anybody else who has a job," said 
Wash, who according to family stories has been singing since she was 2. "In any 
other job or occupation you have to be careful, or you get swallowed up. 
(Music) is just like any other business. It just happens to be a 
billion-and-billion-and-billion-dollar business."

SAXOPHONISTS TO GATHER FOR CHRISTMAS BLOWOUT; 
</P>
<P>
REEDS: THE INSTRUMENT IS STILL TRYING TO FIND RESPECT IN CLASSICAL CIRCLES. IN 
THE MEANTIME, MORE THAN 100 SAXES WILL RAISE THEIR VOICES AT KNOTT'S BERRY 
FARM.

It was 150 years ago when musical instrument innovator Adolphe Sax introduced 
the saxophone, an event that was greeted with vicious press attacks, a 
suspicious fire at Sax's factory, a flurry of litigation and physical attacks 
upon Sax's person. The resistence that Sax and his namesake instrument met from 
the more staid instrument-makers of his day seems to have hung on in classical 
circles. Whatever inroads the sax may have made in popular and martial music, 
it remains an orphan child in the orchestral world, only rarely featured on the 
symphonic stage. 
</P>
<P>
So, no, there couldn't possibly be a sense of revenge involved in organizing a 
band of more than 100 saxes, could there? A band with no trumpets, no flutes, 
no nothing but row upon row of gleaming saxophones, saxophones, saxophones! 
</P>
<P>
There may be just a bit of competitive spirit involved, admitted Paul Kardos, 
who originated and leads the 148-reed "Saxophone Christmas," which performs at 
Knott's Berry Farm on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
While the sax ensemble began as a "just a kind of wild idea" that he and a 
student kicked around six years ago, it was also spurred by the existence of a 
"Tuba Christmas" held every year at Los Angeles' Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like a joke -- the tuba is just so limited," Kardos said, "while 
with saxophones you can cover the full range of orchestral sound. So we were 
just sitting around saying, 'Wouldn't it be neat to get 20 or 30 saxophones 
together?' So we sent letters out to high schools and we ended up with 103 
saxes that first year. We were just staggered, and since then it's grown." 
</P>
<P>
Kardos, 43, is professor of music at San Bernardino Valley College, teaches 
saxophone at Cal State San Bernardino and also works as a clinician and solo 
artist, playing everything from swing to rock engagements. 
</P>
<P>
In the past six years his massed saxes have made Yuletide appearances at 
Knott's, Disneyland and the Queen Mary. Two years ago the aggregation grew to 
240 players, with 215 of those turning up for that year's Knott's performance. 
(The park has since suggested that that's a few more saxes than they can 
handle.) 
</P>
<P>
Employing an instrumentation ranging from the rare bass sax to the diminutive 
sopranino sax, the group plays custom-made arrangements of traditional 
Christmas carols and pop themes such as "Jingle Bell Rock." 
</P>
<P>
The participating musicians are drawn from 28 high schools and 12 colleges 
along with a number of adult players. Some have come from Nevada and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Their motivation, Kardos said, is that "a lot of them love to play the 
saxophone and love to perform in public with it. And then to be in a unique, 
one-of-a-kind event like this is thrilling. We have a lot of people returning 
year after year, even people from six years ago are still coming back." 
</P>
<P>
As to his own motivation, Kardos said, "you're talking to a crusader. I have 
been pushing saxophone all my life, ever since I have been playing it. It's not 
from an inferiority complex (about the instrument), it's just trying to get 
acceptance for it. It's been around for a long time. This is the 151st year of 
the saxophone. It's slowly, slowly gaining in orchestral literature, where 
they're writing parts for saxophone. But I'm a working professional, and I've 
only worked with one professional symphony here in 13 years as a saxophone 
artist." 
</P>
<P>
Kardos isn't sitting still while waiting for the classical world to come 
around: "I can't talk about it now, but we may have something really big in the 
works for next year. It would be nationwide." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Saxophone Christmas" will be held Saturday at 5 p.m. in Old West Ghost 
Town, Knott's Berry Farm, 8039 Beach Blvd., Buena Park, as part of the fifth 
annual Ghost Town Christmas Crafts Festival. Admission: $2. Children under 12 
are free. Information: (714) 220-5200.

Anticipating a slowdown in construction, officials of the Foothill Ranch 
planned community development in Saddleback Valley have laid off Maudette M. 
Ball, who was to have administered an ambitious public art program there. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Downey, vice president and project manager of the 2,700-acre development, 
northeast of Lake Forest and El Toro, said the officials have laid off about 10 
employees overall. 
</P>
<P>
Downey said that officials still expect to install about 100 public artworks 
over the projected 15-year development but that the acquisitions probably will 
be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know when the next pieces will be commissioned, but it's likely to be 
further out than we had hoped," Downey said. "Whether that means 90 days or 
nine months, we don't know." However, already commissioned artworks by Eric Orr 
and John Svenson will be completed, Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothill Ranch Urban Arts Program has been praised because it is to be 
funded with fees required by the parent Hon Development Co. of subcontractors 
building homes and other units. Typically, only local governments have imposed 
such fees.

POLY'S PIED PIPER ; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL COACH FRED CUCCIA EFFECTS TURNAROUND WITH PERSUASIVE SALES PITCH, 
COMPASSIONATE TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

It is difficult to miss the biggest symbol of the turnaround in the Poly High 
football program. Eddie Moreno, a 6-foot-2, 260-pound senior tackle, has helped 
improve the Parrots as much as the program has transformed him. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Parrots stumbled to a 1-8-1 record as part of a legacy of 
futility. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Poly has forged a 10-3 record and takes a four-game winning 
streak into the City Section 3-A Division championship game. Poly will play 
Lincoln (9-3-1) at 7:30 tonight at East Los Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
But Poly's turnabout pales in comparison to the transformation of Moreno. Two 
years ago, he was an admitted campus bully who found himself inside a juvenile 
detention center. 
</P>
<P>
He already had been shot three times and figured more bullets were headed his 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's an All-East Valley League selection and so popular on campus that the 
student body voted him homecoming king last month. 
</P>
<P>
Moreno says it's easy to explain his new life style. Like many at the Sun 
Valley school, he's become a member of the Fred Cuccia fan club. Cuccia, 45, 
has worked his rebuilding magic at his third high school in the past decade as 
the second-year Poly football coach and has enjoyed the Parrots' resurgence so 
much he might even stick around for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"They like me and I like them," Cuccia said of the players. "It's like a family 
and I'm the big daddy -- I'm the old man. They know I care about them. I chew 
their butts out and I holler at them, but we always try to do everything in a 
positive manner." 
</P>
<P>
The recruitment of Moreno attests to the Cuccia method. He spotted Moreno on 
campus and asked him to try out for the football team. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time anybody ever asked me to do something," Moreno said. 
"Usually everyone is always telling me what to do." 
</P>
<P>
He soon joined the team even though he was a stranger to football. He tried out 
at linebacker but soon moved to the offensive line where he has emerged as one 
of the area's top players. 
</P>
<P>
Moreno is just one of the positive stories associated with the team. Glance 
down the roster and more abound, even among the assistant coaches. Bob Mesa, 
who works with the offensive line, graduated from Poly in 1975. He has been an 
assistant for 12 seasons under four different head coaches. No coach has taught 
him more than he's learned under Cuccia. 
</P>
<P>
"The way this program is run now, it's like night and day," Mesa said. 
"(Cuccia) has brought back pride. I finally know what a program is. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned more in the last two years with him than I've learned maybe in 
the last six, seven years. I remember going home and calling my father on the 
phone and saying, 'You know what, dad? We got a program at Poly High." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Senegal, who coaches the running backs and graduated from Poly in 1987, 
echoes Mesa's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could have played for him, I'd probably be in college (playing) somewhere 
right now," Senegal said. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia has always loved a good challenge but the Poly program gave new meaning 
to the word. He was hired just days before practice started in 1989, inheriting 
a team that had won just four games the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Poly did not have a strong football tradition, qualifying for the 
playoffs just five times in 33 years and advancing to the championship game 
just once. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I like the challenge . . . the challenge of building a program where 
no one thinks it can be good," Cuccia said. 
</P>
<P>
He's been there before. He turned around programs at Hoover and South Pasadena 
in the 1980s, but moved on once the task was complete. 
</P>
<P>
At Hoover, he took over a team that scored just seven points in league play in 
1982. Three years later, the Tornadoes posted an 8-2 record and were ranked 
second in the Coastal Conference at the end of the regular season. They were 
bumped from the playoffs after they were forced to forfeit games for use of an 
ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
South Pasadena came calling after the 1985 season. He inherited a team that had 
won just one of 19 games in two previous years and led the Tigers to a 7-2-1 
record in his second season. Cuccia was unhappy with the administration at 
South Pasadena and when the athletic director at California High in Northern 
California called to offer him a job, he and his family packed their bags. 
</P>
<P>
But after his first football season at California, Cuccia and his wife Carol 
decided to return to Southern California for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a friend of Cuccia's wife who had coached at Poly, word reached Poly 
Athletic Director George Tideback that Cuccia was available. Tideback, 61, was 
desperate to replace Kevin Kennedy, who resigned as coach four days before the 
start of practice in '89. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best thing that ever happened to Poly," Tideback said. "Somebody up 
there in the big sky was looking down on us when he came to Poly." 
</P>
<P>
Tideback claims the phone hasn't stopped ringing during Poly's run through the 
playoffs as alumni and members of the community call with congratulations for 
the Parrots and their coach. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia squirms when asked about the accolades, deflecting credit to the 
players. He claims his formula for success is simple: provide an atmosphere of 
mutual respect and let the players have fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I just gave them the opportunity to be successful and they took advantage of 
it," he said. "My job is to make sure they have the best coaches to coach them 
and to get them prepared to play the best game they can possibly play. And if I 
don't do that, I've failed." 
</P>
<P>
The reason Poly hadn't been a winner in recent years was simple, Cuccia said. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't know how to win. They didn't know how to practice. You can 
practice to practice, or you can practice to win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Poly finished 1-8-1 in Cuccia's first year and some people were skeptical. But 
those close to the program knew that there was something different about this 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something about the guy," Tideback said. "You can see it in the kids. 
The guy is just a winner." 
</P>
<P>
After the first season, Cuccia really went to work. He ordered new uniforms and 
changed the colors from royal blue and yellow to Air Force-blue and Notre 
Dame-gold. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted different uniforms for a different attitude," Cuccia explained. "I 
wanted something that told the kids we were going to be a different team 
overall." 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia also implemented a year-round weight program, a spring and summer 
conditioning regimen, and a mandatory study hall. He brought in defensive 
coordinator Hank Swanson to complement assistant coaches Mesa and Senegal. 
</P>
<P>
Having upgraded the coaching staff, he then turned his attention to the 
players. He knew he needed better ones and his search brought him to the 
baseball diamond. Poly has been a traditional City power under Coach Jerry 
Cord. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia actively pursued the baseball players and attended nearly every Poly 
home game. He then enlisted the help of such two-sport players as Jonathan 
Campbell, a running back and defensive back, and wide receiver Marlon McKinney, 
who pitched the football program to their baseball teammates. 
</P>
<P>
The formula worked: Eight baseball players will suit up tonight for the City 
championship game. Catcher Steve Chavez, first-baseman Francisco Flores and 
utility-player Raul Torres have made the most dramatic impacts on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, a senior and second-team All-Valley defensive back, leads the area with 
nine interceptions and has become a genuine college prospect after just one 
season of football. Flores is a 6-4, 235-pound offensive lineman who earned 
All-East Valley League recognition this year as a junior and projects as one of 
the top college prospects in the area for next season. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, a starting linebacker, was a hard sell. His family and baseball 
teammates objected to his interest in football, but Cuccia's sales pitch was 
more persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
"He builds something inside you. He builds character," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
Cord has been forced to start his winter-league baseball season without some of 
his best players. Still, he remains a Poly football fan. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has ever gone after them," Cord said of his players. "In the last six 
or seven years, no one has been a motivator around here to go get kids. Fred is 
the first one in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The numbers bear that out. The turnout for football nearly doubled from 57 to 
107 between his first and second season. 
</P>
<P>
Once recruited, players become loyal because of Cuccia's sense of fairness and 
compassion. Moreno, a burly player with a quick wit and a short temper, again 
is a prime example. 
</P>
<P>
In a game early last season, Moreno grew frustrated by an overly aggressive 
opponent and showed his anger by twisting the player's helmet off and hitting 
him over the head with it. 
</P>
<P>
Moreno was thrown out of the game, but thought he'd suffer a bigger punishment 
from Cuccia. His reception on the sideline caught him by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"He hugged me and said, 'It's all right,' and then he sat me down and that was 
it," Moreno recalled. "I mean, he hugged me. It was the first time a guy ever 
hugged me." 
</P>
<P>
No wonder, Cuccia has little trouble putting tonight's game in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come so far -- we're a Cinderella team," Cuccia said with asmile. 
</P>
<P>
"If we lose, hey, a lot of people's hearts will be broken. But I think you have 
to reflect back on the season." Cuccia, who has two kids of his own, takes 
pride in building not only football players, but disciplined, responsible 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can accomplish that, we'll be successful," he said. "Not only on the 
football field, but in the classroom and beyond school."

GAGLIANO STILL RUNS WITH THE YOUNG LIONS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: VETERAN QUARTERBACK FROM GLENDALE COMPETES AGAINST PEETE AND WARE 
FOR STARTING JOB IN DETROIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The run-and-shoot offense, geared for a thinking quarterback with quick feet 
and a strong arm, appears to be tailor-made for quarterbacks such as Rodney 
Peete and Andre Ware, but it also seems to suit Bob Gagliano. 
</P>
<P>
When Gagliano dons his silver-and-blue uniform and plays quarterback for the 
Detroit Lions, leaving Peete and Ware wearing the headsets, the former Hoover 
High and Glendale College standout appears dressed to kill. 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano, in his seventh NFL season, has led the explosive Lions to three of 
their four victories, but currently rates as the team's second-string 
quarterback behind Peete. Gagliano has completed 87 of 159 for 1,190 yards and 
10 touchdowns, while Peete is 100 of 191 for 1,339 yards and nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to accept whatever role they give you, but I want to play as much as 
possible," said Gagliano, who resides in Ventura during the off-season. "I 
don't look at this as a problem or a controversy; it is up to (Coach Wayne 
Fontes) to choose. It may put some pressure on us quarterbacks, but we are 
adults and we can handle it. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodney and Andre are about as mature as two young men can be. When the 
quarterback controversy comes up, most people talk about them and my name 
doesn't come up. I just kind of laugh about it, because I am right here, and 
Andre and Rodney know I'm here too." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't figure that Gagliano would see much action given the other 
quarterbacks on the Lions' roster, especially when one compares their college 
careers. As a senior at USC, Peete was runner-up for the 1988 Heisman trophy. 
Former Houston quarterback Ware won the award last season. 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano, meanwhile, did not get a single Heisman vote for his play at U.S. 
International University in 1979 or Utah State in 1980. His name was not found 
on any All-American lists. 
</P>
<P>
But there is only one vote that Gagliano wants right now: the endorsement of 
Fontes to be the Lions' starter. 
</P>
<P>
His performance against the Denver Broncos on Thanksgiving Day seemed to be the 
showing Gagliano needed. Gagliano completed 18 of 30 passes for 248 yards and 
three touchdowns in the Lions' 40-27 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Gagliano was on the bench for the Lions' next game, two Sundays ago against 
Chicago. Gagliano was summoned for action with just over 10 minutes left in the 
third quarter when Peete had trouble moving the offense. Gagliano nearly 
engineered an upset, completing 10 of 19 passes for 128 yards and a touchdown. 
In overtime, he drove the team into position to win on a field goal, but kicker 
Eddie Murray missed a 35-yard attempt and the Bears scored on their next 
possession to squeak out a 23-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's 38-31 loss to the Raiders was the first game in the last six in 
which Gagliano had not played. Peete led the Lions to a quick start, but his 
play deteriorated over the next three quarters. Peete finished 11 of 24 for 178 
yards and one touchdown and had one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Peete will be the starter for Sunday night's rematch against Chicago at 
the Pontiac Silverdome, and Gagliano will be on the bench, needed only if Peete 
should falter. 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano emerged as a bona fide NFL quarterback while taking snaps during the 
Lions' 5-0 finish at the end of the 1989 season. In that run, Gagliano 
completed 64 of 118 passes for 882 yards, five touchdowns and threw only two 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the five-game winning streak at the end of last season, Bob 
Gagliano's name keeps coming up," Fontes said before this season. "But, his 
play wasn't a big surprise to us. We, as a staff, felt that if Rodney got hurt 
that Bob was a very capable quarterback, and he proved that." 
</P>
<P>
As fate would have it, Peete did get hurt this season. Peete started the first 
four games before an injury to his left hamstring forced him to the sidelines. 
Given another chance, Gagliano led the team to a come-from-behind 34-27 victory 
at Minnesota, completing 16 of 31 passes for 299 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Evaluating the quarterback controversy after the Minnesota win, Fontes told 
reporters: "Rodney has the better skills. The guy with the best touch (Ware) is 
waiting his turn on the bench. (Gagliano) made the plays when he had to." 
</P>
<P>
The "Silver Stretch," the sobriquet for Detroit's free-wheeling offense, still 
needs improvement. Gagliano completed only five of 11 passes for 113 yards and 
the Lions blew a 21-point lead in a 41-38 loss to the Washington Redskins on 
Nov. 4. Gagliano replaced Ware in the third quarter of the rookie's first start 
against Minnesota the following week, going eight for 13 for 84 yards and a 
touchdown, but Detroit lost the Nov. 11 rematch with the Vikings, 17-7. The 
Lions were shut out by the New York Giants, 20-0, one week later. Gagliano was 
17 of 25 for 123 yards in that game. 
</P>
<P>
Peete was impressive in his return from hamstring problems as the Lions 
defeated the New Orleans Saints on Oct. 28, but he injured his knee when facing 
the Redskins a week later. The injury raised questions about Peete's 
durability, a concern that also dogged Peete at the end of his college career. 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano, 32, is one of the oldest practitioners of the run-and-shoot, giving 
him a decided edge in experience. He became familiar with the schemes of Lions' 
offensive coaches Mouse Davis and June Jones in 1984 while playing for the 
Denver Gold of the USFL. Davis was the Gold's offensive coordinator in 1984 and 
the team's head coach in 1985. Jones was quarterback coach both years. 
</P>
<P>
But Gagliano served an apprenticeship from 1981-83 in a conventional offense 
with the Kansas City Chiefs before he was introduced to the run-and-shoot. 
Gagliano attempted only one pass during those three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think that the stretch is all I've done," said Gagliano, who 
also played for the San Francisco 49ers from 1986-87. "When Mouse and June 
brought me to Denver in 1984, the run-and-shoot was something I didn't think I 
could run. 
</P>
<P>
"It turns out you don't have to be a sprint-out quarterback. The offense 
involves quick reads, which I have learned to do. I'm good with the short game, 
making the quick reads and hitting the seams. You need to be able to make quick 
decisions. Once it becomes inbred in the players, running the system becomes 
second nature." 
</P>
<P>
Jones played quarterback for Davis while the offense was being developed at 
Portland State in the mid-'70s. After playing for the Atlanta Falcons as a 
backup to Steve Bartkowski from 1977-79 and in 1981, Jones became an assistant 
coach for the Houston Oilers. Having observed many quarterbacks, Jones feels 
Gagliano has the tools to succeed in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob has a good understanding of what we are doing, but he would have success 
in any system. He has enough ability and enough poise to make it as a 
quarterback, he has just never really had an opportunity to make it until he 
joined us in the USFL." 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano looks weary and worn compared to youthful media darlings Peete, 24, 
and Ware, 22. He has the appearance of a soldier who has lived through the 
battles of pro football and he tells his tale as if it were a war story. 
</P>
<P>
Experience might have earned Gagliano a place on the roster, but it has come 
back to hurt him as he tries to gain the starting job. Most fans see Gagliano's 
role as that of the sage, imparting wisdom to the new warriors. The depiction 
of Gagliano as the grizzled veteran who survives on intellect in his battle 
with superior athletes doesn't thrill him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about my intellect," Gagliano said with a laugh, "but my athletic 
ability is downplayed and I feel like I have a whole lot more than anybody has 
ever given me credit for. I can run around in the pocket better than most 
quarterbacks and I have good arm strength. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of fallacies about me. One year, the book on me was that I had 
no mobility and no arm strength, which is totally ridiculous. People will say 
something, and once it gets in the press, it will kind of stick with you. You 
have to prove it over a couple of years to show that people were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers have been there. Even when I have done that, people haven't given 
me credit for it. Against Minnesota, I passed for 300 yards and three 
touchdowns. So I have had to learn not to worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
His role on the team has earned him the nickname "The Caretaker" from his 
teammates. If Gagliano ever gets tired of that moniker, he might find himself 
being called "The Baby-sitter" or "The Teacher." He is not perceived as the 
leader who can restore the roar for the Lions; meanwhile Peete and Ware are 
burdened with the expectation of being the next great Lion leader. Detroit fans 
have waited for a worthy quarterback since Bobby Layne led the Lions to two of 
their three NFL titles in the 1950s and have longed for a quarterback with star 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a tough situation for quarterbacks around here for years," Peete 
said. "Bob is a very good quarterback. The fact that he has been around the 
league for years makes people think of him as 'the crafty veteran,' but we as 
quarterbacks try not to pay attention when people start to label you. I've been 
through it and I've learned you can't let it hinder your play." 
</P>
<P>
Fans have given Gagliano a grace period and will allow him to survive on his 
wits and competitiveness. But when Peete's or Ware's talents force Gagliano to 
accept his age and make Ventura his year-around address, he is expected to 
acquiesce and pass the torch. 
</P>
<P>
Yet his own experiences at the start of his pro career have taught him that no 
one can rejuvenate a team overnight. He has tried to provide this insight to 
Peete and Ware. 
</P>
<P>
"He tells me the little things that help as I learn the offense," Ware said. 
"The controversy is just made up by the guys writing. We are pretty good 
friends and we try to help each other out. We want to help each other out. It 
is competitive on the field, but we are friendly in the locker room. That's the 
way it should be." 
</P>
<P>
What enables Gagliano to become friends with the quarterbacks he must compete 
against is a mellow personality and dry wit. 
</P>
<P>
These traits grew out of necessity. Gagliano's demeanor was much different when 
he first came into the NFL, as a 12th-round selection by Kansas City in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"My first year, I was kind of an uppity, wild young man," Gagliano said. "I 
wasn't going to get the opportunity to play with Bill Kenney and Steve Fuller 
there. In the preseason, I would play, move the team and score, then get pulled 
out of the game. I would get so angry. 
</P>
<P>
"That went on for two years, before I realized I had a lot to learn about the 
NFL and being a good quarterback. It was right around then that my roommate, 
(former linebacker) Gary Spani, gave me the key when he told me, 'No matter 
what, stay even-keeled.' I learned not to get too high about the highs, and not 
to get too low about the lows." 
</P>
<P>
Looking cool, calm and collected in the face of stiff competition from two 
potential stars, Gagliano earned a one-year, $300,000 contract this season. 
</P>
<P>
His $130,000 raise proved that he had earned the respect of the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
But he might have to perform like Joe Montana, Terry Bradshaw or another Super 
Bowl quarterback before Lion fans will accept him as the team's unquestioned 
leader.

HARTMAN LINKS HIS STRONG EFFORT TO ILLNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not often that an athlete benefits from an illness before a major 
competition, but Canyon High senior Dave Hartman credited a cold for his 
third-place finish in the Kinney national cross-country championships at San 
Diego's Morley Field on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman, who finished third in the Kinney West Regionals in Fresno on Dec. 1, 
came down with a cold early last week, but instead of it weakening him, the 
illness served as a relaxant. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I got sick, I was pretty nervous about nationals," Hartman said. "I'd 
been shooting for a top-five finish all year, but when I got sick, I lowered my 
goal to the top 15. And that helped me relax." 
</P>
<P>
No longer worried about finishing among the leaders, Hartman ran conservatively 
for the first half of the race before moving into 11th place at the two-mile 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Angel Martinez (of San Gabriel High) was leading a pack of about 10 guys for 
the first half of the race, so I just tried to stick with them," Hartman 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
At 2 1/2 miles, Hartman surged up the final hill on the two-loop, 5,000-meter 
course, moving from 10th to fourth, and with 500 yards left, he swooped past 
Kevin Hogan of New York to take third. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman's time of 15 minutes 21 seconds was slow compared to previous 
third-place finishes in the national meet, but temperatures in the mid-80s had 
a lot to do with that. 
</P>
<P>
Winner Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande won in 15:07.2, the slowest winning time 
in the race's 12-year history. 
</P>
<P>
For comparison, Agoura's Bryan Dameworth won the 1989 race in 14:49.9. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia question: Dameworth, who finished fourth in 1988, and Hartman are two of 
three Valley-area runners who have placed among the top five in the boys' race 
in the Kinney meet. 
</P>
<P>
Who is the other? 
</P>
<P>
Negative trend: Agoura High senior Deena Drossin figured that this year was 
going to be different. 
</P>
<P>
After running below par at three previous national championships, she entered 
Saturday's race undefeated and fresh off a course record-tying effort at the 
West regionals. 
</P>
<P>
She was picked to finish second behind defending champion Melody Fairchild of 
Colorado on pre-meet form charts, but faded to sixth after leading at the mile 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I just went out too fast," said Drossin, who woke up with a cold 
Sunday and missed school Monday. "I don't think the cold affected me at all. I 
felt strong, but I just went out really fast and Melody ran a superb tactical 
race." 
</P>
<P>
Fairchild, who finished second in the Kinney meet in 1988, set a course record 
of 16:39.3 over the 5,000-meter distance, despite the heat, while Drossin ran 
17:53.1, 2.2 seconds slower than her personal best on the Morley Field course, 
set as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"(Deena) was very, very disappointed," Agoura Coach Bill Duley said. "I don't 
know if she was sick, or if she was feeling the pressure, or if it was a 
combination of the two, but she ran well off what she's capable of running." 
</P>
<P>
Drossin, who won her third state Division I cross-country title last month, and 
placed 11th, 17th and 13th in three previous Kinney meets, said that pre-meet 
pressure did not affect her. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually run better when I'm one of the favorites," she said. "A lot of 
runners don't like that, but I've always run my best in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
Add championships: The Kinney meet signaled the end of the 1990 cross-country 
season, but Hartman and Drossin both plan to compete in the U. S. World Junior 
(19 and under) cross-country trials in Tallahassee, Fla., on Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The top six finishers at the junior meet will qualify for the national team 
that will run in the World Junior championships in Antwerp, Belgium, in March. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin finished third in last year's U. S. junior meet in Seattle, and 73rd at 
the World Junior Championships in Aix-les-Bains, France. 
</P>
<P>
Dominating finish: Billed as the finest all-around high school cross-country 
league in the nation this season, the Marmonte League did nothing to tarnish 
its reputation in the girls' race. 
</P>
<P>
Led by the second-place finish of Jeannie Rothman of Westlake, runners from the 
Marmonte League finished second, fifth and sixth, and were the top three 
finishers from the West region. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman, runner-up to Drossin in the West regionals and 16th in last year's 
meet, ran 17:38.4, followed by Veronica Barajas of Channel Islands (17:47.5) 
and Drossin. 
</P>
<P>
Barajas, a junior who placed eighth in the West regionals, established herself 
as one of the early favorites for next year's race, as she was the No. 2 
underclassmen behind Amanda White of Maryland, who finished third in 17:40.7. 
</P>
<P>
Add Rothman: Rothman's runner-up finish was the highest ever for a girl from 
the Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Cook placed third in the 1980 championships for Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Eric Reynolds of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, who ran 8:44.0 in the two-mile as a Scorpion senior, won nationals in 
1982 after placing third in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Night court: The Notre Dame boys' basketball team had some time to reflect on 
its victory over Culver City in the first round of the Beverly Hills tournament 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights' bus departed without the team, forcing the players to wait several 
hours before rides could be arranged to transport them home. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just miscommunication," Coach Mick Cady said. "The (bus driver) thought 
he would just drop us off and that would be it." 
</P>
<P>
Releaguing proposal: The Burbank basketball team has only one player over 
6-foot-1 on its 12-man roster. The tallest player is 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Fred Cook is projecting the Bulldogs to finish somewhere in the middle of 
the pack in the Foothill League, but believes that Burbank could dominate in 
another league. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could play in a six-foot-and-under league, we would be awesome," Cook 
said. "We were undefeated against teams our size this summer." 
</P>
<P>
No excuses: Hart lost two out of three in the Amador Valley tournament in 
Northern California last week, but Coach Greg Herrick was pleased with the 
team's performance with the exception of an 83-69 loss to Union City Logan in 
the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (3-4) led, 61-60, in the fourth period, but the Indians were able to 
convert only nine of 24 foul shots and faltered down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"It couldn't have been the trip. We flew up there (to Oakland) in less time 
than it takes to drive to Alhambra," Herrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a break: Harvard (4-1) won the championship of the Faith Baptist 
tournament last week with a 64-59 victory over Bishop Diego in the title game, 
playing four games within a five-day span. 
</P>
<P>
However, as a result of a scheduling conflict, the Saracens will be idle until 
a nonleague game against Blair on Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't anywhere near where we want to be," Coach Greg Hilliard said. "We're 
improving, but we could use the time off. We'll get to play in another 
tournament and hopefully we'll manage to get some games." 
</P>
<P>
Unsolved mystery: Paraclete is shooting 46% from the field, but only 45% from 
the free-throw line, converting only 36 of 80 shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Spirits shot 18.1% (two of 11) from the line in a 60-58 win over Trona and 
31.2% (five for 16) in a 75-74 loss to Rosamond. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Andy Gavel has emphasized free-throw shooting in practice, but can't seem 
to pinpoint the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried shooting in silence and with music," Gavel said. "We've done 
everything, but play strip free throws." 
</P>

DIGEST: CSUN SEEKS EXTRA YEAR FOR DEVAUGHN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For weeks Cal State Northridge football coaches have been under the impression 
they were losing their top three tailbacks -- seniors Albert Fann, Victor 
DeVaughn and Oscar Pittman. 
</P>
<P>
According to DeVaughn, they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
He says he was a member of the Eastern Utah football team in 1986, but that he 
didn't play. After sitting out a season, he spent the 1988 and '89 seasons at 
Grossmont College before transferring to CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will need to document DeVaughn's claim before granting him another 
season of eligibility. Larry Severied, a former assistant coach at Eastern 
Utah, says he remembers DeVaughn playing some, but perhaps not enough for it to 
count as anything but a redshirt year. Eastern Utah dropped football after the 
1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
As Fann's understudy, DeVaughn (6-foot, 210 pounds) carried 34 times for 246 
yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The West Valley Eagles bantam (9- and 10-year-old) girls' team won its division 
at The Athletics Congress National Junior Olympics cross-country championships 
at Tranquility Park in Omaha, Neb., on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles totaled 40 points, 20 ahead of the runner-up team from Reno. West 
Valley was led by Brandi Plasschaert, who finished second with a time of 12 
minutes 33 seconds over the two-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank Bandits will play the West Los Angeles Falcons on Sunday for the 
championship of the High Desert Football League. 
</P>
<P>
The game is scheduled for 1 p.m. at Caltech in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The Bandits advanced to the championship game last Sunday with a 30-14 victory 
over the Antelope Valley Crusaders. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons have won the league title three of the past four years.

FULLERTON GIRL'S KILLER GIVEN 26 YEARS TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge sentenced 21-year-old Michael Robert Pacewitz to 26 years to life in 
prison plus a separate life term today for a night of violence that resulted in 
the stabbing death of a 3-year-old Fullerton girl, the attempted murder of his 
mother and a knife assault on her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge Richard L. Weatherspoon also included a recommendation 
to state corrections authorities that Pacewitz serve his sentence at a prison 
mental facility at Vacaville. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly recommend that he be sent to Vacaville at the earliest possible 
moment," Weatherspoon added in his sentencing report. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's mother and father urged the court to give the maximum possible 
sentence to Pacewitz. Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown then leaned over the 
rail and asked Pacewitz's mother, Elena Fontaine, if she wanted to say 
anything. She started to speak, but fighting tears, finally shook her head no. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Pacewitz killed the little girl to get back at his 
mother. Fontaine used to baby-sit for her and treated her like a granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz had called the police March 3 after stabbing 3-year-old Marcelline 
Onick 44 times while she slept next to her baby brother, who was unharmed, in 
the Fullerton apartment where he was baby-sitting. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours earlier, Pacewitz stabbed his own mother repeatedly at her Anaheim 
home, nearly killing her, and assaulted her boyfriend who had run into the room 
to try to help her. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz first told news reporters in jailhouse interviews that Satan told him 
to kill the girl. But later, he changed that to say that he thought the little 
girl, and his mother earlier that night, were Satan. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors who convicted him in just one day then deliberated another eight 
days before deciding Pacewitz was sane. Most of them said later they didn't 
believe any of the Satan story. 
</P>
<P>
At today's sentencing hearing, the little girl's mother, Joann Boydston, told 
the court that the crime had not only cost her daughter's life, but resulted in 
the loss of her job, her apartment, her career goals, and a six-month 
separation from her son, who had been sent to the Orangewood Children's Home 
after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"This crime was senseless and morbid. Michael Pacewitz is a menace to society 
and will be a danger to the public if ever turned loose," she said.

Chrysler Corp., the nation's No. 3 auto company, said today that Los Angeles 
investor Kirk Kerkorian has bought more than 9% of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
The auto maker said Kerkorian, who formerly owned Hollywood studio MGM/UA 
Communications Co., did not explain the reasons for his investment, which is 
worth about $240 million at current market prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what the heck he's up to," a Chrysler spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The company made the statement after its stock was halted on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian has built a fortune of more than $1 billion, in large part by buying 
and selling stakes in MGM/UA. He sold the company in November to the Italian 
company Pathe Communications Corp. for $1.3 billion.

<P>
Arson is suspected and investigators found traces of flammable liquids in the 
building, Callaway said.

<P>
Six stores located within the building were damaged and an appliance store and 
a neighboring carpet store were a total loss, he said.

The president of the African National Congress today said the black opposition 
group should reconsider its support for international sanctions imposed on 
South Africa to protest apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Tambo, who a day earlier returned to South Africa after 30 years in 
exile, told the opening session of the ANC's consultative conference the group 
had to reconsider its strategy to recognize South Africa's changing political 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
"It is no longer enough for us to repeat the tried slogans," he said in a 
speech that could mark a major change in the ANC's position on sanctions. It 
was the first conference of the formerly banned ANC in South Africa in more 
than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We should therefore carefully re-evaluate the advisability of insisting on the 
retention of sanctions given the new developments in the country and abroad," 
the 73-year-old leader said.

3 STABBINGS SPARK ANTI-ARAB RIOTING IN ISRAEL

Palestinians stabbed three Jews to death in an aluminum factory today and 
sprayed Muslim fundamentalist slogans on the walls before fleeing, police said. 
The killings sparked anti-Arab rioting and cries for vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
The latest in a string of knife attacks on Jewish civilians also brought 
demands from Israeli right-wingers for a crackdown on Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Police Minister Ronni Milo warned of a "harsh and unequivocal response" to such 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The slayings in the mixed Arab-Jewish town of Jaffa, next to Tel Aviv, brought 
Jewish mobs onto the streets, stoning cars, attacking Arab passers-by and 
clamoring for vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the attack is thought to have been the work of an Arab from the 
occupied Gaza Strip who works at the factory, and one accomplice. Both are 
being sought, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The attackers apparently waited outside the Alum Shin plant until two Jewish 
employees arrived and escorted them in. They then stabbed Iris Asraf, a 
22-year-old secretary, metal cutter Moshe Awan, 40, and Yehoshua Hakmaz, 30, an 
upholsterer working next door who ran to help after hearing screams, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies were found about 8:30 a.m. when another secretary arrived, found 
knives and pools of blood on the floor and called for help, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not allow reporters into the factory. They said slogans in black 
paint on the walls claimed responsibility on behalf of Hamas, an Islamic 
fundamentalist underground group. 
</P>
<P>
Hamas, which marked the third anniversary of its foundation today, had called 
on Palestinians to mark the date by escalating their uprising against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Paramilitary border police poured into Jaffa to reinforce police coping with 
crowds of angry Jews. The rioters torched a car with a Gaza license plate and 
besieged a coffee shop where an Arab had taken refuge behind the police. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's do to them what they do to us!" bellowed one man. "If we aren't safe 
among them, they shouldn't be safe among us!" 
</P>
<P>
Police said three Arab cars were damaged, one Arab was slightly injured by a 
knife and three Jews were arrested.

An Imperial Japanese army major left behind an affidavit saying the army dumped 
the bodies of 150,000 Chinese into the Yangtze River during the 1937 "Rape of 
Nanking," the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Hisao Ohta's 44-page confession is further evidence of the existence and 
the extent of the massacre, which some Japanese right-wing historians and 
politicians say never occurred. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ohta's confession, written while he awaited trial in 1954 in 
Fushun, his army unit dumped the bodies of 19,000 Chinese into the water at the 
Nanking river front over three days starting on Dec. 15, 1937. 
</P>
<P>
A neighboring unit "processed" 81,000 victims at the same time, and elsewhere 
in Nanking, units took care of another 50,000, Ohta's confession, preserved in 
China's Nanking Massacre Memorial Hall, says.

A teen-ager who hid from killers for more than a year testified today that a 
rancher on trial for slaying rain forest defender Chico Mendes made plans to 
celebrate the murder with a barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
Genezio Barbosa da Silva, 15, a farmhand, was considered the star witness in 
the trial of Darly Alves da Silva, accused of plotting Mendes' 1988 killing. 
</P>
<P>
The boy is a distant relative of the accused. 
</P>
<P>
In dramatic testimony on the third day of the trial, the youth also recounted 
in gruesome detail seven murders that he said were committed by the rancher's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Alves da Silva's son, Darci Alves Pereira, stunned the court on the first day 
of the trial Wednesday by confessing to the slaying, but prosecutors contend 
that he made the statement to keep his father from being implicated. 
</P>
<P>
Today was the first day of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Genezio said he was lying in bed the night Mendes was shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It was about 9 o'clock," he said. "I heard Darci coming, running. Darly was 
waiting for him on the front porch. Darci said, 'Mendes is dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
He said that Darly replied to his son, "The cow is caught. Tomorrow we'll cook 
another for the barbecue." 
</P>
<P>
"I was frightened and stayed in my bed," Genezio said. 
</P>
<P>
There were gasps in the courtroom as the boy testified. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, Adair Longhini, asked Genezio if he knew that Alves da Silva wanted 
to kill Chico Mendes. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," the boy said. "I knew for a while that he wanted to kill him."

Prince Johannes von Thurn and Taxis, considered one of Europe's richest men 
with a global empire worth more than $1 billion, died today after his second 
heart transplant in seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The prince, 64, whose ancestors created the postal service in central Europe 
500 years ago, ruled over a global empire of companies, properties and real 
estate worth an estimated $1.3 billion to $3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife Gloria, 30, and three children. 
</P>
<P>
He had suffered from heart disease for several years and received a first heart 
transplant Oct. 26. Several days ago, his body rejected the donated heart and 
another transplant was needed. Surgeons operated again Wednesday, but his body 
was too weak to recover from the second transplant, physicians said.

NCR REJECTS AT&amp;T'S $90-A-SHARE BID AS 'GROSSLY INADEQUATE'

<P>
NCR Corp. said today that its board of directors unanimously rejected American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s $90-a-share cash tender offer for the computer 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, NCR called the hostile takeover bid "grossly inadequate and 
unfair." 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, AT&amp;T is attempting, for its own purposes, to take advantage of 
NCR's artificially and temporarily depressed stock price," NCR Chairman Charles 
E. Exley Jr. said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot and will not permit them to seize for themselves the enormous values 
that are building steadily within NCR," Exley said. "Having 'just said no' to 
this grossly inadequate offer, we are focused on implementing the business 
strategy that will continue to build very real and very significant value for 
NCR shareholders, customers and employees." 
</P>
<P>
NCR's board met Thursday in New York, the company said. It was the board's 
first meeting since AT&amp;T launched the $6.1-billion tender offer Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, NCR had 10 days -- until next 
Wednesday -- to advise stockholders on the bid and to file an opinion with the 
SEC. 
</P>
<P>
NCR also said it filed amendments today to a lawsuit it had filed earlier in 
U.S. District Court in Dayton, Ohio, its headquarters city. The suit seeks to 
have NCR's anti-takeover plan declared valid. 
</P>
<P>
The amendments allege that AT&amp;T's government filings for its tender offer 
are "false, manipulative and misleading" and that they violate federal 
securities law. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T spokesman Walter Murphy said the phone company had no immediate 
comment on the amended suit. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, AT&amp;T said it was disappointed by the NCR board's rejection 
of the tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Our $90-per-share price is a full, fair offer, as we believe NCR shareholders, 
if given the opportunity to decide, would agree," the phone company said in a 
statement.

WHOLESALE INFLATION SURGES 0.5%;

ECONOMY: PRICE INCREASES IN FOOD, TOBACCO AND AUTOMOBILES BRING THE ANNUAL 
INFLATION RATE TO 6.1%.

<P>
Inflation at the wholesale level surged an unexpectedly high 0.5% in November, 
the Labor Department said today, as slightly cheaper oil failed to offset 
costlier food, tobacco and automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another terrible number. 
</P>
<P>
We have not gotten rid of inflation," said economist Michael K. Evans, a 
Washington consultant. The increase translates into a 6.1% annual inflation 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the advance in the Producer Price Index, which followed 
October's steep 1.1% spurt, may delay any Federal Reserve Board move to lower 
interest rates. Most economists had anticipated a wholesale price rise of 0.1% 
to 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
The core rate of wholesale inflation -- considered a more reliable indicator of 
long-term price trends because it excludes the volatile food and energy costs 
-- also gained 0.5%, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the surge in the core rate appeared to reflect the impact of 
higher costs for petroleum-based products. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the overall PPI increase was in food, tobacco and car prices, 
economists said. Tobacco makers raised prices on their products to beat a 
federal tax that takes effect in January, and auto makers eliminated some 
discounts last month, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
In another economic report today, the Federal Reserve said industrial 
production weakened in November for the third straight month, falling back 1.7% 
to the lowest level since last January. It was the steepest decline since 
output plunged 2% in December, 1982, as the nation began crawling out of the 
last recession. 
</P>
<P>
And the Commerce Department reported that business inventories rose 0.4% in 
October, a moderate increase that analysts say is unlikely to accelerate 
already growing unemployment.

DETMER INSISTS HE'LL RETURN FOR HIS SENIOR SEASON AT BYU

Heisman Trophy winner Ty Detmer insists he'll return to school as a senior and 
wait until after graduation to enter the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
The junior quarterback, who Thursday added the Maxwell Award to his trophy 
case, repeated his intention to return to Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, I made a commitment to the school and I believe in living up to 
that," Detmer said in a telephone interview with former college and NFL Coach 
Dick Vermeil. "I'm just enjoying school right now. I don't think I'm ready to 
go on my own yet. There is no reason for me to leave right now." 
</P>
<P>
Detmer's statement was reminiscent of two other juniors, quarterback Andre Ware 
of Houston and running back Barry Sanders of Oklahoma State, who uttered 
similar sentiments after winning the previous two Heisman Trophys. They 
insisted they were going back to school for their senior year, but both changed 
their mind and are with the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer didn't say his intentions were etched in stone. 
</P>
<P>
Vermeil, former head coach at UCLA and with the Philadelphia Eagles, covered 
Detmer in two games this season as an analyst for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a kid throw the ball more accurately. Now he's not the biggest 
guy. He's not the most elusive guy. He's just one of those guys who is gifted 
when it comes to throwing the football where it has to be to be completed," 
Vermeil said. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder how great he would be if he only had to throw the ball 35 times a 
game (instead of 50 or more)) and the offense ran 35 times a game. I think then 
it would magnify how efficient he is as a passer. He throws the ball a lot. I 
think he probably will be a very fine NFL quarterback."

NOTRE DAME DENIES HOLTZ REPORTS

Notre Dame officials denied a report that football Coach Lou Holtz is stepping 
up efforts to become head coach of the Minnesota Vikings or Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
Columnist Paul Domowitch of the Philadelphia Daily News on Thursday quoted 
unidentified sources as saying the impetus for Holtz's job hunt is the NCAA's 2 
1/2-year investigation of the University of Minnesota, where Holtz coached in 
1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Daily News report on Holtz, Notre Dame Sports Information 
Director John Heisler said: "I think there's a lot of misinformation in the 
story. This has been answered. At every press conference we've had in the last 
six weeks, he (Holtz) has said he's not contacted anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not looking for another job. He'll be back at Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
The Daily News said sources told Domowitch that Holtz has an intermediary in 
contact with both Tampa Bay and Minnesota about his interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Tampa job became available two weeks ago when Ray Perkins was fired. 
Vikings Coach Jerry Burns has hinted that he will retire at the end of the 
season.

STUDIOS, NETWORKS BATTLE AGAIN OVER TV RIGHTS;

PROGRAMMING: REGULATORS HEAR TESTIMONY IN DISPUTE OVER FINANCIAL INTEREST IN 
PRIME-TIME PRODUCTIONS. A DECISION IS DUE IN MARCH.

<P>
A galaxy of Hollywood studio and television executives made personal appeals 
today to federal regulators trying to mediate a bitter squabble over who should 
be able to own network TV programs. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the ABC, NBC and CBS TV networks urged the Federal 
Communications Commission to lift rules that prohibit networks from holding a 
financial interest in prime-time programs they obtain from outside sources or 
selling them in the U.S. TV rerun marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"The future of free broadcasting in America is seriously threatened, not just 
for the networks, but for our 600 affiliated stations that provide news, public 
service and local programming in communities across the nation," said Laurence 
Tisch, president of CBS Inc. "Repealing these rules is important because it 
will allow us to compete for the best programming." 
</P>
<P>
However, executives from major Hollywood studios and production companies urged 
retention of the rules, saying that while the industry has changed dramatically 
in the past 20 years the three major television networks still dominate. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps whereas they were once 900-pound gorillas, today they weigh in at only 
850 pounds," said Richard Frank, president of the Walt Disney Studios. 
</P>
<P>
The financial interest and syndication rule was adopted in 1970. It was 
designed to stem network power, encourage independent production of TV shows 
and keep the networks from denying reruns to non-network TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
The networks and studios have been locked in acrimonious negotiations over 
changing the rules since 1983. The networks claim the rules are outdated in an 
era in which ABC, CBS and NBC are not the only outlets for programs and when 
they must compete against foreign interests. 
</P>
<P>
But Hollywood studios and independent producers say the networks are still the 
only outlet for major, high-quality programs and that the rule is essential to 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
"The advertising marketplace is the worst it's been in two decades," said 
Robert Wright, president of NBC. "The three-network percentage of prime time 
viewing" fell to 58% in November, which Wright said was the lowest in history 
as cable television continues to erode network viewing. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has sided with the networks, but a wide array of groups 
are on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
"The rule has fueled the growth of independent stations and -- contrary to 
network contentions -- has also promoted a substantial increase in the number 
of program producers," Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly said. "The networks' 
want repeal so that they may use their tremendous leverage to take valuable 
financial interests and syndication rights." 
</P>
<P>
Daly, a onetime president of CBS Entertainment, said that if the FCC does relax 
the rules, it should adopt minimum safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Cannell, whose company produces such shows as "Hunter" and "Wiseguy," 
said he feared that without safeguards the networks would discriminate in favor 
of their own programs. 
</P>
<P>
"If I refuse to grant ownership of or an interest in my television series, then 
they will be programmed and scheduled in a less desirable fashion than the 
shows in which the networks have an interest," Cannell said. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC tentatively decided in 1983 to eliminate the financial interest rule 
and narrow the syndication rule to prohibit only network participation in 
domestic syndication of prime-time series. But it delayed a final decision 
under pressure from Congress and then-President Ronald Reagan and urged the 
interested parties to find a solution themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the FCC said, it will decide the issue again.

LIZ SMITH: SINATRA BIRTHDAY PARTY -- ALL THE GUESTS WERE IMPRESSED

"DARLING, ALL these years you've given the world beautiful, wonderful music, 
but you have given me the world. . . . One more thought, the fourth time around 
is really lovely!" said Barbara to Frank Sinatra at the private party after his 
Meadowlands concert in New Jersey on Wednesday on the occasion of his 75th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Sinatra was a dedicated and ravishing hostess at the Waldorf in New 
York when about 200 of the creme de la creme of the Sinatra world gathered to 
exude the milk of human kindness together -- because I don't believe there was 
a soul there who wasn't just a little bit "impressed" to have been invited. 
</P>
<P>
I know I was. My fellow scribes Maxine Mesinger and Shirley Eder were also 
there, and Sinatra didn't get mad at any of us -- a night to remember. 
</P>
<P>
First, we had drinks in the Empire Room, where videos of the famous, each 
wishing Sinatra well, were playing. Frank said, "I can look at those later" as 
he worked the room, looking very trim and slim and wearing a red birthday tie. 
</P>
<P>
Then the tributes. Tina Sinatra, weeping: "You are an American treasure. I am 
so grateful that you're 75 and I expect so much more from you because without 
you, I'm nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Jr. attributed his father's long life to his eating properly and never 
letting smoke or alcohol touch his tongue. 
</P>
<P>
Sinatra responded: "These few days have been sensational for me. It was 6,000 
to one that I'd get to be 50 years old; but 75? I love it. I've had some fun in 
the past weeks and a few tears."

NORTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY NEWSPAPER CHAIN IS SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A seven-newspaper chain of weekly publications in San Diego County that 
includes the Carlsbad Journal and Encinitas Coast Dispatch, has been purchased 
by a Rhode Island-based concern whose owners include media mogul Rupert 
Murdoch. Terms of the sale were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The sale, the second change of ownership at North County Community Newspapers 
in less than a year, resulted in layoffs of about 20 employees on Wednesday, a 
15% reduction in payroll, newspaper sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those losing their jobs were eight of the chain's 39 editorial staffers. 
Some management employees were forced to take 5% salary reductions as well. 
</P>
<P>
The new owner is Independent News Corp., a Rhode Island media company whose 
other California properties include The Log, a San Diego yachting publication; 
the Catalina Islander, and Good Times, a Santa Cruz entertainment weekly. 
Independent News Corp. is a "partnership of American and New Zealand interests" 
in which Murdoch owns a minority, non-controlling interest, chain sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The seller is a venture of Bill Lyke, Sunwestern Investment Group and 
Communications Partners, which acquired the chain last January from Times 
Journal Co. of Springfield, Va., editor Dennis Lhota said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lyke group reduced the newspapers' publication to once a week from twice a 
week shortly after assuming ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The other publications being sold are the Del Mar Surfcomber, Rancho Santa Fe 
Times, Solana Beach Sun, Oceanside Breeze and Vista Voice. 
</P>
<P>
The seven community publications have a combined circulation of 20,000, with 
the Carlsbad and Encinitas newspapers leading with 5,000 copies each, Lhota 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the name of the North County chain was changed Thursday to West Coast 
Community Newspapers, no other changes in the newspapers' format are now 
planned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Medeiros has been named new publisher of the chain. For the past three 
years, she has been publisher and chief operating officer of Rhode Island 
Community newspapers, an Independent News Corp. subsidiary.
