HOW A VAIN LITTLE MAN SAVED ENGLAND; 
</P>
<P>
TRAFALGAR COUNTDOWN TO BATTLE, 1803-1805 BY ALAN SCHOM (ATHENEUM: $24.96; 421 
PP., ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Byron Farwell, Farwell is the author of 11 biographies and histories, the 
most recent being Armies of the Raj (Norton) and Ball's Bluff: A Small Battle 
and Its Long Shadow (EPM Publications). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of perhaps only one man can it be truly said: He saved England. Yet Horatio, 
Lord Nelson, the vain little man whose statue stands atop a tall pillar in 
London's Trafalgar Square, is deserving of that accolade, for with inferior 
numbers of men, ships and guns, he crushingly defeated in a single great battle 
the combined fleets of France and Spain, and in so doing he saved Britain from 
a near-certain invasion by Napoleon's armies. 
</P>
<P>
The Battle of Trafalgar (Oct. 21, 1805), was indeed the "greatest British naval 
victory in history." Although often treated as an isolated naval engagement, it 
actually was the culmination of the British Royal Navy's 29-month campaign to 
thwart Napoleon's elaborate invasion plans. 
</P>
<P>
Schom, drawing upon both French and British sources, has here placed the battle 
in its proper historical perspective. In the process, he has given full credit 
to Adm. Sir William Cornwallis (younger brother of the general who surrendered 
to Washington at Yorktown), a modest man who deserved, but failed to receive, 
as much credit as did the honors-avid Nelson for the ruination of Napoleon's 
schemes. 
</P>
<P>
Previous historians have overlooked or disparaged the enormous achievements of 
this exceptional officer, but it was Cornwallis, the "unobtrusive hero," who 
commanded the Channel Fleet, and it was through his mastery of naval strategies 
that Britain was able to control the English Channel for more than two years 
before the Battle of Trafalgar. 
</P>
<P>
In all seasons, Cornwallis' ships successfully blockaded the French and then 
the Spanish ports as well. Not only were the French and Spanish fleets rendered 
otiose, but Napoleon's great armada of 2,343 transports, built at enormous 
expense to carry 167,500 men across the English Channel, was forced to lay idle 
and useless in its ports. 
</P>
<P>
It was Cornwallis who created and sent to do battle with the "Combined Fleet" 
of France and Spain the British fleet commanded by the "more flamboyant and 
charismatic Nelson." Never recognized nor rewarded for his singular 
achievements, Cornwallis was, in fact, relieved of his command soon after 
Trafalgar, and put permanently ashore. 
</P>
<P>
Schom also gives full credit to William Pitt, who became prime minister in May, 
1804, for it was he who raised a mighty army to fight on the beaches should the 
French invade and, more important, reinvigorated a Royal Navy that had become 
run-down and demoralized by neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular interest is the author's full account of the French side of the 
naval campaign: the unique problems they faced and the extraordinary 
personalities involved. Foremost, of course, was Napoleon, declared emperor on 
May 18, 1804. 
</P>
<P>
To say that Napoleon was a difficult man to serve under would be a monumental 
understatement. He never understood naval affairs and he was given to towering 
rages when his admirals refused to obey his commands or were incapable of 
following them. His orders, sometimes capricious, frequently changed too 
quickly to be carried through. He devised no fewer than seven separate plans 
for the invasion of England; none was executed. 
</P>
<P>
It must be admitted that the behavior of some of the French admirals, 
particularly that of the aristocratic Vice Adm. Pierre-Charles Silvestre de 
Villeneuve, would have driven even a mild-tempered leader to distraction. 
Villeneuve, full of excuses for not sailing when ordered, deliberately 
disobeyed Napoleon's direct orders. Even with superior ships in superior 
numbers, he lacked confidence in his ability to defeat the British, and when he 
finally did put to sea from Cadiz it was only because he had learned that his 
replacement was on the way. In the battle off Cape Trafalgar that followed, his 
orders were so erratic that he baffled not only his own admirals and captains 
but Nelson as well. 
</P>
<P>
Schom, a former professor of European and French history, has the rare ability 
to describe naval affairs and naval battles in words readily understood by 
landlubbers. He also obligingly spares the reader the burden of translating 
French quotations. Aided by some simple and excellent drawings, his 
descriptions of the several individual battles which compose the tumultuous 
battle of Trafalgar are superb. This was no easy task, for not only were the 
movements of the ships often complex but, to add to the confusion, engaged in 
the battle were both French and British ships named Surefire, and both a 
British and a French ship namedNeptune and a Spanish Neptuno. Both Nelson and 
Villeneuve had said that they wanted a "pell-mell battle," and the bloody 
conflict that ensued certainly was that. The "Combined Fleet" of 33 ships -- 
six more ships of the line than Nelson could command -- carried 2,568 guns 
compared Britain's 2,148; the French and Spanish ships were manned by nearly 
30,000 men, while Nelson had but 17,000. The men on both sides fought 
valiantly, but the British had the advantage of more experienced sailors and 
more capable commanders. In the end, French naval power was utterly destroyed 
and Napoleon's dreams of the conquest of Britain dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
British casualties at Trafalgar were 1,690, of whom 448 were killed -- 
including Nelson, of course, and two captains. Spanish and French casualties 
were 6,953, of whom 1,038 Spanish sailors and 3,370 French sailors were killed. 
Fourteen of the Spanish admirals and captains and seven of the French were 
killed or wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, Schom does not tell us Nelson's last words, spoken to his flag 
captain ("Kiss me, Hardy"), assuming, one supposes, that they are known to all, 
even to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Deftly drawn biographies bring to life the principal actors in the great drama: 
the admirals, captains, politicians and generals. Lesser but interesting 
characters also enter the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Napoleon was besieged by inventors with new weapons and ingenious devices. 
Among them was Robert Fulton. More interested in his invention than in the 
outcome of the war, he tried to interest both British and French in his 
submarine without success, even though he proved to them that his submersible 
craft worked and that it could launch torpedoes. Among the amateur strategists 
who sought to advise Napoleon was one enthusiast who proposed attacking England 
simultaneously by way of a tunnel, an invasion of ships and an armada of 
hot-air balloons. 
</P>
<P>
If any fault can be found, it is in the author's fondness for exclamation marks 
and italics, a minor quibble for such a thoroughly researched and splendidly 
written book.

</P>
<P>
WONDERFUL WONDERFUL TIMES BY ELFRIEDE JELINEK TRANSLATED FROM GERMAN BY MICHAEL 
HULSE (SERPENT'S TAIL PRESS: $12.95; 253 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Since "Wonderful Wonderful Times" is set in the 1950s gloom of postwar Vienna; 
since everyone in it is crass, corrupt or distorted; and since it ends in a 
horrible blood bath, the title could justifiably be taken as gallows humor of 
the crudest kind. 
</P>
<P>
It is, in fact. Jelinek's characters, and the voice she uses to tell of them, 
are fashioned with black irony and jarring distortion. Yet the ultimate effect 
is grace, a dark image delivered in terms appropriate to it, but in a 
draftsmanship that conveys a hint of delicacy and lyricism, as if these had 
been ejected from the room but continued to haunt it. We think of George Grosz. 
</P>
<P>
Like Thomas Bernhard, her older Austrian compatriot, Elfriede Jelinek writes of 
the still-unsettled accounts of the 20th Century. Austria is the place to do 
it, of course; with the dismemberment of her one-time empire, the bitter chaos 
following World War I, her acceptance of the Nazi version of being German, and 
her abdication of a version of her own. 
</P>
<P>
The unhealed guilts were never confronted they way they largely were in 
Germany. Avoidance is paid for in the figure of an internationally shunned 
president whose history is as unclear as that of his country. And in the harsh, 
surreal denunciation by such writers as Bernhard and Jelinek. 
</P>
<P>
The sleep of memory, like that of reason, produces monsters. Rainer, his twin 
sister Anna, and their buddies Hans and Sophie, are monsters of a sort, as they 
rampage around Vienna. They are teen-agers for whom the word wilding would be 
invented 30 years later; they waylay passersby, rob and savagely beat them. 
</P>
<P>
But Jelinek does not write of this violence as we write of American wilding -- 
as awful and arbitrary acts afflicted upon a troubled but still coherent 
society. It is Vienna, and the society that emerged from its past without 
naming it, that is awful and arbitrary. Monstrosity is the history that the 
four young people breathe. And because it is, Jelinek can endow them with a 
measure of perverted innocence. Fleetingly, we perceive the innocence along 
with the perversion. 
</P>
<P>
When we meet them at the start, the four are at work upon an unfortunate 
innocent who happens to be walking through the park. Anna, thin and perpetually 
raging, concentrates on scratching his face and eyes. Hans, a factory worker, 
punches stolidly away. Sophie, from a rich family, keeps her distance and uses 
the points of her expensive boots. Rainer, the intellectual, does little actual 
damage; he concentrates mainly on fumbling for the wallet. 
</P>
<P>
I referred to the victim as "an innocent," but Jelinek's narrator does not 
altogether agree. Its voice suggests that to have a wallet is already not to be 
altogether innocent. It is a disembodied voice, sardonic, amused, nihilistic, 
with an occasional moralizing phrase that parodies respectability, like a 
teen-ager trying on his aunt's hat. 
</P>
<P>
We hear it describing the initiation of Sophie into the gang. Rainer -- whose 
mother named him after the poet Rilke -- is an existentialist, an admirer of 
Camus and Sartre. When he sits with the others in a cafe, something they do a 
lot of, he tries to practice Sartrean "nausea," though he only manages 
queasiness. Sophie, he decides, must commit an existential free act, so they 
all go off to the Vienna Woods carrying a sack that twitches: 
</P>
<P>
"In Jean-Paul Sartre's 'The Age of Reason' is a character who wants to drown 
his acts, and so today they are planning to drown this cat too, though this cat 
also has a right to live. Rainer says that he himself has an equal right to 
nonexistence, just as this cat does, this cat which he is going to assist on 
its way to nonexistence before it can count to three. The cat has its 
suspicions. Hence the brouhaha in the sack." 
</P>
<P>
Sophie gets her designer dress muddy and botches the job. Hans smacks her on 
the mouth. Both the mud and the smack are piquancies for her; she hangs out 
with the others as a diversion from her privileged life. She brings the gang 
home mainly to annoy her mother; she makes Hans strip and masturbate but won't 
let him touch her. She has the coldness of the rich and powerful, and will 
leave the others at the end to go to school in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Hans, son of the widow of a Communist labor leader, rebuffs his mother's 
efforts to make him socially conscious. He burns her pamphlets; he wants to be 
a rock star; he is besotted with Sophie. Since he can't have her, he has 
energetic sex with Anna. 
</P>
<P>
She, like her brother, is an intellectual, or tries to be. In fact, her 
philosophical fury masks perfectly conventional longings; she falls helplessly 
and romantically in love with Hans. As for Rainer, he too is obsessed with 
Sophie and tries to win her from Hans by talking incessantly. After one of the 
gang's sorties, he begs her to stay with him. "I need someone to explain 
everything to," he says, imagining himself a fashionable savant to whom 
beautiful women are bound to flock the way they do -- he has heard -- in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
If the gang's maraudings and arguments are narrated with a sardonic lightness, 
the comedy is grimmer when it comes to Anna's and Rainer's parents. The father 
is a former SS man, now crippled and working at a humdrum job. He is as filled 
with rage and fantasies as Anna is, but his are real and deadly. 
</P>
<P>
"His one-time enemies got away through the chimneys and crematoria of Auschwitz 
and Treblinka," the narrator savagely tells us. He can't kill Jews, but he can 
beat his wife. He interrupts her cooking to make her strip and pose for 
pornographic photographs; it is hard, he tells himself, for a man to be 
satisfied with one naked alive woman when he has seen piles of naked dead ones. 
For real arousal, he pulls out his pistol and rushes into the kitchen to "rape" 
his wife. She is wearily submissive, but it is necessary for him to think of it 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
Hans, with his rock-star fantasies, represents the corruption of the working 
class; Rainer's father, the corrupt history of the middle class; Sophie's 
all-but-invisible parents, the continuing corruption of the wealthy and 
powerful. Their grotesquerie fills gradually with horror. 
</P>
<P>
Rainer's intellectual fantasies, which have protected him from his own and the 
world's rage, give way in a scene of wild bloodiness. Until then, except for 
the manipulative Sophie, the young people were like frail and jaunty paper 
boats floating in a sewer. Its contents -- Austria's unpurged history of denial 
-- is backed up. Of course, it will rise and engulf them.

HARD TO GET FAST TALK AND RUDE QUESTIONS ALONG THE INTERVIEW TRAIL BY NANCY 
COLLINS (RANDOM HOUSE: $18.95; 357 PP.); 
</P>
<P>
PORTRAITS IN PRINT A COLLECTION OF PROFILES AND THE STORIES BEHIND THEM BY

<TEXT>
<P>
We read interviews to find out who someone really is. One approach attempts to 
reveal the person by making connections between his or her work (presumably the 
reason that anyone would be interested in this person in the first place) and 
his or her life. Another approach focuses on personality. Celebrity journalism 
assumes that it is not the work that interests us but the mystique of success 
-- power, wealth and privilege, not to mention the feuds, friendships and 
sexual adventures with fellow celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
A good example of the latter is "Hard to Get," Nancy Collins' collection of 
interviews. Her subjects include Jack Nicholson, Joan Rivers, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Ted Koppel, Elizabeth Taylor, Roone Arledge, Robin Williams, 
Debra Winger, Bette Midler, Francis Ford Coppola and Mikhail Baryshnikov. Fame 
is what they have in common. 
</P>
<P>
These pieces, originally published in Esquire, Rolling Stone, Interview, New 
York and Playboy, or based on her interviews conducted for the Today Show, 
represent top-of-the-line celebrity journalism. They are not breathless 
encounters limited to such fluffy questions as "What's your definition of 
love?" or "Do you have a basic philosophy when it comes to life?" 
</P>
<P>
The frustrating thing about Collins is that she manages to ask those questions 
anyway. In her introduction (and her preface to each interview), Collins shows 
herself to be hard-working and conscientious. She does her preparation. What's 
missing is a burning interest in her subjects' work. Consequently, she rarely 
shows us what it is that sets these celebrities apart from other people, unless 
it is the money and power to indulge themselves, and the notoriety that makes 
them the subject of public curiosity. When she does ask about a subject's work, 
her questions are too broad. Even with fellow interviewer Ted Koppel, she asks 
only two questions about interviewing, both generic: "How does your 
interviewing technique differ from others'?" and "Have there been times when 
you felt you really blew an interview?" 
</P>
<P>
To Collins' credit, she does penetrate her subjects' personal lives. 
Baryshnikov reveals that his mother committed suicide. Nicholson explains how 
he learned that the woman he thought was his sister was really his mother. But 
Collins immediately redirects the Nicholson interview to the questions: "You 
genuinely like women don't you?" . . . "What attracts you to a woman?" . . . 
"Do you think you're sexy?" -- which leads to silly answers about being "buzzed 
by the female mystique." The problem is that Collins gives as much weight to 
celeb banalities as she does to genuine revelations. 
</P>
<P>
"Hard to Get" reveals as much about Collins as it does about her celebrities. 
Barbara Walters once warned her she's "too pretty to be on television." 
Although Collins tells us that she worries about convincing people that she can 
be tough while remaining glamorous, she comes off sounding like a 
fashion-magazine fantasy of a journalist. "Never walk into an interview under 
six feet -- that's my motto," writes Collins, who hates to cover a story where 
she can't wear high heels. "What God didn't give you, you buy." When she 
interviewed Nicholson over two separate days, she spent $50 each day on a 
professional makeup artist. 
</P>
<P>
What seems to motivate her is the glamour of her beat. She practices celebrity 
journalism as if the ultimate goal were to become a celebrity herself. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the personality questions that Collins routinely asks are questions 
that Helen Benedict, an associate professor of journalism at Columbia 
University, would find trivial or sexist, but is sometimes pressured by her 
editors to ask. Benedict's editors at New York Woman asked her to find out 
about Susan Sontag's sex life, and if she dyes her hair. Benedict turned the 
hair question around to let Sontag talk about self-image, and she didn't bother 
to ask who Sontag had gone to bed with. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of Benedict's profiles, originally published in Esquire, New York, Antioch 
Review and elsewhere, are collected in "Portraits in Print." The book includes 
profiles of Joseph Brodsky, Bernard Malamud, lsaac Bashevis Singer, Paule 
Marshall, Beverly Sills, Leonard Michaels, and a dual portrait of Jessica 
Mitford and her husband Robert Treuhaft. 
</P>
<P>
Benedict gets her subjects thinking aloud. Soviet emigre poet Joseph Brodsky 
admits he doesn't have enough time to master both life and work. "You have to 
fake one, so you fake life." Asked about his grotesque imagery, Yiddish writer 
lsaac Bashevis Singer tells her that "life in itself is kind of grotesque. . . 
. If you go deep into human beings, it is grotesque. Let's say when you are 
with people you behave like any other people. But when you come home, you take 
off your clothes, you daydream, you are a different kind of person. Things are 
not as smooth, you may have passions of which you are ashamed, you may have 
dreams which shock yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who agrees to be interviewed must decide where to draw the line between 
what is public and what is private. But the line can shift, depending on who is 
asking the questions. What puts someone on guard isn't necessarily the fear of 
being "found out." It sometimes is just the fear of being misunderstood. That 
is why a person is likely to be more forthcoming with a reporter who 
demonstrates a grasp of that person's life and work. 
</P>
<P>
You would feel confident entrusting your story to Benedict. She comprehends her 
subject's work and uses it to illuminate his or her character. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, her subjects aren't forthcoming. This was the case with Malamud, 
who was recovering from a heart attack and would agree only to a phone 
interview. Writer Paule Marshall granted a "gracious, but impersonal interview, 
perhaps the most impersonal I have ever had." When the subject holds back, the 
profile bogs down. Neither Benedict's writing style nor her personal 
observations are lively enough to sustain it. 
</P>
<P>
Her writing is more personal and relaxed in the commentary that follows each 
profile. This is where we find out the circumstances behind each interview, and 
the dilemmas she sometimes faces in reporting on private lives. She tells why 
she asked Jessica Mitford's husband Robert Treuhaft for permission to mention 
in print the death of their 11-year-old son, a tragedy that Mitford kept out of 
her own memoirs. Benedict also admits that she agreed to let Leonard Michaels 
"rewrite" his quotes, which she now considers to have been a mistake. "A 
writer's inclination to be kind often clashes with his or her duty to be fair," 
Benedict observes in her introduction. Her commentaries show an intelligent 
reporter wrestling with conflicting instincts. 
</P>
<P>
Benedict's subjects might not be celebrities in quite the same way that 
Collins' are, but her choice of subjects -- weighted toward the 
literary/intellectual establishment -- is, in its own way, as narrow. There has 
been more written about the people that Benedict profiles than about the form 
of journalism she practices. Her commentaries are sometimes more provocative 
than the profiles themselves.

<TEXT>
<P>
The whimsical and poignant 1985 Back to the Future (NBC Sunday at 8 p.m.) finds 
small-town youth Michael J. Fox accidentally sent back in time 30 years, where, 
to his chagrin, he discovers his mother is crazy about him rather than his own 
father. 
</P>
<P>
The Witches of Eastwick (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) was a popular success even 
though it turned the John Updike novel upside down and inside out. Jack 
Nicholson is a joy as a devil of a fellow who materializes in a staid New 
England community in which three single women (Cher, Susan Sarandon and 
Michelle Pfeiffer) pine for some male company. 
</P>
<P>
Call Me (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is an ambitious but flawed 1988 
lady-in-distress thriller about a young Manhattan photographer/reporter 
(Patricia Charbonneau), plagued by both an obscene phone caller and a drug 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia Newton-John makes her dramatic debut on TV in the contemporary fairy 
tale A Mom for Christmas (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
In Leo McCarey's durably sentimental The Bells of St. Mary's (Channel 11 
Tuesday at8 p.m.), an authentic Yuletide treat, priest Bing Crosby skirmishes 
with Ingrid Bergman's doughty mother superior, who is determined to build a new 
parish school. Warning: It's been colorized. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Fletch Lives (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is the ultimate comedy of 
condescension, a movie with a hero whose every other line of dialogue is a 
snide wisecrack, directed at a fool. Starring Chevy Chase, who created Fletch 
in the 1985 movie of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing from personal experience, writer Bo Goldman contributed a script to the 
1982 Shoot the Moon (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) that made it one of the 
year's best, an exceedingly painful and persuasive account of the breakup of a 
marriage. Directed by Alan Parker and starring Albert Finney and Diane Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1982 Diner (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.), Barry Levinson rescues our 
memories of the late '50s and early '60s from the high gloss that TV has put on 
those years and lets them stand tender and real. The film's title comes from a 
Baltimore hangout where recent high school grads Steve Guttenberg, Mickey 
Rourke, Kevin Bacon and Daniel Stern are beginning to feel an edge of 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas in Connecticut (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a warm wartime 
romantic comedy that holds up quite well. Barbara Stanwyck plays a newspaper 
cooking columnist who takes a soldier (Dennis Morgan) home for Christmas dinner 
on orders of her boss (Charles Coburn) -- the only hitch is that she can't 
cook. 
</P>
<P>
Fanny and Alexander (Channel 28 Saturday at 9 p.m.), Ingmar Bergman's great 
1983 farewell to the screen, may begin at a glorious Christmas gathering, but 
this turn-of-the-century test-of-the-spirit saga centers on two children, a 
brother and sister, whose happy existence is swiftly terminated when their 
widowed mother re-marries.

Back Street (AMC Monday at 6:30 p.m., again at 11:30 p.m.). The first (1932) 
film version of the Fannie Hurst novel about a woman who settles for being the 
mistress of the man she loves is not the maudlin tear-jerker it sounds but is 
unexpectedly a jolter in its raw emotional honesty. 
</P>
<P>
Starring Irene Dunne as the good-hearted mistress to John Boles' caddish, 
selfish banker. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheik (AMC Wednesday at 6:30 p.m., again at 12:30 a.m.). This is the 1921 
landmark Rudolph Valentino film in which Valentino, in the title role, kidnaps 
Agnes Ayres' headstrong British girl, intending to make her his bride. Directed 
by George Melford. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Me in St. Louis (TNT Thursday at 5 p.m.). Vincente Minnelli's 1944 
musical, an authentic American classic, with its Technicolor gloriously 
restored, is timeless in its enchantment yet dares to suggest a dark side of a 
more serene age. Set in St. Louis, just before the 1904 World's Fair, and 
starring Judy Garland at her irresistible best.

I was appalled to turn on my favorite late night news program "Nightline" (ABC, 
Dec. 3) and find Madonna and her video the evening's topic. 
</P>
<P>
I called KABC to complain and was further shocked when I was told my opinion 
was "a refreshing change" from the other calls the station was receiving. 
</P>
<P>
My complaint was simple. I objected to Channel 7's use of precious airtime of 
Madonna and her hardly news-worthy video. I was told most calls were complaints 
about morality. 
</P>
<P>
Why don't the news programs just keep us up to date on current crises and leave 
the trash to trash TV?

ANCHORS: Brokaw, Jennings, Rather and the Evening News by Robert Goldberg and 
Gerald J. Goldberg (Birch Lane Press: $19.95; 399 pp.) Every night some 40 to 
60 million Americans learn about the day's events from the three intelligent, 
earnest, white, Protestant men who anchor the network evening news. 
</P>
<P>
Each of them is on camera for about eight minutes. Each receives over $2 
million a year. The Goldbergs (father and son) have written an absolutely 
first-rate examination of the three men, and the way in which the news is put 
together -- as well as the way the network's new corporate owners have changed 
the process of choosing what goes on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Money talks louder than ever: It determines whether a story is really important 
(will it cost too much to cover?). At CBS, one-sixth of the news organization 
was fired in the name of profitability; you have to wonder what stories we 
didn't get to see because there weren't enough people left to cover them. Karen 
Stabiner

A HAND IN THE DARKNESS: The Autobiography of a Refusenik by Ida Nudel (Warner 
Books: $22.95: 314 pp.) In the midst of the euphoria over the political changes 
sweeping through Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, this book stands as a 
cautionary beacon. 
</P>
<P>
Removing state communism from the countries of Eastern Europe, and liberalizing 
it economically in the Soviet Union, has not meant that ethnic hatreds have 
been forgotten. Slav and Czech, Serb and Croatian, all are now freer to hate 
than they were before. 
</P>
<P>
Most reviled of all are the Jews, not so much in Eastern Europe -- the Germans 
saw to that -- but in the Soviet Union. Nudel recounts a life experiencing 
anti-Semitism in Russia, from the children calling her "kike" before World War 
II to the apparatchiks who harassed her unmercifully when she decided to help 
her fellow Jews to emigrate to Israel -- and to act as a solitary angel of 
mercy looking after Jews who were sent to prison camps in Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
She used the telephone, telegraph and mail not only to buoy the spirits of 
prisoners but also to ensure their humane treatment. For her work, she was, 
inevitably, sent to prison, and denied an exit visa for 16 years. But perhaps 
the most depressing fact about her treatment was the verbal abuse from Russians 
who shouted to her that they wished Hitler had finished his job on the Jews -- 
this from people whose own relatives, as many as 20 million of them, were 
slaughtered during the German occupation of Russia. Karen Stabiner

INTER/VIEW: Talks With America's Writing Women by Mickey Pearlman and Katherine 
Usher Henderson (University Press of Kentucky: $25; 224 pp.) It's impossible 
not to greet this book with great affection -- even as you wish that the 
writing about women writers was as good as what those writers write. 
</P>
<P>
Pearlman and Henderson have interviewed 28 women across the country about what 
they do and who they are. The result is an encapsulated study of writers who 
still are considered peripheral members of the literary club, whose careers 
sometimes flounder on professional naivete, who are too often judged on 
criteria they reject. 
</P>
<P>
The entries are fascinating and too short by half. As introductory tidbits, the 
interviews work fine, but they leave the reader desperately hungry for more. If 
only the authors had an 800 number we could call for the unabridged 
transcripts. Karen Stabiner

THE SUMMER OF THE PAYMASTER by Alfred Nielsen (W. W. Norton: $19.95; 379 pp.) 
This riveting book is easy enough on the surface to dismiss as another "coming 
of age" novel centered around a group of boys growing up in the late '60s on 
Staten Island. 
</P>
<P>
But the summer of '68 is a critical one as Andrew (the Chun) Hapanowicz -- 
toiling as a pump jockey at Pete's Mobil station next to the world's largest 
garbage dump -- eagerly, but apprehensively, awaits the return of his special 
best friend, Jimmy Dietz, from Vietnam. The mystic paymaster of the title, a 
roving Mobil Oil representative who prowls the company's filling stations and 
rewards pump jockeys for outstanding work, gives some purpose to the Chun's 
life at a time when his self-worth is under a severe strain. These are tough 
and complex kids, makings for a strong debut novel. Donald G. Campbell

BABY BOOMERS RUNNING IN PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If one considers popular beliefs that fuel ambition, one sees that most people 
associate higher levels of authority with higher levels of pay. In fact, it is 
more or less a universal managerial dogma in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Even though, intuitively, it seems an obvious principle, it is not necessarily 
rational. It stands in opposition to the market principle of supply-and-demand. 
The market value for a particular type of supervisor may be lower than for the 
employees he supervises. So organizations often create unnecessary credentials 
or work-experience requirements to justify higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional system incorrectly presumes that supervisorial and management 
skills are of greater value to the organization's effectiveness and 
profitability than are the skills being supervised. The value of a skill in one 
organization may far exceed the overall market value for that same skill. And 
the contribution of a supervisor is often measurable and less than the overall 
market value for that skill. But, of course, an organization needs to at least 
match the market or lose its employees. 
</P>
<P>
It may be time that the rule of higher authority/higher pay change in the big 
corporations. When it does, then "dead-ending" will no longer warrant 
discussion.

BABY BOOMERS RUNNING IN PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an older baby boomer, I read with interest "The Dead-End Kids." 
</P>
<P>
It occurred to me that you omitted the fastest way to climb the corporate 
ladder. It's called a variety of names: brown nosing, not making waves, company 
politics, networking -- anything to get that promotion. You know and I know the 
old adage: "It's not what you know, it's who you know." 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if it even happens at The Times.

BABY BOOMERS RUNNING IN PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baby boomers are a large and heterogenous group, and I am tired of the media's 
broad portrayals of snot-nosed baby boomers whining over their failed 
expectations ("The Dead-End Kids," by Karen Tumulty, Oct. 28). 
</P>
<P>
There are many of us, professional and nonprofessional alike, who do not 
subscribe to the narrow vision of success that defines itself by the manic 
pursuit of promotions and power. 
</P>
<P>
Those in my peer group are not so lost in fantasy to believe that we can all 
make it to the top; we know that a career "plateau" is as inevitable as death 
or taxes, and to suggest that many or most members of the baby-boom generation 
react to such an event with horror is vexing. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation of personal limitations and failed expectations, furthermore, 
cannot be avoided; it is a rite of passage into maturity and not an experience 
invented anew for the baby-boom generation, as the media continues to suggest. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s hype suggesting that baby boomers believed the world (and our 
ambitions) were without limits -- and that we could all succeed and be 
fabulously rich -- was an invention of the media. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us never did believe in such a world, and we do not mourn the loss of 
such an illusion .

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sonja Bolle and Kenneth Turan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children's books are of course available all year round, but they seem a 
particularly enticing commodity around the holidays. And not only for children, 
who treasure their books in a way that often fades with age, but also for 
moonlighting adults, who can appreciate a level of sophistication in art and 
design that makes these books the biggest bargains on the publishing scene. For 
those who've waited till now to make their selections, here is a last-minute 
look at some of the best this season has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
HAIL TO MAIL by Samuel Marshak (Henry Holt: $14.95). Newly translated by 
Richard Pevear, this delightful tale by Russian children's poet Marshak follows 
a particularly determined certified letter as it follows world traveler John 
Peck from New York to Boise, Switzerland and Brazil before (not to give away 
the ending) it finally catchs up to Mr. Peck back in old New York. Unafraid to 
rhyme "yesterday" with "Schenectady," Hail to Mail is particularly well-served 
by the sophisticated primitivism of Vladimir Radunsky's illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
LITTLE LOU by Jean Claverie (Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang: $14.95). Dedicated to 
Memphis Slim, the piano great who was a longtime fixture on the Paris jazz 
scene, this playfully illustrated work by Frenchman Jean Claverie takes us into 
the Depression-era world of its title character, a small boy who learns about 
Bach and Mozart at piano lessons but finds he has the blues in his soul. A 
gangster attack on a local club add a little excitement to the proceedings and 
give Little Lou his big break. 
</P>
<P>
A CHRISTMAS CAROL by Charles Dickens (Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang: $25; 152 
pp.). and THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW by Washington Irving (Stewart, Tabori and 
Chang: $25; 63 pp.). While it is left to each generation to rediscover the 
classics of children's literature, the virtue of these two new editions 
(published in conjunction with Creative Education Inc. of Mankato, Minnesota) 
is that the illustrations are so rich they immediately feel timeless. Roberto 
Innocenti, a past winner of the Bratislava Golden Apple, among other awards, 
brings a vivid sense of detail to the Dickensian panoply of 19th-Century 
London, capturing its poverty as well as its exuberance. Gary Kelley, by 
contrast, works in broader strokes as recalls the moodiness of the autumnal 
world of New York's Hudson River Valley. 
</P>
<P>
DINOSAUR DREAM by Dennis Nolan (Macmillan: $13.95). Children and dinosaurs have 
been an item for generations, and though "Dinosaur Dreams" is hardly the first 
book to take advantage of that phenomenon, it is one of the most charming. When 
a baby brontosaurus appears outside Wilbur's window, the young lad has no 
choice but to walk the creature back through several strata of time until he 
meets up with the toddler's parents deep in the Jurassic age. If 
author/illustrator Nolan's ideas are not brand spanking new, his breathtaking 
illustrations more than make up for it. 
</P>
<P>
A 19TH CENTURY RAILWAY STATION by Fiona MacDonald, illustrated by John James 
(Peter Bedrick Books: $16.95; 48 pp.; ages 10 and up). Just as Ninja Turtles 
have not quite replaced dinosaurs, space ships have not quite replaced trains 
in the child's imagination. This book, a British import, carries all the 
excitement of a visit to an old-fashioned railway station. With vivid 
description and illustration (the cutaway drawings are unusually clear here), 
the book covers everything from engine models and switching layouts to 
construction of sleeper chairs and modern uses for the old station buildings. 
</P>
<P>
A FLOWER GROWS by Ken Robbins (Dial Books: 12.95; all ages). This picture book 
combines the magic of storytelling with the precision of science instruction. 
Ken Robbins photographed the stages of development of an amaryllis, a 
breathtaking flower whose fast-growing stalk produces a ring of enormous 
trumpet-shaped flowers. Robbins' text explains how the parts of the flower 
unfold, how the plant goes into hibernation, and how it stores nourishment for 
its next flowering. Rather than use straighforward color photographs, Robbins 
shoots in black and white and hand-tints the pictures; this illustration 
technique lends his pictures a luminous beauty that suits the poetry of the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
MY GRANDMOTHER'S STORIES: A Collection of Jewish Folk Tales by Adele Geras, 
illustrated by Jael Jordan (Alfred A. Knopf: $17.95; 96 pp.; all ages). Adele 
Geras tells her tales through the eyes of a little girl visiting her 
grandmother. As she discovers how her grandmother does things, she learns of 
the clever villagers who outfoxed the Czar and the Wise Elders of Chelm who 
pondered their edicts long and hard, as well as her grandmother's own mother, 
the Bobbeh. Jael Jordan's illustrations further tie together the worlds of the 
Old Country and the New -- a pretty package, but one word of caution: This 
collection is not for those who like their folk tales straight up, for the 
questioning between the little girl and her grandmother will make the 
connection between children and their heritage too didactically for some 
tastes. 
</P>
<P>
THE GLORIOUS IMPOSSIBLE by Madeleine L'Engle (Simon &amp; Schuster Books for 
Young Readers: $19.95; all ages). Madeleine L'Engle retells the life of Jesus 
to the accompaniment of illustrations from Giotto's early 14th-Century frescoes 
in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua, Italy. The heart of her celebration of the 
Christmas story lies in the title: Everything about Christ's birth is 
impossible, and yet it happened -- and her text sings "Glory!" The unschooled 
visitor who enters an Italian church is often hard-pressed to follow the story 
told on the walls, but the beauty of this book is how clearly Giotto's 
magnificent panels tell the story when arranged with the parts of the tale.

UP FOR GRABS: A Trip Through Time and Space in the Sunshine State by John 
Rothchild (Penguin: $7.95) John Rothchild tries to blend childhood memories of 
Florida with an irreverent history of the state, but the mixture never quite 
gels. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's humid real estate has spawned nearly as many flamboyant scandals, 
crooks and get-rich-quick schemes as California's, but Rothchild fails to 
capture the baroque excesses of his subject. The narrative flashes backward and 
forward awkwardly, scrambling any sense of continuity and confusing the reader. 
Rothchild's straightforward style lacks devilish edge needed for this type of 
wise-cracking memoir. Charles Solomon

WILLIE MAE by Elizabeth Kytle (EPM: $12.95) Initially published in 1958, 
"Willie Mae" was one of the first books to bring the contemporary problems of 
African-Americans (especially African-American women) to the attention of a 
large national audience. As a teen-ager, Willie Mae Wright had to become a 
"do-er," performing whatever domestic work she could find to feed her younger 
siblings and, later, her children. 
</P>
<P>
This vivid memoir captures the resourceful woman who endured and even enjoyed 
her life of toil. She loved and respected some of her white employers, but had 
no qualms about telling others they were "as common as gully dirt." Although 
Wright's life included dramatic moments that ranged from meeting President 
Franklin Roosevelt to learning her cousin had been shot for voting in a Georgia 
election, it is the ordinariness of her story gives the book its power. Untold 
thousands of women struggled in similar circumstances, and this record of her 
daily trials reveals how much the Civil Right Movement accomplished. Charles 
Solomon

BEYOND THE REVOLUTION: My Life and Times Since Famous Long Ago by Ray Mungo 
(Contemporary Books: $10.95). One of the founders of the Liberation News 
Service and a minor '60s icon, Ray Mungo tells what he's been doing since the 
heady days of the student revolution. 
</P>

(Apparently not much.) He comes across as a not very likeable opportunist, 
smoking dope and partying at other people's expense. Mungo gushes over former 
members of the counterculture he feels have remained true to its ideals (Dick 
Gregory is "a saint") and glosses over the fact that many of them are now 
lawyers, businessmen and real estate agents -- exactly what they swore never to 
become. This former champion of anarchic freedom reports H. Rap Brown's recent 
condemnation of Salman Rushdie without a word of anger or dismay, although the 
reader gets the impression he would rush to defend an author attacked by 
Protestant fundamentalists. Mungo concludes with his credo that Baby Boomers 
"need to stay in touch" and "will be family" -- the Addams Family, perhaps.

THE PRINCE by R.M. Koster (W.W. Norton: $8.95) R. M. Koster received a National 
Book Award nomination for the first volume of his trilogy set in the fictional 
Central American country of Tinieblas. Narrated by the son of a former 
president of Tinieblas, this darkly compelling tale of political intrigue is as 
complex as the history of any real nation. 
</P>
<P>
Although his body was crippled in a botched assassination attempt during his 
own presidential campaign, Kiki Sancudo's mind remains venomously intact. 
Imprisoned in his ruined flesh, he contemplates revenge and reflects on his 
country's curious past, with its numerous elections, coups, dictators, scandals 
and American interventions. Koster's tendency toward hyperbole weakens his 
effort to depict the extremes of Latin American politics: Kiki has been an 
Olympic athlete, a stellar actor, a successful gun runner, a charismatic 
politician, a tireless lover (or satyr; Kiki loves no one but himself) and a 
champion card player with a psychic ability to read the deck, all with a 
minimum of effort. His single-minded devotion to vengeance suggests the 
discipline necessary for his myriad endeavors, but there's no hint of the 
requisite labor. "The Prince" is an ambitious book, but one whose excesses 
sometimes cloak its very real strengths. Charles Solomon

DRY-CURED FOR THE HOLIDAYS

CHAMPAGNE, CAVIAR and silky, smoked salmon are the little black dress and 
pearls of luxurious entertaining. The caviar and the bubbly are easy to get, 
but finding that perfect piece of smoked salmon can be tricky. 
</P>
<P>
Now, just in time for the holidays, there's smoked salmon, one of L'Ermitage's 
signature dishes, which is made at the restaurant in a custom-built 
cold-smoker. 
</P>
<P>
Chef Michel Blanchet starts with whole fresh Norwegian salmon, filets it and 
then dry-cures the fish in a mixture of sea salt and fresh herbs. "When you 
dry-cure salmon, the texture is a lot nicer," he says. "Most salmon is 
brine-cured, and the texture is a little mushier. When you dry-cure, you lose a 
little weight because of the water that comes out, but you gain a lot in 
quality." The salmon is then cold-smoked in a combination of hardwood sawdust, 
bay leaves, rosemary and thyme sprigs. The result ($18 a pound) is one of those 
perfect, simple dishes -- a piece of fish that is as buttery smooth as it is 
flavorful.

RAIN IN A STICK

<TEXT>
<P>
THE GROUND IS PARCHED, but the lush, tropical sound of rain splashing to the 
ground is luxuriously elongated. It stops, it starts, it rushes and then it 
lingers. 
</P>
<P>
An instrument native to South America, the rain stick is the source of this 
water music. Locally, it is the product of instrument maker Gino Zenobia and 
comes in varying sizes: from 3 1/2-foot bamboo stalks to dramatic seven-foot 
lengths ($60 to $125 without exterior adornment; carved and painted, the price 
can run up to $250). "We hammer in inch- to 1 1/2-long pegs," Zenobia explains, 
"then we cap one end and fill it with seashells, rocks and beans. Not 
everything will sound like rain." 
</P>
<P>
Zenobia, a drummer fascinated with African and other ethnic rhythms, started by 
modifying instruments and building those he couldn't find. Today he produces 
about 50 types of percussion instruments, among them the Brazilian berimbau, 
African slit drums, African talking drums and the Australian didjeridu, a long 
tube that makes buzzing, humming sounds -- "a prehistoric, primeval sound," 
Zenobia says.

OUTTAKES: SO THERE!

Raul Julia has a sizable supporting role in "Havana," but you'd never know it 
from the on-screen credits -- his name isn't there. Ditto for Oscar-winning 
actor F. Murray Abraham ("Amadeus"), who opted for anonymity for his work in 
"The Bonfire of the Vanities." 
</P>
<P>
Is modesty sweeping Hollywood? Not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
"Our usual above-the-title credit wasn't available," explains Julia's agent, 
Jeff Hunter, referring to the fact that stars Robert Redford and Lena Olin had 
already secured top billing. "So we decided not to take any credit at all." 
</P>
<P>
Julia, Hunter explains, has become accustomed to elevated billing since his 
star turn in "The Kiss of the Spider Woman." 
</P>
<P>
"Havana" producer-director Sydney Pollack says a dilemma arises when you have 
"an actor on the ascendancy, like Julia, and you ask the actor to do a role 
that's somewhat smaller (than usual)." 
</P>
<P>
With Redford and Olin contractually bound for the only credit over the title, 
and the first credit after the title committed to Alan Arkin, says Pollack, 
"the only billing left for Julia was to be stacked with the rest of the names . 
. . his agent felt that would be a step backward." 
</P>
<P>
In Abraham's case, Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith were the top 
names, with Morgan Freeman firm on the fourth rung. 
</P>
<P>
"The credit they (Warner Bros.) suggested was not suitable," says Abraham's 
agent, Clifford Stevens. "So we decided to take none at all." David J. Fox

Thelonius Monk: Straight, No Chaser (CMAX Sunday at 1 p.m., Wednesday at 10:30 
a.m.) Charlotte Zwerin's 1988 documentary refreshingly breaks the trend of 
downbeat films on jazz artists and has no apparent objective except that of 
presenting an honest, superbly crafted audio-visual portrait that mixes footage 
old and new.

Scrooge (Channel 56 Friday at 9 p.m.) is the delightful 1970 musical version of 
Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" that captures the snow-bright Victorian 
Yuletide celebration of roast goose, mulled wine and urchins caroling. Under 
Ronald Neame's direction Albert Finney brings an agreeable depth to the title 
role.

ON THE RECORD: ASHKENAZY'S MOSTLY MOSCOW SESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the same weekend last year that East Berliners were beginning literally to 
start chipping at the Wall, Vladimir Ashkenazy returned to his native Soviet 
Union for the first time in a quarter-century, along with London's Royal 
Philharmonic Orchestra, of which he is music director. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion, rapturously received by the Moscow public and not at all bad for 
the Soviets' improving image in the West, offered first-class music-making -- 
perhaps Ashkenazy's finest accomplishments to date as a conductor, a calling in 
which he is a relative novice. 
</P>
<P>
The purported bulk of what was heard in the acoustically sumptuous Great Hall 
of the Moscow Conservatory on Nov. 11 and 12, 1989, is preserved on a pair of 
compact discs, issued in this country by MCA Classics (Vol. I, MCAD-6466; Vol. 
II, MCAD-10099). 
</P>
<P>
Listening to the broad-ranging repertory offered here disabuses at least one 
listener of the notion that hiring conductor Ashkenazy is the price one pays 
for getting pianist Ashkenazy. If the Moscow concerts are typical, one is 
fortunate to encounter him in either capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Volume I presents familiar fare: Mussorgsky's "Khovanshchina" Prelude in the 
Rimsky-Korsakov arrangement, a sort of Moscow municipal anthem -- delicately, 
evocatively delivered; the Beethoven Third Piano Concerto directed from the 
keyboard; and the Second "Daphnis et Chloe" Suite by Ravel. 
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy is in characteristically cool, agile form as a Beethoven pianist 
while maintaining keenly balanced rapport with his responsive orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The RPO gives its virtuoso all in the Ravel, disdaining the final measure of 
heat and noise in the pursuit of textural clarity. A wise, winning decision. 
</P>
<P>
The real excitement, however, is in Volume II, an attractive program of 
20th-Century British music, dazzlingly executed. 
</P>
<P>
Three big works are offered, of which Walton's Second Symphony (1960) is 
particularly impressive. Ashkenazy does much to illuminate this undervalued 
score, which in its few previous recorded outings (live hearings are rare even 
in the U.K.) has tended to sound like a near-frantic attempt to recall the 
thrills of the composer's thunderous First Symphony, written a quarter-century 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy, presumably not steeped in Walton's music, brings a fresh, questing 
ear and eye to the later score. Without denying its more bombastic and 
melodramatic elements, he elicits clarity of line (which does not happen by 
itself) throughout and patiently exposes the dynamic subtleties and 
considerable lyric beauties of the slow movement. The orchestral execution is 
on the highest level. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Knussen's Third Symphony (1979) is brawny, snarly, showy, nervously 
fragmented stuff in which thematic ideas tumble out seemingly at will, pushing 
each other aside rather than being developed. The RPO and its enthusiastic 
conductor fully exploit the symphony's built-in wow factor, to the audible 
delight of the Moscow audience. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining work is Britten's Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings -- its 
fourth recording this year -- in an interpretation of extraordinary 
reflectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Martyn Hill's whitish, well-tuned tenor and immaculate diction (in his second 
recorded go at the work this year) are employed to excellent effect and the 
horn solo is executed with stunning aplomb by RPO principal Jeffrey Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while long on sensitivity Ashkenazy's interpretation does not 
consistently maintain momentum, bogging down rather severely in the closing 
portion of the first song and in the whole of the Dirge. 
</P>
<P>
But this didn't happen in Moscow. Reading some small, tucked- away print in 
MCA's notes verifies a listener's suspicions that the Britten -- in a wholly 
different acoustic, at a lower volume level and with no audience noise -- is a 
studio job. It was recorded, as it turns out, at Abbey Road three months after 
the Moscow concerts.

They've done it again. On a televised parade, a band is introduced, then cut 
for commercials, chit-chat, small-talk or fill-in talk (by the announcers). 
</P>
<P>
There are those of us who love the bands, majorettes and drill teams -- who 
feel these units make a parade. 
</P>

Come on -- don't discriminate against the marching band units. It's too late 
now for this year's Hollywood Christmas Parade (Channel 5 Nov. 25) -- but let's 
see more of those music makers in the Tournament of Roses Parade.

BETWEEN THE COVERS: FROM THE OBSCURE TO THE POPULAR

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER, Leonard Feather is The Times' jazz critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past months, several jazz-related books have reached the stores, some of 
which are worth keeping in mind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JAZZ SINGING By Will Friedwald (Scribners: $29.95; 477 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Friedwald, at 29, is young enough to have total dogmatic belief in his every 
statement. Highly opinionated and not always accurate (he credits Fats Waller's 
song "Black and Blue" to Eubie Blake), "Jazz Singing" could more accurately 
have been titled "Jazz and Pop Singing," since many pages are devoted to 
obscure pop figures such as Al Bowlly and Cliff (Ukulele Ike) Edwards, along 
with Doris Day and Dick Haymes. 
</P>
<P>
Friedwald later rambles on at length about Betty Carter and Mark Murphy, but 
dismisses Helen Merrill in one line, then consigns Cleo Laine and the Manhattan 
Transfer to the dust heap. Irreverent and iconoclastic, Friedwald nevertheless 
is readable, informative and witty. You may even enjoy indulging in mental 
arguments with him and will wish you could reply to some of his more outrageous 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REMINISCING IN TEMPO By Teddy Reig (Scarecrow: $29.50; 204 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Subtitled "The Life and Times of a Jazz Hustler," the story of Reig (1918-1984) 
was fleshed out after his death by Ed Berger and by friends who recall him with 
affection. A fringe character, almost literally larger than life at 350 pounds, 
Reig went to jail in 1942 for possession of marijuana (a big scandal in those 
days). Later he became a close friend of jazzmen, producing records with Basie, 
Bird, Belafonte and others. With its nostalgic recollections, mostly of Harlem, 
this is a useful social document marred by its brevity and its omissions. For 
example, Reig worked with Birdland owner Morris Levy, whose organized crime 
connections, detailed in the recent book "Hit Men," are ignored here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DRUMMIN' MEN By Burt Korall (Macmillan: $24.95; 381 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The author, briefly a drummer himself, informatively examines what he calls 
"The Heartbeat of Jazz (in) The Swing Years," with affection. Seven drummers 
are spotlighted: Chick Webb, Gene Krupa, Ray McKinley (the only one still 
alive), Jo Jones, Sid Catlett, the greatly underrated Dave Tough, and Buddy 
Rich. Seven others are dealt with briefly. Korall enlivens his essays with 
plenty of quotes from admirers of his subjects. This will appeal not only to 
drummers but to anyone interested in the social and musical overtones of the 
role played by percussionists in jazz. Drummer Mel Torme's foreword is 
delightful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
POETS OF TIN PAN ALLEY By Philip Furia (Oxford: $22.95; 322 pages) 
</P>
<P>
What Alec Wilder did for melodies in his classic "American Popular Song" (see 
below), Furia now does for the lyricists. It is odd that a work so 
microscopically analytical of Berlin, Porter, Ira Gershwin, Lorenz Hart and the 
rest should be unaware (like Friedwald) of the difference between who and whom, 
yet Furia is on firm ground most of the way. The balance between historical 
detail and examinations of specific songs is well maintained, resulting in a 
volume that devotes, for example, 20 valuable pages to Johnny Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that Furia chose to segregate what he calls "jazz lyricists" 
into a separate chapter (there is no such animal). He all but ignores the 
magnificent work by Andy Razaf ("Honeysuckle Rose," "Ain't Misbehavin' ") while 
crediting Irving Mills -- a manager and publisher (mainly associated with Duke 
Ellington) who was never seriously regarded as a songwriter -- with lyrics to 
which Mills himself probably would not lay claim (he employed many 
collaborators). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INSIDE PAUL HORN By Paul Horn with Lee Underwood (Harper Collins: $19.95; 284 
pages) 
</P>
<P>
Well known in the 1960s as a Los Angeles based sax-and-flute soloist, Horn 
wrote the first jazz mass, then became involved in a spiritual odyssey and was 
a student of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He ultimately opted for a life of 
serenity and seclusion, though he still travels the world from his home in 
Victoria, B.C., where he's been based since 1970. Though the second half of the 
book is concerned with Horn's travels rather than with music, the story, 
reflecting his evolution as a global thinker and his sensitive self-awareness, 
is of absorbing interest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN SINGERS By Whitney Balliett (Oxford: $9.95; 244 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Written between 1970 and 1984, these 27 essays exemplify the insightful grace 
of Balliett's prose. Though some of the singers are obscure (Hugh Shannon, Mary 
Mayo) and one deals with a pianist who rarely sings (George Shearing), each 
piece justifies itself as a stylistic gem. Regrettably, no dates are given, and 
several deceased subjects (Helen Humes, Alberta Hunter) are discussed in the 
present tense. At its paperback price, this is an essential purchase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FROM BLUES TO BOP By Various writers (Louisiana State U. Press: $24.95; 295 
pages) 
</P>
<P>
This is, perhaps inevitably because of the sporadic use of jazz as a subject 
for fiction, a highly uneven collection. Edited by Richard Albert, it includes 
a few valuable pieces: Langston Hughes' "Dance," James Baldwin's "Sonny's 
Blues," and an evocative work by Josef Skvorcky, best known for "The Brass 
Saxophone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Brief: 
</P>
<P>
"American Popular Song" by Alec Wilder, $29.95, 536 pages, now with a foreword 
by Gene Lees, has been reissued by Oxford and remains the definitive work on 
the great innovators from 1900 to 1950 . . . "As Thousands Cheer," by Laurence 
Bergreen, $24.95, 658 pages) is the well-researched (with no help from the 
subject) biography of Irving Berlin, who detested jazz but many of whose songs 
became jazz standards . . . "Meet Me at Jim and Andy's," by Gene Lees (Oxford, 
$8.95, 265 pages) is a paperback reprint of 13 brilliant essays by Gene Lees, 
culled from his monthly Jazzletter.

RECORD RACK: THE BOX SET: *** 1/2 VARIOUS ARTISTS "THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE 
SHOW -- 15TH ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION" ODE/RHINO

<P>
Richard O'Brien's kitschy, sci-fi/glam-rock "Rocky Horror Show" stands as not 
only the best rock musical ever written, but probably the last very good one. 
Besides his rare gift for writing actual rock songs for the stage, O'Brien's 
genius was in depicting the sexual revolution literally as an alien invasion, 
and it was a funny, brilliant metaphor for moral upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
Such symbolism is pretty much lost on most of the toast-tossing, corset-clad 
cultists who see the film as an excuse for romper-room midnight-movie 
decadence. Their folly doesn't diminish O'Brien's original achievement, the 
nearly 20 songs of which are well-documented (spread over four CDs, a little 
too well-documented) in this overly exhaustive box set. 
</P>
<P>
The 1975 film score is the one essential disc therein, an improvement over the 
earlier Roxy cast recording also included. The other two CDs consist of 
rarities, foreign-language versions, additional recordings by cast members and 
tracks from the mediocre sequel, "Shock Treatment." It's nice to finally have 
several excellent numbers that were cut from the movie's soundtrack, but the 
long-awaited "Sword of Damocles," for one, sounds as if it was mastered from a 
second-generation videotape. Did some of the master tapes get caught in a time 
warp? CHRIS WILLMAN

SPARE NO EXPENSE: The $10.98 tape is here to stay. In recent months George 
Michael, the Traveling Wilburys, Whitney Houston, Bell Biv Devoe and Jon Bon 
Jovi have put out $10.98 list-priced releases -- and you can bet there's more 
to come from major artists next year. 
</P>
<P>
(Meanwhile, Madonna's "Immaculate" hits collection is going for a steep $13.98, 
despite the presence of only one new song!) . . . And we knew that Was (Not 
Was) co-leader Don Was has been producing plenty of top popsters -- from Bob 
Dylan and Iggy Pop to Bonnie Raitt and Elton John. But now he's really boxing 
the compass. Was has been in the studio with Paula Abdul, producing two songs 
(one written by the Was Bros. with Bob Dylan) while also finishing up a new 
Leonard Cohen album -- and preparing a follow-up Bonnie Raitt project. Who's 
next? We hear Was has signed on to produce the new Mick Jagger solo album.

TICKET TO RIDE: Michael Jackson -- and his close adviser, David Geffen -- are 
on the move again. Although no one's talking on the record, several inside 
sources say that Jackson/Geffen are in the process of finding a new home for 
Jackson's mega-million ATV Music publishing company. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, which owns a wealth of valuable catalogues, most notably the Beatles' 
hits, has been administered by EMI Music, one of the industry's largest 
publishing firms. But Jackson and Geffen (who sold his record company to MCA 
Inc. earlier this year) are in negotiations with MCA Music, despite the fact 
that MCA has a much smaller worldwide publishing network. The deal could mean 
an additional $1 million annually in revenue for MCA -- and a big boost in 
prestige. (Most music publishers get 15% to 20% of the profits in an 
administration deal, though MCA will get a considerably smaller percentage 
because of Jackson's superstar status.) However, the news isn't all bad for 
EMI. It may be losing the Gloved One, but it's winning the battle to land Rod 
Stewart's much-coveted publishing catalogue, which had been at Warner-Chappell 
Music.

ON THE TIP: The "Explicit Lyrics" sticker has become such a popular 
record-industry marketing tool that it's practically impossible to walk into a 
record store without seeing a stack of CDs stamped accordingly. So it was only 
a matter of time before a shrewd rap artist (or his record company) decided -- 
why bother with a sticker when we can just make it the title of our album? 
Which is why Virgin Records' has just released a new rap album called "Barsha's 
Explicit Lyrics." 
</P>
<P>
(Trust us -- we've heard the lyrics and Barsha isn't exaggerating.) . . . Our 
fave oddball novelty holiday compilation is from I.R.S. Records. Titled "Just 
in Time for Christmas," it features Squeeze's "Christmas Day," Wall of Voodoo's 
"Shouldn't Have Given Him a Gun for Christmas," the dB's' "Home for the 
Holidays" and Dread Zeppelin's "All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front 
Teeth," which the band concludes by segueing into "Viva Las Vegas." . . . And 
contrary to what we reported last week, Profile Records is no longer 
distributed by California Record Distributors. Profile co-owner Steve Plotnicki 
says that the label severed its ties with CRD in mid-September and is now 
handled by Landmark Distributors, a Profile-owned distribution company.

POP EYE: IS ROCK 'N' ROLL ON ITS LAST LEGS? OR JUST IN A SLUMP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Guess what's practically disappeared from the Billboard Top 10 this week? 
Here's a hint: Something that is such an elemental ingredient in the pop 
experience that you never imagined it could disappear. 
</P>
<P>
Would you believe . . . rock 'n' roll? 
</P>
<P>
With AC/DC's "The Razor's Edge" at No. 9 this week, there's only one rock album 
in the Top 10. In fact, it's been nearly 14 months since a rock group topped 
the Billboard charts (when Motley Crue spent two weeks at No. 1 in October, 
1989). 
</P>
<P>
Look at it this way: In 1988, five rock groups had No. 1 albums (U2, Guns N' 
Roses, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi and Van Halen). In 1989, it was just two (the Crue 
and the Fine Young Cannibals). In 1990: zero. 
</P>
<P>
What worries record industry execs even more is that Contemporary Hit Radio 
(CHR), radio's key hitmaking format, has been ignoring rock too, focusing on 
dance, rap and pop hits. (Just look at Radio &amp; Records' CHR chart, which 
has only six bona-fide rock singles in the Top 35.) 
</P>
<P>
Is rock simply in a slump? Has MTV ruined rock 'n' roll? Are rap stars like 
Vanilla Ice and M.C. Hammer stealing away young fans? Or is putting together a 
garage-rock group no longer a big part of the adolescent American dream? We 
asked some industry experts for answers. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Pfeiffer, A&amp;R exec at Epic Records: "The fundamental problem is that in 
recent years liquor laws have changed and forced rock clubs to restrict 
admissions to fans 21 and over. So club scenes are dead everywhere. That's hurt 
young bands because it took away a big economic base of support. But more 
importantly, the root experience of rock 'n' roll -- the excitement of turning 
18 and going to see a live rock band -- is over. If you're 19 now, you're 
either going to movies or watching MTV. By the time you're 21, that combination 
of sex, drinking and rock 'n' roll isn't so vital anymore. Live rock just isn't 
such an integral part of kids lives." 
</P>
<P>
Hale Milgrim, president of Capitol Records: "There's no doubt that middle 
America really got into rap music for the first time this year. When CHR 
responded by playing a lot of it, it became a lot harder to find a new rock 
band on the radio. Does that mean rock is dead? I don't think so. Maybe it 
won't be as important to today's kids as it was to the generation that grew up 
in the '60s. But I think it's just going through another evolutionary phase. 
Growth isn't unhealthy, even if it isn't all positive. Who would want rock to 
just stay the same?" 
</P>
<P>
Bud Scoppa, vice president of artist development at Zoo Records: "You 
definitely get the feeling that the field of play has diminished. With radio 
looking elsewhere, there aren't many viable avenues of exposure for rock music. 
The video monster has taken up so much of our revenue as an industry -- and 
attracted so much attention from consumers -- that rock bands are aiming for 
MTV stardom now. They're not out playing in smoky dives every night. And the 
ones you do see, especially out here, aren't playing for the love of music. 
They're trying to tailor their performances to get a record deal." 
</P>
<P>
Carey Curelop, program director at KLOS-FM: "We're at a fork in the road with 
CHR radio. The recent ratings show that people are burned out by the steady 
diet of dance and rap hits. In the fall of 1989, Power 106 had a 6.2 share of 
audience. This summer they fell to a 4.3. KIIS-FM was at 5.4 last fall. Now 
they're at 4.9. There's been a similar downtrend across the country. I think 
you're going to see radio broaden its playlists and make room for 
guitar-oriented bands like the Black Crowes and Slaughter." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Rosenblatt, president of Geffen Records: "Lack of support from CHR radio is 
definitely a big factor -- it's totally turned its back on rock. We've sold a 
million copies of our Black Crowes album with minimal CHR play. But there just 
haven't been that many rock records in the marketplace. Look who hasn't put out 
a record this year -- Guns N' Roses, Def Leppard, U2, Bruce Springsteen, 
Aerosmith, Van Halen and a ton of other bands. Wait till next year."

Robert Hilburn's "20 Bands That Matter" (Dec. 2) was a brave attempt at the 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
However, I feel one band in particular was served a major injustice by its 
exclusion: the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Faith No More are the new media darlings, 
and on their own are a powerful band, but anyone familiar with the 'Peppers' 
knows they are the true innovators of this style of music. 
</P>
<P>
I feel the R.H.C.P., who have taken so many chances musically over such a long 
period of time bringing together diverse musical influences were insulted by 
the inclusion of a band that blatantly rips them off.

THE NEW LEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
Does Norman Lear believe he can absolve his guilt for producing "All in the 
Family," which was the beginning of the sleaze on TV, by his new show that 
could be called "Look Who's Coming to Sunday Dinner"? 
</P>
<P>
It isn't possible that bigoted (lovable?) Archie Bunker ever caused anyone to 
look at their prejudices. It only excused their own hatreds. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that also is the reason Carroll O'Connor is doing "In the Heat of the 
Night" -- guilt. Why Jean Stapleton allowed her character to be subjected to 
such ridicule is not understandable.

So Norman Lear has decided to do his own brand of evangelism ("Divining the New

<P>
We're all waiting to see whose "god" Lear will choose to ridicule. I think we 
Bible-believing Christians have a good idea which one it will be.

THE NEW LEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As it pertains to your article on Norman Lear, he is not a "political maven," 
which in Yiddish or Hebrew means an expert. Lear is a political maverick, a 
nonconformist. 
</P>
<P>
As to the merits of what Lear "begat," if it gave him 10 acres and a 
12,300-square-foot home, even without the mule, it is an unequivocal proof of 
his success. 
</P>
<P>
However, in his quest, at 68, for the meaning of life, he won't find the 
answer, nor happiness, in a palatial dwelling. Marie Antoinette tried it in 
Versailles, and you know how that story ended. For the holidays I wish Lear 
wisdom; that is the most valuable, but also the most elusive, of life's gifts. 
At the end if we take enough of it with us we are guaranteed a long and 
pleasant sleep, and wonderful dreams.

<TEXT>
<P>
I really enjoyed Robert Hilburn's article, but I felt that I had to set the 
record straight about his comments on Living Colour. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the fact that they should have been listed in the top five, I disagreed 
with his suggestion that Vernon Reid is the only saving element of the band. 
</P>
<P>
Although I agree that Reid's songwriting and musicianship is excellent, it is 
only the combination of this with the other three elements of Living Colour 
that makes them one of the best of the new groups. 
</P>
<P>
When he quoted some "sample lines" of Vernon Reid's songwriting, he was 
actually quoting drummer William Calhoun's song, "Pride," which shows his 
strong songwriting skills. I must add, as a drummer myself, that William 
Calhoun is one of the most talented of the new drummers. Also, the exceptional 
bass playing of Muzz Skillings is an indispensable part of the band and can't 
be ignored.

AS DEMOCRACY APPEARS, RANKS OF WOMEN DROP IN HALLS OF GOVERNMENT; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERN EUROPE: THE FEMALES IN THE COMMUNIST REGIMES WERE MOSTLY SHOWPIECES. 
THERE ARE STRONG FORCES HOLDING THEM BACK.

<P>
Ranks of women members were a showpiece in the sham parliaments of Communist 
regimes. Then democracy came to Eastern Europe, and most of the women were 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
A survey by the Inter-Parliamentary Council in Geneva found that all 
parliaments in the former Soviet Bloc have fewer women members than before 
Communist parties fell from power last year. 
</P>
<P>
The sharpest decline was in Romania, where women made up 34% of dictator 
Nicolae Ceausescu's rubber-stamp assembly. After the May elections, only 4% of 
the legislators are women. 
</P>
<P>
"While, under Ceausescu, there were quotas for skirts in the parliament . . . 
that didn't reflect political reality," said Cristina Popescu, a feminist and 
editor of the newspaper Romania Libera. "Now, what you see is what you've got." 
</P>
<P>
New issues may galvanize women -- Poland is on the verge of outlawing abortion, 
legal since 1956 -- but there is virtually no tradition of real power for them 
in either the Communist system or the former opposition movements. 
</P>
<P>
Strong forces are holding women back. 
</P>
<P>
To them falls most of the exhausting daily grind of finding a family's food, 
clothing and small pleasures in shortage-plagued economies. 
</P>
<P>
Social custom causes women to marry early, have children immediately and dote 
on them. The Roman Catholic Church, predominant in Poland and strong elsewhere, 
encourages a traditional family model and has considerable political influence. 
</P>
<P>
Women have virtually no organizations they can use as a basis for political 
power. 
</P>
<P>
The search for equality on which Western women, men and institutions embarked 
25 years ago found no mirror in the Communist world. 
</P>
<P>
Communist leaders often dismissed "women's lib" as a foible of indulged, 
immoral capitalists. Opposition groups did not welcome women to their 
leaderships or pursue women's issues in the battle against communism. 
</P>
<P>
Little sensitivity to women's equality is evident in the new democracies. 
</P>
<P>
Government commissions and public forums usually are men-only, and assumptions 
about women are rampant. A Western diplomat recalls repeatedly explaining that 
she was not making an error in Polish when she identified herself as a 
secretarz of her embassy, not a secretarka on the clerical staff. 
</P>
<P>
Those few women in the East who would call themselves feminists are only 
beginning to look at the way schoolbooks stereotype male and female roles. 
Suggestions that advertisements seeking Western investors should be addressed 
to "executives" and not "businessmen" are greeted with blank stares. 
</P>
<P>
"The word feminist was ridiculed, the media made fun of Western women and I 
didn't believe there were other women who believed as I did," said Hanna 
Jankowska, who helped found Poland's fledgling ProFemina group after meeting 
like-minded women at a small rally against the anti-abortion law. 
</P>
<P>
Jankowska and others blame the fake equality of the Communist system. Now that 
it has crumbled, women are likely to retreat rather than jump at new 
possibilities, they predict. 
</P>
<P>
"Women did not fight for emancipation; it was given to them with the new 
socialist system," she said. "Many people connect the two. 
</P>
<P>
"For many women, the practical effect of this emancipation is they have to go 
to work. They have two shifts -- at work and then for the home. They are very 
tired and would prefer to stay home." 
</P>
<P>
After Bulgaria's elections in June, women made up 3.5% of the parliament, down 
from 21%. The Hungarian parliament is 7% female, down from 21% before free 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's parliament, chosen partly by democratic elections, is 12% women, 
compared to 20% when the Communist Party picked all candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in most of the post-Communist countries is more or less the 
same," said Izabela Nowacka of the Polish League of Women, a Communist-aligned 
organization now seeking an independent identity. 
</P>
<P>
"A certain number of seats were allotted to women in Parliament and it was due 
to this (Communist) system that women were allowed to enter government 
institutions, but not the women who had something to say." 
</P>
<P>
The Communists also had quotas for farmers, steelworkers and miners. Their 
elimination in Poland also reduced working-class participation in Parliament, 
where 83% of members now have university educations, compared with 60% 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
No women have positions of power in Solidarity, which was born in 1980 during a 
Gdansk shipyard strike that started over the firing of a female crane operator. 
Even in the textile center of Lodz, where the vast majority of mill workers are 
women, Solidarity always has been led by men. 
</P>
<P>
When Solidarity was banned in 1981 and thousands of members were interned under 
martial law, women played important, but supporting, roles. 
</P>
<P>
They helped activist husbands, made placards and distributed literature. Their 
highest representation was in the underground press, where many wrote under 
male pseudonyms. 
</P>
<P>
Only two women were among the 57 participants in talks between Solidarity and 
the Communists that laid the groundwork for the transfer of power in 1989. Just 
one woman minister, in charge of culture, serves in the new government. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-abortion campaign, a product of Solidarity's close alignment with the 
church, conservative nationalism and all things anti-Communist, has roused some 
women. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in postwar Poland, women became aware that their rights are 
in danger," Jankowska said. "We are at the very beginning of organizing women 
in this country. It is a difficult task, but this abortion issue has awakened 
women." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, however, there is little optimism for substantially increased 
involvement or professional advancement by this generation of women in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Winners of Polish parliament seats "were very much connected with the church 
and the traditional model of family," said Dr. Zofia Kuratowska, deputy senate 
speaker and one of the few ranking women in Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
She said the spring elections probably will produce an even more conservative 
assembly after a battle among fledgling parties in which women have little 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Kuratowska noted that women made up only about 10% of candidates in the May 
local elections. Municipal contests often are a starting point for political 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
Worn down by work, shopping and child care, women appear likely to succumb to 
the widespread Eastern European attitude that the authorities will do whatever 
they want in the end. 
</P>
<P>
Activists say many women already have retreated into their private lives, 
tuning out the political system.

MEXICO'S BAGDAD ONCE CLASHED WITH U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN RICE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BAGDAD, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was once another Bagdad, along another oil-rich gulf, facing U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
It was a boom-town border port at the mouth of the Rio Grande, a city of 10,000 
that thrived by exporting Confederate tobacco and cotton, evading the Union 
blockade of Southern ports. 
</P>
<P>
In 1866, after the Civil War, Mexican officials were fighting for control of 
the town and one faction invited 1,000 American soldiers from the other side of 
the river to help. 
</P>
<P>
But the soldiers stayed for 20 days of looting -- a debacle that got their 
commander imprisoned when he returned to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The sack was so total, it was as if Bagdad had been taken from one side of the 
river to the other," says Mexico's Porrua Encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi capital, Baghdad, also has suffered its share of sacks: The Mongols 
raped and pillaged in 1258, Tamerlane's followers repeated in 1400, and the 
Persians did the same in 1524. 
</P>
<P>
Like those attacks, the sack of Bagdad, Mexico, failed to crush the town. It 
took a hurricane in 1880 and changing trade patterns to do that. 
</P>
<P>
There is not much on either side of the river today: a wind-blasted vista of 
shoe-high scrub; dry lakes, damp lakes and marshes; a few fishermen's shacks 
and a few stands of trees, each visible for miles. 
</P>
<P>
The only U.S. force in evidence is the Border Patrol, which runs an occasional 
launch up the river, according to Ismael Perez, a fisherman who has lived in 
what was Bagdad for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, who had wandered over with Silberio Duenas to help a stranger push his 
car out of a small bog, said he sometimes found old bottles, coins or a few old 
building stones in the area. 
</P>
<P>
But no monuments, not even any eroded walls, bear witness to the 
not-quite-splendor that was Bagdad. 
</P>
<P>
Why the place was named for the great Arab capital "is a mystery nobody has 
been able to solve," said Matamoros historian Andres Cuellar. "It's extremely 
odd." 
</P>
<P>
He said one theory is that one of Bagdad's founders was inspired by "The 
Arabian Nights," which tells the story of an Arab sailor named Sinbad who sets 
out on adventures from Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Even in its heyday, Bagdad lacked the golden domes and tiled spires of the 
Iraqi capital's mosques, the twisting alleyways of mud brick houses, the brutal 
Ottoman intrigue of its politics. To say nothing of any Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
Both are deadly flat, save for a few sand dunes in the Mexican town. Both are 
graced by a river, although the Rio Grande resembles the puny Jordan River more 
than Baghdad's mighty Tigris. 
</P>
<P>
Cuellar said Bagdad was born when the authorities sought to stop goods from 
disappearing between the ships offshore and the customs house in Matamoros, 20 
miles inland. They decided to put the tax collector where the imports met the 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some people in Matamoros go blank when asked about the city that once 
rivaled their own as a center of northern trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say there was a Bagdad, but it's now under the waters of the sea," 
said a soda pop vendor in downtown Matamoros, when asked for directions to the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
For Perez and his fellow fishermen here, the conflict in the Persian Gulf seems 
just as remote. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the other Baghdad, he at first speculated on a city in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a radio here," he said. "There is nothing here but air."

EX-GUNMAN FOR IRA FINDS PEACE OF MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

DUBLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Lenaghan was a teen-age gunman in an IRA assassination squad. Today, he 
teaches religion. 
</P>
<P>
"You had only one job -- to execute," he says of his role in the Irish 
Republican Army's campaign to force Britain out of Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from leading an IRA "punishment squad" that shot its victims in 
the kneecaps to being a highly trained member of an "active service unit" that 
went out to kill policemen and British soldiers on the streets of Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
"There was exaltation as well as fear when you held the gun. A buzz. A hype," 
Lenaghan confessed. 
</P>
<P>
There was no self-doubt then. 
</P>
<P>
"All I thought was: Get the job done. Do it right. Make sure it is done well," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no remorse. You couldn't have done it if you had emotional 
hang-ups," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The gunman is a victim of his time. You have to be warped or distorted." 
</P>
<P>
Lenaghan says his family was forced out of its Belfast home by Protestant gangs 
and that one of his schoolteachers was accidentally shot dead by British 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Steeped in the sectarian hatred that divides this island, he never wavered 
during his 15 years fighting for the IRA, which seeks to oust the British from 
the north and reunify Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"Then on Feb. 15, 1982, we went to shoot two soldiers in the Falls Road (in 
Republican West Belfast)," he recalls. "Instead we hit a civilian in the street 
by mistake. I was arrested with a rifle." 
</P>
<P>
He was given a 12-year sentence and sent to the top security Maze Prison, home 
to 400 Republican and Protestant prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
There he met a Roman Catholic priest, Father Patrick Kelly, who came to speak 
to the inmates about the Marian shrine at Medjugorje, Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
"After 15 years rooted in violence, tit-for-tat, eye-for-an-eye, I began to be 
aware of the mask of self-deception I was wearing," Lenaghan said. "Faith gave 
me the way to life." 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed in a Dublin restaurant, he lowers his voice when he realizes that 
others are listening to his vivid tale of those bloody IRA days and his 
decision to turn his back on violence. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on his conversion in prison, he said: "I had no peace of mind. 
Aggression had been my constant stimulus. I began to question my motives and 
what I was doing in the IRA. I was a closet Christian terrified of losing my 
image." 
</P>
<P>
Turning his back on the IRA was not easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It is rarely done. They don't stop you but the barriers are huge. It is like a 
marriage contract. My decision brought me a lot of flak, anger, resentment and 
abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Lenaghan was released after serving six years of his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to find a role. I knew I could harness the desert of my experience 
for other people. It was like a flower growing in that desert." 
</P>
<P>
He worked with youth groups in West Belfast, then did two years with a Catholic 
missionary order in Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
Now 30, he is studying at Maynooth Religious College and teaching religion at a 
Dublin high school. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he wants to be a priest, he said: "My niche is out and about in 
the world. You have to grow where you are planted." 
</P>
<P>
His life came full circle when he visited the Medjugorje shrine and met a 
British soldier who had patrolled the Belfast streets Lenaghan once roamed as 
an IRA gunman. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no sense of animosity. We were both touched by a sense of peace," he 
said.

MADISON, WIS., ACTS TO WIPE TARNISH OFF LIBERAL IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EGGLESTON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MADISON, Wis. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The daily dose of government debate at the state Capitol and the shuffle of 
students between university classes can't muffle the question. 
</P>
<P>
Is Madison's long, proud tradition of liberal politics, student activism and 
tolerance of widely divergent groups and views in jeopardy? 
</P>
<P>
That is the question that lobbyist Ken Opin's mother, who lives on the East 
Coast, asked him after reading news accounts about a rash of anti-Semitic 
vandalism in Madison this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts also asked after U.S. Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, a Democrat 
and champion of liberal causes, was ousted by a conservative after 32 years in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
And it's the question aldermen asked after a Southeast Asian woman collecting 
aluminum cans to supplement her welfare income was arrested under Madison's 
trash-recycling law. 
</P>
<P>
Has this city of 180,000 changed? 
</P>
<P>
"The world has changed," said Mayor Paul R. Soglin, a Vietnam War protester 
whose political views and garb earned him the nickname "hippie mayor" during 
his first term in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years in the private sector, Soglin returned to office two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He has traded his beads, tie-dyed shirts and ponchos for tweeds and striped 
ties. And he doesn't march past the Capitol with a throng of students to lobby 
for the latest cause in social justice. He strolls downtown and courts business 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Madison is no longer the Emerald City," said Orlando Bell, president of the 
local chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. "It 
has big-city problems, and it is going to have to find big-city solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Madison's enthrallment with its proud liberal past allowed problems to go 
mostly unnoticed during the late 1970s and 1980s, Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
"During the time we were in suspended animation, these problems have been 
knocking on our door," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The deepest blow to the city's image this year was in the form of anti-Semitic 
vandalism. In one incident, brake lines were cut on a bus carrying children 
from a Jewish camp, and tragedy was narrowly averted. Police have guarded 
temples and synagogues during recent Jewish holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"Anti-Semitism had finally hit home," said the Rev. Frederick Trost, president 
of the Wisconsin Conference of the United Church of Christ. "People were 
astonished and shocked by it." 
</P>
<P>
Added Mary Rouse, dean of students at the University of Wisconsin: "It was a 
very painful reminder that discrimination occurs in every community." 
</P>
<P>
Added to that: 
</P>
<P>
* The Nov. 6 ouster of Kastenmeier, whose incessant pursuit of civil rights, 
nuclear disarmament and openness in government became a symbol of the political 
climate here during the 1960s and 1970s. Both Democrats and Republicans say 
that political newcomer Scott Klug capitalized on dissatisfaction with Congress 
in general. 
</P>
<P>
* The aluminum-can gleaner's arrest under an anti-scavenging ordinance passed 
by the City Council. The charge was dropped in September, after one alderman 
declared during a council meeting that his colleagues had become more 
interested in giving tax breaks to rich companies than in protecting the 
interests of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
* The attack on two white youths by black youths in September. Also, in 
November, a gang of about 20 young men and women attacked and robbed three 
people outside a tavern. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of downplaying such incidents, city leaders condemned them as threats 
to the prevailing ideology and discussed potential solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Clergy joined to assist the Jewish community and allay fears with impassioned 
sermons and sharply worded editorials. 
</P>
<P>
The university instituted mandatory classes in race relations. 
</P>
<P>
"The outpouring of community response has been decisive and overwhelming," 
state Rep. David Clarenbach said. "Law enforcement, the religious community, 
minorities have spoken with one voice." 
</P>
<P>
Opin, the lobbyist, said the incidents did not surprise him as much as the 
reactions to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been Jewish a long time, and I've encountered a lot of anti-Semitism," he 
said. "I don't think Madison is any different in its degree of anti-Semitism. . 
. . What's primarily different is the community's response." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, city leaders wonder if they have done enough. The NAACP is organizing 
a coalition of activists, similar to the one formed in Madison in the 1960s, to 
advance the causes of peace, civil rights, feminism and gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
The university, with its 45,000-student body, is seeking to devote more of its 
resources to community problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to renew our commitment to civil rights and human rights every day," 
Rouse said. "People of all walks of life have come together. To the extent that 
you can take something that is ugly and painful and make it positive, we've 
done a great deal."

PHONE SERVICES ALLOW YOU TO DIAL-A-LIFE

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Need a new mattress, but don't feel like getting out of bed? Slumber comfort is 
just a phone call away -- as are dream dates, decorators, teachers and 
T-shirts, all via the city's assorted Dial-A lines. 
</P>
<P>
Dial-A-Floor. Dial-A-Chef. Dial-A-Hearing Test. In New York, where time is 
always tight, you can get everything from soup to nuts -- and a redecorated 
kitchen to eat them in -- with nothing more than a touch-tone phone. 
</P>
<P>
"You can call us from your office, from your home, from your car -- doesn't 
matter. And within two hours, we can deliver you a mattress," said Joe Vicens, 
vice president of sales and marketing at Dial-A-Mattress. 
</P>
<P>
"We get close to 1,000 calls a day," he said. "On a top day, we get 1,500 
calls." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always so. For seven years, Vicens answered the phones alone. But 
times have changed; there are more two-job families, less time to shop. And 
it's so easy to punch in 1-800-MATTRES (nobody said spelling was a requirement 
for sales). 
</P>
<P>
Dial-A-Mattress was born 12 years ago when a small furniture company owner, 
Napoleon Barrigan, spotted a "dial-a-steak promotion in one of the papers," 
Vicens recalled. "This gave him the idea for Dial-A-Mattress. Surprisingly, a 
lot of people started calling." 
</P>
<P>
The steak idea is still hot. Dial-A-Chef will dispatch a genuine, trained cook 
to your residence to prepare the repast of your choice. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a catering service. If you're planning a dinner party, you call us 
up. We send over a chef who prepares an entire meal right in your home," said 
manager Charles Dean, whose company opened last year. 
</P>
<P>
He has about two dozen chefs, who handle everything from vegetarian delights to 
fine French cuisine. The chefs get $20 to $50 an hour; they work a minimum of 
four hours, and raw materials cost extra, Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
Since man does not live by bed alone -- or by pheasant under glass -- there are 
Dial-A-Prayer and Dial-An-Atheist. 
</P>
<P>
"I give thanks, O God, that because I believe in thee, I can be positive about 
life. . . . Remove the fears from my heart, I pray, for fears draw negative 
feelings. Prune my thoughts of defeat," intoned a recent Dial-A-Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Thus inspired, it's on to the secular, like Dial-A-Hearing Test. There was no 
answer there, leading a caller to believe it apparently works this way: If you 
can hear the phone ringing, your ears are OK. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously in demand: secretaries. There are three Dial-A-Secretary numbers for 
people seeking temporary office assistance, a figure outdone only by Penthouse 
magazine's risque Dial-A-Forum Letter and its five exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Manhattan offers 40 Dial-A services -- uh, make that 39. Out of 
business: Dial-A-Dentist. "I'm sure you've got the wrong number. This is a shoe 
store," advised the worker answering the phone at the line once used for dental 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
The services are not only for adults. Students stumped by homework can 
Dial-A-Teacher from Monday through Thursday, 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Instructors take 
phone calls and provide instant assistance in both English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
People looking to get dressed but not dressed up can ring Dial-A-T-Shirt, where 
custom print jobs are a specialty. These guys will put anything you want on a 
hat, T-shirt or sweat shirt, said manager Dean Artenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, people still must come down to the store to pick up their 
orders, although Artenberg said he can understand why they would rather do 
their business by phone only. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting to where you go out on the street around here, you might not ever 
be coming back," he observed.

It looks like any other school -- teachers striding from class to class 
clutching armfuls of papers, a packed schoolyard, art projects pinned to the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
But the European School, in one of Brussels' affluent suburbs, is part of a 
unique experiment in education that has endured for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than a national curriculum, there is a European one. Children learn 
history, geography and economics in a foreign language, taught by teachers from 
all 12 European Community states. When they graduate at about age 18, many 
students are proficient in three or four languages. 
</P>
<P>
"The school develops a great awareness of what it is to be European, far more 
so among the children than among their parents," headmaster John Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
His school is one of nine set up by the European Community to provide free 
education for the sons and daughters of its officials. 
</P>
<P>
Are they showing the way as the European Community moves toward economic -- and 
perhaps eventually political -- union? 
</P>
<P>
Or are the academically rigorous schools simply breeding a new elite, a 
generation of Eurocrats with a permanent advantage over contemporaries educated 
more conventionally? 
</P>
<P>
"You may tell me it's elitist," said Marshall, a 52-year-old former French 
teacher and school inspector in Britain. "But it's designed for able children 
and there is an enormous cross-pollination of cultures." 
</P>
<P>
Three of the nine EC schools are in Belgium; Marshall's, with almost 3,400 
pupils, is the biggest. Started in 1958, it is funded by the Community and its 
12 national governments. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students' parents are EC officials, although fee-paying children of 
diplomats or business executives are admitted. Brussels, headquarters for NATO 
and the EC, is packed with people who want their children taught at the 
European School, not least because it is cheaper than the many other 
international schools here. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall concedes that many of his pupils come from privileged backgrounds, 
with experience of travel and different cultures through their parents' jobs. 
Many already speak at least one foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers, some of whom send their own children here, are not eager to go 
home when their government-sponsored contracts run out. "It's all so parochial 
in comparison," said one. 
</P>
<P>
The school regards language as a means to an end rather than a subject in 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Children enter one of eight language sections -- English, French, German, 
Italian, Spanish, Greek, Dutch or Danish -- depending on the language at which 
they are best. English is the most popular section. 
</P>
<P>
They stay in these sections from kindergarten until the European baccalaureate 
exam at the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers say it is crucial for the children to develop a clear identity in one 
language and are unhappy when ambitious parents push young children into 
learning too many. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had kids who have no mother tongue. They are illiterate in four 
languages," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Children begin a first foreign language at the age of 6. From 12 or 13 they 
learn history and geography in that language, a subject they must follow right 
through to the baccalaureate. 
</P>
<P>
From 12 they may start a second language and more can be added later, including 
Latin. 
</P>
<P>
The baccalaureate is tough but widely regarded as a passport to European or 
North American universities, which is where most pupils go. Business studies or 
law are popular options. 
</P>
<P>
History and geography present problems of national bias. Historical figures 
like Joan of Arc or Napoleon, for instance, are revered in France but often 
criticized in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Most teachers at the school say that, as a result, most national textbooks, in 
whatever language, are almost useless. They use copies of original documents or 
prepare their own material. 
</P>
<P>
Irishman Richard Galvin is teaching a multicultural class of 12-year-olds about 
acid rain and refers constantly to different countries across Europe, combining 
facts with the teaching of English vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
"Pollution doesn't stop at national borders," he tells them. 
</P>
<P>
In the schoolyard, children start speaking in French and then turn to other 
friends and speak German or Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be independent, put yourself to work," said Bas Foppema, a 
17-year-old Dutch youth who speaks flawless English. "No teacher is going to 
tell you what to do." 
</P>
<P>
But there are problems with children who don't make the grade, since the school 
insists on mixed-ability classes and aims solely at getting pupils through the 
baccalaureate. 
</P>
<P>
Almost one pupil in 10 has to repeat a year because of unsatisfactory marks.

MULES PLAY KEY ROLE IN OPIUM TRADE;

PANGSUE, Myanmar 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The thousands of mules of drug warlord Khun Sa are being rested and fattened in 
the rich pastureland beyond the mountains of Pangsue in eastern Myanmar. 
</P>
<P>
They are gaining strength to carry a bumper opium harvest in the new year to 
clandestine laboratories that will convert it into heroin to satisfy the 
cravings of drug addicts the world over. 
</P>
<P>
The 6,000 residents of this muddy capital of Khun Sa's fiefdom in Shan state 
celebrated their New Year in November with games, folk dances, rock concerts at 
night and soccer matches during the day. 
</P>
<P>
They spoke of hundreds of relatives, soldiers of Gen. Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army, 
who could not join the festivities because they were tending mules beyond the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"The mules are allowed three months' rest after the rainy season and they are 
being fed to regain their strength. After they are strong enough, the mules 
will resume their hard work after the Chinese New Year," a villager said. 
</P>
<P>
During the rainy season, when four-wheel-drive vehicles cannot get through, 
caravans of hundreds of mules are used to bring supplies from Thailand to the 
army and civilian population of Khun Sa's rebel Burmese state. 
</P>
<P>
After the February dry-season harvest, the mules move the state's main product, 
opium, out of the inaccessible mountains to heroin factories spread throughout 
the Golden Triangle, where Myanmar, formerly Burma,Laos and Thailand meet. 
</P>
<P>
In 1991, their burden is expected to be a heavy one. 
</P>
<P>
"All the hills are covered with poppies this year," said a soldier who had just 
returned from the opium fields for the festival. 
</P>
<P>
"This year is the biggest I have ever seen and I have been with godfather Khun 
Sa for more than 12 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another returning soldier said the poppy plants, which yield the opium from 
which heroin is made, are already 3 feet high and look ready to produce a 
bumper crop by February. 
</P>
<P>
"They are blooming bright and will be ready for harvest by the Chinese New 
Year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thai anti-drug officials have predicted that favorable weather and political 
turmoil inside Myanmar would produce a record opium harvest. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. drug officials put last year's harvest at 4,000 tons, though they said 
some of this might have been damaged after harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the heroin sold in the United States originates in the Golden Triangle, 
they say, and about 65% of this comes from Myanmar. 
</P>
<P>
Thai officials said nearly 300,000 acres of Shan state have been turned over to 
poppy cultivation. 
</P>
<P>
Aides of the warlord say a drug-trafficking indictment handed down against him 
in March, 1989, in the United States has changed their boss's way of life. 
</P>
<P>
He no longer travels outside his own territory and, when he does travel, he is 
accompanied by 30 heavily armed guards. 
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa sleeps in a different house each night, they say.

PUBLIC HOUSING GUN BAN ANGERS TENANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

RICHMOND, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wave of fatal shootings, numerous burglaries and drug trafficking have 
persuaded some people to hold onto their weapons despite a ban on firearms in 
Richmond's public housing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather be safe than sorry," said Sondra Davis, 30, who lives with her 11- 
and 12-year-old daughters in the Hillside Court housing project. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams ruled Dec. 3 that the gun ban inserted 
into leases by the city housing authority in October was "part of a good-faith 
effort to improve the safety and quality of life in public housing." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling marked the first time a judge has upheld a gun ban in public housing 
in the United States, according to the National Rifle Assn. A Chicago ban on 
guns in public housing has not been challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said she won't be deterred by the rule, under which violators can be 
evicted. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of dying or one of my kids getting hurt, I'd just have to find another 
place to live," she said. "I'm not selling drugs. I'm just keeping a gun in my 
house for my protection." 
</P>
<P>
The Richmond Tenants Organization had challenged the ban as an unreasonable 
lease restriction that made the city's 14,000 public housing residents 
second-class citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Alma Barlow, president of the tenants group, said her group has not decided 
whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents of the city's 4,500 public housing units said the ban is a good 
idea if it helps reduce crime. They said they often hear shooting at night and 
have either been burglarized or seen people breaking into homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all right with me," said Lena Austin, 55, as she hung laundry outside her 
Hillside Court home. "They need to really buckle down." 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably stop more killing around here," said LaToya James, 18, who 
lives in the Blackwell complex. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of Richmond's record 111 slayings this year occurred in the seven 
housing projects, said Officer Stephen V. York, who compiles crime statistics 
for the Police Department. Many of Richmond's slayings were drug-related. 
Richmond had 98 slayings in all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 burglaries have been reported this year in public housing, York 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared to go out," said William Loney, 70, of Hillside Court. He said he 
was thinking about getting a gun that he keeps at a relative's house. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably do it anyway because if they say I can't keep guns they're 
responsible for my life."

SAMARKAND, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under a white mulberry tree, amid the aroma of roasting kebabs, wizened men in 
coats of many colors stare at chess pieces that might not have moved since 
Genghis Khan went home. 
</P>
<P>
If it's a bustling city of mainframe computers and brain surgeons, Samarkand is 
also a Tower of Babel exuding mystery, an air of high intrigue from its ancient 
days as a world capital. 
</P>
<P>
At the juncture of crosscurrents washing over Muslim Asia, it is emerging from 
70 years as a Soviet backwater. But authorities worry that this is a mixed 
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
"Samarkand is a living anthropology museum, unique in the world," said Sergei 
Kapitza, a Soviet scientist and television personality. "It is among the most 
fascinating places anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he added, it is an ethnic powder keg. The city's diverse past 
jostles the present, threatening a future that few venture to predict. 
</P>
<P>
Once it was remote, two time zones southeast of Moscow near the Afghan border 
in the region Rudyard Kipling called "the back of beyond." Now, in a smaller, 
turbulent world, its role has changed. 
</P>
<P>
The Russians who came as conquerors and colonizers are beginning to go home, 
leaving behind economic distress and communal tension. 
</P>
<P>
Samarkand recently declared itself 2,500 years old after historians, probing 
its earlier roots, threw up their hands. It was a center of world power before 
Columbus found America. 
</P>
<P>
Camel caravans bringing Chinese silks to Europe quickened their pace on nearing 
the gleaming city, a thriving oasis with all the comforts of its day, a blend 
of Islamic piety and secret sin. 
</P>
<P>
It was already a metropolis, ringed by 10 miles of ramparts, when Alexander the 
Great wrecked the place in 329 BC. Genghis Khan found splendid urban renewal 
900 years later, and he torched it. 
</P>
<P>
Tamerlane, a legendary 14th-Century ruler of Turkish origin, built soaring 
towers and domes, finished in azure tile and gold leaf. Scientists and scholars 
gathered to explore the universe. 
</P>
<P>
For centuries afterward, Samarkand was picky about its visitors. It was a hub 
on the Silk Road, but infidels were sometimes put to death. It fell to the 
czars' armies only in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the Cold War, Kremlin strategists sold its charms to group 
tourists, who were separated from local people as assiduously as they were 
separated from their hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
Perestroika was to have brought a tourist boom. As nationalist tensions run 
high in Central Asia, however, authorities fear that they may face an explosion 
of another kind. 
</P>
<P>
In the ancient center and the surrounding modern sprawl, 390,000 people of 90 
ethnic backgrounds cling to old customs that blended partly as a result of the 
firm hand of government. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are largely Uzbeks, people of Mongol and Turkish roots who settled in 
many centuries ago, and Tadzhiks, ethnic Persians whose ancestors built the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
There are also Russians who came as pioneers and professionals over the last 
century, along with Kazakhs, Turks, Bukhara Jews, Germans and scores of others. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Samarkand has escaped the pogroms, ethnic skirmishes and random 
violence that have killed more than 1,000 people over the last year in 
Uzbekistan and neighboring republics. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been living together here for so long that we are used to each other," 
said Davlat Sittar, an Uzbek university student who speaks fluent Russian and 
Tadzhik. 
</P>
<P>
But reports of upheaval nearby have stemmed the tide of foreign tourists 
expected with relaxed Soviet travel restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, Moscow radio reported ethnic riots in Samarkand which, in fact, did 
not happen. Uzbek newspapers reacted angrily but could not repair damage to the 
city's image. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to local dissidents who spoke only if promised anonymity, the 
potential of sudden flare-up lies just beneath the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Soviet officials say they are confident that Samarkand's stunning 
beauty and exotic flavor will draw more visitors than the city can handle. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, the Hotel Samarkand fills to capacity during the balmy months of 
spring and fall. Intourist is building a large new luxury hotel nearby in a 
joint venture with Indian investors. 
</P>
<P>
Each morning, busloads of Americans, Germans and Japanese clog the mud lanes 
running past monuments that have astonished visitors for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Ancient Samarkand sits in moldering glory at the center of the modern Soviet 
urban blur that spreads from its edges. Its main plaza is a dramatic square of 
arches and domes in rich colors. 
</P>
<P>
Tamerlane, the master builder and tyrant, lies blocks away under a gracefully 
shaped, fluted cupola tiled in the deep blue and gold hues that were his 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
Across town, a complex of blue-domed mausoleums line a sunken alley 100 yards 
long, each elaborately inlaid with ceramic mosaics, semiprecious stones and 
hardwoods. 
</P>
<P>
The old market sprawls from the magnificent ruins of the Bibi Khanum mosque to 
the outdoor teahouse where old men spend the day chatting and picking their 
toes. 
</P>
<P>
Many visitors find it as exciting to watch the people as the architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Men, Muslims and Jews alike, favor a white-embroidered black square skullcap. 
Robe styles date back to the first draft of the Bible. But there are also calf 
roper's baseball caps, faded designer jeans and Mickey Mouse T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Most women dress to tradition, in cape-like garments of cotton or silk in vivid 
patterns. Baggy pants reach below the ankles. Some women, mostly Russians, 
venture out with low necklines and high hems. 
</P>
<P>
All styles and colors blend in the market, a dusty sprawl of ancient brick, tin 
roofing and rickety stalls. Men doze at tables laden with spices. Women hawk 
fat red strawberries, mysterious grains and the Uzbeks' distinctive wheels of 
tasty flat bread. 
</P>
<P>
Samarkand is rich in legendary hospitality. On winding back streets, families 
make room at dinner tables, even wedding parties, for tourists who stop to show 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a smiling and gentle exterior masks ominous undercurrents that 
outsiders must probe to fathom. 
</P>
<P>
Newly established opposition parties, such as a grass-roots Uzbek movement 
called Birlik, or Unity, agitate for sovereignty and a return to Asian roots. 
Some organizations go further. 
</P>
<P>
"We are many, and we are growing," confided one dissident, a Tadzhik 
entrepreneur, who agreed to speak anonymously only after cautious 
introductions. He described underground groups that seek a total break with 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"Lithuania is a textbook, and we are reading it carefully," he said. But unlike 
the Baltic states, he added, Uzbekistan had a high potential for sustained 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
His own group is dominated by Tadzhiks who argue that since they built 
Samarkand, Soviet planners should have put it in Tadzhikistan, not Uzbekistan, 
and it is never too late to change.

HUSBAND-WIFE TEAM SEEKING TEACHER RIGHTS IN SAN DIEGO; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THEY MET AS UNION ACTIVISTS IN THE 1970S AND CONTINUE TO DEMAND 
EQUAL SAY IN TRAINING AND CURRICULUM FOR TEACHERS. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To many educators within the San Diego city schools system, Hugh and Gail Boyle 
are the "dynamic duo," a husband-and-wife teaching team who during the last 15 
years have influenced policies and reflected district trends more than any of 
their 6,000 colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1977, as head of the teachers union, Hugh Boyle led the first and only 
strike by city teachers, earning admiration from some -- but recognition from 
all -- for his willingness to challenge a recalcitrant school board. 
</P>
<P>
As union president between 1982 and 1986, Gail Boyle maintained a feisty, at 
times acrimonious, relationship with trustees and schools Supt. Tom Payzant 
during frequent battles over wages, working conditions and grievance 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
But today, once again in the union's top spot, Hugh occupies a centerpiece role 
in the joint effort by the San Diego Teachers Assn. and Payzant's 
administration to explore uncharted waters of labor-management cooperation. The 
key goals are to give teachers an equal say in training, curriculum and other 
major educational issues. 
</P>
<P>
Equally active on the cutting edge of public school reforms, Gail, a resource 
specialist at Wilson Middle School, wrestles with how to maintain longstanding 
labor rights while cajoling her peers to embrace new ideas for teaching and 
rewarding their increasingly multiethnic charges. Such ideas include trying 
unusual texts, using paper airplanes to teach math and keeping the same 
teachers with the same group of students through all three years of middle 
school.

<P>
The Boyles find themselves as emblematic of public education in San Diego in 
1990 as they were during the confrontational times of the last two decades. 
Indeed, they met as union activists during the early 1970s and remain convinced 
that labor unions can be an enhancement to education, rather than the 
impediment often portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody said this or anything else comes easy," said Gail Boyle, at age 44 
already a 23-year veteran of elementary and middle school instruction. She 
joined the district in 1967 as a student teacher out of San Diego State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"We're an association, long organized around (gaining members) and union 
contract issues, trying to change to one organized around teaching issues and 
questions of who teachers are and what they want to do" to improve schools. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Boyle, 57, admits that many teachers do not yet believe that principals or 
central office administrators will permit them to have important roles in 
deciding how a school should be organized and how best to teach mandated 
curricula. Some teachers doubt that even such new authority would guarantee 
gains in student achievement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a large district (179 schools) and we've only just scratched the 
surface," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His reputation as a firebrand from the 1977 strike -- he was ordered to serve 
40 days in jail and pay a $4,000 fine for contempt of court, a sentence later 
overturned by the California Supreme Court -- has given the veteran high school 
English teacher room within the union to push school reform together with 
Payzant. He is careful to spend time dealing with less-cosmic concerns -- dirty 
classrooms, dental benefits and membership dues -- that teachers still find 
central to their overall morale. 
</P>
<P>
"I want something to show for collaboration," he said, looking ahead to the end 
of his term in two years. "I want to be able to say we've improved education 
for students in San Diego." Still, he conceded that the jury remains out on 
whether the restructuring effort will take root. 
</P>
<P>
The term "school restructuring" encompasses a large number of potential 
reforms. From the Boyles' perspective, restructured schools would, among other 
things, encourage teachers to experiment with different ways of organizing 
their classroom by having principals reward flexible teaching styles; eliminate 
petty rules limiting telephone and copying machine use, which affects staff 
morale, and use teacher evaluations to improve instruction, not as a threat of 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Few area educators believe better risk-takers could be found for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"People are a little apprehensive (about restructuring) but I think they're the 
right people at the right time," said Marc Knapp, one of two San Diego teachers 
of the year for 1990. "We call them the 'dynamic duo' because while they have 
different personalities -- Gail is a real active, task-oriented slugger, Hugh 
is more cerebral and less demonstrative -- both are a pair of tough hombres. 
</P>
<P>
"Not that anyone falls down and genuflects before them," added Knapp, a member 
of the union's board of directors. "I (among others) can be a real thorn in 
Hugh's side at times, but I have huge respect for what he has done in seeing 
things down the road, out ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
Payzant credits Hugh with turning around more than five years of acrimony to 
work out a first-ever four-year contract that not only covered wages and 
grievances but established procedures for advancing educational reforms. The 
Panasonic Foundation had promised the district a long-term financial commitment 
to help pursue reform, but only if longstanding labor tensions were addressed. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest problems has been in perceptions among teachers that I now 
have Hugh in my pocket, and among my principals that Hugh now has me in his 
pocket," Payzant said. "The fear of one side dominating or manipulating the 
other remains one of the biggest challenges to restructuring and a new 
collaborative relationship." 
</P>
<P>
As for Gail Boyle, Payzant maintains he never took her attacks as union 
president personally. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, the public ground rules were clearly based on pressure, 
conflict, target the superintendent and the like," Payzant said. "But even 
then, away from the cameras she very much enjoyed talking about instructional 
issues, about how to do a better job in really caring about children and 
becoming more of an advocate for them." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Kay Davis has taken her share of stiletto-like barbs from both 
Gail and Hugh Boyle during eight years as a trustee. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they have realized, along with us, that the old ways of doing business 
are not going to work any longer in an urban district," Davis said. "But there 
would not have been a chance in hell to get anything started without the 
chemistry between Hugh and Tom (Payzant)." 
</P>
<P>
Both Boyles trace their fervor for reform to individual teaching experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Boyle spent 11 years -- 1977 to 1988 -- teaching English at San Diego High 
School between terms as association president. He had come to San Diego from 
Connecticut in 1967 and first took part in an experimental program at Hale 
Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
"At San Diego High, I saw what was happening to too many kids," he said of the 
heavily Latino downtown-area school. "My own kids went there and did well but I 
saw others after four years unprepared for the future, and that really has 
colored my outlook. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been nothing in the traditional (educational) system to make a person 
a better teacher if someone is not (motivated) to do it on their own. The 
evaluation system has been set up to get rid of people, instead of having the 
goal of improving instruction" by getting teachers to work at improving 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to raise the expectations of teachers just as we are trying to do with 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
Gail Boyle took a look at her own style after she returned to teaching at Mann 
Middle School in 1967 after her union presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"For years I believed the system was OK, that failure was not my responsibility 
but that of parents or someone else," she said. "But I realized that what I was 
doing in the classroom wasn't working for everybody, and I knew that education, 
as a system, was heading in the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
"And being very practical, I couldn't continue in the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Gail Boyle experimented with giving her regular English students the same 
materials -- the same novels, the same questions, the same chance to write and 
produce plays -- as her advanced, gifted class. Although she moved at a slower 
pace with the regular class, she found that the students gradually responded to 
challenging material, a big change from recall work and multiple-choice answer 
sheets. She could see that they learned to think on their own. 
</P>
<P>
"She is a wonderful teacher," said Maruta Gardner, her principal at Mann. "She 
is a great model for other teachers, particularly because at times she herself 
struggled, had to make adjustments, was not flawless. She was terrific to 
watch." 
</P>
<P>
Now at Wilson Middle School, one of several schools where teaching experiments 
are under way with a heavily Latino, black and Asian student population, Gail 
Boyle is trying to show teachers that they can work with administrators to 
enhance instruction without sacrificing union protections. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, she hopes to prove that the union's collaborative philosophy can 
pay off. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, I'm in charge of (improving) discipline this year," she said. 
"But the (administration) has to realize that there isn't just one way to force 
teachers to do it. One method may work great if a teacher is assertive, but may 
fail miserably if the teacher isn't. 
</P>
<P>
In her view, when the San Diego district picks up on a new or interesting idea 
about teaching, it traditionally has mandated the technique for everyone 
despite research that shows no single method is going to work in all classes, 
given the diversity of the 122,000 students who make up the nation's 
sixth-largest urban school system. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Boyles believe they can find a new balance between legitimate labor 
concerns and the pressing need for teachers to change. 
</P>
<P>
"Unions are an easy scapegoat," Gail Boyle said. "Sure, we have incompetent 
people within the union but we also have great people, like Janet Gabay (1990 
National Teacher of the Year). 
</P>
<P>
"Problems in schools fall not just on teachers but on everyone -- parents and 
principals and superintendents as well."

Late Fall Rarities -- Although the latter half of the fall migration of birds 
was slow locally, there have still been several rare sightings of birds in the 
county, according to the Sea &amp; Sage Chapter of the National Audubon 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-nine clapper rails, which are on the state and U.S. endangered species 
lists, were spotted during a census conducted in the Seal Beach National Refuge 
on Nov. 2. These secretive and sedentary birds are found only in California, 
with more than half of the bird's population habitating the dense cord grass 
stands of Upper Newport Bay. The nesting population in Seal Beach had declined 
in recent years because of foxes and other predators, but the early November 
count shows that recovery efforts -- including the use of innovative man-made 
nesting platforms -- seem to be paying off. Other interesting birds spotted 
that day were four American bittern and a parasitic jaeger. 
</P>
<P>
The first county record of a gray catbird, a member of the thrasher family and 
very rare in the southwestern states, was made Oct. 19 when one was discovered 
near the mouth of the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 18, just a few miles up the Santa Ana River from where the catbird was 
seen, a yellow-green vireo was spotted. It was only the fifth sighting in the 
county. The vireo is indigenous to Mexico and other areas south of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Several chestnut-collared longspurs were seen around UC Irvine in mid-October, 
while a McCown's longspur was spotted in the same area Oct. 25. The next day, 
two McCown's were spotted there along with a laplands. A Baird's sandpiper, 
very rare for this late in the season, was spotted at San Joaquin Marsh in late 
October. Other highlights include four snow geese at the Burris Pit in Anaheim, 
sighted with a hooded merganser on Nov. 3; and a female Eurasian wigeon spotted 
in the Upper Newport Bay on Oct. 8 (a male was spotted in the same area later 
that month). 
</P>
<P>
More Museum News -- While the Museum of Natural History and Science's exhibits 
of dinosaurs and space have been getting all the attention, a Discovery World 
for children has also opened at the museum's new space in Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The hands-on "world" allows children to explore such exhibits as "Wonder 
Boxes," "Skeleton Station," "Touch Wall" and "Space Trek." 
</P>
<P>
The museum's new site is at 150 Columbia in the Koll Corporate Center. It is 
open during the holiday season from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday, 
and 1 to 5 p.m. Sunday. It will be closed Christmas and New Year's days.

'LAGUNA GAY LIFE EBBING AWAY' -- A DISSERVICE TO THE RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to the article "Laguna Beach Gay Life Ebbing Away" (Dec. 9) about 
Laguna Beach, your newspaper did a great disservice to this community. 
</P>
<P>
The tenor of the article perpetuates the myth that AIDS is a gay disease. 
</P>
<P>
This only serves to keep the general population ignorant of the brutal and 
unforgiving statistics currently being collected. 
</P>
<P>
When the incidence of the disease on a per-capita basis was cited, the story 
failed to observe that doctors and hospitals in this community accurately 
report the disease as a primary cause of death, while many others in the state 
and the country opt for reporting some other condition in an effort to avoid 
the stigma of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
A person with AIDS is apt to come to this city seeking dignified care and 
support -- which inflates the incidence rate -- more than to other cities that 
are still floundering in bureaucratic morass, bias and bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
The story resorted to ridiculous observations that "25% of the city's 
population is gay" and "since the '20s, the city has been a mecca for 
homosexuals." Those numbers have no basis in fact. Believing that this 
community of 25,000 contains 6,000 or more gay individuals is ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
The assumption that the city is a mecca for homosexuals is a vapid, inane 
claim. This city is an energetic, aesthetic, geographic wonder with a strong 
business and social direction and a history of being an artistic vortex.

AHIMSA'S ROLE IN NURSING CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My letter is a response to the article about Ahimsa Care Facility in Laguna 
Beach ("State Health Department Cites Ahimsa Center," Nov. 21). For the past 
three years, I have been a frequent visitor to Ahimsa Nursing Home in Laguna 
Beach, primarily to visit friends in the terminal stages of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
I have visited Ahimsa at various times of the day and evening. I have eaten 
numerous times there. I have bathed friends using the Ahimsa facilities. I have 
been involved with patient care. I have talked with the administration, and I 
have prayed there. 
</P>
<P>
I feel very qualified to speak with authority about Ahimsa as a care facility. 
I have observed only kindness, patience and courtesy extended toward patients. 
The nursing and administrative staff are professional and caring as they 
administer their duties. 
</P>
<P>
The place is kept very clean. The meals are warm, nutritious and appetizing. 
Even as one enters the doors, one feels a warmth and decency about the place. 
</P>
<P>
In my lifetime, I have had to place both my father and my grandmother in care 
facilities, so I am acutely knowledgeable of their service and quality. I would 
not hesitate to place a loved one at Ahimsa and, indeed, would feel fortunate 
to have a place in a care facility as decent as Ahimsa. 
</P>
<P>
Some people who visit a care facility are immediately overcome with negativity 
because they are forced to see people in pain, people who are confused and 
people who are in the terminal stages of disease. 
</P>
<P>
I see the professional and kind workers at Ahimsa deal each day in a positive 
and loving manner making the last days of our loved ones as decent, dignified 
and human as they possibly can. They deserve our praise and thanks. It is a 
hard job.

ARRESTING WOMEN WHO SOLICIT DRINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most cities have operating budgets strained to the breaking point, violent 
crime is out of control and the police and Alcohol Beverage Control Commission 
guys are busting women in Santa Ana bars for soliciting men to buy them drinks 
("Bar Raids Net Women Who Allegedly Solicit Drinks," Dec. 9). 
</P>
<P>
This is the most stupid use of taxpayers' money that I have seen in a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
And how about the buying male customers (Let's call them Dons -- not to be 
confused with Johns)? Are the police arresting and deporting them also? 
</P>
<P>
This law should be stripped from the books in Sacramento, and the enforcement 
money used for more constructive purposes, such as alcohol and drug 
rehabilitation and drunk-driving enforcement.

DIVERSITY OF U.S. RELIGIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent study on schoolbook challenges ("Schoolbook Challenges on Steady 
Course," Dec. 7) is only going to get worse. 
</P>
<P>
The far-too-often-quoted Rev. Louis P. Sheldon of the Coalition for Traditional 
(Christian Fundamentalist) Values in Anaheim is going to have an even greater 
challenge to his effort to establish Christian Fundamentalism as the one and 
only true and established state religion in his Christian America. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the now 10 million American Moslems (latest count and growing) are going 
to be making their voices heard in the public school system. Soon, the likes of 
the Rev. Pat Robertson and the Rev. Lou Sheldon will have to face the reality 
that America is now, in 1990, a Judeo-Christian-Islamic nation with a strong 
and growing minority of Buddhists from Vietnam, China, Japan and Cambodia, all 
legally voting and intelligent American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the educational system is going to have realities from all over the world 
that will turn the hair of Sheldon and Robertson Santa Claus white. And it's 
about time. 
</P>
<P>
America is fast becoming the first international and universal nation on earth. 
Let's all wake up and smell the coffee, Rev. Lou and Rev. Pat!

PERSPECTIVE ON THE WATER SHORTAGE; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE HOLDS KEY TO FUTURE PLENITUDE, NOT DEVELOPERS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW HOMES, WITH WATER-SAVING FIXTURES THROUGHOUT, ARE NEARLY 25% MORE WATER 
EFFICIENT THAN OLDER HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAER PEARCE, Laer Pearce owns an Irvine-based public relations agency and 
writes a newsletter on environmental issues for the building industry. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reminiscent of the meatpacker that said it used every part of the pig but the 
squeal, those who wish to stop new home development seem capable of rendering 
nearly any conceivable issue into an argument against new homes. The current 
argument that new home development should be stopped because of the drought is 
based more on fervor than fact, however, since these are the very developments 
that do the most to reduce water use. 
</P>
<P>
Many cling to the belief that Orange County's growth is still the result of 
incoming floods of outsiders. That is no longer the case; the flood is more one 
of little squirts -- our own children -- because most of the county's growth is 
now internally generated. Consequently, most new homes shelter our own growing 
families and those of our children. These homes don't result in increased water 
use, then. They only result in the water that would have been used anyway 
coming out of new faucets. 
</P>
<P>
That is a considerable improvement. 
</P>
<P>
New homes, equipped with water-saving fixtures from the kitchen to the 
bathroom, are nearly 25% more water efficient than older homes, according to 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This drop, from 77 gallons per 
capita per day to just 60, is the result of such fixtures as new shower heads 
that save seven gallons per shower and toilets that save more than two gallons 
per flush. One-quarter of water-related arguments against new housing go down 
the drain once this is realized. 
</P>
<P>
But household water use is a rather insignificant portion of overall municipal 
water consumption. Orange County's biggest water use is landscape irrigation. 
Here new home developments offer an even greater degree of conservation versus 
older neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Well-planned new communities such as Irvine and Mission Viejo use water 
reclamation systems, so greenbelts, medians and parks are irrigated by recycled 
water that is wasted in older communities. New communities use drought-tolerant 
landscaping and efficient irrigation, including computer-controlled systems 
that measure the soil's water content and operate only when needed. These new 
developments showcase water conservation techniques, while older neighborhoods 
are examples of how not to landscape and irrigate in a semiarid climate. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of criticizing new home development, a much more positive tack is to 
look at the larger picture. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District, which provides 70% of our county's water, is 
hurt more by politics than by drought. While the drought has certainly 
diminished water levels, look what politics has done: It has halved the amount 
of water we will be able to draw from the Colorado River, it defeated the 
Peripheral Canal and it is threatening sources in the Sierra Nevada. Most 
seriously, it is preventing formulation of a much-needed statewide water 
conservation and allocation policy. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the political water wars between Southern California and its 
water sources to the east and north pit brother unknowingly against brother. 
Residents of mountain hamlets, the San Francisco Bay Area and the Southland 
alike are pipsqueaks fighting each other for drops, while largely ignoring the 
state's main water consumer: agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 5% of Orange County's water goes to agricultural use, but 83% of our 
water statewide is used on farms. To put this in perspective, consider that 
more water is used irrigating California's alfalfa crop than is consumed by the 
entire Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas combined -- and alfalfa 
is but one of the four big water users in California agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Most of this water is purchased at government-subsidized rates by agribusiness 
operations. They use loopholes to gain water subsidies meant to protect small 
family farms. As a result, they pay as little as $2.50 per acre-foot for water 
that costs the Metropolitan Water District $19 per acre-foot. Of course, MWD 
passes its higher cost on to us. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the building industry discovers new ways to greatly reduce residential 
water consumption, the total saved would be a drop in the bucket compared with 
what agribusiness could conserve through a tiny percentage decrease in water 
use. In fact, a UC Davis study recently showed that a 10% decrease in 
agriculture water consumption would meet water needs of the state's urban 
population for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive state water strategy could accomplish a balancing of urban, 
agricultural, recreational and environmental water needs. A good first step of 
such a strategy would be to require agribusiness to pay a non-subsidized price 
for water so it has an incentive to conserve. Learning from such countries as 
Israel, which have mastered water-conserving farming, California's agricultural 
sector could become a world leader in efficient irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
The potential savings are vast. In Israel, highly efficient irrigation systems 
have reduced the amount of water used per acre of farm by 50% to 70%. From 1951 
to 1985, the amount of land under irrigation in Israel grew 335%, while 
agricultural water use barely doubled, because just 20% of the country's 
irrigation water is lost. 
</P>
<P>
In the attacks on well-planned new developments that offer water-efficient 
homes and drought-tolerant landscaping, we see a continuation of the kind of 
political manipulation and blame-shifting that keeps Californians from doing 
what must be done to protect our precious water resources. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has a long history of carefully managing its water supply. 
Instead of bickering among ourselves, we should build on our success to date 
and encourage the rest of the state to get on with creating a statewide water 
resource management plan.

NEW IRVINE MAYOR SHERIDAN'S SENSITIVITY TO PUBLIC CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You know what? Sally Anne Sheridan has it all wrong. As Irvine's new mayor, she 
is often the subject of criticism, which she interprets as so many "personal 
attacks." She seems convinced that the only conceivable reason for this 
criticism of her is that she is not Larry Agran. 
</P>
<P>
She regularly remarks in interviews that those members of the community who 
often voice concerns at City Council meetings during public comments are simply 
experiencing a bad case of sour grapes, whining because their political messiah 
has been succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
There could not be legitimate reason for criticism of the new council, after 
all; it is simply Larry's personality cult, his "Agranistas," licking their 
wounds and healing their bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Mrs. Sheridan has accused Irvine Tomorrow of being just such a 
fan club, whose bimonthly field trips to City Hall are mere crusades to make 
her life miserable, thereby assuaging their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of Irvine Tomorrow, I must say that the mayor's assessment of my 
motives and goals is somewhat less than right on the money. I think I 
understand fairly well my reasons for participating in the group, and they are 
utterly unrelated to my personal feelings for either her or Larry Agran. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I am concerned about too-rapid development (with too little 
affordable housing to satisfy the housing element of the General Plan), and I 
fear the aggravated traffic conditions that will follow such development. I am 
concerned that political participation by Irvine's citizens may be disdained 
and/or curbed by the City Council. I am uncomfortable that my elected 
officials' judgment in matters of importance to the city and people of Irvine 
may be tainted by potential or real conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
My motivation for participation is really quite simple. I have a sincere 
interest in, and legitimate concern for, the problems facing Irvine today, and 
I want to see everyone live in a better Irvine tomorrow. Any questions?

STUDENTS WHO PROTEST THE GULF CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read a letter to The Times (Dec. 2) from Irving E. Friedman regarding his 
"great disappointment" (over) the protesting high school students. 
</P>
<P>
I am a student at Dana Hills High School, which is one of the schools that had 
students protesting the military forces in the Middle East and had students 
protesting the protesters. I am appalled at the condescending attitude of this 
teacher. We are peacefully voicing our opinions of the crisis, and, instead of 
being praised for it, we are criticized by some parents, students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
In our school systems, we are taught to solve our problems in peaceful and 
non-violent ways. Our country was founded by protesting the taxes and laws 
imposed by the British. In America we need to protest against what we believe 
to be wrong, and society should support the peaceful protests of these 
students. 
</P>
<P>
High school students usually cannot vote because of their age and this is the 
only way they can tell their government what they think. This letter is my form 
of protesting the ignorance of people who want students to be taught about 
history but do not want them to take part in making history. If students learn 
to voice their opinions peacefully, this can help lead to understanding between 
races, religions and even countries. When young adults learn not to fight, that 
means a more peaceful future for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Friedman says "no sane . . . person is in favor of war, but there are worse 
things." I agree with him. Losing your son, brother or father are the worst 
things in life. These things would rapidly occur if we went to war with a 
country that boasts about its million-man army. We should all protest this 
potential war with Iraq because oil is not worth a single human life.

PARKING BIND IN SAN JUAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to the editorial "A Welcome Investment in Train Depots" (Dec. 9), 
let me clarify what I believe to be the motives behind the city of San Juan 
Capistrano's interest in modernizing the depot. 
</P>
<P>
Recently my husband and I had occasion to visit San Diego. Why not take Amtrak? 
We would save on gasoline (less pollution) and have a relaxing ride down the 
coast. What could be more pleasant? 
</P>
<P>
The shocker came when we tried to park. Like most locals, we usually park near 
the stores we patronize or, when visiting our nice new movie theater, in the 
three-hour spaces in the adjacent parking structure. All-day parking for the 
Amtrak is something else. 
</P>
<P>
Since our journey was later than the usual daily commute, all available 
unrestricted spaces were filled, both alongside the depot and inside the 
parking structure. Street spaces were also taken, but there were numerous 
three-hour spaces immediately outside the depot and on two levels of the 
parking structure. Departure time loomed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, saying, "What the heck!" we left the car in the farthest corner of the 
deserted upper level and made for the train. After a pleasant day in San Diego, 
we returned to find, you guessed it, a $27 parking ticket. The area was still 
deserted. 
</P>
<P>
Our fault? Of course. But what about available parking for people who actually 
wish to travel on the train and not just dine in a comfortable, quaint little 
restaurant? 
</P>
<P>
You see, the city's true motive in refurbishing the depot is not to make things 
more convenient for those pesky travelers. It's the Big "P" -- Profit, in the 
form of increased revenues from restaurants. Hence all of those convenient 
three-hour parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the depot is ready for 20th-Century travel, how about some 
20th-Century parking? 
</P>

DIAPER SERVICES ARE ANSWER TO POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your Consumer Affairs column, "Needed: A Disposable/Cloth Diaper Hybrid" (Nov. 
16), concluded with the theme that a natural solution is still required. The 
proven solution to diaper pollution is offered by a professional diaper 
service. 
</P>
<P>
At Dydee Diaper Service in Orange, of which I am president, we use a special 
10-step process for laundering soiled diapers that includes several flushings, 
sudsings and rinsings using only 88% pure soap. This process generates about 4 
1/2 gallons of waste water per child per day, less than the water used in one 
average toilet flush, and four times less than the amount of water a parent 
would use if they were to flush the solid waste from their disposable diapers 
as the package recommends. 
</P>
<P>
As for fuel conservation, Dydee's delivery trucks are powered by clean burning 
propane, compared to the fuel used to deliver the trees from the forest (more 
than 2 million a year) to produce disposable diapers, to deliver them to retail 
stores and to take the soiled disposable diaper to the landfill, plus the 
powered machinery used to level the trash there. 
</P>
<P>
To conserve energy, we use special equipment that reclaims heat from our dryers 
and waste water. 
</P>
<P>
Disposable diapers create 90 times more solid waste than a reusable cotton 
diaper. For every baby in cotton diapers, more than a ton of paper diaper waste 
is diverted from landfills. Environmental groups will always recommend a 
reusable product over a single-use one.

MCA WAS OUT-NEGOTIATED BY ITS JAPANESE SUITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your articles by Tom Petruno and James Flanigan, "Is MCA Smart to Sell Now . 
. . Or Should It Have Held On?" (Nov. 28), Petruno is probably correct that now 
is a time to sell if you must. But as Flanigan points out, there was no 
apparent compelling economic reason for MCA to sell at this time. 
</P>
<P>
With so much indicated value left on the table, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Lew R. Wasserman, et al., were simply ill-prepared and out-negotiated. 
Negotiating from a position of overwhelming strength, as MCA did for years, 
makes for reputation but does not sharpen bargaining skills. 
</P>
<P>
If Flanigan's figures are correct, the results suggest that the MCA team 
neither set concrete limits nor did it make an effort to assess the real value 
of the deal to Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer's value assessment is critical for determining the bluff-content of 
Japanese negotiating tactics, which rely more on harangue and walkouts than on 
the quibbling with numbers to which Americans are more accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
Without a definite negotiating plan, it is very difficult to resist the 
enormous pressure the Japanese place on their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad for MCA shareholders; good for Matsushita and Michael Ovitz for the 
better-played game.

CBS FAILED TO PURSUE AUDIENCE FOR BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story, "CBS Expects Its First Loss in Decades" (Nov. 20), overlooks a 
factor contributing to the network's baseball-related financial woes: It has 
clearly demonstrated only a half-hearted commitment to the sport, thereby 
discouraging regular viewers. 
</P>
<P>
During the season, CBS sporadically aired only a handful of games. 
</P>
<P>
After shelling out more than $1 billion for the right to broadcast baseball, 
one would think that the network would aggressively pursue a steady audience -- 
or, at the very least, formulate a set broadcast schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Further evidence that the network is not serious about building baseball 
viewership is its decision to air one of the playoff games on a Monday 
afternoon rather than pursue prime-time competition with "Monday Night 
Football." Thanks to CBS, baseball fans have now learned that the "hidden ball 
trick" is not just for infielders. 
</P>
<P>
The first year of the contract between CBS and Major League Baseball has been a 
fiasco for the network, the fans and the game. As a lifelong baseball fan, I 
hope that in the next round of negotiations for the broadcast rights to 
baseball, Major League Baseball will consider factors about its suitors other 
than the size of their bids.

NEW FEDERAL CHILD-CARE LEGISLATION PROVIDES FOUNDATION ON WHICH TO BUILD IN THE 
FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harry Bernstein's column, "New Child-Care Law Gets a D-Minus" (Nov. 13), 
downgrades the achievement marked by the United States' first national 
child-care legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein correctly points out that compared to European countries the United 
States lags far behind in its support for child-care facilities, parental leave 
policies and access to prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
But he fails to mention that this is a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
The law provides $2.5-billion in federal child-care block-grant funds over 
three years, $1.5 billion over five years to help families at risk of welfare 
dependency to purchase child care and $18.2 billion in tax relief for 
low-income working families. California will receive $67.6 million of these 
funds in fiscal 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation will improve the quality and availability of child care. The 
safeguards and protections for those in child care will affect all children, 
not just those who are publicly subsidized. Most important, the legislation 
provides a base from which we can work to improve national and state child-care 
services and policies in the years ahead.

HIDDEN HOMELESS NEED WOMEN'S SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I felt both compassion and anger for the people depicted in this article. This 
privileged social class is intolerant of their impoverishment and yet their 
goal is not to change the system, but to return to it as fast as they can. 
</P>
<P>
Their social awakening seems self-serving since their determination is not to 
challenge their class to change, but merely to get enough money to return to 
it. By hiding this situation from their kids, they enable them to perpetuate a 
system that victimizes them. 
</P>
<P>
If these women communicated their situation with their kids instead of letting 
them climb the economic ladder unfettered, it might impel (their children to 
support) social change. Why do none of these women want to revolt against these 
families and friends who cloister themselves in an ill-gotten world of 
privilege? Can they really want to return to the status quo, having seen at 
what price it is maintained?

ERMA BOMBECK: FATHER KNOWS BEST -- COUNT ON IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My husband is the parent with credibility in this family. I lost mine the day I 
threatened one of the kids with, "You clean your room or you'll never see me 
again. I mean it. I'm going to go to Africa and sit on a hillside with Jane 
Goodall and watch chimpanzees for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
They knew I was bluffing. I wasn't going to do that. I wouldn't go anywhere 
without a mall nearby. 
</P>
<P>
After years of my exaggeration, they just sort of roll their eyes upward, shake 
their heads and say, "Mom! You can't believe anything she tells you." But when 
their father speaks . . . every word is chiseled on stone tablets. It is so. 
</P>
<P>
He is to integrity what Walter Cronkite is to broadcasting, Mother Teresa is to 
the poor and Lawrence Welk is to the polka. In a world of Janet Cookes, Ivan 
Boeskys and Milli Vanillis, he shines like a beacon of goodness. He has given 
his children their motto for life: "In Dad We Trust." 
</P>
<P>
(I know this is taking a long time to build, but it's necessary to point out 
how far he had to fall.) 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago at breakfast, the Prince of Goodness announced to his son 
(a USC grad) that the Trojans had beaten Notre Dame. He had heard it on a 
late-night sportscast. 
</P>
<P>
The kid was not only numb, he was ecstatic. Imagine that. SC knocked off the 
Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Later that night, he and his brother were flipping TV channels when they landed 
on a replay of the USC-Notre Dame game. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Notre Dame was winning, our younger son wasn't worried. His father 
had told him the final score. 
</P>
<P>
With five minutes left to play, his brother said, "It's all over." 
</P>
<P>
The kid who had heard his dad's proclamation of a USC victory stood firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The game's not over until it's over," he smiled. "They'll pull it out of the 
fire. You'll see." 
</P>
<P>
His brother looked at him like his pilot light just went out. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you nuts? There's no way in the world USC can win." 
</P>
<P>
With a minute left, the younger brother's eyes were still glued to the screen 
awaiting the miracle that was prophesied. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't rule out an 80-yard pass," he said to his brother. "They don't even have 
the ball," his brother yelled back. 
</P>
<P>
When the final score was announced -- Notre Dame 10, USC 6 -- I expected him to 
lose faith in his dad . . . kind of like finding out Smokey the Bear plays with 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he smiled and said, "Dad probably did me a big favor. Anyone else 
would have walked out in the third quarter."

ROGER SIMON: 10 YEARS AFTER LENNON'S DEATH, THERE'S STILL NO GUN CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does the name Linda Greenwood ring a bell? How about David Burnell or Joshua 
Brown? No? Well, how about John Lennon? 
</P>
<P>
Ahh. Him you've heard of. Caught four slugs from a .38 10 years ago and died. 
There was quite a to-do at the time, as I recall. 
</P>
<P>
There were candle-lighting ceremonies. People stood and bowed their heads for 
10 minutes of silence. And there were lots of stories. Lots and lots of stories 
about the Beatle who got killed. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Greenwood and those other people I mentioned were gunned down the same 
day John Lennon was. But there was no to-do over them. 
</P>
<P>
How could there be? More than five dozen people are killed with handguns every 
day in this country. And if we stopped to light candles to all of them, well, 
we could hardly get anything done, could we? 
</P>
<P>
Even though the number of homicides is really soaring in America this year, it 
is often hard to find much information on the victims. It is sometimes hard 
even to find their names. 
</P>
<P>
Some names, however, will always be easier to find than others. Take Jay Bias. 
</P>
<P>
Ahh. Another name you've probably heard of. He was the brother of Len Bias, 
University of Maryland basketball superstar, who in 1986 celebrated his 
multimillion-dollar contract with the Boston Celtics by ingesting enough 
cocaine to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
And this was certainly enough to make us care about the fate of his younger 
brother -- who was gunned down outside a shopping mall last week, an apparent 
innocent victim. And the 113th homicide victim this year in Prince George's 
County, outside Washington, D.C. (which happens to be the county in which I 
live). 
</P>
<P>
All the elements of a good story were there: There was a celebrity. There was a 
family touched twice by tragedy. And there was an upbeat note: Jay Bias' 
father, James, has decided to fight for handgun control now that his son is 
dead, just like his wife dedicated her life to fighting drugs after Len died. 
</P>
<P>
James Bias announced he would form a coalition with Jesse Jackson, no less, "to 
fight for gun control and to educate youths on alternatives to violence." 
</P>
<P>
"This is something I've been feeling for years but have not acted on it," James 
Bias said. "I feel grief, but I feel if I don't act now, your child and your 
child could be next." 
</P>
<P>
One wishes him well. His pain is genuine and his intentions sincere. 
</P>
<P>
But if one acts on one's feelings about handgun violence only after one's own 
son is killed, then the price is too high. And the problem will never be 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
This week, I looked up the column I did 10 years ago on the death of John 
Lennon. I guess I was in a pretty bad mood. All around me people were lighting 
candles and singing "Give Peace a Chance" and pledging to make their grief 
"meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
But I kind of doubted it. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not one of those who believes (Lennon's) death will so shock us, so 
devastate us, that we will really achieve gun control in this country," I 
wrote. "Successful politicians stay successful by giving the people what they 
want. And if there really were enormous support for gun control in this 
country, the politicians would fall over themselves providing it. But lighting 
candles for John Lennon isn't going to cause that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"How come people can't get effective gun-control laws passed? Maybe it's 
because they don't stay passionate long enough. Maybe it's because those people 
who were silent for 10 minutes for John Lennon are going to stay silent for the 
next 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's 10 years later, folks. And we don't have effective gun control 
legislation yet. And the slaughter goes on. You may have seen the story the 
other day: More than a dozen U.S. cities, including eight of the 20 largest 
cities, already have broken their homicide records with still a month left in 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this is the same year that the Brady bill was never even brought to a vote 
before the House of Representatives. The Brady bill (named for President 
Reagan's press secretary, who was wounded in the assassination attempt on 
Reagan) is mild as far as gun control goes. 
</P>
<P>
All it would do is require a seven-day waiting period before a person could buy 
a handgun from a gun dealer. That's all. It doesn't even require a background 
check. 
</P>
<P>
Just a seven-day waiting period so if you get angry at your boss in the 
morning, you can't buy a handgun on your lunch hour and shoot him that same 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Don't laugh; it happens. 
</P>
<P>
The Brady bill passed the House Judiciary Committee by a vote of 27-9 this 
year, but it was never called for a vote before the full House. And so it died. 
</P>
<P>
And so in 1991 its supporters will have to begin again from the beginning. They 
will begin again to find out how many people still care. 
</P>
<P>
If we had such a bill 10 years ago, would John Lennon and Jay Bias and tens of 
thousands of others still be alive? I cannot say. I can only say it would have 
been worth a try. 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to care about the death of a celebrity. It is easy, though painful, 
to care about the death of a loved one. 
</P>
<P>
But the trick is to care about those whose names you never read and faces you 
never see. 
</P>
<P>
The real trick is to care about those thousands who are slaughtered simply 
because it is too easy to get a handgun in this country. 
</P>
<P>
And when we can bring ourselves finally to care about them, gun control in 
America may become a reality.

ZAN THOMPSON: RAISING FUNDS, HOT-AIR BALLOONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ZAN THOMPSON

<TEXT>
<P>
Chuck Bump once landed his hot-air balloon at a McDonald's restaurant in 
Sherbrooke, Quebec. The immense pear-shaped craft landed beside the microphone 
where drive-through customers give their orders. 
</P>
<P>
Bump is a huge man with a bonfire of red curly hair. He lives in Vancouver, 
B.C., and was North American hot-air balloon champion for 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The voice over the speaker asked for his order and Bump said, "I'll have two 
Egg McMuffins and a Diet Coke." 
</P>
<P>
The speaker voice said, "Just drive around to the window and pick up your 
order." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't," said Bump, "I'm in a hot-air balloon." The restaurant emptied of 
customers and staff who surrounded the big man from space. 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Ann Marie Boyle, Jean Erck and I went to the Stouffer Esmeralda Balloon 
and Polo Festival at the Empire Polo Field in Indio on a recent bright blue 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Balloon pilots from 14 states and four countries -- among them the current 
champions from England, Canada and Holland -- filled the skies, making 
crayon-colored shapes against the dark blue mountains. 
</P>
<P>
We chose a table in the fenced area in front of the Stouffer Esmeralda 
hospitality tent and prepared to watch the beautiful polo ponies and the fairy 
tale balloons. Two men came up and asked if we were using the spare chairs and 
Jean, who has a sunshine friendliness said, "Sit with us if you'd like." 
</P>
<P>
They did and we met Chuck Bump and Bob Burch, a champion balloonist from 
Quebec. Burch explained that the ballooning event was to raise money to bring a 
planetarium to the Children's Museum of the Desert in Palm Desert. Minolta 
Camera wants to teach kids astronomy. (Brian Deis, director of marketing and 
sales for the Planetarium Division of Minolta, told us that 28% of adults in 
the United States think that the sun goes around the moon.) 
</P>
<P>
Bob Burch flies the Minolta balloon and was one of the pilots who took his 
balloon to a Coachella Valley School, delighting the kids. Twenty-five thousand 
Coachella Valley elementary schoolchildren have already been studying geography 
through a program sponsored by Minolta in which they earn ribbons and awards 
for recognizing states and countries from clues the teachers give them. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Burch told us that Minolta's founder, Kazuo Tashima, had loved the stars 
since he was a little boy, and during the 1950s, he realized that bright city 
lights and pollution were robbing the new generation of the wonder of the 
stars. In 1956, he began to build planetariums to bring the wonder of the night 
sky to as many people as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Burch said, "Would you like to take a balloon ride?" I said yes before Bob 
finished the question. 
</P>
<P>
The crew began to blow up the balloon. Bob had brought his envelope (what the 
balloon is called) from Montreal. The envelope carries a basket holding propane 
tanks that roar hot air into the envelope with the augmentation of a large 
electric fan. 
</P>
<P>
When the envelope was filled, Bob and crewman Bill Porter, a Long Beach 
photographer, lifted me into the basket and pilot Bob coaxed the balloon into 
the sky by adding and subtracting hot air. In a few seconds, we were floating 
above the polo field and over the Coachella Valley. There was silence except 
when the propane tanks roared their heat into the envelope. 
</P>
<P>
Bob took us up to more than one quarter of a mile. From that altitude we could 
see the entire Coachella Valley from the Salton Sea to the east to the town of 
White Water at the west end of the valley. 
</P>
<P>
We floated over a perfect date grove, looking into the hearts of palm trees 
that look like giant chrysanthemums from above. We floated over golf courses, 
picked out freeways and waved to kids who ran to look up as the blue and silver 
Minolta balloon went over in utter silence. 
</P>
<P>
Bill radioed, "Minolta chase. Do you read? Copy." 
</P>
<P>
The chase car answered that they could see us and were following our shadow. We 
cleared a drainage canal and landed on a private golf course. In seconds, the 
white chase van arrived, carrying Valley View School teacher Jim Jones, whose 
students had been winners in the geography competition, and his son, Eric, and 
Jo Dee Hunt, a balloonophile from Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
When we landed, Bill Porter said there was a traditional ceremony for 
first-time balloonists. He opened a chilled bottle of champagne from the van 
and poured us all a splash of the bubbly. 
</P>
<P>
Then he recited the balloonists' blessing: 
</P>
<P>
 "The winds have welcomed you with softness. The sun has blessed you with its 
warm hands. You have flown so high and so well that God has joined you in your 
laughter and He has set you gently back again into the arms of Mother Earth."

SUMMER WISHES, WINTER DREAM: CRANBERRY SHORTCAKE FOR THE HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Lazarus in Columbus, Ohio.

<P>
If you're thinking about holiday desserts and wishing it were summer so you 
could serve strawberry shortcake, here's an interesting thought: Why not make 
cranberry shortcakes? 
</P>
<P>
The cranberry filling is a simple preparation -- fresh cranberries cooked only 
with sugar, cinnamon and orange peel. The shortbreads, made with toasted 
chopped pecans, are light and airy inside with slightly crusty exteriors. 
Dusted with powdered sugar and filled with the glistening cranberry mixture, 
they look stunning. 
</P>
<P>
Even better, the cranberry filling can be assembled up to two days ahead and 
the shortcakes baked early on the day needed. This is a truly stellar ending to 
a holiday fete. 
</P>
<P>
CRANBERRY 
</P>
<P>
SHORTCAKES 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 cups granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 cup plus 3 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
2 (12-ounce) packages cranberries 
</P>
<P>
4 teaspoons very thin julienne-cut orange zest 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons cornstarch 
</P>
<P>
Several branches long-needled pine, optional 
</P>
<P>
Shortcakes 
</P>
<P>
Powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups whipping cream, whipped until just firm 
</P>
<P>
Combine granulated sugar with 1 cup water in large, heavy saucepan. Cook over 
medium heat, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add 6 cups cranberries, orange zest 
and cinnamon. Cook, stirring, 5 to 6 minutes or until berries pop. Remove pan 
from heat. 
</P>
<P>
Combine cornstarch with remaining 3 tablespoons water and stir mixture along 
with remaining 2 cups cranberries into cooked berries. Cook, stirring, until 
mixture has thickened, 2 to 3 minutes or longer. Remove from heat and let cool 
to room temperature. (Cranberry mixture can be prepared up to 2 days ahead. 
When cool, cover and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using.) 
</P>
<P>
Arrange pine sprigs on 10 dessert plates. For each serving, split 2 Shortcakes 
and place bottoms on plate. Ladle cranberry mixture over each half and place 
tops on slightly askew. Dust tops with powdered sugar. Serve immediately. Pass 
whipped cream separately in bowl. Makes 10 servings of 2 shortcakes each. 
</P>
<P>
Note: To toast pecans, place coarsely chopped nuts on rimmed baking sheet and 
bake at 350 degrees until crisp, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove and cool. 
</P>
<P>
Shortcakes 
</P>
<P>
2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup shortening, well-chilled and cut into 1/2-inch chunks 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and still warm 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup toasted chopped pecans 
</P>
<P>
Combine flour, sugar and baking powder in large mixing bowl. With pastry 
blender or 2 dinner knives, cut shortening into dry ingredients until mixture 
resembles oats. Make well in center and pour in milk and butter, stirring with 
fork until dough just holds together. Stir in pecans and mix well. 
</P>
<P>
Place dough on lightly floured work surface and knead 7 to 8 times until dough 
is smooth and no longer sticky. Reflour surface, then roll dough into 1/2-inch 
thick circle. Using 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter, cut out 20 shortcakes and place 
on ungreased baking sheet. Bake at 450 degrees on center shelf until golden and 
puffed, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Shortcakes can be baked 
several hours ahead and kept loosely covered with foil at room temperature.

FOUR CHEFS SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE HOLIDAY MEALS WITH LOTS OF FLAVOR AND VERY 
LITTLE FAT.; 
</P>
<P>
IS THIS ANY TIME TO BE THINKING LIGHT?; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAYS: FOUR RENOWNED L.A. CHEFS SAY 'YES' WITH FANTASTIC LOW-FAT FEASTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A magnificent crown roast. Creamy mounds of mashed potatoes. Aromatic mincemeat 
pie perfumed with spices. This is the time of year when tables sag beneath the 
weight of sumptuous feasts. It is the time of generous holiday dinners, when we 
expect -- and want -- food to taste especially rich. This is not the time to 
even think about lean or light or low-fat fare. Or is it? 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible to get through the holidays without wreaking havoc on your diet? 
Can eating right be every bit as delicious as eating wrong? The Times asked 
four well-known restaurant chefs to develop holiday menus using a minimum of 
fat. We suspected that even the experts would find it difficult to create a 
harmonious balance between food that is good for you and food that tastes 
wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
We were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Menus like these are great examples of how you can have wonderful, flavorful 
food that just happens to be healthy," said Evelyn Tribole, the registered 
dietitian who helped develop the market basket of limited fats. "It shows that 
low fat doesn't mean you have to choose between alfalfa sprouts and chocolate 
cream pie at the Christmas dinner table." 
</P>
<P>
Take Patrick Clark of Bice Ristorante. "We spare no amounts of butter," Clark 
says of the Christmas dinner he cooks for his wife and four children. Though 
the restaurant features dishes such as cheese-stuffed ravioli in walnut sauce 
and scallops in a lobster-saffron broth, the Clark Christmas table reflects 
Southern hospitality at its finest: roast beef, ham and turkey, plus chestnut 
and oyster stuffing and sweet potatoes. "It's very ethnic, hearty, hefty food," 
Clark says, "and a lot of it." 
</P>
<P>
But Clark had no trouble coming up with a wonderful holiday menu that 
restricted the fat to 30%. His menu reflects his affection for lavish food, and 
you'd never know that the thick, smoky celery root soup is made with no cream 
(rice is the trick) and just a single strip of bacon. You couldn't feel 
deprived after feasting on pheasant, couscous with pumpkin and pine nuts and a 
wonderful warm pear compote. Less than 30% fat? Nobody would ever know it. 
</P>
<P>
When Tony Di Lembo of Indigo reminisces about Christmas at home, he remembers 
how well his family ate. "When I was a kid, we had a traditional non-meat day 
before Christmas Day," he says. He recalls eating some "pretty weird stuff." 
The Christmas menu in his Italian home often centered entirely around fish: an 
octopus salad or eels sauced with olive oil, garlic and perhaps some fresh 
tomato. "My grandmother used to buy live eels and she would keep them alive. 
I'd peer over the sink and see these live eels swishing around." 
</P>
<P>
With this background, it's not surprising that Di Lembo had no trouble coming 
up with a festive holiday menu that is only around 30% fat. His salad is tossed 
with walnuts and just enough Roquefort to torque up the flavors; there's a 
simple, but far from ordinary grilled breast of chicken served with a zesty 
cranberry-pear chutney and a truly spicy corn-and-wild-rice salad. By dessert 
time, you're grateful for the cool simplicity of the fresh-squeezed orange 
juice gelatin. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Clark and Di Lembo, brothers Toribio and Javier Prado of Cha Cha Cha and 
Prado Restaurant were raised vegetarian; they learned early to appreciate the 
advantage of eating light -- even at Christmastime. "We ate mostly grains and 
pasta and a lot of fruit and nuts," says Toribio. 
</P>
<P>
Their menu of low-fat party foods is notable not only for its good taste but 
also for its extraordinary eye appeal; this is very pretty food. It starts with 
a spectacular salad made of colorful grilled vegetables and goes on to Cornish 
hens served with a sauce made of papaya, pineapple, cranberries and herbs. The 
side dish, a colorful counterpoint of rice and beans, adds substance. For 
dessert there is a fruit "flan" flavored with vanilla and colored with 
pomegranate juice. Their menu is less than 25% fat -- but this is entirely 
festive food.

HOW THEY GOT SO LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"Basically, people throw themselves into the holidays, using it as a license to 
overeat," says Evelyn Tribole, a registered dietitian. "The meals get bigger 
and fattier, and there are holiday goodies everywhere -- at the office in desk 
drawers or on table tops at home. People figure that come January they will go 
on their famous annual diet. That is not a good idea because it usually doesn't 
work, and there is an easier way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Since the typical holiday menu can contain as many as 2,000 calories and half 
of those can come from fat, eating half as much is a reasonable goal. On a 
1,000-calorie plan, you're allowed 33 grams of fat. 
</P>
<P>
This is the requirement we asked the chefs to follow in developing a lighter 
holiday menu: Each of the following ingredients is equal to 1 teaspoon of fat; 
the chefs were allowed 6 to 7 teaspoons of fat per person. Outside of these 
restrictions, the chefs were free to select any items they desired. 
</P>
<P>
* 1 teaspoon butter, regular margarine, shortening or oil, including olive oil 
</P>
<P>
* 1 tablespoon diet margarine 
</P>
<P>
* 1 teaspoon mayonnaise 
</P>
<P>
* 1 tablespoon diet mayonnaise 
</P>
<P>
* 1/8th avocado 
</P>
<P>
* 6 whole almonds 
</P>
<P>
* 10 large or 20 small peanuts 
</P>
<P>
* 1 tablespoon hazelnuts, sunflower seeds or pine nuts 
</P>
<P>
* 2 whole pecans or walnuts 
</P>
<P>
* 2 teaspoons pumpkin seeds 
</P>
<P>
* 1 slice bacon 
</P>
<P>
* 2 tablespoons shredded coconut 
</P>
<P>
* 2 tablespoons sour cream 
</P>
<P>
* 1 tablespoon whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
* 1/2 cup whole milk 
</P>
<P>
* 1 tablespoon cream cheese 
</P>
<P>
* 1/4 ounce salt pork 
</P>
<P>
* 1/3 ounce unsweetened chocolate 
</P>
<P>
* 1 tablespoon chocolate pieces 
</P>
<P>
* 1 ounce low-fat cheese such as Lifetime, Weight Watchers 
</P>
<P>
* 1/2 ounce hard or semisoft cheese 
</P>
<P>
* 1 tablespoon regular salad dressing such as blue cheese, Russian, Thousand 
Island, French or Italian 
</P>
<P>
* 2 tablespoons reduced-calorie salad dressing 
</P>
<P>
* 10 medium olives

EATING RIGHT: CUTTING FAT OUT OF OLD-FASHIONED CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Eating Right: How can I serve a Christmas meal that includes the 
traditional foods my family is accustomed to without all the fat that we 
usually have? 
</P>
<P>
 -- ROBERTA KINGSLEY 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
Dear Roberta: If your holiday menu is like the average one -- roast meat with 
butter-based gravy, lots of creamy vegetables and rich desserts, plus all the 
snack foods -- as much as half of the calories can come from fat. 
</P>
<P>
One obvious way to cut down on fat and calories in meat courses is to eat just 
three ounces of meat -- about the size of a deck of cards. Most people eat more 
than twice that amount at this time of year. Another idea is to roast poultry 
without the skin so that it looks delicious when served instead of removing the 
skin before eating. This makes diners feel deprived. 
</P>
<P>
Forget about packaged stuffing and pasta side dishes and make your own, using 
low-fat dairy products, fat-free substitutes or oil instead of butter and 
margarine, and ground turkey sausage instead of pork. Whole grains such as 
bulgur and couscous cooked with chicken or vegetable broths make unusual side 
dishes. If you do make dressing, cook it outside the bird so it doesn't soak up 
any fatty drippings. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert doesn't have to be radically lean either: It's OK to indulge in treats 
as long as the fat and calories have been reduced. Substitute raisins, chopped 
apples, dates and currants for high-fat ingredients such as chocolate and nuts, 
then dollop with whipped topping instead of whipped cream. Have a small serving 
of pumpkin pie instead of pecan, which can have almost twice the calories and 
fat. Sugar-free gelatin desserts and angel food cake are two less fattening 
dessert options. 
</P>
<P>
"Dieting is not a short-term thing," says Denise Rector, a registered dietitian 
and member of the American Heart Assn.'s Nutrition Committee, which each year 
develops a "Holidays a la Heart" menu brochure. "It's important to maintain 
healthy eating habits even at this time of year. Don't starve all week then 
splurge on the holidays," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The AHA brochure features recipes that can be put together entirely in advance 
or on the same day. The turkey dishes, for example, take just 10 minutes to 
prepare. The desserts are creamy and rich-tasting. "You won't compromise 
taste," Rector says.

RIGHT AT HOME;

<P>
WITH ITS SOPHISTICATED CROWD AND A DECOR THAT RESEMBLES GRANDMA'S PARLOR, THE 
LIVING ROOM IS PART COSMOPOLITAN, PART COZY COFFEEHOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANITA M. CAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the stylishly dressed young men and women who filled the intimate room 
were deep in conversation, oblivious to others around them. 
</P>
<P>
They lounged comfortably in cranberry-colored easy chairs, talking in hushed 
tones as cigarette smoke swirled around their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Gilt chandeliers cast subdued light over the late-night sophisticates as they 
calmly sipped dark-brown espresso or cappuccino from daintily crafted coffee 
cups. Everyone appeared to feel at home. 
</P>
<P>
An urbane dinner party in the style of Nick and Nora Charles? 
</P>
<P>
No, it's The Living Room, one of Los Angeles' hottest new coffeehouses. 
</P>
<P>
On any given day or night, coffeehouse connoisseurs can be found at the 
restaurant at 1st Street and La Brea Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
It's not so much the strong, tasty liquid that keeps them coming back, but the 
coffeehouse's distinct cosmopolitan atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most happening place in Los Angeles," said Chris Rutledge, 23, a 
co-manager. Robert Krass, who is co-owner of The Living Room with actress Ilona 
Margolis, said he tried to design the coffeehouse to be a place where patrons 
feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Krass, 28, said that when he returned to the United States after studying art 
at L'Ecole Des Beaux Arts in Switzerland, he missed the coffeehouses that serve 
as gathering places throughout Europe. Disappointed with more popular 
contemporary coffeehouses, he decided to bring in something new by recapturing 
something old. 
</P>
<P>
"When I designed it, I was thinking about Europe," Krass said. "There, cafes 
tend to be like home. Here, everything was sterile. The walls were white and 
the lines black. 
</P>
<P>
"In these places you feel like art. I don't want people to come here and feel 
like art. I want them to come, relax and have a cup of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
The name of the coffeehouse is apt. The overstuffed chairs and coffee tables 
look like they could have been taken from grandmother's parlor. The golden 
yellow walls are covered with ornately framed abstract art and mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the back of the room, a burgundy-colored carpet runs up a flight of 
stairs, leading to an open balcony from which one might expect to see Loretta 
Young descending. 
</P>
<P>
It's this detail that makes The Living Room special, Krass said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing like it in Los Angeles," he said. "The other coffeehouses 
seem to have spent less money and time in the decor. I've spent time making it 
special." 
</P>
<P>
Patrons of The Living Room say they like its laid-back atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here don't care what you look like or what you drive," said Melissa 
Everett, 21, who said other popular coffeehouses tend to be hoity-toity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's comfortable but chic," said Rodney Ebrahimian, 21, who lives in Beverly 
Hills and is a senior at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Like most patrons of The Living Room, Ebrahimian said he frequents many of the 
popular coffeehouses in Los Angeles. But he said The Living Room has something 
special that can't be duplicated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like getting a designer outfit and trying to change it and sell it. It 
won't be as good as the original," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coffeehouse patrons are mostly young (20 to about 35) and hip. Clothes range 
from torn jeans with designer sweaters or blazers to assorted all-black, 
no-name outfits. Lace also appears to be in. 
</P>
<P>
Regular Dean Barrington, 28, said that if he had to describe the coffeehouse 
clientele to someone else, he'd tell them "it seems to be a lot of actor 
wanna-bes." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed two patrons on a recent Thursday arrived at the coffeehouse, bought some 
coffee and curled up on one of the sofas to go over lines from a script, 
oblivious to the grinding of coffee beans in the background. 
</P>
<P>
But one woman who has passed the wanna-be stage was also there. Actress Daryl 
Hannah said it was her first time at the coffeehouse. She sat on a sofa and 
read the newspaper while she enjoyed her coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman sat in a corner with some coffee and a book, while three other 
women chatted at a table near the middle of the room. 
</P>
<P>
Most patrons at the coffeehouse concede that The Living Room is trendy, if not 
somewhat pretentious. But Krass contends that anything considered in fashion 
will inevitably be tagged as trendy. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing I can do about it because it attracts young celebrities," he 
said. "It's not a term I like." But "it seems to be the rule in Los Angeles 
that you're trendy or you die." 
</P>

<P>
Photo, The Living Room is modeled after coffeehouses that serve as gathering 
places throughout Europe. Ornate furnishings and plush couches are designed to 
make people feel comfortable, perhaps even as playful as co-owners Ilona 
Margolis and Robert Krass, above. LISA ROMEREIN / Los Angeles Times

AND ROOFTOPS WITH SEASONAL DISPLAYS.

Without looking at the calendar, Don and Joanne Kaplan's Agoura Hills neighbors 
know when Christmas is close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Just after Thanksgiving every year, the Kaplans' 21-year-old son, Drew, and his 
girlfriend, Gail Terrassi, begin wiring a few strings of outdoor mini-lights 
together. When the job is completed, more than 40,000 bulbs are in place -- not 
to mention Santa Claus, a full complement of reindeer, a plastic train, various 
toy soldiers and, just for a little something extra, a thick misty fog rolling 
out of the garage every five minutes. It's enough to make you wonder if a 
Disneyland Electric Light Parade float escaped from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"It started out just for our immediate family," Don Kaplan, 52, said. The 
family tradition, which began in Woodland Hills in 1980, continued when the 
Kaplans moved to Agoura Hills in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 display, designed by Drew, is the biggest to date, requiring more than 
200 extension cords and drawing close to 200 amps of electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1986 we started popping all our circuit breakers in the house," Don Kaplan 
said. "So I called in our electrician, and he suggested dedicating new circuits 
to the lights." At that time, the family was using about 7,800 lights a year. 
By 1987, the entire electrical system had to be upgraded to accommodate the 
ever-increasing seasonal load. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year we want to do something different," he said, pointing to the 
ground-hugging fog produced by a machine in the garage. "Next year we're having 
arches over the driveway, maybe another fog machine for the train." He stopped 
and looked around. "This is a ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive Christmas lighting displays of houses and in some cases, entire city 
blocks are in vogue again. Homes such as the Kaplans' are drawing interest not 
only from neighbors but from carloads of people from throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Monroe and her husband, Mike, turn their Northridge front lawn into a 
child's dream world of candy canes, snowmen, carolers and Santa Claus. A manger 
scene and a large cross are also on display. "We're just big kids," Diane said. 
"I'm 42 going on 16, and every year we try to add something new." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, she said, it was Santa Claus; this year, the cross. 
</P>
<P>
The Monroes begin dragging out the lights and decorations the Friday after 
Thanksgiving and keep everything burning brightly until after New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't cost much," she said. "This year's utility bill was about $20 more 
than last year. We love it and love doing it. We decorate for everything. If we 
aren't going to have fun doing it, we're not going to do it. Maybe I should do 
Halloween out here, too." 
</P>
<P>
Monte Markowitz of West Hills isn't thinking about Halloween, just the 5,000 
lights he and his family have just strung all over the front of the house and 
lawn, half of them hand-glued to the roof. 
</P>
<P>
"We celebrate both Hanukkah and Christmas in our house," said Markowitz, 37, 
pointing to the large menorah amid the snowman, toy soldiers and Santa Claus 
figures. A Star of David keeps the Christmas lights company on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
"Friends of mine live in Agoura, and we have a competition each year to see who 
can put the most lights up and do the nicest job possible," he said. "We do it 
for the kids, for fun, for the time of the year." 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, families convert entire streets into a celebration of lights. 
Laurel Creek Drive, for example, a short cul de sac in Valencia, shows what a 
neighborhood can do when Christmas is in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Each house interprets the holiday in its own way. A train runs around the 
perimeter of one front yard. Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus finally get a little rest 
in another. Nativity scenes abound, as do thousands of multicolored lights. At 
the end of the street, a large "Merry Christmas" makes sure every visitor knows 
the reason for the celebration. Carolers from a local school pay holiday 
visits, too. 
</P>
<P>
A well-lit Christmas started on Laurel Creek Drive in the early 1980s, 
homeowners said, when a few neighbors persuaded most of the people on the block 
to make something special. 
</P>
<P>
"One year we tried to make a snowman out of three tumbleweeds," said resident 
Susan Talbot, 39, who, with her husband, Stuart, take care of Mr. and Mrs. 
Claus and the reindeer. "We put them together, spray-painted them white, and it 
looked pretty good. Then it rained, and the paint washed away." 
</P>
<P>
This year, a large, bright yellow ribbon is tied to a tree in the Talbots' 
front yard for the troops in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
A visitor from England who is staying with friends on Laurel Creek Drive 
remarked, "This is my first American Christmas, and it's different." 
</P>
<P>
The British visitor, Christopher Morgan, 27, said: "Christmas is celebrated on 
a big scale back home, but not many people bother with so many lights outside 
their house. This is a great community spirit. You wouldn't get people in 
England driving around and looking at people's houses." 
</P>
<P>
Another cul de sac that specializes in lighting up all the houses is Masterson 
Court in nearby Saugus. About 20,000 lights crisscross the street from lamp 
post to lamp post, with snowmen, plastic soldiers, Santa Claus, reindeers, 
candy canes and gingerbread men on the various lawns. 
</P>
<P>
"It started about five years ago, and we've built up and added on every year," 
resident Kurt Birtell, 34, said. "Every year, everybody keeps on getting more 
and more into it. I don't think I could ever replace this block." 
</P>
<P>
Birtell said it takes him 55 hours each Christmas just to put up his 
decorations, and despite having to put in additional electrical circuits to 
handle the increased load, he said, everyone on the block feels it's worth all 
the preparation. 
</P>
<P>
"Every night there are more and more crowds. It's great. I don't even mind when 
I'm coming home from work and have to wait behind six or seven cars to get into 
my own driveway." 
</P>
<P>
Some say the annual decorations build neighborhood spirit. By way of example, 
Gary Henson, 34, told the story of the day he came home to Masterson Court with 
a stack of plywood. He cut out the patterns to make snowmen, other people 
painted them white, and still others added the eyes and hats. Finally, each had 
a snowman for the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
All agreed that the most difficult part is coping with the Santa Ana winds that 
always seem to blow this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind pulls wires down and breaks bulbs," said Diane Monroe. "Every night 
you come out and replace bulbs." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to really wire everything securely," said Don Kaplan, "but the wind 
will still occasionally blow down the reindeer or the lines out of a tree." 
</P>
<P>
But nobody really complains too loudly. The crowds of awe-struck visitors more 
than make up for any technical problems, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"The adults stand here and look just as much as the children," said Nathleen 
Bruno, 64, of Laurel Creek Drive. "It's fun for everyone. They make an excuse 
that they're taking the kids, but they want to come themselves." 
</P>
<P>
"It's my way of saying to everyone in the neighborhood and the children, 'Happy 
Holidays,' " Don Kaplan said. "We're happy the season is here, and we want 
everyone else to join in and share it with us."

TEDDY BEARS BRING OUT THE KID IN ADULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
What hobby brings love, profit and a world of make-believe? Teddy bears. 
</P>
<P>
Teddy collectors make bears, sell bears and save to buy particular bears they 
love. One couple paid the biggest price ever -- $86,350 -- for an early 1900 
Steiff bear. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary and Paul Volpp had no idea the bidding would go that high at the 1989 
Sotheby auction in London. In celebration of their 42 years of marriage, they 
named the precious beauty "Happy Anniversary." 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary says, "Her shining eyes begged me to take her home." Now "Happy" is a 
member of the 4,000-bear Volpp collection in Buena Park and will be a featured 
model in their beautifully illustrated bear books. 
</P>
<P>
The German-made Steiff, according to collectors, is the Rolls-Royce of bears. 
Antiques and some bears created by artists do increase in value, but that's not 
the reason most people collect bears. People collect things that bring warm 
memories, and bears have an almost human appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The smile can be wimpy, the eyes too close together and the coat matted. 
Someone will buy him because "he needs me." 
</P>
<P>
Today bear-mania has touched half a million people, and the hobby ranks fourth 
in the United States, after coins, stamps and dolls. 
</P>
<P>
"Bears are not just art, but heart," said Ron Block from Edinburgh Imports in 
Calabasas. "They are an extension of yourself, something to love. I know two 
women who make bears for handicapped children, furry pets that duplicate the 
child's own disability. Policemen, firefighters and doctors use teddy bears to 
comfort worried kids." 
</P>
<P>
Block and his German wife, Elke -- a Steiff bear collector -- own a warehouse 
filled with glass eyeballs, joints, fur fabrics and anything else you need to 
make bears. Their artist customers come from all over the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Ann Baxter, a Glendale collector, met with 13 bear lovers and founded 
Bear Enthusiast's All 'Round -- B.E.A.R. -- Collectors Club. Now it has more 
than 400 members. On the first Wednesday of each month, bear lovers travel from 
Santa Barbara, Ventura, Oxnard, Buena Park and other communities for a dinner 
meeting in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
As you walk into the banquet room, the furry stars are everywhere, bedecked in 
ruffles, funny hats, a new tuxedo. Most of the owners are adults, and many even 
have grown children, perhaps grandchildren. A jovial member admits, "Bears wake 
up the little kid in us, and give us a chance to play make-believe." 
</P>
<P>
A hum of voices sounds. "We drove a thousand miles out of our way to find the 
Baltimore Bear Shop." . . . "In Vermont the Hugging Bear Inn is having their 
annual bear wedding." . . . "What do you think about this panda? Are the 
markings right?" 
</P>
<P>
In one corner of the room, bears compete in miniature scenes suiting the theme 
of the month. The winner is a rakish fellow in red striped pajamas, waiting 
impatiently for a primping cinnamon bride dressed in a silk and lace peignoir. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly raffles support two of the club's favorite charities: Five Acres, a 
home for abused children, and Para Los Ninos, a day-care center for Skid Row 
children. The ninos have received 85 bears, and at Five Acres a big birthday 
Bruin grants wishes for all the children, from ages 2 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
"Bears are the great equalizers," Ann Baxter says. "Housewives, plumbers, 
professors, nurses -- we are all alike when we share something we love." Then 
she adds more pensively, "People need a time to share happiness." 
</P>
<P>
In spring and fall, B.E.A.R. sponsors a fair at Glendale Civic Auditorium, with 
more than 100 booths of bears. Each exhibiting artist has a personal style or 
mark. A Steiff bear has a button in the left ear. You can recognize Cindy 
Martin's bears because of their long, floppy limbs and high-bridged noses. 
</P>
<P>
Touch the fur. Is it real mink? It could be mohair. Most bear makers choose 
from furs and a variety of synthetics. Clothes, furniture, even toys for bears 
can be found at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
One client, a businessman from New York, bought "Poinsettia" from Carol 
Jarosik, a bear artist from Agoura Hills. The white ultra-plush bear with her 
red satin bow was packed in a plastic bag. The red-flowered paw pads poked out 
of the handles, and bright gray eyes peered over the top. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't cover her face," instructed Carol gently. "She doesn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
"No need to worry." The man's bald head bent over the little bear. He gave her 
a gentle pat. "I have 600 more at home. Bears cover every baseboard in my 
house." 
</P>
<P>
Carol understood. Her own house is one big hug of bears, not only those she has 
made, with hand-painted paw pads, but hundreds she and her husband, Tony, have 
collected. Bears peek around the stair rails or ride in a tall pram with 
lavender velvet cushions. Mabel -- a rotund beige softy -- languishes in the 
family rocker. 
</P>
<P>
"She came to visit and decided to stay." Carol nods lovingly at the bear, whose 
blue satin pillbox hat is held by a tiny hatpin. A crocheted collar protects 
her shoulders, and a satin evening bag dangles from one paw. 
</P>
<P>
Mabel watches a frisky polar bear peeking out from under a wagon and listens to 
the bear-buzz about "Killer," a hunched brown husky in black leather vest and 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really a marshmallow," confides Carol. "Even the skull on his jacket has 
a silly grin." She adds, " 'Killer' won a blue ribbon at the fair in Nevada 
City, and the funniest thing happened. A woman passed my booth several times, 
then stopped and said, 'He looks exactly like my husband!' " 
</P>
<P>
The buyer continued, "My husband is a woodcarver. He'll love this bear." A few 
weeks later she mailed pictures of Killer astride his own hand-carved 
motorcycle, complete with spike wheels and travel pack. 
</P>
<P>
The Jarosiks and other bear lovers follow the state and national fairs. The 
biggest bear conclave is at Disney World. Last year those attending built 
"Yankee Doodle," the world's largest bear -- 24 feet high, seated. The 1990 
Walt Disney World Teddy Bear and Doll Show Nov. 29 to Dec. 2 attracted Raikes, 
Steiff and other well-known artists who designed bears for the event and sold 
replicas and copies of "Happy Anniversary," with part of the proceeds 
designated for children's hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Jarosiks, thousands of other bear-lovers who attended left their bears 
behind but camehome bringing, guess what -- more bears. 
</P>
<P>
 The B.E.A.R. Club meets the first Wednesday of every month for dinner at 
Pickwick Banquet and Entertainment Center, 1001 Riverside Drive, Burbank. 
Guests are welcome; $17, including dinner. Members, $15. For reservations, call 
(818) 994-7845.

DIVISION OF LOT APPROVED

<TEXT>
<P>
A bid to increase the salability of a lot containing a vacant Gemco department 
store, a Unocal service station and 771 empty parking spaces has won City 
Council approval. 
</P>
<P>
The council Tuesday voted unanimously approve an application by the landowner, 
La Puente-Beverly Road Assn., to divide the lot into three parcels, one large 
and two small. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Hartmann, the city's planning and community development director, said 
subdividing the lot will encourage prospective buyers by increasing the 
flexibility of development. 
</P>
<P>
The Gemco store has been vacant since late 1986, and the gas station is the 
only business operating on the 12.83-acre site along Hacienda Boulevard north 
of Francisquito Avenue.

is the first Municipal Court judge to receive the award, the spokesman said. 
Cherness has been on the Culver City municipal bench since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
John Yzurdiaga of the association said Cherness was noted for being fair and 
gentlemanly, as well as showing concern for the defendants who come before him.

GAIN, or Greater Avenues for Independence, is California's response to a 1986 
federal requirement for educational and vocational training programs for those 
receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Parents with children 
younger than 3 who have been getting AFDC for more than three years are 
eligible for education and job training under the GAIN program, which has a 
$360-million budget this year. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's GAIN program is one of three intermediaries in Los Angeles County 
that contract with schools and social service agencies to provide the training. 
The other two are the county Department of Community and Senior Citizens 
Services and the city of Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
County GAIN administrators set a goal of helping about 2,800 of the county's 
115,000 eligible welfare recipients, but none of the three intermediaries has 
met that goal. 
</P>
<P>
Among the problems shared by all three intermediaries, officials cite a 
$7.9-million cap the state placed on the county's share of the program after 
objecting to the county's use of a private company to screen applicants. That 
limited the number of people who could be screened, said Patricia Wilson, a 
GAIN program administrator with the Los Angeles Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 65% of those applying need basic education before they can 
continue on to vocational training, Wilson said. Thus, only 551 people have 
completed vocational training in the county since the program began, according 
to state statistics through August. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pasadena doesn't seem to be in worse shape than the others, it has 
been the subject of constant turmoil and has been headed by an acting 
administrator since it began in 1987. With no permanent head, the program hired 
just three of the five staffers it was allowed and has aided fewer than 150 
people. It originally was to have 19 staffers and help 944 people. 
</P>
<P>
Deweylene Henry, as head of the city Community Services and Employment 
Development Department, encouraged the city to seek the GAIN program, to be 
administered under her department. In an unrelated dispute with city 
administrators, she was removed last year from her job as department head. 
</P>
<P>
Henry, who is black, has since sued the city, alleging racial and sexual 
discrimination. The city has declined to comment on Henry's suit. She is 
currently on medical leave. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Anderson succeeded her as head of the Community Services and Employment 
Development Department and thus oversaw acting GAIN Administrator Tom Haywood. 
Anderson was demoted and Haywood was suspended after an incident last month 
involving unauthorized access to questions for an interview for the job of 
permanent administrator. Haywood was one of eight applicants for the job. 
</P>
<P>
The incident has put the search for a permanent administrator on hold, said 
Ramon Curiel, city human resources director. It has also prompted Haywood, who 
is gay, to file a grievance accusing the city of discrimination against gays. 
City officials said they are unaware of any discrimination or anti-gay 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a permanent administrator in Pasadena concerns county GAIN 
administrators but, so far, has not affected the office's performance, said 
Chloe Dauncey, the county contract administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The other two Los Angeles intermediaries have permanent staff members. The 
county department of Community and Senior Citizens Services hired its four GAIN 
employees two years ago, GAIN Coordinator Mary Kohler said. Her department has 
handled more than half of the 551 in the county who completed vocational 
training, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since May, the city of Inglewood has had five GAIN employees, with three other 
city employees working part time for GAIN, said Rhetta Alexander, the city's 
employment services manager. She said Inglewood had handled fewer GAIN 
participants than the county Community and Senior Citizens Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, most city officials have avoided commenting on GAIN. City Director 
Rick Cole said most of the program's troubles were beyond city control. 
</P>
<P>
"If I thought GAIN was going great guns every place else but Pasadena I'd be 
more concerned," he said. "But the whole program has gotten off to a slow 
start." 
</P>
<P>
City Director William Paparian said he questioned the city's ability to manage 
GAIN from the beginning. The recent changes in personnel simply renew that 
concern, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But City Manager Philip Hawkey said the GAIN program can still reach its 
potential. "It was anticipated to be a significant activity, much larger than 
what it has been," Hawkey said. "But it may well be on its way to reaching the 
larger scope."

<P>
University High School student Anna Liceica is celebrating this holiday season 
with a plum role. In fact, she is dancing the demanding role of the Sugar Plum 
Fairy in the Westside Ballet's annual production of "The Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, I didn't really want to learn ballet, but my mother thought 
I would like it," Liceica said. "And now I love it." 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 10, Liceica began studying ballet at the National School of 
Ballet in her native Romania. She danced in several performances at the school 
and with the State Opera Ballet Company. And in 1986 and 1988, she took first 
prize in Romania's National Competition of Arts and Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Liceica, now 15, moved to the United States this year and lives in West Los 
Angeles with her family. After classes, she spends four to five hours a day 
practicing ballet. 
</P>
<P>
"I practice every day except Sundays with the barre, ballet classes, variations 
and rehearsals," she said. Liceica hopes to graduate early from high school and 
pursue a career as a professional ballerina in New York. "I love dancing," she 
said. "I'm trying hard to get there." The Nutcracker will be performed at 2 and 
7:30 p.m. today at the Lincoln Auditorium in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Burns, a professor of history at UCLA, has established the Premio del 
Rey, a book prize for Spanish history. 
</P>
<P>
Burns will fund the book award with money he has earned from research on the 
history of Spain. The first Premio del Rey award will be presented this month 
at a meeting of the American Historical Assn., which will administer the $1,000 
prize on a biannual basis. Burns is a resident of Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
The Rabbi Jacob Pressman Academy of Temple Beth Am honored Charles and Rose 
Pilch as recipients of the first Etz Chaim Education Award for Distinguished 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilches were honored for their support for the growth and development of 
the academy and quality in Jewish education. 
</P>
<P>
The John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA has named Edward 
Leamer, an international economist, to the Chauncey J. Medberry Chair. Rakesh 
Sarin, an operations and technology management professor, has been appointed to 
the Paine Chair. 
</P>
<P>
Leamer, acclaimed for his studies of international public policy issues, will 
teach business economics courses. 
</P>
<P>
Sarin is a researcher in the area of decision making under risk and ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
Zack Gochin has been chosen as the grand prize winner of the American Cancer 
Society's 15th annual Great American Smokeout Bookmark Contest for the coastal 
cities unit. 
</P>
<P>
His entry will be reproduced on 10,000 bookmarks and 5,000 posters that will be 
distributed throughout Los Angeles County.

ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY BUCKS TREND, GEARS FOR EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hooray for Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
That's the song some commercial real estate brokers and developers are singing 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, law firms, accounting offices and banks seemed to be filling 
almost endless blocks of new office space. The trend has been slowing -- along 
with the economy -- and many in the real estate business find themselves 
saddled with too much supply and not enough demand. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a different story for the entertainment industry, which, stronger than 
ever, is driving some of the biggest development and lease deals in Los Angeles 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every movie studio in town is planning an expansion, and many smaller 
production, management, consulting and distribution companies are in the market 
to lease or buy sizable chunks of commercial space. 
</P>
<P>
At entertainment enclaves such as Universal City, Maple Plaza in Beverly Hills 
and selected buildings in Burbank's Media District, for example, there's 
virtually no space available, and landlords have waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
"The entertainment industry is one sector of the economy that hasn't suffered a 
downturn," said Robert Waller, a broker at Coldwell Banker Commercial Real 
Estate, Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime office tenants in Hollywood want to lease space all over town, Waller 
said, and many companies are shopping for small industrial facilities that can 
be bought at a favorable price in today's market. 
</P>
<P>
Helping fuel these relocations is an undersupply of quality space in Hollywood, 
said Les Small, president of Entertainment Realty Corp. in Century City. "Lack 
of redevelopment in Hollywood has forced entertainment firms to go elsewhere," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's been almost 20 years since the construction of any major new office 
buildings in Hollywood. With many entertainment companies acutely in need of 
elbow room, Small said, "we can't find good-quality space in Hollywood at any 
price." 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the many real estate ventures of the entertainment industry: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Walt Disney Co. has been so active in development over the last five 
years that some critics have assailed its projects as symbolic of a 
"Disneyization" of architecture. 
</P>
<P>
In Burbank, the company recently completed a 320,000-square-foot headquarters 
building complete with 19-foot-high dwarfs holding up the roof. Now the 
entertainment giant hopes to add another 1.15 million square feet of space on 
its 44-acre lot. 
</P>
<P>
Disney wants quick approval of its new development plan by Burbank city 
officials. The company hopes to avoid any building constraints that could be 
imposed with the passage of Measure 2 -- a growth-limiting initiative set to 
appear on Burbank's February ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Office space continues to be in short supply for Disney and its various units. 
</P>
<P>
The company recently signed a lease with CMS Development to occupy a 
115,000-square-foot building under construction at Olive Avenue and Buena Vista 
Street in Burbank. The new Carnation Building in Glendale opened its doors in 
November 94% preleased -- thanks in part to a 98,000-square-foot lease by Walt 
Disney Imagineering. 
</P>
<P>
All told, Disney has leased, subleased or preleased more than 500,000 square 
feet of commercial space in the last 12 months, reported Julien J. Studley Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, both Anaheim and Long Beach are in the running for yet another theme 
park. Port Disney, a $2-billion, marine-inspired creation on 350 acres in Long 
Beach, could include five new hotels, restaurants, various tourist attractions 
and a marina. 
</P>
<P>
 -- NBC and Cushman Investment &amp; Development Corp. are planning the 
790,000-square-foot NBC Plaza office complex in Burbank. Cushman previously 
developed the nearby Disney Channel Building. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and its parent, Sony, are proposing a 
15-year building plan in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia wants to expand the 1.53 million square feet of commercial space on 
its 44.7-acre lot along Washington Boulevard to about 2.5 million square feet 
by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
The Culver City Planning Commission and Redevelopment Agency are considering 
whether to approve the project -- which would include twin nine-story office 
buildings, small landscaped parks, a 19th-Century Town Square and new sound 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
And Columbia is swapping space it now occupies on the Warner Bros. lot in 
Burbank with Lorimar Television, which, in turn, is leaving the Columbia lot in 
Culver City and is relocating to the Warner lot. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tri-Star Inc. will fill some of the space left by Lorimar at the 
Columbia lot. 
</P>
<P>
If all this isn't confusing enough, Columbia has plenty of other offices 
scattered throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The company occupies big chunks of space at Sunset-Gower Studios in Hollywood 
and in Studio Plaza at 3400 Riverside Drive in Burbank, just across the street 
from Warner Bros. That building, which will serve as corporate headquarters for 
Columbia, is owned by Columbia's former owner, the Coca-Cola Co. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few blocks away, Columbia is filling 45,000 square feet of space at 
MCA's One Lakeside Plaza in Universal City. The recently signed lease is valued 
at about $7.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets quite expensive running multiple locations," said Kenneth S. Williams, 
senior vice president of finance and administration at Columbia. That, he said, 
makes it imperative for the company to expand in Culver City and consolidate 
what he described as "far-flung" operations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Warner Bros. Inc. is still contemplating what to do with space being 
vacated at its Burbank studio by Columbia. No final plans have been announced, 
but some construction at the studio is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Paramount Pictures on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood is not talking about a 
rumored 250,000-square-foot office tower on its lot. The studio has been buying 
adjacent properties over the last year in anticipation of an expansion. Just 
how soon any of this will happen is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Currently under construction at Paramount's lot, though, is a 
55,000-square-foot office building to house the company's domestic television 
division and its planning and development units. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fox Inc. wants to add 771,000 square feet of new construction to its 
54-acre lot in Century City. The plan is to expand the studio from its current 
1.1 million square feet of space and move some of the Fox operations now in 
Hollywood at Metromedia's property. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents will want their say before any final plans are made, however. 
Accordingly, Fox has begun a public relations campaign to win the support of 
growth-control groups such as Friends of Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MCA Development Co. of Universal City is building City Walk -- a 
200,000-square-foot retail/entertainment complex worth about $100 million. MCA 
is also rebuilding the structures lost in a spectacular election night fire. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, MCA paid about $11.25 million for 360 of its 420-acre holdings in 
Universal City. Today, it's worth an untold fortune. Universal City's 1.5 
million square feet of office space is reportedly 100% occupied. 
</P>
<P>
MCA has ample room for expansion, and Wall Street analysts have long maintained 
that the company's landholdings represent a strong opportunity to enhance MCA 
shareholder value. The fate of any such expansion may now be in the hands of 
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Raleigh Studios recently completed a six-year expansion in Hollywood with 
three new buildings along Melrose Avenue. A spokesman reported the studio is 
looking to buy more property, since its rented facilities are more than 95% 
occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tribune California Properties (a unit of Tribune Broadcasting) is in the 
midst of planning a four-phase development for its Hollywood property at 5800 
W. Sunset Blvd. The 10.21-acre site is home to KTLA, KMPC, Grant Tribune 
Productions and Tribune Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
If Tribune gets its way, the new construction would begin on a 600-car parking 
lot, a 20-story, 324,000-square-foot office tower, four new sound stages, and 
finally, a 16-story, 332,000-square-foot office tower. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Hollywood Center Studios on North Las Palmas Avenue, work is expected to 
commence within the next six months on a 40,000-square-foot office building. 
New stages are also being contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pathe Communications Corp. plans to make its home at 6420 Wilshire Blvd., 
adjacent to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-story building was bought in September for a reported $24 million by an 
affiliate of Pathe and an affiliate of Arden Investment Group -- headed by 
Victor J. Coleman and Richard S. Ziman, managing partner of Pacific Financial 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe -- which recently acquired MGM/UA Communications -- plans to completely 
remodel the Wilshire Boulevard tower. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the William Morris Agency is completing the William Morris Rodeo 
Building in Beverly Hills. This is the third office building developed and 
owned by the talent agency within a two-block radius. The newest building was 
built for investment purposes and is being marketed to other entertainment 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
For those entertainment companies with neither the land nor the interest nor 
the funds to build or buy new space, there's always the option of leasing. 
</P>
<P>
The J.H. Snyder Co. has created a new enclave of entertainment tenants in the 
Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles with such buildings as Museum Square, the 
Wilshire Courtyard, the soon-to-be rehabbed Cal Fed Building and a new office 
tower slated for development.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: IF THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS DESIRABLE, DON'T MOVE BUT REMODEL 
INSTEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We own a three-bedroom, one-bathroom home in a nice neighborhood 
where the schools are excellent. Our problem is we have three children and our 
home is too crowded now that they are getting older and each wants their own 
bedroom. We have looked at larger homes but they seem so expensive in the 
school district where we want our kids. 
</P>
<P>
The larger new homes are out in the boondocks and the schools there are 
overcrowded, so we have ruled out a brand-new house. Our alternative is to add 
on a bedroom, bathroom, and family room to our present home. But we realize the 
construction would be very inconvenient, and the cost estimates seem so high. 
If we add on to our present home, any suggestions on the best way to finance 
the improvements? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Perhaps you've noticed the boom in home remodeling. Many other 
homeowners have come to the same conclusion that it is usually best to remodel 
and add on to a presently owned home rather than buy a larger one. Since you 
like the location and school district of your current home, I agree you will be 
making a wise decision to upgrade it. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there will be considerable inconvenience during construction. But an 
experienced and thoughtful contractor can minimize the disruptions. Be sure to 
get bids and client references from at least three remodeling contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Don't necessarily go for the lowest bid. Check the quality of their work and 
talk to their previous customers to see what they liked best and least about 
each contractor. 
</P>
<P>
As for financing the construction, you can either use a home equity loan or 
refinance your current mortgage with a new first mortgage after the work is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
The cheapest and easiest finance choice is usually to obtain a home-equity 
credit line to finance construction. After the work is finished, then you can 
decide if you want to refinance the first mortgage with a new one, possibly at 
a lower interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Over 55' Exemption Can't Reduce New Basis 
</P>
<P>
Q: I want to sell my expensive home and buy a less costly property, and I want 
to use the "over 55 rule" $125,000 tax exemption to reduce the basis of my new 
home. I can sell my current home for about $350,000 and I want to buy a 
replacement for around $300,000. Can I use the $125,000 exemption to reduce the 
basis on my new home? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. I am not aware of any method of doing so. You can use your 
once-per-lifetime $125,000 exemption by subtracting it from the net (adjusted) 
sales price of your old home. That would bring your $350,000 sales price down 
to $225,000. If you buy a replacement home costing at least $225,000 in this 
example, then your profit tax is deferred. But the basis of your replacement 
home is not reduced by the amount of your $125,000 exemption. Please consult 
your tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elderly Can Minimize Down Payment Too 
</P>
<P>
Q: You constantly harp on making a small down payment and getting a big 
mortgage when buying a home. Does that advice also apply to old folks? I am 74 
and my husband is 79. We are both in good health and plan to buy a small home 
in central Florida near Orlando. Is there any place we can get a 20-year 
mortgage at our ages? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, even retirees should make a minimum down payment and obtain a maximum 
home loan. Mortgage lenders cannot discriminate on the basis of age. They must 
judge your loan application on your income and credit history. 
</P>
<P>
Even though you are unlikely to live to pay off a 30-year mortgage, if your 
income and credit justify it, you can obtain such a loan. Florida mortgage 
lenders are especially savvy to the merits of making loans to older people 
because the default rate is practically zero. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aunt's Conditional Gift of Deed Proves Void 
</P>
<P>
Q: In 1982 my aunt gave me the deed to her house. She told me to have it 
recorded after she died. Last month she died. I then recorded the deed at the 
court house. But the attorney for her estate says my deed is void because it 
wasn't recorded before she died. Is this correct? 
</P>
<P>
A: To be valid, a deed must be delivered to the grantee unconditionally before 
the grantor's death. It appears the deed you received in 1982 was conditional 
in that you could not record it until your aunt died. That means the estate's 
attorney is correct and the house still belongs to your late aunt's estate. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the deed had been delivered to you unconditionally and you had 
recorded it before your aunt died, then title to the house would be yours. 
Please consult a local real estate attorney for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cash Not Required to Retain Tax Deferment 
</P>
<P>
Q: We were very fortunate to sell our home last year for cash. Now we want to 
buy a new house. The builder offers a plan with as little as 10% down payment. 
However, I am wondering if we have to reinvest the cash we received from our 
home sale if we are to avoid paying tax on our sale profit. Please clarify. 
</P>
<P>
A: Internal Revenue Code 1034, the "rollover residence replacement rule," does 
not require you to reinvest any cash from your home sale into your replacement 
home. All that matters is you must buy and occupy the replacement principal 
residence within 24 months before or after the sale and its cost must equal or 
exceed the net (adjusted) sales price of your old home. 
</P>
<P>
To use an extreme example, you can sell your old home for cash and buy a 
replacement home of equal or greater cost for nothing down, as with a VA 
mortgage, and spend the tax-deferred cash from your home sale as you wish. For 
further details, please consult your tax adviser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When Hints Fail, Have Neighbor's Grass Cut 
</P>
<P>
Q: My next door neighbor has let her home run down badly. It hasn't been 
painted in years and the lawn is never mowed. In a nice way I have talked with 
her about this, and she realizes the problems, but refuses to do anything about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The lady is quite wealthy, owns her home free and clear, drives a fairly new 
car and dresses nicely, but she refuses to keep up her house. As a result, I am 
afraid if I sell my house the value will be impaired. Is there any solution to 
this problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: The best you can do is keep up your home and ask your other neighbors to do 
likewise. I once had a similar problem with a neighbor across the street. One 
day while she was away I mowed her front lawn and made her yard look sharp. She 
got the message and kept up her yard after that. Realizing such action may be 
an illegal trespass, you may want to consider a similar tactic or volunteer to 
mow the neighbor's lawn with her permission. 
</P>

How Safe Are 'Seller- Financed' Home Sales?

Q: Just a quick thank you note for your advice last year to carry back the 
mortgage when we sold our home which had been on the market about six months. 
The first week our realty agent ran an ad for "seller financing" we received 
two offers. 
</P>
<P>
Everything worked out very well. We enjoy earning 10% interest which is higher 
than we can get elsewhere. Thanks to this installment sale our retirement 
income is higher than we planned. But my husband keeps saying he hopes our 
buyers default, so we can foreclose and get the house back to sell for a second 
profit. What are the odds of that happening? 
</P>
<P>
A: Less than 1% of home mortgages go to foreclosure sales each year, so your 
chances of foreclosing are virtually nil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use Credit Check to Repel 'Sharks' 
</P>
<P>
Q: About two years ago we decided to sell our home without a real estate 
broker. A young "shark" buyer took advantage of us because we didn't know what 
we were doing. He got us down in price and convinced us to carry back a second 
mortgage. Foolishly, we didn't check his income or credit. He made only a 
$4,500 down payment, but never paid a single mortgage payment to us. 
</P>
<P>
After we started foreclosure, the day before the foreclosure sale he filed 
bankruptcy. That stopped the sale. Then he used every trick in the book. 
Finally, we hired a lawyer who got the bankruptcy "automatic stay" removed, so 
we could foreclose. Nobody bid at the sale, so we got the house back. It was a 
wreck. 
</P>
<P>
The police tell us it was used for selling drugs. I suggest you advise readers 
who carry back a mortgage for their buyers to check out the buyer's income and 
credit. Had we done so we would have learned of our buyer's very bad credit. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thank you for that excellent advice. There are many advantages of seller 
financing, but only if the home buyer has adequate income and a good credit 
history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Assessments and Real Property Value 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am considering buying a large run-down home. The seller is asking 
$175,000, but the house is only assessed for $92,500. Is there any rule of 
thumb as to how property tax assessments relate to a property's true market 
value? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. In most communities the property tax assessment has no relationship to a 
property's fair market value. A possible exception occurs where the property is 
reassessed shortly after it is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Valuing an old house in bad condition can be very difficult. You may want to 
hire a professional appraiser recommended by your bank or other local lender. 
Or you can talk with several local real estate agents familiar with the 
neighborhood to get their opinions of the home's market value. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protect Against Your Builder's Bankruptcy 
</P>
<P>
Q: Almost a year ago we bought a new home from a small builder who recently 
declared Chapter 7 "straight" bankruptcy. We should have known there was 
trouble when he failed to take care of problems, such as a cracked garage floor 
slab, doors that don't close properly, plumbing trouble and circuit breakers 
that frequently go off even without an overload. Is there some type of 
builder's trust fund to help pay for repairs to our home? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you obtained a 10-year warranty policy from a third-party new home 
warranty company, such as Home Owner's Warranty Corp. (HOW), then the warranty 
company is responsible for your home repairs when the builder goes broke. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you did not insist on such warranty protection, your only recourse 
is to get in line with all the builder's other creditors and file a claim with 
the Bankruptcy Court. It is shocking how often home builders file bankruptcy to 
get out of taking care of their obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the major builders even form a separate corporation for each new 
subdivision, and when that project is finished they either fold the corporation 
or put it into bankruptcy. Either way, the builder can escape liability for 
continuing obligations, such as repairing defects in new homes. For further 
details, please consult your attorney.

CONDO Q&amp;A: ADDED CHARGE FOR RENTAL OWNERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, Hickenbottom is past president of the Greater Los Angeles 
chapter of the Community Associations Institute (CAI). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: In the last year, three of the eight units in our condominium 
association have been rented out by the non-resident owners. All of the 
association's bookkeeping and maintenance responsibilities, except for 
gardening and trash collection, are performed by the five resident owners with 
no assistance from the non-resident owners. 
</P>
<P>
Our association's CC&amp;Rs seem to indicate that all unit owners must pay 
equal assessments. I would like to know if it is possible to amend the 
CC&amp;Rs so that owners who rent their units could be assessed a higher annual 
assessment than the resident owners without increasing their interest in the 
common area. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You might be able to get approval from enough owners to pass the 
amendment; however, it could be challenged in court. In most community 
association's legal documents, the percentage of ownership correlates with the 
assessment paid and the voting percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Your board should contact an attorney who specializes in community association 
law before proceeding with your idea. 
</P>
<P>
One solution would be to pass an amendment allowing compensation for the owners 
who serve on the board, though this brings in several other concerns, such as 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The board members should not have the power to approve the amount of their own 
compensation. Being paid for their work may increase their personal liability 
and may have an impact on their liability insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
A better solution would be to increase the association budget to include 
contracting with companies or individuals for all of the association's 
responsibilities, including bookkeeping and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Then the true cost of taking care of the complex and running the association 
would be shared by all owners. Board members would still have to serve on the 
board to determine policy matters, but this would surely decrease the number of 
hours spent and reduce the resentment between resident and non-resident owners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clarifying the Law on Late Charges 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own a condominium unit that is rented out. The association's monthly 
newsletter recently stated that the California Civil Code permits a late charge 
of 10% plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to know exactly what the law says. 
</P>
<P>
Can the association assess a late charge of $14 to save computation time rather 
than computing the 10% late charge? 
</P>
<P>
A: Here is the wording of Civil Code Section 1366(c): "Regular and special 
assessments levied pursuant to the governing documents are delinquent 15 days 
after they become due. If an assessment is delinquent, the association may 
recover all of the following: 
</P>
<P>
(1) Reasonable costs incurred in collecting the delinquent assessment, 
including reasonable attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
(2) A late charge not exceeding ten percent of the delinquent assessment or ten 
dollars ($10), whichever is greater, unless the declaration (CC&amp;Rs) 
specifies a late charge in a smaller amount, in which case any late charge 
imposed shall not exceed the amount specified in the declaration. 
</P>
<P>
(3) Interest on all sums imposed in accordance with this section, including the 
delinquent assessment, reasonable costs of collection, and later charges, at an 
annual percentage rate not to exceed 12 percent interest, commencing 30 days 
after the assessment becomes due." 
</P>
<P>
Section 1366(d) states that "Associations are hereby exempted from 
interest-rate limitations imposed by Article XV of the California Constitution, 
subject to the limitations of this section." 
</P>
<P>
It appears that your association's late charge of $14 is a combination of the 
flat $10 fee plus a $4 collection fee. The association may levy the late charge 
in this manner without computing the percentage unless the declaration 
specifically states otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Refer to your association's declaration to see if the specified late charge is 
a smaller amount. Civil Code Section 1366(c) (2) is one example of a statute 
that does not supersede the association's legal documents. 
</P>
<P>
The association's delinquency procedures should be distributed to the members 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Sleep Because of Dogs Upstairs 
</P>
<P>
Q: I purchased my condominium unit about a year ago in a renovated conversion. 
A few months after I moved in, the unit above me was sold. The new owners 
installed hardwood floors in every room and brought two full-grown sheep dogs 
with them when they moved in. 
</P>
<P>
My unit is small and I cannot escape the sound of dog nails and footsteps above 
my head. I work very late hours and am awakened every morning by this noise. 
</P>
<P>
When I bought my unit the developer only offered carpet and tile as floor 
coverings. Therefore, I did not anticipate this kind of problem. I have written 
letters, spoken at board meetings and made numerous phone calls but nothing has 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
The man upstairs is now serving on the board. He was elected by other dog 
owners and insists that my complaints are vindictive. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't there some way that I can get some peace and quiet? 
</P>
<P>
A: Contact an attorney for advice. I can imagine that this situation is 
certainly interfering with your enjoyment of your home. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the association's CC&amp;Rs prohibit hardwood floors, there is really 
nothing that the association board can do for you. Hardwood floors are 
prohibited in many condominiums. It's a sensible restriction, since most 
buildings do not have adequate soundproofing to make it tolerable to the 
downstairs neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you can persuade your neighbor to meet with a mediator to see what 
solution might be acceptable to both of you. It seems sensible that they would 
at least be willing to carpet the bedroom areas. 
</P>

AROUND THE HOUSE: POINSETTIAS OUTLAST THE HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK, Dardick is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poinsettias have become symbols of the holiday season and popular household 
decorations because of their bright colors. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many people regard them as temporary holiday decor and discard 
them along with the Christmas tree once the new year arrives. 
</P>
<P>
But the many new varieties of poinsettias (Euphorbia pulcherrima) now available 
have been hybridized to produce long-lasting color. With proper care and good 
attention, poinsettias can remain in bloom until spring. And the plant can 
endure for many years. 
</P>
<P>
The secret to success with poinsettias is to provide just the right amount of 
water and light. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people either drown them with water or don't water them enough," said 
Jack Williams, a grower at Paul Ecke Ranch in Encinitas, the nation's largest 
poinsettia grower. 
</P>
<P>
"Poinsettias are not particularly difficult to maintain, and can last for 
years, with careful attention," he added." 
</P>
<P>
Poinsettias respond quickly to adverse conditions by developing yellow leaves 
and then dropping them. But leaf drop doesn't mean that the plant is dead or 
dying. Before assuming that the problem is lack of water, test the soil by 
inserting a finger one inch deep. Water the plant only if the soil is dry one 
inch below the soil line. 
</P>
<P>
During the holiday season, most poinsettia plants are packaged in colorful foil 
wrappings. When watering the plant, it's crucial to remove it from the foil or 
decorative container so the water can drain through completely. 
</P>
<P>
This plant hates to have its feet wet, and is highly susceptible to root rot. 
Avoid this by making sure the plant doesn't stand in water when it's replaced 
in its container. Poking holes in the foil wrapping and watering the plant in 
its covering won't solve the problem since most people put a saucer or similar 
device under the plant to catch the dripping water. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for yellow leaves is when the plant receives insufficient light. 
The ideal location is where they can receive at least six hours of bright, 
indirect light daily. Avoid direct light, however. Keep poinsettias away from 
drafts, radiators and hot-air registers. 
</P>
<P>
Poinsettias require regularly feeding to thrive. Because the growers have 
supplied them with a regular fertilizing program while they were developing in 
greenhouses prior to sale, the plants will have enough fertilizer in their soil 
to last them through the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Poinsettias can remain as indoor houseplants or be transported outdoors when 
all danger of frost is past, usually in March or April, depending on the garden 
location. 
</P>
<P>
If the poinsettia is to be planted in a garden, choose a site that provides 
bright light, but that's protected from hot, direct sunlight. The plant's color 
is from the bracts, rather than its flowers (poinsettias, like other euphorbias 
produce very small, nondescript flowers). But poinsettias require long periods 
of darkness for the bracts to develop their characteristic color. 
</P>
<P>
September through December, poinsettias require more hours of dark than of 
light. Nature provides this with long, dark nights, but the natural balance of 
light and dark can be interrupted if the plant is in a spot where inside lights 
or outdoor spotlights or street lights shine on it. If this happens, it will be 
necessary to cover the plant each night until the bract coloration forms. 
</P>
<P>
Poinsettias require good, loose well-draining soil that's neutral or slightly 
acid. 
</P>
<P>
After selecting the garden site and preparing the soil, cut the potted plant 
back to about six inches above the soil line. This should result in several 
leaves left on each branch, and will help the plant stay short and bushy. When 
planting, be sure to place the plant at the same soil level it was in the pot. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that because of the changes hybridizers have made in poinsettias, 
the newer varieties do better kept in pots outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
When new growth appears, the plant should be transplanted to a larger 
container. Pot up one size larger. Use any good-quality commercial potting soil 
mix and water well. Check the plant for water requirements in a similar manner 
as if it were indoors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to root rot, poinsettias are susceptible to white fly infestation. 
If this happens, spray the plant thoroughly with an insecticidal soap 
preparation, available at local nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
While the standard three- to six-bloom, red poinsettia is the most frequently 
used decoration, other sizes, shapes and colors are also available. 
</P>
<P>
Colors can range from creamy white through shades of pink and orange. Some have 
marbled bracts of pink and white or pink flecks on red. Sizes range from 
miniature to trees and hanging baskets. 
</P>
<P>
For many people, enjoyment of poinsettias has been marred by the plant's 
notorious reputation as being deadly to children and pets. But the plant has 
been given a clean bill of health as a result of research conducted at Ohio 
State University.

ONE MAN'S FAMILY'S 20 YEAR LOVE AFFAIR WITH MAZATLAN; 
</P>
<P>
SAME TIME, NEXT YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL MUNZELL, Munzell is a San Francisco free-lance writer currently 
working on a screenplay.

<P>
MAZATLAN, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We went back to the Bungalows Sandra last year -- Mom, Dad and I -- back to 
where it all began. The cab driver shrugged and said, "No existan" when I gave 
our destination. I had to direct the way, along the coast road with its endless 
tawny beaches and battalions of palms picketing the median strip. As each tree 
whispered by, another memory flashed momentarily to life. 
</P>
<P>
We rattled past the once-infamous Copa de Leche cafe, up the steep switchback 
where the Collegio Pacifico hangs out almost into the surf and into the 
saddleback of the hilltop where, to the southeast, all of Mazatlan sweeps out 
below. 
</P>
<P>
The bungalows were still there, hard by the crumpled concrete of the street. 
And "ours" was still inhabited. But its once-dazzling, canary-yellow walls were 
gray and scabrous. From broken window panes came exhalations of soured 
foodstuffs and hopes. In ironic contrast, an orange bougainvillea that was but 
a stick in 1969 had erupted into a glowing lava flow of flowers over the front 
of the building -- nature adorning that which it consumes. 
</P>
<P>
We got out of the cab and walked half a block up the precipitous road, sniffing 
the air, marking the years. When it all began, I was just back from Vietnam and 
it was to this enchanted hilltop retreat that I brought my bride to escape the 
blood dreams and the hatreds that poisoned the United States. For a year we 
basked in mellow Mexican sunshine and some of my youth was miraculously 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
That Christmas, my parents, Obie and Tony, came all the way from Missouri by 
land to visit. It was their first real trip outside the United States. Obie has 
an ear condition that prevents her from flying, so traveling long distances is 
arduous. But they came -- partly in parental concern and partly because of the 
lip-smacking letters we had written about the beauty of the town, the beaches, 
the people. With a single sampling, they were hooked. 
</P>
<P>
Every year since -- 21 in all -- they have returned to Mazatlan for a few weeks 
at Christmastime. And every year save one, I have flown from my California 
redoubt to be with them. This weekend I pack my bags yet again. 
</P>
<P>
After bunking with us in the bungalow the first year, the family subsequently 
moved to a hotel. The best in those early days was the Playa Mazatlan at the 
northern terminus of the paved coast road, a few miles from city center. 
</P>
<P>
There were a couple of other decent hostelries in town, but for ambience, 
comfort and elan, the Playa had no rivals. All the local swells, their lilting 
senoritas (and their duenas) swarmed onto the expansive ocean-side terrace to 
sip exotic rums and dance the darkly sensuous steps of Latin courtship. 
</P>
<P>
Vacationing in Mazatlan could be a challenge. Water supplies were iffy and 
tended to peter out as the day wore on. But all that has changed now. This 
year, the Playa even added special taps in the bathrooms delivering purified 
water for drinking. In a perverse way, we miss the old days: Spotting the folks 
-- caught in mid-shower when the water died -- as they sneaked into the dining 
room with shampoo still bubbling in their hair. 
</P>
<P>
The years have brought vast changes to the Playa Mazatlan, but the important 
character of the place has remained the same: tiled floors and balcony 
corridors, a casual elegance that permits bikini and tuxedo to meet on equal 
standing in the public rooms. There are much grander hotels now -- the imposing 
Camino Real; the stark, high-concept El Cid, and dozens of others purveying 
myriad notions of what a resort hotel should be. But for my money, the Playa is 
still the only place to be. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Munzell family, like many others that migrate annually, has been 
assimilated by the hotel family. The hotel staff has had remarkably few 
changes. Obie knows all the names, the spouses and the children. And she knows 
as much of the dramas of their lives as she can piece together with her limited 
Spanish, their limited English and her uninhibited -- and wholly inventive -- 
sign language. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, too, weighs in with his share of local lore, though he is more restrained 
when it comes to nosing into other people's lives. But since he is the 
fisherman in the family, he hobnobs at dawn, waist-deep in the surf with locals 
and tourists alike. In the brotherhood of fishermen, rank is determined not by 
nationality, salary or color of skin but by the size of the catch. It's a great 
lesson in egalitarianism. And rankings change daily. 
</P>
<P>
Until recent times, Tony would sail for the horizon aboard one of the many 
sport-fishing boats several times each vacation. And I, the ever-dutiful son, 
would accompany him on one outing per annum. In the years before the 
divorce,while my bride was still in the picture, she was an ever-eager 
accomplice. But I set a strict limit. My excursions are remembered through a 
poison-green haze. Most of the time I doubled over the rail and prayed not for 
marlin but for deliverance. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping, Obie's passion, does for Tony what deep-sea fishing does for me, but 
he is ever the courtly accomplice on her sprees. Obie could shop todo Mazatlan 
in six hours as late as 1973. Tiendas catering to the tourist trade were 
limited then, but there was always the wonderful downtown central market with 
its dazzling displays of vegetables, brightly colored clothes, trays of squid 
and prawns, and nameless pastel fishes. And . . . carnicerias. 
</P>
<P>
The first time Obie wandered into the meat quadrant of the market has become a 
chapter of family lore. Half carcasses of cows with stripped ribs lounged 
across worn counters. Pigs' heads gazed hither and yon as though vaguely 
looking for their missing bodies. Entrails were heaped here or slopped in 
buckets there. Everywhere was the smell of blood and the sound of a thousand 
flies who had found nirvana. Obie took one gander, lost a week's worth of sun 
coloring and backed out the entryway. Now she can't wait for the first downtown 
shopping day to see if it's still the same as she remembers. (It is.) 
</P>
<P>
Then and now, much of the shopping in Mazatlan can be done from the comfort of 
one's palapa on the beach. Intrepid merchants haul the booty along the Zona 
Dorada, where all the swell hotels and shops have sprung up (the coast road has 
now been paved for miles to the north of the Hotel Playa), and display it with 
dramatic flourishes just outside the rope that separates hotel-owned beach from 
federally owned beach. 
</P>
<P>
Bargaining was tortuous for Obie initially until she realized that for the 
merchants, it's the zest of the transaction. Pride is at stake, not just pesos. 
There are more shopping opportunities than ever these days, but there's not 
much buying by us. In 20 years, the Munzells have purchased at least one of 
everything ever whittled, cut, fired, woven, painted or ball-peened in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
That stunning serape in tropical fruit colors looks irresistible on the beach, 
but where to hang it in a stateside formal dining room of ivory and powder blue 
presents a major interior-design dilemma. Countless crafts have moved from 
Mazatlan through customs, into our homes, up to the attics and into sidewalk 
sales virtually without pausing. 
</P>
<P>
Vacations can be divided into two categories: those for sightseeing and those 
for sloth. Mazatlan, for us, caters to the latter. There is much to be said for 
lying on a beach and having people bring you things. And so it is, day after 
dreamy day. Our routine is to arise in the morning at no appointed hour. Tony 
is usually out before sunup to fish and to put marker towels and paraphernalia 
on chairs and table in order to "reserve" our palapa in the first-come, 
first-served world of beach etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
Obie and I wander down between 8 and 9 a.m. Rogelio and Jesus, two of the 
meseros de la playa (beach waiters), keep an eye peeled for us and deliver 
coffee while we contemplate a breakfast order. 
</P>
<P>
After some fruit or a few strips of bacon (the best this side of Irish 
rashers), we rest to prepare for our arduous day. Mid-morning, if it doesn't 
disturb our reading, we may swim or take a short walk down the beach toward the 
cathedral-like laser disco, Valentino's, which soars skyward from a 
bold-shouldered rock in the surf at the southern end of the Zona Dorada. 
</P>
<P>
Then, of course, there's lunch -- a cunning little pepino (steak sandwich) or a 
plate of cold prawns. I usually order French fries, another taste-bud 
tantalizer from the hotel kitchens. I think they may cook them in an olive-oil 
mix. I'm not sure about the technique, but the result is sublime. And I can 
point with pride to the fries for at least six weeks after returning home every 
year. They make a nice little ring of flab to hide unsightly belts on dress 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming in the afternoon is almost imperative. Obie likes to stroke out beyond 
the waves to float and paddle around. I like to merge with the breakers and 
ride them crashing onto the shore. This always deposits buckets of sand in my 
suit and gives my physique a somewhat "heavy diaper" silhouette, but it's a 
small price to pay for such thundering, foaming excitement. 
</P>
<P>
A subsequent miles-long forced march down the beach is optional. Tony 
invariably finds a compelling reason to absent himself. But this is Obie's 
constitutional, her concession to physicians' yammerings and the pervasive Jane 
Fonda consciousness. I enjoy the hike. 
</P>
<P>
It is during this time that hometown gossip is relayed and family matters 
shaken out for airing. It's been 25 years since I left Jefferson City, Mo., to 
follow a career on the coasts of the United States, but Obie manages to 
perpetually overlook that little detail. "You remember that darling girl over 
on Meadow Lane that you used to date?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh you know. That darling girl -- what's her name? Well, she married one of 
the Weber boys -- he's an insurance agent now, nice boy (over 40, still a boy . 
. . ) and they have two adorable little girls. Well . . . " What then ensues 
will be a link in the daisy-chain of small-town life, the retelling of an 
anecdote or event that knits people into a community and leaves a marker notch 
in time's passing. These stories give a texture and flavor to life that is 
often absent from the big coastal city where I live. It's something I miss and 
I relish its taste during those long walks along Mazatlan's sun-splashed 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
After returning to the palapa, we get serious about rest. Too much activity can 
be hazardous to your holiday. Mid- to late-afternoon is reserved for reading, 
reflecting and gazing through lazy-lidded eyes at the passing parade on the 
beach, the boat-pulled parachutes, the jet skis and wave runners and boogie 
board riders. 
</P>
<P>
Folks in neighboring palapas visit, compare prices on purchased treasures, 
exchange restaurant tips or slip into slumber abetted by the yellow heat, blue 
water and white noise of the waves. Later we retire to the room to bathe, dress 
for dinner and lounge on the balcony as the sun screams away the day with neon 
colors -- surely the inspiration for all those vivid, acrylic-on-black-velvet 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Evenings are a wild card. Often we'll just meander down to the hotel dining 
room, which is open to the night sky and lapped by surf at high tide. Other 
nights we'll venture forth in search of a new culinary experience. Senor 
Frog's, the local fun-intensive link in the famous Carlos and Charlie's chain, 
is a must at least once every year. Obie loves the theatricality of it all. A 
waiter might snatch your hat and wear it all evening. Another, passing behind a 
lady's chair, might dangle a rubber spider down her decolletage. A 
central-casting bandido will have double-shot glasses in his bandoleras, and 
his holsters will house a bottle of tequila and another of Sprite. These are 
mixed half-and-half and slammed down on the table to detonate all the 
carbonation and make the concoction look like milk in a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
Diners are supposed to down the drinks in a single gulp. One is liberating. Two 
are electrifying. Three are lethal. Tony loves Senor Frog's baby-back barbecued 
ribs, which, admittedly, are unparalleled in the hemisphere. One note of 
caution: When dressing for this place, accessorize with earplugs. 
</P>
<P>
There are Mexican fiestas at the Playa hotel on weekends and holidays. The 
Munzell family has attended these exuberant if somewhat amateurish celebrations 
with devotion bordering on obsession, thanks primarily to Obie's insistence. 
The shows never change. We have watched sylphlike teen dancers thicken and slow 
into shuffling matrons over the years. We have seen the magician's act so often 
that all of us could perform it without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Obie finally asked Manuel, the chap in charge of the show, why he 
never adds new routines. After some stammering and stuttering, he confessed 
that we were the only ones ever to buy tickets more than once, and that so far 
as the rest of the world is concerned, the show is perpetually new-minted. Obie 
threw back her head and howled. And promptly made reservations for the next 
show. 
</P>
<P>
The penultimate day of this year's vacation, Obie left the beach early to have 
her hair done. That evening, friends from Denver -- Ken and Verna Allen -- 
joined us fordinner on the terrace. Obie was regaling them with the comic 
differences between a Midwestern beauty emporium (swift, efficient, 
businesslike) and her favorite Mazatlan salon, where the operators pursue 
endless love on the phone, leave customers under dryers until they crisp and 
generally devote themselves to matters of the heart instead of matters at hand. 
</P>
<P>
When the waiter inquired if we cared to order cocktails, Obie, a virtual 
teetotaler, gushed, "Oh, let's do. Let's all get a drink." We did. As the 
beverages arrived, she lifted her glass and said, "Let's drink to . . . " 
Inspiration failed her. We all waited with glasses aloft. "Let's celebrate . . 
. " Suddenly she beamed, " . . . my hair!" 
</P>
<P>
In the perfect circle of family, friends and vacation fun, no more appropriate 
toast was possible. It was a full minute before the bubbles of laughter in our 
throats permitted us to drink. 
</P>
<P>
On the evening of their departure, I rode to the train station to see the folks 
off to Nogales, the first leg of their six-day overland journey home. I trotted 
beside the departing train and waved them off into the night, then took a cab 
back to the center of the city. El Centro used to be just that. Now it's called 
"Old Mazatlan" on tourist maps. 
</P>
<P>
Not much has changed there. Municipal improvements are slow in coming. 
Sidewalks are narrow and buckled. Streets aren't much better and mud seems to 
seep up through cracks in the pavement when no one is looking. Some of the 
storefronts haven't tasted paint since cars had fins. 
</P>
<P>
But I love this part of the city. I particularly love to walk through it at 
night when the hubbub is reduced to a few hot spots around food stands or shops 
that stay open late. It's after the tourists have streamed back to the Zona 
Dorada that the real flavors of Mexico come through. 
</P>
<P>
As I strolled down the streets, moist and slightly steamy after a short shower, 
I could smell the smoke of carne asada broiling over an open fire in an 
enclosed courtyard, and I could hear laughter echoing down rainslicked alleys. 
But everywhere I turned, I felt the lingering presence of Obie and Tony. The 
surroundings said Mexico but my heart said Mom and Dad. My mind's eye added 
their forms to every backdrop I saw because at one time or another over the 
decades, they have been there in the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
When the next burst of laughter bounced off the building beside me, I added a 
great dollop of my own to it and sent it rolling toward the central market. I 
was cackling like an idiot but I couldn't help it. 
</P>
<P>
To the empty streets, I shrieked: "And then she said, 'Let's celebrate my 
hair!' "

CHOOSING THE RIGHT SHIP CAN BE KEY TO CRUISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. YENCKEL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A colleague mentioned the other day that he and his wife had been thinking 
about taking their first cruise. But, he confessed, "We don't know the first 
thing about how to choose the right one for us." 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising the couple is confused. As many as 150 cruise ships sail 
the world's seas, and no two are exactly alike. You can pick a compatible ship 
and have a great vacation, or sail on a bummer and rue the day you wasted so 
much money. 
</P>
<P>
Price, of course, is a major factor, but it should not be the only basis for 
reaching a decision. The ship's style, itinerary and size are also important 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Carnival Cruise Lines calls its growing fleet "the fun ships," and its 
brochures depict a youngish, bikini-clad crowd in frenzied activity. 
</P>
<P>
Society Expeditions' clientele appears older; photos in its brochures might 
show them with binoculars and boots studying penguins in the Antarctic. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on your personal tastes, you can select from among ships that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Promise a lively, nonstop party, or fill your evenings with scholarly 
lectures. Dock at a new port every day, or rarely go near a port. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seek out sun-drenched beaches, or explore ancient cities and other 
historical sites. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feature budget-conscious three- and four-day getaways, or cruise leisurely 
on itineraries that stretch on for weeks and months. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cater to families (premier Cruise Lines identifies itself as "the official 
cruise line of Walt Disney World") or make themselves available to 
special-interest outings such as cruises for singles. 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer intimacy, it can be found on small ships such as those operated 
by the American Canadian Caribbean Line, which carry as few as 76 passengers. 
But as might be expected, on-board recreational facilities are, by necessity, 
very limited. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's new Sovereign of the Seas, the 
largest liner afloat, is a full-fledged resort in everything but name -- 
offering practically everything except 18 holes of golf. It can carry more than 
2,200 passengers. When the Sovereign docks at a Caribbean port such as St. 
Thomas in the Virgin Islands, passengers spill into the streets like an 
invading army. 
</P>
<P>
On my first cruise a few years back, aboard Norwegian Cruise Line's Sunward II, 
a magnificent sunset rewarded our last night at sea. The sky was so 
spectacular, the captain made an announcement over the public-address system 
urging everyone to go on deck and take a look. Hardly anybody showed up, 
however, and my wife and I continued to watch in pleasant solitude. Later we 
discovered why: Our fellow passengers were engrossed in bingo. If there were 
ever a next time, I told myself, I would find a ship catering to folks who 
prefer scenery over games. 
</P>
<P>
"There are different breeds of travelers," says Ron Bitting, president of the 
National Assn. of Cruise Only Agencies. "You've got the backpackers," by which 
he means adventurous travelers, "and you've got the traveler who needs to plan 
a year ahead and wants to know what side of the bed the phone is on." 
</P>
<P>
Bitting's organization represents about 800 travel agencies nationwide, 
including those that handle nothing but cruise vacations as well as 
full-service agencies with separate cruise divisions. The goal of the 
specialists is to match passengers with a cruise they will enjoy -- which, 
despite the romantic ballyhoo of cruise-line advertising, is no easy matter. 
</P>
<P>
A travel agent himself for almost three decades, Bitting heads Personal Touch 
Cruise Consultants of Freeport, N.Y. He has put together a detailed 
questionnaire, which his staff uses to determine the interests of his 
customers. Among the very specific questions: Do you prefer a new ship sleekly 
modern in decor or an older one that reflects an earlier era? If you like an 
older ship, he suggests sailing the 30-year-old Rotterdam of Holland America 
Line ("It's so beautifully maintained"). 
</P>
<P>
One tip to getting a ship you will like, says Bitting, is to find one that 
offers activities similar to those you enjoy on land-based vacations. If you 
tell Bitting that you want to sample several beaches, he probably will book you 
on a ship plying the Caribbean. If gambling, disco dancing and a vibrant night 
life are most important to you, he will find you a party ship. In the first 
example, itinerary is of primary importance, he notes; to the night owl, the 
ship's activities come first, regardless of its destination. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major considerations when choosing a cruise vacation: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Price: "In all instances, price is important," says Bitting. "Everybody is 
price-conscious. We have people booking $20,000 cruises, but they want it for 
$19,500." 
</P>
<P>
Last-minute bargains often are available because many new ships have been built 
recently and the availability of cabins has outstripped demand -- at least 
temporarily. But Bitting cautions that the bargains are not for everyone. You 
don't, for example, get first choice on cabins, and often have to take the 
leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
An easygoing traveler -- the backpacker, says Bitting -- may have no difficulty 
adjusting to whatever ship is offering the best price. But those people who 
demand certainty "are fooling themselves if they think they can take advantage 
of these offers." Their choices are limited, and they will not like it. "It's 
an emotional thing." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the more you pay for a cruise the classier the ship you get. Service 
should be more attentive, and your cabin should be larger and better located. 
At the top of the scale, you can book a two-room suite with a private veranda 
open to the sea. For this, you might pay as much as $2,000 a night for two 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The cheapest cabins may have no window or porthole and be located in the ship's 
equivalent of the basement. For real savings, four adults can share a bunk-bed 
cabin at a rate of perhaps $125 to $150 a day per person. Some travel 
counselors suggest these tight, remote quarters shouldn't matter because you 
spend very little time in your cabin. If you are claustrophobic, however, you 
probably will be happier with an outside cabin, and the closer to open air the 
better. 
</P>
<P>
The major cruise lines -- that is, those with fleets of large ships offering a 
variety of activities -- can be loosely grouped in price categories. Bitting 
lists the following among the lower-priced, mass-market lines: Chandris Fantasy 
Cruises, Celebrity Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line, Carnival Cruise Lines and 
Royal Caribbean Cruise Line. In the mid-price range, he puts Holland America 
Line, Princess Cruises and Royal Cruise Line. Upper-scale cruise lines are 
Royal Viking Line, Cunard Line and Crystal Cruises. 
</P>
<P>
Among the specialty cruise lines with upscale cabin rates are those that 
provide a luxury, yachtlike experience. These include Seabourn Cruise Line; 
Renaissance Cruises, which has introduced the all-suite concept to the sea; the 
Club Med 1, a five-masted motorized sailing vessel cruising less-visited 
islands in the Mediterranean and Caribbean, and Windstar Sail Cruises. 
</P>
<P>
Also upscale but in a category of their own, says Bitting, are the expedition 
or adventure cruise lines, whose shipboard and off-ship activities are strongly 
educational. These lines include Society Expeditions, Salen Lindblad Cruising 
and Special Expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, longer cruises are more expensive. But many travelers don't have the 
money or the time for lengthy vacations at sea. In line with an industry trend 
toward shorter cruises, Society Expeditions next year is introducing its 
version of the short cruise: a series of itineraries designed to fit within a 
two-week time frame, including travel time. Most of the line's itineraries are 
15 to 29 days. The cost of the line's shorter cruises is expected to be less 
than $300 a day per person, based on double occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Destination: Cruise fans will tell you a cruise is the best way to tour 
foreign lands, because you always have a comfortable cabin waiting at the end 
of the day and you have to unpack only once. This, of course, should be taken 
with a grain of salt. A day in port is hardly time enough for anyone to get to 
know a city or country. At the very least, a port call is an introduction to a 
destination that may lure you back on your own at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise itineraries tend to fall into three major categories: recreational, 
cultural and educational. 
</P>
<P>
The primary recreational destination for Americans is the Caribbean, both for 
its sunny beaches and shopping ports such as San Juan and St. Thomas. If your 
goal is fun in the sun, opt for a Caribbean cruise. When in port you can, of 
course, skip the beaches and the boutiques for a quick personal or escorted 
tour of island villages, historical sites and scenic attractions. 
</P>
<P>
For a deeper cultural experience, the most popular itineraries are the ancient 
ports of the Mediterranean Sea as well as Scandinavia, the west coast of 
Mexico, the islands of Hawaii, the South Pacific and South America. Such 
cruises schedule frequent sightseeing excursions, providing you with a glimpse 
of local life. 
</P>
<P>
Into the solidly educational category fall cruises that highlight wildlife 
viewing or the study of remote and exotic lands. Invariably, one or more guest 
lecturers are on board to offer evening briefings -- perhaps the night's 
entertainment -- and to accompany off-ship excursions. These destinations 
include the Inside Passage to Alaska, which has wildlife, historic and scenic 
appeal; the Arctic and Antarctica; the Amazon River, and the islands of 
Indonesia and the Indian Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Style: On my first cruise, the ship's communications system broadcast light 
rock music from morning until night. I am not a fan of this kind of music, but 
there was almost no escaping it. The sound filtered into our room from the 
hallway speakers just outside the door. The experience taught me a lesson. If 
you choose to cruise, do so on a vessel that is not going to assault your 
sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
For many travelers, style can be at least as important as price. Style can mean 
such simple differences between ships as whether dinner seating is in one or 
two shifts. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, seating aboard ships with two shifts is at 6:15 and 8:15 p.m. If you 
are dining early, you can expect to be hurried along by a staff that has to 
clean up and set the tables again for the late seating. On a single-seating 
ship, more time usually is available for a leisurely meal. Royal Viking Line 
makes a big point of advertising single seating on its ship, the Royal Viking 
Star. Or style can reflect more fundamental differences in a cruise experience. 
</P>
<P>
As Bitting points out, the large, mass-market ships -- such as those in 
Carnival's "fun" fleet, which sails year-round on a variety of Caribbean 
itineraries -- offer Las Vegas-style shows, discos, boutiques, health spas and 
gambling casinos. They appeal to gregarious, often younger travelers on a 
limited budget who are looking for a good time. If you favor the bustling 
activity of a big resort hotel, you probably will get along fine on a large 
cruise ship. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what cruise style you choose, it's important to keep in mind that the 
cost of all activities is included in the price you pay. A basic seven-day 
Carnival cruise, including air fare, ranges from about $1,000 to $2,100 per 
person, depending on cabin choice. And although even this price may seem hefty, 
it includes almost everything: food, lodging, recreation, entertainment and, in 
many cases, round-trip air fare. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you don't expect to take advantage of the activities -- if, for 
example, you have little interest in lavish entertainment or casinos -- you may 
want to consider a different style of cruise, perhaps opting for a ship where 
your money buys instead a fancier cabin or a longer cruise. On the Sunward II, 
I was never able to stay awake for the midnight buffet, nor was I much 
interested in the extra calories. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably there is fun to be had on the cruises offered by adventure lines 
such as Society Expeditions. But don't expect a lot of revelry. More sedate 
enjoyment comes in the form of scholarly pursuits, such as joining in on a 
full-day trek in southern Madagascar to view the famous ring-tailed lemurs in 
the Berenty Reserve, an option on Society Expeditions' 20-day cruise of the 
Indian Ocean, which departs Capetown, South Africa, March 26. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another entirely different style of cruising is available aboard the little 
76-passenger Shoreham II, operated by American Canadian Caribbean Line. The 
vessel's shallow draft permits it to sail right up to remote beaches where a 
ramp in the bow can be lowered to disembark passengers. Passengers can swim and 
snorkel without the crowds of a huge ship or a popular resort beach. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the New Shoreham II began cruising the Bahamas and the Caribbean, 
retracing the voyages of Christopher Columbus, who touched on some islands that 
still remain well off normal cruise paths. The captain, a student of Columbus 
lore, will provide a daily commentary. The 12-day voyages, commemorating 
Columbus's discovery of the New World five centuries ago, begin at $1,190 per 
person; air fare is additional. 
</P>
<P>
If you are considering a cruise for the first time, be aware of what you are 
looking for in a cruise experience. Sort out your priorities. Ask friends and 
relatives who have sailed for recommendations. Consider checking one of the 
standard guides to cruising available in bookstores, such as the "Berlitz 
Complete Guide to Cruising" by Douglas Ward ($13.95). The book provides a 
numerical evaluation of 125 cruise ships based on such characteristics as 
cleanliness, cuisine, passenger space, service, activities, shore excursions 
and decor. 
</P>
<P>
Consult a travel agency experienced in cruise vacations. Most cruises are sold 
through travel agents. A list of local cruise-only travel agencies can be 
obtained by sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to the National Assn. of 
Cruise Only Agencies, P.O. Box 7209, Freeport, N.Y. 11520. Specify no more than 
three states. For information: (516) 378-8006.

For 18 years, Bernice Lewis has been the Mother Superior of the singles set. 
You want to visit Las Vegas, alone or with a group? Ring up Lewis. How about 
Hawaii, the Caribbean, the Soviet Union? Buzz Lewis. Whatever the destination, 
Lewis is ready to advise the single traveler. Lewis has been counseling singles 
since shortly after being widowed in 1971. Alone for the first time in years, 
she was apprehensive about traveling solo. Others, she concluded, probably 
shared her fears. That's when Lewis became the guru among singles. Widows, 
divorced men, young singles. She counsels individuals concerning their fears, 
nurses them along as they plan their journeys. Right up to the moment of 
departure. These are one-on-one discussions. And although this isn't a dating 
game, Lewis often puts singles together for companionship as well as economy 
(avoiding the aggravating single supplement). Recently, Lewis sent a doctor off 
to Europe with other singles. The lady reported back that she had a "fabulous 
time." Lewis has been called upon to arrange honeymoons for singles who meet on 
trips. Primarily, though, her objective is to put joy into travel for singles. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand their fears," she says.

Depot Inn: B.R. of Riverside asks about "out of the ordinary" accommodations in 
Northern California. We know of a turn-of-the-century railroad station that's 
been converted into a B&amp;B near Santa Rosa. The Melitta Station Inn once 
served passengers on Southern Pacific's run between Santa Rosa and Sonoma. 
Before this it operated as a stagecoach stop. Six guest rooms (four with 
private baths). Antiques, country collectables, a wood-burning stove. A chance 
to step back to a less hurried era. Stop for the night or spend several days. 
Activities include visits to wineries, Jack London State Park, fishing, biking, 
riding.

Corsica: I've been fascinated with Corsica ever since I listened one night to a 
radiator salesman and a maid singing a duet in a smoky club in Ajaccio. It was 
like a scene in Rick's joint in the film "Casablanca." And although the 
radiator salesman and the maid were mere amateurs, they sang with soul. For 
nearly an hour the audience shouted for encores. It was the kind of spontaneous 
action for which Corsicans are famous. Corsica isn't one of those picture-post 
card islands you see on calendars. It's like no other island in any ocean. Old 
World villages. Peaks that spike clouds. Narrow, winding roads that plunge like 
a roller coaster. (Corsica is only a short boat trip off the French/Italian 
coast). 
</P>
<P>
For the young and curious, here's a chance to spend three weeks on Corsica next 
summer learning French. The package ($770) includes accommodations with a 
Corsican family, breakfast, lessons, excursions. Ages 16 and older. Starting 
dates: July 1, July 25, Aug. 5, Aug. 19, Sept. 2. A special seniors session is 
planned for September.

FOOTLOOSE: SAMPLING FLAVORS OF MAASTRICHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MAASTRICHT, Netherlands 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geography says this town is in the Netherlands, but forget the windmills and 
wooden shoes. It's really far more Burgundian-French in flavor and lifestyle, 
thanks to the frontier of French-speaking Belgium being a scant three miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Interminable Franco-Dutch wars of the 17th and 18th centuries often turned 
Maastricht into a Gallic encampment, producing a cultural fallout of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 400 cafes, brasseries and bistros in town, and Guide 
Michelin has hung more stars on Maastricht's kitchens than in any other Dutch 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Romans carving a high road from their stronghold in Cologne to the English 
Channel chose this site to ford the Maas River, hence the name (stricht 
translates roughly to ford). 
</P>
<P>
It's the Netherlands' oldest fortified city, dating to the early 13th Century, 
and also gets our vote as being the country's most colorful, having more 
monuments and protected buildings within its fortifications than any other 
Dutch city save Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
The twisting streets of Old Town on the river's west bank are little more than 
footpaths lined with 1,400 ancient buildings and tidy homes, creating a 
charming Hans Brinker woodcut of Dutch life in a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the beautiful town and its Lucullean life of fine food and drink are not 
all that Maastricht has to offer. The gentle hills of the surrounding 
countryside, reminiscent of Belgium's Ardennes Forest to the south, are 
blanketed with lovely old castles, chateaux and Tudor-style farmhouses. 
</P>
<P>
A 13th-Century French writer proclaimed: "A better place on earth than 
Maastricht cannot be found." Quite an accolade, coming from a Gallic pen. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly KLM nonstop from Los Angeles to Amsterdam; Delta, Northwest 
and other airlines with changes. Take a train direct from the airport to 
Maastricht in 2 1/2 hours for about $24. An advance-purchase, round-trip air 
ticket from LAX to Amsterdam should cost between $716 and $769. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Give the town and countryside two days, but it's also a 
great base for visiting parts of Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg, and train 
schedules are excellent. Lodging costs here are moderate, superb dining a bit 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The Dutch guilder recently sold for 1.74 to the dollar, 57 
cents each. Spring until late autumn is a good time to visit, with winter's 
pre-Lenten carnival particularly merry in Maastricht. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Maison du Chene (Boschstraat 104; $85-$95 B&amp;B double) 
has been an inn on Market Square for a century. Now owned by a former 
restaurateur, it has one of the finest hotel-kitchens in town. Bedrooms are 
bright and decorated in soothing pastels (a few with shared bath for $68), and 
the restaurant-brasserie has the cozy look of a small hotel in France. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Bergere (Stationsstraat 40; $82-$95 B&amp;B double), formerly the Stijns, 
will reopen in December. It's a block from the railway station on the main 
street of the new town, and has been given a sparkling face lift. This has been 
one of our favorites for years. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Beaumont (Wyckerbrugstraat 2; $105-$116 B&amp;B double), while not the 
top of the city's line, has been a grand dame of local hostelries for three 
generations of the same family. 
</P>
<P>
With an excellent location near the train station on one of Maastricht's pretty 
squares, Beaumont combines 18th-Century frills in some of its salons with more 
contemporary bedrooms. The Alsatian Restaurant is warm paneling and hearty 
French food. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: A menu in Maastricht opens to an inviting mixture of 
Dutch, Belgian and French food, with emphasis on the latter two. Locals share 
the Belgian-Dutch unbridled passion for fresh mussels, probably best when 
steamed simply with garlic and a bit of greenery. 
</P>
<P>
Channel sole enjoys a worldwide reputation for delicacy, but the slip tong sole 
from the North Sea is every bit its equal, particularly when grilled properly 
and boned by an expert waiter. 
</P>
<P>
While seafood (oysters, clams, fish soups) is an understandable staple, beef is 
surprisingly good in this part of the Netherlands, and game dishes are superb 
in season. Country sausage and pates appear at every turn, and the region's 
Limburger cheese goes well with Ardennes ham in a lunchtime sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
Jenever (Dutch gin) is a popular spirits lifter, and the beers of the 
Netherlands need no introduction. 
</P>
<P>
Good local dining: 't Plenkske (Boschstraat 27), named for the wooden street 
(Plankstraat) that covered soggy ground during Roman times, is an elegant 
enclave of plum-velvet banquettes and Pompeii-red walls, with lovely china and 
crystal and original wall plaques in Art Deco style done by a local artist. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is in keeping with its surroundings: lobster bisque with Armagnac, 
smoked eel, fillet of hare stuffed with nuts, roast pigeon with bacon and broad 
beans from the marshes. 
</P>
<P>
L'Escale (Havenstraat 19) is the town's port of call for lovers of fine 
seafood. If it swims, it's probably on the menu here and prepared with great 
finesse. 
</P>
<P>
L'Escale has its own brand of elegant decor and, like 't Plenkske, has a small 
terrace overlooking an enclosed square that was once the site of Roman baths. 
</P>
<P>
Petit Bonheur (Kapoenstraat 32), in a 1614 building, takes you back to a 
Maastricht of beamed ceilings, a regal courtyard and barrel-vaulted wine 
cellars below. The young owner-chef does wonders with an all-French menu, some 
of the dishes being escargot Bourguignon, venison consomme and steak sauteed 
with green peppers or port wine and garlic. 
</P>
<P>
Main dishes are in the $14 range, and Petit Bonheur more than holds its own in 
a town noted for superior kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Hotel Derlon (O. L. Vrouweplein 6; $190-$700 double, 
depending upon season and room) is a Maastricht anomaly: an ultra-modern, 
five-star hotel with beautifully preserved remains of an old Roman forum and 
temple in the basement. It is also in the oldest and most colorful part of 
town, on a charming little square. 
</P>
<P>
Derlon lacks absolutely nothing in comforts and amenities for its guests, who 
may take tea or coffee beside the Roman ruins below. 
</P>
<P>
Two visits to Hotel-Restaurant Prinses Juliana (Broekhem 11, Valkenburg; $153 
double), a 10-minute drive from Maastricht, have convinced us that the dining 
room has few peers in the Netherlands. Our medallions of venison in a heavenly 
sauce, the formidable wine book and superior service made for a most memorable 
evening, worthy of a member of the prestigious Relais &amp; Chateaux group. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Get a feeling for the town by stopping at a cafe on enormous 
Vrijthof Square, with the twin Romanesque towers of St. Servatius Basilica and 
the 300-foot Gothic steeple of St. Jans Church forming a dramatic backdrop 
across the square. 
</P>
<P>
The liveliest place before noon is nearby Market Square, where the Town Hall 
looks down like a stolid Dutch uncle on canvas awnings over the colorful stalls 
alive with shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
You may drive the gorgeous countryside on your own, perhaps having lunch at a 
three-centuries-old farmhouse such as Hotel Hoeve de Plei in Mechelen, near the 
Belgian border. 
</P>
<P>
Valkenburg is a charming little fortified town with many handsome old 
buildings, colorful gardens and battlements. But don't attempt to visit at 
midsummer, when it's wall-to-wall with tourists and souvenir shops. 
</P>
<P>

Netherlands.

MAKING THE MOST OF MAZATLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Munzell 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Getting there: Mazatlan is equidistant from Mexico City and Nogales on the U.S. 
border -- 720 miles in each direction. Highway 15 from Nogales is two-lane 
blacktop. If you want to come by car, be young, adventurous and absolutely 
indifferent to the fate of your vehicle's springs and brakes. Four first-class 
and two second-class bus lines also serve the city, but bus travel is 
recommended only for the young and resilient. Mexicana (213-646-9500), Alaska 
(800-426-0333) and Delta Airlines (213-386-5510) offer regular service from Los 
Angeles. With a seven-day advance purchase, prices range from about $240 to 
$300 round trip. 
</P>
<P>
Where to stay: The Hotel Playa Mazatlan is one of the oldest resort hotels in 
Mazatlan, but has been continually upgraded to keep apace of the amenities 
offered by newer inns. Further up the beach is El Cid, one of the largest 
high-rise complexes, somewhat less friendly in appearance and appurtenances but 
extremely popular. Los Sabalos, almost next door to Playa Mazatlan to the 
south, is a soaring maze of what were supposed to be condominiums. Pretty but 
pricey. The Holiday Inn is a blocky hunk of a high-rise with a good location 
but ordinary amenities. The Camino Real may be the poshest of the resorts, but 
it's built on a bluff over the ocean and requires a funicular to get down to a 
tiny fingernail beach. 
</P>
<P>
Getting around: City buses will take you anywhere you want to go almost for 
free. Current fare is 300 pesos, or about seven cents. Avoid morning and 
evening rush hours because the buses get stuffed to the gills. Charming little 
vehicles called pulmonias (meaning, literally, pneumonias), which are a cross 
between a go-cart, a VW bug and a surrey with the fringe on top, zip all over 
town for a few dollars. Be sure to establish the price before you board. There 
are no meters. The taxis, too, are not metered. Make sure the driver knows your 
destination and how many are in your party. Some drivers have been known to 
play the game of "the price is 10,000 pesos," and when you arrive, they add, 
"each." 
</P>
<P>
What to do: Catamarans, surfboards, jet skis, wave runners and parasailing are 
available for hire along the beaches of the Zona Dorada. Amphibious vehicles 
regularly troll the beach for passengers to Deer Island, one of three just off 
the coast where snorkelers congregate. Most major hotels have pools and some 
have tennis courts. There are two 18-hole golf courses -- one at El Cid Hotel 
on Avenida Camaron Sabalo, the other at the Club Campestre on Highway 15, 20 
minutes from town. 
</P>
<P>
Deep-sea fishing is a big -- and competitive -- business. Sales reps ply the 
beach, holding up photos of their boats and making reservations on the spot. 
But it's a good idea to meander down to the port some day and look over the 
fleet in the late afternoon after the craft have returned from a day on the 
bounding main. Some look more seaworthy than others. Horses can be rented at 
Guadalupe Ranch, minutes from the hotel zone. 
</P>
<P>
The downtown Mercado Municipal is fascinating. Many of the typical souvenirs -- 
T-shirts, shorts, sweats, knickknacks, etc. -- are cheapest here. The tonier 
shops, with exquisite arts, crafts, gifts, clothing and shoes, are concentrated 
along Camaron Sabalo and Avenida Rodolfo Loaiza, the two streets that run 
through the Zona Dorada. 
</P>
<P>
Where to eat: Senor Frog's on Avenida del Mar is far and away the most popular 
place in town with locals and tourists alike. It's loud and rowdy and 
chock-full of craziness, but offers about as much fun as a human is permitted 
to have. Plus the food is terrific. Though Mamuca's at 404 Simon Bolivar West 
is now being listed in tourist brochures, it was one of those best-kept secrets 
for decades and still offers some of the best authentic Mexican-style seafood 
in town. It's funky, off the beaten path and very no-nonsense. Casa Loma, 104 
Gaviotas Ave., just a couple of blocks off the Zona Dorada, has a pretty 
courtyard (avoid the garish red inside dining room unless it's raining) with a 
plashing fountain. Along with excellent seafood and steaks, the menu frequently 
includes such All-American entrees as lamb shank. 
</P>
<P>
For prawn lovers who can forgo the fancy stuff, go to the open-air Shrimp 
Factory on the Avenida Rodolfo Loaiza just north of the Playa Hotel on the 
corner of De La Garza. There they serve nothing but prawns scooped from the sea 
that very day. They're not cheap but they're the best in town. 
</P>
<P>
Night life: If your fun quotient isn't expended at Senor Frog's, there are a 
variety of discos that thump through the night. 
</P>
<P>
Valentino's, Avenida del Mar at R. Buelna Ave., looks like a church, so 
stunning is its soaring architecture, but it's really just a shrine to good 
times. Laser shows punctuate the driving dance beat. 
</P>
<P>
The Caracol Tango Palace in the El Cid Resort, Avenida Camaron Sabalo, is a 
multimillion-dollar disco showplace. Bring money. And earplugs. 
</P>
<P>
Frankie Oh!, at 226 Avenida del Mar, is both a disco and a video theater and 
advertises a separate "romantic disco," whatever that is. 
</P>
<P>
For real romance -- Latin rhythms and perfumed cheek-to-cheek dancing -- 
there's no place like the terrace at the Hotel Playa Mazatlan smack in the 
center of Avenida Rodolfo T. Loaiza in the heart of the Zona Dorada. 
</P>
<P>
Getting help: Mazatlan stands out in all of Mexico for its tourist service. The 
only lawyer who works solely for the benefit of tourists, Edna Aguirre, is 
stationed there at the City Tourism Bureau, 100 Avenida Rodolfo Loaiza (across 
the street from Los Sabalos Hotel, through an archway, into a courtyard and 
look to the left). Ms. Aguirre speaks flawless English and is apparently very 
persuasive in court. Michael Munzell

YOUTH BEAT: GEORGIA HOSTEL OFFERS ROOMS IN TREE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BRUNSWICK, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the bargain price of $6 a night, young travelers can stay in a tree house 
in Georgia. Then, using it as a base, they can investigate an island park with 
200 wild horses, a 600-square-mile swamp that is home to more than 10,000 
alligators, and another island that was once the private resort of America's 
wealthiest families. 
</P>
<P>
Located in a 90-acre section of forest, about 15 miles southwest of Brunswick, 
the Hostel in the Forest can accommodate about 40 people. Most stay in 
dormitory rooms in a geodesic dome, but there are also two tree houses, each 
with a large picture window and a double bed. All beds are $6 a night for Youth 
Hostel Assn. members, $7 for nonmembers. 
</P>
<P>
Those needing transportation can arrange to be picked up at the airport or bus 
station for $2 by a member of the hostel staff. To make arrangements, call 
(912) 264-9738. The hostel entrance is on U.S. 82. From Interstate 95, take 
exit No. 6 for two miles. 
</P>
<P>
Guests without their own transportation to surrounding sites can obtain 
assistance from the hostel staff. When time permits, the staff will use the 
hostel mini-van to provide transportation for the cost of gas. 
</P>
<P>
About nine miles from the hostel is a causeway that stretches six miles across 
marshland to Jekyll Island. For 55 years the island was a private resort for 
families, including the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Pulitzers and Goodyears. Now 
it has 10 hotels and a campground. Rent a bike for $10 per day at the miniature 
golf course and use the 20 miles of paved paths to investigate the historic 
district and beaches or bird-watch by the marshes. 
</P>
<P>
Jekyll Island Campground is off Beachview Drive on the north end of the island. 
It has 220 tent and trailer sites, which range from $10 to $14 per night. A 
deposit equal to one night's stay is required to hold a site. Visa and 
MasterCard are accepted. Call (912) 635-3021. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 miles from the tree house hostel, on the border between Georgia and 
Florida, is the fishing village of St. Mary's. This is where to catch a ferry 
($7.95 round trip) to cross several miles of marsh to reach Cumberland Island, 
the largest and most southern of Georgia's barrier islands. 
</P>
<P>
This 16-mile-long island has a white-sand beach, sand dunes up to 40 feet high, 
a nesting ground for loggerhead turtles and is home to about 200 wild horses 
that are descendants of polo ponies, plough horses and wild mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
Park staff offer some interpretive walks that include ruins of a Carnegie 
mansion and a museum in the Carnegie estate's original ice house. Free camping, 
for up to seven days, is possible in developed and back-country sites. There 
are no shops on the island, only water and washrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you plan to go for the day or camp, you need reservations. Call 
weekdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.: (912) 822-4335. 
</P>
<P>
The Okefenokee Swamp is about 55 miles from the tree house hostel. Now a 
National Wildlife Refuge, the swamp is home to 225 species of birds and 58 
species of reptiles. From the hostel, enter at Folkston, where there is a 
4,000-foot scenic boardwalk and a 50-foot observation tower. A guided boat tour 
is $5 an hour. Canoe rentals are $10.77 per day, motorboats $27.80.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: CLUB HAS REDUCED RATES FOR B&amp;BS

<TEXT>
<P>
Mature travelers who enjoy an old-fashioned bed and breakfast at old-fashioned 
rates of $18 per night single or $24 double might want to check out a 
relatively new group, TravelClub Bed and Breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
TravelClub is a kid sister of the older Evergreen Club, which was started nine 
years ago by Pat Wilson in Maryland for singles or couples over age 50. 
</P>
<P>
Evergreen Club requires all bed and breakfast owners/members to have guest 
rooms available to other club members for $10 a night single or $15 double. In 
other words, members must host as well as be hosted.

Evergreen is still going strong and has moved its headquarters to Redondo 
Beach. Today, it has more than 500 members, mostly in the United States and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Evergreen Club found many mature travelers who wanted to join 
and stay in private bed and breakfast rooms but could not themselves host other 
members. 
</P>
<P>
So TravelClub Bed and Breakfast was born. Like Evergreen, it's for mature 
travelers age 50 and older. But TravelClub does not require that members host 
other member guests. 
</P>
<P>
At $18 a night single, $24 double, including breakfast, TravelClub's overnight 
rates are higher than Evergreen's but still moderate compared with many other 
bed and breakfast inns. 
</P>
<P>
And TravelClub currently has bed and breakfast accommodations in about 180 
homes, according to Linda Mardi, daughter of Evergreen founder Pat Wilson. Most 
are in the Sun Belt. 
</P>
<P>
Annual TravelClub dues are $40 for singles, $50 per couple. That includes a bed 
and breakfast host directory, a midyear newsletter and a later update on new 
hosts. Members use the directory to make their own reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the modest rates, TravelClub members could find themselves staying in 
a waterfront home or along a golf course," said Mardi. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the hosts are retired and happy to help with travel and sightseeing 
advice about their area. There's always a warm welcome for mature travelers . . 
. just don't expect someone to carry your bags or spend the day with you." 
</P>
<P>
Mardi also serves as director of her mother's original Evergreen Club. 
</P>
<P>
Evergreen membership rates are the same -- $40 single, $50 double. But in 
addition to getting lower rates, Evergreen members also have more locations to 
choose from. 
</P>

I disagree with the advice given in an article on Washington, D.C. ("A Visit to 
Adams Morgan Neighborhood Area of Washington, D.C., Shows Good Taste," Dec. 2). 
</P>
<P>
Adams Morgan is no paradise and has no appeal. It is a city district that is 
dirty and crime-ridden. The restaurants are second-rate, the browsing is 
minimal and tacky, the entertainment, with the exception of tap dancer Johne 
Forge of Cafe Lautrec, is limited to the clubs mentioned by the author. Too bad 
she didn't warn your readers about the open drug dealing, ethnic gangs, high 
cover charges and pervasively lousy music.

American democracy, 1990: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In California, the people vote to lessen the power of the men and women who 
represent them in the Legislature by limiting the time they can serve. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In New Jersey, the governor answers pleas for leadership by producing laws 
and funding to improve the state's worst schools -- and destroys himself in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Washington, the two most recent chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
warn members of Congress that the country should avoid war because the military 
cannot do what Americans want done. 
</P>
<P>
All these events illustrate a breakdown of old-fashioned authority. That is the 
way democracy works in Post-Leadership America. 
</P>
<P>
This seems to be what Americans have been waiting for -- the chance to really 
try government by the people. It is not a question of initiative and 
referendum, California-style, although these blunt weapons are being used 
against politicians wherever possible. Rather, it is a question of more and 
more people wanting to exercise power themselves rather than delegating it to 
elected or anointed betters. 
</P>
<P>
Gridlock in Washington? People love it. If "they" fight among themselves, maybe 
they'll leave "us" alone. 
</P>
<P>
I have never really believed that Americans wanted "Leadership!" no matter how 
many demands for such mystical guidance I have heard in conversations and read 
in polls. It is like "family values." We talk about them so much because we 
don't have them. We are a nation of leavers, greatly preferring individual 
freedom and mobility to shared obligation since the days we left home and 
family in the Old World. 
</P>
<P>
"Government is best that governs least" goes back at least to Thomas Jefferson. 
And we have lived for more than 200 years under a Constitution that 
deliberately divides powers into branches, even twigs. When anyone of us says 
"leadership," we mean leadership by someone who agrees with us, or leadership 
that leads less. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the nation has accepted leadership in war and peace, and in other 
things, too. But that acceptance was often grudging and usually based on the 
resigned assumption that "they," our leaders, knew something the rest of us did 
not. Now, more and more Americans no longer believe that -- or are sure of it. 
More mobility, the communications revolution, particularly satellite television 
transmission, better education or, at least, more knowledge and national 
street-smarts, all are persuading many Americans that maybe we do know more 
than we thought we did. Or our leaders know less. 
</P>
<P>
What the people know and when they know it is the engine that drives the 
politics of a democracy. And control of the flow of information has been the 
greatest of presidential powers this century. But now, all of us and each of us 
know more and know it sooner. 
</P>
<P>
It is not only politicians who are finding that the half-lives of leadership 
seem to get shorter and shorter. That deterioration has been partly offset by a 
lowering of the standards by which leadership is judged. President Harry S. 
Truman's definition -- "Leadership is the ability to get men to do what they 
don't want to do and like it" -- has been transformed along the slippery slope 
of recent years to being interviewed by Ted Koppel or getting on the cover of a 
newsmagazine with a headline that indicates you seem to know what you're doing 
-- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
As power and fame come together, some future Andy Warhol will be able to to say 
that each American will be the leader for 15 minutes. Among the heroic leaders 
whose time passed this year were Lee Iacocca and Donald Trump. These two 
salesmen were defined as important, as daring and competent, in apposition to 
indecisive and evasive politicians. Iacocca and Trump were, in a sense, empty 
vessels filled by many -- especially editors and other professional worriers -- 
to make a point about the decline of political leadership. 
</P>
<P>
But it seems that empty vessels are exactly what people want. What used to be 
called "being all things to all men" is being transformed into "being all 
things to me -- for now." Leadership as wine-tasting. 
</P>
<P>
As Americans in the lonely crowd struggle to define themselves by wearing a 
Rolex or driving a Jeep or reading Vanity Fair, they can also attach themselves 
to political (or cultural) symbols -- Jesse Helms or Jesse Jackson, Jerry 
Falwell or Jerry Brown, Bill Cosby or Bart Simpson. The symbols come and they 
go. What they say or do, if they do anything at all of significance, is not the 
important thing. 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if they're Milli Vanilli, and people are going to check on whether 
or not this is lip-synching. In Post-Leadership America, those who once were 
followers now have greater choice: They can define and re-define themselves 
just as politicians always have, in the land of the free and the home of the 
brave, phony resume. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are trying to lead themselves by switching symbols, styles, channels 
or venues. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Florio, the governor of New Jersey, provided a lesson in why, given a 
choice, politicians prefer to let political consumers do with them what they 
will. Leaving aside the question of whether or not Florio deliberately misled 
the people about his intentions, within weeks of taking office he announced 
that the state was in real trouble and he was going to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the books were cooked, that phony numbers and other political 
accounting tricks had been used to hide billions of dollars in debt. Worse, the 
new governor said, schools in New Jersey's cities and poor rural areas were 
turning out functional illiterates, many of them dangerously anti-social. 
</P>
<P>
So, he pushed through legislation raising state income taxes on families making 
more than $80,000 a year and shifting revenues from prosperous suburban school 
districts to the poor schools. 
</P>
<P>
That might be called leadership. But that was not one of the words that leaped 
from the lips of Jersey's voting classes. 
</P>
<P>
The message for more traditional contemporary politicians was summarized by the 
senior U.S. senator from Florio's state, Bill Bradley. Asked how he intended to 
deal with the Florio furor, he replied: Stay out of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Getting involved with leadership was the last thing on Bradley's mind. It might 
be contagious. And that is how it will be. 
</P>
<P>
Military matters are one area in which political leaders have had some recent 
success in controlling the flow of information to the people they are leading 
-- by cutting it off totally for short periods of time. In blacking out almost 
all information for two or three days in the invasions of Grenada and Panama, 
the government developed (or stumbled into) an essentially psychological 
strategy that neutralized public reaction by, in effect, launching a surprise 
attack on the American people. In the controlled confusion at home, the 
government was able to substitute feelings for facts about less controlled 
confusion in the field. 
</P>
<P>
But rising public doubt and disenchantment about the Administration's gulf 
policy reveals the limits of information containment over time. It also shows 
the wisdom of President Bush's strategy of sharing power and responsibility 
from the start with other countries and the United Nations. The only place Bush 
did not feel compelled to deal at first was in the U.S. Congress. Members made 
it perfectly clear that they had not the slightest intention of saying or doing 
anything until orders came up from the public. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative bodies are like that, often inert, desperately turning leadership 
over to the courts when the going gets rough on issues. This time, the crudest 
declarations of Post-Leadership politics were Democratic senators and 
representatives who said they would only speak out after body bags starting 
coming back to their constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
If the President manages to come off looking like a determined and effective 
leader in his confrontation with Saddam Hussein -- perceived victory at costs 
acceptable to the American people -- that will almost certainly be because he 
accepted the limits or the leadership conceived by these same people. If he 
misunderstands or violates the limits -- if he is capable of exerting 
old-fashioned leadership -- he could not only find himself in a larger version 
of the Florio fix, destined for electoral defeat in 1992, but for impeachment 
talk in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of reaction is greatly speeded up now but it is not entirely new, and 
I don't believe it is a passing thing. Americans, individually, have always 
wanted to run things themselves and have been encouraged in that by the 
rhetoric and conviction of government governing least. Now, new mechanisms have 
provided more information -- and with it a certain individual confidence, or 
arrogance -- putting more of the levers of knowledge and power within the reach 
of most of the people, most of the time. More and more people are trying to 
beat the system. Or, the system, the Republic is being made new before our 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Political "leaders" can deal with that. Dealing is what they do, so long as 
part of the deal is their own reelection. And now even that may be in question 
in California -- and, soon enough, in the rest of Post-Leadership America, 
governed by the people for themselves.

FEDERALISM IS THE GREAT HEALER

<TEXT>
<P>
When the European Conference on Security and Cooperation convened in Paris last 
month, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned against "retrograde nationalisms" 
that could disrupt the building of the "common house" of Europe. He was calling 
attention to one of the many paradoxes that stud, like sequins, the debutante's 
gown of the New World Order as it struggles to fashion itself amid the ruins of 
the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
This gown could become the shirt of Nessus, which tears away the skin that 
wears it, unless forms of conciliation are found between the worldwide movement 
toward interdependence and the multiple nationalist tendencies that are now 
rising to contradict it. Nowhere is this truer than in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, it is extremely difficult to predict whether Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
will outlast the changes that he has so courageously initiated, or fall victim 
to his own Frankenstein. But the cat is out of the bag and is roaming a world 
of instant communications, available information and visual vocabulary. The new 
political grammar transforms walls into air, and iron curtains into windows of 
irony. 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviet crisis does point to one of the great paradoxes of the movements 
we are witnessing. The trilogy of economic interdependence, technological 
progress and instant communications can conceivably lead us all -- from Moscow 
to Madrid to Mexico City -- to a better world order of shared plenty. 
</P>
<P>
Yet hardly has this door been opened than, in much of the world, the problems 
of culture and ethnicity have riotously stepped in to break up the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The paradox: If economic rationality tells us that the next century will be the 
age of global integration of the world's national economies, cultural 
"irrationality" steps in to inform us that it will also be the century of 
ethnic demands and revived nationalisms. 
</P>
<P>
How can you quicken the step toward global integration if you have Ukrainians 
and Lithuanians, Georgians and Armenians, Moldavians and Azeris yapping at your 
heels, denying the principle of a worldwide integration of productive forces? 
This is where political and cultural imaginations must join together to ask: 
Can we conciliate global economic demands with the resurrection of these 
nationalistic claims? 
</P>
<P>
Both reason and imagination tell us that the name of the solution is 
federalism. 
</P>
<P>
My hope is that we will witness a re-evaluation of the federalist theme as a 
compromise between three equally real forces -- the nation, the region and the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
To this end, "The Federalist Papers" should be distributed in the millions. 
Although 200 years old, it may hold the secret to making the New World Order 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"The Federalist Papers" was written by three great North American statesmen, 
when there was such a thing: Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison. 
The applicability of their 85 essays is, of course, neither universal nor 
restricted to conditions in 1787. Madison, for example, addressed the human 
tendency toward factionalism. While clearly understanding that its causes were 
difficult to uproot, he proposed to control its effects. 
</P>
<P>
How? 
</P>
<P>
Through a seeming paradox: A strong national government, but controlled by 
checks and balances, separation of powers and federal diffusion of authority. 
You must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next 
place, oblige it to control itself. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to "The Federalist Papers," 13 factious little colonies of the English 
New World became a great modern nation. As the United States, Canada and Mexico 
today are designing a North American free-trade area, one wonders about the 
fate of the Iberoamerican republics to the south of the United States? Do they 
pose problems comparable to those we are seeing in the Balkans, Central and 
Eastern Europe -- not to mention Ireland and the Basque country, Brittany and 
Quebec? 
</P>
<P>
The world transformation has caught Latin America in a vicious crisis -- 
political, social, economic -- with scant resources to actively present 
ourselves in the new, multipolar order. 
</P>
<P>
Yet our contemporary crisis has made us realize that one thing endures in the 
midst of our political and economic failures. It is our cultural continuity, 
the multiracial and pluralistic culture we have created during the past 500 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to current events in Europe and Asia, cultural demands in Latin 
America do not disrupt the national or even the global rationalities. They 
reinforce them. 
</P>
<P>
If, in Eurasia, the problem is the conciliation of international integration 
with ethnic demands through a new federalist regime, in Latin America the 
problem is to conciliate economic growth with social justice through, again, a 
democratic federalism. 
</P>
<P>
Latin America has a peculiar advantage over other regions in today's world. Our 
national cultures coincide with the physical limits of each of our nations, 
even as our larger cultural boundaries embrace the Iberian peninsula -- Spain 
and Portugal -- and through them Europe; and even as our internal 
diversification includes Indian and black cultures. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing is that no local separatisms menace our national unity or 
our neighbors' territorial integrity. Our culture, precisely because it is so 
varied -- European, Indian, black -- does not propose religious fundamentalisms 
or ethnic intolerance. As the Venezuelan author Arturo Uslar Pietri puts it, 
even when we are purely white in Latin America (and whites are a minority), we 
are Indian and we are black. Our culture cannot be understood without all three 
components. We are mestizo -- a mixture of tastes, mores, memories and accents. 
</P>
<P>
What we do bear is profound social injustice. But because the national cultures 
are contained within the national boundaries, it is up to each of us to solve 
this problem through local politics. It is here that the federalist idea is 
quite relevant for Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, we have been ruled from the center and from the top. Today, 
emerging new civil societies -- from Mexico to Argentina -- propose rule from 
the bottom and from the outskirts of society. 
</P>
<P>
The mission of Latin American democracy is to conciliate both movements. 
Whether in Carlos Salinas de Gortari's Mexico, Alberto Fujimori's Peru or 
Fernando Collor de Mello's Brazil, we are trying to extend the republic, as 
Madison put it. 
</P>
<P>
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, it was widely believed that international 
resources previously earmarked for Latin America would now quickly shift to 
Central Europe and the Soviet Union. This has not happened. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of the Eastern European crisis -- nationalisms, separatisms, 
ethnic revolts and a 50-year backwardness in all aspects of economic life, from 
deteriorating infrastructures to wholesale ecocide -- has given us all pause. 
</P>
<P>
All this is making us realize that the problems of Eurasia, from the Elbe to 
the Pacific, require a major international effort comparable to the Marshall 
Plan. Massive new public investment is needed to boost communications, 
education, housing and a clean environment. 
</P>
<P>
In most of these respects, Latin America is more modern and developed. 
Comparatively, we have a better basis for attracting investment than Poland, 
Romania or even Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
As the dust of the critical '80s settles, we can judge our mistakes, but also 
our successes in historical perspective. Beginning with Battle in Uruguay, the 
Popular Front in Chile or Lazaro Cardenas in Mexico, the nation-state did 
create infrastructure, education, health and opportunities for the private 
sector throughout Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the state did become bloated. The private sector did become lazy and 
overprotected. Debt cut everyone's wings. But, as a result of our historical 
commitments, there is life after debt. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Latin America organizes her democratic existence and reforms her 
economic life, she has a great contribution to make to international relations. 
The end of the Cold War creates a new international context that demands 
cooperation, but refuses intervention. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of our difficult dealings with our powerful northern neighbor, few 
regions in the world have greater experience in diplomatic negotiation than 
Latin America. This has created a cultural tradition that stresses peaceful 
solution of controversies, diplomacy and adherence to international laws and 
treaties. 
</P>
<P>
If the federalist spirit becomes successfully ingrained at the national level 
in Latin America, it can perhaps play a role in uniting our republics in 
response to collective external challenges. 
</P>
<P>
A free-trading zone in this continent would seem to be the first stage. 
</P>
<P>
But we should not become fixated on "an initiative of the Americas." Europe and 
the Pacific are equally important. Indeed, might not a federal Iberoamerica be 
the bridge between Europe and the Pacific? 
</P>
<P>
Exactly 100 years ago, the Cuban patriot Jose Marti warned: "If we want to 
assure freedom, we must balance trade. A people who want to die trade with only 
one country. A people who want salvation trade with more than one."

WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS NOW -- EARS THAT LISTEN UP; 
</P>
<P>
RELATIONSHIPS: THE PROBLEM IS NOT SO MUCH A FAILURE TO TALK TO ONE ANOTHER AS 
IT IS A HESITANCY TO HEAR WHAT THE OTHER PERSON OR SIDE IS SAYING.

<TEXT>
<P>
Affairs of the world today bear an eerie resemblance to everyone's affairs of 
the heart. One side is not listening to the other. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern is clear, and it's pervasive. It is not so much a failure to talk 
to one another as it is a hesitancy to hear what the other person or side is 
really saying. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Tannen offers this thesis in her best-selling book, "You Just Don't 
Understand: Women and Men in Conversation." Tannen argues that couples talk 
past each other because language functions differently for men and for women. 
</P>
<P>
Men use language to assert independence in large groups, she says; women talk 
to try to achieve intimacy and support. Gender-based as Tannen's thesis is, it 
can also be a lens through which to view the world in conversation. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The polls, people across the country, influential senators and two retired 
generals have been telling George Bush that many Americans not only fear war, 
they also don't want armed conflict in the Middle East unless the objectives 
are more clearly drawn -- if then. One minute Bush appears to be listening, 
makes an appropriate gesture, and American hostages go free. 
</P>
<P>
The next minute, Bush and his whole Administration talk tough. Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney says that the only way to bring peace to the Persian Gulf 
is for Saddam Hussein to "go back to Baghdad with his tail between his legs." 
We may ultimately find out this bobbing and weaving was Administration 
strategy, but, meantime, the American people will have endured incredible 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The presidential candidates in Poland paid little heed to those who 
reminded them that dislike of politicians was as national a tradition as eating 
kielbasa. One front-runner was arrogant, the other exhausted and colorless. So 
out of the West came Stanislaw Tyminski, a curious amalgam of capitalism and 
mysticism, who forced Lech Walesa into a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa's Solidarity allies heard the danger signals and last Sunday gave Walesa 
the whopping majority he had predicted all along. The question: Has Walesa 
listened to those who still worry about his anti-democratic tendencies, or will 
he play the strongman? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cable News Network tangled with a federal judge over airing government 
tapes of telephone calls made by jailed Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega. 
CNN especially wanted to show that the government had violated Noriega's right 
to private conversations with his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
But Noriega wouldn't have been taped in the first place if he'd listened to his 
lawyer, Frank A. Rubino, who warned him about blabbing eight hours a day on the 
phone from his Miami jail cell. There's even a sign, in Spanish and in English, 
near the prison phones warning that calls are routinely monitored, unless they 
are conversations with lawyers.

 -- The New England Patriots heard complaints that reporter Lisa Olson was a 
"looker" in the locker room, that she was ogling the nude players. They 
checked, decided she only was doing her job and did nothing to stop the rumors 
-- until Olson was harassed by some nude players. Now the National Football 
League commissioner has completed an investigation and fined three players. 
Wouldn't it have been easier to listen earlier?

<P>
 -- Simon &amp; Schuster went on its merry way with Bret Easton Ellis' book 
"American Psycho," even though female employees strongly criticized the novel's 
graphic descriptions of violence against women. Only when the public-relations

would be in bad taste.

<P>
 -- For years, Californians have been warning Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and 
Co. that their arrogance, their perpetual interest in preserving their own jobs 
rather than passing legislation benefiting people instead of special interests

 -- Then there's Margaret Thatcher. She bullied those who wanted more 
integration with Europe -- until Europe finally threatened to leave her island, 
her England, behind forever. But she finally did listen to the signals in a

TO SUCCEED, ANY NEW CITY PLANNING CHIEF MUST HAVE A FREER HAND; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: WHOEVER GETS THE JOB OF PREPARING LOS ANGELES FOR ITS FUTURE CAN ONLY 
MANAGE IF ALLOWED TO REMAIN ABOVE POLITICS. THAT'S UNLIKELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Planning Director Kenneth Topping never could overcome the fact 
that smog, traffic congestion and other Southland ailments don't respect city 
boundaries. His replacement, whoever he or she will be, will succeed or fail 
only by coping with that fact and only if the political realities of the job 
change. The odds are long against that happy occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
Topping resigned this fall after an unsuccessful struggle with growth and 
congestion. Growth-control measures were approved. But so were huge housing 
tracts in the San Fernando Valley, as well as high-rises along Wilshire 
Boulevard and in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Growth and congestion were not, however, the immediate cause of Topping's 
departure. The municipal political labyrinth just proved too much for him, and 
he became an easy victim for a City Hall hit job. From the first, Topping was 
hobbled by city zoning laws and procedures that have made dealing with the 
Planning Department a nightmare. Anyone who's ever stood in line for 
information or a permit can testify to that. 
</P>
<P>
Topping had too many bosses -- Mayor Tom Bradley, the City Planning Commission 
(appointed by the mayor) and every member of the 15-seat City Council. If 
Topping had been a stronger person, he would have said no to the council 
members who overwhelmed his overworked department with requests for special 
ordinances and planning jobs for their districts. 
</P>
<P>
He lacked toughness and City Hall political smarts. If Topping could have built 
a political constituency among militant homeowners, he might have resisted the 
final assault by land developers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Topping didn't have the vision of his predecessor, Calvin Hamilton. 
Hamilton had proposed that commercial growth be limited to centers, such as the 
Westside's Century City and the San Fernando Valley's Warner Center. 
Growth-happy elected officials allowed rampant development of other commercial 
districts. But at least his concept provided a strong guide. 
</P>
<P>
Let's pretend, however, that the new planning chief has vision, political 
strength and faces none of the institutional obstacles that defeated Topping. 
</P>
<P>
We'll assume Mayor Bradley and the council, as a present to that yet-unchosen 
person, vows to simplify the zoning laws, and give the newcomer a free hand. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we'll make the impossible assumption that the new director, the mayor 
and the council will agree on some sort of city plan that restricts growth in 
the city's remaining pristine areas. Generations of a municipal laissez-faire 
attitude toward development would be forgotten. New zoning laws would save the 
mountaintops from further destruction and development would be channeled to 
areas where it's needed. 
</P>
<P>
But even if all that happened, the streets and freeways still would be jammed 
and the air polluted. A look at development in downtown Los Angeles explains 
why. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the City Council has given a clear field to downtown development. 
That hasn't changed since a stroke crippled the area's council representative, 
Gilbert Lindsay. Even with Lindsay hospitalized, the downtown development 
machine has churned on, driven by powerful lobbyists and developers. More 
high-rise office buildings have been approved despite warnings from 
middle-level Planning Department officials that the freeway and street system 
won't be able to handle the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
A good portion of the downtown work force comes from the city of Los Angeles -- 
from the harbor area, the Westside and the San Fernando Valley. But many also 
funnel through the San Gabriel Valley, arriving on the San Bernardino and 
Pomona Freeways. Downtown-bound vehicles from Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties also feed those crowded highways. More out-of-city traffic comes from 
the South, from Orange County and the cities of southeast Los Angeles County, 
pouring in on the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
A person trapped in downtown traffic probably curses City Hall. And the cursing 
wouldn't be entirely misdirected. City Hall approved the high-rises that 
attract the traffic. But those high-rises do create jobs that fuel the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The real solutions to the traffic jams are found outside City Hall -- at the 
Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, building new rail and bus transit 
lines for distant commuters; in other cities and counties that have encouraged 
growth; and with state highway builders who have to modernize the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Some relief is in sight. Voter approval of the Proposition C sales-tax increase 
last month will provide funds for the launching of two commuter rail lines to 
the San Fernando Valley and one to the San Gabriel Valley. In addition, 
there'll be money for expansion of bus service on the San Bernardino Freeway 
busway. 
</P>
<P>
For further help, the new planning director should be prepared to deal with 
governments outside Los Angeles, as well as with elected officials in City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
This may be the time for such an approach. The Legislature is considering a 
package of bills creating regional governmental agencies to deal with growth, 
traffic and air pollution. They were introduced last year, but went nowhere. 
This year, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, the author, has promised to push 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
The next planning director is going to have to be in the middle of such efforts 
or else the new chief's reign will be as difficult as Topping's was.

WORRIES ABOUT A BOOK; 
</P>
<P>
'AMERICAN PSYCHO' OUTRAGES MANY; WHAT TO DO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The line between free expression and censorship is a clear one. The social and 
political terrain that surrounds it, however, is extraordinarily treacherous -- 
marked not only by the well-known slippery slopes, but also by the quicksand of 
unintended consequence. 
</P>
<P>
These are thoughts worth holding in mind when one considers the controversy 
that has arisen over publication of "American Psycho," a new novel by the young 
writer Bret Easton Ellis, who enjoyed a brief flurry of celebrity following 
release of his first book, "Less Than Zero." That novel sketchily -- indeed, 
artlessly -- described the lives of a nihilistic circle of college-age 
hedonists. "American Psycho" is the story of a New York yuppie, who moves from 
Wall Street to serial murder. Among his victims are a number of women whose 
torture, mutilation and sexual abuse are recounted in chillingly brutish and 
prurient detail. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, when those passages were brought to the attention of officials 
at Simon &amp; Schuster, then-Ellis' publisher, they declined to bring the book 
out, though the author was allowed to keep his $300,000 advance. Shortly 
afterward, rights to the manuscript were acquired by Vintage Books, a division 
of Random House, which plans to publish in the spring. The decision to acquire 
"American Psycho" was made by Sonny Mehta, who is president not only of 
Vintage, but also of Alfred A. Knopf, one of America's most distinguished 
literary imprints. 
</P>
<P>
That fact has further incensed feminist groups, which already were outraged by 
a depiction of violence against women, which they believe constitutes an 
insensitive and dangerous affront. 
</P>
<P>
Led by the Los Angeles chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW), 
they are mounting a boycott not simply of "American Psycho," but also of all 
Random House books. NOW intends to press its boycott as a punitive measure, 
even if Vintage withdraws or alters the book, which currently is undergoing 
what is described by Ellis' agent as the "normal editing process at Knopf." 
</P>
<P>
The issue thus drawn is at a long step's remove from the question of official 
censorship. Rather, it involves the delicate and far more difficult question of 
how to maintain that tolerance indispensable to a free and civilized society 
without slipping into indifference, which is, after all, the enemy of every 
liberty worth exercising. This critical distinction -- between essential 
tolerance and coarse indifference -- is not an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
Making it begins with the candid admission that words and other forms of 
expression do matter. If they did not, the constitutional protection extended 
to them in the First Amendment of our Bill of Rights would be folly -- and the 
Founding Fathers were not fools. But that which has the power to edify, 
enlighten and ennoble also has the power to do harm. 
</P>
<P>
Mid-19th-Century America, for example, had two towering best sellers of its 
own. One was Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin," which helped rouse 
the conscience of a recalcitrant nation to the fundamental evils of chattel 
slavery. By 1857, it had sold 500,000 copies, a staggering number for the time. 
</P>
<P>
Its companion in commercial success was a different sort of book, Maria Monk's 
"Awful Disclosures." It purported to be the memoirs of a young woman who, after 
converting to Roman Catholicism, entered a convent where she was forced into 
clerical concubinage, orgies and the ritual murder of children. 
</P>
<P>
"Awful Disclosures" went through 20 printings, sold more than 300,000 copies 
and, as the bible of the Nativist movement, helped foment deadly anti-Catholic 
violence in Boston and Philadelphia. To this day, it enjoys a minor vogue among 
certain fundamentalist bigots, much as another notorious forgery, "Protocols of 
the Elders of Zion," continues to do among primitive anti-Semites. 
</P>
<P>
Yet turbulent, violent, deeply divided 19th-Century America survived "Awful 
Disclosures" as it benefited from "Uncle Tom's Cabin." If the former had been 
suppressed as a provocative calumny, what of the latter?

Whatever else can be said about Hussein, with the release of the hostages it is 
clear that he is a brilliant political as well as military strategist. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration appears angrier than the day Iraq invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has tried so hard to show his ability to control world opinion 
through the media like his predecessor, but has been upstaged by everyone from 
Mikhail Gorbachev to Hussein. Much like the NASA scientists and their faulty 
telescopes, Bush is discovering there are no absolute fail-safe formulas for 
dealing with the modern world in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush decides to take military action against Iraq to "declaw" its military 
capabilities, I suggest he then establish Iraq as a Palestinian homeland.

<P>
To correct an error in the letter regarding euthanasia (Dec. 2), it was of 
course not Plato who drank the hemlock but Socrates. 
</P>
<P>
He was not "executed for crimes against Athens," but drank the hemlock 
voluntarily as a final gesture of honor for having offended the city by 
speaking the truth, as he saw it, concerning the gods. 
</P>
<P>
The Hemlock Society also attempts to tell the truth as it sees it, which is 
that it is inhumane cruelty to prolong the degradation, pain and agony of 
terminally ill people who beg for release from intolerable suffering. No 
compassionate person would let a dog or any other animal without hope of 
recovery needlessly suffer a slow, agonizing inevitable death. Yet this is 
precisely what is done to humans who have not had the foresight to prepare a 
living will and a durable power of attorney for health care while they are 
still of sound mind and body.

The U.S. Supreme Court justices ought to have their heads examined for their 
decision on redistricting in Los Angeles County ("High Court Clears Way for 
Vote in 1st District," Metro, Dec. 11). The whole theme of America is based on 
freedom and equality -- where each and every person has an equal chance 
regardless of race, color, religion, sex or age. 
</P>
<P>
America is a melting pot of all people on this planet. 
</P>
<P>
Why do Latinos need to have "their" district? Aren't they Americans of Latino 
descent just like the rest of us who are proud Americans descended of European, 
African, Asian and every other country of this world? 
</P>
<P>
If you don't like who your elected representatives are, then vote them out, but 
don't create ethnic "ghetto government" for "Latinos only." That's un-American 
and will only divide people.

GORBACHEV IS FLUSH WITH CASH; U.S. AID WILL ONLY HELP HIS STRATEGIES OF 
REPRESSION.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. BUCHANAN, Patrick J. Buchanan writes a syndicated column in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Had Republicans in 1988 told voters we would be raising taxes to send foreign 
aid to Moscow, even the Little Duke might have been able to slip around our 
right end and run to daylight. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, here we are. Six months ago, Majority Leader Richard Gephardt took a 
fearsome pounding for even suggesting what Mr. Bush has decided to do: send $1 
billion in food aid to Mr. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, whose friend and contributor is Dwayne Andreas of the 
grain giant Archer Daniels Midland, suggests we raise Moscow's food-related 
loan guarantees to $3 billion. Fine, Bob, but when Moscow welshes, let Andreas 
and ADM eat the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Astonishing. With the dollar sinking, the deficit exploding, the Fed feverishly 
pumping cash into a failing Bank of New England, the S&amp;L crisis deepening, 
the Persian Gulf adventure doubling in cost, Uncle Sam is launching a new 
foreign-aid initiative -- to rescue the last dictator between San Francisco and 
Vladivostok. 
</P>
<P>
Were the Russian people starving, Americans would be there with food 
assistance. But they are not starving. They just had the greatest harvest in 
history, and Gorbachev's gang is flush with cash. Moscow's $4-billion windfall 
profit from the doubling of oil prices, its $24 billion in credits since June 
from the Germans and Saudis, plus $10 billion to $14 billion in reserves, give 
Gorbachev all the cash he needs. Why, then, are we sending him food on credit? 
</P>
<P>
Because Bush wishes to signal to the Soviets that Gorbachev is our man in 
Moscow, that saving him serves U.S. national interests. 
</P>
<P>
But does it, in December, 1990? 
</P>
<P>
Surely, the Gorbachev who held back the tanks in Central Europe in 1989 was the 
best Soviet leader of our lifetime. Ronald Reagan was right: Gorbachev was a 
"different kind" of Communist. Were he to preside over the dismantling of the 
Soviet strategic rocket force and the opening up of his "prison house of 
nations," his regime would be as wise a strategic investment as the United 
States could make. But there is no evidence that Gorbachev intends to preside 
over the liquidation of the Soviet Empire; there is hard evidence that he is 
aligning with the imperialist factions determined to save it. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet military still consumes 20% of GNP; Soviet tanks have been moved 
east of the Urals to exempt them from U.S. arms-control agreements; Soviet 
rockets -- aimed at the United States -- continue to roll off assembly lines. 
Moreover, Gorbachev has lately declared his intent to use force to keep the 
Soviet Union together. At the top of the Interior Ministry sits a newly 
appointed ex-KGB tough from Latvia, Boris Pugo, whose deputy, Gen. Boris 
Gromov, has the aspect of a Russian Napoleon. There is a good possibility that 
just as U.S. food aid is pouring into Moscow this winter, Gromov will be 
conducting a blockade of one or more Baltic republics. 
</P>
<P>
In the battle between neo-Stalinists and reform Communists, Gorbachev was with 
the reformers. We had an investment in his victory. But that fight is over. The 
battle now is between those who believe in constitutional rights, free markets 
and independence for the republics, and those prepared to use force to keep 
Russia's captive nations captive forever. Gorbachev is emerging as the leader 
and voice of the forces of repression. 
</P>
<P>
His regime -- with its huge Marxist bureaucracy -- is now the impediment to 
reform. As former National Security Council aide Roger Robinson of the Center 
for Security Policy writes, the Soviet Union is referred to by American bankers 
as "Red Bear S&amp;L." It should be shut down, its managers fired, its assets 
parceled out. To stuff Moscow full of cash and credit in 1990 is to give this 
failed regime the same lease on life we gave Lenin in the '20s, Stalin in the 
'40s, Brezhnev in the '70s. This time, don't bail 'em out, let 'em go under. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Commodity Credit Corporation loans to Poland in the '70s, and to Iraq 
in the '80s, we will never see the money again; all that subsidized food will 
have to be paid for by the American people. 
</P>
<P>
By denying aid to Gorbachev, we could force him to act in his own best 
interest. Without hard currency, he could not pay his bureaucrats, maintain his 
arsenal, send aid to Cuba and Afghanistan, operate his state farms and 
factories. Without aid, he must open his country to investment or go under. You 
do the alcoholic no favor when you give him a drink; you do him a favor when 
you put him through cold turkey. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush put America's prestige behind Deng Xiaoping, and, until Aug. 2, 
behind Saddam Hussein; he was burned by both. With this aid package, he ties 
himself to a dictator who just may reward him with a crackdown that will cause 
us to forget Tian An Men Square.

STOP THE HOARDING

By TULLEY N. BROWN is executive director of Direction Sports, a program that 
combines sports and academics to help inspire self-worth in disadvantaged 
inner-city youth. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prospects (for helping inner-city youth in America) are not good. (For 
instance,) the problem of food in Russia is paradoxical in that they've had the 
best wheat harvest in 20 years, but farmers are hoarding. 
</P>
<P>
They don't trust the marketplace and they figure if they let the people really 
starve and so on, then they can get higher prices, make some more money. 
</P>
<P>
In America, it's like that. We're trying to entrench, or hoard, our largess. 
For someone to step out and say, "Damn! Let's give your young a piece of the 
action, let's give our young a chance to experience. They're needed and 
valuable" (just isn't happening like it should). 
</P>

In our program, we show that love is helping someone like themselves. And that 
concept is so simple, it's difficult for people to grasp. It's from that 
universal truth that people blossom, people self-actualize. And it's from the 
lack of that today that we have the antithesis of self-actualization and 
blossoming. We have destructiveness.

EUROPEAN REVERIE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The rich patina of age glows from the rooms of designer Linda Chase's home. 
Wrought-iron Gothic-revival torchiers stand in front of terra-cotta-colored 
silk draperies bound with 19th-Century gold cords. 
</P>
<P>
An Old Master painting hovers over three clay putti standing atop a 
18th-Century hand-painted Italian desk. It's an environment so steeped in the 
textures of the past that a colleague of Chase, seeing a photo of one of the 
rooms, asked which European country the house was in. He was startled to learn 
that he was looking at Chase's recently restored 1927 home in the Hollywood 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Purchased a year-and-a-half ago, the house once belonged to a Canadian opera 
singer. "There was an existing fairy-tale quality to the house with its 
medieval weather vane, turreted roof line and small-paned windows: I just 
enhanced that magical quality," Chase explains. Letting the bones of the house 
guide her, she left it as undisturbed as possible. The woodwork remained 
untouched except for a lone living-room beam that was beyond repair: She 
painted it parchment and then embellished it with hand-painted cartouches. The 
major face lift for the house came in the multilayered paint scheme: It's the 
layers of paint that give the walls depth and opalescence. The living room, for 
example, takes its color from a parchment base diluted with an Italianate blue 
then tinted with three additional ochre glazes. 
</P>
<P>
Against that backdrop, she's arranged an inspired collection of genuine 
antiques and reproductions. "I mix all kinds of things if I feel the effect is 
right," explains Chase, who works with clients worldwide and wrote the recently 
released book "In the Romantic Style." Armfuls of cut flowers and candles 
create a peaceful reverie -- "a world," Chase says, "that's in a different 
point in time." BARBARA THORNBURG

AFTER A YEAR, KIDNAPING IS STILL A MYSTERY; 
</P>
<P>
BLEAK CHRISTMAS: FAMILY IS NOT CELEBRATING AS A TRAIL OF CLUES IN THE ABDUCTION 
OF LETICIA HERNANDEZ, 8, OF OCEANSIDE HAS HIT A DEAD END IN THE WILDS OF 
NORTHERN FLORIDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Her gifts from last Christmas sit unopened, and sometimes her little brother 
cries out for her in the night. But always, there is no answer. 
</P>
<P>
One year and thousands of police leads later, Leticia Hernandez, 8, is still 
missing, and, if she is still alive, is believed to be anywhere in heavily 
forested northern Florida with the kidnapers who grabbed her from an Oceanside 
street a year ago today. 
</P>
<P>
"In other homes there will be parties and happiness, but not here," Leticia's 
mother said softly in Spanish. "There will be no Christmas, there will be 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
It has been a whole year of soaring hopes and crashing disappointments for the 
mother, also named Leticia, after 18 sightings of her child abruptly ended last 
May, when the trail vanished into the Florida outback. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside Police Department spokesman Bob George said the 14 investigators who 
once gumshoed the kidnaping have now dwindled to one dedicated and hard-working 
detective who needs a break in the frustrating case. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though there are no verifiable leads or sightings doesn't mean we're 
disheartened," George said. "With a case like this, you just can't quit." 
</P>
<P>
Leticia, or "Tita" as her family affectionately calls her, had wandered from 
the Hernandezes' cramped apartment on Bush Street and headed for a local park 
while her mother was distracted by chores. The girl never returned. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the national media coverage, the descriptions of two suspected 
abductors, the once-promising trail of sightings, the blizzard of leaflets with 
Leticia's photograph -- all have failed to deliver the Hernandez family from 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it has been difficult to go on, but I have to go on for the sake of my 
family," said the girl's 33-year-old mother, who shares the family apartment 
with Leticia's sister, five brothers and grandmother. Leticia's father is a 
farmworker in the Sacramento area. 
</P>
<P>
Time has been an oppressive blur of the past and present, of two Christmases 
made bitter and cruel. 
</P>
<P>
When Leticia disappeared, the family kept the decorated Christmas tree, hoping 
that, once she returned they'd celebrate a Christmas of joyful reunion. The 
months slowly passed, and finally the dry and sadly drooping tree was taken 
away in the summer. The presents from that Christmas remain stacked at the edge 
of the living room. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is Christmas time again, but this year, Hernandez said, "There will not 
even be a tree." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Christmas reminders are especially hard, Leticia's absence haunts 
the family every day, especially 5-year-old brother Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
"Daniel called her at night and looked for her," grandmother Victoria Gonzalez 
de Hernandez said. "He'd wake up crying." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tears, the children believe Leticia will return one day, their 
mother said. Her eighth birthday was Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though they are young, they understand what is happening," Hernandez 
said. "They don't ask questions because they know what is going on, but they 
say she is going to return." 
</P>
<P>
It will be difficult, if and when the time comes, to tell 6-month-old Michael, 
the brother Leticia doesn't yet know she has, about the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said, "I haven't thought of what I'm going to tell him because he 
still does not understand. But, when he asks, I have proof and many things (to 
show him) so that he can see and understand what has happened." 
</P>
<P>
She said Oceanside police investigators have regularly called or visited her 
when they've gotten reliable information. 
</P>
<P>
"They have always told us they do not want to give us false hopes or news. When 
they are sure, they come and let me know," Hernandez said. The investigators 
still drop by, although they haven't had promising news for more than six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The mother prays often and waits. 
</P>
<P>
Police are waiting, too. 
</P>
<P>
Between the day of the kidnaping and last May 22, Leticia was spotted 18 times 
at rest stops, gas stations, campgrounds and the like between Buckman Springs 
east of San Diego and High Springs, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Her abductors are described as a Caucasian male, age 30 to 35, about 5-foot-10, 
220 to 150 pounds, with blond, shoulder-length hair and a cross tattooed on the 
back of one hand, and a female accomplice in her mid-30s with bleached blond, 
collar-length hair, standing 5-feet 10-inches and weighing about 130 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
On one occasion, the couple was observed with another woman described as white, 
in her mid 40s with slightly graying curly brown hair. 
</P>
<P>
George said, "We still believe they're probably in the northern Florida area. 
The problem is, it's a densely forested, swampy area. She could be 10 feet from 
somebody, and they'd never see her." 
</P>
<P>
George said police are assuming Leticia still is alive simply because, "We 
don't have anything to tell us she's not alive." 
</P>
<P>
She is believed to be in the northern Florida area because the leads still 
coming in are mostly from that area, George said, "but there's nothing we can 
say is a sighting." 
</P>
<P>
George said investigators, including the FBI, which has an agent on the case, 
need a break to get further. "We've needed that from the beginning," George 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Any promising tips are checked, a time-consuming process. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside Police Lt. Ron Call spent most of Tuesday dealing with a brief spot 
on television's "A Current Affair" that showed a woman sought in connection 
with a series of killings in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers phoned the station to report that the woman resembled Leticia's 
kidnaper, and Call wound up spending hours checking the information and fending 
off reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the composite (drawing) looks close, but there's no connection with the 
Leticia Hernandez case," he said. "We're not even investigating whether they're 
linked at all." 
</P>
<P>
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has gotten tips 
regularly on the case, hundreds of them since the kidnaping, according to Bob 
Ermini, the center's director of case management. 
</P>
<P>
The center, cooperating with Oceanside police, has helped print and distribute 
in Florida 250,000 flyers with Leticia's picture. 
</P>
<P>
At home, one of the many people who have taken a personal interest in Leticia 
is Oceanside police Officer Chris McDonough, who recorded a song to help raise 
reward money to solve the case. The reward fund stands at $18,500. 
</P>
<P>
McDonough, who is chairman of San Diegans for the Return of Leticia Hernandez, 
said he believes the girl is alive because most kidnaped children are never 
seen again after their abduction. 
</P>
<P>
The Hernandez family is already planning for Leticia's return. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have her forget," her grandmother said, "and have her forget the 
people she was with . . . and live a normal life like before."

TRAGEDY: SURVIVORS ARE ANGRY OVER OFFICIAL FINDING OF ACCIDENTAL DEATH BY

<P>
Families of the 12 people who died in a spiritualist prayer meeting gone awry 
held wakes for their dead Saturday, disbelieving and angry at the official 
finding that the victims died of accidental asphyxiation brought on by a 
malfunctioning butane lantern. 
</P>
<P>
"Put down that justice needs to be done here, that someone is to blame and that 
somehow those of us who did not die will find an answer," said Fidel Mondragon, 
61, who was one of an extended family of 20 who came from East Los Angeles to 
mourn and bury his daughter, her husband, and both their children. 
</P>
<P>
Tijuana coroner's officials declared Friday that, based on preliminary 
autopsies, the 12 had died of carbon monoxide poisoning after being enclosed in 
a four-room house during an overnight religious ceremony led by Federico Padres 
Mexia, a 61-year-old self-styled spiritualist. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely an accident," a deputy prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, however, doctors attending six people who survived the ceremony 
appeared nearly as skeptical of the official cause of death as the victims' 
relatives. Two of the survivors may have been bruised or beaten during the 
evening rite. Others, doctors said, suffered unexplained burns. 
</P>
<P>
"As a doctor, it's hard for me to accept carbon monoxide as the exclusive 
explanation," said Dr. Ariel Perez Munoz, director of Social Security Clinic 
20, a public hospital. Doctors said all the survivors had symptoms, such as 
highly acidic blood and a swelling of the eyes, that were not necessarily 
caused by carbon monoxide poisoning alone. 
</P>
<P>
Perez Munoz suggested that a combination of factors -- including carbon 
monoxide, methanol possibly ingested during the ceremony and perhaps another 
poison -- probably caused the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Blood samples have been turned over to the San Diego Medical Examiner for 
further tests, but Perez Munoz stressed that they may be inconclusive because 
the victims were found several hours after they had fallen unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that we are never going to find an explanation of exactly what 
occurred," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives gathered Saturday at the government-run funeral home -- where burial 
services were provided for about $250 a person -- seeking someone or something 
to blame. Most were convinced someone -- whether part of a suicidal mission or 
murder -- had tried to kill their families. 
</P>
<P>
If the 12 died from a lantern, they asked, why were screams of pain coming from 
Mexia's house that night? Why did a the daughter of one of the victims stand 
guard and refuse to let anyone in, claiming Jesus Christ was descending? Why 
did a survivor speak of drinking from a fruit punch that made people sick? 
</P>
<P>
"We're poor people, we're humble people, but we won't let them fool us into 
believing that this was an accident," said Jesus Moreno, who lost a 14-year-old 
sister and whose mother is in a coma. "I plan to fight this. This is a great 
injustice." 
</P>
<P>
Answers to the mystery may lie with the six survivors, but three, including 
Mexia, are in apparently irreversible comas. The other survivors are an 
8-month-old baby and two men who remain semi-coherent and who may have suffered 
some brain damage, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
One is Moises Merida Gonzalez, 32, who had lain incoherent until Saturday, when 
he spoke, for the first time, with a reporter. He had a black eye and other 
facial injuries. Asked what had happened to him, he answered only, "I was 
beaten." Then he sat up and pulled his shirt over his head. 
</P>
<P>
Merida Gonzalez was the only victim who was not found in Mexia's home on 
Thursday morning. He arrived at the hospital that night, and told medical staff 
that he had escaped from the ritual during the night. 
</P>
<P>
Survivor Alfredo Osuna Hernandez, 22, whose wife is one of the dead, is still 
dazed by the grief and the after-effects of the rite. He said in a short 
interview Saturday that he did not understand what had caused the tragedy. He 
had a cut on his face and bruises on his shoulder, but said he could not 
remember how he got them. The last thing he could remember was several people, 
including his wife, starting to vomit. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the group didn't disband and go for help, he said, "We could not 
leave, it would be harmful." No one, he added, wanted to leave. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived at Mexia's house early Wednesday evening for a ceremony in which he 
hoped to ask the Virgin Mary for help in finding a job. He had been attending 
the spiritualist's rituals for about four months and said he had already seen 
the Virgin and God at some of those sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Mexia promised a special session on Dec. 12, however, because it was the feast 
of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico. "He (Mexia) said we 
would see many things. The Virgin. God. Saints. Many things." 
</P>
<P>
Others who had attended the sessions said they generally opened with Mexia 
offering a brand of perfume called "Siete Machos" to the worshipers to rub on 
themselves as part of a ritual "cleansing." Afterward, they said, he would 
usually introduce a "medium" through whom God would speak. The medium, often a 
woman, would stand in front of an armchair and appear to allow God to speak 
through her, they said. 
</P>
<P>
For the feast of Guadalupe, Mexia had promised a "more powerful" medium who 
coming from Rosarito Beach. That medium was identified by Osuna as Benita 
Rosales Villalpando, of Rosarito Beach. She and her husband are among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
At some point -- Osuna's recollection of the sequence of events remains murky 
-- the participants drank punch and began praying. A short time later, Mexia 
poured alcohol over a tray of what he described as salts and neighbors said 
smelled like sulfur, and set it on fire. It smelled foul, Osuna said. 
</P>
<P>
Osuna said the "spirit of the Virgin" then appeared and entered Rosales' body. 
</P>
<P>
"She fainted," Osuna said. "Don Federico said not to worry, that it was not a 
problem and that she would wake up." 
</P>
<P>
The woman did awake a few minutes later, but was vomiting, Osuna said. Soon, 
several in the room were fainting or retching. At the same time, several of the 
participants started screaming in pain. 
</P>
<P>
"A force comes over you, you cannot help but scream," Osuna said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, no one tried to seek help, Osuna said. They were all seated inside a large 
rope circle with 13 knots, and Mexia had told them leaving would be "harmful" 
and break the spell. 
</P>
<P>
Osuna, who frequently lost his train of thought as he spoke, said one of the 
last things he remembers was trying to aid his wife. "I tried to lift her, but 
I couldn't." Dizziness and nausea overcame him, and he passed out. 
</P>
<P>
Just what kept those 18 people in that room may be at least as much to blame 
for their deaths as the carbon monoxide or methanol or whatever else caused 
their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Mexia's brand of spiritualism struck a chord among some in the poor 
neighborhood. Those who attended his prayer sessions were among literally 
millions of people who have immigrated in recent decades to Baja California, 
where wages are among the highest in the country. They wind up in neighborhoods 
like Colonia Mariano Matamoros, impromptu settlements of dirt streets, scrawny 
dogs and tar-paper homes that spill over whole hillsides as the population 
swells. 
</P>
<P>
Mexia drove into the colonia several months ago with enough money to build a 
four-room home with real stucco walls and a small satellite dish on top. Though 
he was apparently little more than a retired cement mason with a bad heart and 
a $100,000 home in Sun City, Calif., word circulated through the neighborhood 
that he could earn $4,000 a day north of the border. 
</P>
<P>
What was so compelling about him, and other self-styled seers, was that he 
offered an explanation of why workers remain unemployed, why the prayers of the 
faithful went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
They were living under a spell of bad luck, he said, and he could cleanse them 
of the bad luck. Then Jesus Christ himself would descend right into their very 
neighborhood, and after it was over, hotels would spring up and jobs would 
appear and the Colonia Mariano Matamoros would be famous. 
</P>
<P>
"He said God would come to us, that one could ask things from God and then have 
good luck," said Ramon Sarabia, who attended one session with his late mother a 
few weeks ago. "People thought they would end up being better off." 
</P>
<P>
One by one, people of the Colonia Mariano Matamoros came. The man who owned the 
neighborhood tortilla shop was one of the first to meet Mexia. With his 
tortillas, he delivered Mexia's message. First he brought his wife, who brought 
their son, who brought his girlfriend, who brought her sisters, who brought 
their mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
For most, little came of efforts to improve their lots. As their relatives 
would describe it, they had worked their hardest, and still not been able to 
escape poverty. Salsipuedes, goes an old Mexican saying frequently repeated in 
such colonias. "Get out if you can." The saying is both a dare and a commentary 
on fate. Try and get out, it taunts, but you never will. 
</P>
<P>
Those who attended Mexia's ceremonies were devout Roman Catholics. Most went to 
Mass Wednesday to celebrate the Feast of Guadalupe. They prayed, Osuna said, to 
the Virgin of Guadalupe and to Juan Diego, the Indian who saw her image. 
</P>
<P>
Mourners who gathered Saturday at the public mortuary found it inconceivable 
that Mexia's odd religious rite did not have something to do with the carnage. 
Poison potions, drugs, and other insidious substances -- among these the 
answers could be found, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone wanted to kill them," declared Felipe Osuna, 24, who lost his wife and 
whose younger brother and 4-month-old daughter are recuperating. 
</P>
<P>
At the Funeraria Santa Estela in the Zona Norte, the crowded neighborhood that 
is the last stop for many immigrants planning to "jump" the border, four bodies 
lay side-by-side, the family of the tortilla shop owner. Twenty relatives of 
his wife, Elodia Mondragon, had come from Los Angeles. They had bought a new 
white dress to bury Elodia in, and a pink ruffled one for her daughter, Monica, 
11. 
</P>
<P>
The family spent Friday night at the funeral home, keeping vigil over the four 
bodies, which were safeguarded by two large electric candelabra that cast a 
pink light over everything. Outside, a street fair celebrating the feast of the 
Guadalupe went on, raucous, full of music, sizzling tacos and the lights of 
Ferris wheels. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths prompted Roman Catholic Bishop Emilio Carlos Berlie to renew 
previous calls for federal controls on evangelical and other religious sects 
that have proliferated in poor neighborhoods of Tijuana and elsewhere in 
Mexico. Roman Catholic leaders have long charged that the sects -- which are 
mostly affiliated with U.S.-based Protestant denominations -- have enticed 
prospective converts by offering homes, money, food, and other necessities. 
</P>
<P>
Though he used evangelical techniques, Mexia told people he was a Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
Baja California Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel also has called for a state 
investigation into the events, including an inquiry into underlying 
social-economic factors.

PEACE GROUP TELLS STUDENTS THINGS RECRUITERS DON'T MENTION

<P>
Margaret Difani joined the Navy in 1975 and spent the next four years as a 
secretary. Today, she tells high school students that her stint in the military 
wasn't an adventure. It was just a desk job. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Johnston spent eight months, 10 days, 16 hours and 20 minutes in Vietnam as 
a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division. He saw several friends die 
there. Today, he volunteers his time to let young people know that he is still 
trying to figure out why. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hall spent from 1968 to 1972 in the Army mortuary service, processing 
the bodies of servicemen killed in Vietnam. When he came home, he became an 
Army recruiter, enlisting so many people that he earned a gold badge. Today, he 
travels around the county telling teen-agers they don't have to buy what 
military recruiters are selling. 
</P>
<P>
These veterans don't wear uniforms. They boast no catchy slogans and have no 
contracts for students to sign. But make no mistake -- like their nemeses, the 
military recruiters, these men and women have their own hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
They are peace recruiters -- members of a tiny Encinitas-based network called 
the Project on Youth and Non-Military Opportunities, or Project YANO. Since 
1984, they have spoken to thousands of students in dozens of schools around San 
Diego County, pitching an unconventional brand of patriotism that says you can 
serve your country without ever firing a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Especially in recent months, as the military build-up in the Persian Gulf 
raises the possibility of U.S. troops going to war, Project YANO's message has 
taken on a new urgency. But its mission, members say, remains the same: to tell 
kids what the military won't. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not here to tell you what you should or shouldn't do or what you should 
or shouldn't think," Rick Jahnkow, Project YANO's program coordinator, told 
about 300 juniors and seniors at Torrey Pines High School this week. "What 
we're going to give you today is not a balanced presentation -- you're already 
getting the other side. We're here to . . . fill in the blanks." 
</P>
<P>
Military recruiters who speak only of adventure, travel, education and job 
training leave out a few things, Jahnkow says. Among them, he says: the racism 
and sexism many enlistees experience; the low-tech jobs that often lie behind 
the high-tech terms in recruiting literature; and the possibility, implicit but 
in his eyes often under-stressed, that joining the military means risking your 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about Hawaii, Guam, places like that," says one veteran in a 
15-minute slide show that is part of Project YANO's presentation. "We're 
talking about Lebanon, Grenada, Iran, Iraq -- places with violence." 
</P>
<P>
Another veteran adds: "Videogames don't prepare you for that 10-year-old body 
all torn to pieces. And for the knowledge that you were part of the military 
machine that caused it." 
</P>
<P>
Jahnkow, a long-time anti-war activist who never served in the military, says 
Project YANO espouses no particular political viewpoint. The eight veterans 
that make up his speaking pool say that even they don't agree about the role of 
the military or the justness of war. What they share, however, is a belief that 
teen-agers need help figuring it out. 
</P>
<P>
The military has them completely outflanked. This year, the armed services 
combined will spend $2.86 billion on recruiting nationwide, including $203 
million for advertising, Pentagon officials say. Project YANO's annual budget, 
which stays balanced only because the veterans donate their time, hovers around 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
So, like any clever underdog, Jahnkow has tried to turn weakness to advantage. 
The military's recruiting campaign is so pervasive, he tells teen-agers, that 
he need not repeat it to them. We've all heard the ads, he says: slogans like, 
"Be all that you can be" and "We don't ask experience, we give it." All he asks 
is that kids think more critically, ask more questions and make up their own 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really selling them a method rather than an idea," said George Grider, a 
former Navy officer who is a Project YANO speaker. "Reason and patience and 
caring -- if they can learn those things, we like to think they will choose 
non-military opportunities. But if they don't, at least they will be choosing 
for their own reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Project YANO suggests several alternative ways for young people to express 
their love of country. Among them, joining the Job Corps and the Conservation 
Corps, entering youth training programs or vocational schools. But Jahnkow 
acknowledges that, where his group offers suggestions, the military can offer a 
paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
In part for that reason, military recruiters in the area appear largely 
unthreatened by Project YANO's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't affected us at all," said Sgt. Joe Steele, a public affairs 
officer for Marine Corps Recruiting Station San Diego. He said recruiters in 
his office view Project YANO's speakers as "disgruntled vets. They got some bum 
scoop, or their experience when they went into the service was negative, so 
they're taking that into the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers counter that the veterans have proved to be valuable catalysts for 
debate. They say that, by challenging students' perceptions of what a career in 
the armed services can offer, Project YANO forces them to confront what's 
important to them -- sometimes for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"None of these kids have any idea that they'd be called on to kill. They have 
very little experience with death, with having to give up anything," said 
Darlene Palmer, an English teacher at Torrey Pines High School, said after a 
recent Project YANO visit. "This is what education is all about." 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the bottom line of Project Yano is: get informed," said Michael 
Mangin, a history teacher at San Dieguito High School. "There's conflict, 
there's difference of opinion, and the class has to work through that. It's a 
terrific learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
One year, Mangin says, Project YANO prompted students to form a small political 
discussion group. Another year, Jahnkow and his crew came to class after one of 
Mangin's students already had decided to join the Navy. After hearing their 
presentation and asking several questions, the student didn't change his mind. 
But he told Mangin he was glad he'd been forced to articulate his convictions. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt more confident about it, having been challenged," Mangin said. 
</P>
<P>
Often the kids challenge the speakers right back, critiquing their political 
biases and their patriotism. At Torrey Pines High School this week, for 
example, the 16- and 17-year-olds were full of questions. How do you go about 
proving you're a conscientious objector? Can you be drafted if you're not an 
American citizen? Without military recruiters to enlist new soldiers, who would 
defend the United States? 
</P>
<P>
"You're not really against the military," one student chided. "You're just 
against what it does. If the military fit into your personal political beliefs, 
you'd be all for it." 
</P>
<P>
Another student approached Jahnkow later to say he felt he could serve in the 
military in some capacities, but not in combat. When Jahnkow informed him that 
he would not necessarily be allowed to choose his job, he grimaced with 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a choice?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Critical or not, each question represents a victory, Jahnkow says. If the 
students apply the same skepticism to everything they hear, Project YANO will 
have accomplished its aim. 
</P>
<P>
"When students say, 'Aren't you being unpatriotic,' I say, 'Veterans don't 
fight wars so that people can just wave the flag. We fight for those basic 
principles of being able to speak your mind,' " said Hall, the former military 
recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
"When they come up and say we're a bunch of hippie-commie-freaks, were 
thrilled," Grider said. "It shows they're listening."

SAY SOMETHING NICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, my husband and I decided to leave behind the hassles of Los 
Angeles living and move to Leucadia. 
</P>
<P>
Having come from a small town originally, North County seemed to fulfill our 
dreams of returning to a simpler life. We purchased a small motel on Highway 
101 and started a seven-day-a-week, 24-hour-a-day commitment to transforming a 
roadside location into a full-scale, country-style inn. 
</P>
<P>
Our mission was not easy, but has been accomplished through diligent patience 
and perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
For this and many other reasons, I found it not only distressing, but 
infuriating, to see John Glionna's recent article, "On Road to Change" (Dec. 2) 
churning out gems like "riffraff motels reincarnated from some spooky old 
Hitchcock thriller." 
</P>
<P>
We are the new blood in Leucadia, the young investors who came to town not to 
build strip shopping centers but to take existing properties and enhance the 
charm of a seaside community. There are young families investing in real 
estate, investors starting their own businesses, people looking for an 
opportunity to build a life and a community away from the maddening crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the media continually choose to downgrade and destroy the whole population 
of this town based on a few isolated problems, which every community copes 
with. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that you can walk into any shop in town and people are friendly and 
they know your name is something we take for granted. That you know your 
neighbors and can count on them to pick up a shovel and rebuild stairs to the 
beach when the city turns its back on you. 
</P>
<P>
Leucadia is a good city with a spirit and a good future. How about spending 
half as much time bashing the problems and a little more time supporting the 
potential of the last of the great California surfing towns? 
</P>
<P>
We're on our way up, with or without the press knocking us to our knees. 
</P>

TIES THAT BIND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Supervisor John MacDonald made a rather incredible admission at the board 
meeting Dec. 4 when he stated he had previously made a commitment not to site a 
landfill at Merriam Mountain while he was a member of the Oceanside City 
Council in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
This admission calls into question the integrity of the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
Are there other sites that were rejected, not because they were inappropriate, 
but because of undisclosed political commitments previously made? 
</P>
<P>
Shouldn't Supervisor MacDonald now disqualify himself from any discussion of 
the Merriam Mountain sites in the upcoming months? 
</P>
<P>
Has Supervisor MacDonald's previously unknown commitment caused him to continue 
to consider the Aspen Road site rather than look at a potentially more 
appropriate site because of a political deal?

RETHINKING THE FACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Knowing that most Americans are firm believers in the First Amendment guarantee 
of free speech, believe that news reporters report the news while editorialists 
express opinions, I always believe 100% of the facts presented in news 
articles. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, after reading the news article ("The Great Communicator," Nov. 28) 
on the radio talk show interview between KSDO host Michael Reagan and his 
father, former President Ronald Reagan, I will make the following changes in my 
thinking and writing: 
</P>
<P>
If writing an article which necessitates the mention of Mikhail Gorbachev, I 
will be certain to change the spelling to the Americanized "Michael," which the 
L.A. Times used. 
</P>
<P>
When deciding to shop, I will make an effort to figure out whether I will go to 
Sears or Montgomery Ward. The L.A. Times doesn't seem to know the difference. 
</P>
<P>
When I receive my Sunday New York Times, I will remind myself that, although 
I've always believed their best seller list is the authority on book sales, the 
Los Angeles Times must know something I don't. The New York Times list placed 
former President Reagan's book, "An American Life," in eighth place on the 
nonfiction list as of Nov. 25. But the Los Angeles Times' story states that the 
book is selling dismally. 
</P>
<P>
Oh well, I've been wrong a couple of times before.

WANTS 'CRIME SECTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In my 43 years as a professional bail bondsman, and after thoroughly studying 
and analyzing the overall picture of crime and punishment, I have come up with 
the following observations: 
</P>
<P>
Start publishing the names, addresses, occupations and charges of all the 
prostitutes, johns, drunk drivers and all persons arrested or detained in a 
24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
Make a "crime section" in your paper similar to your sports financial and 
society sections. Crime is the most important activity in the minds of the 
public, according to all the public polls that are taken. 
</P>
<P>
Try it. The public will love it and the law breakers will hate it.

By Terry Rather, Times Staff Writer: Tom Demere loves uncovering mysteries from 
the past as a paleontologist for the San Diego Natural History Museum. The 
42-year-old Demere studies animal and plant fossils and has participated with 
fellow museum paleontologists in several excavations throughout the county, 
including a dig that uncovered the remains of a dinosaur in Carlsbad. A few 
months ago, the paleontologists discovered a 3-million-year-old toothed whale 
fossil in Chula Vista. Demere graduated from San Diego State, earned a master's 
degree in geology from the University of Southern California, and is working on 
a doctorate at UCLA. He spoke with Times Staff Writer Terry Rather and was 
photographed by Bruce K. Huff. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I guess you could say paleontology was something I came across in my 
undergraduate studies at SDSU. While searching for something I was interested 
in doing, I took classes where I studied the Earth and ecosystems. This led me 
to paleontology, which is a bridge between geology and biology. 
</P>
<P>
I have colleagues who grew up collecting shells and loving dinosaurs. As a kid, 
I spent a lot of time looking at natural settings. I was amazed by the changes 
in seasons and how flood waters can carry off sediment, rocks, houses, and so 
on. In my teens and early 20s, I did a lot of surfing, and that introduced me 
to the ocean and the dynamic nature of beach. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most dramatic setting is out in the desert; to be about 1,500 feet 
above sea level and look at remains that were deposited 7 million years ago of 
ancient sea creatures -- like clams, snails, sea urchins, whales and sharks -- 
and see how really dramatic the changes that have gone on are. I've been a 
paleontologist for 16 years and with the museum for 11 years. Prior to coming 
to the museum, I didn't participate in excavations, but since coming, we have 
done lots of excavations, all local and in Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone's vision of a paleontologist is that we're digging up dinosaurs. I've 
participated in plenty of excavations and found only one dinosaur, but it was 
exciting because it was a new kind of dinosaur for this area. About seven years 
ago we excavated a bone bed, which is a geologic layer that has a lot of bone 
in it, about a foot thick, in the Mission Hills area. We worked on that for 
about a month and a half, and we found a whole slew of bones of marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
What I enjoy most is the sense of discovery and digging into the past. I think 
every paleontologist has his own "wish list" of organisms he'd like to find. We 
have found bits and pieces of organisms that we'd like to find more of. Finding 
more would enable us to learn more, to unravel the evolution of this animal. 
The top of our wish list is the giant sea cow, which was probably 10 meters 
long. Over the years, we've found parts of this animal. It's always very 
exciting to uncover the remains of an organism no one has seen before and the 
fact that you can read about the past from the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
And the fossils, whether you are looking at ancient communities of herbivores 
or carnivores, bring to life how dynamic life is and how interesting and 
different and similar the processes are. 
</P>
<P>
Competition, life, death, have all been a part of life for hundreds of millions 
of years. The only change has been the players. You're able to look into the 
past and see how it relates to the future. 
</P>
<P>
Through paleontology you are able to time travel. One of the things I've tried 
to do at the museum is bring that sense of amazement to time travel to the 
general public through classes and, until recently, exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement of the kids who come to the museum is great. The youngest I 
remember had been a 3-year-old. He was so nuts on dinosaurs, he would just bowl 
you over on what he knew. He knew all the names and the stories the scientists 
have told about these animals. So to see his amazement at an actual dinosaur 
bone in the museum, when he actually got to hold the evidence of these stories, 
well, that's exciting. It's amazing how bright these kids are and how turned on 
they are to science. 
</P>
<P>
I really enjoy the people I meet and work with. It takes a certain personality 
to like to do tedious things, like crawling around on your hands and knees 
looking for remains of organisms.

UCLA TURNS ON RESERVE POWER TO BEAT DEPAUL; 
</P>

<P>
A year ago, UCLA probably would have lost a game such as the one it played 
Saturday against DePaul. 
</P>
<P>
On the road, trailing by 11 points in the second half and with several players 
in foul trouble, the Bruins probably would have collapsed in the stretch and 
walked away defeated and disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
But these Bruins, a team with more depth, discipline and confidence, rallied to 
beat the Blue Demons, 92-90, on a pair of free throws by junior guard Darrick 
Martin with 4.6 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a more mature team with a lot of character," Coach Jim Harrick said. 
"We grew a lot today. You can't measure what a win like this might do for you 
down the road in February and March." 
</P>
<P>
Even if it does nothing, it had to be gratifying. 
</P>
<P>
In front of a crowd of 10,254 at the Rosemont Horizon, the Bruins withstood a 
40-point effort by DePaul forward David Booth, running their record to 7-0 for 
their best start since the 1974-75 season, when they won their first 12 games 
en route to the last of their 10 NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore forward Tracy Murray led UCLA with a career-high 31 points, but of 
equal importance to the sixth-ranked Bruins was the all-round play of reserve 
guard Shon Tarver and reserve forward Keith Owens. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver and Owens sparked the Bruins as they rallied from a 68-57 deficit to 
outscore DePaul, 35-22, in the last 14 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-6 run by UCLA, which enabled the Bruins to catch the Blue Demons at 74-74 
with nine minutes left, included nine points by Tarver, the ever-blossoming 
freshman from Santa Clara High in Oxnard, and six by Owens, a senior and former 
walk-on who led UCLA with 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Murray and Booth then exchanged baskets for several minutes before Harrick 
switched to a box-and-one defense against Booth and the junior gunner fell 
silent, failing to score in the last six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought 40 (points) was enough," Harrick said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point shot by reserve guard Brad Niemann with 3:27 left and a free 
throw by guard Melvon Foster with 3:09 left gave DePaul an 88-85 lead, but UCLA 
outscored the Blue Demons the rest of the way, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Murray's three-point bomb from the right wing pulled the Bruins even with 1:46 
left. Then, after a pass from forward Stephen Howard sailed through the hands 
of Niemann and out of bounds, Owens made two free throws with 1:03 remaining to 
give UCLA the lead, 90-88. 
</P>
<P>
After a jump shot by DePaul's Terry Davis again tied the score with 52 seconds 
left, UCLA tried to set up a shot by Murray. Howard, though, deflected Murray's 
shot from the left wing and the ball was up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to control it, Owens deflected it toward the top of the key to Martin, 
who quickly put up a shot and was fouled by Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Martin stepped to the line and made two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of watching Tracy's shot, thinking it was going to go in, but it 
got blocked and bounced out," Martin said. "I just went and got it and put it 
up as quickly as possible because I thought there were only about two seconds 
left." 
</P>
<P>
With 4.6 seconds to play, DePaul had time to score. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Demons brought the ball in to Booth, who quickly dribbled it across 
midcourt against Tarver's defense and put up a running, off-balance three-point 
shot that wasn't close, glancing off the bottom of the rim. 
</P>
<P>
"A loss like that is tough to take," said DePaul Coach Joey Meyer, whose team 
was 4-0 and on the verge of moving into the top 25 in the Associated Press poll 
before collapsing in the second half and losing at Louisville Wednesday night, 
94-75. "UCLA's a great team and they rose up to make the big plays, but I have 
no complaints against our team. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever we didn't have Wednesday night, we had today. We played really hard 
against a very talented basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Murray, who made 12 of 21 shots after working in practice last week with 
assistant coach Brad Holland, said: "Every shot I took in warmups was a brick." 
. . . DePaul Coach Joey Meyer, asked if David Booth was as effective against 
previous opponents: "Obviously, if he was, he'd be averaging 40 points. But 
he's had those nights. He has those capabilities. When he gets hot, there isn't 
really anybody who can stop him." Booth, who made 14 of 23 shots, increased his 
average to 22.3 points a game. He took only two shots in the last six minutes, 
missing both. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA hadn't given up more points to an individual since March 14, 1987, when 
Fennis Dembo of Wyoming scored 41 against the Bruins in an NCAA tournament 
game. . . . Meyer, on the Bruins: "They keep coming in with better players." . 
. . Citing the play of Keith Owens, who had eight points, 11 rebounds, three 
assists, a block and a steal, almost all of them during the Bruins' decisive 
run, Meyer said: "He was the difference. I knew he was a pretty good player. I 
didn't know he was that good." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Don MacLean, who needed four stitches to close a cut over his right eye 
that was opened in a second-half collision, scored 18 points, making eight of 
13 shots. It was the first time this season that he was held to less than 20 
points. He needs 20 to move past Sidney Wicks and into 10th place on the 
Bruins' all-time scoring list. 
</P>
<P>
Shon Tarver made six of nine shots and had 13 points, five assists and four 
rebounds in 19 minutes. . . . UCLA overcame 60% free-throw shooting, its worst 
of the season. The Bruins were only 15 of 25 from the line, but they made their 
last six. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is 50-21 in more than two seasons under Coach Jim Harrick, but only 14-13 
on the road, including an 80-67 victory last month over a Division II opponent, 
Alaska Anchorage. . . . UCLA's Rodney Zimmerman and Chris Kenny collided in 
practice last week, with Zimmerman needing seven stitches to close a cut over 
his left eye. Kenny suffered a mild concussion.

BOUNCE STOPS HERE, BUCKS WIN; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPERS: ROBERTS' OFFENSIVE REBOUND OF A MISSED FREE THROW WITH 16 SECONDS 
LEFT IS THE KEY PLAY IN MILWAUKEE'S 98-92 VICTORY.

<P>
The Clippers rebounded Saturday night from their 40-point whipping at Chicago 
the night before, but they didn't rebound when it mattered most. 
</P>
<P>
With 16 seconds to play in a game they trailed by two points, Clipper chances 
took one on the chin when Milwaukee's Fred Roberts grabbed an offensive rebound 
from a missed free throw, was fouled, and made both of his attempts from the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
That finished the comeback for good, a turning point in the Bucks' 98-92 
victory at the Bradley Center. 
</P>
<P>
The grab by Roberts, resulting partially out of the luck because the ball 
bounced out to him, didn't matter so much in points as perspective, because the 
Clippers were shut out after a three-point basket by Ken Norman with two 
minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
"That (Roberts' rebound) was the crucial play in the game," said Loy Vaught, 
who had 13 rebounds for the Clippers, seven on the offensive end, but wasn't in 
the game at the time. "That's the second time we've lost a game because of a 
missed free throw. I blew an assignment once when my man got an offensive 
rebound. I don't remember who it was, and I don't want to. I just know we lost 
at Phoenix (Nov. 16 in overtime) on a similar play. 
</P>
<P>
"It just takes the life out of you when something like that happens. They get 
the ball, but they also get a mental victory, kind of showing who wanted the 
ball more." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers were in good position for the victory and the rebound, but got 
neither, losing to Milwaukee for the eighth time in the last nine tries. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers trailed, 93-89, after Norman's layin with 2:42 left. When he hit 
the three-point basket 42 seconds later, the Bucks' lead was one. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom dropped out from there. The next Clipper possession resulted in a 
24-second violation, and, after Milwaukee again failed to score, the Clippers 
couldn't get a shot on their next trip downcourt. They got free throws, though, 
when Norman took a lob pass underneath from Charles Smith and used a pump fake 
to draw the foul from Jack Sikma. 
</P>
<P>
Norman's first shot was short. The second was long. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks responded with a free throw by Frank Brickowski, then a miss that 
bounced right to Roberts. Fouled almost immediately, he converted two attempts 
for a 96-92 advantage with 13 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
"That put us in a position where they had to score two baskets for sure," 
Roberts said. "When they missed that free throw, they missed a big time 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
When Jay Humphries made two more free throws with seven seconds remaining for 
the final margin, the Clippers were done for good, the victim of a lost 
opportunity and, just as striking, a lost offense. 
</P>
<P>
This was the sixth time in nine games they have failed to reach triple figures 
in scoring, and one other time they landed on 100. Saturday, they were lulled 
into the Bucks' slower pace and managed only eight points the final 3:59, three 
of which came on free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"They did exactly what I asked them to do," Coach Mike Schuler said of his 
team. "I was proud of that, in that they came in here and gave themselves a 
chance to win the game. Everybody wondered how we would respond after (Friday) 
night's game. I didn't wonder. I had no doubt in my mind they would respond in 
a positive way." 
</P>
<P>
But with just too many negatives at the end. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
There is a chance Benoit Benjamin could also miss the final two games of the 
trip because of complications from having four wisdom teeth removed. He got the 
stitches removed Friday, but doctors now say they had to remove a piece of 
Benjamin's left jaw bone because one tooth was impacted so far, which has 
slowed the recovery. Saturday marked the fourth game the Clipper center has 
missed because of the problem. . . . Bo Kimble played 19 minutes and made only 
one of eight shots. 
</P>
<P>
According to the latest timetable, the soonest Ron Harper could return to 
action is late January, which, if that holds, would a little more than one year 
since he tore ligament and cartilage in his right knee. The Clipper guard has a 
Dec. 23 exam scheduled with Dr. John Bergfeld, who performed the reconstructive 
surgery along with Dr. Tony Daly, during which time he may be cleared to return 
to full practices. Harper, who said it will take about two or three weeks to be 
ready to play after getting clearance, currently is held out of scrimmages and 
drills that include full-speed running and cutting. 
</P>
<P>
The 22 points and five blocked shots by Jeff Martin in Friday's loss at Chicago 
were both career highs. . . . Danny Manning escaped Milwaukee unharmed for the 
first time. He tore his knee up here at a rookie, and last season suffered food 
poisoning from the bad ribs the night before. . . . The Bucks are 12-0 at the 
Bradley Center, their best start ever at home. . . . Having played four games 
in five days, the Clippers are off until Tuesday, when they play at 
Philadelphia.

EIGHT IS ENOUGH FOR KINGS; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: GRETZKY HAS FIVE POINTS AGAINST OILERS AS WINLESS STREAK FINALLY COMES 
TO AN END, 8-3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's over. 
</P>
<P>
After three weeks. After four losses and four ties. 
</P>
<P>
After embarrassing defeats and valiant comeback attempts, painful injuries and 
pointless penalties. 
</P>
<P>
After countless pep talks, displays of temper that left clubhouse furniture in 
ruins and one lost stick, the Kings have won a game. 
</P>
<P>
Letting out all the frustration collected over an eight-game winless streak, 
the Kings blasted the Edmonton Oilers, 8-3, Saturday night before a sellout 
Forum crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Wayne Gretzky's five points and a pair of goals each from Steve Duchesne 
and Bob Kudelski, the Kings racked up their highest goal total of the season to 
improve to 17-9-5 and move back within three points of the Smythe 
Division-leading Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sense of relief," Gretzky said of the end of the streak. "I'd be 
lying if I said there wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"But you have to look at the positive. If people had said in the beginning that 
we'd have the fewest losses in the division and be just three points behind 
Calgary with a couple of games in hand at this point, people wouldn't have 
believed it." 
</P>
<P>
And if people had said the Oilers, defending Stanley Cup champions, would 
stumble from the start of this season, and spend some dark days in the Smythe 
Division cellar where they are again stuck after Saturday's loss, few would 
have believed it, either. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton, playing without injured center Mark Messier, dropped to 12-16-2. By 
winning Saturday, the Winnipeg Jets moved a point ahead of the Oilers back into 
fourth place in the Smythe. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers came into this game having allowed only 88 goals, fewest in the 
division, but the Kings were not to be denied this night. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, Coach Tom Webster showed his frustration at the winless streak 
by throwing a stick onto the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, the emotional leader was Luc Robitaille, who was slapped with a 
major penalty for getting into a rare fight. The opponent was Craig Simpson. It 
was a rematch of their last meeting when Robitaille was suspended for four 
games for high-sticking Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille got Simpson in a headlock in one corner Saturday and pummeled him. 
</P>
<P>
When he was asked if the fight was indeed a continuation of his confrontation 
last month with Simpson, Robitaille replied with a smile, "Oh, was that who it 
was?" 
</P>
<P>
Then, he added, "When you're out for four games, you have memories of sitting 
home." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings buried their memories of the previous eight games early Saturday. 
They got on top with a two-goal spurt midway through the first period, Dave 
Taylor getting his eighth goal and Kudelski his 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky got his team-leading 20th goal on a power play to make it 3-0, scoring 
at the 6:57 mark of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:54 of the period, Steve Kasper increased the Kings' edge to 4-0 with his 
fourth goal. 
</P>
<P>
Duchesne scored at 18:03 in a four-on-four situation. 
</P>
<P>
It took the Robitaille-Simpson battle to get the Oilers on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson was given a double minor for roughing. Robitaille was given two minutes 
for instigating and five minutes for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Given a three-minute major penalty to work with this time, the Oilers managed 
only three shots on goal, including Anatoli Semenov's fourth goal. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton's other goals were scored by Steve Smith (his seventh) and Petr Klima 
(his 11th). 
</P>
<P>
Kudelski scored the Kings' sixth goal. It was his second of the night and 11th 
of the season. Robitaille added his 16th goal and Duchesne his ninth and second 
of the night. Duchesne also had two assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings got plenty out of their efforts, scoring the eight goals on 34 shots. 
Fourteen of those came off goalie Bill Ranford. He was replaced by Kari Takko 
for the final period, but the Kings touched him up for the remaining 10 shots 
and three goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been very upbeat," Webster said of the agonizing winless streak. "We 
knew the breaks would eventually have to start going our way." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Kings face a tough week on the road, in Edmonton, Calgary and 
Vancouver, Gretzky is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody goes through a bit of a tailspin," he said. "Hopefully, ours is 
behind us." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers left center Mark Messier home to rest his left knee. Messier 
sprained that knee earlier in the season and missed 10 games. Edmonton won the 
first game after he was injured, then lost nine in a row. Since Messier's 
return, the Oilers are 10-4. But with the knee acting up and only one game this 
weekend, the Oilers decided to give Messier a few additional days of healing 
time. He is expected back in the lineup Tuesday when the Kings play at 
Edmonton. . . . King defenseman Marty McSorley missed his sixth game with a 
bruised rib. McSorley had been scheduled to return Saturday, but experienced 
soreness in practice. . . . Defenseman Bob Halkidis has been recalled from the 
Kings' Phoenix farm team. Halkidis appeared in two games for the Kings last 
week on emergency recall after missing the early part of the season while 
recovering from shoulder surgery.

THIS TIME, AZTECS GET LAST LAUGH; 
</P>
<P>
UC IRVINE: SAN DIEGO STATE, A 13-POINT LOSER TO THE ANTEATERS LAST SEASON, 
SCORES AN 87-73 VICTORY.

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They had heard all about UC Irvine and its full-court press, fast-break offense 
and penchant for three-point shots. They remembered last year's 13-point loss, 
embarrassing because Irvine proceeded to go on a school-record 15-game losing 
streak immediately afterward. 
</P>
<P>
What the San Diego State Aztecs weren't sure about was how their inexperienced 
guards would react to it all, and whether their injury and flu-stricken team 
would be able to keep up with the pace. 
</P>
<P>
But Irvine was the team that needed to worry. The Aztecs led by 15 for much of 
the second half and eased to an 87-73 victory in front of 1,384 in Peterson 
Gym. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first victory over a Division I team this season for San Diego State 
(3-3), which has seen seven players miss practice time since the season started 
because of various injuries or flu. But the Aztecs didn't have much of a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Dow, San Diego's 7-foot-1 center, led the way with 23 points and 14 
rebounds. Arthur Massey had 19 points, nine assists and six steals. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Herdman led Irvine (3-5) with 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
With Dow clogging the middle, Irvine's Ricky Butler managed only 14 points -- 
five below his average -- and six rebounds -- two below his average. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State shot 52.9% from the field. Irvine shot 47%. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs led, 50-39, at the half, but Irvine cut that to 56-53 with 15:26 
remaining. James Lewis entered the game at that point, and he and Massey led 
the way as San Diego State went on a 12-0 run. The Anteaters never got their 
deficit below double digits again. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point came after an exchange of centers with 8:09 remaining before 
halftime and San Diego State ahead, 27-26. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Dow, who had been given a three-minute rest, re-entered the game 
for Neal Steinly. Meanwhile, Irvine's Butler left after he picked up his second 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs went on a 10-4 run and led, 37-30, with 5:12 left. During that time, 
Dow scored seven of San Diego's 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Dow had 15 points and eight rebounds at halftime, and despite Butler's return, 
Irvine couldn't catch up.

TITANS GET THEIR POINTS ACROSS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MISSISSIPPI VALLEY STATE STAR FORD SCORES 39, BUT CAL STATE 
FULLERTON PICKS UP THE 109-100 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mississippi Valley State guard Alphonso Ford got his points Saturday night, but 
Cal State Fullerton got a victory, defeating the Delta Devils, 109-100, before 
1,715 in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Coach John Sneed said earlier this week that his team would make 
Ford's 40 minutes in Titan Gym "miserable," and he guaranteed Ford would not 
score his average, which was 34.1. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed was partially correct. The Titans made life miserable for Ford, throwing 
several different defenses at him and making him work hard for most of his 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton forward Bruce Bowen's elbow into Ford's face even knocked Ford out of 
the game for a few minutes in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Ford still finished with a game-high 39 points, but it was Sneed who was 
smiling afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"He got his average, but we got a win," Sneed said. "I didn't say those things 
because I didn't have respect for him. I just wanted to motivate my players. We 
had guys who were hungry to play defense tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans apparently had a big appetite for offense, too. Their point total 
was the most since Fullerton scored 117 against U.S. International University 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Small scored 29 points, making 12 of 17 shots from the field and five 
three-point baskets. When Mississippi Valley State cut Fullerton's lead to 
84-80 midway through the second half, Small made two consecutive three-point 
shots to make it 90-80. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve forward J. D. Green, the former Fairfax High standout who transferred 
from Southern Methodist, had his best game as a Titan, scoring 23 points and 
grabbing 14 rebounds, eight of them offensive. He also made a clutch 
three-point shot after the Delta Devils had pulled to within 79-74. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton center Aaron Wilhite added a career-high 18 points and eight 
rebounds, forward Agee Ward had 17 points and 14 rebounds, and reserve center 
Ron Caldwell had 10 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton outrebounded Mississippi Valley State, 66-40, coming up just short of 
its school-record 68 rebounds in a game. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans led by as many as 15 in the first half, scoring 10 unanswered points 
-- seven by Small -- to go ahead, 44-29, at the 6:36 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Defense set up two Fullerton baskets during the run, with Bowen's blocked shot 
starting a break that resulted in Small's three-point basket and Caldwell's 
block, on a three-on-one Delta Devils break, leading to Small's jumper. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi Valley State came back with its own 10-0 run to pull to within 
47-43 with 4:28 remaining, but Fullerton outscored the Delta Devils, 8-2, the 
final four points scored by Green, to close the half with a 57-47 lead.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse, out to make a good impression after a lackluster performance against 
Canisius on Wednesday, dashed to a 19-6 lead and built a 32-point bulge in the 
second half Saturday night before settling for a 94-79 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out a little lackadaisical against Canisius," said freshman Scott 
McCorkle, who came off the bench to join five other players in double figures 
for No. 3 Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
"In this game, we had a little more intensity. We wanted it a little more 
tonight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always a concern, to get out early," said junior forward Dave Johnson, 
who had 12 points. "Tonight, we just came out with the right mental attitude 
and we just got after them." 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim noticed the difference in his team, which he 
criticized after Wednesday's 92-83 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good game for us coming off that last game," Boeheim said. "We were 
active on defense, we got our hands on a lot of loose balls and moved the ball 
offensively." 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse (9-0), which built a 55-35 halftime lead, left no doubt about the 
outcome as it held the 49ers to 14 points in the first 11 1/2 minutes of the 
second half while pushing its lead to 81-49. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (2-5), led by Lucious Harris' 24 points, made the final score closer 
with a 22-6 run against reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Owens finished with 19 points for Syracuse, even though he did not play 
in the final 9 1/2 minutes. Center LeRon Ellis had 17 and McCorkle a 
career-high 14 points coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse, which outscored its opponents by 99 points in the opening half of its 
first eight games, used an aggressive all-court defense to force the 49ers into 
19 turnovers in the first 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen led, 9-6, before scoring off 10 consecutive points, and Johnson's 
breakaway reverse slam with 12:40 left gave Syracuse a 25-11 cushion. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse scored 13 of the next 16 points for a 34-14 lead midway through the 
half, but the 49ers went on a 9-1 run to shave the deficit to 35-23 with 7:31 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse got only one point from three one-and-one free-throw situations during 
a nearly four-minute cold spell from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Joseph's free throw with 4:47 to play made it 42-30, but the Orangemen 
closed the half with a 13-5 burst for a 55-35 lead.

Pepperdine, which led by 12 points in the first half and by six with 8:58 to 
play, went scoreless the final 3:12 in losing to Boise State, 66-56, Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Boise State led, 57-56, when the Waves went cold. The Broncos then made eight 
of eight free throws to pull away. They made 25 of 32 foul shots in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine led, 52-46, when two three-point baskets by Boise State tied the 
score, 52-52, with 7:45 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said: "Boise State's pressure defense during the 
last eight minutes was the key to the game and helped get their crowd into the 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased with how we handled the pressure. We were only down by two with 
1:40 left and gave them a good battle. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a good learning experience for our young team." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore center Tanoka Beard scored 22 points and senior guard Jeff Sanor 
added 18 for the Broncos (5-1) of the Big Sky Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine (5-3) led, 28-16, with 3:35 left in the first half, but Boise State 
outscored the Waves, 15-5, to pull within 33-31 by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Despite foul troubles by Geoff Lear and Doug Christie, the Waves managed to 
take six-point leads on six occasions in the second half. But the Broncos went 
on a 14-2 run, taking the lead for good at 55-54 with a three-pointer by 
Michael Trotter with 6:39 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Christie, a junior guard, led the Waves with 17 points, including 11 in first 
half. Reserve forward Steve Guild, a sophomore, added 12. Lear, the Waves' 
second-leading scorer with a 16.4-point average coming into the game, had 10, 
including only two in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Things won't get any easier for the Waves, who play unbeaten UCLA Wednesday 
night at Pauley Pavilion.

Nevada, 36-13, Saturday at Statesboro, Ga., for their fourth NCAA Division I-AA 
championship in six years. 
</P>
<P>
Gross scored on an eight-yard run in the second quarter and Darryl Hopkins had

Georgia Southern's other touchdowns came on a 14-yard run by Joe Ross early in 
the game and a 15-yard interception return by Alex Mash 44 seconds from the 
end.

Freshman Chris Boniol kicked a 29-yard field goal as time ran out Saturday 
night to give Louisiana Tech a 34-34 tie with Maryland in the Independence 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenza Baker, whose nine tackles helped him win defensive player of the game 
honors, set up the game-ending kick by returning a short kickoff 41 yards to 
the Maryland 40. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs (9-3) moved to the 11 with four seconds left, then decided to go 
for a tie rather than make a last bid for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland (6-5-1) took a 34-31 lead with 52 seconds left on Scott Zolak's 
15-yard, fourth-down touchdown pass to Barry Johnson. Zolak, who completed 18 
of 28 passes for 214 yards, was sacked on the previous play by Baker. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana Tech went ahead, 21-14, on Michael Richardson's one-yard scoring run 
with 10:35 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, offensive player of the game, scored two touchdowns and rushed for 
81 yards in 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland went 80 yards in seven plays to get within 21-20, with Troy Jackson 
going the last 11 yards for his third touchdown, tying an Independence Bowl 
record. Dan DeArmas, who made 47 consecutive extra points, missed the kick wide 
left in what proved to be the difference of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Johnson threw seven yards to Bobby Slaughter with 5:52 left in the third 
quarter to increase Louisiana Tech's lead to 28-20. The score came four plays 
after Eddie Brown's 63-yard kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
Tech overcame a 14-0 deficit to tie the game, 14-14, on James Davis' three-yard 
scoring run with 17 seconds left in the half.

RED-HOT RED WINGS BEAT FLYERS, 3-1

<P>
For many seasons the Norris Division was the doormat of the National Hockey 
League. The division winner was often a .500 team and it seldom made a mark in 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The division improved a bit last season when the Chicago Blackhawks carried the 
eventual Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers to six games in the playoff 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
The league started to take notice of the division this season when Chicago and 
St. Louis jumped off to fast starts. The Blackhawks have the best record in the 
league and the Blues have established themselves a contender. 
</P>
<P>
A third Norris Division team, the Detroit Red Wings, wants to be counted among 
the elite. The Red Wings, last in the division last season, are being led by a 
talented rookie from the Soviet Union, Sergei Fedorov. 
</P>
<P>
Fedorov, who turned 21 Thursday, scored a goal and assisted on the other two 
Saturday at Philadelphia to lead the Red Wings past the Flyers, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-1 center leads all rookies in goals with 14 and points with 34. 
</P>
<P>
Their seventh win in the past 11 games improved the Red Wings' record to 
16-13-4. Last season the Red Wings did not win their 16th until their 46th 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Sergei is a great talent," Detroit star Steve Yzerman said. "He can do a lot 
of good things with the puck. 
</P>
<P>
"But another thing that has helped us this season is that we are coming 
together. We have a number of young guys with talent. They have now played 33 
games and it is beginning to show. We should only get better." 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers have won only once in the last seven games, where they have produced 
only 15 goals. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 1, New Jersey 1 -- The Bruins didn't seem to have their hearts in this 
game at Boston after losing Coach Mike Milbury and wing Lyndon Byers. 
</P>
<P>
Both were given automatic suspensions after coming out on the ice in Friday 
night's game against Hartford. Milbury will be out five games, Byers 10. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's game was as close as the score indicates. Both teams had 35 shots on 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Lee Norwood's first goal of the season earned the tie for New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 5, Chicago 1 -- The North Stars are the No. 4 team in the Norris 
Division, but for this game at Bloomington, Minn., they ignored the Blackhawks' 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Ulf Dahlen, who has started slowly after coming over from the New York Rangers 
in the trade that sent popular Mike Gartner away, scored twice to lead the 
North Stars. 
</P>
<P>
The goals gave Dahlen four in 22 games. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 3, Washington 2 -- The Whalers, happy to get away from the Bruins, 
converted Capital mistakes into a victory at Landover, Md. The Whalers were 
trounced twice in a row by Boston. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 7, Quebec 2 -- Pat LaFontaine had two goals and two assists 
at Uniondale, N.Y., to lead the Islanders to a rare romp. Brent Sutter also had 
two goals for the Islanders, who dominated the battle between the two cellar 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 4, Montreal 2 -- Phil Housley, one of the outstanding offensive 
defensemen, led the Jets to the victory at Winnipeg. Housley scored his ninth 
goal in the first period, then set up two in the third period to bring the Jets 
from behind. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Toronto 2 -- Brett Hull scored his 31st goal shortly after the 
third period faceoff at St. Louis to trigger a Blues uprising. The Blues were 
trailing, 2-1, when Hull scored. The Blues scored twice more in the next eight 
minutes and moved to within four points of first place in the Norris Division.

SOCKERS DOUSE COMETS TO WIN FOURTH IN A ROW

<P>
The Sockers are ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Notorious for their slow starts, the Sockers not only held off the Kansas City 
Comets, 6-5, on Saturday night, but they won their fourth straight game and 
moved to the .500 mark for the first time all season. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, we start off five games under 500, and we get to 500," goalkeeper 
Victor Nogueira said. "Last year, it took us until the playoffs to get to .500. 
This year, we did it pretty fast." 
</P>
<P>
The victory lifted the defending MSL champions to 9-9 and moved them into third 
place in the Western Division, a half-game ahead of Dallas (8-9). 
</P>
<P>
'We're celebrating as if we had won a championship because we got to .500," 
said Socker Coach Ron Newman, whose team matched its longest winning streak of 
a year ago. "We took some tough losses in overtimes early in the season, and 
we've had to regroup and battle back. It's just beginning to come back for us." 
</P>
<P>
The victory came easier than the score indicated. Catching a porous Kansas City 
defense napping, Paul Wright, Jim Gabarra and Paul Dougherty scored 
fourth-quarter goals in a span of 3 minutes 57 seconds, turning a 3-3 tie into 
a 6-3 lead with 6:12 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City (10-7) then lifted goalkeeper Mike Dowler for a sixth attacker, and 
Jan Goossens and Paul Peschisolido each scored their second goals of the game, 
drawing the Comets to within a goal. 
</P>
<P>
But the Comets, who overcame a five-goal deficit on Friday night only to lose 
7-6 in overtime to Baltimore, saw their last hope squelched when Nogueira made 
a sliding save on Peschisolido with 1:00 left. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't come back that many goals, are you kidding? They did it last 
night, no way they'd do it two nights in a row," Nogueira said of Kansas City, 
which lost its third in a row -- all at Kemper Arena, where they lost three 
games all of last season. 
</P>
<P>
"They caught us in a really hot streak right now, and they're a little bit 
down, but they were doing that to teams earlier in the season." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Comets, who got off to a 9-1 start, have lost six of their last 
seven, and they have allowed 55 goals in those seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Six players scored for the Sockers. Waad Hirmez and Brian Quinn had goals in 
the first half, which ended 2-2, and Branko Segota gave them a 3-2 lead 1:18 
into the third quarter with a second-effort goal. 
</P>
<P>
After taking a centering pass from Quinn, Segota's initial shot was saved by 
Dowler, but Segota headed in the rebound for his second goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Segota, who was playing in his third game since missing 13 games because of a 
cracked fibula, had scored his first of the season Friday night at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Goossens tied the score at 4:18 as he rebounded a shot by Ted Eck that had been 
swatted away by Nogueira. 
</P>
<P>
The tie was short-lived. Thirty-three seconds later, the Sockers beat the 
Comets' defense downfield. Quinn sent a ball to Alex Golovnia, and he fed 
Wright, who had a tap-in for his 13th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Gabarra, on a feed from Ben Collins, and Dougherty, pouncing on a ball Dowler 
fumbled coming off the boards, scored 15 seconds apart for the 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball fell perfectly for me," Dougherty said of his team-leading 18th goal. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also improved the Sockers' road record to .500 on the road -- 5-5 
-- compared to last season's 6-20 performance. And the Sockers snapped a 
four-game losing streak in Kansas CIty, where they had not won since April 15, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of hoping to win games, we're expecting to win them," Quinn said. 
"We've set ourselves for the rest of the season. Subconsciously, we're thinking 
it would be nice to win the division. Yeah, we've won championships, but we 
haven't won a division for a while, so we'd like to take first things first." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers, who are in the midst of five consecutive road games, will play at 
Cleveland next Friday and at Baltimore on Jan. 22. The Sockers' next home game 
is Jan. 4 against Tacoma. . . . Sockers owner Ron Fowler and president Ron Cady 
made the trip to St. Louis and Kansas City. . . . The Comets and Sockers will 
meet again Jan. 6 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
* DEAL IN THE WORKS?: The Sockers and Cleveland are discussing a possible trade 
that would send midfielder Mike Sweeney to San Diego.

<P>
The San Diego Gulls had 45 shots on goal, but converted only four times as they 
fell to the Kalamazoo Wings, 6-4, Saturday night in front of 3,440. 
</P>
<P>
The shot total was the second most by the Gulls (15-13-3) this year, but Wing 
goaltender Larry Dyck stopped 41. 
</P>
<P>
The Wings (24-6) fired 32 shots at goalie Alain Chevrier, who was playing in 
his first game back in the International Hockey League since being demoted from 
the Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
Kalamazoo jumped out to a 3-0 lead after one period on goals by Ed Courtnay, 
Garry Emmons and Pater Lappin. 
</P>
<P>
The Wings' Steve Gottas scored two minutes into the second, before the Gulls 
got goals from Darren Lowe and Clark Donatelli to make it 4-2 after two 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
After the Wings made it 6-2, the Gulls' Dennis Holland scored his 11th and 
Steve Dykstra got his third on an assist from newly-acquired center Ron Duguay 
got his first point as a goal. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego defenseman Derek Mayer's 14 game-point scoring streak was snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Gull Coach Mike O'Connell was pleased with his team's effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We played well and we worked very hard, and if we work like that all the time 
we'll win a lot of hockey games," O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference was, we made a lot of mistakes in our end."

<P>
They do things differently at Oklahoma. The team's radio announcer wears a 
tuxedo, complete with red bow tie. The shooting guard sings the national 
anthem. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing never changes: The Sooners don't lose in Norman, and Loyola 
Marymount did little to challenge that record Saturday in a 172-112 blowout in 
front of a crowd of 10,910. 
</P>
<P>
For the 13th-ranked Sooners (8-1) it was the 51st consecutive victory in Lloyd 
Noble Center, and their 75th in a row against nonconference opponents. Nobody 
outside the Big Eight has beaten the Sooners at home since Tulsa in December 
1982. And the victory raised Oklahoma Coach Billy Tubbs' record to 98-0 in 
100-point games. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooner assault was led by their newest hired gun, junior guard Brent Price, 
who was freed from point guard duties Saturday and also wasn't asked to sing 
"The Star Spangled Banner," which he has done on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
He did everything else: The younger brother of NBA star Mark Price had 11 
three-point baskets on the way to 56 points, joining Wayman Tisdale as the only 
Sooners to top 50. It was also a record performance for the Noble Center. He 
made 20 of 33 shots, 19 from three-point range, and added nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma's point total was the highest ever against Loyola by a bunch, 
eclipsing the 152 scored by Northeastern three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 94, Cal State Long Beach 79 -- Host Syracuse, out to make a good 
impression after a lackluster performance against Canisius on Wednesday, dashed 
to a 19-6 lead and built a 32-point bulge in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 Syracuse (9-0), which built a 55-35 halftime lead, left no doubt about 
the outcome as it held the 49ers to 14 points in the first 11 1/2 minutes of 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Boise State 66, Pepperdine 56 -- Pepperdine, which led by 12 points in the 
first half and by six with 8:58 to play, went scoreless the final 3:12 in 
losing at Boise, Idaho. Boise State led, 57-56, when the Waves went cold. The 
Broncos then made eight of eight free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton 109, Mississippi Valley 100 -- Mississippi Valley State 
guard Alphonso Ford got his points Saturday night, but host Cal State Fullerton 
got the victory. Ford finished with 39 points, above his 34.1 average. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Joe Small scored 29 points, making 12 of 17 shots from the field 
and five three-point baskets. When Mississippi Valley State cut Fullerton's 
lead to 84-80 midway through the second half, Small made two consecutive 
three-point shots to make it 90-80. ALAN DROOZ

GEARY GETS THE BEST OF FORMER MATES IN MATER DEI'S VICTORY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mater Dei High School guard Reggie Geary celebrated a homecoming Saturday night 
in the third-place game of the Tournament of Champions at Ocean View High. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Geary was the leading scorer for Ocean View's junior varsity 
basketball team as a freshman before transferring to Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, he scored 30 points against his former teammates and the 
Monarchs rolled to a 79-58 victory over Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino won the tournament title with a 65-52 victory over Long Beach 
Poly. Roy Owes, a senior center, led San Bernardino (9-0) with 37 points. He 
had 26 of his team's 37 points in the second half. Long Beach Poly is 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (5-3) opened an 18-4 lead in the first quarter as Ocean View failed 
to make a field goal in 10 attempts. Geary made 11 of 20 shots and eight of 11 
free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"That was easily my best game," Geary said. "I've worked hard on my shooting 
ability. I played with a lot of the guys at Ocean View, so yeah, I was psyched 
up tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei pounded Ocean View (5-3) inside with its power game and for the 
second straight night showed glimpses of past Mater Dei teams. Afterward, Mater 
Dei Coach Gary McKnight said he was encouraged with his team's progress. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come a long ways from last Saturday when we lost to Los Alamitos," 
McKnight said. "I'm happy to come here and get three wins. I hope this is the 
start of something big." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei struggled last week in the Trabuco Hills tournament, losing to J.W. 
North and Los Alamitos. Geary gave three reasons for the Monarchs' poor start. 
</P>
<P>
"Inexperience, no drive and not knowing what it takes to win," he said. "We're 
starting to come around. I think everyone now knows what it takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View, which plays Mater Dei again Wednesday at Chapman College, is 
heading in the opposite direction. The Seahawks have averaged only 47.5 points 
in losses to San Bernardino and Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played extremely poorly," Ocean View Coach Jim Harris said. "I don't 
plan any personnel changes, but we've got to make some changes in the way we're 
playing. We're not reacting well or shooting well." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 60, Long Beach Millikan 50 -- Guard Gentry Moore stole a pass and scored 
on a layup with 3:24 remaining to break open a close game and Tustin (7-1) went 
on to win the fifth-place game. 
</P>
<P>
Center Brian Reider made a jump shot and two free throws in the final 1:32. The 
Tillers outscored Millikan, 21-12, in the last quarter. Guard David Beilstein, 
who missed two games because of the flu, led all scorers with 26 points. 
Millikan fell to 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Servite 49, San Marcos 47 -- Forward Ryan Dodd made a jump shot with one second 
remaining to give Servite (7-1) the consolation championship. San Marcos (5-2) 
had tied the score, 47-47, when center Rob Ramaker made a 15-foot shot with 23 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola 85, Loara 83 -- Tes Whitlock scored 38 points and finished with 117 in 
three games. With one second remaining and the score tied, 83-83, Whitlock had 
an opportunity to put Loara ahead, but the senior guard was called for a 
technical at the foul line.

THE REDGRAVE SISTERS: A THEORY OF RELATIVITY

</HEADLINE>

<P>
By RICK DU BROW, Rick Du Brow writes about television for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is 10 p.m. in a big, wonderfully atmospheric old house in the Hancock Park 
section of Los Angeles. And on this particular night, filming has just been 
completed on a project that is bound to raise eyebrows: an ABC remake for 
television of the Bette Davis-Joan Crawford Gothic horror classic, "What Ever 
Happened to Baby Jane?" 
</P>
<P>
On the spacious grounds behind the house, a wrap party has begun. But inside, 
in a large, paneled den, the two stars whose performances are certain to invite 
comparison with Crawford and Davis are seated side by side on a couch, elated 
by their experience of finally working together in a major project. 
</P>
<P>
They are sisters: Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave. 
</P>
<P>
Their lives and careers have taken them in different directions, even 
geographically. Vanessa, 53, lives in England; Lynn, 47, in Los Angeles. Yet as 
they chat warmly and study each other's reactions during a one-hour interview, 
often laughing with the intimacy reserved for family, it is clear that the 
unlikely vehicle of a spooky cult film has had special meaning for both of 
them, personally as well as professionally. 
</P>
<P>
By a quirk, "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?," which ABC plans to run during 
the February ratings sweeps, was just the first of two projects for the 
Redgrave sisters that came almost simultaneously -- after their lifetime apart 
in show business. Shortly after completing the TV film, both left for England, 
where they opened on the London stage in Chekhov's "The Three Sisters" last 
week, along with another member of the Redgrave theatrical dynasty, their niece 
Jemma. 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa says it was "sheer coincidence" that the two projects "happened about 
the same time," and then explains the origins of how she and Lynn finally got 
together: 
</P>
<P>
"We were in New York and we both appeared in a concert that I produced called 
'The Wall Breaks.' It was a celebration of the overthrow of the Stalinist 
regimes, and there were a lot of marvelous artists taking part. And I rang Lynn 
and said, would she take part? And what would she think if we did the last 
scene from 'The Three Sisters'? 
</P>
<P>
"So she thought about it and said, 'Well, maybe it's the only time we'll ever 
work together, so yes, let's.' And our brother (Corin, also an actor -- and the 
father of Jemma) did it. And Chris Reeve did it, and Sigourney Weaver played 
Irina (one of the sisters) with us. 
</P>
<P>
"And many people said it was extraordinary. And we knew it was. It was a very 
special evening. And it was a very special moment that we were there in this 
scene playing real sisters. And it was just about that time that we had word 
from (executive producers) Bill Aldrich and Steve White about 'What Ever 
Happened to Baby Jane?' " 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich's late father, Robert Aldrich, had produced and directed the original 
1962 movie, in which the feuding between Davis and Crawford became part of 
Hollywood lore. Yet it was also a film that rescued the careers of the two 
acting legends -- and Bill Aldrich, then a teen-ager, was an assistant to his 
father on the production. In recent years, he had tried mightily to put 
together a new version of "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?,' first in vain as 
a motion picture, then, finally, as a TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
The story is about sisters -- two aging actresses living in hate in a faded 
mansion in Hancock Park. Crawford played Blanche, the once-glamorous star now 
confined to a wheelchair because of an accident that Davis, formerly the child 
performer Baby Jane, thinks she caused. Blanche seems the victim, while Davis 
has become a boozing terror. 
</P>
<P>
In ABC's version, set in the present, Vanessa Redgrave is the confined Blanche, 
and Lynn portrays the grotesque Baby Jane. "I think people expected Vanessa to 
play Baby Jane," Aldrich said earlier in an interview while waiting for the 
production to wrap. "And that's why I wanted Lynn to play her." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that was absolutely perfect," says Vanessa. "I knew Lynn would be 
quite extraordinary in this part. There wasn't a question in my mind as to who 
should be who as soon as the idea came up." 
</P>
<P>
"Here were all those years and years when Vanessa and I hadn't worked 
together," says Lynn. "When we talked, we mentioned that fact. She never stops 
working. I never stop working. This was the first time we've had many 
consecutive days together probably since we were children in our parents' 
house. It's very hard to find a project, 
</P>
<P>
and then suddenly we found two in a row. With 'Baby Jane,' it was really Bill 
Aldrich found us." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich says he's "frightened" about the reception to his new production, which 
David Greene directed and Brian Taggert wrote -- because the memory of the old 
one is still vivid. "I'm frightened about it because my father made it," he 
says. But what makes him "comfortable," he adds, is the performances of the 
Redgraves, even though "people were saying, is it gimmicky having sisters play 
sisters?" 
</P>
<P>
For both the Redgraves and Aldrich, the casting of real sisters in the roles 
added a rare quality to the production of ABC's "Baby Jane." 
</P>
<P>
"There are things that Lynn and Vanessa do and say -- and looks that they give 
one another -- that only sisters could give, only sisters who've known each 
other for over 47 years, and have shared terrible tragedies and wonderful highs 
together," says Aldrich. "At the end of some takes, they would stare at each 
other and then hug each other and cry. Actors don't do that. Sisters do that." 
</P>
<P>
Informed of Aldrich's assessment, Vanessa nods her head in agreement. Lynn 
adds: "I think we did feel that. We had a childhood where my relationship with 
Vanessa was unique in that we never fought. Vanessa was a sort of storybook 
sister to me. There is a bond between us that I feel very, very strongly." 
</P>
<P>
"So do I," Vanessa says softly, staring at Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
The two women sometimes seem planets apart in manner, although they are sitting 
inches from each other. Vanessa considers each question thoughtfully before 
answering, then chooses her words carefully, sometimes staring at the floor as 
though concentrating to get every nuance across. Lynn's answers burst forth in 
a rush of exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Vanessa gets up to help a reporter shut the door tight after a 
stream of people pass through and break the flow of the interview. 
</P>
<P>
Although both sisters have played the classics, Vanessa's formidable image 
remains that of a grand-style actress, while Lynn -- who has also been splendid 
in such films as "Georgy Girl" -- seems more outgoing and is not above plunging 
into such television series as "House Calls" and "Chicken Soup," or doing 
commercials for Weight Watchers. 
</P>
<P>
When it is suggested to Vanessa that it's difficult to imagine her doing a 
television series, she laughs and replies: 
</P>
<P>
"What a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Really? Could she see herself doing a weekly series? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes. I certainly could." 
</P>
<P>
What kind? 
</P>
<P>
"Just a good kind. I've never done one. I would like to do one. And I probably 
wonder if I could do it." 
</P>
<P>
Would she consider one in the United States? 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly I would, if I was offered one." 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, her American TV roles have principally been in strong dramatic 
specials. 
</P>
<P>
They include "Playing for Time," a Holocaust concentration camp drama for which 
she won an Emmy; "Second Serve," in which she portrayed the transsexual doctor 
and tennis player, Renee Richards; "Orpheus Descending," the recently revived 
Tennessee Williams play, presented by Ted Turner's TNT cable station following 
its Broadway run; and "My Body, My Child," an "ABC Theatre" production about a 
woman who must decide whether to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these heavyweight dramas and such memorable films as "Isadora" and 
"Julia," for which she won an Oscar, Vanessa says that if she took the TV 
series plunge -- in America or "elsewhere" -- she'd be open to comedy as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she says. "People tend to put actresses and actors in categories, 
naturally, because they'll have seen them in something they liked. But the 
issue isn't the format -- it's the story." 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa Redgrave is, of course, not only perhaps the finest actress in the 
English-speaking world, but also has been a controversial public figure because 
of her outspoken support of leftist politics and the Palestinian cause. She 
does not like to be interviewed about such matters but, asked whether she 
thought her Broadway reception in "Orpheus Descending" was important in opening 
some doors that may have been closed to her for a while in America, she ponders 
the question and replies: 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I can address it in one aspect, which I think is the most important -- 
which is that times change. What people are concerned with changes. Mostly, 
what we all share is that we want to know more than we knew before. I think 
we're living in times when, in the main, we all think that people have got a 
right to their own point of view. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to hear these points of view. We don't want anybody's point of view 
not to be heard, whether we agree with it or not. I stress that because, while 
not wanting to get into political subjects, it is so bound up with the content 
of the work that a writer is writing about, and how a producer and writer think 
it should be communicated, and who they cast in it. 
</P>
<P>
"And we're living in a very international world in which a hundred variants 
that have divided us from each other are breaking down one after another." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate conversation later in the night, following the joint interview 
with her sister, Lynn Redgrave adds her strong feelings on the matter: 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of horrifying that she was blocked from work for a long time, 
where her work, it seemed to me, spoke for itself. Her political beliefs are 
poles apart in many cases from things that I believe, though sometimes we cross 
paths. But I think the longer (things) went on, it was a sort of 
self-fulfilling prophecy. And when, thank goodness, the producers of 'Orpheus' 
said, 'We're going to put it on because of her wonderful performance in 
England,' nobody stormed the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly violence had been perpetrated in the past. But nobody did anything 
except say it's a great performance. It broke the spell, and thank God it did. 
I don't want to comment on her political beliefs. That's not my thing to do. 
But she's held true to what she believes in. If it's not what somebody else 
believes in, it's still a free country supposedly, but unfortunately it was 
proved not to be. 
</P>
<P>
"And now it would appear that for the good fortune of audiences everywhere, 
they're going to see her again. And I think that's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
"I was the child of whom nothing was expected," says Lynn Redgrave. 
</P>
<P>
She and Vanessa were both born in London to the late performer Sir Michael 
Redgrave and his wife, Rachel Kempson, who is still acting. 
</P>
<P>
"Vanessa," Lynn continues, "was the child of the family -- being the oldest -- 
of whom everything was expected. And she surpassed any possible expectations. 
My aspirations were treated with amazement and sort of suppressed shock because 
basically our parents were very nice people who didn't want to show their 
shock." 
</P>
<P>
"You picked it up," says Vanessa with quiet amusement. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw it," says Lynn. "I saw the shock. And indeed, when we finally read our 
father's autobiography, 'In My Mind's Eye,' which came out maybe two years 
before his death, I discovered for the first time -- since he was the great 
communicator on stage but not to me -- the absolute depth of his shock when I 
announced that I was going to be an actress. I had no idea of it because his 
stock in trade, to me certainly, was to greet things with a noncommittal sort 
of look. His great communication was in his work." 
</P>
<P>
Looking at Vanessa, who continues laughing softly, Lynn recalls the special 
standing of her sister in the family, "including the very lavish announcement 
from the stage of 'Hamlet' by Laurence Olivier on the moment of her birth." 
</P>
<P>
But though her own lot was "the exact opposite" and the two sisters went their 
"totally different ways," Lynn adds: "Out of that we made our own lives and our 
own careers and had our children. And as unbelievable as it may seem, a 
rivalry, a hatred, a moment of wanting to kill the other one -- all of which 
are natural to most sisters -- never happened. We're people of an advanced age 
now. It's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
It would, of course, make for juicy viewing if the two sisters starring in 
"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" were at odds, as their characters are -- and 
as Bette Davis and Joan Crawford were. In 1967, for instance, the Redgrave 
sisters were competing nominees for the Oscar for best actress -- Vanessa for 
"Morgan" and Lynn for "Georgy Girl." (The winner was Elizabeth Taylor for 
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?") 
</P>
<P>
"The press was upon us," says Lynn, "desperately looking for antagonism because 
it was so much more interesting if we hated each other. I was just amazed. We 
weren't that way." 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the same way," says Vanessa. "I saw 'Georgy Girl' at the time we were 
both up for an Oscar. And I saw it again, I suppose about two years ago. I was 
absolutely astounded by Lynn's work (as a plump ugly duckling in the comedy). 
When I see Lynn act, I feel some of the same, I guess, as when I saw our 
father, Michael, act. There are times you just don't think you know the person 
because they're so surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in a way we've been lucky. I wouldn't have chosen it to be this way -- 
I would have preferred that we'd had more time together. But I think that 
sometimes families take each other for granted a hell of a lot. Because they 
see each other so frequently, through all the little ins and outs of life, they 
lose a perspective. They think, my sister, my father, my son, my daughter. And 
they don't see this extraordinary human being out there. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps because we're in the profession that we are, you do see something of 
that extraordinary human being in the work they do, and you're astonished." 
</P>
<P>
But of course there is the flip side to show business, as epitomized by the 
extreme example of the twisted sisters in "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" 
Lynn Redgrave thinks that growing up in a theatrical family -- even one far 
removed from the world of Blanche and Jane -- brought something extra to the 
production and provided food for thought about the nature of the "cut-throat 
business." 
</P>
<P>
"Although we weren't child actors, it's something we know pretty well," she 
says. "Yes, our knowledge of the theater from an early age probably helped. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very curious thing to do for a living. And the reason it is so strange 
and corrupting, I think, is that all your life as a child, you are encouraged 
to overcome your emotions. You must stop being childlike. You must grow up. You 
know, behave like a big girl and grow up. Then you grow up -- and if you become 
an actress, what you must recall or hang on to is all of your most primitive 
instincts that you've been taught to overcome and suppress." 
</P>
<P>
Did the Redgraves' distinguished parents bar them from becoming child actors? 
</P>
<P>
"Well," says Lynn, "I didn't want to act at the start, until I was stage-struck 
at the age of 15 1/2. Vanessa was acting before me and playing as a dancer and 
everything. I think you did want to be a child actor, didn't you?" 
</P>
<P>
"If they had let me, I would have," says Vanessa. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn: "You were always just desperate to be an actress, and they didn't think 
(being a child actor) was a good idea at all." 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa: "No." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn: "I recall our parents both saying that it was very detrimental to the 
adult actor process. If you want to be an adult actor, the one thing that isn't 
going to help you is to be a child actor. Being a child actor is a whole other 
process. As our friend Roddy McDowall said the other night, if you want to 
become an adult actor, you have to start all over again, and it's bloody 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
To some, it is also bloody difficult to think of anyone but Bette Davis and 
Joan Crawford in "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" Could anyone take the place 
of Gloria Swanson in "Sunset Boulevard" -- that other nightmare of the 
Hollywood dream? 
</P>
<P>
Producer Steve White says "a lot of people were afraid of the original, of the 
risk" when he unsuccessfully tried to mount a motion picture remake of "What 
Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" while running the features division at New World 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The original film earned five Academy Award nominations, including one for 
Davis, who was certain she would get the statuette for best actress. Instead, 
she stood stunned in the wings when Anne Bancroft was announced as the winner 
for "The Miracle Worker." And Crawford sailed onstage to accept for the absent 
Bancroft, stealing the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Aldrich may be frightened about living up to his father's achievement with 
the 1962 "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?," but he's confident that nobody 
could give him a better shot than the Redgrave sisters. 
</P>
<P>
"Some wonderful actresses were suggested to me -- people such as Elizabeth 
Taylor and Faye Dunaway," he says. "But I didn't know who to put them with as 
sisters. There was never a pairing that I was prepared to go forward with that 
could come up to the quality that Crawford and Davis brought to the movie." 
</P>
<P>
In casting Vanessa Redgrave in the less flamboyant role of Blanche, Aldrich 
says: 
</P>
<P>
"Having worked on the first picture -- and having watched it a countless number 
of times -- I knew how really difficult it is for the actress who's playing 
Blanche, because she doesn't have many things to do. She's paralyzed. She's in 
bed most of the time, or in a wheelchair. Vanessa, for as long as I'm able to 
remember, has been able to do more with a look, with a glance, with her eyes, 
than almost any other actor I've ever seen work. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the actor I wanted in the wheelchair, in a bed. She can do more with 
emotions than most actors could do with four legs and six hands and props." 
</P>
<P>
Nor was she worried about comparisons with the past, says Aldrich: "Her answer 
is that, being trained in the classics, no matter what role she does in the 
theater, somebody has done it before and is well known for it. So she came in 
here and just played the hell out of this character." 
</P>
<P>
"There is," says Lynn Redgrave, "a physical freedom between us as sisters. 
That's something you can't learn." 
</P>
<P>
As for Vanessa Redgrave, she says that one of the prime reasons she wanted to 
play Blanche is her fascination with "a person who has been destroyed and 
perverted by image-making, in an industry that makes images."

By LINDA WINER, Linda Winer is the theater critic for Newsday and New York 
Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not, on the surface of things, a good day -- or maybe epoch -- to be 
cornering Michelle Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the new Esquire profile says that a session with its reporter 
made Pfeiffer feel like vomiting. Then USA Today reveals that Harper's intends 
to print a $1,525 retouching bill for her photograph on that Esquire cover. 
And, shortly before we begin to talk, Jim Brown from the "Today" show has 
accused her of being rude to him on the set of "The Russia House," the glasnost 
thriller that opens Wednesday. He said, she says, that she was " 'having an 
actressy day' . . . an actressy day!" 
</P>
<P>
But, in fact, here sits Pfeiffer, looking less like some temperamental 
Hollywood commodity than a cornered forest creature, less like a bankable moody 
beauty than a thoughtful, intelligent but admittedly press-wary woman who just 
happens to have eyes that end somewhere above her ears. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to become a bigger person," she says with a quick, easy laugh that 
suggests what good company she must be with a couple of girlfriends and some 
coffee. "I came to a revelation the other day that there are more important 
things in life than being misquoted in an interview. So you're misquoted, 
people read it and they forget about it in three minutes. In the grand scheme 
of things, there are much, much more important things to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
Oh nuts, wisdom. From where the moguls sit, of course, Pfeiffer, 32, need not 
worry her fabulous head a bit. In the last three years, she has broken through 
the ranks of promising starlets with slim hips and fat hair and emerged with 
five major movies -- each more daring and confident than the last. 
</P>
<P>
She began this career roll as the fecund Earth Mother in "The Witches of 
Eastwick" (1987), then shattered expectations as the gum-chomping Italian Long 
Island widow in "Married to the Mob" (1988). Months later, she was sleek and 
elegant as the trendy restaurateur caught up with drug-runners in "Tequila 
Sunrise" (1988), then ineffably poignant as the saintly 17th-Century French 
sexual victim in "Dangerous Liaisons" (1989). 
</P>
<P>
Even so, perhaps nothing prepared audiences for Susie Diamond, the former 
hooker and sultry lounge singer in "The Fabulous Baker Boys" (1989) -- a woman 
tough and vulnerable and willing to make love to a grand piano while singing a 
pretty grand "Makin' Whoopee." 
</P>
<P>
About now, someone should note that this is where the media sends in the guys. 
Interviews with Pfeiffer are nearly always assigned to male journalists, 
smitten souls who've gone mental describing her face "as pale and smooth as 
porcelain . . . a wide, voluptuous mouth with a plump upper lip and two of the 
biggest, bluest, almond-shaped eyes you've ever seen." Or her "cornflower blue 
eyes -- even devoid of makeup . . . she turns enough heads to keep osteopaths 
in business for a week." 
</P>
<P>
Pfeiffer, of course, is a dish. Part of the Pfeiffer phenom, however, is that 
women like her too. It is hard to name another major actress today who is this 
interesting to both sexes. Yes, she is partly a throwback to the Golden Age 
goddess, but there also is a dark quality, an unpredictability, a willingness 
to play far beyond her looks and grow through roles. As she has put it, "Brave 
characters seem to be my theme." 
</P>
<P>
In the real world, bravery is a theme too -- just not the way you might expect. 
The woman is shy -- apparently shy enough to feel like vomiting after that 
Esquire interview. "I've always been pretty daring with my work," she explains 
softly. "But I'm not really very daring in my life. I'm pretty safe." 
</P>
<P>
Pfeiffer has been one of Harper's Bazaar's 10 most beautiful women, one of 
People's 25 intriguing people for both 1988 and 1989, the entertainer with whom 
J&amp;B Scotch drinkers would most want to have dinner, and on and on. She got 
her first Oscar nomination for "Dangerous Liaisons," her second, along with 
almost every other major critics' award, for "Baker Boys." 
</P>
<P>
But, right now, she is dressed -- almost hiding -- in a nondescript white 
T-shirt and simple quality baggies. She wears little makeup, no nail polish, no 
jewelry beyond a couple of hanging earrings and a few more little studs. There 
is a sweetness to her. She thinks before she speaks, punctuating the silences 
with a thoughtful "Ummmmm." Although she dislikes the inevitable invasion of 
privacy, she also seems to dislike facile answers. 
</P>
<P>
Does the beauty talk get to her? "Ummmmm," says Pfeiffer, who once said "the 
way my mouth curls up and my nose tilts, I should be cast as 'Howard the Duck.' 
" Now she sighs and runs her fingers through her hair the way Susie Diamond did 
when things got complicated. "It's not even that it gets to me. It just becomes 
boring for me. It's kinda a no-win subject." 
</P>
<P>
Director Jonathan Demme, who gave her the chance to cut loose into comedy with 
"Married to the Mob," has said that she has been "in touch with her gifts all 
along" and credits her "enormous patience with those of us who tended to focus 
first on how gorgeous she is." Does that sound right to her? "That's great for 
Jonathan to say," she says, chuckling. "But it's a no-win comment for me. It's 
a subject I have to avoid." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, she is obviously a long way from the Orange County surfer bunny who 
discovered her muse at 19 while working the checkout line at a Vons 
supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
By now, the Pfeiffer story is acquiring the aura of Hollywood legend, right up 
there with soda-fountain discoveries and sweater girls at Hollywood High. Only 
this one is the legend of the eldest daughter of an air-conditioning contractor 
in Midway City near Disneyland. She sold jeans in the mall, went to the beach, 
drifted in and out of junior college and school for court stenographers. The 
epiphany reportly came while she watched some woman complain about a cantaloupe 
at Vons. 
</P>
<P>
So Pfeiffer, almost a woman, asked herself what she really wanted to do with 
life, answered "actress," then signed up for a beauty pageant, won Miss Orange 
County, lost Miss Los Angeles -- but captured the eye of an agent. 
</P>
<P>
She went the usual starlet route. Her one line on "Fantasy Island" was "Who is 
he, Naomi?" She padded her bra to play a bombshell on "Delta House," TV's 
short-lived 1979 spinoff of "Animal House." She played a carhop in "The 
Hollywood Knights" and a deb in "Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon 
Queen," but her big break came in 1982 as Stephanie Zinone in "Grease 2." The 
movie disappeared; she did not. 
</P>
<P>
A year later came "Scarface," in which she played an ice goddess with an 
attitude opposite Al Pacino. She was so good that she only got offers then to 
play ice goddesses with attitudes. She turned them down and waited. And waited. 
She played a scared party girl in "Into the Night," a medieval woman who is 
cursed to turn into a bird at dawn in "Ladyhawke" and a difficult starlet in 
"Sweet Liberty." And she waited some more. 
</P>
<P>
Early in her young L.A. independence, she fell under the spell of a cult, which 
she said "brainwashed" her and absorbed a lot of her money. She was extricated 
from the messy business with the help of Peter Horton, now a star of 
"thirtysomething." They met in acting class, were married for seven years, 
divorced in 1987 and remain close friends. 
</P>
<P>
Horton has said that Pfeiffer "is a much bigger person than she was raised to 
believe." It is a helpful, even lovely, attempt to connect Pfeiffer the beach 
babe, with the private, intensely talented and self-critical perfectionist she 
is today. 
</P>
<P>
She feels the schism, though she's reluctant to analyze it too much. "Yeah," 
she admits, "it becomes a little bit schizophrenic. To begin with, just moving 
out of your hometown makes you a different kind of person than someone who 
stays. And I'm no exception to that rule. On the one hand, I'm the same girl I 
was in Orange County and, on the other hand, I lead a very different life. So 
there is a discrepancy and there will always be a discrepancy. As a result of 
that, I think I'll always feel somewhat homeless . . . no matter where I am." 
</P>
<P>
She seems less affected by her lack of arts training than her hometown is. 
"Well, I know it appears that nothing in my life prepared me for this. But, if 
you really analyzed it, you'd see there is a cause and effect for everything . 
. . see there was some event that we could go back to my childhood and find. 
Even though I feel completely unprepared, I know there's a method to this 
madness. I can't come up with it at the moment," she says. "Nor do I probably 
want to, but I'm sure that there is some plan to all of this." 
</P>
<P>
Her parents are surprised. "Shocked might be a better word," she says giggling 
like a daughter with a secret. "I think they're, uh, yeah, pleasantly 
surprised. I think shell-shocked, no pun intended. They're very supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, none of this explains what happened in the mere five years between 
"Grease 2" and the mature creative explosion that began in 1987. How did she 
get the courage not to settle for bimbo roles? How did she know she was worth 
so much more -- even without an education? 
</P>
<P>
"Some choices are automatic, instinctual, completely emotional. I'm moved by a 
role and I don't even know why. Other choices" -- a grimace -- "I aggravate for 
weeks and sometimes months." She won't say which are which, though she has said 
elsewhere that she never bothered to see "Tequila Sunrise." For now, she says, 
"It's pretty evident in my work when I aggravate." 
</P>
<P>
She has learned her craft in public, pulled off lots of different exotic 
accents and, in "Baker Boys," sang well enough to have fans requesting an 
album. But she also believes strongly in her acting lessons. "It's hard to 
learn while you're working because there's so much pressure on you," she says. 
"You have to come up with the goods on the spot and tend to fall into bad 
patterns and get comfortable. It's important to have a place where you can 
explore and fall on your face." 
</P>
<P>
As New Yorkers know, there was one full-facial splat-ola. Immediately after 
"Baker Boys," Pfeiffer put herself onstage in Central Park in a Hollywood 
all-star production of "Twelfth Night" for Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare 
Festival. Although her inexperience was obvious, her Olivia improved through 
the evening and she handled the role's tricky balance between elegance and 
foolishness with intelligence and wit. Other reviewers, however, saw it, well, 
another way. 
</P>
<P>
"Ummmmm," she recalls wincing. "I wanted to do something truly frightening. I'd 
come from movies and, though I find different characters challenging in their 
own way, you really put yourself out there on the stage. It was something I had 
never done. It was unbelievably terrifying. I look back and I think about what 
I did and I can't believe it. If you asked me to put on that costume and get on 
the stage right now, you couldn't pay me enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know in detail really what the Public Theatre meant. I didn't know 
people would make such a huge deal ... stupid me. Certainly, I thought people 
would come, but it turned into such an extravaganza, I cannot tell you. People 
flew in from Los Angeles. We had Sidney Lumet and we had Robert De Niro, every 
night some incredibly famous or powerful person. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Every night was sheer terror, but the night after the reviews came out was 
devastating. Having to get up there on that stage was unbelievable. But that 
was another example. . . . I got myself to the theater. I got myself dressed. I 
mustered up the courage to go on and then I gave one of the best shows I did 
during the entire run." She definitely would consider getting on a stage again. 
In Shakespeare? "Noooo." 
</P>
<P>
After five movies and her first play, she intended to take a nap. Instead, she 
did "The Russia House." 
</P>
<P>
That is, she moved to the Soviet Union for the first major Hollywood film to be 
made there that was not a co-production. Fred Schepisi directed Tom Stoppard's 
adaptation of John leCarre's thriller about a Russian physicist (Klaus Maria 
Brandauer) who uses a Russian woman (Pfeiffer) as liaison to an English 
publisher (Sean Connery). Which means she had to learn to speak English with a 
Russian accent and some Russian. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean, 'How did I make myself look haggard?' ," she asks with mock 
incredulity. "I was haggard. I was so tired." That's when she also was 
supposedly rude to the "Today" show. "I actually had agreed that they could 
come on the set, even though I felt strongly against it. But I said, 'Well, 
have them come on this unimportant scene.' Well, they ended up coming for the 
week -- every day for five days -- when I had my two biggest scenes in the 
film. I was . . . fit to be tied. I'm very passionate about my work. When it 
becomes a circus, it . . . demeans and becomes disrespectful to the process." 
</P>
<P>
After "Russia House," she made "Love Field," an interracial romance co-starring 
Dennis Haysbert, due out next fall. Next month, she joins Al Pacino to film 
"Frankie and Johnny at the Clair de Lune," an adaptation of Terrence McNally's 
play about two frumpy, middle-aged blue-collar lovers. Either this is the 
funniest casting since Dustin Hoffman was Sean Connery's son in "Family 
Business," or director Garry Marshall has rethought the concept. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, she has squeezed-in six months of normal life since "Love Field" -- 
and loved it. "It feels good. I could use another six months, but I won't take 
it now." She has been puttering around her West Los Angeles house, a 1917 
hacienda-style adobe, where she built her own fireplace and has two dogs and a 
cat and maybe another dog to come. She also has been playing in New York a bit 
with Fisher Stevens, whom she met while they were both appearing in "Twelfth 
Night." 
</P>
<P>
There had been stories about affairs with Michael Keaton and John Malkovich, 
but this one has lasted a year and a half. Stevens, more a character actor than 
a glamorous leading man, is artistic director of New York's Off-Off Broadway 
Naked Angel Theater. "We're sort of bi-coastal now. But he's a die-hard New 
Yorker. We've managed pretty well," she says with a grin, "so long as he's 
busy." She denies that her beauty is hard on relationships. "I've been pretty 
fortunate. I haven't been with jealous men." 
</P>
<P>
Though her career is soaring, Pfeiffer wasn't all that surprised by recent 
reports about the bad times for women in male-dominated Hollywood. "It was 
pretty frightening. You know, I didn't realize it had gotten that bad. I 
assumed we had made much more progress than we apparently have. It seems we've 
backslid, to use a 'born-again' Christian term." 
</P>
<P>
But she too has formed a production company to develop her own films -- 
including one about journalism with her friend Cher. "I don't have a huge 
interest in producing, but I do feel the shortage of interesting roles. More 
women need to write and actresses have to make better choices. If a movie is 
good, people will go see it -- whether the lead is a woman or a man." 
</P>
<P>
So far, she has resisted the temptation to join fellow actors in political 
activism. "I don't like the idea of just putting my name on some committee list 
or showing up at some benefit in a pretty dress. I'd want to get in there and 
roll up my sleeves and do something. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But -- here's that contradiction again -- she doesn't want to "draw attention 
to myself, so I stay away. No matter where I go, no matter what I do, people 
stare at me," she says soberly. "And I can't do anything about it. There isn't 
a moment in my life, unless I'm in my home . . . unless I'm behind closed doors 
in some way." 
</P>
<P>
Yet her buddy Cher gets looked at a lot and doesn't mind attracting attention, 
so why does it get to her? "Well, Cher's incredibly good at handling publicity. 
I'm not. I'm just not. And that's fine," she softens into a grin. "I can build 
a fireplace and she can't. So." 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't want to complain about fame's burden, "because I realize that I'm 
really fortunate. But, on some levels, it really is one." 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the clock. "You see the statistics and realize that the 
longevity of a female career, as opposed to a male career in this business, is 
just so much shorter. I'm not complaining or anything, but it is what it is. So 
I think, 'Well, the work is here now.' At some point, I'm going to want to stop 
and have a family and take some time off then. So I guess right now is a good 
time to work." 
</P>
<P>
She also knows that this has been a stunning few years. "It has been amazingly 
packed. But I can remember when I wasn't on such a roll. I remember my 
then-husband was having dinner with an agent and I remember (the agent) saying, 
'Well, Michelle's not as hot as she used to be.' And I thought, 'Maybe this 
just isn't going to happen for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Asked to play a game of "What if . . ." as in "What if you didn't get another 
job after 'Sweet Liberty,' " she emits an especially long "Ummmmm," runs her 
fingers through her hair again and repeats "What if nobody ever hired me again? 
Well . . . ummmm. I probably would have gone back to school . . . and become a 
psychiatrist." 
</P>
<P>
Why that? "Because it always fascinated me, what motivates people and what's in 
the little red wagon that we all drag behind us. That's probably why I went 
into acting." 
</P>
<P>
In her red wagon has always been a fear of being "found out. But, as I've 
gotten older, I realized everybody feels that way. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I think people will find out that I'm really not very talented. I'm 
really not very good. It's all been a big sham." 
</P>
<P>
And you're ugly? 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm really ugly," she says laughing. "But I think I've learned to live 
with that and know it's just my neurotic self."

FOR SOMEBODY WHO SAYS SHE BACKED INTO DIRECTING, PENNY MARSHALL IS DOING FINE, 
THANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN MITCHELL, Sean Mitchell is a Times free-lancer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It goes something like this . . . 
</P>
<P>
Carl Reiner, who used to write and direct "The Dick Van Dyke Show" and directed 
the film "Sibling Rivalry," is the father of Rob Reiner, who used to be on "All 
in the Family" and directed "When Harry Met Sally . . . " and "Misery" and used 
to be married to Penny Marshall, who was on "Laverne &amp; Shirley" and 
directed "Big" and is the sister of Garry Marshall, who wrote for "The Dick Van 
Dyke Show" and then produced "Happy Days" and "Laverne &amp; Shirley" and 
directed "The Flamingo Kid" and "Pretty Woman . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Which explains why . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you saw "Sibling Rivalry" recently and it had a coming attraction for the 
new movie "Awakenings," directed by Penny Marshall with a score by Randy 
Newman, the music on the trailer was actually borrowed from Garry Marshall's 
1987 movie "Overboard," which also had music by Randy Newman, since Newman's 
score for "Awakenings" wasn't ready yet. 
</P>
<P>
Okay, as Penny Marshall might say, we can come back to the credits later. But 
all this gets us into the world in which Marshall has emerged (she prefers the 
description, "I came up in such a whole backwards way") as a prominent 
Hollywood director, a term not often associated with someone other than a man. 
</P>
<P>
She has only made two movies that the public has seen, but one of them, the 
comedy "Big," was a big hit, and her third, "Awakenings" (Columbia), stars 
Robert De Niro and Robin Williams in a drama about a painfully shy doctor 
transformed by his experience treating a hopelessly ill man. It opens in Los 
Angeles on Thursday and across the rest of the country next month. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't my plan to do a drama or anything," says Marshall who, as we speak, 
is reclined on a couch, as is her fashion, at her ample 1940s home on an 
eastern slope of the Hollywood Hills. She reclines not in grandeur but in 
collapse, draped in a loose-fitting black jersey and slacks as she contemplates 
upcoming gum surgery and the scary possibility of life without cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't shake it," she says about the script for "Awakenings," adapted 
by Steve Zaillian ("The Falcon and the Snowman") from an autobiographical book 
by physician-author Oliver Sacks. "And the message of it: How special life is 
and how precious it is. Here I was sitting with all these scripts, complaining 
and worrying about my teeth, and here are people with real problems." 
</P>
<P>
On this afternoon, she is taking congratulatory calls about "Awakenings" from 
friends in the business -- actor Joe Pesci, producer Robert Greenhut and 
director Mike Nichols -- and offering a grumble of thanks to each in return. 
Her daughter, Tracy, 26, who wants to be an actress and lives on the premises, 
brings her a Diet Pepsi. She has got a chain of Marlboros going -- she cannot 
talk on the phone without one -- and wonders aloud how she planned to quit 
smoking with a $29 million movie about to open. Her friend Carrie Fisher is due 
to arrive with a Christmas tree (Marshall doesn't like to leave the house if 
possible and hates driving), and she's somehow got to get herself out the door 
to a screening of "The Russia House" in a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I stopped smoking for three weeks. I took the shot. But I got a report from 
New York there was a sound glitch on reel five. A cigarette flew into my mouth, 
OK?" 
</P>
<P>
When she first read the "Awakenings" script, sent to her by her agents at the 
Creative Artists Agency, Marshall says she cried. 
</P>
<P>
She took it to Dawn Steel, who was still in office presiding over pre-Sony 
Columbia, and "she wanted to make it. I called Bobby (De Niro), and he wanted 
to do it." They had a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some of her many funny friends counseled her against it. "I had friends who 
said, 'Why do you want to be in a hospital for four months?' I said, 'I was 
depressed in a toy store, what difference does it make?' I'm a depressed 
person. People said it was so brave to do a drama. I didn't think it was 
bravery. I figured I had an excuse: If it didn't work, I could say, well, 
'That's not my strength.' " 
</P>
<P>
Someone Marshall will identify only as "a very famous director" once gave her 
some important advice when she asked him, 'How exactly do you shoot a comedy?' 
And he said, 'High and low and in the middle. You decide in the editing room.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
"Awakenings" is anything but a comedy, yet Marshall found herself faced with 
the same challenge of trying to maintain a consistent tone, in this case one 
somewhere on the border between pity and hope. 
</P>
<P>
In the movie, De Niro plays a middle-aged man who has been catatonic for 30 
years as the result of a neurological disease he contracted during childhood. 
Into his grim hospital ward comes a quixotic research doctor, played by 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who has no experience with patients but becomes determined to 
"awaken" the man and other similarly afflicted patients with experimental 
drugs, even though he must battle the hospital's authorities every step of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (art director) Anton Furst, 'Don't make it look depressing. I don't 
want it to be this oppressive place. It's a hospital, the story has a sadness 
to it, the people have this disease, but let's not make it dark and dank.' " 
</P>
<P>
But neither could she let in too much light on the characters, she points out. 
"The hardest thing was not allowing Robin, who is funny, to be funny. Let other 
people be funny. Oliver Sacks himself is really funny. In person, he's this 
eccentric guy who carries a thermometer around with him and if it gets too hot 
he puts an ice pack on his head. Now, if I put that on Robin, they would think 
Robin's doing schtick. So, in some ways I pulled away from the real doctor." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the movie was in production, Sony had bought Columbia, Steel was 
gone and the team of Peter Guber and Jon Peters were on their way to the 
studio's top executive jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was interesting," Marshall says. "Dawn green-lighted it, and then Dawn 
wasn't there. I don't know who was there. And we were going a little bit over 
(budget). But they weren't yelling. So we figured maybe Sony liked it." 
</P>
<P>
Remembering how the cast and crew pondered the movie's fate as the studio 
changed ownership, she just now does a very funny imitation of Robin Williams 
doing an imitation of a Japanese executive watching the dailies: Oh, that Robin 
Williams guy, we like him, we give him more money! 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, including her own, Marshall carries off her responsibilities 
as a director through the power of understatement. "I administer in a very odd 
way -- begging, whatever. But it gets done." The main problem she sees for a 
woman directing a film, is that "girls cry." 
</P>
<P>
There have been so few women allowed behind the camera over the years, that 
when a woman actually produces a major hit, as Amy Heckerling did with "Look 
Who's Talking" or Marshall did with the more prestigious "Big," Hollywood 
buzzes with political talk of a victory over the men's club that runs the 
studios. But you will not hear such talk from Marshall, who puts down the phone 
to answer a question about being a role model for women in the film business. 
</P>
<P>
"I came up in such a whole backwards way that's so different from most of the 
girls now," Marshall says. "I mean, I didn't care, I didn't want it. I wasn't 
trying to get it. So I don't have the anger. I didn't go beating down any 
doors, saying, 'Accept me for this.' I was trying to get a date. You know?" 
</P>
<P>
In the late '70s Marshall, who is now 47, was one of the leads in the hugely 
popular "Laverne &amp; Shirley" on ABC, her hair teased into a lacquered 1950s 
helmet as she traded quips with Cindy Williams in a Milwaukee beer-bottling 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Since she had never considered herself pretty enough to be an actress in the 
first place, when "Laverne &amp; Shirley" ground to a halt in 1982 she was open 
to other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
It was her agents at the omnipotent Creative Artists Agency, she says, who, 
more than anyone, pushed her into the deep waters of directing. 
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, I think that CAA decided I was going to direct. They're very 
powerful. They say something and you do it." She laughs as she says this, but 
it's not, you know, a big laugh. 
</P>
<P>
She directed some episodes of "Laverne &amp; Shirley" toward the end, and as 
the show was winding down, Paramount (which had been her TV home) offered her 
the chance to direct the feature "The Joy of Sex," with John Belushi starring. 
But then Belushi was found dead at the Chateau Marmont, and that was that, 
although the movie was eventually made, unsuccessfully, by Martha Coolidge. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, she was about to move back to New York City, where she grew up, when 
she got a call from one of her friends at Paramount, producer Larry Gordon 
("Die Hard," "Field of Dreams") who was making a comedy with Whoopi Goldberg 
called "Jumpin' Jack Flash." The production was in trouble and Gordon wanted a 
new director, someone who could work well with Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an interesting experience," says Marshall, who took the job. "I 
hadn't even acted in very many films. A three-camera TV show is very different 
from a movie set. I was so used to television, the first day, this guy comes 
down and says, 'Now we have to shoot it from this way, and this way and this 
way.' I said, 'What?' " 
</P>
<P>
Editing, mixing, lenses, lighting -- she knew nothing about any of it. She did, 
on the other hand, have directors like her brother Garry, Steven Spielberg and 
James Brooks she could call in a pinch. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Brooks would come over and visit. Friends would come over and visit and 
I'd put 'em in the movie. Jim Belushi, Jon Lovitz, Carol Kane, Tracey Ullman, 
Michael McKean -- they were all in 'Jumpin' Jack Flash.' " 
</P>
<P>
The picture, released in 1986, was neither well received nor commercially 
successful. But the fate of "Jumpin' Jack Flash" did not deter James L. Brooks 
from tapping her to direct "Big" two years later for his new company, Gracie 
Films, at 20th Century-Fox, made possible by his triumph with "Terms of 
Endearment." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks was also a friend from the old days, from when she and Rob Reiner, 
Albert Brooks, Richard Dreyfuss and others would gather at the Reiner-Marshall 
house and mope over their fortunes in Hollywood. "The weird thing," Marshall 
recalls, "is we were all sitting around there not even knowing that most of us 
were doing OK. Rob was on 'All in the Family,' Jim Brooks was writing 'The Mary 
Tyler Moore Show.' We're all sitting there going 'aggghhh,' thinking we were 
failures. Only Rick Dreyfuss was successful because he had won an Academy Award 
for 'The Goodbye Girl.' That was considered successful." 
</P>
<P>
If Brooks showed her any favoritism in selecting Marshall over more proven 
hands to direct "Big," written by Anne Spielberg and Gary Ross, the favor was 
more than repaid in the resulting film. Starring Tom Hanks as a kid who gets a 
magical chance to see life as a grown-up toy executive and can't wait to get 
back to age 13, "Big" turned out to be an accomplished comedy that was embraced 
by audiences and critics alike. 
</P>
<P>
The experience of making the movie, however, was no piece of cake for its woman 
director, and there were some gender-related problems with the crew. "There 
were times when I felt betrayed," Marshall says. 'I used to call Jim Brooks 
during 'Big' and say, 'I'm sorry,' and he would say, 'Don't say that! Stop 
apologizing! The crew doesn't want to hear that.' " 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, the hardest thing about "Big," according to Marshall, was 
"making it believable" as a story. "If you commented on it, you were dead. It 
wouldn't hold." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Nichols, who passed up the chance to direct "Big," says he was surprised 
and impressed when he finally saw the finished film. "I don't know Penny that 
well," says Nichols, "but I'm an enormous admirer of her. In her apparently -- 
but not really -- confused way to have come up with these razor-sharp movies. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see in 'Big' what Penny saw in it. I thought it was far too concepty 
for me. I never quite saw the Tom Hanks character as more than an idea, and she 
found the reality of it -- she and Tom Hanks. I admire them for it. I couldn't 
have done it. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, she's a first-rate director. She's the real thing. And that is mainly 
because she understands the things that happen between people. She knows how to 
make something happen on screen. That's how you can tell if someone can direct. 
It doesn't matter where the camera is. Nobody knows where the camera is or what 
the camera does. You shouldn't know, it's not important." 
</P>
<P>
Carrie Fisher, the actress and writer responsible for Nichols' latest film, 
"Postcards From the Edge," has come and gone by now, having arrived at the door 
with a 24-inch-high midget tree -- a little joke, anything to brighten the 
Hollywood afternoon -- as well as a big eight-footer that she stashed 
temporarily out of sight in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall and Fisher go way back, and their adventures together have included 
the time they jetted to Barbados with Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel as traveling 
companions. 
</P>
<P>
During her 30-minute visit, Fisher informed me that she "dresses" Penny. "I do 
all her shopping for her. It's something that happens when you're admitted to 
the Directors Guild -- you're not allowed to shop anymore." 
</P>
<P>
When she hears that Marshall claims not to be "seeing anyone" at the moment, 
Fisher says with a poker face, "She's not seeing anyone, but she's hearing 
people, and you worry about that." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall has been married twice -- the first time while still a student at the 
University of New Mexico, to a football player who fathered her daughter. Her 
nine-year marriage to Rob Reiner ended in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of Reiner and Marshall becoming successful movie directors after 
starring in long-running sitcoms would have been off the betting charts in Las 
Vegas. But now that they've both come this far, she must feel some competition 
with him. Or does she? 
</P>
<P>
From her couch position she sings out a long, low, sweet "Noooooo, he's a very 
talented guy. He's good. I always thought he was good. That's why I thought 
he'd take care of me. Because I knew he'd always work. So I don't feel 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
She admits she did feel "a little strange" when Columbia, which also released 
Reiner's recent film "Misery," originally scheduled both "Awakenings" and 
"Misery" to open on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
"I objected to that. I called Rob and said, 'Hi. Do you really want to come out 
the same night? Do you want to be looking at your (ticket) lines when I'm 
looking at mine? I think not.' " 
</P>
<P>
The two still talk, she says, mainly for reasons having to do with business. 
"You know, 'Did you work with this person? Can they get through a scene without 
falling down?' 
</P>
<P>
"I've also got a brother who makes movies and who's been more than helpful to 
me. So, it's the family business. We make movies. And my friends make movies. 
It's not competitive. It's such a hard job, you wish them all the luck and 
strength to finish these things." 
</P>
<P>
Competitive or not, it's not out of the question, the way their careers are 
going at the moment, that early next year or some year in the future Marshall 
and Reiner could both be nominated for Oscars on the same ballot. If that 
happened, can she imagine the scene on Oscar night? As Oliver Stone or Sydney 
Pollack or some other celebrity presenter tears open the envelope holding the 
name for the academy's best director, the television cameras zoom into the 
audience for a close-up of her face and then to the face of her former husband.

ROBERT SOBIESZEK -- AN EXPERT WITNESS AT THE MAPPLETHORPE TRIAL -- TAKES OVER 
THE COUNTY MUSEUM'S PHOTOGRAPHY DEPARTMENT

This was Robert Sobieszek's year to be called to duty. After 20 years at the 
venerable George Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y., he answered a call from Los 
Angeles and agreed to take over the photography department at the County Museum 
of Art. But before he could cram his belongings into a moving van and head 
West, he had to take care of a piece of legal business. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing as routine as a traffic ticket, nothing as personal as his will or his 
income tax. This was important public business, nothing less than the art 
world's trial of the year: the Cincinnati obscenity trial involving Robert 
Mapplethorpe's photographs. 
</P>
<P>
A prominent curator, organizer of 52 photography exhibitions and author of four 
books and 12 exhibition catalogues on the history of photography, Sobieszek was 
summoned as an expert witness. He and three other photography specialists were 
asked to prove that Mapplethorpe's photographs are art. 
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of many in the art community, the jury took the word of the art 
experts. On Oct. 5, Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center and its director, 
Dennis Barrie, were acquitted on charges of pandering obscenity and using 
children in nudity-related material. 
</P>
<P>
"The trial was a democratic process and it worked," the 47-year-old curator 
said, during an interview in his new office at the museum. "The jury hated the 
pictures, but the prosecution failed to prove that they lacked redeeming 
artistic, scientific or political value," as required by the U.S. Supreme 
Court's test of obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
Was the trial a benchmark event, then? "It was just a skirmish," Sobieszek 
said. "We won the skirmish, but the war is still out there. The self-appointed 
guardians of our morals are more organized and better funded than the art 
community. The only good thing to come out of the trial is that it might make 
our foes a little more hesitant to go to court." 
</P>
<P>
The art world is "vulnerable because we are considered elitist, dangerous and 
unnecessary," he said. "It's easier to fight us than to deal with real social 
and political issues that can't be solved, like the homeless and the deficit." 
</P>
<P>
The specter of censorship has spread throughout the arts community during the 
past two years, and it has haunted the National Endowment for the Arts in a 
bitter fight about using tax monies to finance art that might be deemed 
offensive. Performance artists, painters, dancers and actors have all been 
involved in the struggle. "It's an all-out attack," Sobieszek said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, photography has been in the eye of the storm and photography curators 
are feeling embattled. This fact became clear at Oracle, an annual retreat for 
photography curators, held this year in Santa Rosa. "This was the eighth annual 
meeting of the group, and it was the most serious yet," Sobieszek said. "The 
two main issues were censorship and audience." 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of censorship, the group decided that "it wouldn't accomplish 
much for 80 photography curators to send postcards to Congress," Sobieszek 
said. "Our primary responsibility is to take a close look at what we exhibit 
and how we exhibit it in terms of the public. Photography has taken off on a 
trajectory of its own and it has left the audience behind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an interesting problem to try to communicate ideas about art to a 
genuinely lay audience," said Sobieszek, who testified on videotape for the 
Cincinnati trial. "We talk about a lay audience at museums, but they have 
already indicated an interest in art by coming to museums. In Cincinnati, this 
was genuine laity. Only one member of the jury had ever entered a museum and 
that person had gone on a field trip in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the questions that had to be answered was, 'Does art have to be 
pretty?' We struggled to come up with a good example of art that is not pretty, 
but one that would be known to the jurors. Hieronymus Bosch is a good example 
because there are more horrific things going on in his paintings than in 
Mapplethorpe's photographs, but the jurors wouldn't have known his work. We 
thought of Picasso and Goya, but Picasso is considered a rampant example of 
errant modernism and elitism, and Goya is not well enough known," Sobieszek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally came up with Van Gogh's self-portrait with his ear cut off. The 
only way Van Gogh could express the experience of cutting off his ear was to 
paint a picture of it -- because he was a visual artist. In the same way, 
Mapplethorpe was trying to understand things that were going on in his life," 
Sobieszek said, referring to a period during the 1970s when the late 
photographer frequented New York's demimonde of leather bars and bath houses, 
and produced homoerotic and sadomasochistic images. Five of these photographs 
plus two works that depict partially undressed minors, were at issue in the 
Cincinnati trial. 
</P>
<P>
Expert witnesses were charged with "establishing a definition of art as 
fundamental expression," Sobieszek said. His specific task was to talk about 
the importance of context, and he had to admit, "Yes, if some of Mapplethorpe's 
photographs were badly printed in a sleazy magazine in a porn shop, they might 
be interpreted as pornography. But when those images are beautifully composed, 
printed and framed and they are in a museum as part of a larger body of work 
and an integral part of an exhibition, it's a very different issue." It's time 
for curators to reconsider "the issue of representation -- what you are seeing, 
what exactly are you looking at when you see a photograph -- while presenting 
wonderful images to an audience that already knows the answers to those 
questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The best strategy for educating the public is not installing didactic panels at 
museums, he said, but organizing small shows that address specific aspects of 
photographic representation, working with docents and going out into the 
community to give lectures on critical issues. 
</P>
<P>
Like most curators, Sobieszek is new to art's battleground, but he is a veteran 
in the field of photography. He has held various curatorial posts at the George 
Eastman House since 1969, serving as director of photographic collections from 
1981 until he resigned this fall. During that period he also held teaching 
posts at Cornell University and the University of Rochester. His exhibitions 
include "The New American Pastoral: Landscape Photography in the Age of 
Questioning" and "The Art of Persuasion: A History of Advertising Photography." 
In addition to authoring such books and catalogues as " 'This Edifice is 
Colossal': Nineteenth-Century Architectural Photography," he has co-edited with 
Peter C. Bunnell a 51-volume publication, "The Sources of Modern Photography" 
and the 62-volume "The Literature of Photography." 
</P>
<P>
Going to work for the County Museum of Art is a big leap, however. The move 
from Rochester to Los Angeles not only took Sobieszek from the East to the West 
Coast, it removed him from a relatively small, specialized institution with a 
world-renowned collection of photography to a huge general art museum that's a 
fledgling in the field of photography. 
</P>
<P>
Reminded of the difference, Sobieszek rattled off some figures: The George 
Eastman House has 500,000 photographs; LACMA has 2,700. On the other hand, 
Eastman has a staff of 82; LACMA employs around 400. The annual budget at 
Eastman is $3.6 million tops; at the county museum it hovers just under $30 
million. LACMA also requires a lot more paper work, Sobieszek observed after a 
few days on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Sobieszek will direct the youngest of the museum's 10 curatorial departments, 
which was established in 1983 with a $1-million grant from the Ralph M. Parsons 
Foundation. He succeeds Kathleen Gauss, who presided over a small but lively 
and increasingly visible program before resigning earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the come-down from 500,000 to 2,700 photographs, Sobieszek insisted 
that he isn't starting from scratch. "I didn't want to come to a hinterland 
outpost to defend the faith. Photography has evolved tremendously over the last 
decade in Los Angeles. It's becoming a national center of photography," he 
said, citing an increase of photography shows at the County Museum of Art, 
along with the J. Paul Getty Museum's 1984 acquisition of 18,000 photographs 
and the collections of the Huntington Library Art Galleries, the California 
Museum of Photography in Riverside and UCLA's Grunwald Center. The Museum of 
Contemporary Art got into the act with exhibitions of works by John Baldessari 
and Max Yavno, he added, but what he has found most surprising here is the 
growth of the gallery scene and photography's prominent place in it. 
</P>
<P>
The mixture of showcases contribute to a lively community, but there's plenty 
of room for LACMA's program to develop, he said. "Because of the museum's 
location and its public draw, we may be able to reach a different audience." 
</P>
<P>
Photography leaders have speculated that Sobieszek's arrival signals a 
heightened commitment to photography at LACMA and that the force of his 
personality will strengthen the Southern California scene considerably. "I'm 
really pleased about having Bob in the neighborhood. It bodes well for Los 
Angeles," said Arthur Ollman, director of the Museum of Photographic Art in San 
Diego. "Anyone who knows him knows that you don't invite Robert Sobieszek 
aboard if you don't expect to have a very vigorous and aggressive curator. He 
doesn't lie back and go with the flow. He has created powerful exhibitions and 
he is a great writer." 
</P>
<P>
Sobieszek isn't about to lay out a grand new program until he has assessed the 
situation. He won't say what his first big show will be, but he will admit, "I 
have managed to get the promise of two very important American photographers to 
do their retrospectives here." None of his exhibitions will go on the walls 
until early 1993, however. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he has established three admittedly vague priorities: "First 
is to build a very respectable collection while refining and increasing the 
existing one. We will emphasize modern photography, particularly since World 
War II, but we will also buy older work. We don't have a single Daguerreotype, 
but I don't want one just to have an example. I want one or two spectacular 
Daguerreotypes. There's no need to duplicate what the Getty has done and that 
would be impossible." 
</P>
<P>
His second priority is to review the kinds of exhibitions that the museum has 
done and assess the record. Third is to "try to define a set of programs and 
exhibitions that will respond to the varied community of artists, collectors 
and general audience. We need to look at what has been done and what response 
it has had -- what went right and wrong -- and build on the correct gestures," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Photography has had a very low profile at most general art museums until the 
past decade. But as photography has gained respect as an art form and wedged 
its way into museums and galleries, it has become so thoroughly assimilated 
into the larger picture of contemporary art that it can be as difficult to 
define a photograph as for expert witnesses to decide when a photograph is art. 
"All distinctions are blurred now. The challenge is to make some sense of this 
and to look at how photography has changed in the last decade," Sobieszek said. 
</P>
<P>
As for his move from a specialized photography center to a massive art museum, 
he said, "I don't think photography should be treated as a separate medium. 
There was a time for separatism -- at the point when it wasn't seen as art. In 
the '60s only two museums, the Museum of Modern Art and the George Eastman 
House, were exhibiting and promoting photography. We've pretty well won that 
battle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bickering about definitions of art and photography continue within the art 
world, but Sobieszek isn't very interested. "I don't see any difference between 
Edward Weston and Hamish Fulton. Both are artists who use the camera to make 
art," he said. "The person who wants to make silver prints of the landscape can 
co-exist with the one who makes monumental politically charged images. There's 
room for the whole spectrum. There are not two worlds. There is one and it's 
called visual art."

12 EUROPEAN NATIONS END S. AFRICA INVESTMENT BAN; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY: THE LEADERS ALSO TAKE GIANT STRIDES TOWARD POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
UNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Europe's leaders took giant strides toward political as well as economic unity 
Saturday and, as if to underscore their determination, jointly lifted a ban on 
investment in South Africa, demanded Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and provided 
$1 billion in food aid to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The heads of the 12 European Community nations struck only one sour note, on 
international trade. Although they approved a resolution calling for 
resurrecting the negotiations that broke down last week, several of them 
individually blamed the United States for the deadlock and insisted that 
America make the next move. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the leaders set in motion a process designed ultimately to enable 
their nations to speak with one voice on foreign policy and to blend their 
individual economies into what could become the most potent economic force in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
Disagreements remained on how to move toward a common currency for all 12 EC 
nations. And the leaders stepped gingerly around the highly charged question of 
whether they should somehow combine their military forces. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for a continent divided by two world wars in the first half of the century, 
the progress seemed extraordinary. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose embrace 
of European unity has allayed fears that the newly reunited Germany would seek 
to dominate the Continent, said Saturday's actions inaugurated "a decisive 
phase for European union, one of the great dreams of our century." 
</P>
<P>
South African policy served to demonstrate Europe's desire to stand together on 
controversies of global scope. In recognition of "the movement under way aimed 
at the complete abolition of apartheid," the 12 European leaders lifted a 
four-year-old ban on European investment in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Pending further reforms, the EC maintained other economic sanctions, including 
an embargo of arms sales to South Africa and a boycott of South African steel 
and gold. 
</P>
<P>
As the European leaders acknowledged, South African President Frederik W. de 
Klerk has reversed the racial policies of some of his predecessors and freed 
anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, 
who had been imprisoned for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the ANC quickly condemned Europe's lifting of the investment ban as 
premature. Spokeswoman Gil Marcus, charging that white-led security forces are 
still killing ANC members, demanded: "How many lives do you want it still to 
cost?" 
</P>
<P>
On the more abstract question of whether Europe should conduct a forced march 
toward political and economic union, only British Prime Minister John Major 
refrained from a wholehearted commitment. But his mild and measured tone, in 
stark contrast to the sarcasm that his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, 
displayed at the last such meeting in October, encouraged the European 
Community's other 11 heads of government. 
</P>
<P>
In a phrase that Thatcher would never have used, Major declared it "perfectly 
legitimate" for the 12 EC nations to press toward unity even though 
disagreements remain. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a menu," Major said. "Our favorite dishes are on that menu, so are 
others' favorite dishes, but the Community has not yet determined what orders 
to place." 
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, the host of the two days of meetings 
that ended Saturday, replied at a separate press conference: "The important 
thing is that all 12 guests have sat down to table." 
</P>
<P>
Both were discussing the prospect of political union. Among the relatively easy 
issues for a committee of European officials to thrash out are whether to 
establish "European citizenship" and how a central European government should 
deal with environmental, energy and health policy. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will also tackle the more sensitive questions of a common foreign 
and security policy. The European heads of government acknowledged the 
difficulty of putting a single umbrella over the military policies of nations 
as diverse as France, which has long insisted on maintaining its own nuclear 
force, and Ireland, which is neutral and not a member of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Major, despite his disarming style, emphasized that the plan for political 
union would require the unanimous consent of the 12 countries. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis, for one, was optimistic. "A 
few weeks ago," he said, "it appeared impossible for defense policy even to be 
mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
The committee on political union is to finish its work by next fall, to give 
the 12 national parliaments time to adopt its product by the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
A similar timetable faces a separate committee on economic and monetary union. 
At their last conference in October, 11 of the heads of government decided to 
march toward a common currency, with Thatcher the odd leader out. 
</P>
<P>
Major served notice that he too objected, on grounds that to adopt a common 
currency would be to leap into the unknown. He promised to prepare by early 
next month his own, more modest plan for economic union, including a common 
currency only if money markets demonstrated they preferred that to today's 12 
national currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Italian Finance Minister Guido Carli, criticizing Major's approach to what he 
called an essentially political issue, said, "This matter cannot be left 
entirely to market forces." 
</P>
<P>
The 12 leaders found themselves split over one pressing issue of current 
economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of last week's collapse of international trade talks over American 
demands that Europe dismantle its costly farm subsidy system, the 12 managed to 
approve language in support of negotiating "a balanced political signal that we 
actually want and expect those talks to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Other signals from Rome were not so clear. Even though his election was two 
weeks behind him, German Chancellor Kohl showed no sign of abandoning German 
farmers, who vehemently oppose cuts in farm subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot at all accept the idea that Germany should untie the . . . knot," 
Kohl said. "Everyone will have to help find a solution." 
</P>
<P>
Spanish and Portuguese leaders struck similar themes. And Jacques Delors, 
president of the European Commission, the EC's executive branch, castigated the 
Americans for meddling in Europe's efforts to preserve its rural countryside. 
</P>
<P>
"American negotiators must stop insulting us around the world and isolating us. 
. . ," he declared. "They asked for too much too soon. They are mainly 
responsible for the failure." 
</P>
<P>
On many of the other major issues of the day, the 12 European leaders had 
little difficulty reaching unanimity. 
</P>
<P>
On the Persian Gulf crisis, they expressed "relief" at Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein's decision to release all foreign hostages but emphasized their "deep 
concern at Iraq's failure to withdraw, at its oppressive and inhuman occupation 
of Kuwait and its attempt to destroy the fabric of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Expressing support for "a dialogue of the sort President Bush has offered," 
they also expressed their own interest in a meeting between Andreotti and Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz. Shortly afterwards, Iraq canceled Aziz's scheduled 
meeting with Bush on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a conscious effort not to link Iraq's invasion of Kuwait to the longstanding 
Arab-Israeli conflict, the 12 European leaders issued a separate declaration 
condemning recent Israeli reprisals against Palestinians. In a split with the 
United States, they said they would support a Mideast peace conference under 
U.N. sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
The $1 billion in food for the Soviet Union, which the 12 European leaders had 
tentatively approved Friday, is to be divided into one part gifts and two parts 
loan guarantees. To improve the Soviets' primitive and corrupt food 
distribution system, the EC promised about $550 million in technical assistance 
next year and an undetermined sum in 1992.

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Iraqi government rejected all dates offered by President Bush for talks in 
Baghdad and made it clear Saturday that, in any case, Iraq does not want to 
talk about the same things that Washington does. 
</P>
<P>
A communique from the Revolutionary Command Council, Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein's inner circle, accused Bush of trying to impose a schedule on Iraq. 
The statement said that, in talks with Washington, Iraq would not discuss any 
U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq had rejected that resolution and would not deal with its details (in any 
talks)," the communique said. It repeated Iraq's position that the talks must 
encompass a variety of Middle East issues, including the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
On learning of this development, an Administration spokesman in Washington said 
it shows that Iraq is not serious about U.S.-Iraqi talks. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has repeatedly emphasized that any Baghdad-Washington talks undertaken at 
his initiative would be limited to the U.N. demand for the unconditional 
withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Washington stressed that limitation again Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A top aide to Secretary of State James A. Baker III declared that the proposed 
meeting between Baker and Iraqi President Hussein, if it occurs, will be brief 
and blunt -- and will not be allowed to turn into real negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make it as clear as we can to Saddam Hussein (at any meeting 
with Baker) we are serious about enforcing the Security Council resolutions," 
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said on Cable News Network's 
"Evans and Novak" program. 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein will then have to make up his own mind on what he's going to do 
about it," Eagleburger said. 
</P>
<P>
He said any Baker-Hussein session is likely to last "five minutes to five 
hours" -- and contacts are unlikely to continue for more than a day or two. He 
stressed that the discussions would not include negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"If you say 'no negotiations' and you mean it, then there aren't any 
negotiations," Eagleburger said. 
</P>
<P>
A scheduled meeting this Monday in Washington between President Bush and Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz was declared "on hold" Friday by Bush, who rejected 
the Jan. 12 date Iraq had proposed for a meeting in Baghdad between Baker and 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq effectively ruled out any possibility of the Dec. 17 meeting when it 
announced Saturday that Aziz would not fly to Washington as tentatively planned 
and proclaimed that "Iraq alone" would set the date for any visit by Baker to 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a spokesman for President Bush, who was spending the weekend at 
Camp David, Md., said the Iraqi statement proves that Baghdad is not serious 
about the proposed talks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have communicated to the Iraqis that mutually satisfactory dates should be 
set," spokesman John Herrick said from the presidential retreat. "Today's 
announcement is just a reaffirmation of Iraqi unwillingness to deal seriously 
with the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's date of Jan. 12 for the Baker visit was turned down by Bush because 
it is only three days before a U.N. deadline of Jan. 15 for Iraq to withdraw 
from occupied Kuwait or face the threat of military attack by international 
military forces deployed in the Persian Gulf. Washington considered the Iraqi 
scheduling a stall and asked for Baghdad talks no later than Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's communique of the Revolutionary Command Council insisted that Bush 
had offered Iraq only two dates for the Baghdad meeting, not a dozen, as Bush 
on Friday said he had suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Late Saturday, government spokesman Latif Jasim tried to soften the negative 
tone of the council's communique. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the disagreement, we still hope the Administration responds positively 
to our proposal," he said. "We want to solve this date (problem)." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if Iraq would budge on its scheduling, Jasim responded: "I cannot 
decide this. Since we gave your President Bush the freedom to pick the date, we 
have the freedom to pick a date for Baker." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials here expressed doubt that talks would take place. "I don't know 
where we go from here," an official said. "But they know our phone number." 
</P>
<P>
The row with Washington put the brakes on Iraq's efforts to open talks with 
U.S. allies in Europe and the Arab world. A meeting with representatives of the 
12-member European Community depended on talks first taking place in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Iraqi diplomats in Baghdad were approaching European ambassadors 
to ask whether the EC might reissue an invitation, even if the talks with Bush 
evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi officials had also hoped that the opening to the Bush Administration 
would encourage Saudi Arabia to open talks with Baghdad. Saudi Arabia is host 
to hundreds of thousands of U.S. and allied troops. 
</P>
<P>
The snag in U.S.-Iraqi talks gave rise to a renewal of warlike propaganda in 
Iraqi newspapers and on television. "The pack of villains, if it does not give 
up its arrogance, will find that a pack of (Muslim) believers is ready for 
military confrontation," warned the government paper Al Jumhuriya. 
</P>
<P>
Television broadcast a scene of Hussein riding a white horse while reviewing 
troops, followed by film showing legions of marching soldiers and units 
chanting praise to the Iraqi strongman. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a visiting Islamic delegation, Hussein also lambasted Persian 
Gulf allies of the United States for alleged debauchery and pledged that, 
although Iraq does not seek war, it would fight if attacked. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) renewed 
Democratic complaints that America's allies are not pulling their financial 
weight in the Persian Gulf effort, which he said will cost almost $37 billion 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Allied support has been woefully inadequate," Gephardt told reporters at a 
news conference. "It's been too little and too slow in coming." 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt and Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the major foreign financial 
backers of the anti-Iraq coalition -- Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab 
Emirates, Germany, Japan and South Korea -- have pledged to provide only $10.6 
billion, or 29% of the total cost. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has delivered only 21% of its promised $4 billion, they said. And while 
Saudi Arabia has promised $10 billion for the operation, the desert kingdom 
already has received a windfall of at least $43.8 billion from rising oil 
prices, they charged. 
</P>
<P>
"We're putting up a red flag today," Gephardt said, warning President Bush that 
he must be more aggressive in securing financial backing from America's allies 
if he wants Congress to approve additional spending. 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt and Schumer also said the allies should commit more troops to the 
operation. "I've told the President that if body bags go back to the United 
States, they've got to go to London, Paris and Cairo as well," Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams reported from Baghdad, and McManus reported from Washington.

<P>
Al Jacobs, a Los Angeles engineer whose son is serving in the Persian Gulf, 
voted for President Bush. But now he plans to march against him. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Cereseto of Orange County has been an anti-war protester since the 
death of her husband in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Thayler, a 19-year-old Riverside college student, opposes the buildup in 
the Mideast, fearing he will be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
Their reasons for opposing U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf are as varied 
as their backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, they are part of a small but growing and highly eclectic peace 
movement across the Southland that has become more vocal as a Jan. 15 deadline 
for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait nears. Even Saddam Hussein's decision to free 
foreign hostages has fueled -- rather than defused -- their furor. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't be deterred until we see President Bush taking the troops out," said 
Carol Jahnkow, director of the Peace Resource Center in San Diego. "If 
anything, people are seeing progress, and we want to keep up our efforts." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, protests in the Southland have yet to draw the numbers that marches 
and rallies have drawn across the country. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 20, a day selected by a network of peace organizations for nationwide 
protests, 4,000 people marched down Broadway to Times Square in New York; 1,500 
raised their voices in San Francisco. But in Los Angeles, there were only 400. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the smaller crowds here may lie in the nature of the region 
itself. It is more difficult to spawn a movement in Southern California cities 
than in other major cities, organizers say. "It is simply harder to get people 
out of their houses in L. A." said Leila Rand, a spokeswoman with the Los 
Angeles Coalition Against U.S. Intervention in the Middle East. "When you have 
a demonstration in L. A., how far are you expecting people to drive?" 
</P>
<P>
But while scattered protests drew only a handful of demonstrators months ago, 
rallies now draw scores, even hundreds. Throughout the region, an event is 
planned virtually every week, often by groups newly formed in response to U.S. 
involvement in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
Today, a teach-in organized by the Los Angeles Coalition Against U.S. 
Intervention in the Middle East is scheduled at Fairfax High School in Los 
Angeles. In several cities and towns, including Los Angeles, San Diego, Laguna 
Beach and Seal Beach, small rallies are held every weekend. Some, like a recent 
one at Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley, drew 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
"Is anti-war sentiment growing?" asked one father, whose son was deployed to 
the Middle East. "No, it is exploding." 
</P>
<P>
"Even in Orange County, we have a peace movement -- and we are usually not out 
in front in those things," said Cereseto, 68, a peace activist for about 50 
years and a founder of the month-old Orange County Coalition for Peace in the 
Middle East. This group, like others in the Southland, is circulating petitions 
to be presented to Bush in January, as well as organizing teach-ins at colleges 
and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Among the activists are offspring of Vietnam-era protesters and longtime 
members of peace organizations who have remained involved over the years in 
anti-nuclear weapons and environmental movements. 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as Jeanne and Bruce Ertle, are new to anti-war protests. 
</P>
<P>
The Ertles, of San Diego, recently joined the weekly Sunday peace vigil in 
Balboa Park. Their two sons, Stephan, 19, and Jeffrey, 24, have joined them in 
opposing the use of U.S. military force, which, they say, would divert funds 
from more necessary programs for the poor. And such a venture, they say, would 
only create more unrest in the already-tense Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do this, it's going to create an endless chain of problems later because 
we are going to alienate the Arab world," said Bruce Ertle, 50, a graphic 
artist who had traditionally voted Republican and grew up in a military family. 
</P>
<P>
Also among the ranks are people like Al and Norma Jacobs, who have sons or 
daughters, husbands or wives who have been sent to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a peacenik or a flower child; I am just a guy who has a son out in 
the Persian Gulf and who sees all these young fellas out there," Al Jacobs 
said. "Bush is not God. And what he's doing now really doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
For the Jacobses, the gulf crisis has forced them to accept political allies 
among people they might ordinarily avoid. Unlike some of the more ardent 
anti-war activists, they shun such radical acts as flag burning. In fact, 
alarmed by what they regarded as unpatriotic rhetoric, the couple walked out of 
their first political meeting two weeks ago in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But the Jacobses quickly realized they could ill afford to ignore what they now 
regard as the other half of the peace movement, the more traditional activists. 
Today, they have united in their efforts to organize a nationwide demonstration 
in early January. 
</P>
<P>
Although the movement's leaders are buoyed by the diversity the anti-war effort 
has attracted, it presents a dilemma as well. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate political neophytes and longtime protesters, organizers say, 
they must focus their message carefully: They oppose the war and support the 
troops. The theme represents a major departure from the Vietnam War protests, 
when the soldiers themselves were often the target of anti-war sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent meeting at a San Diego law school, for example, more than 100 
activists hotly debated whether to stage protests at the docks when Navy ships 
left for the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"You would be dividing my loyalties since my wife will be on one of those 
ships," said Mike Meyer, a 26-year-old San Diego student who left the Navy 
after four years of service. 
</P>
<P>
With an almost unanimous vote, the group decided that a dockside protest would 
be more damaging than helpful by alienating military families. Instead, they 
opted for a press conference at a separate location and a different time, 
vowing to come up with good visuals for television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Tools of the movement include petitions, letters to politicians and 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Activists plan fund raising, hone strategies for obtaining big-name stars, and 
calculate how to woo the media. So far, those efforts have met with limited 
success. Actor Ed Asner and singer Holly Near have signed on to participate in 
today's Los Angeles teach-in. 
</P>
<P>
The memory of Vietnam has enabled organizers to pull together groups in a 
relatively short time. In the Vietnam War era, many religious leaders waited a 
decade before they voiced their opposition. But shortly after Iraq invaded 
Kuwait, some -- from Catholics to Lutherans to Episcopalians -- began opposing 
the possible use of U.S. military force. 
</P>
<P>
"There is much more awareness now than there ever was at this stage in Vietnam 
because people have learned from the past," said Edna Bonacich, professor of 
sociology and ethnic studies at UC Riverside. "In Vietnam, we had the enemy 
'communist' who gave the war a lot of legitimacy. Now people are asking: 'What 
are we doing there? Are we fighting for oil, and it isn't even our oil? Would 
we invade if this was not oil territory, if Kuwait was producing potatoes?' " 
</P>
<P>
But, they acknowledge, there are important differences between the anti-war 
climate now and in the 1960s. Because body bags have not come home, this 
conflict is not yet one of life and death. Because there is no draft, anti-war 
sentiment has not ignited college students. 
</P>
<P>
To Bonacich's frustration, public opinion polls have a mixed message. According 
to a new Times Poll, 61% approve of Bush's actions, an increase from 54% in 
November -- but still lower than September's 78%. Asked what the U.S. should do 
once the hostages are free, 37% backed invading Iraq if it refuses to pull out 
of Kuwait. However, in a Newsweek poll a week ago, a majority of Americans -- 
56% -- supported military action. 
</P>
<P>
Disturbed by what she viewed as students' passivity, Bonacich helped form a 
small group of politically concerned students and teachers. This month, for the 
first time, the group orchestrated a rally of about 100 people on the small, 
conservative campus. Alarmed about the possibility of the draft's being 
reinstated, sophomore Mark Thayler joined the protest. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are 19, listening to the news and hearing the President try to sell 
the idea of war," Thayler said, "you realize, 'I am one of those lives he is 
talking about sending over there.' " 
</P>
<P>
For Pat Laru and many others, protest is the only action they can take to make 
them feel less powerless. 
</P>
<P>
Laru, a 54-year-old clerical supervisor with San Diego's probation department, 
can scarcely believe she is once again protesting for peace. Laru, who 
describes herself as an ardent feminist and a single mother, burned effigies of 
the governor during the anti-war movement in Cambridge, Mass., in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
When her son, Jeff, joined the Marine Corps two years ago, she figured it was 
the ultimate rebellion of a young man who grew up in a liberal home. She 
demanded he see violent Vietnam movies -- "Platoon," "Full Metal Jacket," 
"Apocalypse Now" -- but had no luck in dissuading him. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff, now 21, called two weeks ago and haltingly told her his unit was being 
shipped out to the Persian Gulf area. His words electrified her with fear. She 
said they discussed various ways he could avoid being deployed: start a barroom 
brawl, lie to his supervisor and say he was gay, or apply for 
conscientious-objector status. 
</P>
<P>
Laru advised her boy, "Save your skin," and when the call ended, she wept. Now 
she regrets that she had not forcefully prohibited her son from joining the 
Marines. She also regrets that she had not earned more money so she could have 
offered her son more options after he graduated from high school. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Laru has not slept well. She does not know when Jeff will call again or 
what he decided to do. She has terrible dreams. She wakes up crying, soaked in 
sweat, having dreamed that Jeff is lying dead on an airstrip in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"When I held him as an infant, I thought this was one baby who was not going to 
be machine-gun fodder," Laru said. "This is terror. This is a mother's 
nightmare."

ENVOYS BELIEVE IRAQ IS CAPABLE OF LONG HOLDOUT

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Food supplies in Iraq are probably adequate to carry the country to the spring 
harvest of wheat and barley, foreign diplomats say, while key industries can 
continue to operate for the foreseeable future using borrowed parts from 
broken-down installations. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews here during the past three days, half a dozen foreign observers 
agreed that the world trade embargo has not been in place long enough to bring 
Iraq's economy fully to its knees. The sanctions were imposed by the U.N. 
Security Council to try to force Iraq to end its occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than collapse all at once, the diplomats declared, Iraq's economy is 
slowly bleeding as farms and factories improvise to meet the immediate crisis. 
</P>
<P>
These emergency measures, including the cultivation of fallow land to boost the 
next harvest and the use of worn industrial parts, may adversely affect 
production in the long run, the observers say. 
</P>
<P>
"The sanctions have not been given enough time, that is certain," one Western 
European diplomat and economic expert said. "The country is on a war footing, 
and all efforts are directed at keeping things together week by week." 
</P>
<P>
There was no agreement among the diplomats here on when, or if, Iraqi leader 
Saddam Hussein would yield and retreat. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a race against the clock, except that no one knows when zero hour is 
reached," remarked a Scandinavian diplomat with long experience in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
From the American point of view, the day is too far off. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. military can't keep troops and equipment in the gulf for the time it 
might take," declared Joseph C. Wilson IV, chief of the American diplomatic 
mission here. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to experiences elsewhere, Wilson added: "I've seen many an African 
economy grind down without collapsing." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been able to stretch food supplies with a combination of tactics. 
Flour rationing went into effect soon after the embargo took hold four months 
ago. Economic hardship has also reduced public consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Persian Gulf crisis, Iraq imported about 70% of its food. Mixing 
substandard grain with better-quality stocks has expanded supplies somewhat. 
Homemakers are also substituting locally grown fruits and vegetables for bread 
in their diets. 
</P>
<P>
Rising prices on the black market for such staple foods as flour and sugar 
suggest that supplies are dwindling. Within a period of two days, the cost of 
flour on the black market increased by 30%, a shopper said. 
</P>
<P>
Smuggling and Iraq's sacking of occupied Kuwait have contributed to maintaining 
the Iraqi diet, at least in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Bags of flour, nuts, dried apricots and tea from neighboring Iran are on sale 
throughout the teeming Shurja market in central Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Goods from Kuwait make a capricious mixture on store shelves: Rita brand corn 
oil, Grecian olives, Cadbury English chocolates, Pepsi Cola, large cans of 
liquid Cheddar cheese bearing the Arby's fast-food label and even a candy 
called Slime Slurp. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for the items are high, and there are complaints that merchants are 
selling even locally produced, unrationed products at inflated prices. In the 
Kadamiya district the other day, a group of women shoppers shouted complaints 
that the price of local river fish had doubled in a day. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a risk for the government if discontent grows, although for now the 
situation is in hand," a Western European diplomat said. The diplomat reported 
that goods are being smuggled from Turkey into the north of the country and 
from Jordan into the west. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government is abetting the trade and may be using its reserves of 
gold to pay for clandestine imports. Iraqi troops were reported to have looted 
$3 billion to $4 billion worth of gold from the Kuwaiti treasury when they 
overran that country. 
</P>
<P>
To increase food supplies next year, the Hussein government ordered landowners 
to sow crops in idle plots or face confiscation of the land. In addition, 
fallow fields have been planted out of season to boost the next harvest. 
Disrupting the rest period for the land may reduce future yields, economic 
observers predicted. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the future for Iraq is now," an Asian diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to Iraq's industrial base is harder to assess because reporters and 
diplomats are not allowed to visit factories, power plants and farms. Iraq has 
put a premium on keeping defense industries, oil refineries and power plants 
operating, diplomats believe. 
</P>
<P>
If spare parts are out of stock, managers of critical industries have been 
ordered to scavenge them from other factories, even if it means closing them 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is going to let a power plant close for lack of a fuse if one can be 
grabbed from a rivet factory," an Eastern European diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everything can be replaced, and sticking with worn parts may eventually 
damage Iraq's industrial base, diplomats predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Imported fuel additives are in short supply, and the quality of gasoline and 
motor oil is deteriorating, threatening damage to industrial and automobile 
engines. The amount of chemical additives used to boost octane in gasoline has 
apparently been reduced, vehicle drivers say. 
</P>
<P>
"My car knocks like hell," the Scandinavian diplomat said, referring to an 
engine noise that generally signifies reduced octane. 
</P>
<P>
A shortage of parts is evident in private transport. Theft of parts from 
carelessly parked cars occurs often on Baghdad streets, leaving furious owners 
in search of replacements on the thriving black market. 
</P>
<P>
The army is having some difficulty finding spare parts for trucks and jeeps and 
has begun to dismantle unrepairable vehicles to keep others in the fleet 
running, diplomats note.

TRUCKING FIRM P-I-E TO CLOSE, SELL OFF ASSETS

<P>
Ailing P-I-E International announced Saturday that it will shut down the 
nationwide trucking corporation within three weeks and begin liquidating 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George L. Proctor approved the plan in a brief hearing 
after P-I-E's attorney said a weak economy and less-than-projected revenues 
over the last five weeks made the outlook bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no light at the end of the tunnel," attorney Steve Busey said. "The 
company determined there was no real prospect of a successful reorganization." 
</P>
<P>
P-I-E has been struggling since it and parent Olympia Holding Corp. filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization two months ago, listing debts of $237 
million and assets of $169 million. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the filing, P-I-E operated 230 terminals and employed 3,500 workers, 
800 of them at the company's Jacksonville base. 
</P>
<P>
After two months of scaling down -- with the elimination of 1,500 jobs and 69 
terminals Friday -- P-I-E now employs about 2,000 people and operates about 100 
terminals. Cuts were expected to continue through P-I-E's final weeks, Busey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Proctor last month granted P-I-E the operating funds to stay in business 
through Saturday, but he said the company would have to demonstrate benefits 
for the company and its creditors to get any more money. 
</P>
<P>
Under the court-approved liquidation plan, the company would continue to 
operate under Chapter 11 during the two to three weeks it takes to deliver the 
remaining freight in its warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
Then a court-appointed trustee, scheduled to be named by Proctor Dec. 29, will 
supervise the liquidation of the company's assets. 
</P>
<P>
The liquidation plan comes after weeks of pressure from anxious creditors, 
including Fidelcor Business Credit Corp. P-I-E owes Fidelcor $39 million.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid increasingly strident opposition by religious conservatives to American 
influences in the kingdom, there is a growing sense within Saudi Arabia that, 
whether the crisis in the Persian Gulf is resolved by peace or by war, the 
Saudis cannot afford to wait much longer. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia until now has adamantly opposed a negotiated solution to the 
crisis. But officials with the multinational alliance here are growing 
increasingly concerned that mounting pressure on the monarchy from religious 
activists could force the Saudis -- in the event of a continued stalemate -- to 
seek a separate peace with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they clearly prefer a peaceful outcome. They doubt it will happen. But 
the one thing they have to have happen is to get it over," one senior Western 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
"By Jan. 15, they will need to know definitely when and how we propose to 
accomplish the objectives that we started out with in August," he said. Jan. 
15, 1991, is the deadline that the U.N. Security Council has set for Iraq to 
withdraw from Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic holy month of Ramadan in March, which is followed by an annual 
pilgrimage, has become "a kind of control date," the Western official added. 
"If this crisis has not taken some sort of decisive turn by then, the tensions 
become almost insupportable." 
</P>
<P>
But Saudi Arabia has rebuffed the latest efforts to negotiate an Arab 
resolution to the crisis. It applauds, in principle, attempts to reach a 
peaceful settlement, but it insists that any resolution comply with the U.N. 
demands for a complete Iraqi pullout and restoration of Kuwait's ruling family. 
</P>
<P>
Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid, fresh from contacts in Jordan and Iraq, 
canceled a planned trip to Saudi Arabia when the kingdom made it clear it has 
no intention at present of agreeing to a meeting between King Fahd and Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Such a meeting "is a waste of time. It will not happen," one Saudi official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Western officials are becoming increasingly concerned that 
Saudi Arabia, alarmed at the increasing stridence of religious conservatives 
opposed to the U.S. military presence and mindful of its own need to eventually 
make amends with its Arab neighbors, will "exit to the bazaar" and cut its own 
deal if it perceives the United States is not prepared to act. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to live in this region; long after we go away, they will still be 
here," one senior Western diplomat said. "If we cannot contribute to their 
national security, and in fact end up detracting from it by hatching plans to 
stay here, then they will start pressing a resolution on their own." 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of the Security Council's Jan. 15 deadline passing quietly with no 
resolution to the crisis in sight and no clear U.S. mandate for military action 
looms as a chilling scenario for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"The Saudis are totally reluctant to confront that possibility," said one 
Western official, "as indeed we are." 
</P>
<P>
What kinds of terms the Saudis might seek in any negotiated settlement are not 
clear. The kingdom in recent weeks has been sending out subtle signals that it 
would not object to a scenario under which Iraq withdraws unconditionally from 
Kuwait and then negotiates, with Saudi Arabia's blessing, for control of the 
two Persian Gulf islands and the oil field on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border that 
Iraq regards as its rightful property. 
</P>
<P>
"When there is no war, when there is no tension, there is nothing wrong with a 
compromise on territory among Arab countries," one Saudi official said. "There 
is no dishonor in that. We have done it before." 
</P>
<P>
However, many Saudi officials still believe that decisive military action may 
be the only way to resolve the crisis. And they are increasingly nervous about 
what they perceive as a lack of will within the United States and on the part 
of many Saudi civilians to pursue such action. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps if you take the majority of Saudis, the majority of Saudis would say 
they prefer to negotiate because they are foolish enough to think it can be 
solved without blood, without casualties," said one official with close ties to 
the Saudi Defense Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep talking about how many tanks Saddam has," he said. "Don't worry 
about tanks. You don't need tanks. What you need is the head of the snake. You 
hit it and wait. If it doesn't die, you hit it again." 
</P>
<P>
Fueling much of the concern for a quick settlement in Saudi Arabia is a rash of 
increasingly violent confrontations between religious conservatives and 
liberal, Western-influenced Saudis. Most Saudi officials believe these 
conflicts are tied to the religious Establishment's belief that the U.S. troop 
presence is contributing to a disturbing secularization in the normally 
conservative Muslim kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a group of mutawain, or religious police, armed with firearms, axes 
and clubs, stormed into the home of a French businessman in Riyadh during a 
rowdy party, smashed furniture and attacked several party-goers, injuring 12. 
</P>
<P>
All 46 people at the party, including several Americans, French and Britons, 
were arrested. The authorities in Riyadh intervened and released the 
party-goers the next morning and reportedly disciplined the mutawain involved. 
But the American and British embassies have filed protests. 
</P>
<P>
Then, only two weeks ago, the mutawain in Jidda broke into a party hosted by a 
prominent perfume distributor, a man with close connections with King Fahd, and 
arrested him. He was sentenced by a religious court to two years in prison for 
violating the kingdom's laws against alcohol and social contact between 
unmarried men and women, according to Saudi sources in Riyadh. 
</P>
<P>
The two incidents have provoked alarm in both the Saudi and foreign communities 
here. Although laws against alcohol and intersex mingling are strictly enforced 
in public, people since the late 1950s have been largely free to do as they 
like within their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock to liberal Saudis, who believed that what happened behind the 
walls of their house was their business, not the business of the religious 
police," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent incident involved a group of mutawain in Riyadh who went to a 
supermarket frequented by Westerners and attempted to prevent single men from 
entering the market while women were inside. A group of Saudi men objected, a 
fistfight broke out, and the mutawain chased the men in their car and ran into 
a light pole, according to Saudi sources.

Accusing President Bush of lying, Iraq said there is no longer any chance that 
its foreign minister will meet with Bush on Monday as proposed, and insisted 
that it alone would set the date for any talks in Baghdad. Washington has 
rejected an Iraqi proposal for talks in Baghdad on Jan. 12, only three days 
before the U.N. Security Council deadline for withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein told a Muslim delegation that if U.S.-Iraqi 
talks are ever held, the two sides should take up the Palestinian issue before 
addressing Iraq's takeover of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of the United States and Iraq to agree on dates for talks has moved 
the region closer to war, according to a group of Democratic senators touring 
U.S. troop positions in Saudi Arabia.

Noting that Operation Desert Shield is expected to cost $37 billion next year, 
House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and Rep. Charles E. Schumer 
(D-N.Y.) complained that America's allies are not contributing their fair 
share. The key allies -- Japan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, 
Germany and South Korea -- have pledged only $10.6 billion, or 29% of the 
estimated cost, the lawmakers said.

OIL COMPANY IS HEART OF THE CONFRONTATION; 
</P>
<P>
SAUDI ARABIA: ARAMCO IS THE ECONOMIC LIFELINE THAT AMERICA, IN EFFECT, HAS COME 
TO DEFEND. 
</P>

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In many ways, the focal point of the Persian Gulf confrontation is not a 
country or a principle, but a company -- Saudi Aramco. It is the economic 
lifeline represented by Aramco, in essence, that America has come to defend 
with the largest buildup of forces assembled since Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Aramco, headquartered in Dhahran, produces 96% of Saudi Arabia's oil and 
controls one-quarter of the world's known oil reserves. It employs the biggest 
community of Americans -- about 4,700 -- in the Middle East. Its economic and 
political power dominates Saudi Arabia and the neighboring gulf sheikdoms and 
reaches to the farthest corners of the globe. When people here refer to The 
Company, they mean Saudi Aramco. 
</P>
<P>
For the Americans at Aramco (short for Arab American Oil Co.), the gulf crisis 
threatens a lifestyle of unusual comforts and financial rewards, yet they, 
almost more than anyone, seem largely unconcerned about the potential dangers. 
Of the hundreds of expatriates who have resigned from the company since Iraq 
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, only about 70 have been Americans. For those who 
remain, life goes on much as before, behind compound walls that convey a sense 
of safety and isolation from the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Three old friends -- all wives of Aramco oilmen -- sat at the company-owned 
Rolling Hills Country Club the other day talking about the crisis with two 
visiting journalists. Their table overlooked a 27-hole sand golf course. The 
cars in the parking lot outside were American. The lawns surrounding nearby 
ranch-style homes on Lilac Avenue and Prairie View Circle were green and 
trimmed with flowers. The 640-seat cinema was advertising a first-run feature. 
It was as though a Houston suburb had been plopped down in the middle of the 
Arabian desert. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a lot of flak when I came back after vacation in the States," said 
Paula Reimer of Boston, who has lived here 11 years. "Friends said, 'Paula, if 
you're stupid enough to go back, at least leave your daughter behind.' But I'm 
not nervous. I honestly can't understand what people are talking about when 
they say life here will never be the same again." 
</P>
<P>
"Back in Calgary, we were both working, and we weren't living high off the hog, 
and at the end of the month, there was nothing left," said Chris Haltiner, the 
wife of an Aramco geophysicist. "Here, with one of us working, we're much, much 
better off, and life's better. I'd hate to go back and have to start all over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
"If we moved back, there would be a lot of pressures, like bills, having to buy 
a house, that we don't have here," added Lauri Zoll of Seattle. "When my kids, 
who are in school back home, get concerned about us being here, I have to 
remind them, 'Remember, the news is exaggerated.' " 
</P>
<P>
There are, nonetheless, nearly a million potential combatants who have brought 
the world's most devastating weapons to within 200 miles of Aramco's doorstep. 
The allied forces are quite literally stationed atop the principal energy 
reserves of Asia, Europe and North America. Within the theater of operations 
are the planet's largest oil field, known as Ghawar, and the largest offshore 
field, Safaniya, just 35 miles from Kuwait. Ras Tanura is the largest oil port 
and oil refinery in the Middle East; the oil complex at Jubail is the most 
expensive industrial project ever undertaken by man. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 1, Saudi Arabia was producing 5.3 million barrels of oil each day, with 
plans of gradually increasing output until it reached 10 million barrels by the 
turn of the century. In response to the invasion, however, the Saudis opted to 
open the tap as quickly as possible. Saudi production recently topped 8 million 
barrels a day, within striking distance of the 9.6 million produced at the 
height of the oil boom in 1980. "They surprised everyone, including themselves, 
by getting to 8 million," said one petroleum analyst. 
</P>
<P>
In order to stabilize prices, the Saudis now want to hit 10 million barrels by 
the mid-1990s. As a result, Aramco is recruiting more workers and letting new 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Aramco, still the most prestigious place for young Saudis to gain employment, 
is the descendant of the kingdom's first petroleum consortium. Commercial oil 
was discovered in the Eastern Province in 1938 when a well called Damman No. 7 
broke loose after almost everyone except Max Steineke, an American geologist 
with Standard Oil Co. of California, which later became Chevron, had given up 
on ever finding anything in Saudi Arabia but heat and flies. Socal and three 
other U.S. oil companies eventually formed Aramco. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days, Aramco operated as a quasi-government run by Americans. The 
first concession the Americans signed with Saudi Arabia, in 1933 before the 
Damman strike, paid the sheik of Jidda $1 per ton of produced oil; crude was 
then selling in the United States for 50 cents a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
By 1951, Aramco was paying more in taxes to the U.S. government than it was to 
Saudi Arabia for royalties. In 1974, the Saudis began a 15-year program to buy 
out Aramco's American owners, and the company is now 100% Saudi owned. Among 
its holdings are 50% of Texaco and 1,100 gas stations in the United States and 
Europe. Its work force numbers 45,000 and includes 50 nationalities. 
</P>
<P>
Since the earliest days, foreigners at Aramco have enjoyed special privileges 
and excellent benefits. Women can work and drive within the compound, and 
swimming pools are not sexually segregated. Employees receive 40 days of 
vacation a year, a 25% hardship bonus for working in the kingdom and a generous 
education subsidy if their children go to high school abroad. Company subsidies 
enable each child to take three free trips a year back to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Americans at Aramco are second- and third-generation employees, 
following in the footsteps of their fathers and grandfathers. Most have a 
loyalty to the company and -- although few can speak Arabic even after years 
here -- a deep respect for Saudi Arabia. They have become true expatriates, at 
home in an alien culture, clinging to what is American and living by the rules 
of Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'Why should we help Saudi Arabia? They're not a democracy,' " said 
Beverly Pepperdine, who with her husband lived here for five years in the '50s 
and returned for keeps in 1977. "Well, the fact is, Saudi Arabia has benefited 
greatly from this government. When we first got here, the Saudis were living in 
shacks in the desert. Now they've got houses. They've got education, excellent 
health care. They're bilingual. Free enterprise is flourishing. I don't see how 
anyone can say this government hasn't been good for the country."

RIOTING ENDS IN ALBANIA WITH MILITARY TAKING CONTROL

TIRANA, Albania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Security forces Saturday maintained control of towns hit by anti-government 
rioting, and Albania's first independent political party sought permission from 
the Marxist regime to try to avert new unrest, party leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of fresh violence in the small Balkan nation. 
</P>
<P>
States of emergency remained in effect in at least five towns, and movement 
into and out of the towns was prohibited by the military and police, police 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"According to our activists in those areas, the situation is calm," said Gramoz 
Pashko, an economics professor at Tirana's Enver Hoxha University and a key 
organizer of the new Democratic Party, which has condemned the unrest. 
</P>
<P>
He said party leaders Friday night requested a dialogue with the regime of 
President Ramiz Alia "on how to solve the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Among other proposals, the party wants to send members to trouble spots to 
persuade residents to support a peaceful transition to democracy after 45 years 
of Stalinist-style police rule, Pashko said. 
</P>
<P>
Party leaders said they believe the rioting was the result of pent-up 
frustration and disenchantment with Albania's severe economic problems and 
decades of harsh Marxist rule. 
</P>
<P>
Alia agreed Monday -- after three days of student protests -- to permit 
independent parties in a gradual loosening of the Communist bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Observers said protesters may have seen the government's decision to allow 
individual parties as a signal it would tolerate opposition. The formation 
Tuesday of the Democratic Party, which has yet to be legally recognized by the 
regime, apparently provided the spark for the disturbances.

World chess champion Gary Kasparov pushed challenger Anatoly Karpov to the 
brink of elimination from their title match Saturday with a flashy 41-move win 
in the 20th game. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov now leads the 24-game series 11-9 with four wins, two losses and 14 
draws. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov, playing white, combined speed and power to unleash a ferocious attack 
on the black king, which eventually caused his challenger huge material losses. 
</P>
<P>
Karpov was forced to defend a very risky position with only seconds separating 
him from loss by forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
The champion manipulated the game in his best crowd-pleasing style, sacrificing 
assets to strip his opponent of defenders, then invading to recoup his 
investment, with interest. 
</P>
<P>
The players exchanged a firm handshake at the end of the game as applause 
erupted from a capacity crowd of about 1,000 in Lyon's Palais de Congres. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their long-running rivalry and the drama of the day's clash, the 
players remained onstage for several minutes, discussing the intricacies of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Experts gave Karpov credit for taking chances to provoke a crisis; he had badly 
needed an equalizing win. 
</P>
<P>
Karpov's two-point deficit is made even more daunting by the clause in the 
competition rules that will allow Kasparov to keep his crown in the event of a 
12-12 tie.

Here are the moves of the game:

VOTE UPSETS PLAN TO CUT NICARAGUA ARMY; 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA: LAWMAKERS DEFY PRESIDENT BY APPROVING DEEPER BUDGET REDUCTIONS 
THAN THOSE NEGOTIATED WITH THE SANDINISTA-LED MILITARY. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A carefully negotiated plan to reduce the Sandinista-led army in Nicaragua was 
upset Saturday after the country's National Assembly cut nearly $20 million 
from a slimmed-down defense budget submitted by President Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's entire National Opposition Union bloc, a majority in the assembly, 
defied the president by voting late Friday to lower defense spending from $166 
million in 1990 to $58.8 million in 1991, less than 12% of next year's 
$495-million national budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan leader, who had proposed spending $78.6 million for defense, 
announced Saturday that she will veto the bill. The army, which had accepted 
her cuts, warned that it "will not permit" further reduction of its manpower. 
</P>
<P>
"This (veto) doesn't mean I am against disarmament, but the reduction of the 
military has to be gradual," said Chamorro, who arrived here and began meeting 
with the civilian presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras 
and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day talks will focus on stalled peace negotiations in El Salvador, 
where leftist guerrillas escalated their attacks last month, and on steps to 
integrate Central America's economies. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua is heading an effort, endorsed at a summit in June, to reduce armies 
throughout the region. Since Chamorro took office April 25, Nicaragua's army, 
once the region's largest, has been cut from 80,000 to 28,400 members, making 
it smaller than those in El Salvador and Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
Those two armies have resisted cuts in their ranks. Last month, Honduran 
officers sacked the chief of their armed forces for yielding to a 10% reduction 
in defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
Each cutback in Nicaragua has been negotiated with Sandinista Gen. Humberto 
Ortega, the army commander, since Chamorro's election ended a decade of 
Sandinista rule and eight years of war between the army and the U.S.-backed 
Contras. Ortega is retiring 5,000 of his 14,000 officers on the basis of 
Chamorro's budget. 
</P>
<P>
The sharper cuts approved by the assembly, in a 52-39 vote, signaled a revolt 
in Chamorro's 14-party coalition against continued Sandinista control of the 
military. Sandinista lawmakers, voting against it, warned that the cuts would 
destabilize the country by making the army too weak to control civil disorders. 
An army statement Saturday said this would "plunge Nicaragua into chaos and 
bloodshed more terrible and painful than (conflicts) in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Lacayo, the president's chief adviser, said: "Far from contributing to 
an additional reduction (of the army), this could paralyze, abort or reverse 
the process and threaten national security." 
</P>
<P>
If the assembly overrides Chamorro's veto, Lacayo said, virtually all the 
remaining officers would have to go, as salaries make up 60% of the army 
budget. This would be "intolerable," he said. "It would practically put an end 
to the army." 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua still has a large fleet of Soviet-supplied combat helicopters. 
Officials gathered for the summit in this Pacific Coast resort were stunned to 
see two of them land here, ferrying the presidents one by one from the airport 
in San Jose, Costa Rica's inland capital. Costa Rica, which abolished its army 
in 1948, borrowed the choppers from Nicaragua's air force.

5 DIE, 127 HURT AS WORST RIOTS IN 7 YEARS SWEEP MOROCCO CITY

Thousands of rioters burned down a hotel and attacked vehicles, shops and banks 
in the ancient city of Fez in Morocco's worst violence in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
At least five people were killed and 127 were injured in the rioting, which 
flared during a one-day general strike Friday and continued Saturday, the 
official news agency MAP reported. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 demonstrators, some armed with chains, iron bars and knives, 
rampaged through the narrow alleys of the old walled city of Fez -- one of 
North Africa's most popular tourist centers -- and into the modern part of the 
town, burning and looting. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, protesters set fire to a police station and several vehicles in 
Fez, but order was restored by nightfall, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Trade union sources said there were also disturbances in the northern towns of 
Tangier, Kenitra and Sidi Slimane. 
</P>
<P>
It was the worst street violence in Morocco since January, 1984, when more than 
100 people died in bread riots. 
</P>
<P>
MAP said several hotels in Fez, 90 miles east of Rabat, were set ablaze, but 
there were no casualties among staff or guests. Rescue teams plucked some from 
the flames. 
</P>
<P>
One hotel, the Merinides, a 200-room landmark on a hill overlooking the old 
city, was burned down. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's strike was called by Morocco's two trade union federations. The unions 
are demanding an increase in wages from a minimum of $130 to $260 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The government denied reports from a trade union spokesman that 20 to 30 people 
were killed when security forces and troops in armored vehicles fired on 
demonstrators Friday. 
</P>
<P>
MAP said troops used tear gas and fired warning shots to break up the riots, 
which erupted when students attacked buses driven by soldiers replacing 
striking drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 110 looters, including a group carrying a safe containing 
$75,000.

DRILLING PLATFORM IGNITES, TANK EXPLODES IN SEA OFF MASSACHUSETTS

An offshore drilling platform caught fire, and a fuel tank aboard exploded 
Saturday, and authorities said they would have to let the blaze burn itself 
out. 
</P>
<P>
The initial fire broke out about 4:15 a.m., Coast Guard Petty Officer Elizabeth 
Brannan said. 
</P>
<P>
About four hours later, a fuel tank on board the platform exploded, forcing two 
groups of firefighters off the deck. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters were not hurt, and neither were the two workers on the 
platform at the time the original fire broke out, Brannan said. There was no 
evidence that any of the fuel spilled into the ocean, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The platform, about two miles off the Gloucester coast north of Boston, is used 
to drill pipelines to dispose of sewage at sea. 
</P>
<P>
After the explosion, members of the Coast Guard and firefighters tried battling 
the blaze from the water before deciding to let it burn out, Brannan said. 
Rainstorms were helping to dampen the fire, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, they're just standing off and waiting for the fire to go out on its 
own," Brannan said. 
</P>
<P>
There are several other fuel tanks on the platform, but Brannan said there was 
little chance that any of those tanks would explode. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the platform, Maitland Bros. of Louisiana, told authorities they 
would assume responsibility for the fire and have hired a company involved in 
the cleanup of Boston Harbor, Brannan said. 
</P>
<P>
Four Coast Guard cutters, a fireboat from the Massachusetts Port Authority and 
several smaller boats -- all equipped with firefighting equipment -- were 
called to fight the blaze.

FEEDING TUBE IS REMOVED FROM RIGHT-TO-DIE PATIENT

A woman who was brain-damaged in a 1983 automobile accident was removed from 
her feeding tube Saturday, and doctors predicted that she will die within two 
weeks, a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Cruzan, 33, was taken off the nutrition apparatus one day after an order 
by Jasper County Probate Judge Charles E. Teel Jr. The decision ended a 
landmark right-to-die case that reached the Supreme Court in June. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Shoun, director of public relations for the Missouri Rehabilitation 
Center, indicated that the surgically implanted tube had been removed from 
their patient, who has lingered in a vegetative state since the wreck on Jan. 
11, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rehabilitation Center complied with the wishes of the Cruzan family and 
the court order late yesterday (Friday) afternoon," Shoun said. 
</P>
<P>
Center director Donald Lamkins said that Cruzan would likely die within 10 to 
14 days after removal of the tube. 
</P>
<P>
Cruzan's parents, who said they plan to stay by their daughter's side until she 
dies, have expressed relief that their ordeal was near an end. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope very much . . . just to hold her hand when she goes across. That's the 
way I feel. She's my kid," said her father, Joe. 
</P>
<P>
Cruzan's parents have been pursuing legal permission for three years to allow 
their daughter to die. The key move came this fall when the family found 
friends of their daughter who testified at a new hearing before Teel. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling Friday, Teel said the new "clear and convincing evidence" showed 
that Cruzan's own intent, "if mentally able, would be to terminate her 
nutrition and hydration" rather than live by artificial means. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group Missouri Citizens for Life, which also actively opposes 
abortion, said they would ask Gov. John Ashcroft and the state attorney general 
to seek a stay of the judge's order pending a new appeal. State authorities, 
however, said they would abide by Teel's latest decision. 
</P>
<P>
Cruzan has been in a persistent vegetative state since suffering severe brain 
damage in the automobile accident. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a ruling by the Missouri Supreme Court 
that the woman's family failed to present "clear and convincing" evidence in 
the absence of a written statement that Cruzan had expressed the desire to die 
rather than live in a vegetative state. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cruzan's parents again asked Teel to allow them to remove the tube, 
citing the new testimony from friends of their daughter who did not appear at 
the original hearing.

Economic aftershocks of the collapse of the Cypress freeway in the Oct. 17, 
1989, Loma Prieta earthquake are still being felt, according to a report to be 
issued Monday by transportation and economic experts. The report calculates the 
closure of the 1 1/2-mile freeway, which linked downtown Oakland with the San 
Francisco Bay Bridge, has cost $22.5 million to date in added travel times for 
motorists, higher vehicle operating costs and delays in shipments of products. 
"The devastation caused by the Loma Prieta earthquake has taught us some hard 
lessons -- one of them being that investment in transportation infrastructure 
is a critical element in any strategy to sustain economic growth in the 
region," said Mike McGill, executive director of the Bay Area Forum, which will 
issue the report along with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.

A Tuolumne County judge sentenced a man to 55 years in prison for the 
kidnaping, rape and sexual assault of a 13-year-old Jamestown girl. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge James Hardin refused Friday to lighten the sentence for 
Dale Drew Crumpton despite testimony that he was suffering from alcoholic 
blackouts and was not responsible for his actions. Prosecutors used DNA tests 
to prove Crumpton was guilty of the October, 1989, kidnaping and rape. He was 
found guilty on eight counts of kidnap, rape and sexual assault.

OVERCROWDING AND AGE BURDEN FACILITY

<TEXT>
<P>
Full-time burglar and narcotics dealer Stephen Berkley can remember the good 
old days, way back in 1963, when the Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail 
first opened and a crook could almost see his reflection in cement floors so 
new that they shined. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at these scuff marks," said Berkley, 49. "Look at all these people. This 
place sure ain't what it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
A 1-million-square-foot hunk of concrete sandwiched between the paved banks of 
the Los Angeles River and the rusting warehouses of lower Chinatown, the jail, 
or "CJ" as it is known, is a metaphor for the plight of criminal justice in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Aging and overcrowded, it and other county jail facilities also are the damper 
on the local criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
While Los Angeles County's jail system is the largest in the nation, there 
simply is not enough space. Overcrowding has forced judges, prosecutors and 
police officers to juggle priorities that largely determine who should go to 
jail and how long they should remain. 
</P>
<P>
Built for no more than 5,276 inmates, the Men's Central Jail today houses 
nearly 6,800. Inmates line up for meals, showers and sick call. 
</P>
<P>
"Take it now . . . take it now," a jail nurse drones as she hands Tylenol 
capsules and paper cups of water to one cold-suffering inmate after another. 
"Take it now." 
</P>
<P>
Like the men they guard, deputies assigned to the jail have few kind words to 
say about conditions that were once state-of-the-art. 
</P>
<P>
"A jail, in my opinion, should sparkle," said Sheriff's Capt. Lee Davenport, 
who runs the jail's Inmate Reception Center. "We don't sparkle. Just keeping 
our heads above water is a major task." 
</P>
<P>
It is through the conveyor-like reception center that all male inmates enter 
incarceration (females are processed in East Los Angeles at the women's Sybil 
Brand Institute). 
</P>
<P>
A sign near the entrance advises officers to "Leave all knives, saps and ammo 
with control deputy." As the two steel doors open and clang shut, incoming 
arrestees find seats on wooden benches until called by the next available 
filing clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Separated by a glass window, a clerk asks each arrestee 52 questions, typing 
the answers into a computer -- his name, address, birth date, color of eyes, 
observable physical oddities, whether he has venereal disease. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Those picked up on minor charges usually are released within minutes. To thin 
the jail population, the sheriff will not hold anyone arrested on a misdemeanor 
if his bail is less than $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
Those who remain are frisked by deputies, ordered to strip and shower, issued a 
towel and jail clothing, then given a meat and cheese sandwich and Kool-Aid. 
They are fingerprinted, photographed, X-rayed for tuberculosis and seated in 
front of a television monitor to watch a 45-minute videotape on jail routine. 
Then they are ushered into the general population. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the jail, there is a dreary, institutional cast that cannot be masked by 
colorful murals of western vistas and wagon trains painted by inmates. Some 
walls are so thick with layers of green paint that they flex at the push of a 
fingertip. 
</P>
<P>
A chill wind literally howls through many corridors, thanks to an imbalanced 
and antiquated air-conditioning system that works all too well in some areas 
and not at all in others, deputies and inmates say. 
</P>
<P>
For many repeat offenders like Stephen Berkley, the discomforts and 
inconveniences of jail life are nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
"Three hundred times," he laughed when asked how often he had been jailed 
before. "This is my job." His most recent arrest came after he broke into a 
warehouse filled with suede jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Not only has the jail itself gone downhill, Berkley observed, but so have the 
people in it. Many are gang members bent on killing each other and anyone who 
stands between them. 
</P>
<P>
"I got two nephews in here right now, one's a Blood; the other's a Crip," he 
said. "They're all crazy, crazy. You're dealing with a new breed now. These 
kids got no respect for the law."

<P>
A DRUNKEN FIGHT, A KILLING -- AND 18 MONTHS IN PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Aguilar and William Rowe Jr., panhandlers both, were drinking together on 
Feb. 22, outside a liquor store on Sunset Boulevard, when they began to argue. 
Shoving soon escalated to blows. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar, 32, the drunker and weaker of the two, got the worst of it and fell to 
the sidewalk. Rowe, 38, savagely and repeatedly kicked him about the head and 
stomach, then walked away as if nothing had happened. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses called for an ambulance and Aguilar was taken to UCLA Medical Center 
where he died four weeks later. An autopsy showed he was suffering from liver 
disease, acute kidney failure and blood poisoning. The cause of death was 
listed as blows to the head and abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives eventually arrested Rowe, and he was charged with murder. Rowe had 
served time before, for burglary and grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe told Detective Ernie Basset that he did not intend to kill Aguilar and was 
only defending himself, but lost control. 
</P>
<P>
Rowe pleaded not guilty. On June 28, records show, he changed his plea after 
the murder charge was reduced to involuntary manslaughter, punishable by two, 
three or four years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Clarence E. (Red) Stromwell then sentenced Rowe to a 
three-year term. With various time credits, he will serve less than 18 months 
for taking another man's life. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Size said the sentence was a just one. He said he 
negotiated a plea because he feared a jury might not believe that Rowe had 
acted with malice or that the beating actually had caused Aguilar's death, 
given his poor health. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way we could have proved murder in this case," the prosecutor 
said.

Pregnant with her seventh child, Leanne Dees answered a classified ad in an 
Arkansas newspaper and, according to a Los Angeles woman, entered into a 
non-binding agreement to let her adopt the child. 
</P>
<P>
The excited adoptive mother-to-be, Debbie Freeman, brought Dees and her 
husband, Frankie, and their 1-year-old daughter to Van Nuys and paid $9,400 to 
support them for six months in a furnished apartment, she said. She said she 
took them shopping for food and clothes on Sundays and accompanied Leanne Dees 
on every visit to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
But a month shy of the baby's due date, Freeman said, her hopes for adopting 
the child fell apart when she discovered that the Deeses were quietly 
negotiating for financial support with other people hoping to adopt the same 
child. When confronted with the accusation, the Deeses promptly cleared out of 
the apartment, Freeman and police said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were as sincere as can be," a dejected Freeman said last week. "I 
basically had a family to support for several months and then they 
disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police are investigating the incident and trying to determine if 
other would-be adoptive parents gave the Deeses financial support in hopes that 
the newborn would be theirs. Police said they have uncovered a web of broken 
promises in which many people hoping to adopt a child have been misled 
emotionally, if not financially, by the Deeses. 
</P>
<P>
But police said there are few laws that specifically focus on adoption issues 
such as these. The Deeses have not been charged with any crime, and police said 
they may only face a misdemeanor violation of accepting money under false 
pretenses. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the baby boy Debbie Freeman thought would be hers was born Dec. 7 in 
Las Vegas as yet another couple hoping to adopt the child waited in the 
delivery room, according to the doctor who delivered the baby. But the Deeses, 
who police said have given up five previous babies for adoption, did not turn 
the child over to them either. The Deeses' exact whereabouts are not known. 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with the case say the Freeman/Dees case is a rare example of 
what can go wrong in the world of private adoption. 
</P>
<P>
In California, private adoption is regulated by the state Department of Social 
Services and local children's services authorities. According to local 
attorneys who specialize in adoption cases, about 90% of adoptions in the state 
are handled privately. The attorneys say it has become the predominant method 
of adoption because it is faster than adoption through public agencies and 
allows adoptive parents and birth parents more freedom in choosing each other. 
</P>
<P>
Although adoptive parents cannot pay to receive a child, it is legal to provide 
birth parents with financial support -- considered an act of charity -- in the 
form of living, travel, legal and medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
It is illegal in California to use newspaper advertising to seek or give up a 
baby for adoption. So residents of the state seeking to privately adopt 
children routinely advertise in newspapers in 36 other states where it is 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
It was into this process that Freeman, 39, a single West Los Angeles 
psychotherapist, stepped earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said she placed ads seeking a child to adopt in several newspapers 
across the country, including the Jonesboro Sun in Arkansas. About two weeks 
later, she said she received a call from Leanne Dees, who said she was pregnant 
and willing to give up the child. Dees, 27, her 37-year-old husband and their 
1-year-old daughter, who suffers from Downs syndrome, were in Las Vegas and had 
been told of the Jonesboro ad by relatives, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
After Freeman interviewed the Deeses in June and found them acceptable as birth 
parents, she brought them to Van Nuys, and the couple signed a letter of intent 
under which Freeman would be allowed to adopt the unborn child. The agreement 
was non-binding as required by law, meaning that the birth parents could back 
out at any time. 
</P>
<P>
Adoption attorneys say that was a risk Freeman and all adoptive parents have to 
take to get a child. They say that is why adoptive parents and their attorneys 
must carefully screen potential birth parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Screening for persons whose motives are not pure is essential," said Lynne 
Francis Mann, an attorney who did not handle the Freeman case. "There is so 
little protection for adopting parents. But there is a lot of protection for 
birth parents." 
</P>
<P>
But in screening the Deeses, Freeman and her attorney, Randi G. Barrow, did not 
come across anything that dissuaded them from pursuing the agreement. However, 
some warning signs about the couple -- passed among other attorneys in the 
adoption field -- never reached them. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Michaelman, an attorney in Pearl River, N.Y., who specializes in 
adoptions, said the Deeses are known among many adoption attorneys in the East 
for answering adoption ads but not following through with promises. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been telling people this is a bad-news couple," Michaelman said of the 
Deeses. "They have been traveling all over the country. They call people and 
ask them to wire money and then they disappear." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said she did not suspect the couple of any deception until Nov. 5, when 
Barrow got a call from Mann. Mann reported that she represented a couple 
looking to adopt a child and that they had been contacted by the Deeses about 
adopting Leanne's child. 
</P>
<P>
"The word leaked out," Freeman said. "Randi called the Deeses up and said, 
'What's going on?' They hung up on her. I went to the apartment. The security 
guard let me in and they had vanished. They had cleared out in less than two 
hours. I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
But the Deeses left behind a briefcase that contained a notebook with 11 names 
and phone numbers written in it, Freeman said. By calling the numbers, Freeman 
said, she discovered that they all belonged to people who were seeking to adopt 
babies and had placed ads in Arkansas newspapers. Freeman said the people she 
contacted all said they had begun to negotiate with the Deeses to give them 
financial aid. One Syracuse, N.Y., couple had already sent $200 to the couple 
for bus fare to New York. 
</P>
<P>
"Each one had been solicited money to begin adoption procedures," Freeman said. 
"You know, 'We need a place to live, can you send us some money, can you fly 
us?' It became very clear what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman called police and turned over the notebook. Although she recognized 
that the Deeses had the right to back out of the agreement, Freeman claimed 
that the record the couple had made of contacting other adoptive parents and 
taking money from at least one couple showed their intent to take Freeman's 
financial support but not turn over the child after its birth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they ever intended to give me the baby," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Detective Mel Arnold said he retraced Freeman's steps and confirmed what 
she had found, including that a New York couple had sent the Deeses $200 for 
bus fare. "Most of these people really thought they were going to get the 
baby," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said he received a letter from one woman who gave no money to the Deeses 
but believed that the child Leanne was carrying would be hers to adopt. The 
woman, whom Arnold did not identify, was familiar with Freeman's plight and 
offered her condolences. 
</P>
<P>
"Please express to Debbie that she is in my prayers," the woman wrote. "I've 
waited a long time and it is still like a dream. Debbie's child is out there in 
the world somewhere. Don't give up." 
</P>
<P>
Although the disappointment of potential parents such as Freeman is traumatic, 
Arnold said that because the Deeses had a non-binding agreement, their actions 
may only be a minor violation. 
</P>
<P>
State law makes it a misdemeanor to receive financial considerations for an 
adoption agreement without the intent to honor it. But Diane Michaelson, 
chairwoman of the Academy of California Adoption Attorneys, said that as of 
Jan. 1, the law will be strengthened to make it a felony to abrogate an 
adoption agreement in that way a second time. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said that the investigation of the Deeses is continuing and that he is 
attempting to locate other people who may have had dealings with the couple 
regarding adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
After a story on the Freeman case aired this week on the television program 
"Hard Copy," police learned from a Las Vegas doctor that Leanne Dees gave birth 
Dec. 7 to a boy. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Groom said in an interview that when the Deeses came to his office 
three weeks ago, they told him that they were willing to put the baby up for 
adoption. His office contacted a local couple looking to adopt a child and they 
were in the delivery room when the child was born. They had given no money to 
the Deeses. But last week, Leanne Dees left the hospital with the child and 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"When she left the hospital, she told them the baby would be theirs," said 
Groom, who has not been paid for the delivery. "Apparently, she changed her 
mind or never intended to give up the baby." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said Leanne Dees became aware of the publicity surrounding her and 
called him from Las Vegas on Thursday. She told the detective that she and her 
husband had named the baby Dalton and planned to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said the woman refused to reveal her location, and he declined to 
discuss other aspects of the conversation. The detective said he will present 
the case to prosecutors for the possible filing of charges later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Freeman says she is undaunted by the turmoil resulting from being so 
close to adopting a child and coming away with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"More than ever, I want to adopt," she said. "It's a matter of getting on your 
feet again and starting over."

COUNCILMAN LED 2 LIVES DURING PRIVATE TURMOIL; 
</P>
<P>
SAN FERNANDO: DANIEL ACUNA'S FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL PROBLEMS HAVE LED SOME TO 
QUESTION HIS ETHICS AND SUITABILITY TO SERVE THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Widely viewed about town as a congenial civil servant, San Fernando City 
Councilman Daniel Acuna won election to his second term of office eight months 
ago. His colleagues say he is an easygoing, confident lawmaker. His 
constituents know him as the longtime mailman who shakes hands and is eager to 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
But Acuna's public appearance belies a history of damaging legal and financial 
problems that have turned his life topsy-turvy and, by his own admission, 
pushed him into deeds he regrets. 
</P>
<P>
He failed to repay loans from several trusting constituents until they 
threatened to expose him. 
</P>
<P>
More than $250,000 in debt, he declared bankruptcy in 1987 and since then has 
defaulted on a $6,000 bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
He resigned his 20-year job as a postman when confronted with evidence that he 
failed to deliver a sack of mail. 
</P>
<P>
He lost his house and that of his parents to foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
At least one transaction involving $300 in campaign funds appears to be in 
violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
He writes checks on an account in the name of the San Fernando Civic Action 
Committee, a non-existent organization. 
</P>
<P>
"I admit I have made some mistakes and that there are things that have happened 
that I am not proud of," the 50-year-old Acuna said in an interview last week. 
He said his troubles are "strictly personal matters" rooted in a painful 1987 
divorce and a humiliating bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Several people who lent him money said at first the amiable politician, who 
served as mayor in 1989, befriended them. Acuna, they said, would invite them 
out to lunch or dinner. Or he would telephone to chitchat about civic affairs. 
Then he would ask to borrow money, saying he had run into tough times. 
</P>
<P>
"I trusted him. I thought 'Who better to lend money to than a mayor?' " said 
Mary Morley, 74, who lent him $2,000 in June. She said Acuna made good on a 
handwritten promissory note a month late, hours before a City Council meeting 
in which she and her 78-year-old husband had threatened to confront him in 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Although Acuna's woes appear to be largely confined to personal accounts, his 
critics and some council colleagues say his handling of them calls into 
question his ethics as a public official and suitability to serve the city. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the loan from the Morleys and one of $2,000 from another elderly 
San Fernando resident who died last summer have upset some past campaign 
supporters and several colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at this as a breach of ethical trust," Councilman Doude Wysbeek said. 
"If you burn a bank, that is one thing. But when you approach people as a 
councilman and ask them for money, that is a different issue. I don't think 
that is proper." 
</P>
<P>
"As a councilperson you walk a thin line," Mayor James B. Hansen said. "You are 
supposed to be above even things that could be acceptable if you were not in 
office. . . . Danny has problems and in some cases has acted imprudently." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission said last week that reviews of Acuna's actions are under 
way to determine whether a criminal investigation is warranted. The agencies 
would not release details about the nature of the reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Acuna said he is the target of a campaign to discredit his reputation led by a 
longtime town activist, Mary Jane Tuomy, who is bitter because she did not win 
his vote to be appointed to a vacant council seat. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't about political performance or leadership," Acuna said. "This is a 
personal vendetta initiated by someone who is very bitter and has decided to 
publicly embarrass me. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were talking about misuse of city funds, inefficiency, then certainly 
the questions would be valid. . . . I never, ever, would use my position as a 
council member for anything that was not connected to public business." 
</P>
<P>
Tuomy, who angrily called on Acuna to make good on his debts during an October 
council meeting, denied that she is leading a personal campaign against him. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want City Council members who are honest neighbors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando is a 2.4-square-mile town where residents routinely call their 
council members at home to discuss city issues and council candidates make 
campaign visits to voters. Acuna's financial mistakes have long been the topic 
of whispered conversations. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members said they have long been aware of his divorce and the 
bankruptcy but shied away from probing his personal affairs. Former City 
Administrator Donald E. Penman recalled receiving periodic phone calls at City 
Hall from angry creditors. He said he told them their complaints were private 
matters. Some residents said they were surprised when Acuna suddenly stopped 
delivering their mail but were satisfied when he told them he had tired of the 
job after 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like he had two personalities," Penman said. 
</P>
<P>
Acuna agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I was" living two lives, he said. "One gave me a solid foundation, 
solid ground to stand on. The other, when I say it was a nightmare, believe me 
it was a nightmare." He declined to discuss details, saying that he and his 
family have "been through enough pain." 
</P>
<P>
He said after the bankruptcy, divorce and loss of his job, he borrowed money 
"to survive" and was so overwhelmed with personal problems that he was not 
thinking about public perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Where did the money go? 
</P>
<P>
"If I knew that we wouldn't be here today would we?" he responded. 
</P>
<P>
He was running for reelection in the midst of his personal turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Acuna was elected in April, 1986, by voters who knew him as the 20-year town 
mailman. He lived in a modest house and drove an Oldsmobile. He had served on 
the Planning Commission and promised to work to revitalize the ailing business 
district. 
</P>
<P>
He said he sought the job because "it gave me the opportunity to focus on 
something positive. It was the only bright spot in my life. The only reason to 
get up in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a liquidation of assets 
in federal court in which the applicant is released from most debts. Court 
documents show that Acuna owed $254,558 to creditors including banks and 
department stores. Four loans totaling about $164,000 were secured by deeds of 
trust to two houses he owned, his and that of his parents. 
</P>
<P>
The debts against the houses were not forgiven by the court. The federal judge 
approved a foreclosure sale on both properties, records show. 
</P>
<P>
In a dispute over the ownership of the houses, the parents sued their son in 
civil court. The lawsuit was later settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
For a time he was officially wanted by the law. Although Acuna was released in 
bankruptcy court from a $12,800 loan from the Santa Clarita National Bank, the 
bank had filed a 1986 civil lawsuit against him to recover the money, records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
When Acuna failed to appear in San Fernando Superior Court for a hearing on the 
default, a civil warrant was issued for his arrest on Feb. 19, 1987, the first 
year of his election to office. Such civil warrants are handled by the county 
marshal and are typically served by mail. The warrant was canceled by the court 
in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
When told about the arrest warrant last week, Acuna said, "What?" 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know about it and could not remember why he failed to show 
up for court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"Emotionally, I was under a great deal of pressure. God, I wish I could have 
sat back and made clear decisions. When you see everything going downhill, I 
think it is pretty difficult to be someone who can suddenly get all this under 
control." 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1988, Acuna resigned from his job as a postal carrier after a sack of 
undelivered mail was found in his car, said Postal Inspector Donald Obritsch. 
In an internal Postal Service investigation, Acuna was accused of unlawfully 
delaying U.S. mail. 
</P>
<P>
"He confessed to unlawfully delaying all classes of mail, including 138 
pieces," said Obritsch. "His official file indicates that he resigned under 
investigation, pending removal." 
</P>
<P>
Although such a charge could be prosecuted as a felony in federal court, 
Obritsch said first offenses of this kind are typically handled internally by 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the circumstances of his departure from the Postal Service, 
Acuna said he left because "I was burned out." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bankruptcy Court legally eliminated his debts, court records show that 
Acuna recently defaulted on three loans. The largest was for $5,997 from the 
Bank of Granada Hills, which sought a court judgment to recover the money in 
March, records show. A bank official said the terms of the loan are 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kenneth Levitt, a former jewelry shop owner, sought a $279 
judgment against Acuna in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Beverly Sucich of Van Nuys, a former Postal Service colleague of 
Acuna's, was granted a court judgment for $2,000 against him for failure to pay 
back half of a $4,000 personal loan from 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"When he didn't show up for the court hearing, I was shocked," she said. "He is 
a councilman. I thought he of all people would show up. The fact that he had 
worked for the post office and he was so friendly made me have a lot of trust 
in him." 
</P>
<P>
Acuna said he didn't attend the hearing "because I didn't have the money to pay 
her." 
</P>
<P>
According to Howard Barmezel, Acuna's former landlord, the councilman also did 
not pay his rent in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"He owes me about $5,600," Barmezel said. "I let him slide because he was a 
city councilman and I didn't want to make any problems for him. . . . He seemed 
so nice, the all-American boy. I saw his picture in the papers. I kept thinking 
he would pay me." 
</P>
<P>
After seven months, Barmezel said, he tacked an eviction notice to Acuna's door 
and the councilman moved. Acuna now lives in an apartment complex on Harding 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
For the last several years, Acuna said, he has been paying his personal bills 
with checks drawn from an account in the name of the San Fernando Civic Action 
Committee. He used this account in September to pay the Morleys a $200 loan 
installment. 
</P>
<P>
Over a three-day period last week he gave three conflicting explanations about 
the nature of the account. 
</P>
<P>
First, he said he opened the account because he intended to start an 
organization that "was going to be something, well the name says exactly what 
it is going to be. . . . I had an idea to put together some type of nonprofit 
organization. There was no political purpose to it." He said the organization 
"never got off the ground" but he has kept the account active for personal 
business. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview a day later, he said that he opened the account because he 
wanted to start a group that would "get involved in addressing some issues 
involving kids." The money would be used "to make contributions to various 
community organizations." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled that he collected contributions for the non-existent group, but 
could not recall who gave him money or how much was collected. He said the 
donations were dispersed to a youth group but could not recall the name of the 
group. He said he would call back after researching his records. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Acuna said he had not yet found records of the donations but said he 
would continue looking. He said that the organization "did start out being a 
PAC," a political action committee, which under state law must be registered 
with the secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
"It started out with a very small amount of money," he said. "Later I used it 
as my personal account." 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state has no record of a campaign committee named the San 
Fernando Civic Action Committee. Neither does the state's Registry of 
Charitable Trusts, the agency with issues permits to collect donations for 
nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
An official with Trans World Bank, where the account is located, said bank 
policy prohibited him from discussing the nature of checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, Acuna was involved in a questionable transaction involving $300 in 
campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
Former City Councilman Mike Majers, owner of Majers' Liquor in San Fernando, 
said Acuna cashed a check written to him from a PAC controlled by Jess 
Margarito, a former town councilman. Campaign statements show that Margarito 
listed the check as a political contribution to Acuna's 1990 reelection 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
A provision in the state's Political Reform Act requires that contributions to 
a political candidate must be deposited into a campaign account. Any campaign 
expenditures of more than $100 must be made "by written instrument." 
</P>
<P>
Acuna confirmed that he cashed the check and said he spent the money mainly on 
food for campaign workers. He could not recall whether the bills exceeded $100. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his lingering financial troubles, Acuna said that he is beginning to 
find stability in his life. He has recently begun working as a real estate 
agent for Realty World -- Hill &amp; Romero Properties in Sepulveda. In April, 
he was the top vote-getter in an election for three council seats. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes San Fernando residents will "give me a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
"The people are the ones who will determine how long I will serve," he said. 
Then, in a tearful voice and rubbing his eyes, he said: "I'm afraid the people 
will not want me to serve them anymore. If that happens it will hurt. It is the 
one thing I am proudest of."

HOMEOWNERS' PICKETING FAILS TO DETER BUYERS IN PALMDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Icy weather and a protest by picketers who have filed a $5.1-million lawsuit 
over damaged houses in a Palmdale area development didn't stop buyers from 
snapping up 23 houses in the tract that were auctioned at discount prices 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The auction, attended by 200 people, was held by Santa Monica-based developer 
Watt Industries to sell slow-moving houses in its 125-lot Narcissa View Estates 
tract near Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Watt said the houses are sound, although five are near others that owners say 
were built on unstable soil. 
</P>
<P>
About 12 residents picketed the auction, warning bidders about their dispute 
with Watt and displaying pictures of their damaged houses. Those residents had 
wanted Watt to exchange their houses for those being auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a group of seven families in the development filed the lawsuit 
against Watt and several subsidiaries, accusing the builder of fraud and 
negligence. The owners say unstable soil is causing severely cracked 
foundations and walls, and may affect up to 20 Narcissa houses. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy seemed to make little difference, though, to bidders who 
offered about the same prices for the houses, regardless of their proximity to 
those damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive houses sold for $188,000, about $100,000 less than the last 
asking price of $285,000. 
</P>
<P>
Lee and Donna Williams, Palmdale residents who successfully bid $173,000 for a 
2,100-square-foot house near those belonging to the protesters, said they 
weren't worried about the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we got a really good buy," Lee Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary and Sally Romero of Burbank said they were a little nervous about the 
houses. However, they purchased a 2,000-square-foot dwelling away from the 
damaged ones for $187,000.

LAWNDALE EX-COUNCILMAN AND WIFE ARRESTED IN PROPERTY LINE DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An argument over a half-built redwood fence between neighboring properties 
resulted in the arrest Saturday of former Lawndale Councilman Dan McKenzie, 75, 
and his wife, Dolores, 71, for allegedly violating a court order. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Ballesteros, 65, and her daughter Audrey, 30, had won a temporary 
restraining order last week that required the McKenzies to move their cars from 
their side yard to enable workers to finish building the six-foot redwood fence 
between the properties. 
</P>
<P>
When the McKenzies refused to comply with the order, sheriff's deputies 
handcuffed them and took them to the station about 8 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfortunate situation," Lt. Larry Schwartz said. "We were forced to 
comply with the dictates of the court order, but we don't consider (the 
McKenzies) criminals." 
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 years, an ivy-covered chain-link fence stood between the two 
properties. The fence, which was built in 1958 by the former owner of the 
Ballesteroses' property, was placed a foot short of the property line. 
</P>
<P>
Dan McKenzie, who served on the council six years before retiring in April, 
says the former owner gave him the extra strip of land when he discovered the 
fence was in the wrong place "because he didn't want to move the fence." 
</P>
<P>
But the Ballesteroses say there never was any legal transfer and that the 
property is rightfully theirs. 
</P>
<P>
The McKenzies and the Ballesteroses haven't been friendly for years. Eleanor 
Ballesteros has accused Dan McKenzie of spray-painting slurs about Mexicans on 
his garage and calling her and her daughter derogatory names. McKenzie, who 
denies the charges, says Ballesteros constantly takes pictures of him and his 
wife in their yard and that he believes she was responsible for killing his 
dogs with rat poison last month. Ballesteros denies killing the dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Their relationship was further soured last month when the Ballesteroses decided 
to tear down the chain-link fence and replace it with the redwood fence, which 
was to be built closer to the original property line. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Ballesteros said in a court declaration that when the contractors began 
to build the fence on Dec. 3, Dan McKenzie "deliberately pushed his camper in 
front of the workers and directly in the path of where the fence was to be 
built." McKenzie, however, says he hasn't moved the camper for five or more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Then last week, the Ballesteroses received a temporary restraining order 
requiring the McKenzies to remove two other cars and the camper from the 
Ballesteroses' property so they could finish building the fence. When the 
McKenzies refused, Eleanor Ballesteros called the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Dan McKenzie posted $250 bail, but deputies allowed his wife to go without 
posting bail. Deputies then drove them home, Schwartz said. The McKenzies' cars 
were not towed from the area, however, because the court order wasn't specific 
enough to allow deputies to enter the McKenzies' property, Sgt. Dan Rosenberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge who issued the temporary restraining order is scheduled to make a 
final decision about the property line dispute on Jan. 2. Eight days later, the 
McKenzies are to appear on charges of violating the court order.

PROPOSED COUNTY ORDINANCE CALLS FOR BAN ON PARKING CARS IN YARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A car's place is in the driveway, the garage or -- if it is broken down -- in 
the junkyard. 
</P>
<P>
That was the message delivered last week by county planning officials, as they 
recommended approval of an ordinance that would prohibit drivers from parking 
cars in their front yards and reinforce an earlier law that bans homeowners 
from keeping old junkers on their properties. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance won unanimous approval Thursday from the Los Angeles 
County Regional Planning Commission. The County Board of Supervisors is 
expected to consider it within a month. If approved, it would affect 
unincorporated communities from Bassett in the San Gabriel Valley to Lennox in 
the South Bay and Walnut Park in the Southeast area of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping junk cars and parking on the front lawn have been viewed in some 
circles as property rights. But homeowners' associations and real estate agents 
argue that the practices are tacky and hurt property values. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Walnut Park Community Assn. said they have been complaining for 
more than five years to the county, the Sheriff's Department and, finally, to 
the Department of Regional Planning. 
</P>
<P>
"At some houses, there are junk cars parked one right after another from the 
back of the property right out to the street," said Floyd Dominguez, president 
of the community group. "Some of them have pickup trucks with differentials and 
other junk sticking out. It looks terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez said his group learned that neighboring cities had laws to control 
where vehicles are parked but that county statutes were not as well spelled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county code prohibits property owners from keeping "inoperable" 
vehicles on their properties, the term was never defined. Prosecutors had a 
difficult time enforcing inoperable-vehicle citations because the law was not 
clear, Deputy Dist. Atty. John Bax said. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance recommended by the commission last week defines such a vehicle as 
any that cannot operate legally on a state highway. It also specifically bans 
parking cars, whether broken down or brand new, in front yards. 
</P>
<P>
Car enthusiasts protested the proposed ordinance earlier this year. They said 
the ban on inoperable vehicles would prevent them from pursuing a legitimate 
hobby: rebuilding and restoring classic cars. 
</P>
<P>
County planners responded by including in the ordinance an exemption for 
historic or special-interest vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Beggs of the Assn. of California Car Clubs told the commission Thursday 
that the exemption satisfies most of the concerns of car collectors. Beggs said 
he remains concerned that some county code enforcement officers may not be able 
to distinguish a collector's car that is under repair from a clunker. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the success of the ordinance will depend on the discretion exercised 
by the individual inspectors," Beggs said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Lee Strong said he is worried that the exemption will permit those 
with broken down cars to avoid citations by claiming the cars are historic or 
special vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making changes for every little group," Strong said, "and, 
unfortunately, we are creating an ordinance that isn't any better than what we 
already have." 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed ordinance, penalties would remain the same as they are under 
existing law. Offenders are issued a citation, with a fine of about $100, on 
the first offense. Penalties increase after that.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRUST FUND SET UP TO AID WIDOW, BABY SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A church has established a trust fund to pay the medical expenses of the wife 
and son of a Mission Hills man killed last month by a suspected drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Santa Rosa Catholic Church in San Fernando set up the trust fund 
after Daniel Miramontes, 26, a youth minister at the parish, was killed Nov. 11 
when his car was struck by a speeding vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred in San Fernando at Glenoaks Boulevard and Harding Avenue 
as he and his wife, Diana, who was eight months pregnant, drove home from 
church. Diana Miramontes was critically injured and taken to Holy Cross Medical 
Center in Mission Hills. Their son, Daniel Miramontes Jr., was born by Cesarean 
section hours after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Both mother and son are recovering, but remain hospitalized. On Friday, Diana 
Miramontes took her first steps since the accident, said her father-in-law, 
Frank Miramontes. The baby, who was transferred to the intensive care newborn 
nursery at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys soon after the accident, is 
improving, his grandfather said. 
</P>
<P>
The church has collected almost $7,000, the Rev. David Ullrich said. 
</P>
<P>
Miramontes left a job as a printer in March to work full time with the youth 
group, Proyecto Amistad, or Project Friendship. Although insurance is paying 
the hospital expenses, Frank Miramontes said the family will need help to pay 
for later medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Donations may be made to the Danny and Diana Miramontes Trust Fund at the Santa 
Rosa Catholic Church Credit Union, P.O. Box 630, San Fernando 91341.

COWBOYS HAVE SHOT AT PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITO STELLINO, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Landry, a man who never wastes words, had a rather terse evaluation of the 
Dallas Cowboys a year ago when they were struggling through a 1-15 season. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take some time before they are to where they can compete," Landry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Landry wasn't exactly an unbiased observer. He had been fired by new owner 
Jerry Jones after 29 years of being the only coach the Cowboys ever had. 
</P>
<P>
But Landry's sentiments weren't exactly unusual. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people were scoffing at the Cowboys a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Johnson, who was Jones' college roommate, was being ridiculed for 
everything from his hairstyle to his offense. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his 52-9 record at the University of Miami, he was being called a 
college coach who didn't understand how to coach in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Lawrence Taylor of the New York Giants said Johnson's offense was so 
simple that he thought it was some kind of a trick. 
</P>
<P>
A lot has changed in a year. 
</P>
<P>
As the 6-7 Cowboys prepared to play the Phoenix Cardinals Sunday, they knew 
that if they won their last three games, they'd be in the playoffs this year. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the playoffs are watered down this year -- three wild-card teams from 
each conference now make it instead of two. 
</P>
<P>
But it still would qualify as the first time a club has made the playoffs the 
year after having the worst record in the National Football League since the 
Baltimore Colts went from 2-12 in 1974 to 10-4 in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The turnaround has been so abrupt that Johnson finds himself answering skeptics 
that he's raised expectations too high too quickly and will now be compared 
with Landry's legacy of 20 straight winning seasons and five Super Bowl 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have high expectations next year regardless," he said. "High expectations 
next year are a given, and it's ridiculous to say we won too many too fast. 
I'll deal with next year next year." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is serious about making the playoffs this year even though he's a long 
shot even if the Cowboys beat Phoenix. They have to travel to Philadelphia next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be severely disappointed (if we don't make it)," he said. "I'd not be 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys have done a lot of things right lately. They traded up in the first 
round to draft running back Emmitt Smith. Combined with quarterback Troy 
Aikman, he's a key to the offense of the future. They've also stockpiled draft 
picks in the Herschel Walker and Steve Walsh deals and have five first-round 
picks the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Even Jones, who was dubbed "(Bob) Irsay with a twang" last year for the clumsy 
way he fired Landry, is acting as if he understands how to run a club. 
</P>
<P>
He now admits he blew it by attending the first news conference when the firing 
of Landry was announced and he slammed the table and said Johnson was worth 
five No. 1 draft picks and five Heisman Trophy winners. 
</P>
<P>
"(Former President) Tex Schramm should have come in the room and basically said 
there has been a deal between Bum Bright and Jerry Jones, but what we're here 
about tonight is that Tom Landry will no longer be the coach of the Dallas 
Cowboys after 29 years. I shouldn't have even been on the same podium with that 
deal," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Cowboys are inching close to respectability, the real question is 
whether they can take the next step.

VAQUERO CLASSIC; 
</P>
<P>
BIG LEAD NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR CANYONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A dynamite first half was overshadowed by a markedly less explosive second half 
for College of the Canyons on Saturday night against Los Angeles City. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons led by as many as 19 points before intermission but lost, 74-69, in the 
championship game of the Vaquero Classic at Glendale College. 
</P>
<P>
One Canyons player stayed hot throughout the game. Shooting guard Dan Murphy 
made all 12 of his shots, hitting 10 field goals and two free throws for a 
team-high 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy scored 10 of his team's first 16 points, and Canyons led, 31-12, after 
L. A. City went scoreless for more than five minutes. Canyons (5-6) held a 
37-25 advantage at the break. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys didn't wake up," L. A. City Coach Reggie Morris said. "I had to chew 
them out at halftime to get some spirit." 
</P>
<P>
L. A. City (10-2) began to ease its scoring drought with some rain-making 
three-point baskets at the beginning of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Develle Walker hit a couple, and soon thereafter Carlo Davis made back-to-back 
three-point shots to give L. A. City its first lead, 44-43. 
</P>
<P>
As L. A. City turned up the defensive pressure, Canyons' hopes for an upset 
began to ebb. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they were going to come out pressuring us," Canyons Coach Lee Smelser 
said. "We just tried to sustain against the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Canyons took its last lead at 52-51 before L. A. City went on an 11-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
With 1 minute 11 seconds remaining, Canyons' Jeff Dorst hit the front end of a 
one-and-one to cut the deficit to 70-69 but Canyons could pull no closer. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat of a surprise championship-game participant, Canyons has taken 
advantage of a changing of the guards to rejuvenate its game. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the tournament, Smelser handed the point position to freshman David 
Langley and moved Nick Sanderson, perhaps Canyons' most talented player, to the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
Both flourished Saturday night. Langley scored 15 points, grabbed a 
team-leading eight rebounds, had four assists and two steals. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Cuesta tournament, I said, 'David, I'm going to put the ball in your 
hands, and we'll go from there,' " Smelser said. "It really lends some great 
quickness to us in the backcourt." 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson scored 14 and highlighted a strong floor game with six steals. Reggie 
Bell, Canyons' all-tournament representative, had eight assists and nine 
points. 
</P>
<P>
In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 58, Glendale 53 -- Beating Cypress and its 6-foot-10 center Eric Pauley 
proved to be too tall an order for a young Glendale team. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale trailed, 49-48, with 3:42 remaining but a pair of costly turnovers 
allowed Cypress to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
"We made two critical errors on offense back-to-back and that's the way it's 
been happening, back-to-back," Glendale Coach Brian Beauchemin said. "Our 
inexperience has showed quite a bit in the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Pauley had game-high honors in scoring and rebounding with 23 points and eight 
rebounds. Only four Glendale players scored. 
</P>
<P>
"That has been a surprising problem because we have been equally distributing 
minutes," Beauchemin said. "We didn't get much help off the bench tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Enoch Mack and Chris Cooke both scored 19 for Glendale, and all-tournament pick 
Kelly Crosby posted 10 and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (6-7) fell behind 11-2 early but trailed only 23-22 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale led by as many as five points in the second half but lost the lead for 
good when Cypress pulled ahead, 43-42.

TYNER, BYRNE LEAD ROYAL TO TITLE, 77-65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
David Tyner's 14 first-quarter points gave Royal High what figured to be an 
insurmountable lead in Saturday night's championship game of the Beverly Hills 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But when Redondo mounted a fourth-quarter comeback, cutting the Highlanders' 
16-point lead to two, Tyner again came to the rescue, scoring eight points in 
the final 3 minutes 15 seconds as Royal won the championship, 77-65. 
</P>
<P>
Royal (7-1) led, 26-14, after the first quarter, 35-26 at halftime and 50-39 
after three quarters. A basket by Jared Byrne, named the tournament's most 
outstanding player, and two free throws and a three-point basket by Tyner 
boosted the lead to 57-41 early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sea Hawks (6-3) responded with a 16-2 run, cutting the lead to 59-57 
with 4:37 left. Redondo's Ted Silva and Jason Correa both missed shots that 
would have tied the score, and Silva missed the front end of a one and one. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo again closed to within two when Silva's basket cut Royal's lead to 
63-61 with three minutes left. Tyner, who finished with 31 points, then ignited 
a game-closing 14-4 spurt. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Ventura 66, Saugus 55 -- The Cougars, who have won this tournament a record 
eight times, came away with the consolation title, breaking open what had been 
a close contest by scoring the game's final eight points, all from the 
free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (3-3) held Saugus (5-3) scoreless after Chris Hernandez's layup cut the 
Cougar lead to 58-55 with 1:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Seiler made four free throws and Larry Anter and Curtis Vaughn each hit two 
to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We played very well," said Ventura Coach Dan Larson, the tournament's most 
valuable player when he led the Cougars to championships in 1976 and 1977. "We 
overcame a stupid first half. We only turned the ball over twice in the second 
half against a real tough defense." 
</P>
<P>
Saugus shot 33.8% from the field, making 22 of 65 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the wrong guys shooting the ball, which I guess is my fault," Saugus 
Coach John Clark said. "I didn't think we were very tough down the stretch 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
Playing in a gym forever immortalized in the film "It's a Wonderful Life," 
Saugus led, 45-43, after three quarters. After Ventura's Chris Rockwell and 
Hernandez exchanged baskets to open the quarter, the Cougars went on a 9-2 run, 
taking a lead they would not relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura held a 28-27 lead at intermission. But the advantage and the game 
almost got away from the Cougars. Geoff Dains hit three three-point shots, 
giving Saugus a 38-30 lead. Ventura regrouped with a 7-0 spurt later in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Seiler (17 points) led three Cougar players in double figures. Mike Ryken added 
14 and Randy Martinez 12. Dains led Saugus with 17 points and foul-plagued 
center Greg Yumbar had 11. 
</P>
<P>
Buena 81, Rolling Hills 77 -- Lance Fay's three free throws in the final 42 
seconds clinched the win for Buena (4-3) in the fifth-place game. 
</P>
<P>
Fay, who was named to the all-tournament team, and Matt Burtolin each had 18 
for Buena. Nick Houchin and Matt Egan contributed 16 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame 54, Rio Mesa 51 -- Kirk Miller's two free throws with 31 seconds 
left gave Notre Dame its final margin of victory in the seventh-place game. 
</P>
<P>
G. C. Marcaccini had a game-high 21 points, plus 11 rebounds for Notre Dame 
(7-3). Monte Marcaccini, G. C.'s sophomore brother, added 11 points and a 
game-high 12 rebounds. Manuk Kayaoglu, a foreign exchange student from Turkey, 
scored 16 points for Rio Mesa (1-5). 
</P>
<P>
Glendale 56, Westlake 49 -- Jerry Armen had 19 points and six assists and Jason 
Harper had 12 points and 12 rebounds for Glendale (3-4) in a consolation game.

GIBBS, NORTHRIDGE SUIT EACH OTHER BUT LOSING DOES NOT WEAR WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THERESA MUNOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lucious Harris snared the inbounds pass and fed Kevin Cutler, his 6-foot-8, 
230-pound teammate. It was all Keith Gibbs could do to get in the way -- and 
Cutler slammed it over the 6-5, 180-pound Gibbs like he was intramural 
material. 
</P>
<P>
Adding insult to embarrassment, Gibbs was whistled for the foul. His face 
appeared to explode in a mix of helplessness, frustration and anger. Again, he 
and his Cal State Northridge teammates couldn't stop a steamroller. Cutler's 
jam marked the 12th of 15 consecutive Cal State Long Beach points. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs has never known a season like this: His team has two wins, six losses. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most frustrated I've ever been," he said after the Long Beach 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a losing record. My youth soccer teams were state champs, my 
high school and junior college basketball teams had winning traditions. It 
makes it really hard for me. Every game on the road the embarrassment gets to 
you. I'm not used to losing. I hate it." 
</P>
<P>
Although a shooting slump has limited him to an 11-point average, Gibbs is 
doing all he can to stop the slide. He pulls down 4.3 rebounds per game and 
leads the Matadors in assist (5.0) and steal (2.5) averages. 
</P>
<P>
In the season-opening loss to Colorado, Gibbs broke the CSUN single-game record 
for assists with 15. In CSUN's first win, he tied Derrick Gathers' school 
record for steals with seven. 
</P>
<P>
As co-captain, he also is doing his best to keep team spirits from sagging. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we're losing, and whoever reads this thing is not going to believe 
it, I still think we can compete with these people," Gibbs said last weekend 
after Montana State pounded CSUN, 104-78. 
</P>
<P>
At the hotel after the game, Gibbs organized a team meeting designed to ensure 
a shared misery. 
</P>
<P>
He has always been loyal to his teammates, whether it has meant taking a punch 
in defense of a junior college teammate or agreeing to play an unfamiliar 
position. 
</P>
<P>
This season Gibbs was asked to become a point guard when Eugene Humphrey, the 
incumbent at that position, quit the team three weeks before the opener. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Gibbs was settling in quite nicely as a shooting guard in the 
Matadors' run- and-gun system. In the team's first intra-squad scrimmage, 21 of 
his game-high 35 points were scored on three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
But with Humphrey gone and freshman Andre Chevalier a 
not-ready-for-prime-time-player, Gibbs took the reins at point where his height 
advantage enhanced his already fine passing skills. 
</P>
<P>
"Passing is my favorite part of the game . . . as long as they score," Gibbs 
said. "In the past, coaches have told me that I pass too much." 
</P>
<P>
Being a tall point guard has its advantages, but not when it comes to chasing 
down particularly quick guards such as New Mexico State's Randy Brown and 
Colorado's Stevie Wise. 
</P>
<P>
"Andre (Chevalier) could stay with them, but not me," Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
The added responsibilities of running the offense also hindered his scoring 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've ever had a shooting slump like that," said Gibbs, who shot 
less than 30% for the first four games. 
</P>
<P>
"My rhythm was really off on my three-pointers. My whole delivery was off. My 
mind was going in other places and I was trying to do too much." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Burton, Gibbs' coach the past two seasons at West Valley College in 
Saratoga, Calif., said he was surprised to find Gibbs riding shotgun in the 
Matadors' new run-and-run system. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he can run the point but not in a Loyola Marymount situation," Burton 
said. "He doesn't have the blazing speed of a point, though he has good speed 
for a three-man." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Gibbs, the experiment didn't last too long. Chevalier quickly 
developed into a starting point guard, allowing Gibbs to move to the wing. 
</P>
<P>
"His game is much better off there," CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy said. "He can take 
the ball to the hole well, and once he gets his rhythm outside then he'll be a 
real threat." 
</P>
<P>
In his first game on the wing, Gibbs scored a season-high 19 points against 
Montana State and, as evidenced by his six assists against Long Beach, Gibbs 
still can utilize his passing skills away from the point. 
</P>
<P>
But the most impressive display of his athletic ability in the Long Beach game 
was the reverse dunk he made after a pass from Chevalier, who forsook a 
breakaway layup to watch Gibbs show off. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known him since he was a kid coming to summer camp and he's always had 
great springs," Burton said of Gibbs, who has a 39-inch vertical leap. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year he was one of the best jumpers in junior college ball. He had a 
flair to his game. At times, I was amazed by the things he did in the air. We 
set up some plays for him and he put down some devastating dunks." 
</P>
<P>
After dunking 45 times last season, Gibbs took his show on the road to dunking 
contests in San Jose, where he beat out San Francisco 49er receiver Jerry Rice, 
and Venice Beach, where he turned heads with a windmill and a 360, a la Michael 
Jordan, but missed on an approach over the top of a friend's head. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs has five of the Matadors' eight dunks this season, including a one-handed 
rebound and dunk that caused a Montana State fan to mutter, "Shaquille O'Neal." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Gibbs did not see a similar dunk on television the same day by 
O'Neal, LSU's sophomore center, but that was only because his pregame meal 
interfered. Gibbs is an avid basketball fan with more than 200 videotapes of 
highlights, some of which are set to music. 
</P>
<P>
His coach, however, is not as enamored of fancy dunks. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like flamboyance and stylin' for the sake of flamboyance and stylin'," 
Cassidy said. "I'd like to get the two points. I understand the need for Keith 
to express himself, to a point." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gibbs averaged 14 points, eight rebounds and seven assists a game his 
senior year at Westmont High in San Jose, he didn't attract much interest from 
four-year schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't ready," Gibbs said. "I knew before my senior year that I was going 
(to a junior college)." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Gibbs, he wasn't ready to play as a freshman at West Valley, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"I was still real immature," Gibbs said. "I was real inconsistent. I wasn't 
good enough to be inconsistent and still play." 
</P>
<P>
Burton at first planned to redshirt Gibbs, but when another player became 
injured, Gibbs was forced into action. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we couldn't take him off the court so I could just picture how good 
he could be if he was a sophomore now," Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs averaged 17.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and seven assists a game as a 
sophomore and drew recruiting interest from Washington and Oregon State -- 
until they saw his grades. 
</P>
<P>
"School is hard for me," he said. "I'm smart enough, but I'm not motivated 
enough. It scares me sometimes. My study skills have never been that good. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have graduated from high school if I didn't have basketball. I love 
it so much I didn't want to miss out." 
</P>
<P>
The threat of missing out keeps Gibbs going to class and doing his homework. He 
needs few reminders -- especially with the absences of teammates Percy Fisher 
and Erik Cooper, both of whom are academically ineligible this semester. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard for them every time we leave for a trip," Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge was the most persistent among schools that maintained interest in 
Gibbs despite his 2.1 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
"Northridge felt honest," Gibbs said. "It felt like the right place for me." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a 2-6 record, Gibbs feels he made a good choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no regrets," he said. "If you regret things, you can't go on. The type 
of team we have, they are fun to be around even when you are losing."

JUDGE TO REPLACE MURDER DEFENSE TEAM BECAUSE OF CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County Superior Court judge will appoint new attorneys for a Canoga 
Park man charged with murdering an 8-year-old Northridge boy. The change is 
being made because the public defenders have represented one of the 
prosecution's key witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Steven Z. Perren's decision will set back the trial of Gregory Scott 
Smith, 21, for several months, just as it neared the end of a monthlong jury 
selection, one attorney said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict of interest involved Tracy Ray Prell, 26, of Simi Valley, an 
informant serving a two-year jail sentence for misdemeanor battery and 
obstructing a peace officer. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Duane Dammeyer said his office has previously 
represented Prell. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we would not be in a position to cross-examine that witness because he 
was our client." 
</P>
<P>
Smith is accused of the kidnap and murder of Paul Bailly, who disappeared March 
23 after his mother dropped him off at a day-care program at Darby Avenue 
School in Canoga Park. Paul's body was found several hours later in a field in 
the Santa Susana Knolls area in Simi Valley. Prosecutors have alleged that 
Smith abducted Paul, gagged him with duct tape, strangled him and then set fire 
to his body. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a letdown to be taken off the case," said Dammeyer, adding that 
lawyers were within days of selecting a jury. "But legally there was no other 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Dammeyer said he and Deputy Public Defender Richard Holly will turn their work 
over to the new attorneys.

BROOKS BECOMES ODD MAN OUT, IS DEALT FOR OJEDA; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: TRADE, COMBINED WITH SIGNING OF FREE AGENT BUTLER, SOLIDIFIES THE 
OUTFIELD SITUATION AND PROVIDES A LEFT-HANDED PITCHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the Dodgers' most popular players became a surprising victim of their 
outfield crunch Saturday when Hubie Brooks was traded to the New York Mets for 
left-handed pitcher Bob Ojeda and pitching prospect Greg Hansell. 
</P>
<P>
The trade was completed almost exactly 24 hours after the Dodgers acquired free 
agent center fielder Brett Butler. That agreement enabled Darryl Strawberry to 
move to right field, essentially forcing the Dodgers to either trade right 
fielder Brooks or move him to left field and trade Kal Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
Many players thought Daniels, 27, would be traded because he is seven years 
younger that Brooks and has a higher market value. And many players, admiring 
Brooks' quiet leadership and clutch hitting, hoped he would stay. 
</P>
<P>
"Hubie didn't have one enemy -- Hubie was one of our cornerstones," outfielder 
Chris Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, the Dodger vice president who did not flinch last season when 
trading team leader Willie Randolph during a losing streak, might have ignored 
chemistry again. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I am concerned about chemistry, but we now have a ballclub that should 
produce victories . . . and victories produce chemistry," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
Claire is counting on Ojeda as the only left-hander in a starting rotation that 
includes Ramon Martinez, Tim Belcher, Kevin Gross and Orel Hershiser when he is 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
This rotation could also include Fernando Valenzuela if he accepts the club's 
offer for a one-year arbitrated contract. But Valenzuela, meeting with advisers 
this weekend, might feel squeezed out by Ojeda and refuse the Dodgers' offer. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Valenzuela could surprise the Dodgers, as did Juan Samuel by accepting a 
similar offer Saturday morning. Samuel will compete for the second base job 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"If Fernando comes back, that will please us . . . it will give us a pitching 
surplus, and we will use that surplus," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, Ojeda is a suitable replacement. In parts of 11 major league 
seasons, mostly as a starter, he is 95-79 with a 3.65 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, after being left out of a crowded Met rotation, Ojeda was 7-6 with 
a 3.66 ERA in 38 games, including 12 starts. He held left-handed batters to a 
.168 average. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like a big kid being back home," said Ojeda, a Los Angeles native, in a 
conference call Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up like everybody down there, watching Vin Scully and the Farmer John 
Hot Dog." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda, Dodger manager, announced on the call that Ojeda would no longer 
be in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"That is music to my ears, Tommy," said Ojeda, who will turn 33 next week. "You 
are the maestro down there. I am looking forward to this year like I've looked 
forward to no other year." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "The bullpen, I don't like it. I'm not ready for it. When I'm 37, 
I'll be ready for it. I have proved, when I get a chance, I can still pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said that Ojeda completes the Dodgers 1991 team, even if the roster 
doesn't include a veteran left-handed relief pitcher. Their only veteran in 
that area, Ray Searage, was released Friday to make room for Butler. 
</P>
<P>
"I can get around that -- we have Dennis Cook and David Walsh, we'll be fine 
there," Lasorda said, later adding, "I'm very happy with this ballclub with the 
way it is set. If the season started tomorrow, we'd be ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you this much, a lot of pitchers who pitch against this club, the 
night before they go to sleep, they are going to be doing a lot of tossing and 
turning." 
</P>
<P>
One problem for the Dodgers is that most of those pitchers will be left-handed. 
Because they traded Brooks instead of Daniels, four of the Dodgers' top five 
power hitters will bat left-handed. This includes Strawberry, Butler, Daniels 
and Mike Scioscia. Only switch-hitting Eddie Murray will keep left-handed 
pitchers honest. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I'll admit, we are overbalanced in that area," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers will miss Brooks in other ways, and not only because he was third 
on the team with 20 home runs and 91 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"Hubie was one of the three or four people Tommy could always count on," Gwynn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought this team stability." 
</P>
<P>
And Brooks will miss the Dodgers. The Southland native believed he had returned 
home for good last winter when he signed a three-year contract as a free agent 
from Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
When Brooks was told about the acquisition of Butler late Friday, he reacted 
with dismay. 
</P>
<P>
"It does look like I've lost a job," Brooks said at the time. "I can't believe 
it. I do feel like the odd man out. What are they going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn said Brooks, who could not be reached late Saturday, phoned him 
immediately after the trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Hubie was shocked," Gwynn said. "You could tell he was really disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Claire: "I loved Hubie. Trading him was one of most difficult things I 
ever have had to do." 
</P>
<P>
At least one Dodger was understandably happy about the move. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got home to spend Christmas with my family, and this is one great 
present," Daniels said late Saturday from his Warner Robins, Ga., home. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad for Hubie, and I thought I would be the one traded because my trade 
value was higher, but I am glad they didn't choose me. 
</P>
<P>
"I am really happy to stay in Los Angeles. It looks like our puzzle is all 
coming together. We are looking like a championship team." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Hansell, the other Met acquired in the Brooks trade, is a former 
12th-round draft pick from La Palma Kennedy High in Orange County. He is a 
right-hander who spent last season in Class A. He was 7-10 with a 3.60 ERA for 
Winter Haven, Fla., of the Boston Red Sox's organization, then was traded to 
the Mets and went 2-4 with a 2.61 ERA for St. Lucie, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers finally announced that they had agreed to terms with Brett Butler 
at 8 a.m. Saturday, 12 hours after Butler had confirmed it. Fred Claire, Dodger 
vice president, did not announce it sooner because he had promised Dick Moss, 
Butler's agent, that he would give Moss time to contact the two other teams 
bidding for Butler's services, Atlanta and Boston. Lou Gorman, Boston general 
manager, did not return home until late Friday, and was not contacted until 
Saturday morning. Butler was given a $1-million signing bonus with a 
$2.5-million salary next season, $3 million in 1992, $3 million in 1993, and a 
$3-million option in 1994 with a $500,000 buyout.

JIM MURRAY: PLAYOFFS EASY TO PREDICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the NFL playoffs are almost upon us, it's time to reflect not only on 
what may happen but on what probably will. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
1. Two teams will struggle for 58 minutes to a 10-7 score featured by a 
rock-ribbed pass rush, but in the last two minutes, resorting to exotic 
defenses, each team will be scored on twice. The coaches will see no 
correlation between the scoring and defense but will hail instead the 
"two-minute drill" of the victors, ignoring the fact the Mack Sennett Cops 
Drill defense will have far more to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
2. The NFC will win the Super Bowl, 40-10. 
</P>
<P>
3. Fans who stood in the snow or sleet all night to get tickets will be treated 
to two to four minutes of a quarterback falling on the football or kneeling out 
the clock, causing old-timers to mutter darkly, "Johnny Unitas never fell on a 
football in his life." 
</P>
<P>
4. A team with five 9.4 sprinters at the flanks and a 62% passer at the wheel 
will get to the five-yard line and send a 180-pound running back hurtling into 
the middle of two tons of massed mastodonic defense three times and have to 
settle for a humiliating field goal. 
</P>
<P>
5. If the run-and-shoot offense gets to the finals or even close to it, 21 of 
the 28 teams will go to it next year. 
</P>
<P>
6. The best quarterback will win the Super Bowl, not necessarily the best team. 
See about Warren Moon because all his team has to do is hold the opposition 
under 21 points. But if Joe Montana gets the ball in the last 30 seconds 
needing only a field goal to win, go home and beat the traffic. It's over. 
</P>
<P>
7. Two coaching staffs will work around the clock for a week, designing 
offensive or defensive schemes and elaborate zones and confusing splits, but 
three or more games will be decided because nobody can fall on a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
8. Hope that the Philadelphia Eagles somehow find a way into the playoffs 
because Randall Cunningham with the football is Magic Johnson bringing the ball 
upcourt, Gene Kelly dancing in the rain or Willie Mays with a 3-and-2 count. 
What you came to see. 
</P>
<P>
9. Three out of five overtime games -- make that five out of five -- will be 
decided by a field goal, which means that the game will be decided by the coin 
flip because defending teams will forget that the goal line in that situation 
is their 35 and not the one. 
</P>
<P>
10. The Buffalo Bills, everyone's favorite to go to the Super Bowl, won't. 
</P>
<P>
11. The crowd will be a factor in at least three games, which means the 
visiting quarterback has to face not only 11 hostile players but 70,000 
full-throated fans, but the officials who would penalize a player who roughed 
up a quarterback for unsportsmanlike conduct lets the customers rough the 
quarterback all they want. 
</P>
<P>
12. The New York Giants won't lose to the 49ers again. 
</P>
<P>
13. With six wild-card teams, the chances are good one of them will be a Super 
Bowl contender, and maybe both will. The statistic that the Raiders are the 
only wild-card team ever to win the Super Bowl will be brought up 711 times 
Super Bowl week. 
</P>
<P>
14. If Seattle gets in the playoffs, it will win or lose at least one game with 
only two seconds remaining on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
15. If Washington gets in the playoffs, Joe Gibbs will outcoach the guy across 
the field from him -- unless that guy is Don Shula. 
</P>
<P>
16. Mike Ditka will blame the media if his quarterback throws five 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
17. Mike Ditka's quarterback will throw five interceptions. Mike Ditka will 
throw a tantrum. 18. There will be a lot of red faces around the league if the 
Dallas Cowboys find their way into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
19. Games won against New England should not count in computing eligibility for 
the playoffs. Games won against Atlanta should count only half. Beating Denver 
at sea level should count as a tie. 
</P>
<P>
20. Kansas City will surprise a lot of people. But then, it already has. 
</P>
<P>
21. If Bo Jackson gets in a Super Bowl, the other 21 players might as well play 
with a bag over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
22. If Cincinnati falls by the wayside again, shouldn't Boomer Esiason be 
called Buster Esiason? 
</P>
<P>
23. If the Pittsburgh Steelers get in the playoffs, shouldn't Chuck Noll at 
least smile once in a while? He always looks as if he just heard his house was 
on fire. 
</P>
<P>
24. When the Buffalo Bills are in the game, the best player on the field will 
be a defensive end. Bruce Smith thinks he's the best player in the game, and I 
agree with him. He has moves we haven't seen since Deacon Jones. If the head 
slap were still legal, he'd make every tackle. He almost does anyway. 
</P>
<P>
25. If Joe Montana completes a bomb to Jerry Rice, look for the announcers to 
talk learnedly about how he "read the defensive set" when the truth of the 
matter is, Joe just said in the huddle, "OK, everybody out for a long one." 
</P>
<P>
26. Another announcer will say a cornerback "blew the coverage" when the truth 
is, no one running backward can run as fast as Jerry Rice running forward. 
</P>
<P>
27. At least one game will be played in life-threatening weather. Not 
threatening to the players, to the fans. 
</P>
<P>
28. The Super Bowl, which has been won 17 of the 24 times by "grandfather" 
franchises, i.e. teams existing before the formation of the American Football 
League (the figure is 20 out of 24 if you throw out three of the Minnesota 
Vikings' losses to the upstarts), will lose its mystique if the "other" league 
doesn't get more competitive. The facts of the matter are that, of the truly 
old-line football families, only the Washington Redskins, Rams and Philadelphia 
Eagles have ever lost in the Super Bowl. In the last six Super Bowls, the count 
has been: the Establishment (NFC) 240, the New Kids on the Block (AFC) 82. If 
that's a contest, so was Germany against the Low Countries.

QBS FALL IN BILLS' VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: BUFFALO HOLDS OFF GIANTS, 17-13, AFTER INJURIES TO SIMMS AND 
KELLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When they won the game in the first half, the Buffalo Bills looked like a San 
Francisco 49er team playing the no-huddle offense. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Buffalo's best defensive player, Bruce Smith, resembling the 
old Lawrence Taylor, broke down the New York Giants' offense. 
</P>
<P>
Then both teams lost their quarterbacks -- possibly for the season -- whereupon 
the Bills hung on to get a 17-13 victory Saturday in a matchup that was billed 
in nearby Manhattan as a Super Bowl preview. 
</P>
<P>
It might not be remembered as that unless the two quarterbacks return. 
</P>
<P>
On a chilly, rainy day in Giants Stadium, Buffalo's Jim Kelly went down first, 
leaving late in the first half with damaged knee ligaments that could require 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be out three weeks unless I'm lucky," he kept saying. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, New York's Phil Simms went to the bench with a sprained 
arch, which, the doctors said, can be more serious than it sounds or looks. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that the Simms X-rays were negative," Giant Coach Bill 
Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
It was about the only good news the Giants had in the course of slipping to 
11-3 in the highly competitive NFC. They had entered December 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills advanced to 12-2 when they survived a second-half battle of backup 
quarterbacks, a struggle in which Buffalo's Frank Reich and New York's Jeff 
Hostetler moved their teams repeatedly though scoring only three points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
After Kelly had outplayed Simms in a 14-10 first half, Hostetler's 
third-quarter drive improved the Giants to 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
That put it up to Reich, who, on the game's next series, drove the Bills to the 
three points that got Buffalo in position to win, 17-13, unless Hostetler could 
take the Giants to a fourth-quarter touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't his fault that he couldn't. On one possession he came down to the 
Buffalo 13, where, in shotgun formation on third down, Giant center Bart Oates 
took his club out of field goal range with a wild snap. 
</P>
<P>
Next, reaching the Buffalo 21 on a 17-yard pass to wide receiver Stephen Baker, 
Hostetler lost all that, and 10 yards more, on offensive pass interference 
against a decoy receiver who was across the field from Baker. 
</P>
<P>
"We must have had 10 opportunities to (win) this one and blew them all," 
Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
Giant linebacker Taylor, for example, was in position to score two touchdowns 
on intercepted passes. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't make the plays," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus he was outplayed by Smith, Buffalo's 275-pound defensive end, who had 
promised he would. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't knocking Taylor last week when I said I'm better than he is," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"My full statement was this: Over the last 10 years, Taylor was the most 
dominant defensive player in the game. This season, I have emerged to be the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
On Taylor's own turf, it looked that way. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills, however, have played good defense for years. What's different about 
this team is that it's also playing good offense. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Marv Levy and his offensive coordinator, Ted Marchibroda, have given 
Buffalo a well-structured short-passing attack that resembles San Francisco's. 
In fact, it proved more successful against New York than San Francisco's -- 
which had been held to one touchdown Dec. 3 in the 49ers' 7-3 victory over the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
There were two reasons for that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most Buffalo plays were dispatched from no-huddle formations that kept the 
Giants off balance throughout most of Kelly's time on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Bills' main ballcarrier, Thurman Thomas, demonstrated again that he is 
one of the league's quickest. Though weighing less than 200 pounds, Thomas 
obliged the Giants to put more men on him than they had put on any 49er running 
back earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
A year or two ago, the Buffalo offense was as conservative as the Giants' still 
is. 
</P>
<P>
"We've evolved into this gradually," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can play a more (wide open) game now because we have the people to do it -- 
especially a big tight end who can catch the ball, Keith McKeller, not to 
mention (wide receivers) Andre Reed, James Lofton and Don Beebe." 
</P>
<P>
Said Buffalo General Manager Bill Polian: "We decided in the off-season that we 
have the personnel to open up in the no-huddle offense." 
</P>
<P>
In other years, the Bills haven't really integrated pass plays into their 
run-oriented offense until the playoffs, when it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
The way they passed in the first half won a big game. On successive series, 
Kelly led the Bills 76 and 78 yards to short-yardage touchdowns -- throwing 
sometimes from shotgun formation on first down and moving the team as a rule 
with no-huddle plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We have what it takes to run the no-huddle now," Levy said. "We can leave our 
regular personnel on the field and throw the ball in power formations." 
</P>
<P>
Reed scored the first touchdown on a six-yard pass and Thomas the second when 
he cut inside Taylor on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants had begun the game by plodding 71 yards on the ground to a 
fourth-and-a-foot touchdown by halfback Ottis Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, finally replacing Anderson, rookie Rodney Hampton gained most of 
his 105 yards on similar ground plays. His problem in the clutch was that he 
ran into Smith too often. 
</P>
<P>
Once more, the Giants seemed to be playing too conservatively to make a Super 
Bowl impression this winter. For example, on successive plays at midfield in 
the second quarter, they ran the ball on second and four and third and two, 
then punted. 
</P>
<P>
On their next series, after getting to the Buffalo 10-yard line on penalties, 
the Giants played for their field goal with a power run, a draw play, and a 
third-down pass that Simms threw away. 
</P>
<P>
That used to be Buffalo football, too. No more. The Bills have jumped into 
Super Bowl contention by abandoning their conservative approach. On numerous 
running downs now, they throw the ball, they attack their opponents, they come 
with four receivers on first down, they leave the huddling to such as the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Bills can stay in the championship race is now up to Reich, who was 
3-0 replacing Kelly last year. He seems to have the native ability. On defense, 
Smith has it.

ON THE PREP PATH: LOARA BASKETBALL PROMOTIONS START WITH THE PROMOTER: WHITLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior guard Tes Whitlock is reason enough to watch Loara High School's 
basketball team -- he's averaging 37 points a game -- but Whitlock wants to 
offer people even more reasons to fill the stands. 
</P>
<P>
So Whitlock has taken it upon himself to become the team's unofficial director 
of marketing and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
A challenging job? Probably, especially considering Loara's not-so-hot past. 
The Saxons haven't won a league title since 1966, and in Whitlock's three years 
of varsity play, Loara has yet to make it to the playoffs while compiling a 
league record of 7-23. 
</P>
<P>
It's not exactly the makings of a blockbuster. But hey, if four sewer-dwelling 
teen-age turtles can hit the big time, why not one semi-cellar-dwelling 
basketball program? 
</P>
<P>
So Whitlock schemes. His motto? "Just Oooooh It." 
</P>
<P>
"I like to do things that make people go 'Ooooooh,' " he said, referring more 
to his dazzling play than his promotional ploys. 
</P>
<P>
At Loara's first home game, Whitlock arranged for the gym lights to go out 
while spotlights fell on each Loara player as they were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
At another game, Whitlock talked the school choir into taking the court for the 
national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, he's working on having fireworks go off during player introductions. 
Yes, inside the gym. 
</P>
<P>
There's no doubt this would draw a large crowd (the entire Anaheim Fire 
Department, for instance?), but Whitlock should also consider the risks. He 
doesn't want to start the game with a pyrotechnical foul. 
</P>
<P>
Promotions aside, everyone who has seen Whitlock play knows nothing challenges 
him as Loara's No. 1 attraction. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock knows it, too, and he's not embarrassed to say it. Across the back of 
his letterman's jacket is the word "Showtime," which is a lot easier to say 
than his first two names, Yves Monttes. 
</P>
<P>
"I like doing anything that'll make people come back to the game," he said. 
"Anything that'll make people say, 'Oh! Did you see that?' " 
</P>
<P>
His most faithful fans might be a group of 6- and 7-year-old boys who come to 
home games. Members of a local National Junior Basketball team, they sit in the 
front row, watching Whitlock's every move. 
</P>
<P>
But there's one particular move they wait -- and chant -- for: "Dunk! Dunk! 
Dunk!" 
</P>
<P>
"That's all they want, for me to dunk," said Whitlock, who runs by and 
high-fives the kids during games. "They wouldn't care if I made a full-court 
shot. They'd clap, but they want to see me dunk." 
</P>
<P>
Others are quite satisfied by Whitlock's willingness to shoot any time, 
anywhere. And so is he. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the jumper," he said, smiling. "My motto is, 'When I step off the bus, 
I'm open.' Win, lose or draw, I'm going for it. I'm playing free-lance 
basketball. I'm not being cocky -- there's just no one who can stop me." 
</P>
<P>
Consider Whitlock's 49-point performance against Pacifica. Thirty of his points 
came in one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"That 30 points in eight minutes was the greatest eight minutes I swear I've 
ever seen in basketball -- pros, college or high school," said Ed Prange, 
Loara's first-year coach. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just stepping across the half-court line and shooting. When we watched 
the film later, Tes said, 'Coach, I had no idea I was that far out. Why did you 
let me keep shooting?' I said, 'Are you kidding?' " 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it doesn't always work so spectacularly. Last Monday in the 
Tournament of Champions, Mater Dei forced Whitlock (33 points) to pass more 
than shoot and, as has been the case this year, his teammates couldn't respond 
to the challenge. Loara lost, 74-61. 
</P>
<P>
It was a similar case two days later in a 101-81 loss to Inglewood. Although 
Whitlock finished with 41 points -- he hit five of six three-pointers in the 
fourth quarter -- he shot 13 for 33 and blamed himself for the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
If you saw either loss, you might have wondered why Whitlock (who is shooting 
41% from the field, 40% from three-point range) takes so many shots that seem 
rushed and slightly off-balance. You might want to subtly suggest, "Hey, kid, 
ever heard of 'shot selection?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, a shot looks like a bad shot to a lot of people, but if I see the 
rim . . . I'll shoot it," he said. "It's sort of a no-win situation, though. To 
some coaches, my shot selection might be, 'Wow.' But to my coaches, it's the 
way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Especially when there's no one else to go to. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Whitlock Loara's one-man show in scoring, his tremendous passing 
abilities are often wasted when his teammates can't hang onto the ball. 
</P>
<P>
During the Loara-Mater Dei game, some wise guy at the press table described the 
Saxons' team, outfitted in floppy red shorts, as "Tes Whitlock and the 
first-period P.E. class." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Prange nor Whitlock disputes that description. They only emphasize that 
other Loara players need to step up and help out -- now. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock, who lived through league records of 1-9 as a freshman, 2-8 as a 
sophomore and 4-6 as a junior, says he wants a trip to the playoffs more than 
anything, but not playing on a powerhouse team doesn't trouble him as it once 
did. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to really bother me," he said. "I mean, as a freshman and a sophomore, 
it was like, 'Geez, this is really stinky.' " 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock, who often calls players-only meetings, defends his teammates, 
pointing out many are just up from the junior varsity. "It's asking a lot from 
these guys to mature in a situation like the Tournament of Champions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Whitlock hopes for the best. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone would love to score 40 points a night but, shoot, I want to win 
games," he said.

NEWPORT SEX CONVICT SAYS THE LAW DID HIM WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a yacht broker, Daniel DeHaven had a reputation for honesty. He has raised 
four children and bought as many homes. 
</P>
<P>
His only scrape with the law was 48 years ago when, as a teen-ager, he went for 
a joy ride in a neighbor's car. Longtime friends say they have never known him 
to be violent or sexually aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
But in May, 1989, DeHaven was convicted of armed robbery, sexual battery and 
the attempted rape of a young woman in a dim Newport Beach parking garage. He 
served about six months in Huntington Beach City Jail and was released in 
August. But he has not walked away. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of friends, family and a veteran investigator from the Orange 
County public defender's office, DeHaven has launched a legal offensive to 
clear his name in a case with virtually no evidence against him except that 
based on the victim's word. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget the day the jury came back," DeHaven recalled. "I stood 
facing them and I told my lawyer they look grim. 'They sure do,' he said. The 
verdict was unanimous. I said over and over, 'How could they do this to me?' " 
</P>
<P>
Allegations of misconduct by Newport Beach police, including the planting of 
evidence and the improper influencing of the victim, have been lodged with the 
Orange County Grand Jury. Although grand jurors will neither confirm nor deny 
they have opened a case, John K. Depko, the public defender's investigator 
working with DeHaven, said he was told by the panel's secretary, Mary L. 
Hennessy, that the matter was pending as of last week. 
</P>
<P>
DeHaven is also seeking a new trial before the 4th District Court of Appeal, 
alleging a host of problems with the case. In March, the Orange County district 
attorney's office was presented with a detailed report. A lawsuit seeking $15 
million in damages for alleged civil rights violations is being prepared. 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether DeHaven, now 65, was mistakenly identified by the 
25-year-old victim, who tearfully testified during a day and a half on the 
witness stand that he accosted her at knifepoint almost two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Police and prosecutors steadfastly maintain that the retired yacht broker is 
guilty of the crime. Although they admit that mistakes were made by an officer 
assigned to the case, they say that investigators did a thorough job. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, the victim's "credibility was phenomenal," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
John Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"She was sure about it. It's twisted the way the defense is now trying to 
portray the inconsistencies in this case. They argued all this and the jurors 
listened to them and judged them. They simply said, 'We don't believe you.' " 
</P>
<P>
The evidence against DeHaven, then 62, was based almost solely on the 
statements of the victim, a Greek immigrant whom investigators noted had 
difficulty speaking English. 
</P>
<P>
She was attacked about 12:30 p.m. on Jan. 5, 1988, as she sat in her 1978 BMW 
320i in the dimly lighted parking garage of the South Oakwood Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, she remains sure that DeHaven was her attacker. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely, he is the one," she said in a telephone interview Saturday. "I 
have stayed locked in my house. I am afraid to go out sometime. I hear 
something behind me, I look over my shoulder. I saw him and what he did to me. 
He was in my car. I'm sure." 
</P>
<P>
But DeHaven has said from the beginning that he is innocent, and at his trial, 
two witnesses testified that they were having lunch with him at the time of the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
He and Depko maintain that he was convicted in part because police ignored 
their own policies and sound investigative techniques in making the case. 
</P>
<P>
Among their claims: 
</P>
<P>
* Police used questionable methods to attempt to link DeHaven to a home 
burglary that occurred shortly after the sexual assault. Depko said he found 
evidence of "repeated and calculated violations of normal police procedure" in 
what he believes was an attempt to discredit DeHaven. 
</P>
<P>
* An adequate fingerprint check of the vehicle in which the sexual attack 
occurred was never made. 
</P>
<P>
* Identification by a photograph of DeHaven in the sexual assault case was 
obtained in apparent violation of department procedure. 
</P>
<P>
* Investigators allegedly ignored contradictions between the victim's 
description of physical evidence and items obtained from DeHaven. 
</P>
<P>
"I have worked on 2,000 cases in my career and this is the only one where I 
feel the defendant is innocent," Depko said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy about the case first surfaced in the middle of DeHaven's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Papers from a burglarized apartment were found inside a gray jacket presented 
in court as evidence. According to police records, no such documents were ever 
reported to be inside DeHaven's jacket at the time of his arrest on Jan. 18, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
The records were a health insurance identification card, a credit card receipt 
and a temporary Texas driver's license belonging to Carey Lynn Baker, whose 
Newport Beach apartment was burglarized 10 days after the armed robbery and 
attempted rape. 
</P>
<P>
Two months before DeHaven's trial, Depko said, he thoroughly searched the 
jacket in the presence of police. According to his report, he did not find any 
documents belonging to Baker and was assured by police there was no more 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Depko said his suspicions of police misconduct were reinforced by Baker's 
description of the way police questioned her about the burglary. She told Depko 
that police tried to influence what she said and wanted her to pick out a 
picture of a suspect that clearly did not match the description of the man she 
saw in her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Depko's report, Baker said all the men police showed her in a 
photo folder, including DeHaven's picture, were too old. When she was told to 
pick one anyway, she chose someone other than DeHaven. Baker recalled that 
police then told her she had picked the wrong man. 
</P>
<P>
"In my 15 years in the criminal justice system, (the officer's) handling of 
this photo-lineup with Baker is the worst example of blatant attempts by police 
to change a witness's testimony," Depko wrote. "Had he succeeded in twisting 
Baker's memory, he may well have obtained the false identification of an 
innocent man." 
</P>
<P>
Depko contends that if Baker's documents were found during DeHaven's arrest, he 
should have been booked for investigation of burglary or possession of stolen 
property at the least. DeHaven was accused of neither. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Lt. Tim Newman, a police spokesman, said the Baker documents were 
in the jacket at the time of the arrest but not recorded because the papers 
were taken out to be photographed and then mistakenly placed in a separate 
evidence locker. Some time before DeHaven's trial, the documents were found and 
put back in the jacket. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the officer involved was disciplined for the error. 
</P>
<P>
"Our employee made a mistake and did not thoroughly describe all the evidence 
that was located," Newman said. "It was an error. We screwed up. . . . Steps 
were taken to make sure it doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Newman said that it was logical and proper for police to question Baker about 
DeHaven after his arrest because he lived in the area and there might have been 
some similarities with the suspect's description. He denied any impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
Police also have told the Orange County district attorney's office that Depko 
missed the documents in the jacket during his search and that DeHaven was 
questioned about the papers after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. John Conley, who talked to the police and reviewed Depko's 
detailed report, concluded that the prospect of planting evidence was remote. 
". . . Mistakes were made, but no deliberate wrongdoing occurred," Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
But Depko, DeHaven and his supporters contend that violations of Newport Beach 
police policies and indications of incompetence extend well beyond the Baker 
documents and into the heart of the criminal charges -- the victim's 
recollection. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it is very disturbing. When I read the case it caused a natural 
uneasiness," said Jack Earley, a private defense attorney who represented 
DeHaven for a while. "It is a very weak ID and he has about as strong an alibi 
as you can see. Wrong IDs can cause horrible injustices." 
</P>
<P>
Depko has raised questions about aspects of how DeHaven was identified -- 
procedures used when the victim spotted him in a shopping mall and the way she 
was subsequently shown a photograph of DeHaven at police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Records indicate that after the attack, Newport police received four reports 
from patrol officers, the victim and one of the victim's co-workers who thought 
they had spotted the suspect. One of them was a man with a "balding spot" and 
tan jacket. The victim, who became "very upset," was "positive" it was her 
assailant. DeHaven has no balding spot or tan jacket. 
</P>
<P>
DeHaven officially came into the picture while the victim was working at Atrium 
Court in Fashion Island on Jan. 18, 1988. Police were already in the shopping 
center, responding to the sighting of the man with the balding spot. 
</P>
<P>
While talking to a detective, the victim looked up, pointed out DeHaven on the 
second floor more than 100 feet away, and said, "My God, he's back! There he 
is!" According to a police report, she became visibly upset. 
</P>
<P>
DeHaven was arrested, but never taken any closer to the victim for inspection, 
Depko said, noting that proper field identifications are usually done from a 
few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the victim was shown only a photograph of DeHaven, which she identified 
as a picture of her attacker. 
</P>
<P>
The use of one photo is contrary to Newport Beach Police Department policies 
designed to prevent victims and witnesses from making biased and unreliable 
selections of suspects. Among other things, at least six photographs must be 
presented and they have to show similar-looking people, department rules state. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (police) would have shown her a full photo lineup, she probably would 
not have identified him," Depko said. "With only eyewitness testimony, you must 
be extremely scrupulous, but they ignored key contradictions." 
</P>
<P>
But Lt. Newman defends the procedure used by police by saying that there may 
not have been any need to show the victim a full photo lineup because she 
seemed certain about her attacker. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not an inappropriate police investigation. It was a good 
investigation and he was convicted," Newman said. "A person incarcerated for a 
crime they did not commit is a bad thing, but a woman assaulted in a parking 
lot is a bad thing too." 
</P>
<P>
However, Depko said other incongruities spring from the details of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Police records and court testimony indicate there are some similarities and 
differences between DeHaven and the assailant. DeHaven is the about the same 
size and has a mustache, as did the attacker, but did not have four to five 
days' growth of beard at the time of the attack. His jacket is the same light 
gray color as the victim originally said the attacker wore, but has black 
zippers on the sleeves and a different kind of cuff. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the difference between the knife the victim originally described 
being used in the attack and the one DeHaven was carrying the day he was 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The victim first described the weapon as a kitchen-type knife with a dark 
handle about 6 inches long. DeHaven, a yachtsman, carried a Buck pocketknife, 
which is about 7 inches long unfolded and has a handle of dark wood with brass 
fittings at each end and a piece of green tape around it. But when shown 
DeHaven's knife at the Police Department, investigators said, the victim 
identified it. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, the victim had "no doubt" about DeHaven's jacket 
and identified the knife when police showed it to her. Later, during a 
preliminary hearing, she said she remembered the knife exactly and recounted 
the tape, the brass fittings and that it folded. Her original description never 
included those details. 
</P>
<P>
Depko also noted in his review of the case that although the victim said the 
attacker touched the inside and outside of her car, police testified that they 
dusted only the outside of the vehicle for fingerprints and did not find any. 
Had the inside been checked, he said, DeHaven might have been eliminated as a 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office contends that all of the defense concerns were 
addressed at the trial during what the prosecutor described as "very thorough 
cross-examination." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't explain away all the coincidences. It is nonsense to isolate one 
piece of the evidence. It is the combined effect that can't be ignored," 
Anderson said. "It's the cleanest trial you can have -- plain old witness 
credibility. This victim will go to her grave 100% convinced that this guy 
attacked her." 
</P>
<P>
DeHaven's state-appointed attorney, Lawrence F. Salisbury, contends in his 
appeal, however, that the jury was improperly denied the testimony of 10 
character witnesses that when combined with other testimony would provide 
enough evidence to support an acquittal.

DANA PARSONS: DROPPING CHARGES AGAINST SHERIFF'S DEPT., D.A.'S OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DANA PARSONS

<TEXT>
<P>
On Sept. 11, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said no hate-crime charges would be 
filed in the Amber Jefferson case. The 15-year-old high school sophomore had 
already become something of a cause celebre, with some people claiming that an 
attack on her a month earlier had been racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
While not specifically criticizing the district attorney for not filing 
hate-crime charges (his office did file other charges against an alleged 
assailant), I knocked both Capizzi's office and the Sheriff's Department for 
doing a lousy job of handling the whole thing. I suggested that perception 
counts for a lot in potentially explosive cases and that they should have been 
more attuned to it from the beginning of the Amber Jefferson incident. 
</P>
<P>
With the trial for Amber's alleged attacker set for early next year, it's time 
to give some belated but well-deserved credit, especially to the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Assistant Sheriff Dennis LaDucer acknowledged to a Times reporter 
that the department fumbled the ball early in its handling of the case. While 
that remark is in itself a heartening sign of openness, it wasn't just a public 
relations comment -- it has been backed up by some concrete action. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning shortly after the Amber Jefferson incident, LaDucer and other 
Sheriff's Department officials met with representatives of the county's Human 
Relations Commission. Early on, according to Rusty Kennedy, the commission's 
executive director, LaDucer conceded the department could have handled the 
Jefferson case better. 
</P>
<P>
But from there, LaDucer went on to tell Kennedy the department wanted to form a 
policy for dealing with potential hate crimes. Having done just that with 
various police departments in the county -- but never with the Sheriff's 
Department -- Kennedy was only too happy to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy recalls: "Dennis drafted a procedure for handling hate crimes and sent 
it over to us for comment. Sending it to us for comment was not something they 
had ever done before. We made suggestions, and they implemented all the 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
Later on, Sheriff Brad Gates and about 20 of his top officials met with Kennedy 
and others and discussed hate crimes in general, even hashing over the Amber 
Jefferson case. "They were very receptive," Kennedy said. "They were very 
interested in knowing why we felt the Amber Jefferson case was a hate-related 
crime when their officer on the scene's best judgment was that other things 
motivated it. There was a learning process going on, but it was very amiable. 
They were very positive as to what they were hearing." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy explained that while the Jefferson case may not have been a hate crime 
in a strictly legal sense, other existing factors led him to consider it 
hate-related -- a position he still holds. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, shortly after that unprecedented meeting, the Laguna Hills home of 
the Delano De Silva family, which is black, was vandalized and spray-painted 
with racial epithets. A sheriff's deputy joined others at a press conference a 
few days later to decry the incident. Gates and Capizzi added separate 
condemnations. 
</P>
<P>
It was an excellent response, sending out a strong signal at a time when racial 
and ethnic incidents seem to happen too often. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Gates and Capizzi aren't going to help skinheads and pinheads find 
religion over race relations, but it's vital that they lend their substantial 
weight to condemning such things. For too long, this county has been portrayed 
as a haven for bigots -- a national reputation that diminishes all of us. 
</P>
<P>
The county is still wending its way along a path toward an increasingly diverse 
community. Along that path, other Amber Jeffersons and Delano De Silvas are 
bound to occur. In some instances, the degree of the hate crime will be obvious 
-- such as in the De Silva case -- or less clear -- as in the Jefferson case. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the public and press sometimes may make misjudgments about the 
role of racism or ethnic bigotry in any given case. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said he would never knowingly label something a hate crime that wasn't. 
However, he added: "It seems to me the worst scenario is if it's a hate crime 
and we refuse to acknowledge it and nobody looks into it and figures it out and 
we never do anything about it. And that's been the norm. If there are cases 
where we look at the evidence we learn from second-hand accounts from the 
newspapers and people who talk to us -- and if with that information we make 
some wrong judgments about whether things are racially motivated -- I don't 
think that's a major crime for inter-ethnic relations in the county, because 
many more (hate crimes) are going on that people aren't aware of." 
</P>

I-HATE-WHEN-THIS-HAPPENS: In last Sunday's column, I said Curt Pringle lost his 
bid for reelection in the 71st state Assembly District. As any child of 4

ARMORIES OPEN FOR HOMELESS AS TEMPERATURES FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prompted by chilly temperatures and the threat of rain, county officials opened 
the National Guard armories in Santa Ana and Fullerton to the homeless Saturday 
for the first time this winter. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, a dozen men and women were waiting in line outside the armory at 
612 E. Warner Ave. before the makeshift shelter had even opened its doors. 
Within the first hour, some 40 people from across Orange County had arrived for 
a hot meal of chili, a shower and a dry bed. Another 50 people converged on the 
temporary shelter in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The armories appeared to have plenty of room. Each could hold 100 or more cots, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those bedding down for the night in Santa Ana had been homeless for 
just a day. Others said they had been living on the streets for a decade. Many 
said they have been unable to make a steady living because of a history of 
mental illness, while some said they began to lose control of their lives after 
deaths in their families. 
</P>
<P>
"This sure beats sleeping out in the cold in a pickup truck," said Frank 
Wiercyski, 39, of Huntington Harbour, as he settled onto a green cot at the 
Santa Ana armory for the night. "I had been working day jobs but today I didn't 
get sent out, so here I am." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first trip ever to a homeless shelter for Wiercyski, who, in better 
times, worked as a sound and light technician for a motion picture studio 
before being suspended two years ago. He said he and his girlfriend had been 
trying to stretch his meager earnings from odd jobs by sleeping half the week 
in motels and the other half in his pickup truck, parked behind the YMCA on 
Sycamore Street in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Wiercyski said his life first took a turn for the worse two years ago when a 
security guard at work discovered him using drugs. He said he was suspended 
from his job and suddenly found himself unable to make a living. Last November, 
his mother and father died in an automobile accident, followed by the sudden 
death of his two children. 
</P>
<P>
"It all just got to me," he said. "Finally, I tried to shoot myself but my 
girlfriend wrestled the gun away from me and had me committed." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, dozens of men and women waited in line for shelter volunteers to heap 
spoonfuls of mashed potatoes, peas and fresh fruit on their plates. Brian 
Blanchard, 33, of Whittier, was one. 
</P>
<P>
Blanchard said he has lived on the street 10 years, most recently making his 
home in a vacant lot in Fullerton. He travels to Santa Ana regularly, he said, 
for the free feedings at various parks. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried living in shelters and stuff to keep me off the streets," he said, 
between mouthfuls of chili. "But none of that ever seemed to work because they 
have too many restrictions on what you can and can't do." 
</P>
<P>
Blanchard, who said he completed two years of college, has been unable to find 
steady work since 1979, when his mother remarried and his stepfather kicked him 
out of the house. Even if he were to find work, he said, he would not be able 
to afford an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Although dozens of people had arrived at the shelter by early evening, shelter 
officials said they had expected a larger turnout.

Fire officials Saturday were investigating as arson a spectacular fire that 
destroyed a vacant Cadillac dealership showroom in the city's redevelopment 
district and threatened to spread into the city's downtown Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
At least one suspect has been detained, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire is believed to have been started to cover up a burglary, an official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials did not identify the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters will remain on the scene through this morning to prevent any 
flare-ups. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out about 8 p.m. Friday in the large former showroom of the 
McLean Cadillac dealership in the 200 block of North Main Street, according to 
Fire Department spokeswoman Sharon Frank. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department received several calls about the blaze, and flames were 
shooting into the sky when the first units arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Under the command of Battalion Chief Tom Skelly, about 40 firefighters were 
assigned to the fight the blaze and to prevent it from spreading to the nearby 
historic downtown business district, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The large automobile showroom building -- which contained offices and once held 
a half dozen or more Cadillacs at a time -- is owned by the city of Santa Ana 
and is part of the redevelopment district. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was estimated at $600,000, Frank said.

RIGID DISCIPLINE STRAIGHTENS OUT EX-CONS; 
</P>
<P>
REHABILITATION: ANAHEIM'S CELEBRATE FREEDOM OUTREACH STRESSES RELIGION AND 
REGIMEN. NO ONE HAS RETURNED TO JAIL.

<TEXT>
<P>
Fourteen months ago in San Bernardino County Jail, Craig Hunton wanted to die. 
</P>
<P>
At 30, he had spent half of his life addicted to injections of methamphetamines 
and other drugs. His habit had cost him his wife, his three children, his home 
and several years of his life spent in prison. 
</P>
<P>
But now, after completing a religion-oriented rehabilitation program called 
Celebrate Freedom Outreach, he is helping a dozen other ex-convicts learn how 
to live. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came into this program, in October of last year, it was do or die," he 
said. "I realized I had lost everything, and my self-hatred was so strong I 
couldn't live with myself any longer. I was dead. I didn't want to live. With 
all these guys it was the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Created and run by Bob Roll, a former convict and drug addict, Freedom Outreach 
operates a home on North Bush Street, where convicts may live after they serve 
their sentences, or where judges can send criminals as an alternative to jail 
time. The program has also accepted substance abusers and homeless people with 
no criminal records, program spokesman Steven Haymer said. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve men share the four-bedroom Anaheim house, which has a pool and a 
weightlifting area in the back yard. Most of them come from county jails and 
prisons, Haymer said. Twelve other men have graduated from the program since it 
began in January, 1989. None have been returned to jail, and half have joined 
the program as staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Rigidly enforced discipline plays a large part in keeping the men, who refer to 
each other as "brothers," on track. They must rise by 6:30 a.m. for prayer and 
breakfast, go to work during the day and have lights out by 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at gradually making the men self-sufficient by getting 
them jobs and bank accounts. They are constantly monitored, and almost all of 
their time is spent either working or in religious study or prayer. Telephone 
calls and visits to the home are limited. 
</P>
<P>
"We operate in grace and love, but there are strict guidelines," said Hunton, 
who oversees the men. 
</P>
<P>
A sign posted on the living room wall warns that residents will be expelled if 
they violate the rules: no violence, no smoking, drinking, dating, radio or TV, 
no staying out at night. Although an outcast member may apply for readmittance 
after 30 days, he must persuade the staff that he will abide by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Bunk beds cram the rooms, with Bibles resting at the foot of most of them. 
"That's our sword. We couldn't live without it," Hunton said. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning at 6:30 a.m., the men shuffled one at a time into the 
kitchen and made breakfast of cereal and hot coffee. They greeted each other 
with "good morning, brother" as they dressed and shaved before a long day of 
selling Christmas trees at four lots around the county. 
</P>
<P>
In a room down the hall, Hunton had to rouse one straggler from bed, then make 
sure that Buck Druckenmiller, 20, had enough money for bus fare to make an 
appointment with his parole officer. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the average six-month stay, most of the men have jobs, while 
the others work at community service projects. But the three weeks before 
Christmas are devoted to selling Christmas trees to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Home Depot store in Fountain Valley, Jerry Sandoval, 45, and 
several other Outreach members operated a tree lot one afternoon recently. 
</P>
<P>
The dark scars on the inside of Sandoval's arms are testimony to his 30-year 
heroin addiction. The Stanton native said that if it was not for the program, 
"I'd be dead or drunk somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
"I gave up on seeing my family," he said. But as a result of the program, his 
parents and children have welcomed him back. And on a recent picnic with them, 
he was able to get acquainted with his grandson, whom he had not known. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Carolyn Forgey praised the program, saying it benefits 
everyone -- the Outreach members, their families and the public. 
</P>
<P>
"No question about it," she said. "If they redirect their lives, recidivism is 
controlled. If you get into the fiscal aspects, jail costs are reduced. And 
many of the individuals go on to help others recover. It has a good reputation 
in the court." 
</P>
<P>
She also said the program works because it focuses on every aspect of the 
individual's life, instead of singling out a specific problem. 
</P>
<P>
"They try an approach (working) with body, soul and spirit," Forgey said. "It 
works on all of the issues, not just the drugs. There's a real loving, 
supportive environment where healing can take place. They can establish their 
sense of self-worth and become productive citizens. " 
</P>
<P>
The $150,000-a-year operation is funded by local churches, fund-raising 
activities by Outreach and the county's general relief fund, program spokesman 
Haymer said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the organization, which was then based in Garden Grove, made enough 
money to open the home in Anaheim. The men moved to the Anaheim residence, and 
the Garden Grove home was used to house two women. 
</P>
<P>
Outreach plans to use the money made this year from the Christmas tree lots to 
open a 40-bed home on a 57-acre ranch near Stockton and eventually to branch 
out throughout the country, Haymer said. The organization needs about $150,000 
for a down payment on the $425,000 property, which organizers expect to raise 
within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, their lots were some of the busiest in Southern California, with 
more than $250,000 in business, raising $20,000 for the organization. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Hunton plans to continue his work for Outreach by preaching to inmates 
in the AIDS ward of the California Institution for Men in Chino. 
</P>
<P>
When he visits county jails and speaks to potential Outreach members, he offers 
himself as proof that the program works. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when I was out there in the (jail) chapel in the orange jumpsuit," 
he said. "Now I'm there -- and I can walk out. That's what this is about: 
setting the captives free."

SANTA ANA CLINIC SPANS CULTURAL CHASM TO REACH MENTALLY ILL LATINOS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: COUNTY-FUNDED CLINICA NUEVA ESPERANZA REACHES OUT TO A GROUP LONG 
ISOLATED BY THEIR LANGUAGE AND BACKGROUND.

<P>
When Josefina first came to the Clinica Nueva Esperanza, she was hooked on 
antidepressant drugs that she had bought over the counter in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Rosina McKay, her counselor at the only county-funded mental health clinic 
catering specifically to Spanish speakers, said she has seen the problem many 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times people don't know where to turn, so they go to Tijuana and get 
this medication that is way too strong for them," said McKay, who is from 
Mexico. "By the time they come to us, they have developed an addiction to the 
drug and their symptoms for depression are so severe. That's why Josefina came 
to us. We had to take her off that medicine before we could work with her. 
</P>
<P>
"We see that a lot among Latinos here." 
</P>
<P>
McKay and other clinic officials say the case of Josefina -- she requested that 
her last name not be used -- is just one example of why there is a need for a 
center that understands the unique concerns of low-income Spanish speakers 
suffering from severe mental problems. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is most private psychiatric help too expensive for most low-income 
Spanish speakers who suffer from severe mental problems, but health 
professionals versed in the Latino culture and the Spanish language are rare. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, convinced by the testimony of dozens of people that mental 
health care for low-income Latinos in the county was inadequate, the Board of 
Supervisors approved a 13% budget increase for the Clinica, an outpatient 
treatment center that provides bilingual counseling and medical care for 
sufferers of schizophrenia, depression and other advanced mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
Clinica officials say the new attention to the problem is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"The access to health care for Latinos in this county is minimal to none," said 
David Burciaga, executive director of the nonprofit center, which is under 
contract to the county. "And mental health care is even farther out of reach." 
</P>
<P>
The clinic, at 431 Bristol St., treats many people who are on medication to 
control their problems, and some have recently been released from mental 
hospitals. The need for more such services in the county is so great, says 
Clinica board member Maria Moreno, who is also a councilwoman in the city of 
Placentia, that she spearheaded an effort to open a satellite office to the 
Clinica in her city. Officials are still searching for a site, but they expect 
to open the small center in March with one part-time therapist. 
</P>
<P>
While serving 290 patients, the Santa Ana facility employs six therapists and 
seven part-time psychiatric residents from UC Irvine's psychiatric medicine 
department, in addition to a number of volunteer professionals. The clinic 
charges its patients on a sliding scale. 
</P>
<P>
Clinic officials say their bilingual staff members understand how culture and 
language contribute to the ability of someone to adjust to their jobs, marriage 
and schooling here. Central American refugees, for example, are more likely to 
suffer from depression, anxiety and feelings of hopelessness than the 
population in general, said Ana Deutch, supervisor of the therapists and other 
social workers at the Clinica. 
</P>
<P>
"They have gone through this traumatic experience," Deutch said. "They have 
been exposed to violence, they have been witnesses to the war. Their homes have 
been bombed, they have seen friends and family members massacred, husbands or 
wives or children. 
</P>
<P>
"People trying to deal with the problems of war -- that is a very new 
phenomenon in Orange County," said Deutch, a noted researcher on Latinos and 
mental health. "In Los Angeles County, mental health care agencies are more 
prepared to deal with that issue, but here in Orange County, we are just 
starting to see this problem in groups of certain Latinos moving here." 
</P>
<P>
The budget increase for the Clinica -- which also receives some funds from 
United Way -- comes at a time when mental health care throughout the county, 
and indeed, the state, is suffering from severe budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Barton, Orange County deputy mental health director, said the additional 
funds will be used mostly to try to improve salaries for the bilingual social 
workers who are difficult to find, and good ones difficult to keep. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone is a licensed clinical social worker and is both bilingual and 
bicultural, that individual is somewhat of a premium in this state," Barton 
said. "There are a lot of counties and other public and private agencies 
looking for individuals like that. We need to be able compete if we're going to 
serve Orange County communities." 
</P>
<P>
The clinic was founded when a group of Latino health care professionals in the 
early 1970s noticed a glaring need for specialists who understood the cultural 
differences of this growing population. Board member Rolando Castillo, an 
assistant clinical professor with UCI's department of medicine, and a native of 
El Salvador who was among the clinic's founders, said misdiagnoses of Latino 
patients were very common. 
</P>
<P>
"We noticed in our work that cultural differences were being viewed as 
pathological behavior by many professionals," he said. "Everyone became 
concerned. At that time, it was not OK to speak a different language, not OK to 
exhibit cultural differences." 
</P>
<P>
The new advocacy led to the creation of more community-based programs to make 
mental health care more accessible to people, such as Clinica Nueva Esperanza 
-- which means the clinic of new hope in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"I think one of (Clinica's) main features is that it is not just another mental 
health program in the community, but it recognizes language and culture," 
Castillo said. "It uses language and culture as therapeutic aspects. It's what 
we call the transcultural approach, which is taking the individuality of a 
patient's problems as they relate to their sociocultural background." 
</P>
<P>
About seven years ago, the county contracted with the Clinica to provide mental 
health care services for Latinos, something that the county had been trying to 
do with its own staff, but without much success. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the individuals are undocumented, and they were very apprehensive 
about going to any government agency for assistance," said Barton, the deputy 
mental health director. "We were just not as accessible and acceptable as we 
like to be. The Clinica, on the other hand, is really not seen by the community 
as tied to the government. So their staff is able to deal with individuals that 
otherwise would not come to us. It's got a real value that way." 
</P>
<P>
Under Burciaga, who was hired less than a year ago, the clinic has made several 
changes. Two months ago, it finalized an agreement with UC Irvine's psychiatric 
medicine department in which residents-in-training will provide part-time 
service to the center, which once relied mostly on peer counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Burciaga said that before the new arrangement, the clinic had the services of a 
psychiatrist about five to 11 hours a week, and a waiting list of about 200. 
With such little time to see so many people, he said, the doctor could do 
little but monitor clients' medication. 
</P>
<P>
The new arrangement will help the UCI residents as much as the clinic, he said, 
because they are being exposed to problems in a cultural setting they might not 
otherwise see, Burciaga said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not only important to know how to medicate a person, but also for the 
doctors to understand these different cultural values," he said. "Now we're 
looked at as a potential research center." 
</P>
<P>
Besides providing much-needed mental health counseling and supervision of 
medication, Burciaga said he also wants to provide educational programs that 
will familiarize more Latinos, and especially low-income Latinos, with the role 
of mental health care. 
</P>
<P>
McKay, the therapist, leads group therapy sessions in Spanish for women 
suffering from a number of problems, ranging from severe depression to 
addiction to marital difficulties. During one of the sessions, an older woman 
who did not want her name used and who suffers from depression, said she was 
grateful that the Clinica is there to serve her. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go to another hospital, they don't speak Spanish and they make you wait 
five hours for a translator, and they leave us until the end," she said. "Here, 
you feel so comfortable talking with Rosina because she understands us. She is 
like us."

SHOOTING VICTIM IN CRITICAL CONDITION

<TEXT>
<P>
A 26-year-old Corona man was shot several times in the head and upper body 
Saturday morning by an assailant who tried to rob him outside a commercial 
complex, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified by police as Eric Raymond Silva, was in critical 
condition late Saturday at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that they have no suspects in the 6 a.m. shooting and that Silva 
has been unable to provide a description. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lt. Ray Welch, Silva told police that he had just driven into the 
complex at 3650 E. Mira Loma Ave. when an unknown assailant tried to take his 
wallet, then shot him several times. Silva said he walked about 200 yards to 
the intersection of Tustin and Mira Loma avenues and flagged down a passing 
motorist for help. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know exactly why he (Silva) was there or any other information," 
Welch said. "He's in real critical condition, and our major concern was getting 
him help." 
</P>
<P>
He said there had been no previous reports of problems in the area.

JAMES FLANIGAN: WHY THE TREND TO DEFLATION IS ENCOURAGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two thoughts to guide you in these worrisome times: The economy's underlying 
dynamic is shifting from inflation to deflation and, realizing this, some of 
the nation's smartest investors are encouraged, not frightened. 
</P>
<P>
A big, off-putting word, deflation. Essentially, it means that in the 1990s the 
price of the farm will be less important than the size and price of the corn 
crop. 
</P>
<P>
To review and explain. Financial experts these days are like seismologists 
watching for an earthquake. Stock and bond traders -- and government officials 
-- seem to be waiting for problems in real estate to cause a spectacular bank 
failure, the collapse of an insurance firm, a chain reaction of financial 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Even their optimistic moments are ominous. When Security Pacific Bank last week 
set aside reserves against loan losses in Britain and Australia, the markets 
heaved a sigh of relief that California real estate was not specifically 
mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
That's grasping at straws. California office buildings are unlikely to be 
spared in the bust that is following the worldwide property boom of the 1980s. 
</P>

The United States has a 10-year surplus of office buildings, London's 
oversupply is even greater and Paris and Tokyo are still madly adding office 
space to saturated markets, says David Shulman, managing director and head of 
real estate research at Salomon Bros. investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
The boom was driven by inflationary expectations that a property built or 
purchased today would always be worth more tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Now the boom is over, and the fear is that buildings will decline in value, 
throwing loans into default, causing banks and other businesses to fail and the 
whole economy to spiral downward into a rerun of the 1930s Depression -- the 
last great era of asset deflation. 
</P>
<P>
But that is going too far, says Shulman. Sure, the new decade will be long and 
hard in real estate, with office buildings declining as much as 30% in value. 
But real estate can hurt without inflicting pain on the whole economy. "Office 
buildings are only 0.6% of the gross national product," he says. "It's a very 
large economy." 
</P>
<P>
And the real story today is how some very big and smart money is preparing to 
invest in that large economy. 
</P>
<P>
Warbug Pincus, a New York-based investment firm, has just raised $2 billion 
from its backers -- including the General Electric, General Motors and Pacific 
Telesis pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old firm is known for rescuing Mattel in 1983 with a $40-million 
equity investment, and making a $150-million investment in Pittsburgh's 
troubled Mellon Bank. Chairman Lionel Pincus is not frightened by today's 
changing economy. "We've lived through cycles before," he says, "and the 
pattern is familiar: shock, paralysis, despair, panic and then resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now between paralysis -- the credit crunch -- and despair," he says. So 
opportunities are emerging for his fund and others to recapitalize companies 
with equity investment. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore C. Rogers, who heads American Industrial Partners, a $200-million 
investment fund with backing from the Bank of America and Wells Fargo pension 
funds, among others, is looking to invest in manufacturing and industrial 
distribution companies. 
</P>
<P>
The fund brings operating expertise as well as cash to investments; Rogers is a 
former chairman of NL Industries and a longtime manufacturing executive. 
</P>
<P>
The new equity funds are the opposite of the 1980s' leveraged buyouts, which 
relied on the company's income or the sale of its assets to pay debt, leaving 
LBO backers with a valuable property they could sell. The assumptions 
underlying LBOs were that income would not fall, you could always sell assets 
and resale values would go up or at least not go down. 
</P>
<P>
None of those assumptions are valid in the changed economy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, there is a new way to create value -- increase the company's profits 
-- as American Industrial Partners' first deal illustrates perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers expects shortly to invest almost $12 million in two box-making companies 
in Northern California -- names undisclosed because the deal is not signed yet. 
</P>
<P>
The $12 million, which will represent 42% of the two firms' combined equity 
capital, will go for high-speed packaging and production lines and an ink plant 
to serve both companies. With the new machinery, American Partners hopes to 
increase profits from $1.3 million to $3 million within 18 months, and to earn 
their returns as the businesses grow from there. 
</P>
<P>
They don't plan to sell for five to seven years and, in fact, assume that the 
box companies' resale value at any time may be lower than it is today. But 
income will go up if the investments are made and the business is well managed. 
</P>
<P>
And that will be the pattern for business in the new decade, says Rogers. 
"You'll have to work the crop, not sell the farm." 
</P>
<P>
Which is enormously encouraging. The new decade will have a productive bias, 
not an inflationary one. In an inflationary time, you make a bet that value 
will increase; in a productive time, you make an effort to see that it does.

HOLLYWOOD SET TO HUNKER DOWN AS TIMES GET HARD; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: SOME ANALYSTS ARE QUESTIONING THE REPUTATION OF THE INDUSTRY FOR 
ECONOMIC RESILIENCE. THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW THAN IN PAST DOWNTURNS, THEY SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At least since the Great Depression, when Hollywood discovered that Americans 
would go to the movies even in the worst of times, the entertainment industry 
has enjoyed a reputation as an economically resilient business. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you are talking about cable TV, theatrical box office . . . or a 
Rolling Stones concert, entertainment seems to hold its own," said Dennis I. 
Forst, a senior entertainment analyst at Security Pacific Merchant Bank. 
"People always have a need to get away from reality." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood's reputation may endure -- and many financial experts besides Forst 
believe the industry is recession-resistant. But 61 years after Americans first 
became infatuated with the "talkies" that replaced old-fashioned silent 
pictures and catapulted the nascent film business into a multibillion-dollar 
enterprise, some observers are beginning to question the optimism that 
surrounds the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the entertainment industry has ever lived up to its reputation 
as being recession-resistant in terms of the economy having no impact on it at 
all," said David Wilkofsky, chairman of an economic consulting firm in New 
York. "Entertainment is an important basic staple of life . . . but I expect to 
see some declines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The big question this time around is whether the movie industry will be 
impacted by" new and cheaper forms of entertainment that didn't exist a decade 
ago, added David Wyss, research director for DRI-McGraw Hill, an economics 
consulting firm in Lexington, Mass. With cable TV and home video, he said, 
"movies are no longer the cheapest form of entertainment . . . and may be more 
affected by this recession than they have been in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Among those now evaluating their spending amid the looming recession are 
consumers like Los Angeles resident Sean Randle. 
</P>
<P>
Since losing his job as a stockbroker in June, Randle has cut back in on many 
forms of entertainment, including going out to concerts, buying recorded music 
and attending movies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't buy as much music or go out to movies like I used to," Randle said. 
"It's cheaper to entertain (guests) at home. They can kick off their shoes and 
watch a video and we can eat in." 
</P>
<P>
In 1929, when sound was introduced to movies, theaters had relatively little 
entertainment competition. What's more, movies were inexpensive and Americans 
flocked to them in such great numbers that the net profits of the major film 
studios jumped 100% or more within a year. But today, with theme parks, 
recorded music in several formats, cable TV, home video and video games all 
vying for consumers' disposable income, it's a lot more competitive in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the new competition -- cable TV, home video and video games, to name a 
few -- has emerged in the eight years since the last major recession. That's 
why some analysts say new diversions could pose a major challenge to 
traditional Hollywood: movies, music and theme parks. Figures from industry 
trade groups, for instance, show that even before competition intensified 
during the 1980s -- music, theme parks and, to a lesser extent, movies, had not 
fared well in economic downturns: 
</P>
<P>
* Movie attendance, defying the pummeling that most other industries took 
during the 1973-74 recession, jumped 16.9% in 1974, according to the Motion 
Picture Assn. of America. But in the 1980 slump, movie attendance fell 8.9%. In 
the 1981-82 recession, attendance rose 4.5% in 1981 and 10.2% in 1982, aided by 
hit movies such as "E.T." and "Raiders of the Lost Ark." But attendance is off 
8% this year despite hits such as "Ghost" and "Pretty Woman." Because of the 
mixed performance, some experts argue that the industry is recession-proof and 
that movie quality, not the economy, affects attendance the most. 
</P>
<P>
* Record sales fell 3.5%, 2.7%, 7% and 9%, respectively, in each calendar year 
of the last three recessions, says the Recording Industry Assn. of America. The 
impact of music quality is hard to measure. But many of music's biggest stars 
released records both during and after downturns yet appeared to sell less well 
in recessionary periods. Michael Jackson's "Off the Wall" album, released in 
1979, just before the 1980-81 recession, sold about 8 million copies worldwide 
through 1986, while his "Thriller" album, released as the 1982 recession ended, 
sold about 38 million copies through 1986. 
</P>
<P>
* Walt Disney Co., the nation's largest theme park operator, reported 
attendance declines in two of the last three recessions. Attendance declined 
5.6% in 1974. It was up 3.1% in 1980 but down 2.9% in 1981 and down 6.4% in 
1982. Disney says attendance was mostly hurt by oil shortages that existed 
during those periods. But Jeffrey Lodgson, an analyst with Seidler Amdec 
Securities, notes that while gas is now widely available -- albeit more 
expensive -- attendance has fallen at several theme parks in the last six 
months, including Disney, Knott's Berry Farm and Sea World. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the evidence that some sectors of the entertainment industry are 
negatively affected by economic downturns, cash has been thrown around 
Hollywood in recent months as if investors believe it is the only safe haven 
from bad times. 
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen well-financed record labels have been launched in the last 12 
years. Germany's Bertelsmann Music Group was the latest to enter the fray with 
the Imago Recording Co. label, launched Nov. 30 and backed by about $50 
million. The Japanese have invested more than $1 billion in various studio 
deals since January. And last month, the U.S. entertainment giant MCA Inc. 
agreed to be acquired by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. for $6.59 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the money has poured in, however, more and more entertainment companies 
find themselves hunkering down. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people have been laid off since the summer by A&amp;M, Island, 
Enigma and RCA records. In October, General Cinema Corp. announced layoffs and 
a cutback in theater construction. The 1,700-screen Cineplex Odeon theater 
chain reached agreement with its banks in late November to defer principal 
payments on loans until mid-1992. Another theater chain, AMC Entertainment, 
says it is also retrenching. Meanwhile, MGM-Pathe Communications has fired 
about 280 people since merging Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
General Cinema spokesman Peter Farwell attributed his company's difficulties to 
an overabundance of movie screens. But Disney, which leads all other studios in 
motion picture market share in 1990, traced its sluggish growth to the economic 
downturn. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Nov. 8, Disney said financial results for the three 
months ended Sept. 30 were "negatively impacted by the weakened domestic 
economic climate." 
</P>
<P>
Although the economic pressure seemed to most affect Disney's theme parks, 
analysts expected stronger film results, too. They noted that although the hit 
movie "Pretty Woman" did well this year, "Dick Tracy" has had trouble recouping 
its huge marketing costs. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, nearly a third of Disney's $104.6 million in fourth quarter operating 
profit for its filmed entertainment division came from the syndication of "The 
Golden Girls" television show and home video sales of "Peter Pan." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the shifting of the film unit's profit centers, the coming economic 
downturn could prove the most daunting yet. Escalating production, marketing 
and distribution costs have put pressure on entertainment companies to increase 
prices, and that could change the widespread perception that entertainment is a 
relative bargain compared to other expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
"In past recessions, the evidence indicated that people continued to go to the 
movies for the most part because it was a fairly inexpensive form of 
entertainment, but things have changed," said Nick Counter, president of the 
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. "We really won't know what 
will happen this recession until it comes. But the honest answer is that things 
could get rough." 
</P>
<P>
While consumers can subscribe to cable TV and rent home videos for as little as 
99 cents a day, movie tickets have risen from a nationwide average of $2.70 in 
1980 to $5. At an average price of $12.49, compact discs cost 100% more than 
LPs sold in 1980. In many metropolitan areas, such as Los Angeles, it can now 
cost as much as $7 for a movie ticket and $15 to $20 for some compact discs. 
The higher prices have given some consumers pause. 
</P>
<P>
"Entertainment would be one of the first things to go if I lost my job," said 
Tracy Pierson, a free-lance writer from Santa Monica. "You don't necessarily 
have to go to the movies or an expensive concert, especially when there are 
other forms of entertainment like home video. It's absurd to think that when 
someone's out of work they are going to go to the movies or buy music." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as the price of entertainment escalates, more and more "consumers may 
decide that entertainment is not a necessity," said Alan Levenson, an economist 
with WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Many consumers may choose home videos over movies during hard times, according 
to a nationwide survey of 7,000 families conducted by the Conference Board, a 
New York-based research organization. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers rate renting home videos a "good" value. But they say premium cable 
channels and movie tickets are "poor" values, along with auto insurance and 
lawyers' fees. Compact discs fared relatively poorly in the Conference Board 
survey, too. 
</P>
<P>
Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer research 
center and author of the study, said items deemed a poor value by consumers 
"are likely to be skipped over" when times are bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you get into a recession, there is a tremendous inclination for people to 
become more cautious in their spending," Linden said. The first things to go, 
he said, are "impulse shopping" and luxuries. Second to feel the pinch are what 
he called "postponeables" -- repairs or scheduled replacements that can be 
delayed. He included much entertainment fare in the latter category. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't let anybody kid you," Kelvin Anderson, owner of VIP Records in Long 
Beach, told a recent gathering of the National Assn. of Recording 
Merchandisers. "Things are terrible out there. People are hurting."

RATING THE ENTERPRISE ZONE; 
</P>
<P>
THESE PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS HAVE HAD MIXED SUCCESS. SOME WONDER IF THEY 
ARE WORTH THE EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a rough, graffiti-stained neighborhood south of downtown Los Angeles are two 
businessmen, Richard Breen and Lance Kluger, who are polar opposites when it 
comes to the merits of enterprise zones. 
</P>
<P>
Count Breen a supporter of these programs designed to boost investment and 
create jobs in poor areas. Breen used the plan to qualify for a low-interest 
government loan to expand his shipping business that might have otherwise moved 
to the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
"It worked," he said. "It was win-win" for himself and the city. 
</P>
<P>
Forget it, says Kluger. His experience with the enterprise zone became a costly 
fiasco for his family's clothing business after a city-sponsored development 
loan fell through. "We're sorry we ever met anyone from the city of Los 
Angeles," Kluger said. 
</P>
<P>
So it goes these days for enterprise zones in Los Angeles and elsewhere 
nationwide. The zones so far have been a mixed bag, with some successes but 
many failures, sparking doubts about whether these well-intentioned social 
experiments are worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Enterprise zones have taken over where urban renewal programs and the War on 
Poverty have left off. They are public-private partnerships to provide 
businesses in depressed areas with certain financial incentives, mainly tax 
breaks, if they hire the hard-core unemployed or expand their operations within 
the zone. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the private sector can be any more effective than 
government in cleaning up and reviving areas plagued by deep-seated social and 
economic problems. So far, true success has been rare. 
</P>
<P>
Enterprise zone advocates says these programs reduce welfare costs by hiring 
the unemployed, infuse declining neighborhoods with new investment and act as 
catalysts in forcing local officials to focus on development and employment 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the evidence to date indicates that enterprise zones do not have the 
firepower to make meaningful change in areas that need it most. They have yet 
to get federal backing despite a decade of effort. 
</P>
<P>
State-run zones have done little to improve inner-city neighborhoods like 
Watts, where unemployment, poor education, discrimination, apathy and crime are 
overwhelming problems. Hiring programs in these neighborhoods have met with 
little success, government officials concede. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me for an honest opinion if enterprise zones work in the inner 
city, I'd say no," said Juanita Tate, a community activist in South-Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Enterprise zones have also been criticized as unfair, inept and difficult to 
analyze. Government officials are often at a loss to quantify the effectiveness 
of their programs and how many jobs they have provided to those who most need 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the zones have worked in some industrial neighborhoods that still have a 
business base and in rural communities that have high unemployment rates 
without debilitating crime problems. Officials in Porterville and Madera in 
California's Central Valley say the enterprise zones have spurred their 
redevelopment efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has never passed a meaningful enterprise program because 
the zones, tagged "revenue losers," have been a low priority in a time of 
domestic spending restraints. Without federal backing, most of the state 
programs have never really taken off. 
</P>
<P>
"State taxes do not affect business decisions like federal taxes do," said Alan 
Eric Jones, head of the Evansville, Ind., zone. "With federal incentives some 
of these programs would take off like Roman candles." 
</P>
<P>
Enterprise zones were again eliminated from the most recent federal budget 
accord after being approved by the Republican and Democratic leadership in 
Congress. The program was eventually cut out because it was expected to cost 
the government more than $1 billion over four years. 
</P>
<P>
First embraced by former President Ronald Reagan, the zones are a favorite of 
Jack Kemp, secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The Bush Administration 
is expected to try again next year to pass a federal program. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts believe that even the best zones are doomed to limited success 
unless the federal government implements its own program. Currently 37 states 
have enacted their own programs since the early 1980s. California passed two 
separate, but similar, programs in 1984 that operate side by side. 
</P>
<P>
Though most state programs are said to be ineffectual, about a dozen appear to 
have made genuine, if modest, progress. The state of California, for example, 
boasts that enterprise zones produced more than 6,700 new jobs last year on 
total investments of $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
California has 19 zones statewide, including five in Los Angeles, with plans to 
add more. Others are located as far north as Eureka and as far south as 
Calexico. Seven are located in Central Valley cities, including Fresno and 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Though the zones attract little public attention, their merits have been 
fiercely debated in academia and government. Their cause was dealt a blow in 
1988 when the General Accounting Office, the watchdog arm of Congress, panned 
the enterprise zone program in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the enterprise zone concept received a major boost last year when a study 
by Marilyn Rubin, an associate professor at City University of New York, 
concluded that the enterprise zone program in New Jersey yielded the state a 
minimum of almost $2 in new taxes for every $1 spent. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the zones are successful, they are often viewed as unfair because they 
favor certain neighborhoods and cities over others. Cities usually compete 
fiercely to get the enterprise zone designation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always controversial," said S. Charles (Gary) Garofalo, who heads New 
Jersey's enterprise zone program. "You always have some cities saying: 'Why do 
they have this and we don't?' " 
</P>
<P>
The early evidence shows that the success of state-sponsored enterprise zones 
hinges on far more than financial incentives, such as tax breaks. Experts said 
the programs are only going to work well if local governments are adept and 
aggressive in marketing the zones to the business community and cutting through 
red tape at City Hall to facilitate development. 
</P>
<P>
"If you just declare the zone and say: 'Here are the tax breaks,' businesses 
will just yawn," said Michael Jenkins, head of the San Diego enterprise zone 
program. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most successful urban zones in California is located in southeast 
San Diego, a rundown but still viable neighborhood that is on the rebound, 
according to state and local officials. A new industrial park along Interstate 
15 is the crown jewel of the area's redevelopment effort. 
</P>
<P>
One businessman in the San Diego zone, Diego Aguilera, stands to reap a major 
windfall in tax relief because he recently purchased a new $200,000-press for 
his commercial printing business, located in a drug-plagued neighborhood not 
far from the Coronado Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The state sales tax that he paid on the press, about $14,000, can now be used 
as a credit against this year's income tax. Aguilera says he'll use the savings 
to buy added equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever set up the enterprise zone had a great idea," said the 56-year-old 
former newspaper pressman. 
</P>
<P>
The enterprise zones have helped to breathe new life into depressed parts of 
California's Central Valley, where unemployment is high and incomes are low. 
Second-tier cities there are scrambling to grow and diversify their tax base to 
reduce their dependence on agriculture, the traditional economic staple. 
</P>
<P>
Madera claims to have lured 13 major new businesses into its enterprise zone in 
the past year, setting off a construction boom in the sleepy town of 25,000 
people 25 miles north of Fresno. Among the new buildings in town is a 
$12-million distribution center built by Gottschalks, a department store chain. 
</P>
<P>
Porterville, a town of about 30,000 people nestled against the western edge of 
the Sierra Nevada mountains, about a three-hour drive north of Los Angeles, 
received a huge economic shot in the arm last year when Wal-Mart, another 
department store chain, chose to build a distribution center in the city's 
enterprise zone. 
</P>
<P>
The size of 22 football fields, the $30-million Wal-Mart facility is expected 
to employ at least 600 people and be the third-largest employer in town when it 
opens next year. "This is the biggest thing that has ever happened to 
Porterville," said City Manager C.G. Huffaker. 
</P>
<P>
What remains difficult to pinpoint -- and it's a problem in all zones -- is the 
exact role that the enterprise zone plays in luring new business to a depressed 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Though Wal-Mart stands to save millions of dollars in state taxes, company 
officials have indicated that the enterprise zone was a not primary factor in 
their decision. The most important considerations were the quality of 
Porterville's work force and its easy access to major highways, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly the nation's most successful enterprise zone is in Evansville, an Ohio 
River town of 130,000 people where about 4,000 new jobs have been created since 
its zone began in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
With able management and strong support at City Hall, the zone is credited with 
sparking a turnaround in Evansville's aging industrial sector that had been 
hard hit by plant closures in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
There are two enterprise zones in the back yard of downtown Los Angeles, and 
the results there have been mixed at best. One zone is in the Central City 
area, located just south of the Santa Monica Freeway, and the other is farther 
south in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
In Watts, enterprise zones have done little to attract new business or 
ameliorate deep-seated social and economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Watts is a tough sell," said Paul Hiller, head of the state zone program for 
the California Department of Commerce. "Outsiders know there are better places 
to set up shop." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Watts is worse off today than it was before its devastating riots 25 
years ago, claims Jasper Williams, a city official who recently took over as 
head of the Watts zone. "The disenchantment is more obvious and people have 
less hope today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, about 415 new jobs were created last year in the Central 
City enterprise zone, whose location makes it a natural business distribution 
point. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely a key element in what's happening," said Williams, who ran 
the Central City zone until recently. "But quite honestly, because of the 
location, a lot of this (business activity) would have happened anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders and government officials also concede that few of the new 
hires are the hard-core unemployed who need jobs the most. Hiring these 
applicants allows companies to qualify for tax credits, but successes are few. 
</P>
<P>
Drug problems disqualify some applicants and most of those hired do not last 
long in the tough entry-level jobs that require heavy manual labor, businessmen 
and government officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"If all you have been doing is sitting around and watching Oprah Winfrey, that 
(heavy) lifting gets old fast," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
A major setback in the Los Angeles zone program occurred last year in what 
became a nightmare for Lance and Ben Kluger, a son-and-father team whose 
clothing business bearing their name has been a fixture in the Central City for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
The Klugers were to be pioneers in a city-sponsored industrial bond program 
that was highly touted by Mayor Tom Bradley at a press conference as a way to 
help business expand within the Los Angeles zones. 
</P>
<P>
The Klugers were perfect: successful and stable. And they planned to use the 
low-interest bond fund to finance a new manufacturing facility on 29th St. The 
$7-million complex was to provide 200 new jobs and cut short the Klugers' plans 
to move their operations from the Central City to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Bradley's press conference, disaster struck. A European bank, 
Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN), unexpectedly withdrew its commitment to provide 
a letter of credit that was a key ingredient in implementing the $6.25-million 
bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
Without the letter of credit, the sale fell apart, leaving the Klugers without 
permanent financing. Most painfully, they lost a good-faith deposit of $62,500 
that was part of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The Klugers eventually got half their deposit back, but have sued the city of 
Los Angeles and ABN to get the remaining amount. As a postscript, they went 
ahead with their expansion using private lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Berkowitz, head of the city's private-placement bond program, termed the 
Klugers' case "unfortunate," adding "this is not the message we want to be 
sending out to the business community." ABN, which Berkowitz blamed for the 
snafu, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The major success story in the Central City zone is widely acknowledged to be 
Richard Breen, who was persuaded to expand his shipping operations on Hooper 
Street. With a $1.35-million low-interest loan from the city, Breen turned an 
adjacent junk yard into a loading dock rather than move his entire business, 
known as Daylight Transport, to the City of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The move saved the city close to 100 jobs and meant an additional investment of 
more than $5 million into a struggling but still viable commercial district 
that has about 2,500 businesses and a population of more than 45,000. 
</P>
<P>
Breen has few illusions about doing business in the inner city. Crime is a 
continual problem around his guarded, fenced-in compound, which he likens to a 
"fortress in Indian territory." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, murder victims appear outside the compound on nearby railroad 
tracks and gang violence is always a fear. On one occasion, Breen said, a 
Daylight Transport sentry was menaced and surrounded by gang members after he 
foiled their robbery attempt of a woman near his guard station. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrived and made arrests, but some gang members vowed revenge, Breen 
said. "Their last words were: 'We'll be back,' " he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Respected by local community figures, Breen is a former social worker in New 
York City and a one-time "hippie" who turned trucking entrepreneur after 
trekking to California in the mid-1970s. A wealthy man now, he says the only 
solutions to cleaning up the neighborhood are new jobs and viable businesses 
that will retake the area "block by block." 
</P>
<P>
"Social programs don't work, but private enterprise will," he said. "I know. 
I've seen it from both sides." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ENTERPRISE ZONES AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
* What: Enterprise zones are state-designated economic areas that offer tax 
breaks and other incentives to businesses if they expand their operations 
within the zone or relocate there. 
</P>
<P>
* Why: To create new jobs by encouraging private investment in poor areas. 
</P>
<P>
* Where: Located in 37 states nationwide, including California. There are 19 
enterprise zones statwide, including five in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Enclosed is a copy of a $1,000 note from the Bank of the United States in 
Philadelphia that was given to my father in 1925 as partial payment of a debt. 
It is dated 1840. Upon his death in 1987, it was discovered in a photo album. I 
am wondering if it might have any value. -- Upland 
</P>
<P>
A: It is worthless as a note but might be worth something to a collector. But 
collectors would be interested only if it is authentic and not one of thousands 
of fakes sent out in the 1950s as promotional material. The fakes are printed 
on parchment paper; the real thing was printed on heavy white paper. 
</P>
<P>
Because you say your father received the note in 1925, let's assume that it 
isn't one of the 1950s replicas. 
</P>
<P>
Although the name Bank of the United States may have sounded very official and 
governmental, it was really just another bank. According to a pamphlet put out 
by the Pennsylvania Bankers Assn., there were two different banks that called 
themselves the Bank of the United States. One closed in 1811. The other -- 
after switching to a state charter -- collapsed in 1841. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Biddle, the second bank's president from 1823 to 1839, was brought to 
trial for mismanagement but acquitted. It was charged that many of the bank's 
assets were of questionable value. (Sounds like today, doesn't it?) Biddle died 
"heartbroken" in 1844, according to the association. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of this bank eventually led to the setting up of the Federal 
Reserve System. 
</P>
<P>
Your note obviously became worthless as a note when the bank collapsed in the 
1800s, because these things weren't insured. The note might be worth $250 to 
$300 to a collector -- but only if Biddle signed it. 
</P>
<P>
There are two problems with this. Biddle tended to sign in an acidic ink, so 
few of his signatures survive. And because Biddle quit the bank in 1839, and 
your note is dated 1840, he would have had to sneak back into his old office to 
sign it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have 100 shares of Rose Marie Reid stock from my late mother's estate. 
Rose Marie Reid has apparently been acquired by some company, because I see the 
name on tags of bathing suits each spring in the department stores. Could you 
find out who bought Rose Marie Reid and what this stock is worth? -- Thousand 
Oaks 
</P>
<P>
A: Rose Marie Reid went out of business in August, 1965. The next month all of 
its properties were repossessed and sold for non-payment of taxes. The stock is 
worthless, according to R. M. Smythe &amp; Co., which tracks down long-lost 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Now, let's look into that bathing suit. Jonathan Logan, another apparel firm, 
had a licensing agreement with Rose Marie Reid in the 1960s. It got the rights 
to the Rose Marie Reid name, although nobody at Jonathan Logan is quite sure 
how this all came about. Jonathan Logan was later acquired by United Merchants 
&amp; Manufacturers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In cleaning out my late father's papers, I came across a 1923 German 
Treasurer Exchequer Bond with coupons maturing between March 1, 1924, and Sept. 
1, 1927. I suspect that the events that occurred in Germany during this period 
negated collectibility of the bond. However, I am wondering if the United 
States after World War II might have entered into any agreement with Germany 
for honoring claims of bondholders during this period. -- Bethlehem, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
A: Haley Garrison, head of Antique Stocks and Bonds in Williamsburg, Va., says 
the bonds you hold are worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison says 1923 was the year that Germany, devastated by skyrocketing 
inflation, printed these bonds aplenty. "Immigrants brought truckloads of this 
stuff in hopes that it might someday be redeemed," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
But the bonds weren't redeemed then, and they aren't worth anything today. You 
can contact Garrison at (800) 451-4504 if you'd like more information. JOHN

MARKETS / JOHN CRUDELE: ECONOMY WORRIES INVESTORS MORE THAN MIDEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The battle lines are now drawn for the stock market. It's the economy versus 
the Middle East. And the economy is the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index has rise nicely for the past several weeks, 
mainly because tensions in the Persian Gulf seem to have abated. But if you 
listened carefully, Wall Street gave off some very ominous noises. 
</P>
<P>
Take a look at how the overall stock market performed. And then take a look at 
the action of, say, IBM Corp.'s shares on one recent day. In those two 
instances, you'll see a conflict between what will probably be the two most 
powerful forces in the market during the next few months: the Middle East and 
the nation's weak economy. 
</P>
<P>
And Wall Street seems to be deciding that the economy's problems are too 
troublesome to ignore, even if the Middle East settles down. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices started out sharply higher, for instance, on Dec. 6, the day that 
Iraq first made gestures toward releasing foreign hostages. For the first time 
in months, there was a bona fide reason to believe that war could be avoided in 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
But stocks lost all of those early gains, and then some, mainly because 
investors became spooked about IBM's earnings. IBM shares, which have been on a 
winning streak of late, ended that day sharply lower and dragged down the rest 
of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Even more troublesome, some experts say, was the fact that there was no bad 
news about IBM's earnings -- only rumors. 
</P>
<P>
In its reaction to the IBM rumor, some experts think that the stock market was 
clearly showing a bias toward corporate profits and the economy as the most 
important issues for the remainder of 1990 and into January. Easing tensions in 
the Middle East -- although a good excuse for an occasional short-term rally -- 
aren't enough to boost share prices much more over the longer term. 
</P>
<P>
These experts believe that any extended rally for the stock market will 
probably be delayed until lower oil prices, lower interest rates or something 
else starts to have a noticeable effect on reviving the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate earnings are expected to be lousy in the current quarter. And news 
like that doesn't often wait to be announced. So stock prices are likely to be 
under pressure from economic factors well before companies start officially 
reporting their earnings in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board has sliced interest rates during the past few weeks, 
and a drop in the nation's discount rate could come any day. The Fed even took 
the extremely bold step of reducing the percentage of certain deposits that 
banks must hold as reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Although this last move could boost bank profits (perhaps by $1 billion for 
money center banks), the real question is: Will it succeed in the intended 
purpose of stimulating lending? "I have spoken to maybe 100 banks, and the 
answer is no," says Hugh Johnson, a stock market strategist for First Albany 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Even if banks decide to lend money more freely, the other big unknown is 
whether consumers and corporations are willing to borrow. Corporate debt has 
soared through the 1980s, and most experts believe that companies won't be too 
eager to borrow money while business conditions are still weak. 
</P>
<P>
And consumers, says Albert Sindlinger, a pollster, won't take out loans just 
yet. "Consumers are not in a borrowing mood," he says. "I don't think consumers 
are interested in adding to their debt." 
</P>
<P>
If consumers and business don't borrow and banks don't lend, the nation's 
economy will continue to slip. And although the headline writers on the 
business pages won't completely ignore the Middle East situation, more 
attention will be paid to the economy. And that probably won't cheer up the 
stock market. 
</P>

Broker Wins Slander Claim Against Client 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows what went through Freddie Klough's mind in late 1987, when he 
refused to pay Advest Inc. the $46,786 that the brokerage says he owed on his 
margin account. Perhaps he, like thousands of other American investors, simply 
felt cheated when his huge paper profits in the stock market turned to losses 
within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Klough -- not his real name -- did refuse to come up with the 
money, and he, like many investors at the time, complained about the way his 
accounts were handled by Advest. The Klough case has since become one of the 
most extraordinary arbitration cases between an investor and a brokerage that 
anyone can remember. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after crawling its way for three years through the courts and the New York 
Stock Exchange's arbitration process, this unusual case is finally complete. 
The verdict: Not only did Klough end up paying the $46,786 to Advest, but this 
month he was also ordered to give an additional $189,000 in punitive damages to 
George Guttman, an Advest broker. Guttman, in a counterclaim to the 
arbitrators, said Klough's complaints were libelous and slanderous and had 
deprived him of his livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying facts of Klough's case are straightforward -- as most 
arbitrations are. Klough, through broker Guttman, made many dozens of trades 
during 1987 and before. He purchased numerous different stocks and "shorted" 
many others. Put and call options were also purchased in his own account and in 
his 90-year-old mother's account, which Klough supervised. 
</P>
<P>
When the market collapsed and his accounts were picked clean, Klough contended 
that he hadn't known what was going on. He alleged that Guttman churned the 
accounts -- making unnecessary trades to generate more commissions. After 
complaining directly to Hartford, Conn.-based Advest, Klough said he didn't owe 
the brokerage anything. 
</P>
<P>
Advest and Guttman, on the other hand, argued that Klough was an experienced 
investor who should have known the risks involved in the trading tactics that 
were being undertaken. And the broker and his firm maintained that they were 
unaware of the age of Klough's mother because Klough withheld the information. 
</P>
<P>
Those sorts of facts would usually add up to a routine arbitration case. The 
panel would ordinarily decide whether Advest adhered to the "know-your-client" 
rule of thumb and allowed Klough to engage only in trading that was appropriate 
for him. If it were appropriate, Klough would have to pay the money. If it 
weren't, Advest would have to eat the loss. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a twist to this case: Guttman, who left Advest after Klough's 
accusations, charged that his former client had ruined his ability to work in 
the brokerage industry. For that, Guttman told the arbitration panel, he wanted 
Klough to pay. 
</P>
<P>
And Guttman got his revenge. In the next few weeks, Guttman's attorney will 
probably collect the $189,000 that the arbitration panel awarded the broker 
many months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The broker part of it, yeah, it was unusual," says Jeffrey More, a lawyer for 
Coleman &amp; Rhine, which represented Advest -- but not Guttman -- in the 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
Most investors unknowingly give up their right to sue a brokerage in court when 
they fill out those forms opening an account. Instead, they agree to have 
disputes settled in front of an arbitration panel, such as the three-member one 
that heard Klough's complaint against Advest. 
</P>
<P>
The arbitration process is usually relatively simple. An investor fills out 
some forms, telling the arbitrators his complaint. A hearing is set, during 
which both sides present their evidence. After a few months, the arbitrators 
decide who's right and who's wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But Klough's case consumed nine days of hearings, during which minute details 
of trading in Klough's accounts were examined. Klough himself spent 10 hours 
under cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
According to the best available information, Klough has been devastated by the 
arbitrators' decision, as well as by the recent death of his mother. I changed 
his name -- but not the names of the other participants -- to spare the 
investor more hardship while still being able to tell about this unusual case. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Klough did not respond to a regular letter I sent him, and he 
didn't accept a letter sent by certified mail. He is said to have shut off his 
telephone (as well as some other utilities to his New York City apartment), and 
he didn't respond to several telephone messages left with the management of his 
building. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad case," says Charles Hecht, a lawyer who represented Klough until he 
resigned halfway through the case. "He got a raw deal. But to an extent, he 
brought a lot of it on himself." 
</P>
<P>
Hecht, the second lawyer on the case, says he quit because of "irreconcilable 
differences" with his client. He wouldn't give details, citing attorney-client 
privileges. Klough, who has legal experience but isn't a lawyer, handled the 
case himself after Hecht's departure. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the facts go and how this guy was treated, it was an outrage," says 
Hecht, who still contends that Klough's account and that of his mother were 
traded "irrationally." 
</P>
<P>
Klough spent days on the stand trying to persuade arbitrators that he was a 
novice in the ways of stock trading -- even though he had an account as early 
as 1983 with Muriel Siebert &amp; Co., a small brokerage whose clients make 
most of their own investment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he said he wanted his family's funds invested in safe, blue chip 
stocks with good earnings, Klough's first foray into risky options trades 
occurred in 1983, according to testimony. By 1986, Klough was taking tax 
deductions for investment publications, but he claimed not to understand the 
concept of a "short squeeze" when shares of the Korean Fund suddenly started 
collapsing that year. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1987 crash, Klough purchased E. F. Hutton &amp; Co. stock because he 
hoped that the brokerage would be taken over. But Klough told the arbitrators 
that he would not have bought the shares if he thought they would go down in 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the arbitrators ruled against him and ordered him to pay Advest the 
money. But the most surprising aspect of the case to many observers is that the 
panel also ruled that the accusations that Klough made to Advest against 
Guttman had harmed the broker. Advest contends that Guttman wasn't fired; 
Guttman says he was. 
</P>
<P>
Were these accusations -- which were actually contained initially in a letter 
from Klough's first lawyer to Advest -- any more damaging to the broker than, 
say, the complaints a customer would make to Sears Roebuck about a testy 
refrigerator salesman? 
</P>
<P>
Members of the panel were not available for comment but obviously thought that 
Klough was wrong. The NYSE says the panelists are not permitted to discuss 
their findings. 
</P>
<P>
Guttman's lawyer says that because any complaint against a broker goes on a 
permanent record and affects his ability to get a job, the differences between 
these and other types of consumer complaints are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
Mark J. Astarita, a partner in Gusrae Kaplan &amp; Bruno, the firm that 
represented Guttman, says Klough threatened Guttman. "He made good on those 
threats by incessant letter writing and telephone calls to Advest and 
regulatory authorities, and by filing one of the most baseless claims I have 
ever seen filed," says Astarita. Guttman hasn't been able to find work in the 
brokerage industry for three years, his attorney says. 
</P>
<P>
"The customer had managed his own accounts and his mother's accounts for years 
at a discount broker with great success," says Astarita. Only when the market 
turned against him did Klough decide to complain about Guttman. 
</P>
<P>
Astarita adds that Guttman was merely an order taker. "You can't go around 
making unsubstantiated claims against a broker or anyone else for that matter," 
says Astarita. That's why Guttman filed a counterclaim, the lawyer says. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, it was the only counterclaim won against a customer by a broker 
that we were aware of," adds Astarita.

WHAT NOW, FOR WORLD COMMERCE, AFTER GATT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the breakdown of world trade negotiations last week, hopes for a more open 
world economy have faded, at least for now. The Uruguay round of talks on the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was supposed to complete an agreement to 
break down trade barriers in farming, services, textiles and other goods, with 
benefits to flow to developed and less-developed nations alike. 
</P>
<P>
 But talks broke down in part because of the European Community's refusal to 
significantly lower farm subsidies. Now there is a question as to whether GATT 
itself can survive. 
</P>
<P>
 For views on the future of world trade amid the collapse of the GATT talks, 
Sharon Bernstein interviewed Sebastian Edwards, professor of business economics 
at UCLA's Anderson School of Management and a specialist in South American and 
Latin American economies, and Bill Lewis, a principal in the McKinsey &amp; Co. 
management consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that there will be no world trade agreement like that sought in the 
GATT talks, what will international commerce look like in the coming years? 
</P>
<P>
Lewis: At first, the new direction would be towards curtailing the growth rate 
of world trade and, if things deteriorate enough, we will actually have a 
contraction in trade as we had back in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
The world's economies had been heading towards liberalization. If that 
direction changes, the impact would be different among different economies, 
with unfortunately the strongest impact on countries potentially in a period of 
very rapid economic development -- such as Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile. 
</P>
<P>
Then, secondly, it will impact both Europe and Japan, which depend on trade 
more heavily than the United States and also don't have as large or as 
homogenous or as integrated a market as the United States. The United States 
would also be affected, because to the extent that barriers are put up against 
the export of our skills -- or to the extent we retaliate and prevent the 
import of products or skills into the U.S. economy -- then U.S. consumers and 
U.S. corporations will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards: The poor countries will be reluctant to protect intellectual property 
and open their economic systems to us. At the same time the developing 
countries will find that they can't compete in terms of agricultural goods. 
</P>
<P>
Are there any major trading blocs on the horizon? 
</P>
<P>
Lewis: The obvious trading bloc that everybody thinks about is Europe itself. 
There is also potential for an Americas trading bloc, if world trade 
deteriorates to the point where Europe and Japan and the United States end up 
setting up barriers. An Asian bloc is harder to see, in part because of 
fragmentation and also for political, historical and cultural differences 
across the region. 
</P>
<P>
Do regional trading blocs present potential problems? 
</P>
<P>
Lewis: There's nothing wrong with blocs, they're just clearly a sub-optimum 
solution to open trade worldwide. The volume of trade among the potential blocs 
is about the same as the volume of trade within the blocs. What that implies is 
that trade among the blocs is very, very important, and to the extent that it 
is constrained, worldwide efficiency is diminished. There is, however, the 
concern that . . . the economic blocs could evolve into political blocs, with 
political disputes arising. 
</P>
<P>
What role is likely for developing countries? 
</P>
<P>
Lewis: The breakdown of the GATT talks will make it more difficult for them to 
generate the export performance they need to pay off their existing foreign 
debt and demonstrate their credit-worthiness for additional debt. It could also 
spill over into the political sphere, because it could make it more difficult 
for democratic forces that are aligning their destinies with market economies. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards: The talks broke down just at a point when many developing countries, 
especially those that have been hit very hard by the debt crisis, have decided 
to open up their international trade and abandon protectionism and move toward 
freer trade. In particular, it may hurt Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think they will reverse their policies. But what we will see is that 
the much needed recovery in South America and Latin America is going to be 
delayed and it's not going to be as vigorous or as strong as it would have been 
in a more open trade climate. It means we will see some social unrest in these 
countries, and we may see some political problems. 
</P>
<P>
What is the future for agricultural trade? 
</P>
<P>
Lewis: It just means that European housewives and taxpayers are going to 
continue to pay extraordinarily high prices for food, and especially developing 
countries are going to be able to export less in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards: The European countries are going to continue to protect their own 
agriculture. At a very high cost for their own consumers, it's also going to 
hurt North Africa, the United States, New Zealand, Australia and South America. 
</P>
<P>
What is the likely future for international trade in services, such as banking 
and insurance? 
</P>
<P>
Edwards: Instead of having an automatic and broad-based agreement, we will have 
to rely on bilateral negotiations, which are more cumbersome, costly and much 
more complicated. We have been successful in these kinds of negotiations with 
Korea, but it has been a very, very long and costly negotiating process. 
</P>
<P>
There will continue to be a fragmentation between the industrial countries, 
where banking and insurance is pretty much integrated, and the less developed 
countries, where there are a number of barriers for the international banks and 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
The United States would not be able to come in and do business in these other 
countries as much as we would like to. We will be able to participate less 
actively in the world trade of those areas where we have efficiency, such as 
banking and insurance. That means that the trade deficit will probably be 
larger and the economy as a whole is going to grow more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
What should the United States do to improve its role in international trade? 
</P>
<P>
Lewis: The biggest problem of other countries being protectionist is that it 
engenders retaliation on our part, which penalizes us because it denies access 
of our consumers to the best skills in the world. On the other hand, that 
retaliation is what it takes to get liberalized trading policies and the 
lowering of barriers. . . . It just may be that we're in a stage where it's 
going to take retaliation for us to get the message across. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards: I think that there are a number of areas -- textiles, for example -- 
where we should revise our quotas and allow more goods to come in. There is 
also the issue of manufactured goods from Korea and Japan that one way or 
another we try to keep out. We should open up and by so doing encourage 
efficiency.

QUAKE ALERT: 439 BUILDINGS RATED UNSAFE; 
</P>
<P>
BUT NONE OF THE COUNTY'S CITIES HAVE ADOPTED LAWS FOR PRE-1935 STRUCTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Beneath the charming facades of the historic brick buildings in the downtown 
areas of Ventura County lies a hidden potential for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
According to state standards, 439 buildings in eight of the county's 10 cities 
are considered unsafe to be inside or near during a major earthquake, which 
scientists say is inevitable in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
With no steel bars to reinforce walls, no anchors to hold the walls to the 
roofs or to the foundations, the bricks can shift and crumble onto city 
sidewalks and people. 
</P>
<P>
Building officials cite as examples the massive damage caused by the October, 
1989, earthquake in Santa Cruz and Watsonville, cities similar in construction 
and geology to those in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
To date, however, no cities in Ventura County have enacted ordinances that 
require property owners to retrofit their buildings built before 1935 to meet 
current safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Ventura, the county seat, has the most unreinforced brick buildings 
in the county. Among the 145 buildings of unreinforced masonry are the Ventura 
Mission and Holy Cross School, where 200 children attend Mass and classes 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Church intends to bring the two historic buildings up to safety 
standards as soon as the city of Ventura passes an ordinance requiring the 
improvements, Msgr. Patrick J. O'Brien said. But the church has no money to do 
the work now or after an ordinance is passed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are people of faith," O'Brien said. "People do come through for us when 
there is a real need." 
</P>
<P>
Everett Millais, Ventura's director of community development, said the city 
should help its property owners improve their buildings as soon as possible to 
save lives and businesses. He hopes the city will have an ordinance in place by 
April. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who looks at what happened to downtown Santa Cruz or Watsonville can 
see what we need to do," he said. "We all want to do what we can to see that 
when the earthquake does happen, we don't end up with a roped-off downtown 
where we have to go in and bulldoze the buildings." 
</P>
<P>
The city is waiting until it sees the results of a study by an outside 
consultant before it develops an ordinance. Those results are due to be 
completed next month. 
</P>
<P>
The study will recommend the level of repairs that the buildings need and 
whether they can still be economically viable after expensive repairs. Millais 
said many of the buildings that are long and narrow might not pass the economic 
test. 
</P>
<P>
Those buildings, such as the one that houses Hess Hardware, need upgrades but 
cannot command high rents to pay for the work. Some buildings might eventually 
have to be razed, as owners walk away from their unprofitable investments, 
Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
Hess Hardware owner Daniel A. McKenzie said he hopes the day an ordinance is 
passed never arrives. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the owner doesn't do any upgrades," said McKenzie, who for 45 years has 
leased the small store space where buyers can find everything from nails to 
nutcrackers. "If he does, we're out. The cost would be so great that the rent 
would go up and we couldn't stand it." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's earthquake study comes on the heels of evidence that Ventura County 
might be at greater risk for major earthquakes than previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month scientists meeting in San Francisco uncovered evidence of a 
fault off the coast of California that could cause an earthquake of the 
magnitude of 7. 
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, scientists revealed that information from new space 
technology confirmed previous findings that two Ventura County mountain ranges 
are converging rapidly in geological time, increasing the likelihood of a major 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
But the information has not spurred enough action in Ventura County, said Jack 
DeJong, a consultant hired by Fillmore and Ojai to advise the cities on 
earthquake problems. 
</P>
<P>
"From a safety standpoint, it is not wise to wait," said DeJong, who has 
studied all the cities in the county. "But from an economic point of view, I 
can understand the people's hesitancy to do anything about their buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula has a voluntary ordinance, which asks the owners of 120 unsafe 
buildings to fix their properties. But the absence of a requirement together 
with the city's lack of financial help for business owners renders the 
ordinance almost ineffective, DeJong said. 
</P>
<P>
He said people outside the affected area tend to forget the impacts of an 
earthquake a few months after it happens. "The economics are such that if they 
are not forced to upgrade their buildings, they are not going to do it," DeJong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Fillmore, 64 downtown buildings are unreinforced, but the city is waiting to 
see how Ventura handles its ordinance, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard, with 53 unreinforced masonry buildings, should have an ordinance by 
mid-1992 that requires upgrades and provides city redevelopment money for 
low-interest loans, city officials there said. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo, with 37 hazardous buildings, contracts with Ventura County's 
Building and Safety Department for service and falls under its guidelines. The 
county has not yet required improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai is the only city that has made real progress, DeJong said. The city is 
working on a mandatory ordinance and has begun working with its property owners 
to improve 11 hazardous buildings. The city already worked in conjunction with 
17 owners of buildings connected by the arcade, a stucco overhang that covered 
a downtown sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Ojai set up an assessment district there to finance $1.7 million in 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark has only seven buildings considered hazardous and Simi Valley only 
two. The cities of Thousand Oaks and Port Hueneme have none. 
</P>
<P>
All officials acknowledge that tough political and economic decisions lie ahead 
for the city councils that must make the policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no simple answer," Ventura's Millais said. "Our consultant put it to 
us this way: If the objective is to preserve downtown building stock and 
prevent loss of life and property in an earthquake, then we should do the 
upgrades. But if the objective is to keep the downtown economically viable, the 
solutions start becoming very complex."

CREDITORS AVENGE BAD LBOS WITH AGE-OLD CONCEPT; 
</P>
<P>
BUYOUTS: FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE SUITS ARGUE THAT THE DEALS HAVE LEFT SOME 
COMPANIES WITH TOO MUCH DEBT TO OPERATE AND BENEFIT BANKERS, LAWYERS AND 
ADVISERS AT CREDITORS' EXPENSE.

<TEXT>
<P>
By fall 1987, not even all the king's horses and all the king's men could have 
helped unpaid creditors put Wieboldt Stores back together again. The venerable 
Chicago retailer was more than bankrupt; its merchandise had been liquidated, 
and its dozen or so stores shuttered early that summer. 
</P>
<P>
So the creditors did the next best thing: They staked their claim to the 
shattered pieces by suing the financiers, executives and even public 
shareholders who had made possible or profited from the leveraged buyout of 
Wieboldt in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
And in so doing, the Wieboldt creditors pulled a string that many believe could 
unravel some of the business excesses of the 1980s -- an intricate weave of 
LBOs, greenmail, golden handshakes and junk bond financing -- and at the end, 
find and hold liable those responsible for the loss of jobs, profits and whole 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Wieboldt case was the first significant application of a simple, 
centuries-old legal concept called fraudulent conveyance to that most modern 
and sophisticated of financial transactions, the leveraged buyout of a publicly 
traded company. In an LBO, the buyers raise money to take over a company by 
mortgaging or selling its assets and using the proceeds to buy out the other 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, dozens of fraudulent conveyance suits have been filed or 
threatened in the wake of failed LBOs. Already they have proven to be powerful 
tools in creditors' hands. And, bankruptcy experts believe, as more companies 
face the bills on their buyout debt in an economic downturn, the stage is set 
for a staggering amount of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"This . . . is going to be the dominant issue in insolvency in the next five 
years as more and more of the LBOs hit the wall," said Dan S. Schechter, 
professor at Loyola Law School at Loyola-Marymount University in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, the fraudulent conveyance suits seek to undo heavily leveraged 
takeovers, arguing that companies such as Wieboldt didn't get a fair exchange 
when their assets were mortgaged and that the deals left them too crippled to 
continue to operate. Creditors are claiming that money owed them went instead 
to pay the people involved in the deals -- not just shareholders, but 
investment bankers, lawyers and other advisers. 
</P>
<P>
There are still many questions about how far a fraudulent conveyance suit can 
go in undoing an LBO or in roping back assets and money that have long since 
been distributed. Allan Dinkoff, a New York lawyer representing defendants in 
another LBO-related lawsuit, said: "Once an egg is scrambled, it's hard to 
unscramble it." 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission finds especially troublesome the 
prospect that years down the road, shareholders who had nothing to do with 
running the companies could be forced to return money they received in the 
deals. Successful suits, the SEC warned in arguments it filed last month in a 
case involving the 1984 sale of Kaiser Steel, could wreak havoc in the stock 
markets and cause investments to wither. 
</P>
<P>
The suits that have been pursued are still dragging through the courts, with no 
end in sight. With potentially thousands of defendants and hundreds of 
cross-claims for each case, "it will be a terrible mess," Schechter of Loyola 
said, "and no one is going to benefit except the lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than risk doubtful outcomes after lengthy and costly court battles, many 
players on both sides of the suit have chosen to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
In the Wieboldt case, claims against lenders who financed the deal have been 
settled, with the proceeds going to other creditors. Additional claims, 
including those against directors and inside shareholders -- company 
executives, for example -- are pending. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any clear path yet; everyone seems to be feeling their 
way," said Joel M. Wolosky, a New York lawyer who represents Wieboldt 
defendants. "Right now it's being used as a wedge in order to get settlements 
in the bankruptcy court." 
</P>
<P>
Even though these settlements often net only a fraction of the sums involved, 
there have been major victories for creditors -- especially unsecured creditors 
who traditionally stand near the end of the line in bankruptcy payouts. Some 
include: 
</P>
<P>
* Creditors of now-bankrupt Revco D.S., an Ohio-based drugstore chain that was 
taken private in a $1.25-billion buyout in 1986 and into bankruptcy court in 
1988, say their suit, which includes claims against 7,000 holders of junk bonds 
used to finance the buyout, helped prompt acceptance of their plan for the 
company's reorganization. Some creditors who would have been paid only 50 cents 
on the dollar under earlier proposals now expect close to 67 cents. 
</P>
<P>
* Bondholders first forced Resorts International into bankruptcy and then 
expedited the company's reorganization, saving time and costly fees, after a 
fraudulent conveyance suit was threatened. The reorganization set up a 
$5-million fund to pursue a fraudulent conveyance suit against Donald J. Trump, 
who made $150 million in the sale to Merv Griffin. Creditors may also ask the 
courts to force Trump to turn the Taj Mahal casino back over to Resorts. 
</P>
<P>
* Earlier this year, Texas Air Corp. agreed to pay $280 million to bankrupt 
Eastern Air Lines, which it took over in 1986. Eastern labor unions had filed 
suit, and the bankruptcy examiner found that Texas Air may have illegally 
transferred more than $400 million of Eastern's assets. 
</P>
<P>
* In a settlement that eventually led to Coleco's sale to Hasbro Inc., 
unsecured creditors who had been owed $420 million triumphed in a $71-million 
fraudulent conveyance claim against secured lenders who had helped finance 
Coleco's LBO. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, victims of failed LBOs are still waiting to realize benefits 
from their suits. This includes sufferers of asbestos-caused diseases who had 
thousands of claims against Jim Walter Co. and its Celotex subsidiary, a major 
producer of asbestos. The asbestos claimants sued in Texas after Jim Walter was 
taken over in an LBO led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., but they have 
made no progress since the company -- minus a newly spun-off Celotex -- was 
taken into bankruptcy in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Kaiser Steel Resources, the reorganized survivor of old Kaiser 
Steel, administrative costs and attorneys fees ate up most of the $27 million 
that Kaiser received in settlement of several claims relating to the steel 
company's sale. Former employees, who lost their promised lifetime medical 
benefits when Kaiser Steel declared bankruptcy in 1987, recently got a 
$3-million chunk of a settlement and are hoping future proceeds will help fund 
much reduced medical and pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers and bankruptcy negotiators have been closely watching the Kaiser 
fraudulent conveyance litigation, anticipating that upcoming decisions will 
influence the course of other such suits. 
</P>
<P>
Although many attorneys say settling such claims is in the best interest of the 
companies and creditors, they admit that they would like to see a few cases go 
through litigation. "Between the financiers, banks and bondholders, the selling 
and buying shareholders, who should bear the loss? These are important 
questions and they ought to be resolved," said Kenneth N. Klee, a noted Los 
Angeles bankruptcy lawyer involved in cases of Campeau Corp. and Resorts 
International. 
</P>
<P>
Before certain rulings were made in the Wieboldt case, much of the debate had 
concerned whether fraudulent conveyance statutes even applied to such modern 
transactions as takeovers and leveraged buyouts. The laws date back to 
Elizabethan England and were designed to cope with fairly simple situations. 
Suppose, for instance, that a financially strapped farmer on the verge of 
bankruptcy gave his possessions to friends or family members for little or no 
payment. With his assets parceled out, the farmer's bankruptcy would be all but 
assured. But his creditors -- butchers, bakers, landlords and the like -- would 
have no way of collecting from him. 
</P>
<P>
The Elizabethans declared that pre-bankruptcy deals in which assets changed 
hands without a fair-value exchange were "fraudulent conveyances." The butcher 
or baker who could prove that a fraudulent transfer of a debtor's assets had 
taken place could then, through the courts, force the family and friends to 
return the possessions, which then would be used to pay off the farmer's debts. 
</P>
<P>
In such cases, it was assumed that the farmer had intended to defraud his 
creditors. But as fraudulent conveyance statutes have been written in the 
United States, they have been expanded to cover such transfers regardless of 
intent. It is this "constructive" fraud -- where there may have been no intent 
to defraud -- that has been applied to many of the LBO cases. 
</P>
<P>
Wieboldt was the first significant constructive fraud case involving an LBO. 
Two important tests of whether the law could be applied to LBOs were met when 
the court found reason to support the creditors' claim that the company did not 
receive a fair-value exchange in the deal and that the complicated LBO 
financial transactions -- although seemingly separate -- were in fact all 
linked. 
</P>
<P>
According to attorney Wolosky, who represents two Wieboldt directors and an 
inside shareholder, if courts follow the reasoning of the Wieboldt case, 
fraudulent conveyance laws could be applied to "virtually every failed LBO." 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser Steel Resources is the fraudulent conveyance case now capturing the most 
attention. The reorganized company claimed that Kaiser was left insolvent by 
its sale in 1984 to a group led by Denver coal man Monty Rial and Tulsa 
businessman Joseph A. Frates. In 1985, Rial bought out Frates, who received 
additional payments and Kaiser property. 
</P>
<P>
While still under bankruptcy court protection, Kaiser began planning suits 
against officers and directors who approved the sale and firms that provided 
advice. Kaiser has already gained settlements with many defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser also sued Kaiser Steel's public shareholders -- those outside the 
company -- who accepted the buyout offer and the brokerages that handled their 
shares. The 10th Circuit Court in Denver has already upheld a lower court's 
dismissal of claims against the brokers, saying they were not parties to the 
transfer but merely conduits for the payments to shareholders. And the court is 
expected to dismiss claims against the public shareholders as well. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser's attorneys are already preparing a Supreme Court appeal. 
</P>
<P>
One of Kaiser's main contentions is that a failed LBO cheats a company's 
creditors because the shareholders got their money first, thwarting a 
well-established principle of corporate law. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Joseph L. Cosetti, chief bankruptcy judge in the Western District of 
Pennsylvania and president of the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges, 
said: "In priority, generally speaking, common shareholders are at the bottom. 
Secured creditors are first, then unsecured, then shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser President Daniel Larson said it is a question not so much whether there 
was intentional wrongdoing by the public shareholders but of who should be paid 
first. "It's always been the creditors," he said, "and if the shareholders get 
paid first, those are ill-gotten gains whether there was intent (to defraud) or 
not on the part of the shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constructive fraudulent conveyance: A transfer, or sale, can be ruled a 
constructive fraud if it is determined that the company resulting from the 
buyout received less than a "reasonably equivalent" value for the payments it 
made to shareholders and meets one of the following criteria: It became 
insolvent because of those payments, was too cash-poor to conduct its regular 
business or was taking on debts that it couldn't pay as they came due.

DOWNEY POLICE UNION CRITICAL OF CHIEF; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: POLL OF OFFICERS SHOWS MORALE PROBLEMS. THERE IS TALK OF A 
VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN D. CLAYTON MAYES' ADMINISTRATION. 
</P>

DOWNEY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These are exciting and trying times for rookie Police Chief D. Clayton Mayes. 
</P>
<P>
The chief is overseeing the largest police buildup in the history of Downey. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayes is also trying to put down a potential mutiny. A recent police union 
survey indicates officer morale has dropped in the year he has been in charge. 
And there has been talk of a vote of no confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Mayes shrugs off the criticism as that of a few disgruntled employees who are 
resisting his mission to enlarge and modernize the Police Department. There is 
little time for foot-dragging because crime is increasing in this city of 
91,000, Mayes said. 
</P>
<P>
Through last September, aggravated assaults in Downey were up nearly 30% over 
the same period last year, while car thefts increased 17.5%, according to 
police statistics. The city has also been the scene of some high-profile crimes 
of late, including a foiled robbery of a PACE store that left two officers 
wounded last October. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to provide the most professional and highest level of police service to 
the citizens of Downey," said Mayes, who had been a Los Angeles Police 
Department captain for 10 years when he was hired by the Downey City Council 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents describe Mayes as a dedicated disciplinarian who is giving more 
structure to the department. He is an energetic administrator who is known to 
work 12-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done very well, especially when you consider he's bringing in a new style 
of management," said longtime Councilman Robert G. Cormack. 
</P>
<P>
But detractors say Mayes is an arrogant administrator who is poisoning the 
department. He is the type of chief, for example, who is not shy about berating 
a captain in front of subordinates, according to responses in the union survey. 
Mayes has also drawn criticism for promoting the friends of a former councilman 
who voted to appoint him chief. 
</P>
<P>
"The man is a 24-hour politician," said Sgt. Mike Hadley, president of the 
Downey Police Officers Assn. "He comes across as being insincere." 
</P>
<P>
The chief has enjoyed some successes during his brief tenure. 
</P>
<P>
He has expanded the department's anti-gang unit from two to four field officers 
to keep Downey's relatively minor gang problem in check. He has overhauled the 
department's communications center at a cost of $360,000. He has tightened 
security and accountability in the department's evidence room, where 
confiscated drugs and other items are kept until trial. 
</P>
<P>
Mayes has reactivated a police officer "agent program," in which outstanding 
officers receive 5.5% bonus pay annually. And he issued an order last week 
enabling his officers to carry city-issued, 9-millimeter pistols. The pistols 
are favored by some policemen because the weapons hold about twice as many 
bullets as the automatics and revolvers that were standard in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
But he also has suffered highly visible setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Mayes has been reprimanded by City Manager Gerald M. Caton for using police 
officers and vans last summer to transport local high school students. The 
students were classmates of Mayes' son, Brian. 
</P>
<P>
Then last October, Caton and the City Council turned their backs on Mayes' 
proposal for a police helicopter. Just two weeks later, Caton came back with a 
$2.1-million proposal to add 27 officers to the city's 116-officer force. The 
City Council unanimously approved the buildup, and 27 officers are being 
recruited. 
</P>
<P>
Mayes ended up playing a supporting role in what was the council's most 
important law enforcement decision in years. 
</P>
<P>
The chief said he doesn't take offense at rejection of his helicopter proposal. 
And he says he always advocated hiring more officers as proposed by Caton. But 
Mayes said he wanted to employ a helicopter and then use remaining funds for 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the helicopter and additional officers," Mayes said. "I still believe 
in the helicopter." 
</P>
<P>
Dewey Clayton Mayes, 48, realized a dream when he was appointed police chief 
last December. He applied for the position in 1987 but was passed over for 
now-retired Police Chief Pete Stone, who had been with the Downey Police 
Department for 29 years before becoming chief. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayes family is well known in Downey, where they have lived for 20 years. 
Mayes, who holds a master's degree in public administration from Pepperdine 
University, was a member of the Board of Education of the Downey Unified School 
District for 13 years and has been active in other civic affairs. His wife, 
Carolyn, is a kindergarten teacher at a local school. They have two sons. 
</P>
<P>
The chief is an unimposing, talkative man who enjoys operating in his hometown. 
A local clothing store owner and his wife stopped by Mayes' table during a 
recent lunch at a local restaurant. It was the perfect opportunity for Mayes to 
offer one of his favorite compliments: "Is this your daughter?" he asked the 
store owner. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Mayes' community standing that made his appointment controversial 
from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Mayes is a friend of former Councilman Randall R. Barb, who was on the council 
and was one of chief's biggest boosters at the time of his appointment. Some 
critics said that friendship gave Mayes an unfair advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Others thought it was not a good idea for a local politician with political 
opponents to become police chief. Mayes was a school board member from 1974 
until 1987, when he lost a reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
Some Downey police officers had grumbled privately about Mayes' appointment 
from the start, but the honeymoon was definitely over last July. 
</P>
<P>
It was a Sunday morning, and a group of students from Downey High were about to 
set off for a leadership conference in Santa Barbara when a billing dispute 
arose with the limousine company they hired. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Mayes called his dad to work out a solution. Mayes placed two officers on 
overtime and had them drive the students in two police vans to the conference. 
Mayes said he loaned his son his personal car to avoid any appearance of a 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Caton later reprimanded Mayes for exposing the city to unnecessary liability 
and cost. The school district later reimbursed the Police Department $429 to 
cover the overtime pay for the two officers and gasoline costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I was extremely unhappy with that incident," Caton said in a recent interview. 
"We, in fact, helped out the school district when the school district should 
have helped themselves out." 
</P>
<P>
But Mayes said he saw it as a way to improve relations between the Police 
Department and the city's youth. He saw it as an extension of the Drug Abuse 
Resistance Education program, in which Downey officers lecture in local 
classrooms to prevent future drug use. As a former board member, Mayes said he 
feels committed to the district's goals. 
</P>
<P>
But would Mayes have provided the service if his son were not involved? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure," Mayes said. "The relationship between the Downey Police 
Department and the Downey school district is very unique. The school district 
is a very integral part of our operation." 
</P>
<P>
That incident and the changing conditions in the Police Department set the 
stage for the poll of the Downey Police Officers Assn. The decision to conduct 
the survey was made after a member brought up the possibility of a vote of no 
confidence against the chief at an association meeting, said Hadley, the police 
association president. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt a vote of no confidence was too severe at the time," Hadley said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four of the association's 103 members responded to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the officers rated department morale below average -- 2.7 on a scale 
of 10. Fifty-one respondents blamed the chief. Seven supported him, and some 
blamed the union for the morale problems. 
</P>
<P>
They rated management credibility below average -- 3.4 on a scale of 10. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of officers agreed to be interviewed about the school transportation 
incident and other matters on the condition that they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
They said patrol officers have been working too much overtime, and they 
resented the fact that the chief had kept two officers on duty for the 
school-related activity. 
</P>
<P>
They also said the new chief has created an atmosphere of distrust among the 
rank and file as he builds his administration. 
</P>
<P>
The officers faulted the chief for quickly promoting two friends of former 
Councilman Barb. William J. McCulloch had been a sergeant for less than two 
years when Mayes appointed him lieutenant last April. Charles S. Baptista had 
been a sergeant for a little more than two years when he made lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
Mayes said his appointments had nothing to do with Barb. He said McCulloch and 
Baptista were both rated "well qualified" in written and oral exams and 
deserved to hold the positions. 
</P>
<P>
The disgruntled officers also railed against what Mayes describes as his 
hands-on style. 
</P>
<P>
Mayes is the only Downey police chief to wear a uniform in recent years. He 
wears a beeper and listens to a police scanner. He often responds to the scene 
of a crime, even on weekends and sometimes with a council member or his wife or 
son along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
The officers said he interferes with their work, which could be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys in the department don't like to have a chief who's been sitting 
behind a desk backing them up on a pursuit," said one officer. 
</P>
<P>
But the chief, who became a policeman in 1964, bristles at the suggestion that 
he would get in the way. Mayes said he maintains his shooting and other police 
skills and could lend a helping hand in a bind. And he said he can manage the 
department better if he sees how his officers work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd put my field tactics up against any sergeant in this department," Mayes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayes said the officers are just griping because he is running a tighter 
operation than his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
Some officers resented the implication behind the chief's decision to spend 
about $6,000 to install an alarm system and take other measures to improve 
security of the department's evidence room. Mayes cut back the number of people 
with access to keys from 18 to four and performed an audit of the money, drugs, 
guns and other property stored there. Mayes said he is not one of the four. 
</P>
<P>
The review turned up some missing property: About two grams of cocaine, 
slightly over $100, a small amount of marijuana and one gun, Mayes said. 
</P>
<P>
The chief attributes the missing property to poor accounting. He said it is his 
job to tighten security in the shadow of recent skimming allegations that have 
rocked the Sheriff's Department and other police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody stole anything," Mayes said. "I think the integrity of 
this department is outstanding." A routine audit of the department's narcotics 
unit is under way. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to increasing security of the evidence room, sergeants are now 
required to wear gun belts in the station. Mayes said another change, while 
minor, also has rankled officers: his administrators are now enforcing a 
long-dormant rule that prohibited more than two officers at a doughnut shop at 
the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"Our resources are more stretched today than they were two years ago," Mayes 
said. "We need to be more mature. There's not as much available time." 
</P>
<P>
Mayes and Caton plan to meet with police association officials about the 
concerns identified in the survey. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayes appears to have the solid support of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Even Councilwoman Diane P. Boggs, the only council member to vote against 
Mayes' appointment, is standing behind the chief. "I don't see anything that 
can't be resolved," Boggs said. "I think there is evidence of some morale 
problems that need to be addressed. I expect they'll get with it and take care 
of it in-house."

BUILDING CODE COMPLAINTS GO UNCHECKED; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: LONG BEACH AUDIT BLAMES INEFFICIENCY AND POOR RECORDS-KEEPING IN 
THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT FOR BACKLOG.

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 23 inspectors in the Department of Planning and Building are so overwhelmed 
with complaints of code violations that they are unable to respond to many of 
them, according to a report issued by City Auditor Robert Fronke. 
</P>
<P>
The inspectors examine the city's aging stock of 70,000 residential units for 
building code violations ranging from holes in apartment walls to rats. The 
report did not audit the city Health Department, whose inspectors investigate 
health-related hazards in buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In his report, scheduled to be reviewed Tuesday by the City Council, Fronke 
found that the number of code enforcement cases in Long Beach increased 57% 
during the last fiscal year. During that period, the section recorded a total 
of 6,662 complaints, with 2,699 still pending. The audit blames the backlog on 
the need for increased efficiency and better record-keeping. "It's fairly clear 
that they don't keep up with the number of complaints," Fronke said. "We think 
part of the process ought to be to place some priorities and controls and 
allocate the manpower in the most effective way." 
</P>
<P>
The audit found that data was incomplete or missing from the office's 
computerized record-keeping system that stores information about violations. 
There are few records of the disposition of some of those complaints, according 
to the report. Sometimes citizens' complaints were not recorded completely, the 
report stated. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors would have more time in the field if clerical staff assumed some of 
their bookkeeping duties, the report suggested. It listed administrative 
problems such as the failure of employees to fill out overtime reports and a 
general lack of written policies and procedures for staff. 
</P>
<P>
Code Enforcement Operations Manager David Evans said the audit is fair. "We've 
taken steps to correct some of those inefficiencies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the office argue that the backlog is not caused by inefficiency, but 
by a lack of funding from the city. "We can't catch up," said Clark Searle, 
chief building inspector. Searle said that the number of complaints from city 
officials, tenants, and health and fire department officers is growing. 
Increasing numbers of people are moving into the city's old apartment houses, 
he said. "We've got a lot more people living in areas of the city that have 
been neglected for a long time," Searle said. 
</P>
<P>
Searle, who is retiring this month, said that in his 15 years with the office 
he has never seen the inspectors more swamped. "We're not getting our promised 
help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Searle said that two of the six inspectors charged with looking into 
substandard housing violations have left but that there is no money to replace 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does his office not get enough money, Searle said, but lately there 
has been a push by management to take his people and use them in other offices 
for work that generates money for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Recently three inspectors, charged with investigating property maintenance 
problems such as weeds, abandoned vehicles and run-down buildings were 
reassigned to jobs that are supposed to put money into the general fund, Searle 
said. For example, one inspector with the property maintenance unit was 
assigned to hand out tickets for parking violations. 
</P>
<P>
"If management thinks getting general revenues are more important than 
eliminating substandard and blighted buildings, that's their view," Searle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Paternoster, director of the Department of Planning and Building, said 
that funding for code enforcement is up to the City Council. "It's no secret 
that we have more complaints than we can inspect. The demand for code 
enforcement is greater than the resources we have," Paternoster said. 
</P>
<P>
Fronke argued that until the code enforcement section gets better organized, it 
is impossible to tell how much, if any, of the backlog is due to staffing and 
funding shortages. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're prepared to say that until we see what can be done with 
the current resources," Fronke said. "They need to have better controls and 
ways to measure their data and performance." 
</P>
<P>
But, inspectors ask, where will the money come from to make Fronke's 
recommended changes to the computer system? Evans said that the office has been 
unable to proceed with scheduled improvements to the system because of budget 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Housing activists have long complained that the city does not adequately 
enforce building code violations and that many apartment tenants live in filthy 
and unsafe conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"This city is in the Dark Ages when it comes to housing enforcement," said Kate 
McClatchy of the Long Beach Housing Action Assn. "The real issue here is that 
the city just doesn't make it a priority, because a lot of the people who live 
in the worst housing are poor, and they can't speak out."

ITS HUMOR PALES NEXT TO THE EXPENSE OF 'KEYS TO THE CITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a long-term resident of Long Beach, I used to tune in once in a while to 
Mayor (Ernie) Kell's program, "Keys to the City." It was good for a laugh. I am 
not laughing since the Los Angeles Times' Dec. 9 article on the Long Beach 
Telecommunications Department and its $1.1 million budget. 
</P>
<P>
Some unfunny aspects of "Keys to the City": 
</P>
<P>
* The show is an obvious political vehicle. Treatments are upbeat and general; 
controversy is avoided. If the program is to be "educational," not political, 
then citizens should hear the truth, not, in the mayor's words, "that the city 
is doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
* The budget is an insult to taxpayers who must continually cough up more sewer 
fees, boat slip fees, sweeper fines and even consider a proposition to tax 
themselves for additional police protection. 
</P>
<P>
* The city is not well-served by programming which glosses over real issues of 
crime, housing, gangs, etc. Kell says he avoids the "seedy" issues. If the 
mayor can publicly label AIDS a seedy issue, we are in big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
* As a cable subscriber it is doubly insulting. One hundred twenty-thousand 
Simmons cable subscribers at $23.82 a month equals $2,858,400. Five percent of 
this revenue amounts to $143,000 a month, or $1,715,000 a year -- what the city 
receives from Simmons Cable. Certainly this amount would provide a few more 
coveted Long Beach police officers, or at least one more to cover for Officer 
(Paul) Sanford while he is out doing "dramatizations" of drug busts. 
</P>
<P>
Any reading of our local newspaper's letters to the editor will tell you that 
our residents are fairly resigned to some buffoonery at City Hall. The article 
on the Kell show indicates that we have hit a new low. Perhaps a change of 
format is in order. We could let Rustin Greene, producer; (Susan) Weinstein, 
makeup artist, and some other of the show's well-paid staff participate in a 
panel discussion, explaining to a cross section of citizens how their efforts 
are more beneficial to Long Beach than, say, improved 911 response to better 
park maintenance. Now that would be political. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, we could ax the 5% from my monthly cable bill. That would be 
about enough to rent a Marx Brothers video.

Here is an opportunity to take a break from the crowded shopping malls and 
their parking lots to step back in time -- to a Christmas setting of 100 or 
more years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Los Cerritos Historic Site in Long Beach will hold its annual Christmas 
open house from 1 to 4 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
It can be an afternoon of wonderment for adults and old-fashioned fun for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can wander through the house whose every room is adorned with 
19th-Century furnishings and Christmas decorations. A costumed volunteer docent 
will be inside each room to tell portions of the rancho's history, from its 
humble beginnings as a Mexican cattle ranch to its development by 1880 into one 
of the largest sheep ranches in Southern California. Guests also will learn 
about the Bixby family, owners of the rancho, and how they and their ranch 
workers celebrated Christmas, according to Ellen Calomiris, historic sites 
officer for the city of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, visitors can stroll through the gardens, snacking on cookies and hot 
apple cider. The Silver Strings music group will entertain with songs of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
A pinata event for children is scheduled at 2:30 p.m. This old Mexican 
tradition was a favorite in California during the Christmas season in the 1800s 
-- and still is today. Santa Claus also will be there to distribute treats. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Los Cerritos Historic Site is at 4600 Virginia Road, on the grounds of 
the Virginia Country Club in the Bixby Knolls area of northwest Long Beach. 
Access is off San Antonio Drive. The Christmas open house is free to everyone, 
and no reservations are necessary. DON ERICKSON

THE LAST FIGHT OF FATHER OLIVARES; 
</P>
<P>
FOR YEARS HE CHALLENGED THE CATHOLIC HIERARCHY AND FOUGHT FOR IMMIGRANTS, FARM 
WORKERS AND THE POOR. NOW HIS OPPONENT IS AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, Marita Hernandez is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A FEEBLE, DISHEVELED OLD MAN shuffles into the study of the graceful, 
Spanish-style religious residence in Hancock Park. The elderly man, a retired 
priest who lives here, wears a watch cap and several day's stubble on his face. 
Clearly senile, he laughs uproariously as he recites, over and over, a 
nonsensical rhyme about Pancho Villa. 
</P>
<P>
Across the room, Father Luis Olivares watches silently, sitting crossed-legged 
at a large wooden table that dominates the study. "Si, como no," Olivares 
finally says, kindly humoring the old priest. "Yes, of course." 
</P>
<P>
But Olivares squirms in his chair. It is an unsettling moment for the 
controversial social crusader who suddenly -- since he was stricken with AIDS 
last summer -- finds himself idled, his world drastically shrunken, confined 
for the most part to this residential complex where he is convalescing. 
"Sometimes I say to myself, it would be better if I just went ahead and died," 
Olivares says. He is not afraid of death, he adds, but the thought of becoming 
dependent on others for his every need terrifies him as much as the stigma the 
disease carries. 
</P>
<P>
Daily, however, a steady stream of friends and admirers try to lessen his 
burden. Bishops and government leaders write or visit. Hollywood personalities 
drive up to the religious center in Jaguars and Mercedes-Benzes to take 
Olivares to lunch at the finest restaurants. Women of humble means from his old 
downtown church bring him home-cooked meals, and groups of his parishioners 
awaken him on occasion with morning serenades and cheers. And with loving 
silence they shelter their fallen leader from the rumors that now surround him. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares and his doctors believe that he, a diabetic, was infected through the 
use of improperly sterilized needles on one of his many trips to refugee camps 
in Central America. But inevitably, his vow of celibacy has come into question, 
and he anguishes over the possibility that innuendo will undermine his life's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares thought that he knew all about being poor and dejected. Hadn't he 
opened the doors of his historic downtown church, Our Lady Queen of Angels, to 
homeless immigrants and Central American refugees? Hadn't he championed the 
cause of farm workers and helped shape a poor and powerless East Los Angeles 
flock into an influential citizens lobby? Hadn't he clashed with the archbishop 
himself in pressing these causes? 
</P>
<P>
But suddenly, at 56, the priest who had become the voice of activism in the Los 
Angeles church finds his role reversed as he faces the cruel prospect of 
becoming one of the powerless outcasts he has long defended. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, now gaunt Olivares wanders the halls and gardens of the stately 
residence, sometimes in desperation, he says, "not knowing what to do with 
myself." A striking man, he remains elegant in fine tweed coats or guayaberas, 
but there is a vulnerable, almost brittle quality about him; his confident 
stride has become tentative, his balance and vision blurred by meningitis, a 
complication of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Yet if his spirits seem dampened, Olivares remains open to the world. He 
continues to grant interviews. "Everybody wants to know how a priest feels when 
he gets this," he says with good-natured sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
Before his diagnosis, Olivares occasionally appeared at AIDS fund-raisers. In 
recent months, however, he's put AIDS at the top of the list of causes to which 
he devotes his time; last month, he appeared as grand marshal at an AIDS 
benefit in East Los Angeles. And AIDS patients he has never met call for 
appointments, hoping for some special insight or wisdom. So far, he has been 
unable to provide it. "Most of the time, I don't know what to say. This is all 
new to me," he explains. "You try to live out your remaining time doing 
whatever good you can. That's what I'm looking for now." 
</P>
<P>
During interviews this fall, Olivares' strength ebbed and flowed as he battled 
the illness that sent him to the hospital for frequent blood transfusions. His 
speech was slow, and he found it difficult to remember dates and details of his 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Though he won't complain, Olivares repeats the words of others who bemoan the 
unfairness of his predicament. From the hundreds of letters he has received, 
Olivares quotes a New York Protestant minister he has never met who wrote that 
when he read that Olivares was ill, he literally screamed. "Why?" the minister 
demanded to know of God. "Why does He afflict people who are doing good?" 
</P>
<P>
As Olivares faces this, his toughest battle yet, he sees his many triumphs 
paling. "I've been trumpeting this identification with the people in my 
ministry. Yet, have I really been poor? Undocumented? Homeless?" he asks 
himself in one of his deepest moments of reflection. "Then the Lord sends this 
along and here I am." For the first time in his life, the veteran strategist 
for social change seems at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
A POOR MEXICAN KID from San Antonio, Luis Olivares rose quickly through the 
ranks of the church hierarchy to a life of material comfort, even luxury. Then, 
in the late 1970s, he traded position and rank to minister wholeheartedly to 
the poor. Though he has always hungered for acceptance, Olivares often has 
courted rejection, alienating some church and government officials by his 
strident stances in defense of his marginalized constituency. 
</P>
<P>
"Rejection is his cross," says Father Richard Estrada, a longtime friend. "He 
wants badly to be accepted by his (religious) peers. . . . But he won't back 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares is not easy to pigeonhole. He may be devoted to the poor, but he is 
also known for his expensive taste in clothing. After a week's hard work among 
the desperately poor, he heads to fancy shopping malls to browse amid the gaudy 
opulence. The contrast with his usually stark surroundings provides much needed 
"comic relief," he says. And yes, he confesses, there is a "very slight" thrill 
in seeing part of a world he gave up. 
</P>
<P>
At a benefit in his honor a few months ago, he was lauded by a glittering crowd 
of celebrities as well as government, labor and church leaders. In an 
arrangement symbolic of Olivares' principles, luminaries such as United Farm 
Workers union President Cesar Chavez, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, state 
senators and chancery officials sat next to immigrants and ordinary 
parishioners at tables elegantly set for the outdoor dinner at Olvera Street 
Plaza. From Our Lady Queen of Angels Church across the street came shouts of 
"Que viva el Padre Olivares! " Scores of homeless Central American refugees and 
illegal immigrants chanted enthusiastically as they stood in a sidewalk soup 
line outside the church where Olivares once ministered to them. It was this 
church that he opened to the homeless, allowing them to sleep in the pews 
despite protests from some parishioners and church officials. It was this 
church which, in 1985, he declared a sanctuary for Central American refugees -- 
the first in the Los Angeles archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced," Olivares told the dinner crowd, "that despite the futility 
that it might seem, our ministry was justified because it was a transparent 
sign of a better world. . . (an) exaggerated sign of God's presence in the 
midst of the poor." 
</P>
<P>
Many at the benefit praised Olivares as a modern-day prophet, a visionary hero, 
the conscience of the city. In less cordial settings, however, some of 
Olivares' detractors have labeled him a communist, citing his staunch 
opposition to U.S. policy in Central America. Others have called him a 
self-serving zealot who bought into his own press. 
</P>
<P>
"I always wondered when I'd see a picture of him and (former Nicaraguan 
President) Dan Ortega, what side of the issue of democracy he was really on," 
says Harold Ezell, former Western region commissioner of Immigration and 
Naturalization Services. "He was an embarrassment to the church leadership. 
You'd think he was the archdiocese spokesman, not the archbishop." 
</P>
<P>
Even some of Olivares' Claretian brethren, who saw his mid-career 
transformation from ostentatious church official to charismatic social 
crusader, have questioned his motives. 
</P>
<P>
"The order knows Louie as he was before," says Estrada. "They remember him with 
his big cars. Then they saw him going to El Salvador and being at the forefront 
of demonstrations, even getting arrested. And they feel he does it for ego. 
They don't trust him." 
</P>
<P>
The once scrawny barrio kid has found himself at the center of some of the 
region's most compelling and electric social causes -- often to his surprise. 
Olivares has celebrated union victories with farm workers and officiated at 
their funeral Masses. He was instrumental in founding the United Neighborhoods 
Organization of East Los Angeles, which has grown into the largest network of 
grass-roots organizations in the county. And in recent years, he has railed 
against U.S. funding of the right-wing government of El Salvador and led 
Southern California's immigrant- and refugee-rights movement, addressing 
thousands from the pulpit of Our Lady Queen of Angels Church -- the largest 
congregation in the sprawling Los Angeles archdiocese and long the focal point 
for Southern California's Latino Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares "fell deeply in love" with the farm workers, with his East Los Angeles 
parishioners and the poor who flocked to his church, says Father Rosendo 
Urrabazo, another longtime friend. "There is nothing he wouldn't do for them. . 
. . If Louie has made a mistake, it has been the mistake of all of those who 
fall in love -- his love blinded him to other realities." 
</P>
<P>
AS FAR BACK as Luis Olivares can remember, he thought he was special. In the 
large matriarchal family of Mexican immigrants, he was his grandmother's 
favorite. Olivares' brothers and sisters were charged with protecting and 
looking after him, the sickliest and most timid of seven children. Even when he 
got into mischief, the boy was easily forgiven. "Louie could do no wrong," his 
brother Henry and sister Rosario recall. 
</P>
<P>
He was only a toddler when his mother died. While his father worked to support 
the family, Olivares and his brothers and sisters were raised by an aunt and 
their grandmother, Inez, a Mexican immigrant widely respected in their San 
Antonio barrio as a spiritual adviser and folk healer. "Our grandmother gave us 
a good sense of self," Olivares says. "She didn't try to mold us. Rather than 
someone who protected us, she was an educator." 
</P>
<P>
In their hometown of Parras in the Mexican state of Coahuila, Inez and her 
family had been pillars of their church. When an anti-clerical fervor swept 
Mexico in the wake of the revolution of 1910, family members risked their lives 
to hide priests from government persecution. Then, fearing for their own 
safety, the family fled across the border to San Antonio, where they continued 
to shelter priests in exile. 
</P>
<P>
Priests from the local parish were always in and out of Louie's home; he 
considered them family. While other children played school or house, the 
Olivares youngsters often spent their days celebrating make-believe Mass. They 
used leftover pieces of unconsecrated Communion wafer bread and old prayer 
books. Louie, dressed in miniature vestments sewn by his grandmother, always 
officiated. Whenever they tired of the religious game and began making noise 
about playing something else, Louie would chastise them from his makeshift 
pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his grandmother's death when he was 13, Olivares entered a 
seminary in Compton, Calif.; his older brother Henry had entered the year 
before. The seminary was run by the Claretian Missionaries, the same order as 
their role models back home. This small order traces its roots to Spain and is 
best known for its ministry to Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
When Olivares joined, he had a vague idea of wanting to "do good." But it 
wasn't pure idealism that lured him to the seminary -- it offered one of the 
few tickets out of the barrio. "Given our economic condition, was it realistic 
to think I'd go to college or be able to pursue a career?" he says. It would be 
years before he would "look upon the priesthood as what it's supposed to be -- 
a means for changing the world, changing minds and hearts." 
</P>
<P>
Away from the cocoon of home and family, the youngster felt his first sting of 
racism -- white classmates made fun of his Spanish accent. His humble roots, 
his Mexican culture, even the Spanish language that he grew up with became 
distant memories as Olivares flourished in the Anglo-dominated seminary. "Louie 
was never satisfied with just doing what was expected," recalls Henry, who 
later left the priesthood to marry. "He was always involved in extracurricular 
activities, going on field trips, organizing picnics, in charge of committees." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares was singled out for special treatment by teachers who saw in the boy a 
strong sense of responsibility and leadership. He was entrusted with 
straightening out the prefect's office and polishing the sacred vessels used 
during Mass. In college at the Claretian seminary in Dominguez Hills, he led 
the school choir and managed to raise several hundred thousand dollars for the 
seminary by marketing greeting cards. 
</P>
<P>
In Olivares' high school yearbook, his classmates predicted that he would be a 
cardinal someday. The attention helped puff an already well-developed ego, but 
it also stirred resentment among peers. "There are a lot of strong egos in any 
religious community, and a lot of jealousy," Olivares says. "Being young and 
inexperienced, I didn't learn my lesson well. I tended to gloat. The notion is 
you're supposed to act very humble. . . . I thought that was false humility, 
and I never yielded to that." 
</P>
<P>
He earned a master's degree in business administration from Notre Dame 
University in 1964. Only three years later, at 33, he was appointed corporate 
treasurer of the Claretians' Western province, one of the highest church posts 
ever held by a Latino in the country. In Los Angeles, Olivares developed a 
taste for expensive silk suits, big black sedans and business lunches at the 
finest Beverly Hills restaurants. Shepherding the religious order's investments 
took him on regular trips to Europe for conferences at the Vatican, and to 
Chicago and New York, where he traveled by limousine and was wined and dined by 
bankers, stockbrokers and wealthy contributors. 
</P>
<P>
When a group of activist nuns lobbying for a "morally responsible" investment 
policy asked him to help cleanse church portfolios of company stocks tied to 
the Vietnam War, Olivares demurred. His only concern as trustee of Claretian 
money, he says, was to "maximize profits." 
</P>
<P>
During this time, he even turned down an invitation from a national group of 
priests called Padres to join their campaign to focus more attention on the 
concerns of Latinos in the church. Being linked to such a radical group, he 
reasoned, wouldn't do an up-and-comer much good. (He later regretted his 
decision and joined the group, eventually becoming its president.) 
</P>
<P>
As he rose through the ranks, Olivares returned to the seminary briefly -- this 
time as an administrator of the Claretian training center, then located on an 
old estate in Malibu Canyon. Some of the idealistic young men he supervised 
were scandalized by his well-heeled lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"We kidded him a lot about the new big, black LTD he got every year," says 
Urrabazo, one of the young seminarians who disdained Olivares' lifestyle. "He 
was a sobering statement to a lot of us that the world isn't the way we think 
it is." 
</P>
<P>
Even his family was a bit put off by bureaucrat Louie. Now and then he would 
breeze into San Antonio for a brief visit. But his brothers and sisters found 
it difficult to recognize the self-important priest with the designer clothes 
and businesslike manner. "It wasn't Louie," recalls Rosario Olivares, now 
Sister Victoria. "We weren't brought up that way." 
</P>
<P>
OLIVARES' RETURN to his cultural and spiritual roots began with one in a series 
of chance events that he came to call "opportunities for conversion." 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, a seminarian in East Los Angeles asked Olivares for permission to help 
the United Farm Workers organize their grape boycott. Seminary rules required 
such outside activity to be supervised by a senior priest. Without much 
thought, Olivares volunteered. Around the same time, Olivares was assigned to 
head his first parish, Our Lady of Solitude in East Los Angeles. He figured 
that experience at the large Latino parish, known as "La Soledad," would look 
good on his resume. 
</P>
<P>
What he hadn't counted on was the emotional wallop of working among his own 
"flesh and blood." For the first time since joining the priesthood, Olivares 
stepped out of the rarefied atmosphere enjoyed by the church elite and rubbed 
elbows with the Mexican community and the poor. "Then, (I came) into contact 
with the farm workers themselves and the spirit that moves them," Olivares 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
He was impressed by Cesar Chavez, the UFW leader, who had managed to unite 
Latinos in a national movement for the first time. Olivares walked the picket 
line with them, officiated at weddings and baptisms, and shared their sorrow at 
funerals when the union struggle sometimes turned violent and deadly. Olivares, 
who became the unofficial poet of the movement, inspired forces with eloquent 
homilies, "with words like wings," says union vice president Dolores Huerta. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares learned a lesson from the farm workers: You are converted by those you 
serve. "You may initially get involved in a cause for altruistic reasons, 
because you want to help those 'poor people,' " he says. "But pretty soon you 
are fighting with them and they are doing more to convert your way of thinking 
than what you are doing for them. After a while, the enthusiasm comes out of 
that rather than out of your own convictions." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, he responded with similar enthusiasm when Ernie Cortes, a fellow Texan 
and professional community organizer, enlisted Olivares' help in organizing a 
powerful and highly disciplined citizens lobby in East Los Angeles. Members of 
the Soledad parish still recall how Olivares encouraged them. He set up English 
classes and brought in professional organizers who taught parishioners how to 
speak in public and challenge officials to respond to their community needs. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time an advocacy group had drawn its strength and its 
structure from a parish organization. Among its victories, the United 
Neighborhoods Organization lists successful campaigns to reduce auto insurance 
rates, evaluate the performance of school principals and lobby for tough 
anti-crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
At UNO, Maria de la Luz Hernandez was one of Olivares' "creations," as she puts 
it. The mother of nine children, Hernandez was once so timid she never ventured 
from home without her husband's permission. But with Olivares' encouragement, 
she learned to address large crowds at UNO conventions and lobby city officials 
for neighborhood improvements. "For 24 years I lived in silence," she once 
said. "But Father Olivares dared to come to our home. My husband had too much 
regard for him to say no." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares came to believe in including lay and religious church members, without 
regard to rank, in the building of a community -- an uncommon, if not 
revolutionary, notion in the church's highly hierarchical structure. His 
willingness to involve parishioners in church decisions and his team-approach 
to ministry became his trademarks. "I recognize that those instances in which 
something significant has happened, it has been because of somebody by my side, 
rather than out of my own initiative," he says. "If you trust a person, a lot 
can happen." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Olivares was assigned to Our Lady Queen of Angels, the 200-year-old 
church in the heart of Los Angeles' Mexican birthplace that draws 10,000 
worshipers -- mostly Latinos -- to Sunday Masses. Under Olivares, the church 
that Latinos affectionately call La Placita, "Little Plaza," became a haven for 
refugees and illegal immigrants -- a place not only to bed down and get a 
square meal, but also to find encouragement and someone willing to speak out on 
their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
For Olivares, the presence of so many desperate people at his church door was 
clear testimony of the failure of immigration laws as well as U.S. policy in 
Central America. He felt compelled to see for himself the source of so much 
misery. That quest took him to Salvadoran refugee camps in Honduras and later 
to El Salvador. At the camps, he found refugees living in squalid conditions as 
virtual prisoners. "You cannot be witness to human suffering and not be 
convinced of the existence of social sin," he said at the time. "We are all 
responsible unless we take a stand and speak against it." 
</P>
<P>
OLIVARES HAD infuriated immigration authorities by declaring his church a 
sanctuary in 1985. Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony sidestepped the issue, 
declining to publicly condemn or condone the action. Then, in 1986, Congress 
passed sweeping changes in immigration laws, including a provision that 
outlawed the hiring of undocumented workers. And when Olivares announced that 
he planned to urge employers to continue hiring illegal immigrants, federal 
officials complained to Mahony and launched an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Olivares, his associate pastor, Father Michael Kennedy, and Father Gregory 
Boyle, pastor of nearby Dolores Mission, were summoned to Mahony's office. The 
archbishop asked them to sign pledges to respect the hiring ban. They refused, 
saying they couldn't comply with a law that they believed was immoral. "What 
right do you have to set policy for this archdiocese?" one of Mahony's aides 
angrily shot back, Olivares says. 
</P>
<P>
By resisting Mahony, Olivares knew he was jeopardizing his future at La 
Placita. But he calculated that the archbishop would prefer to avoid the public 
relations stink that would surely ensue from sacking three controversial 
priests. The gamble paid off. Within days, Mahony retracted his request for 
their signatures and asked only that the three exercise more discretion in 
their pronouncements. As a compromise, the priests agreed to tip off Mahony 
before going public with controversial stances. Since then, Olivares has 
frequently found himself on the wrong side of the law. Last year, he was 
arrested several times for blocking the entrance to the Federal Building in 
downtown Los Angeles during mass protests against U.S. policy in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony has been "very effective in providing a sense of vision," particularly 
on issues of social justice, Olivares says. "But his methodology for getting 
things done takes a lot of time. Meanwhile, those of us on the front lines have 
to deal with the problems at our church door." 
</P>
<P>
On the immigration issue, for instance, Mahony's approach has been to lobby for 
changes in the law. Olivares, however, argues that there are times when 
"unjust" laws must be broken. Olivares doesn't expect someone in Mahony's 
position to espouse breaking the law. Still, he adds, "I'd prefer he were 
publicly more supportive of those of us on the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, the real radical changes in the church have never come out of 
the institution," Olivares explains. "They always come out of the periphery." 
</P>
<P>
That reasoning as well as his insistence that ministering to the poor holds a 
higher priority than running a smooth parish operation was rejected by some of 
Olivares' Claretian brethren. In their eyes, Olivares allowed La Placita to 
devolve into a disorderly, even dangerous place overrun not just by homeless 
men but also petty criminals. An elderly priest had been mugged in the open 
courtyard, and merchants in the Olvera Street tourist complex had begun 
complaining that they were losing business. Several of Olivares' fellow 
Claretians at La Placita abandoned ship; no volunteers took their places. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is: 'What is the priority?' " Olivares argues. "Do you limit the 
number of people you are going to serve for the sake of efficiency? Are you 
going to exclude some people from church services because they look sloppy and 
the church looks messy with all these homeless people floating around?" 
</P>
<P>
One of the priests who left La Placita, Olivares recalls, accused him of 
allowing "the myth of Luis Olivares" to go to his head. At a general assembly 
of the order last spring, which surprised some by its emotional and bitter 
tone, some members questioned Olivares' motives and accused him of being "out 
for his own glory." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Olivares narrowly lost an election among Claretians to become head 
Provincial for the order's Western province. A few years earlier, his brethren 
had refused to reelect him to a third term as their treasurer. Such rejections 
weighed heavily on Olivares, who found himself outside the circle of power. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say it hurts, but it does make you angry," he says. Although 
he recognizes that the strong reaction he elicits is a sign that he is "making 
a difference," it is an uncomfortable position for a man who thrives on 
acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last summer, after serving nine years as pastor at La Placita, Olivares 
was removed from his post by his superior in the order. Technically, Olivares 
had been allowed to serve well past the usual three-year term for a pastor. So 
he did not object when he was told that, at the end of his third term, he would 
be reassigned to a parish in Texas. What he did object to, and strenuously, was 
the method of selecting his successor. 
</P>
<P>
He pleaded with superiors to choose someone willing to continue his work. But 
when that failed, Olivares planned to take his objections all the way to Rome. 
"I just could not see how my (regional) superiors could make changes at Plaza 
without knowing what the needs there are," he says. "They never came and asked 
questions of the pastoral team or of the employees or of the parishioners." 
</P>
<P>
But Olivares fell ill before he could follow through on the appeal. In early 
June, after several days in bed with what he thought was the flu, he was taken 
to the hospital where doctors began tests that would diagnose his illness. From 
his hospital bed, Olivares received disquieting reports: An interim pastor 
began scaling back services to the homeless, and the church courtyard was made 
off limits to them during the day. Meanwhile, police, whom Olivares had barred 
from church premises, began chasing homeless men away from the street and 
sidewalks. The new permanent pastor, Albert Vazquez, former vice president of 
the Mexican American Cultural Center in Los Angeles, has vowed not to throw the 
men out, but he is trying to assuage authorities, parishioners and nearby 
merchants. 
</P>
<P>
During Olivares' tenure, there was no mistaking his priorities. If anyone 
complained about his favoritism for immigrants and the homeless, he simply 
asked: "What if that person is Jesus and I turn him away? How can I do that?" 
</P>
<P>
ON A CRISP fall afternoon, Olivares receives a hero's welcome at an open house 
at Casa Rutilio Grande, the refugee shelter he helped establish five years ago 
at a former Hollywood convent. He now works here a few hours almost every day. 
A handful of young men who run the facility -- refugees and immigrants 
themselves -- speak glowingly of the difference that Olivares has made in their 
lives and in the lives of hundreds of others who have passed through the 
shelter's doors. 
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged Salvadoran woman with waist-long black hair runs and buries her 
face and her tears in Olivares' chest and won't let go. The fact that he does 
not know her does not seem to matter. "I love him like a father," she says, 
explaining later that she had not seen him since he had fallen ill. "There'll 
never be another to speak for us like he did." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares' illness has silenced most of his critics. Ernest Gustafson, a former 
Los Angeles director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, stopped by 
to visit, as has Archbishop Mahony. In a public statement released after his 
first visit, Mahony called Olivares a man of commitment and courage who 
"aroused the conscience of us all as we try to understand our responsibilities 
toward newly arrived peoples and those whose lives are not sheltered by laws 
and protections." 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson, however, couldn't resist getting in a jab. When Olivares 
complimented him for "helping people" in his new role as unpaid adviser to 
Latino immigrants, Gustafson responded: "But I do it within the law." 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant advocates say Olivares' unexpected departure has left a terrible 
vacuum in the movement's leadership. "Father Olivares helped shape public 
attitudes and created a critical mass that finally broke through the 
indifference of city officials," says Linda Wong, a leading immigrant-rights 
activist and director of the California Tomorrow Foundation, a nonprofit 
research group. "I can't think of anyone else in Southern California with the 
kind of stature and moral authority he has. And I haven't seen many people so 
willing to commit beliefs to action." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters among his fellow Claretians have taken to calling him "a living 
hero." "He has taught us a concern for the poor, a willingness to take risks, 
the courage to say what needs to be said, and his concept of being a public 
presence in the fight for social justice," Urrabazo says. 
</P>
<P>
Now his battle is with a more personal foe. Doctors at Cedars Sinai Medical 
Center summoned Olivares' family and closest friends to his bedside in late 
June when it looked as if he might not survive. At times, the frail and 
emaciated Olivares, lying in a fetal position, failed to recognize them. The 
life-and-death battle continued for weeks, as doctors struggled to control the 
meningitis so they could begin administering AZT, the AIDS drug. 
</P>
<P>
When doctors told Olivares he had AIDS, he cried. He delayed telling even his 
family the truth, but doctors convinced him that the best way to head off 
criticism was to break the news himself. 
</P>
<P>
As in previous battles, the most troubling aspect is the potential personal 
rejection. "It's hard for me to say (even to hospital nurses) that I am 
HIV-positive. People jump to conclusions, judgments. The stigma of AIDS, I 
believe, is part of the rejection and abandonment Our Lord (went through) when 
he was put on the cross. That's very real to me now." Though he flatly denies 
having engaged in any sexual activity, Olivares has resigned himself to the 
fact that "people will continue to speculate, no matter what I say." 
</P>
<P>
There are small consolations. He still takes refuge in the Arvizu family, 
former parishioners he has known for years. On his weekly visits to their West 
Covina tract house, he is so at home that he scavenges the refrigerator for 
snacks and naps while watching television in the family den. It's a large, 
fun-loving family with three children and eight grandchildren. They are among 
the few allowed to glimpse the guileless, playful and easily hurt man who hides 
behind the imposing public persona. With them, he shares his childlike 
enjoyment of Christmas preparations and the good-natured teasing of family 
members. He likes nothing better, they say, than a raucous family party, where 
after a few drinks, he can belt out his favorite Mexican country ballads. 
</P>
<P>
What has him stymied is the uncertainty and unpredictability of his illness, 
and the conflict between his desire to work and the doctor's vague admonition 
"not to overdo it." He hears accounts from other AIDS patients who have 
returned to normal lives only to be struck down again. He has yet to decide 
exactly how to live out the time left to him. 
</P>
<P>
He has lost interest in many things he used to care about -- especially 
discussions about the future. Recently, at a meeting to discuss the financial 
future of the order, Olivares found his only concern was how the changes might 
affect his medical care. 
</P>
<P>
The uncontrollable self-preoccupation is terrible, he says. But it has led him 
to put his house in order. He gave most of his clothes and books away as well 
as dozens of religious statues and medals. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he has undertaken a spiritual housecleaning of sorts. "The Lord has 
given me notice so I have enough time to re-establish my priorities as a 
religious person." But he admits that serious reflection is difficult for a man 
who has lived by the axiom that work is his prayer. The impulse to be involved 
remains strong; slowly he has resumed making public appearances. And he has 
begun exploring the possibility of returning to work at a parish. "I would like 
to be available to people," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He is not afraid of death, he says again: "Life is worth living. And so, you 
just hope that you will be able to deal with what comes."

THE HONOR SYSTEM WORKS ALL NIGHT LONG AT BART'S BOOKS; 
</P>
<P>
OJAI: REAL ESTATE AGENTS CITE THE STORE AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE CITY'S SMALL-TOWN 
STYLE. THEY SAY IT HELPS SELL HOUSES. 
</P>

<P>
Bart's Books in Ojai is a bookstore that believes in doing business on the 
honor system. 
</P>
<P>
When the store is closed, customers may still buy books from a dozen four-shelf 
bookcases mounted on outside walls. 
</P>
<P>
The honor system is in effect all day on Mondays and every night of the week 
from the time the store closes at 5:30 p.m. until it reopens the next day at 10 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
And very few of the bookstore's customers ever abuse their privileges. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel good about it," said Gary Schlichter, 56, owner of the bookstore at 
302 W. Matilija St. "It's a tradition going on since the store opened 26 years 
ago. Very seldom does someone take a book without paying. 
</P>
<P>
"It restores your faith in humanity," Schlichter added. "I'd say at least 95% 
of the time people drop their money into the box." 
</P>
<P>
The outside shelves are always stacked with about 1,000 used books -- 
paperbacks, hardbacks, a mix of fiction and nonfiction -- all selling from 15 
to 50. Prices are marked on each book. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a person lacks the correct change or leaves an IOU. They'll come in 
when the store is open and say: 'Here's the money I owe you,' " Schlichter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
People on foot, bicycle, horseback, in cars and trucks patronize the store 
after hours. 
</P>
<P>
"If the overhead lights aren't strong enough for them, they will often use 
vehicle headlights or flashlights to help read the titles or browse," 
Schlichter said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart's Books is a bookstore that makes everybody feel good and proud of their 
hometown. It speaks very well for Ojai and the basic honesty of people who live 
here," Mayor Nina Shelley said. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai, population 7,000, is home to many writers and artists. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors say they point out the bookstore to potential home buyers, citing it 
as an example of Ojai's small-town style. They say the image helps sell houses. 
</P>
<P>
"I drive my clients by Bart's and describe the honor system in buying books 
when the store is closed. They are in awe," realtor Goldena Stallings said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Randolph, 53, the store's assistant manager, said out-of-towners 
constantly tell him that the system would never work where they live, that the 
books would be cleaned out overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all curious about what happens when it rains. The shelves have a large 
overhang and the books are fairly well protected. We may lose a few in a 
driving rain storm, but it doesn't happen very often," Randolph said. 
</P>
<P>
The bookstore is in a 55-year-old house, two garages and a large patio jammed 
with bookshelves containing more than 100,000 used books. 
</P>
<P>
Books are arranged on shelves according to categories, from travel to the 
occult. The kitchen is full of cookbooks. Hallways have travel books. History 
is in a garage. In the patio, the books are on shelves sheltered by the 
branches of a 300-year-old live oak tree. 
</P>
<P>
The books come from estate and library sales as well as from individuals who 
bring boxes and shopping bags full of books every day to sell or trade. Many of 
the contributions come from people who are moving or cleaning out the house. 
</P>
<P>
People from all over Southern California find their way to Bart's. 
</P>
<P>
Lilibeth Bishop, 31, of Malibu, a writer for Women's Journal, a popular 
Philippines weekly, told how she looked all over the Los Angeles area for 
"Elmer Gantry" and "It Can't Happen Here," two Sinclair Lewis books long out of 
print. 
</P>
<P>
She found them at Bart's. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't find a book anywhere else, chances are you will find it here," 
she said.

after-hours pay for them. The shelves are stacked with about 1,000 used books.

COLLEGE DRAMA CLASSES HELP STUDENTS BECOME A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW; 
</P>
<P>
THESPIANS: LAWYERS USE THEATRICAL TRAINING TO IMPROVE THEIR CHANCES OF SUCCESS 
IN JURY TRIALS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS TO INTERACT BETTER WITH CLIENTS.

<P>
Jennifer Kirk of Thousand Oaks is studying acting at Moorpark College because 
she wants to be effective in her efforts to educate the public on Tourette's 
Syndrome and obsessive-compulsive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Braden McKinley, the Ventura County district attorney's top investigator, first 
studied drama because his 15-year-old daughter needed transportation to a night 
acting class. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Guastella of Simi Valley, a business major, is learning the fundamentals 
of the theater because he believes that in the corporate world, appearances are 
as important as financial acumen. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk, McKinley and Guastella are among a large group of people who shatter the 
myth that any Southern Californian taking an acting class harbors dreams of 
being the next Kevin Costner or Julia Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
People take acting classes for many reasons, said Katherine Lewis, who teaches 
drama at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
Some -- such as Guastella -- have clearly defined professional goals: Lawyers 
use theatrical training to improve their chances of success in jury trials and 
psychologists to interact better with clients. 
</P>
<P>
"Others might be there for therapy -- maybe in high school they weren't liked 
or they're shy," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Varela, a drama instructor at Ventura College, said personal development is 
probably one of the most common motivations for taking his class, particularly 
at the beginning level. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people take the class because they feel it will help them with their 
sense of self-confidence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Perez, a 24-year-old medical assistant who's attending Moorpark College 
part time, said she is taking beginning acting because she believes that it 
will help her interact more effectively with patients and others. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would help me be open, because I wouldn't be afraid of what 
people think of me," Perez, of Simi Valley, said. 
</P>
<P>
Guastella, also at Moorpark College, sees his beginning acting class as a 
steppingstone to success as he pursues a career as a financial analyst and 
corporate takeover artist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's helpful in dealing with people," he said. "In business, a lot depends on 
appearances -- how you look and act. Donald Trump has created a character of 
himself that is bigger than life." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most unusual reason for taking an acting class is offered by Kirk, 
who said she has both Tourette's Syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
</P>
<P>
The syndrome is a rare neurological disease with a variety of symptoms, 
including involuntary purposeless movements, swearing, tics and incoherent 
grunts and barks. Kirk said her case is mild, with physical tics and a tendency 
to clear her throat. And she said she is obsessive or compulsive about touching 
things or people. 
</P>
<P>
A liberal arts major at Moorpark, Kirk, 27, wants to make a career on the 
professional lecture circuit and on television talking about the two disorders. 
In fact, she has already been on "The Today Show" and said she is very 
comfortable in front of audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get up on stage I'm fine because I'm concentrating on something I 
enjoy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Varela believes drama classes can be particularly helpful for people with 
disabilities, and their participation in the course is of value to the other 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got disabled people, deaf people, a student with a spinal injury who has 
taught us a lot about how to focus because it's so difficult for him to move," 
Varela said. 
</P>
<P>
The student with the spinal injury recently did a scene in which he played a 
farmer being pressured by a salesman to sell his land. The scene required him 
to take oranges out of a box. 
</P>
<P>
"The way he was doing it was so compelling," Varela said. "He did it much more 
slowly and with tremendous commitment to each gesture." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the class is helping the student in his determined fight to 
gain independence, Varela said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis believes that theatrical training is valuable no matter what field a 
student is pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are many professional areas that require people to be persuasive 
speakers," she said. "I feel that acting should be a requirement like speech 
is. 
</P>
<P>
"There's getting up in front of people with their cards and boring people, or 
getting up before people and appealing to them emotionally," she added. "People 
are not just moved by reason. They're moved by emotion." 
</P>
<P>
McKinley has found that to be true in his job as chief investigator with the 
Ventura County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"Acting can really help an executive who gives presentations or conducts 
meetings," the 48-year-old Ventura resident said. "The fundamentals of acting 
are just like the fundamentals of life." 
</P>
<P>
But unlike students who have taken drama classes for reasons other than a 
career in film or on stage, McKinley harbors Hollywood ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
A career law enforcement officer who had dabbled a little in high school and 
church theatrical productions, McKinley fell into taking drama last spring when 
his teen-age daughter Julie signed up for a night class at Ventura College. 
Since he had to drive her to campus, he decided to take the class with her. 
</P>
<P>
He loved his class, got a part in the college's summer production of "The 
Fantasticks" and was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has performed in the Plaza Players' production of "Bent" in 
Ventura and will play the lead role in the "Romantic Comedy," which opens New 
Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
He is considering trying out for commercials or television. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not foolish enough to think I could support myself or put my kids through 
college on my acting ability alone," he said. "But it's a great diversion from 
a very stressful job I have now."

PARKS GROUP SEEKING NEW FUND SOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Staggered by voter rejection of a massive bond issue that would have given it 
$76 million in yearned-for revenues, a state agency that buys parkland in the 
Santa Monica Mountains is studying new ways of raising money for itself, 
including a scaled-down bond initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy decided earlier this week to spend 
$88,000 to pay three staff researchers for six months of exploring alternative 
ways of raising more cash. 
</P>
<P>
The action followed the defeat last month of Proposition B, the biggest bond 
measure in county history. The $816-million initiative was designed to finance 
improvements to parks, beaches, museums and other public facilities throughout 
Los Angeles County. The bonds, which required two-thirds approval for passage, 
received only 57%. 
</P>
<P>
About $76 million of the proceeds were earmarked for parkland acquisition by 
the conservancy. The agency, which played a major role in drafting and 
promoting the bond act, also would have been eligible for an additional $30 
million designated for trail planning and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Our great hope was Proposition B, which would have carried us on and done 
incredible things," conservancy Chairwoman Carole B. Stevens said. "It came so 
close to winning and it was heartbreaking to lose." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the conservancy will not get $10 million set aside for it in a 
statewide bond issue, Proposition 149, which also went down to defeat in the 
Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston said the agency's budget "is 
extremely tight" as a result of the two failed bond measures. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy's biggest source of income next year, $10 million from a 
statewide bond issue that passed last June, is already reserved for buying land 
in Fryman Canyon in Studio City, Malibu's Corral Canyon and Sage Ranch south of 
Simi Valley, Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
"We basically have cleared out the cupboard and emptied the cookie jar and then 
. . . licked all the crumbs from the jar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy officials had been counting on Proposition B to finance the 
purchase of a number of parcels that may now be snapped up for development, 
Edmiston said. Esther Feldman, a conservancy official who managed the campaign 
for Proposition B, said the conservancy is looking into the possibility of 
another bond issue -- aimed only at Los Angeles city voters -- to generate new 
funds. The measure would raise more than $200 million.

YANAI WINS 200TH AS TOROS PLOD PAST N. COLORADO, 49-46; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: IT WASN'T PRETTY. ONLY 77 PEOPLE WATCHED. BUT THE CAL STATE 
DOMINGUEZ HILLS BASKETBALL COACH REACHED A CAREER MILESTONE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball Coach Dave Yanai finally won his 200th 
collegiate game Saturday night, but it wasn't pretty. 
</P>
<P>
In a game that featured 36 turnovers, horrible field-goal shooting and the 
inability of either team to sustain momentum, host Dominguez Hills managed to 
outlast pesky Northern Colorado, 49-46, and hand the man Indiana Coach Bobby 
Knight calls "one of the best coaches in the nation," a mark that has been on 
hold for some time. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, only 77 people were in the Toro gym for the tip-off, but that is no 
surprise to Yanai. He has toiled in anonymity here for 14 seasons, with one of 
the smallest budgets of any Division II coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't think about the 200-win thing unless someone reminded me of 
it" Yanai said. "At this time, the faces of the players of the past come to 
mind. We have had a great deal of effort and commitment to this program." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai's wife, Sae, who witnessed Saturday night's contest, said her husband 
never considered the impact of his 200th victory. 
</P>
<P>
"With what he has had to put up with, I'm surprised he got this far," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Robert Barksdale, who scored 10 points Saturday night, has been 
involved of 50 of those victories. He said Yanai is more interested in his 
players than he in the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
"He cares about us as individuals, not just as players. He wants us to be 
better people." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills has won only 18 of its last 45 games, and the 200-win watch has 
been in effect ever since March, 1989, when Yanai guided the Toros into the 
Western Regionals with a 20-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
But last season, with only one starter returning, the Toros fell to 10-17. This 
year the team is 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai calls this club the "most talented I have had." Unfortunately, it has yet 
to prove it. Dominguez Hills made just 16 of 62 field goal attempts (25.8%) 
Saturday night, and 21 of 49 (43%) last Thursday when it edged Point Loma, 
55-54. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills jumped out to a 10-0 lead as Northern Colorado (1-5), committed 
seven of its game-high 23 turnovers in the first five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bears, who had a front line averaging 6-foot-7 1/2, rallied and trailed 
only 25-24 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros took a 33-26 lead three minutes into the final period, but Northern 
Colorado went on a 10-2 spurt and took its first lead, 36-35, with 11:20 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears led by as many as three points, but Dominguez Hills tied it at 43 
with 5:29 to go on two free throws by guard Sal Serrano. 
</P>
<P>
That put the game into the hands of senior Division I transfer Keith 
Billingslea, who became eligible to play Friday after sitting out a year. 
</P>
<P>
Billingslea, a transfer from Northern Arizona, made a key steal and lay-in with 
4:45 to go, hit a three-point field goal 2 1/2 minutes later, then sank one of 
two free throws with 34 seconds left.

Most kids would say their moms are wonderful, but how many can say, "My mom is 
a living doll" without stretching the truth a little? 
</P>
<P>
Jessica Slocum can. She's the heroine of the modern-day fairy-tale A Mom For 
Christmas, an NBC movie about a motherless little girl with a heartfelt 
wish-she wants a mother of her own for Christmas. The magic starts when a 
department store mannequin comes to life, thus granting Jessica and her 
workaholic dad that special someone in their lives. But the two soon realize 
that they'll have to do some very quick thinking to keep their new "mom" with 
them once the holidays are over. Olivia Newton-John stars as mom/mannequin Amy, 
Doug Sheehan plays Jessica's dad, and Juliet Sorcey plays Jessica. 
</P>
<P>
"A Mom For Christmas," Monday at 9 p.m. NBC. For families.

IS TWO TOO MUCH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE

<TEXT>
<P>
Is there room for two networks that specialize in business and financial news? 
"Let's put it this way," New York financial analyst Mark Riely said, "I don't 
think cable operators feel that in the midst of channel scarcity it's the most 
productive thing to have two duplicate services." 
</P>
<P>
Ratings from the A.C. Nielsen Co. show that FNN has the edge over CNBC during 
the business day, but CNBC pulls in slightly more viewers at night. FNN's 
afternoon rating is .3, meaning that with 35.4 million subscribers an estimated 
106,200 of them flip to the station at some point in the day. During roughly 
the same time, CNBC draws 33,400 viewers nationally based on a .2 rating in 
16.7 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
Some cable operators offer both networks. West Valley Cablevision in Chatsworth 
carries CNBC full-time, but FNN only during the day, switching to Prime Ticket 
at night. "The two are competitors in a sense," general manager Tom Belcher 
said. "But FNN is still more for the hard financial person. CNBC is more 
attuned to the everyday consumer, who may or may not be involved with the stock 
market." 
</P>
<P>
But, Joyce Newman, a television producer for the nonprofit Consumer's Union, 
suggests that a consumer-oriented cable network has its limitations. "We take 
an approach on product stories," she said. "CNBC is not going to do that sort 
of consumer story. It's not in their best interest because they need 
advertisers." 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, Riely said, CNBC's real threat may not be FNN at all. "There 
are some in the industry, including Ted Turner, who believe that CNBC will 
never find a way to be profitable in the financial news service, not with FNN 
as a competitor," he said. "CNBC will have to turn to broader news, and that 
makes CNN its major competitor." DANIEL CERONE

A CATALOGUE OF FILM CLASSICS FROM CHRISTMASES PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For many of us, some of the happiest Christmas memories happened at the movies. 
Video makes it possible to relive those golden moments: Bing Crosby singing 
"White Christmas," Edmund Gwenn showing us there really is a Santa Claus, Jimmy 
Stewart standing by a tree discovering the gift of life, Jean Shepherd 
reminding us what it was like to be young the night before Christmas, Dickens' 
Scrooge come to life. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby introduced "White Christmas" in one of the best holiday musicals ever 
created on film: Holiday Inn (MCA tape and laser Encore Edition video disc). 
Irving Berlin crowded the 1942 black-and-white film with one song after 
another, each memorializing a holiday. Crosby and Fred Astaire (or both) sing 
(or dance to) them and it's a sure-fire way to start the holidays right. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby sang the Yuletide classic again in White Christmas, a 1954 Berlin 
songfest with Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen (Paramount tape and 
disc). A tiresome plot almost swamps the typically merry Berlin score-the 
patter-song "Sisters," still another version of "Blue Skies" and the 
indestructible title song. 
</P>
<P>
Miracle on 34th Street (Playhouse Home Video tape and disc) is the 1947 classic 
featuring Gwenn as Kris Kringle, a department store Santa who just may be the 
real thing. The way he goes about convincing everyone (especially the little 
girl who steals the film, Natalie Wood) that he's the great Mr. Claus is great 
fun. Skip the colorized version; everyone looks anemic, like early Polaroid 
snapshots left out in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
For most of us, even a colorized Gwenn is Santa, not the imposter in Santa 
Claus: The Movie (Media Entertainment tape; Image Entertainment laser video 
disc). Not that David Huddleston doesn't look the part (his first sleigh ride 
at the beginning is impressive). But even Dudley Moore as a fallen elf and John 
Lithgow, as an unscrupulous toy manufacturer, can't save the picture. 
</P>
<P>
A Christmas Story (MGM/UA tape and disc) is one of the funniest films ever 
made. Humorist Jean Shepherd's reminiscences about growing up in the late 1940s 
revolves around young Shepherd's gift of his dreams for Christmas: A Red Ryder 
Carbine Action 2OO-Shot Lightning Loader Range Model Air Rifle (a BB gun). 
Peter Billingsley plays Shepherd as a boy and Shepherd himself narrates. Pure 
joy. 
</P>
<P>
Many memorable films have special Christmas celebrations. Few film endings will 
match the emotion of the Christmas ending in Frank Capra's 1946 heartwarmer 
It's a Wonderful Life (Be careful. The tape is in the public domain and many of 
the video prints are terrible. Recommended: Republic tape and disc, or the 
special edition on Criterion laser disc). Stewart is the small-town businessman 
facing ruin on Christmas Eve. The ending is pure movie magic. Skip the Hal 
Roach Studio's "colorized" print. It makes everyone look embalmed on a series 
of tinted postcards. 
</P>
<P>
The Christmas sequence in Meet Me in St. Louis (MGM/UA tape and disc) is the 
highlight of this lovely family musical. When Judy Garland sings "Have Yourself 
a Merry Little Christmas" to Margaret O'Brien, there isn't a dry eye in the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalind Russell storms through an unforgettable Christmas celebration in 
Auntie Mame (Warner tape and dasc), and the musical featuring Lucille Ball 
(Mame, Warner tape and disc) has Jerry Herman's underrated song "We Need a 
Little Christmas," a neat populist summary of why everyone loves the season. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to Christmas stories, none will ever match Dickens' A Christmas 
Carol and you can now own two of the best versions ever on film. The 1951 
black-and-white film starring Alastair Sim as Scrooge is the 86-minute British 
version that sets the standard (United). Surprisingly good is the 1938 
production featuring Reginald Owen as Scrooge (MGM/UA tape and disc). 
</P>
<P>
Scrooge, a happy musical adaptation, was made in 1970 with an all-star cast 
including Albert Finney out- rageously good in the title role and no less than 
Alec Guinness as Marley's Ghost (CBS/Fox tape and disc). 
</P>
<P>
Other films with a Yuletide theme: 
</P>
<P>
Christmas Lilies of the Field (MPI Home Video tape), a made-for-television 
sequel to the original "Lilies of the Field," featuring Billy Dee Williams in 
Sidney Poitier's Academy Award-winning role. 
</P>
<P>
A Christmas to Remember (Vestron tape) is another made-for-TV movie with a 
superior cast including Jason Robards, Eva Marie Saint and Joanne Woodward. 
It's the story of a city boy who joins his grandparents in the country for the 
holiday and learns the real meaning of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
For TV fans, there's Christmas Television Classics (Shokus tape). This video 
compilation features four 30-minute, black-and-white TV shows from the 1950s, 
including "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" (Rick sings "Christmas Song") 
and "Make Room for Daddy" (Danny Thomas is stranded out of town on Christmas 
Eve). 
</P>
<P>
If you're tired of Hollywood's interpretation of the Christmas message, you 
might try The Christmas Collection (Vanguard Video, two hours) of five films, 
including "Glory in the Highest," a drama about the birth of Christ, and "God's 
Christmas Gift" in which a girl finds the true meaning of Christmas.

STOCKING STUFFERS FOR THE KIDS

<P>
It's easy to make this a video holiday season. Christmas videos for children 
can be inexpensive and the great majority are animated. 
</P>
<P>
Many are put together poorly with lazy animation and silly songs. There are, 
however, some grand exceptions: 
</P>
<P>
Mickey's Christmas Carol (Disney tape and disc) has become a perennial 
favorite. It is a clever adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic retelling 
the story of Ebenezer Scrooge in amusing Disney terms: Scrooge McDuck (who 
else?) is the repentant miser; Mickey Mouse is Bob Cratchit; Goofy is Marley's 
Ghost; Black Pete is the Spirit of Christmas Future. 
</P>
<P>
You can't go wrong making it a Disney video Christmas. Very Merry Christmas 
Songs (Disney tape) is a genuine crowd pleaser with Mickey and the gang singing 
12 holiday favorites including "Deck the Halls" and "The 12 Days of Christmas." 
Other Disney releases include A Disney Christmas Gift, a collection of Yuletide 
scenes from a variety of Disney's animated classics; Jiminy Cricket's 
Christmas, a celebration with Pinocchio's pint-sized conscience and his friends 
(including Mickey, Peter Pan and Snow White), and A Walt Disney Christmas, six 
vintage Disney cartoons including "The Night Before Christmas" and "Pluto's 
Christmas Tree." 
</P>
<P>
After Disney's classic animation, everything seems to go downhill, although 
some may prefer the bite of Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, a 
faithful adaptation of the children's classic (MGM/UA tape). 
</P>
<P>
There's also a collection of seven classic cartoons from the 1930s and '40s 
called Christmas Comes but Once a Year (Shokus tape, less than $13), including 
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." A vintage 1952 "Howdy Doody" TV program, in 
which Howdy and Clarabell rescue Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, is an added 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Don't dismiss other feature-length cartoons because the animation seems 
amateurish next to the Disney product. Some are worth your children's time: 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (Paramount tape) is an unexpectedly superior 
adaptation of the Dickens tale with an original musical score by Jule Styne. 
This animated special should keep you and your children satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
George and the Christmas Star (Paramount tape) is an amusing story about a 
lonely man who wants to get a star out of the sky for his Christmas tree and 
comes back with a lot more than that, including the gift of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
A Charlie Brown Christmas (HiTops tape) is one of the popular TV productions 
based on Charles Schulz's cartoon strip. Poor Charlie Brown will make any child 
feel good about being him or herself. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas on Sesame Street (Random House tape) Big Bird, Bert, Ernie and the 
rest of the gang offer intelligent commentary, and there is a surprisingly 
moving adaptation of O'Henry's classic Christmas story "The Gift of the Magi." 
</P>
<P>
You're on your own with many animated specials featuring familiar cartoon 
characters (listed below). Only choose them if your children are particular 
fans of the character. Forget any of the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Casper's First Christmas" (Worldvision tape) has the friendly ghost joined by 
Yogi Bear, Boo Boo and Huckleberry Hound; "The Berenstein Bears' Christmas 
Tree" (Nelson tape) is typical stuff with Papa Bear trying to find the perfect 
tree; "Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Great Santa Claus Caper" (MPI tape); 
"B.C.-A Special Christmas" (Nelson tape) lives up to the cartoon strip's 
potential; "Glo Friends Save Christmas" (Vestron tape) is pretty routine stuff 
only for those who bought the toys featured in the made-for-TV special; 
"Christmas Comes to Pac-Land" (Goodtimes) has Pac-Man helping Santa Claus; 
"Rudolph's and Frosty's Christmas in July," "Frosty's Winter Wonderland and the 
Leprechaun's Gold" and "Rudolph's Shiny New Year" (Lightning Vestron tape) 
feature the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Snowman in pretty silly stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Other animated videos: "Silent Night" and "The Night Before Christmas" with the 
voices of the Obendorf Boys Choir (Media tape); "Pinocchio's Christmas" 
(Vestron tape) features the voice of Alan King; "Christmastime for Teddy 
Bears," a read-along video musical; "A Star for Jeremy" (Lorimar tape) explains 
why there is a star at the top of Christmas trees; "Snow White Christmas" 
(Prism tape) brings back a poorly animated Snow White who battles a poorly 
animated Evil -ueen so the kingdom can have a Merry Christmas; Calvin, Santa's 
elf, stars in "Santa's Christmas Elf" (United Entertainment tape); "A Christmas 
Tree" and "Puss-'n'-Boots" (Prism tape) and "Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny" 
(United Entertainment tape) are more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
If you are looking for the perfect Christmas present, one that reaffirms the 
closeness of family in the best holiday tradition, then there is really only 
one to choose: A Child's Christmas in Wales (Vestron tape). This is a 
sensitive, intelligent rendering of the Dylan Thomas memoir of a Christmas Eve 
spent with parents and grandfather. Denholm Elliott is a perfect guide, and the 
cast captures Thomas' words and memories with special grace and tender ness. 
It's a home video present for the entire family to view during the holidays 
because it affirms values of family, love and the spirit of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Another live-action Christmas video is Shari's Christmas Concert (Fries tape). 
This is a one-woman tour de force by ventriloquist Shari Lewis (with an 
important assist from puppet Lamb Chop). If adults sometimes believe that Lewis 
seems at times to suffer from a terminal case of cuteness, children still adore 
her. JOE SALTZMAN

JUSTICE IN DISTRESS: A SPECIAL REPORT; 
</P>
<P>
A TRIP THROUGH THE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arrests and Bookings 
</P>
<P>
1. A trip through the labyrinth of criminal justice in Los Angeles begins when 
an arrestee is "booked" -- a process in which he is fingerprinted, photographed 
and jailed. By law, a suspect in California can be held no longer than 48 hours 
without being formally accused in court of having committed a crime. That 
leaves the police two days, excluding weekends, to prepare and present their 
case to either the City Attorney or District Attorney for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
* Misdemeanors, usually punishable by no more than a year in county jail, are 
submited to the City Attorney. 
</P>
<P>
* Felonies, more serious crimes that carry possible prison terms, are 
prosecuted by the District Attorney. 
</P>
<P>
* Some crimes known as "wobblers" can be tried as either felonies or 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
Hearings and Trials 
</P>
<P>
2. If prosecutors decline to file charges, the suspect is usually freed 
immediately. But if charges are filed, the suspect becomes a "defendant" and is 
"arraigned" in municipal court, where he is formally told of the accusations 
against him. A "preliminary hearing" then is scheduled and normally held within 
10 working days. 
</P>
<P>
During the preliminary hearing, a municipal court judge hears evidence from the 
prosecution and defense, then decides whether there is sufficient reason to 
believe that the defendant is guilty of a crime. If the judge decides there is 
insufficient evidence, the defendant is released. More often, judges finds in 
favor of "the people" or prosecution, and the matter is "set for trial." 
</P>
<P>
Defendants are legally entitled to a "speedy trial." In misdemeanors, the trial 
must begin within 45 days of arraignment, if the defendant has been released on 
bail or on his "own recognizance." If the defendant has remained in custody 
after being arrested, the trial must begin within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
All felony trials must begin within 60 days of arraignment in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Defendants in both misdemeanor and felony proceedings often "waive time," 
meaning they agree to postpone trial to give their attorneys more time to 
prepare a defense. Far more plead guilty and avoid trial in exchange for 
lighter sentences -- a process known as "plea bargaining." 
</P>
<P>
Serving Time 
</P>
<P>
3. JAIL: Because of overcrowding, defendants committed to Los Angeles County 
jails serve less than half of their court-ordered sentences. With various 
credits given to each inmate, a maximum one-year sentence translates to 155 
days. 
</P>
<P>
PRISON: Except for murderers and others who receive life sentences, convicted 
felons sent to state prison since 1976 have served what are known as 
"determinate" sentences. A judge imposes the low, mid-term or high term 
prescribed by state law. Sale of cocaine, for example, carries a minimum 
punishment of three years, a mid-term of four years, and a maximum of five 
years. A prisoner who does not cause trouble and agrees to work while in 
custody is rewarded with having his sentence reduced by one day for every day 
he serves. A three-year term in prison typically is reduced to about 1 1/2 
years.

Release

<P>
4. FROM JAIL: When jail inmates are released, nearly all are placed on 
probation, typically for one-to-three years. In that time, they must abide by 
certain rules and regulations or run the risk of being locked up again. Most 
are put on "formal" or supervised probation, in which probation officers are 
supposed to monitor their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
FROM PRISON: When a prison inmate is released, he is placed on "parole" and 
must answer to a state agent. If he does not behave himself, he can be returned 
to prison for as much as one year for every parole violation.

DICKENS NEVER TASTED ANYTHING LIKE THIS PERSIMMON PUDDING

IN COOKING, as in life, looks can be deceiving. Take steamed puddings. Though 
they appear complicated, steamed puddings are deceptively easy to prepare, 
requiring only patience and a small amount of work. Ingredients are quickly 
mixed together, poured into a buttered pudding mold, then steamed. The 
delicious concoction that emerges is a moist and elegant dessert bearing little 
resemblance to that "speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm" that Charles 
Dickens lovingly described in "A Christmas Carol." 
</P>
<P>
Once steamed, the puddings can be served immediately with hard sauce or left to 
mellow for several days, sometimes even several months, depending on the 
ingredients. With time, flavors merge, which makes a tastier pudding upon 
reheating. Steamed puddings also travel well, and they make terrific gifts.

Two types of persimmons are available from October to January--the large, 
flaming orange, acorn-shaped Hachiya and the smaller, lighter-colored, tomato- 
shaped Fuyu. Hachiyas have a tannic, acrid taste if they are eaten before the 
flesh has ripened to a soft, almost mushy consistency. The Fuyus, more delicate 
in flavor than the Hachiyas, have a firm, plum-like texture when ripe and are 
tannin-free. Both are equally delicious when used in baked goods, especially 
this steamed pudding.

The accompanying Rum Butter is also known as hard sauce. It lasts for months in 
the refrigerator and also keeps well frozen. The recipe can be doubled and 
stored in one-cup containers.

RUM BUTTER 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, sifted several times

NOTES: Pudding molds should only be filled 2/3 to 3/4 full so pudding can rise 
and expand. Always tap the pudding on counter several times to break up any air 
bubbles before tightly securing lid. Use deep, heavy stock ot or spaghetti 
cooker that is large enough to allow steam to circulate around whole pudding 
mold. Filled mold should rest on small rack, trivet or folded cloth placed on 
bottom of pot.
