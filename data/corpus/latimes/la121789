"The Simpsons," creator Matt Groening's bickering brood of animated characters 
with the bulging eyes and unsightly overbites, returns to Fox Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
In a half-hour holiday special airing at 8:30 p.m. on Channels 11 and 6, father 
Homer tries to earn some extra money for family gifts by taking a second job. 
Naturally, his good intentions go amiss . . . until he's saved by "Santa's 
Little Helper." 
</P>
<P>
Fans of the quarreling characters who have missed them on "The Tracey Ullman 
Show" can circle Jan. 14 on their 1990 calendars. That's the Sunday night when 
Fox will present the Simpsons in their own weekly series. 
</P>
<P>
Executive producer Sam Simon calls it "a full prime-time series where we think 
it's our job to tell stories and develop relationships and at the same time be 
true to the family that Matt created."

The Nov. 9 episode of "The Cosby Show" was one of the funniest shows I have 
ever seen and is destined to become a classic. Obviously, Florence Burks and 
Dorothy Dexter of Simi Valley (Viewers' Views, Dec. 3) have no sense of humor 
or have totally missed the point. Cliff Huxtable is an obstetrician who sees 
pregnant women all the time. Who else could empathize so well with the foibles 
of pregnancy and childbirth? Lighten up, ladies.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: UNITED THEY FELL RECALLING A UTOPIAN DREAM SCHEME THAT 
WAS OVER BEFORE IT STARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
CALIFORNIA, and especially its southern end, has always been fertile soil for 
crackpot political ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Upton Sinclair, the Socialist writer, was almost elected governor in the 
Depression 1930s on his EPIC (End Poverty in California) plan for 
back-to-the-land and back-to-the-factory production for use, not profit. 
</P>
<P>
In the same era, Dr. Francis Townsend took in $1 million in contributions for 
his OARP (Old Age Revolving Pensions) plan; two Hollywood advertising men 
concocted a fantastic scheme called "Ham and Eggs," which would have paid old 
people "Thirty Dollars Every Thursday" and almost had it adopted in a special 
election; this region also gave enthusiastic support to Technocracy, a movement 
that advocated turning the country over to technicians, who would know how to 
manage our technological society. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Cimring, who does not subscribe to the notion that yesterday's newspaper 
is passe, sent me a clipping from The Times of April 29, 1970, about what must 
surely have been the most bizarre and shortest-lived of our many utopian 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
The story reports an announcement by James F. Andrews, a Malibu Democrat, and 
Floyd J. Bero, a Garden Grove Republican, both 32, of a grandiose idea for 
"bringing America together." 
</P>
<P>
One week earlier, the two had taken out a full-page ad in The Times to 
introduce what they called Yuni -- an abbreviation of "You and I." So far, they 
said, they had received 5,000 letters and post cards pledging support. 
</P>
<P>
Their plan was simple, if wildly presumptuous: They hoped to enlist 2 million 
supporters, at which point they would ask 10 prominent persons (nine men and 
one woman) to serve on their board of directors and "take the first step toward 
the creation of a master plan to solve the critical problems facing America 
today." 
</P>
<P>
The 10 persons, none of whom, evidently, had ever heard of Yuni until they read 
their names in the paper, were certainly among the most distinguished figures 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
They were Simon Ramo, Buckminster Fuller, William Pickering, John Diebold, 
Thomas J. Watson Jr., Walter Cronkite, Bill Cosby, Corita Kent, Ricardo 
Montalban and Norton Simon. 
</P>
<P>
The story said that those of the 10 who could be reached by telephone said they 
had never heard of Andrews and Bero, nor of Yuni, and had not been approached 
by them. 
</P>
<P>
The chutzpah of the two young men is evident in their explanation that they had 
indeed nominated the 10 without their prior knowledge, but that they were 
"quite encouraged that we haven't heard from any of them" demanding that their 
names be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews and Bero said they had quit their jobs and spent $25,000 of their own 
money on the plan, and that they did not intend to solicit contributions. They 
declined to define their goals, saying only that they would be left up to the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea what their program will be. It's irrelevant and a waste of 
energy to argue about which method is really right when America is so 
critically out of balance. 
</P>
<P>
"We must get on with it and find the people who can bring us all together. We 
only need a master plan." 
</P>
<P>
It was simply an appeal to our elders to lead us out of the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Wondering what had happened to Yuni, I asked The Times' library to see if we 
had carried any later stories about it. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, on May 31, only 32 days after the first story had appeared, a second 
story reported Yuni's sad demise. 
</P>
<P>
The headline said: "Yuni Dies -- and With It a Quixotic Dream." 
</P>
<P>
The story reported that "the lease expired at the Yuni Co. office Saturday, and 
Bero was trying to figure out how to sell the office furniture to pay the phone 
bill. . . . Gloom dominated . . . as Bero waited, not really expectantly, for 
some famous American to walk through the door and solve all the problems. No 
one came." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 prominent persons nominated to serve, only three -- Montalban, Simon 
and Watson -- had acknowledged Yuni's invitation. They said they did not wish 
to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Cimring notes, philosophically, that on the day the first story appeared, the 
Dow Jones average was 711 (contrasted with a recent 2,700-plus), and the volume 
of stock traded was 12.62 million shares (contrasted with 160 million-plus). 
</P>
<P>
Thus, to EPIC, OARP, Ham and Eggs, Thirty Dollars Every Thursday and Yuni -- 
R.I.P.

PRIVATE LIVES: CHRISTMAS AT TIFFANY'S; 
</P>
<P>
FORGET THE APPLIANCES AND GAG GIFTS. IT'S JEWELRY WE ADORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MEN! ARE you wondering what to get that special lady for Christmas or Hanukkah? 
I can cut your agony in half. Buy gems. In my experience, almost all women want 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
"You really believe that a man's natural function is to be a jewel buyer?" asks 
my husband, Duke. 
</P>
<P>
Let me put it like this. If you're absolutely certain that your beloved has her 
heart set on a specific item -- a red Mazda Miata, for example, or a suede 
jacket, a crystal ball, a flacon of Poison, a cashmere sweater, or even one of 
those limited-edition collector plates -- then buy it with my blessing. But if 
you're just going to wander aimlessly around the shopping mall, eyes glazed, 
neurons malfunctioning, trying to decide among a basket of cheese balls, a 
hair-removal machine and a copy of "The Curmudgeon's Garden of Love," then run 
-- do not walk -- to her favorite jeweler. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain amount of resistance to spending large sums of money on 
little tiny things," says Duke. "A man can buy something that fits into a 
matchbox, or he can buy a truck." 
</P>
<P>
He'll get a lot more mileage out of the matchbox. Very few women want a truck 
-- or many of the other popular gift items foisted upon us at this time of 
year. Recently, I went to a department store. I was riding down the escalator 
when I noticed an enormous display of artificial daisies arranged around a 
large-screen television set. That's strange, I thought. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was stranger than I thought. A close inspection revealed that the 
daisies, some of which were wearing sunglasses and / or bow ties, were swaying 
in time to a Janet Jackson music video. A festive banner proclaimed that these 
were "Rock 'N Flowers" and that they cost "only" $29.95. "Everybody's buying 
them for Christmas," said the salesman. "They're perfect gifts for children, 
for men, and especially for women." 
</P>
<P>
Not this woman. (Or any other woman I know.) Frankly, the last thing I want for 
Christmas is a hyperactive fake bloom (especially when for the same price I 
could have a few dozen real blooms). I realize that I sound like an ingrate. 
But I don't like joke gifts. I don't understand what you're supposed to do with 
joke gifts, except titter politely when you open the pre-wrapped package, and 
then (later) shove it in the back of your closet. 
</P>
<P>
"If you yell at Rock 'N Flower, it wiggles," the salesman said. Who cares? I've 
never wanted to holler at a flower. And neither have any of my girlfriends. On 
the other hand, many of us have always wanted to own some breathtaking bijou -- 
a marquise sapphire ring, perhaps, or a turquoise Zuni fetish necklace, a pair 
of silver earrings or an Art Deco Cartier brooch. Or a 14-karat-gold charm 
bracelet, like the one I tried on in Beverly Hills the other day. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you feel guilty wanting jewelry when we're about to kill the last 
rhinoceros on the planet?" asks my friend Monica, who secretly wants an emerald 
necklace. Of course I feel guilty. Every woman with a semblance of a social 
conscience (and / or children to put through college) feels guilty for desiring 
some precious or semiprecious bagatelle. Still, it was a really pretty charm 
bracelet . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It was a really pretty necklace," Monica says with a sigh. "And it was on 
sale." 
</P>
<P>
Even so . . . . "There's a certain tendency among men to buy something useful," 
says Duke. "Something that might have a ricochet effect back to the giver -- 
like a really good torque wrench or a set of weights." Or a Swiss army knife, 
like the one he gave me for Christmas the first year we were married. (I almost 
used it to slit his throat.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's the feminine model," Duke said as he proudly showed me the nail file, the 
scissors, the orange zester and the teeny tweezers. It's the thought that 
counts, I sullenly reminded myself. And, in all fairness, I must admit that the 
knife was (and still is) extremely practical. But . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Women don't want things that are so useful," my friend Mary shrieks. "Like a 
plumber's snake, or 'Here, honey, all gift-wrapped, a thing for your steering 
wheel that locks it so nobody can steal your car,' or 'Just for you, my 
darling, an attachment for the Electrolux.' " (And, in general, few women are 
truly dazzled by anything that plugs in.) 
</P>
<P>
"I want something that comes in a small but suspiciously heavy box," says Mary, 
who has no shame. "A little something for the toe of the stocking. Like a 
Faberge Imperial Easter egg. Or an 8-carat emerald-cut flawless diamond. 'Oh 
thanks, honey. Look how it sparkles on the little paw.' " 
</P>
<P>
For the record, not all women like, or even want, a gigantic sparkler, though I 
don't know too many who would return one (they might have it reset). In 
baubles, as in cars, taste varies. Some women prefer ethnic jewelry or antique 
jewelry or costume jewelry or wearable artsy jewelry -- so make sure that you 
pick up the subtle hints ("I want that"). But whatever kind of jewelry you buy 
. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's irrevocably the woman's, not yours," says Duke. "She takes it. She hides 
it. She has it. And she never gives it back. At least, if you give a woman a 
car, you can use the car. But you can never use the jewels." 
</P>
<P>
That's what makes them so special. "It's a nice feeling to know that a man went 
into a jewelry store, which to him is like alien territory," says my sister 
Laurie. "It's one thing for him to go into a lingerie store. That's pretty 
self-serving. But for him to go into a jewelry store when he doesn't get 
anything out of it except the fact that you're wearing jewelry . . . that's 
wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
You bet. "I suppose that a man can rationalize it as being an investment if 
he's dumb," says Duke, who not too long ago rationalized an exquisite Edwardian 
choker that I'd been dreaming about for two years. I was very, very grateful. 
"I like it that it gives you so much pleasure," my husband admits. "So I 
controlled my hyperventilation and wrote the check." 
</P>
<P>
Still, I don't see him writing a check for my charm bracelet in the very near 
future. Not unless I really step up the hints. "A charm bracelet?" Duke says, 
when I casually remark that I'd seen one. "Aren't they mostly for high school 
students?" 
</P>
<P>
Oh, well, maybe next Christmas.

THE PLUGGED-IN ARCHBISHOP; 
</P>
<P>
ROGER MAHONY MINISTERS WITH COMPUTERS, A HELICOPTER AND FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CIOTTI, Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IT'S 10 O'CLOCK in the morning at Van Nuys Airport. Roman Catholic Archbishop 
Roger M. Mahony settles into the cockpit of his blue-and-white Hughes 500D 
four-passenger jet helicopter, offers a brief silent prayer, then fires up the 
turbine, eases up on the collective and lifts lightly off the flight line. He 
rotates right, pours on the power and climbs out to the northwest at maximum 
torque into a warm, hazy morning. Ten minutes later he's zipping along 1,000 
feet above Interstate 5 on his way to Bakersfield, pointing out landmarks like 
a Hollywood tour guide. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony says his frequent flights over the 8,300 square miles of his archdiocese 
reveal a growing gap between those who have jobs and houses and opportunities 
and those who don't. "I see this anomaly from the air. The inner city seems 
more like a war zone. You look at whole burned-out blocks and wonder how 
anybody can survive in that area. Then you see them rearranging mountains and 
valleys to put in new houses, and I think, geez, why are we taking all those 
mountains down and filling up the valleys when we really could do something in 
our communities? The opportunities for the residents are so different in those 
two areas. The gap is wide and getting ever wider." 
</P>
<P>
Four-and-a-half years into his job as head of the largest archdiocese in 
America, Mahony has grown adept at negotiating that gap between the rich and 
the poor. Unlike some of his predecessors, he has rejected the ornate trappings 
that accompany his post and lives downtown at the rectory of St. Vibiana's 
Cathedral with five other priests, in the heart of Skid Row. His goal for Los 
Angeles, he says, is to reawaken an appreciation for God in a society inundated 
with material goods. "The Church has set out a vision of the responsibilities 
of society to the poor," he says, "and we really do fall short of many of those 
challenges and goals." He is passionate about what he sees as one of his 
primary missions: addressing the needs of immigrants and refugees and making 
them feel welcome. 
</P>
<P>
But he has also chosen to court, not chide, the high-finance power brokers of 
Los Angeles whom he can call upon when, for instance, he needs food and 
medicine for an emergency airlift to El Salvador, a $100-million endowment for 
the parochial schools -- or the $395,000 helicopter that critics regard as a 
galling symbol of how comfortable he's become with wealth and power. 
</P>
<P>
"I model myself on the example of Christ," says Mahony. "He moved freely among 
the lepers and the outcasts on one hand, and had dinner with the Pharisees and 
leaders of the community on the other, and felt very much at home with all 
people." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a rare mixture of an organization man and a populist," says attorney and 
venture capitalist Richard Riordan, who put together the financing for Mahony's 
helicopter after Mahony got caught in gridlock one too many times. "He's very 
pragmatic. He understands that you don't help the poor by destroying business. 
And that you have to create wealth before you redistribute it." Furthermore, 
Riordan says, Mahony enjoys wielding his authority. "You have to enjoy power to 
be in the position he is in." 
</P>
<P>
It is clear, as Mahony looks out over the city and reflects on his ability to 
change it, that he does enjoy his job and the direct way in which he can apply 
his influence. In a governmental system of competing interest groups and 
overlapping bureaucracies, he asks, "what kind of power do you have in terms of 
being able to get things done?" By comparison, the archdiocese can act swiftly. 
"I can cut through red tape very quickly," he says, "and I don't think there is 
any equivalent position like it. I don't have to deal with the City Council or 
the county Board of Supervisors. I have the ability to make a phone call, write 
a letter and get something moving." When it comes to getting things done, he 
says, "there is something to be said for a hierarchical system." 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE THE aplomb with which he functions today, Mahony wasn't someone who was 
tagged for greatness early. "He wasn't real dynamic," says Gerald Fallon, a 
former priest and theologian who attended St. John's Seminary in Camarillo with 
Mahony. "Roger was just a hard-working guy. He looked like he would do a good 
job. But I don't think anyone imagined that he would be the archbishop of Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony grew up, one of three children, in North Hollywood, where his father 
worked as an electrician for Universal Studios and then ran a small 
poultry-processing plant. "Even in grammar school, I remember wanting to be a 
priest," says Mahony, who entered the seminary at 14, influenced by his 
parish's enthusiastic, newly ordained priests "who were interested in the 
kids." He also began to develop his deep connection with the Spanish-speaking 
community. At his father's poultry plant, shoveling chicken manure with Mexican 
workers, Mahony first began to speak Spanish. And as a seminarian, "I used to 
go with the priests when they went to celebrate Masses in farm labor camps 
around Camarillo, so there were a lot of hands-on opportunities to learn the 
language." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony was ordained in 1962 and sent to Catholic University in Washington, 
where he got a master's degree in social work, specializing in administration 
and community organizing, "because I knew that's what I was supposed to be 
doing when I got back." He returned to become director of Catholic Charities in 
Fresno. In 1965, Cesar Chavez was organizing workers in the grape fields, and 
throughout the San Joaquin Valley "there was a great deal of tension between 
Catholic workers and Catholic growers." Mahony, who subsequently became the 
Fresno secretary of the National Catholic Bishops Committee on Farm Labor, 
quickly discovered the facts of political life. 
</P>
<P>
"In these small towns, the large (church) contributors would be the growers. 
The grower community had access to the political leadership. The judges were 
supported strongly by the grower community. It was very difficult to proclaim 
the rights of the workers and find a way to protect those rights since 
agriculture was specifically excluded from the National Labor Relations Act. It 
was essential (to find) a way to deal with this -- particularly since there was 
no state or public agency available. I had to bend over backwards to be 
impartial. But even that was not always perceived as that." 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1975, then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. signed the Agricultural Labor 
Relations Act, which was designed to resolve disputes between farm workers and 
growers. Mahony was on a long-scheduled pilgrimage to Rome, and when he 
returned, "one of the first things I was interested in was who was on the 
board. I discovered that (Brown) still hadn't appointed a board. The act was 
going into effect Aug. 28. Here it was July, and I discovered there was no 
board, no rules, no regulations. I was a bit alarmed by that. I expressed 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Then all of a sudden, I got a call from the governor's office. He asked would 
I come up. He wanted me to serve on the board." 
</P>

So in early August, Mahony went to Sacramento. During the next year, the board 
conducted more than 400 farm-worker elections under the most volatile 
conditions. "He managed to keep open communication with all sides," says LeRoy 
Chatfield, director of the Loaves &amp; Fishes shelter for the homeless in 
Sacramento, who was, at the time, working for the United Farmworkers. "And I 
think history will note that he did a good job in bringing something productive 
and positive out of a very tense and violence-prone situation." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony's abilities did not go unnoticed by the Church hierarchy, and in 1980 he 
was appointed bishop of Stockton. Despite his base in a sleepy backwater of a 
diocese, Mahony's voice was one that was heard increasingly throughout the 
American Church. He took stands on the duty of the country to help the poor, on 
the teaching authority of the Church and on the need to end nuclear 
proliferation. He held firm to Church doctrine, mirroring Pope John Paul II 
with his combination of liberalism on economic issues and conservatism on 
Church teachings. He was in many ways a perfect candidate for the fast track in 
a church looking to revitalize itself in America by appealing to immigrants, 
particularly those from Latin America -- and to compete with Protestant 
evangelical denominations that were luring those immigrants away. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the apostolic pro-nuncio, the Vatican's Washington representative, 
called Mahony at his cabin in the Sierra to ask if he would accept appointment 
as the next archbishop of Los Angeles. He was so overwhelmed by the offer, he 
says, that he went for a three-hour walk in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
FOR SOMEONE WHO wields as much authority as he does, Roger Mahony is not 
physically imposing. He's tall, thin and stoop-shouldered, wears oversize 
eyeglasses and seems to smile more than necessary. In an outdoor religious 
procession, he has the quaint air of someone on a pilgrimage, walking slowly, 
leaning forward, using his shepherd's crosier like a walking stick. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't take himself too seriously or stand on a lot of ego," says 
Chatfield. "He's relatively unflappable. He also chooses his words very 
carefully. He's not given to rhetoric, so he doesn't inflame either side 
unduly. He doesn't take abuse. He speaks with respect, but he fully expects you 
to do the same. And if you don't, he calls you on it. He doesn't roll over. He 
is a very political kind of guy. I'm not using that in a pejorative sense. He 
is sensitive to what is possible, to what people can or cannot do. He is a 
church statesman." Mahony is a man of simple tastes. Except for a crucifix, a 
thermometer and a cross-country ski machine he uses three times a week, his 
bedroom is so barren of any personal touches that it has the feel of a 
business-class hotel room. He earns a salary of $600 a month. In his closet are 
a neat row of vestments, some jackets, trousers, a pair of running shoes, old 
loafers and not much else. He makes his own bed and, if he uses the last bit of 
milk in the upstairs pantry, goes down to the main kitchen and brings up more 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's an authentic person," says Fallon. "There's no guile in him. What 
you see is what you get." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his predecessor, Cardinal Timothy Manning, a quiet, shy, gentle man who 
gave inspired sermons, being inspirational doesn't always come easily to 
Mahony. There's one point during Mass when the priest looks out over the 
congregation, spreads his arms and says, "Peace be with you." But the way 
Mahony does it, it looks as if he's trying too hard. He leans forward with a 
loving smile, says, "PEACE!" and then he stops. You don't have a clue where he 
is going with it. Then about half a beat too late, he chimes in with the rest 
of it -- "be with you." 
</P>
<P>
Although his job is to help prepare people for the next world, Mahony is 
remarkably down-to-earth about this one. When he sees a traffic jam on the 
freeway, he reports it to local radio stations. At his cabin in the Sierra, he 
often walks around with a carpenter's belt, installing exhaust fans and fixing 
the drains. When a workman did a sloppy job on a fire alarm for St. Vibiana's 
rectory, Mahony pulled out a screwdriver and rewired it himself. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony is not really a sophisticated conversationalist -- he's the kind of 
person who tells the punch line of a joke twice, laughing all the while -- but 
he's so warm, good-natured and diffident that it hardly makes any difference. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, says Terry Sweeney, a former Jesuit priest who found himself 
in a confrontation with the archbishop for conducting a survey of American 
bishops on the subject of celibacy, if you challenge Church doctrine, "he 
becomes direct, factual, unemotional and cold." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony is more than willing to look people in the eye and tell them that 
something "is completely unacceptable," says former archdiocese communications 
director Joe Battaglia. Unlike Manning, who went out of his way to avoid 
confrontations, Mahony sometimes seems to thrive on them. "Or at least," says 
Battaglia, "when they come, he doesn't back away." He makes decisions quickly, 
and as a result "he sometimes fires from the hip." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does he always consider the political consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Before Jerry Brown appointed Rose Bird as Chief Justice of California, Mahony, 
who had worked with Bird when she was state agricultural director, sent a 
letter to the commissioner of judicial appointments calling her "vindictive" 
and of "questionable emotional stability." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, when the publisher of The Times wrote to Mahony asking what he 
thought of the paper's new format, he wrote back to praise the paper's 
reporting, and then took the occasion to lambaste The Times for "the arrogance" 
of "its ultra-liberal editorial policy. You do not even credit intelligence to 
those with a more moderate approach . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable church insiders say it is practically certain that Mahony will be 
made a cardinal, though it might not happen immediately. American archbishops 
don't generally become cardinals until about age 60; Mahony is only 53. Unless 
he were appointed to some position in the Vatican bureaucracy, he will most 
likely serve as head of the archdiocese until he's 75, in the year 2011. Then, 
he says, he'll retire to a small house next to a rectory somewhere in Los 
Angeles "and go back to being a parish priest." 
</P>
<P>
BASED ON HIS concern for migrant workers and refugees, the liberal community in 
Los Angeles had great expectations for Mahony when he first arrived from the 
San Joaquin Valley. But as soon as he started associating with the wealthy and 
powerful of Los Angeles, it seemed to some that he had changed. "He has been a 
consistent disappointment to those of us who expected him to be more 
progressive," says activist attorney Gloria Allred. 
</P>
<P>
The litany of Mahony's supposed affronts to liberals has grown long over the 
years: He urged Catholics to boycott 7-Eleven stores for selling Playboy 
magazine. He took what to some former priests looked like a needlessly 
unyielding stance on married priests, suppressing a survey of American bishops 
on optional celibacy and banning Sweeney, its author, from Holy Communion. He 
appeared on "Nightline" to denounce the use of condoms, even for preventing 
AIDS, a stance that so enraged some gay activists that they splattered four 
Catholic churchs with red paint early in December and plastered a poster on 
church doors calling Mahony a "murderer." Mahony banned Dignity, an 
organization of gay and lesbian Catholics, from holding Masses in archdiocesan 
facilities. Then he sent a letter to all the priests in the diocese, ordering 
them not to say Masses for the organization, a move that longtime gay activist 
Morris Kight says he finds "uncharitable, unloving, lacking in compassion. I 
thought he might be a gentle voice, but he has simply followed the rulings of 
the Vatican in automatic response." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony took it as a personal affront when an overwhelming majority of the 
archdiocese's 142 cemetery workers asked to be represented by the Amalgamated 
Clothing and Textile Workers Union in July, 1988. In a move that distressed his 
labor supporters, he fought the issue, contested jurisdiction and accused the 
union of anti-Catholic attacks on both himself and the Church. "He has a lot of 
schooling, but he doesn't know how to treat workers," says Jose Aranda, a 
pro-union cemetery worker fired by Mahony for alleged misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, Mahony's stands on all these issues have made some people start 
to wonder about the archbishop's real goals. "He's a church political animal," 
says Bill Kenkelen, West Coast correspondent for the liberal National Catholic 
Reporter, "and he wants that red hat and he wants it soon. If there's anything 
consistent about Mahony, it is that he's ambitious. He was a liberal in the 
'60s, when it was profitable to be a liberal. And now under this Pope, it's 
advantageous to be conservative." 
</P>
<P>
The problem isn't that Mahony is inconsistent, says Father Thomas Reese, a 
Jesuit and a fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center in Washington and the 
author of "Archbishop," a new book on American archbishops. Rather, he says, 
people make assumptions about bishops that aren't warranted: "There is that 
fallacy that if a person is against nuclear weapons, for civil rights and in 
favor of a nuclear freeze, then he is going to be a so-called liberal on 
abortion and pornography and other issues. But bishops are not liberal 
Democrats -- they are coming out of a Christian perspective." 
</P>
<P>
The moral issue Mahony deals with most forcefully is that of abortion. There 
certainly is no doubt about his commitment to the issue. He speaks on the 
subject as often as four times a day. He has attended rallies for Operation 
Rescue, an anti-abortion protest organization, and has urged police to show the 
greatest restraint when arresting the protesters. Of increasing concern to 
many, he has stepped into the political arena, sending a letter to state 
legislators in June that declared that all Catholic officeholders "have a 
positive moral obligation to work for the repeal of pro-choice legislation. . . 
. There is no other legitimate position. There is no such thing as a Catholic 
pro-choice public official." In November, after San Diego Bishop Leo T. Mahler 
banned Assemblywoman Lucy Killea from Holy Communion for her pro-choice views, 
Mahony kept open the possibility that he might take similar action, saying: "If 
a Catholic legislator comes out and says, 'I consider myself a good Catholic, 
but I strongly support abortion,' I would say this can't be. Those are mutually 
exclusive. We use sanctions in a very limited way, but this (taking a vocal 
pro-choice stand) might be an exception." 
</P>
<P>
It's too simple to say Catholics must submit to every teaching statement of 
Church authorities, Mahony has said, but they are "expected to give . . . 
internal and external, private and public assent to magisterial teaching that 
is clearly within the time-honored tradition." And abortion, he says, 
definitely falls into that category. "Talk about constant teaching of the 
Church," he says, "that goes back to the 1st Century. You've got all those 
people talking about abortion in AD 106. If there has ever been an issue on 
which we never had a different position, it is this one." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony is disturbed by the nature of some of the criticism directed toward him. 
"People don't think you are acting in good faith," says Mahony. "It even isn't 
that they discount what you say -- they write you off entirely." 
</P>
<P>
To women faced with unwanted pregnancies, "I say, 'Don't compound the problems 
by making a new problem for yourself: the guilt, the anguish that you will 
never get over." The Church will be happy to place the baby for adoption, help 
to raise the child and to help feed it, he says. "But more than just taking 
care of the baby is the underlying moral issue. Once you say that it's all 
right to take any human life, then all human life is in danger. At first, the 
Nazis said we are only interested in getting rid of the top Jewish leaders; 
then they said just those who own shops; then before long, every human being 
was at risk." 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of homosexuality, Mahony says he never had any vendetta against 
gays. The Dignity organization, he says, forced him to take a stand by adopting 
a new policy in 1987, that suggested that one could be both a sexually active 
homosexual and a good Catholic. That stance, he says "offered us no choice." 
Homosexual relationships are "an issue that was never debated seriously in the 
church, ever." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony's critics don't deny that a lot of what he's done is commendable. He's 
built homeless shelters and opened three residential care facilities for people 
with AIDS. He spoke out strongly against evictions of illegal aliens from 
public housing, against a prison in East Los Angeles and against employer 
sanctions for hiring undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
He mobilized the Church to help thousands of applicants fill out their paper 
work under the amnesty program. After six Jesuits were killed in El Salvador, 
he personally organized a relief effort to send a plane with 40,000 pounds of 
food and medical supplies and in late November flew to El Salvador, both to 
appeal for peace and to be sure that the supplies actually got to the 
Salvadoran church. 
</P>
<P>
Although some claim to see an element of calculation in everything Mahony does, 
others say that what critics see as calculation is really the centered calm of 
a deep faith. "He has a very prayerful nature," says Mahony's secretary, Father 
Kevin Kostelnik. "He prays from 6 to 7 in the chapel every morning. It's the 
only time I can't disturb him. He draws a lot of strength from that." 
</P>
<P>
What does he pray about? "Oftentimes," says Mahony, "my prayer is just a prayer 
of emptiness: 'So many things are swirling about that I haven't a clue what to 
do next. Lord, just be with me. Just guide me. Show me the way.' Cardinal Basil 
Hume of London has a marvelous prayer, and he calls it his prayer of 
incompetence. And I really feel that's my best prayer: 'Lord, I don't know what 
to make of all this. Or what to do. Lord, be with me and give me strength.' 
Many times I just sit in the chapel and say, 'Come, Lord Jesus. Come, Lord 
Jesus.' Nothing more than that." 
</P>
<P>
MAHONY WAS MADE archbishop of Los Angeles in September, 1985. For someone whose 
last assignment was Stockton, it was a bit of a leap -- the archdiocese 
stretches from Lompoc to Pomona. "I was just not prepared for the size of Los 
Angeles," he says. The first time he met with the 39 members of the priest 
senate (representing the archdiocese's 1,340 priests), Mahony observed that 
"there are as many priests on the senate here as there are in my entire 
archdiocese in Stockton." 
</P>
<P>
Nine months later, as a way of showing his commitment to the Church's enormous 
Latino community, Mahony held a convocation and Mass for 50,000 Latino 
Catholics in Dodger Stadium. "It was an occasion of extraordinary reverence," 
says Battaglia. There was a long procession of priests, deacons and acolytes, 
and bringing up the rear, in a borrowed miter and vestments, was Roger Mahony. 
The only problem was that his miter was too big. "It looked like if he turned 
his head too fast, it might not come with him," says Battaglia. Down on the 
infield, Mahony was dwarfed in the huge stadium. "You could see him close up on 
Diamond Vision (scoreboard TV)," Battaglia recalls, and "it was like he was 
thinking, 'This isn't Stockton anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
If Mahony was surprised by the Los Angeles archdiocese, the archdiocese in turn 
was astonished by Mahony. The chancery staff had been used to Manning's 
laid-back management style, and here came the new man with his personal 
computer, pumping out memos, letters and documents in a paper tornado. Whenever 
he made a trip to Washington or New York, he carried a Federal Express 
envelope. He would answer mail on the plane. And when he landed, he would send 
the envelope back to his office. Although the archdiocese has 12,000 employees, 
a $295-million annual budget and $3 billion in assets, the chancery essentially 
had no personnel office, no computers and no modern accounting system when 
Mahony took over. Suddenly, the new archbishop was laser-printing his own 
letters and making his own telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Moving decisively to take control of the archdiocese, Mahony brought in a board 
of financial experts to advise him. He took priests out of administrative 
positions and replaced them with lay professionals, hired management 
consultants, appointed women to high positions on his staff and introduced 
computers, salary surveys and a dozen other changes. 
</P>
<P>
But for some of his problems, he could see no quick administrative solutions. 
For one thing, he can't simply hire a headhunting firm to find replacements for 
the dwindling number of priests who serve Los Angeles' burgeoning Catholic 
population. The shortage is a serious one: In 1940, the ratio of priests to 
Catholics in the archdiocese was 1 to 500. Now it's closer to 1 to 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
While some former priests suggest that the Church's insistence on celibacy is 
at the root of what's called the vocation crisis, Mahony believes that the 
fundamental cause is that our society discourages lifelong commitment and 
sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he says he has managed to turn things around in his archdiocese, and 
right now "we how have 140 students in the theology department -- the highest 
number in the history of (St. John's) seminary." In two years, he says, the 
problem won't be a shortage of priests, but a lack of new facilities to house 
all the students. Besides, he adds, numbers alone are misleading. "Parishes now 
have large full-time staffs. The priest once was the choir director, director 
of religious education -- he did everything. He was it. Now we have 
professionally trained lay people who handle many of these things, so we really 
don't need the same number of priests." 
</P>
<P>
An equally thorny personnel problem is Mahony's stormy relationship with the 
archdiocese's cemetery workers. People in organized labor who had viewed Mahony 
as an ally because of his experience with the farm workers are highly 
distressed that he did not support the cemetery workers' attempt to organize. 
</P>
<P>
Why didn't he? 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Mahony," says William Robertson, executive secretary-treasurer of 
the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. "He said, well, if it were 
a union that had conducted a clean organizing campaign, he wouldn't have any 
problem. But it was the way this union went about it. They took on the Catholic 
Church. He was angry. He said some people said the Church was hypocritical. He 
didn't want to have anything to do with this union." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone, including Mahony, agreed that the workers had just grievances. They 
were poorly paid. After 11 years, one man was making only $5.75 per hour. They 
had to pay $45 every two weeks for family health insurance. Then, just before 
Christmas, 1987, the workers discovered that Mahony had eliminated their annual 
$300 bonus. The union put out a flier suggesting that Mahony used the bonuses 
to pay for the Pope's visit. Mahony says he didn't object to the workers having 
a union if that was what they chose of their own free will. But in this 
election, he says, the pro-union side was out of control, smashing windshields, 
threatening co-workers. It was true, says Mahony, that he took away the 
Christmas bonus but that was only because, when he took over, he discovered 
that the archdiocese had a policy of paying the cemetery workers sub-standard 
wages and then trying to make it up to them with the bonus. 
</P>
<P>
To Mahony, this seemed patronizing. "In justice we had to give people a living 
wage (all year)," he says. So starting in 1987, Mahony increased cemetery 
workers' wages and eliminated the bonus. Unfortunately, says Mahony, the 
archdiocese didn't have a personnel department at the time. No one explained 
the new policy to the cemetery workers in Spanish. Then when Christmas came, 
the word spread that Mahony had used their bonus money to pay for the Pope's 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so outrageous," says Mahony. "We made money on the Pope's visit" -- 
$70,000 to $80,000 profit. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Mahony vowed never to work with the union. Though the union won the 
election, Mahony says he will set up a three-person panel to handle all 
negotiations. Furthermore, Mahony told the cemetery workers in a videotaped 
message: "If you tell me, through words or any other way, that you no longer 
want to be represented by the union, I am available to listen and also to work 
with you to resolve this situation." 
</P>
<P>
The ideal archbishop, Mahony says, quoting "Archbishop" author Reese, "should 
be involved in national and international affairs of the church and society -- 
but never be gone more than two days a year." Mahony scores well on the 
involvement front, serving on a bewildering variety of boards and commissions, 
and forever flying off to New York, the Middle East or Southeast Asia, drafting 
papers for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. Among other American 
bishops, Mahony is well regarded, according to Reese. "They see him as very 
bright, articulate and hard-working," he says, which is why they gave him the 
difficult and delicate task of drafting papers for their national conferences 
on AIDS and the Middle East (the AIDS paper rejected the use of condoms for 
preventing AIDS; the Middle East paper recommended the establishment of a 
Palestinian state). 
</P>
<P>
But at the end of every trip, he returns to St. Vibiana's and the unavoidable 
reminders of the increasing demands on his resources in Los Angeles. "In the 
area where the chancery is, there are people sleeping in refrigerator cartons. 
Fires on the streets. We can't keep up with it, no matter how many 
single-room-occupancy hotels get refurbished, no matter how many shelters. The 
social problems are becoming more difficult. And the despair rate is becoming 
more pronounced." Those concerns are always with him, says Mahony, as is a 
steady stream of paper work. When his administrative tasks threaten to 
overwhelm, he says, he takes comfort in a prayer Pope John XXIII used to say 
before retiring: "There are sure a lot of problems in your Church, Lord. But 
they are Your problems. You can handle it. I'm going to bed." "When you think 
about it," he says, "that's a very profound prayer." 
</P>
<P>
IN A CROSS-COUNTRY flight aboard a commercial airliner, Mahony reflected 
recently on his progress as archbishop. Although he is sometimes portrayed as 
cracking down on deviations from Church teaching with unreserved glee, no 
archbishop enjoys this part of his job, says Mahony. "It would be far easier to 
pretend there isn't any problem." But that is what's wrong with our society, he 
says. "Nobody is willing to say that something is right and something is 
wrong," and anyone who does is immediately attacked. 
</P>
<P>
What Mahony sees as a major wrong in Los Angeles is its materialistic culture. 
"Where I am most alarmed," he says, "is with new immigrants. They come here 
with very close family ties -- and within no time, you see this family get 
caught up in the search for the material goods. It tends to break up the 
family. Each of us has to stop from time to time and ask, 'What am I spending 
money on? What consumes me? What is important to me?' 
</P>
<P>
"In the Third World countries or in rural parts of this country," he says, 
"there is a bond between creation, earth, cycles of crops and planting that 
keeps people much more in touch with creation and automatically keeps us linked 
to God. But in our society, people haven't got a clue where the water comes 
from that is coming out of their faucets. They have no idea where the food 
comes from. The idea of a cow is so remote. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in an instant information society. A disaster somewhere will be on the 
6 o'clock news in living color. The world has shrunk in so many dimensions that 
we see ourselves really as the cause of what happens. We look at technology and 
we say how brilliant we are: We are gods with a small g. And the temptation is 
that you, too, can become the beginning and ending of your own existence. You 
think that you really created your life and everything that happened to you: 'I 
am self-sufficient. I don't need to be sustained by a creator.' 
</P>
<P>
"What I would say is that we have to take a look at the family -- what's 
happening to children, parents. I see this in family counseling. An eminently 
successful businessman was in counseling because he was never at home. He says, 
'What I was trying to do was to work around the clock to buy them everything. 
And what they wanted from me was my time.' " When asked if he has thus far made 
a dent in the materialistic culture of Southern California, Mahony thinks for a 
second and softly says, "Not really." Still, he says, he does believe that it 
is possible to "redo, reshape and re-create the human community. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't have hope," he says, "I'd probably write to the Pope and ask him 
to send me back to the Valley."

WHAT DO you need? Come on, what do you need?" 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stupak is holding court in a well-padded corner booth at Kelly &amp; Cohen, 
one of the four restaurants on the premises of his hotel-casino empire. It's 
shortly after 5 in the afternoon on a Tuesday, but the work of a casino magnate 
is never done -- not in Las Vegas, anyway, and certainly not at Bob Stupak's 
Vegas World, one of the busiest casinos in town. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the problem?" Stupak asks as two of his associates approach him for a 
chat. "Is there a problem?" 
</P>
<P>
The pair take turns outlining the problem. Vegas World is in the final stages 
of adding a second hotel tower to the existing complex, famous for its gaudy 
casino: an otherworldly encounter with angrily buzzing red planets, 
gold-speckled galaxies and silvery satellites suspended from the ceiling, piles 
of money encased in Lucite and mirrors, mirrors, mirrors. Some minor design 
alterations in the new plans require an architect's approval before work can 
proceed, but at the moment, Vegas World has no architect. 
</P>
<P>
Stupak stares impassively at the pair of aides. Finally, he shakes his head and 
says, "I can't believe we're having this conversation. We already had this 
conversation. I put an ad in the paper. We're interviewing. What else can I 
do?" 
</P>
<P>
He turns to a visitor and shakes his head again. "Can you believe this?" he 
asks. "Ten years ago, we had 90 rooms; now we have a thousand, with another 600 
on the drawing board. When I started expanding in 1983, there was a recession 
going on, a gas crunch, and there were five casinos in bankruptcy all at the 
same time. Everybody was out of work. Now it's hard to even find people to bid 
for the job." 
</P>
<P>
Stupak's amazement is understandable. These days, it's easier to draw two cards 
to fill an inside straight than to find Las Vegas architects with time on their 
hands. All of Las Vegas (and a good part of Clark County) is bursting at the 
seams, locked in a frenzy of growth unlike anything this perpetual boom town 
has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, there's the Mirage, unveiled last month amid a carnival 
atmosphere, and a massive traffic jam, as 100,000 people passed through the 
doors in one day. Halfway down Las Vegas Boulevard -- the Strip -- just north 
of Caesar's Palace, the Mirage sprawls across 86 acres of some of the most 
expensive real estate in the Southwest. The $630-million, 29-story, 3,049-room 
resort complex is the largest hotel-casino in the gambling capital, but it will 
keep that distinction for only seven months. Next June, the Excalibur, a 
$290-million, 4,032-room Disneyland-like castle with 28 stories, will open 
about a mile and a half away, at the southern edge of the Strip. And MGM Grand 
mogul Kirk Kerkorian recently snapped up 115 acres across the street from the 
Excalibur and announced plans for a $700-million movie-land theme park with a 
5,000-room hotel. New resorts and expanding old-timers will combine to increase 
the hotel capacity in Vegas by 17% -- from 64,000 to 75,000 rooms -- by 
mid-1991, with 40,000 more rooms contemplated in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the Strip, in Las Vegas' underdeveloped downtown, Japanese billionaire 
Masao Nangakui, owner of the Dunes Hotel, has announced plans for a 35-story 
office building, the first new office high-rise in a decade. And city planners 
are eyeing a mixed-use development on 300 acres formerly used as railroad 
yards, a project that could more than double the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent city Planning Commission meeting, the agency considered 50 
construction projects; five years ago, the average agenda would have listed 
fewer than 20. West and south of the city limits, residential developments and 
resort communities -- whole towns -- are multiplying at dizzying speed. The 
most ambitious is Summerlin, a master-planned community that will house 20,000 
people within the decade, 200,000 by 2040. 
</P>
<P>
The torrid pace of development is dramatic evidence that Las Vegas is becoming 
a very desirable place to play -- and even a desirable place to live. The land 
of neon and pinkie rings and polyester is being bulldozed by another Las Vegas, 
a thriving resort that is also one of the five fastest-growing metropolitan 
areas in the country. At least one hotel-casino, Circus Circus, boasted of 
turning away 1,000 reservations a day last year, and in the past eight years, 
the population of the greater Las Vegas area has more than doubled, from 
300,000 to more than 700,000. Now, about 800 new residents move to Clark County 
each week. (Less than half of the area's population lives in Las Vegas proper, 
which is hemmed in by suburbs.) What was once Sin City now bills itself as a 
chic corporate playground, a magnet for retirees, a town for families rather 
than a "Family" town. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the action are the runaway success of what is now called the 
gaming industry and the appeal of the Sun Belt. As legalized gambling has 
gained wider social acceptance -- more than half of state governments now 
sponsor some form of lottery -- the image of Las Vegas also has changed, 
allowing the city to market itself to an ever wider spectrum of visitors. And 
for those who might want to stick around, Las Vegas offers a warm climate, a 
relatively low cost of living, plentiful jobs and a gung-ho tax and business 
environment, all at a comfortable distance from rusting manufacturing centers 
and the usual urban blues. In the full-throttle tradition of western boom towns 
founded on oil, coal or copper, Las Vegas is rushing to mine America's last 
great natural resource: good times. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the Strip, the city and the good times are definitely on a roll. But 
how long can it last? For the thousands flocking to Clark County, as well as 
the corporations pouring millions of dollars into the desert, it's too late for 
second-guessing. The bets have been placed. The stakes are huge. And luck has 
nothing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
TOP EXECUTIVES at Circus Circus Enterprises, the company that is building the 
Excalibur, tend to refer to their castle-cum-casino as "our new store." It only 
makes sense. The company already operates four "stores" in Nevada, including 
the original Circus Circus, the first casino to woo the family market by 
offering circus acts and arcades for kids. And the Excalibur -- a Camelot-style 
resort featuring wandering minstrels, a stadium-sized casino staffed with 
dealers in medieval garb, jousting knights, 16 theme restaurants and a 
5,000-space parking lot -- has more in common with a shopping mall than a 
traditional gambling hall. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do is retail entertainment time to people," says Glenn Schaeffer, 
chief financial officer of Circus Circus Enterprises. He may as well be 
speaking for all the new Vegas palaces. "We put together a packaged 
entertainment experience." 
</P>
<P>
It's doubtful that Bugsy Siegel thought of himself as a retailer. Siegel, the 
gangster who built the Flamingo Hotel, is generally regarded as the father of 
modern Las Vegas, the man who shaped a honky-tonk town into a gambling mecca 
fueled by mob money, showmanship and vulgarity. As writer Tom Wolfe noted: "For 
the grand debut of Monte Carlo as a resort in 1879 . . . Sarah Bernhardt read a 
symbolic poem. For the debut of Las Vegas as a resort in 1946, Bugsy Siegel 
hired Abbott and Costello, and there, in a way, you have it all." 
</P>
<P>
Siegel was gunned down in Beverly Hills in 1947. After years of assassinations, 
racketeering investigations and convictions for tax evasion and casino 
skimming, most of Siegel's disciples are gone, too. Thanks to reforms in state 
gaming laws, most of the major casinos in Las Vegas are now operated by large, 
publicly held corporations, including respected names like Hilton, Holiday Inn, 
Bally's, Ramada and Circus Circus. 
</P>
<P>
The new breed of casino boss is more likely to have an MBA than a nickname like 
Bugsy. For example, the man behind the Mirage is Steve Wynn, the 47-year-old 
chairman of Golden Nugget Inc. A Wharton School of Business graduate and close 
friend of junk-bond king Michael Milken, Wynn helped spark the current Las 
Vegas boom a few years ago by sinking $200 million into the renovation of his 
flagship hotel and casino in the downtown area, scrapping its flashy neon 
facade and turning the Golden Nugget into the jewel of Glitter Gulch. 
</P>
<P>
The Nugget's face lift sent a strong signal that Las Vegas was bouncing back 
from the economic slump of the early 1980s, when the city's image was tarnished 
by a recession, competition from Atlantic City and the notorious fire that 
killed 85 people at the MGM Grand (now the Bally Grand). In 1987, Wynn sold his 
Atlantic City casino and borrowed heavily, with the help of Milken's company, 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., to finance the Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn has proclaimed that the Mirage -- a tropical fantasy shimmering in the 
desert heat, complete with palm trees, waterfalls, a massive lagoon, white 
tigers, sharks, dolphins and a 54-foot man-made volcano that spews 
pina-colada-scented smoke every few minutes -- will be "a wonderment the world 
will flock to see." To make sure the world won't be disappointed, he paid $8 
million for the privilege of presenting the Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran 
fight earlier this month and signed illusionists Siegfried &amp; Roy to a 
five-year, $57-million contract. The resort will reportedly cost more than $1 
million a day to operate. 
</P>
<P>
The Mirage will cater to a more upscale customer than the Excalibur, but both 
mega-resorts offer entertainment packages in which gambling is only part of the 
attraction. Gambling is also downplayed in television commercials sponsored by 
the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which tout the city as "the 
American way to play." The ads feature glimpses of celebrities, scenes of 
outdoor recreation, night life -- but not a single shot of a casino. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign was developed by R &amp; R Advertising, a local agency whose 
founder, Sig Rogich, is one of President Bush's media advisers. Federal 
Communications Commission regulations prohibit advertising casino gambling on 
television and radio; but Rob Powers, director of public relations for R &amp; 
R, says the ads wouldn't have been much different without the no-gambling rule. 
</P>
<P>
"For decades, Las Vegas was portrayed as a one-dimensional place," Powers says. 
"Gambling is still our biggest draw, but there was a realization that, hey, 
we're a Southwest city with great weather. The outdoor recreational 
possibilities here are practically unlimited. And if we can get people to take 
advantage of the other amenities we have to offer, they'll stay longer and 
they'll bring the whole family." 
</P>
<P>
Not that anyone wants to neglect gambling. Industry analysts estimate that 
Americans wager $240 billion a year in legal and illegal bets, a 50% increase 
since 1983. Despite competition from other forms of gambling, casinos still 
represent the largest piece of the action, with $162 billion in bets placed on 
tables and in slot machines nationwide in 1988. Last year, Nevada casinos 
reported $4.2 billion in gross gambling revenues, a $340-million increase over 
the previous year. Las Vegas accounts for more than two-thirds of the state's 
gambling action. According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, 
17 million people visited southern Nevada last year: a steady stream of 
vacationers from the Midwest on three- to four-day junkets; conventioneers 
representing video software dealers, Southern Baptists and hundreds of other 
groups; a growing number of foreign tourists, including more than 300,000 
Japanese, and millions of regular customers from Southern California, the 
city's primary market. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing revenues, not everyone in Las Vegas is pleased with the 
changing image of the gambling industry. Bob Stupak, for one 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a problem," says Stupak. "I was brought up to believe that 
gambling was a vice. I think it may be getting a little too wholesome." 
</P>
<P>
Stupak is an independent entrepreneur in an industry increasingly dominated by 
large corporations. He's an outspoken maverick -- the kind of guy who once bet 
$1 million on the Super Bowl (and won) and twice ran for mayor (and lost). 
While Steve Wynn polishes his clean-cut image (he reportedly refuses to be 
photographed next to a craps table or slot machine), Stupak allowed Vegas World 
to be featured prominently in "Crime Story," NBC's short-lived fictional series 
about Vegas' mob-tainted past. While Circus Circus executives talk about 
"merchandising playtime," Stupak still uses the word "gambling," not "gaming," 
in his advertising; games, he says, are for kids. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm against the family-oriented attractions," Stupak says. "I think this 
should be an adult destination. Kids shouldn't be brought up with it." 
</P>
<P>
Stupak may grouse about the broadening of the market, but he's willing to 
exploit it. He recently announced his latest contribution to the construction 
fever: a modest proposal for a 1,012-foot, neon-lighted observation tower to be 
erected in the Vegas World parking lot. The tower would be 28 feet taller than 
the Eiffel Tower and three times the height of any other structure in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal disgusts some of Stupak's foes in city government -- he's wrangled 
with them over building permits in the past. But local pundits defend him, 
pointing out that this is still Las Vegas, after all. If Bugsy Siegel could 
have his fabulous fuchsia-tinted palace and Steve Wynn can have his 
Hawaiian-Island-on-the-Strip, why deny Bob Stupak his towering, winking-neon 
dream? 
</P>
<P>
BEVERLY BURNETT first laid eyes on the Strip almost 20 years ago, when she was 
a teen-ager on vacation with her parents. The memory has stayed with her like a 
scene from a particularly gruesome horror movie. "I thought it was the ugliest 
place I'd ever seen," she recalls. "It's like an adult amusement park, and I 
don't like amusement parks. I was one of those kids who hated the rides." 
</P>
<P>
Burnett still gets "a gut-wrenching, sickening feeling" whenever she drives 
down the Strip. If she had been told, during that first visit, that she would 
one day be raising a family in Las Vegas, she would have laughed. But five 
years ago, the occupational therapist and her husband pulled up stakes in San 
Francisco and headed for the green-felt jungle. They now have two children, 
both Las Vegas natives. 
</P>
<P>
The principal reason for the move was her husband's career; Bruce Burnett, an 
anesthesiologist, had been invited to join a busy practice. But he is quick to 
list other advantages that are drawing Californians, who make up more than 
one-fourth of the new residents, to southern Nevada. "Compared to living on the 
coast, it's much cheaper," he says. "You don't have any inheritance tax. You 
don't have any state income tax. You can replace your home for probably 
one-fifth of what you sold it for in the Bay Area or L.A. or San Diego. You 
don't have the traffic headaches you have in California either." 
</P>
<P>
The Burnetts live in a five-bedroom house on a palm-lined street in a quiet 
neighborhood on the west side of the city, 10 minutes from the Strip. Their 
lives revolve around family and work. They don't gamble, and, like most locals, 
they avoid the traffic on the Strip, which can approach gridlock on a Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not part of our life," Bruce Burnett says of the tourists' Las Vegas. 
"How often do you get down to Fisherman's Wharf if you live in San Francisco?" 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the Burnetts -- with their careful distance from the Strip -- are 
like most newcomers. The gambling boom has meant a massive increase in resort 
employment: The gaming-hotel-recreation field created 5,800 jobs in fiscal 
1987-88. But the same year also saw the addition of another 12,000 jobs not 
directly linked to the resort industry. Tourism is, however, acknowledged as 
the primary building block of the Las Vegas good life. It's the main reason 
personal taxes are low -- the state is heavily subsidized by mining interests 
and casinos; gaming tax revenues alone account for 40% of the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
Even Bruce Burnett's practice is indirectly tied to the excitement of the 
Strip. "Because of the casinos," he says, "the medical community is bigger here 
than it would be otherwise. I took care of one tourist who had a great poker 
hand. He looked at his cards and got a crushing chest pain. We ended up doing 
emergency heart surgery." 
</P>
<P>
Bud and Marilyn Ward are two more life-style refugees from California. The 
Wards, who until last year had lived in Southern California virtually all their 
lives, decided to seek "new horizons" after Bud retired from his executive 
position with a supermarket chain in Los Angeles. The couple spent more than a 
year inspecting communities in Arizona and California before settling on a home 
in Spanish Trail, a high-walled, security-patrolled resort community with 1,000 
homes and three nine-hole golf courses, five miles from the Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"Las Vegas has the best of everything," Bud Ward declares. "Everything" 
includes low housing costs and utility bills, inexpensive restaurants and 
entertainment, quality medical care, friendly service and a host of other 
amenities that have made the city popular with retirees. Of the estimated 
40,000 new residents who moved to Clark County in 1988, 17,000 were 65 or 
older, a 30% jump in the senior-citizen population in just one year. Las Vegas' 
appeal to affluent retirees with time on their hands and money to spend is one 
reason Nevada leads the nation in personal income growth. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically a city kid," Bud Ward says, "and there is always something to do 
here. This is the only town I know of where you can take dancing lessons five 
nights a week for free, and you can dance for free." 
</P>
<P>
The new Las Vegas promises to offer settlers far more than free dancing 
lessons. In the suburbs, residential developers are scrambling to put together 
a more permanent version of the Las Vegas "packaged entertainment experience" 
for newcomers like the Wards and the Burnetts -- and the biggest package of 
them all is Summerlin, a huge multi-use development taking shape on 39 square 
miles on the west side of town. 
</P>
<P>
The project is the brainchild of Howard Hughes Properties. The reclusive 
billionaire picked up the land dirt-cheap in the 1950s but could not decide 
what to do with it. By the early 1980s, it had turned into prime property, and 
executives at Hughes Properties were taking a long, hard look at the factors 
precipitating growth in southern Nevada. They began to sell carefully selected 
parcels around the perimeter of the land to other developers, letting them beat 
a path, so to speak, to Summerlin's door. Now the first phase of 1,000 homes 
within Summerlin, a Sun City retirement community erected by Del Webb Corp., is 
nearing completion. 
</P>
<P>
Summerlin is another startling example of the combination of aggressive 
marketing, corporate savvy and poker-faced brazenness that is fueling the Las 
Vegas boom. The development, named after Hughes' maternal grandmother, will be 
a city within a city, with its own walking trails, schools, golf courses, 
office parks and transportation system. While long-term plans for building 
85,000 homes remain tentative, Hughes Properties has already developed rigorous 
guidelines for signs, lighting and the 16 basic colors of homes that builders 
may choose from. 
</P>
<P>
If this instant-city concept sounds like something lifted from the recent 
history of Southern California, it may be because Hughes executives have 
studied other master-planned communities the same way Mirage executives scouted 
theme parks. "We've identified all the elements we want to have present in 
Summerlin, all the amenities necessary for living and working and recreating," 
says Philip Conway, senior vice president of Hughes Properties. "It will be the 
closest thing in the Las Vegas valley to Irvine and some of the better 
master-planned communities in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
One hurdle the developers hadn't planned on involves the precarious health of 
the Mojave Desert tortoise, the official state reptile. In recent months, 
residential and highway construction in Clark County has been slowed while 
federal officials figure out how to protect the endangered tortoise, whose 
territory is threatened by Summerlin and other projects in the valley. City and 
county officials are confident they can resolve the problem by collecting a fee 
from developers to establish a refuge for the tortoise. Refuge or no, the smart 
money is on the developers. In Las Vegas, given a choice between continued 
growth and sentiment -- even sentiment for a state reptile -- look for growth 
to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
EVERY BOOM CARRIES with it the specter of a bust. What happens in a dream city 
if the dream turns sour? 
</P>
<P>
It's early in the afternoon on a sunny day in October. On the main floor of the 
Golden Nugget, business is good: Throngs of tourists pump quarters into video 
poker machines and sling chips onto felt, purchasing a few moments of 
"entertainment time." Upstairs, in one of the Nugget's plush banquet rooms, the 
fourth annual conference of the Nevada Council on Compulsive Gambling is 
picking up steam. 
</P>
<P>
William Sherman, a slender, sandy-haired man with a mission, braces his arms on 
the lectern and surveys the crowd of about 100 doctors, therapists and 
hangers-on. He leans toward the microphone. "Compulsive gambling," he says, 
"may become the addiction of the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
Several of his listeners nod in unison. Earlier, a panel of psychologists and 
psychiatrists had described compulsive gambling as "an impulse control 
disorder" that can be treated with hospitalization and therapy, much like 
substance abuse. Two members of Gamblers Anonymous, a self-help group patterned 
after Alcoholics Anonymous, offered their confessions. Yet Sherman seems to be 
drawing the most attention -- with good reason. He is the only casino executive 
on the program, and he is as conspicuous as a bootlegger at a temperance 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly gambling is an exciting, socially acceptable activity for a good 
part of the American adult population," says Sherman, associate general counsel 
for Harrah's, a company that operates six major casinos in Nevada. "But with 
increased popularity, there's also an increased awareness of the problems that 
go with it." 
</P>
<P>
No one knows the scope of those problems in Nevada. Studies suggest that 2% to 
4% of adults in the United States may be compulsive gamblers; the figure is 
thought to be twice as high in areas that have legalized casino gambling. In 
other words, Clark County may have as many as 40,000 gambling addicts. Sherman 
estimates that the rate among casino employees may be as high as 10%. 
</P>
<P>
But research and treatment programs in Nevada are still in their infancy. 
Unlike its better-funded counterparts in New York and New Jersey, the Nevada 
Council on Compulsive Gambling consists of a handful of volunteers, assisted by 
modest donations from two or three casinos. Harrah's has recently agreed to 
finance and publicize a toll-free hot line (with ads reading: "Before you put 
it all on the line, put them on the line"), the first such effort in the state. 
Las Vegas is home to 27 chapters of Gamblers Anonymous, but combined attendance 
at the weekly meetings averages only 130 people. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been floundering," concedes Dian Edwards, executive director of the 
Nevada compulsive gambling council. "It's not a problem people want to talk 
about. The recognition and treatment of compulsive gambling are about 20 years 
behind alcoholism." 
</P>
<P>
The problems facing the new Las Vegas extend beyond compulsive gambling. Like 
other resort towns, Las Vegas has more than its share of prostitution (illegal 
in Clark County but thriving) and drunk driving . The city has drug-selling 
gangs, air pollution, traffic congestion and a substantial population of 
homeless, but not to the extent experienced by other urban areas. While 
sociologists are still debating the negative effects of legalized gambling, it 
has certainly contributed to Nevada's high rates of divorce, bankruptcy and 
suicide -- and earned the Silver State the dubious distinction of being cited, 
two years running, as the most "stressful" state to live in by researchers at 
the University of New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
And even the most enthusiastic boosters complain about Las Vegas' unsettling 
lack of community. They point to a downtown that is made up of only a few 
hotels and office buildings, surrounded by motels and adult bookstores, and to 
the sprawl -- strip malls and subdivisions marching unchecked across the 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
To Bud Ward, it's a problem of transience. "The turnover in this town is 
incredible," he says. "If you're young and don't have a lot of self-discipline, 
you're going to leave fast because you're going to discover in six or nine 
months that you're always busted." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Burnett laments the lack of parks and cultural amenities. "Our museums 
are rinky-dink," she says. "They've tried to develop a few playgrounds, but the 
equipment gets so hot in the summer my kids can't use it. I've come to believe 
that, in Las Vegas, even a shopping mall on the corner is an improvement 
because they landscape it." 
</P>
<P>
Landscaping represents one of the biggest problems facing a city caught up in a 
"what, me worry?" approach to growth. You would never know it from the 
greenery, moats, lagoons, waterfalls, golf courses, artificial lakes, 
kidney-shaped swimming pools and water slides around town, but Las Vegas is 
running dry. 
</P>
<P>
Average water use per person is reported to be about 350 gallons per day, 
double that of such other desert communities as Tucson and Mesa, Ariz. Las 
Vegas, with an annual rainfall averaging 4 inches, relies heavily on the 
state's allocation of Colorado River water and dwindling supplies from wells 
and surface aquifers. Officials estimate that, at the current rate of use, Las 
Vegas has enough water to sustain a population of 1 million to 1.2 million; the 
area could top the million mark by the year 2000. Oddly, they say that most 
water waste is caused by homeowners with lush landscaping, not hotel-casinos 
with pools and showy fountains. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad fact that Las Vegas has one of the highest use-per-capita figures 
in the country," says Allison Newlon, president of Aquavision, a coalition of 
southern Nevada environmentalists and business and government leaders who are 
studying the water problem. "We want to make sure water is not the limiting 
factor to our growth." 
</P>
<P>
Newlon is confident that the city can stretch its existing supplies by 
educating the public about conservation practices common in other cities and 
updating sprinkler and irrigation systems to make them more efficient. 
Aquavision members also hope that research will lead to the mining of a vast 
underground reservoir in eastern Nevada that could help ease the water crunch 
-- for now. 
</P>
<P>
Some in Las Vegas are less worried about running out of water than about 
gambling fever's drying up. Newspaper columnists have argued that the country's 
fascination with legalized gambling is nothing more than a fad. When it passes, 
they say, a house of cards like Las Vegas will collapse. Casino owners tend to 
dismiss such talk, but even the most confident still have vivid memories of the 
last economic downturn, in 1980-81, which threw hundreds of people out of work. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Stupak is concerned that the success of Las Vegas could inspire other 
states to legalize casino gambling. He is cheered, however, by the problems in 
Atlantic City, which opened its first casinos 10 years ago and has since been 
mired in economic doldrums and political scandals. "That's a break for the 
industry," he says. "It will keep other locales that are toying with the idea 
from legalizing gambling." 
</P>
<P>
Even if other states stay out of the business, competition within Las Vegas is 
bound to increase. The building boom has already hurt some of the motels in 
town. Wall Street analysts have predicted that the mega-resorts will lure 
business away from older, more marginal properties. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the city's leaders have complained that the local economy was too 
dependent on gaming and tourism; yet efforts to attract other industries to the 
area have been thwarted, largely by the stigma of casino gambling. In the 
1940s, for example, Howard Hughes attempted to persuade Boeing Aircraft to move 
to southern Nevada, but the deal fell through after "both Hughes and Boeing 
apparently became concerned about the prospect of 10,000 aerospace workers 
cashing their paychecks in casinos," writes Eugene P. Moehring in his book, 
"Resort City in the Sunbelt: Las Vegas, 1930-1970," published in October. 
</P>
<P>
As the social stigma of gambling has begun to fade, the Nevada Development 
Authority has lured several light manufacturing and service companies to the 
area, including Ford Aerospace and a Citicorp credit-card-processing center. 
Yet the attempt to woo high-tech companies from California has fallen short of 
expectations, and even the successful efforts at diversification are revealing. 
Reasoning that it wouldn't look right for its cardholders to mail their monthly 
payments to Las Vegas, Citicorp insisted on its own ZIP code and mailing 
address -- The Lakes, Nevada. The company managed to move to Las Vegas and 
divorce itself from the place at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"The stigma is still here, but it's more part of the mystique of Las Vegas 
rather than the reality," says Brian Greenspun, president of the Las Vegas Sun 
newspaper. "The generation of the 1960s and 1970s is looking at Las Vegas as a 
desirable place to live and work." 
</P>
<P>
No one in Las Vegas seems to take predictions of doom and gloom seriously. 
Newlon of Aquavision is relentlessly optimistic: "We still have a lot of room 
to grow here," she says. Glenn Schaeffer of Circus Circus says confidently: 
"The trend in Las Vegas has been one of the stronger operators getting stronger 
and the weaker getting weaker. The strong ones are building right now." 
</P>
<P>
Greenspun, whose father, the late publisher Hank Greenspun, built a media and 
real estate empire in the valley, puts it like this: "The naysayers have been 
saying the same thing for 30 years. According to them, Las Vegas is continually 
overbuilt and headed for a fall. But we've been in a boom for 40 years. Except 
for a couple of years every decade when we had a downturn in the economy, you 
could go back and see steady growth from 1950 forward. 
</P>
<P>
"The important issues are starting to be addressed now, and hopefully they're 
being addressed in time. People are becoming more aware of what brought them 
here in the first place. And they don't want to lose that. We couldn't be a 
no-growth city. Las Vegas isn't made that way. Las Vegans have come from places 
like that. That's why they moved here." 
</P>

OUTTAKES: BASINGER'S MOVES

Watch for actress Kim Basinger to branch into singing . . . appear in European 
commercials . . . and star in a film opposite pop star Prince. Those are some 
new career wrinkles, industry sources tell us, after her recent decision to 
leave agent Rick Nicita at CAA and attorney Barry Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
Basinger's defection set off a scramble among CAA's competitors for her 
business. But for now, insiders report, the $2 million-a-picture actress is 
relying heavily on guidance from Prince, with whom she's been romantically 
linked. (Prince, recall, covered some songs from "Batman," in which Basinger 
co-starred.) 
</P>
<P>
Basinger also is getting career advice from her new attorney, Gary Stiffelman, 
at Ziffren, Brittenham &amp; Branca -- Stiffelman also happens to represent 
Prince. The firm, which handles a range of rock stars, is well-positioned to 
steer Basinger into a recording debut. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Basinger is out of a project at Fox, "Sleeping With the Enemy," that 
was set to begin filming in February. The actress, sources say, was unhappy 
with the latest version of the script for the Joseph Ruben-directed thriller, 
and was concerned about committing to a project without knowing who her male 
co-star would be. Nina J. Easton

LOOKS: BY A WHISKER WINNING THE WAR AGAINST AN UNRULY BEARD REQUIRES THE PROPER 
TOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
JUST AS A beard is the most obvious symbol of the difference between a man and 
a boy, so is a well-groomed beard the clearest distinction between a civilized 
man and a barbarian. And yet, despite thousands of years of practice, even the 
most refined men still have trouble maintaining a smart-looking beard. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the ancients, whose grooming aids were limited to primitive tools such 
as bronze knives and red-hot iron plates, modern man now possesses a host of 
high-tech beard-trimming devices. These resources notwithstanding, 
do-it-yourself trims continue to produce distressingly lopsided results. All 
too often, to save his beard, many a man has had to shave it off. 
</P>
<P>
But beards no longer need be sacrificed on the altar of expediency. Grooming 
aids are relatively inexpensive, and they're easier than ever to use. Experts 
say the only other investment required to keep a beard under control is time. 
"There isn't much to it," says Elton Pamplin, a beard wearer since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Pamplin recommends beginning a beard-maintenance program with a visit to a 
barber. Considering that Pamplin was the 1971 National Barber of the Year and 
manages the Rosston School of Hair Design in Anaheim, this may sound like 
self-serving advice, but a barber can perform the invaluable service of showing 
how a beard is supposed to look after it's trimmed. Next, former salon owner 
Robert Diemer, who founded a skin-care company in Fountain Valley, suggests 
buying a small electric or battery-powered clipper, also called an edger. 
Clippers designed for home use are sold in drugstores for less than $20, while 
professional-quality edgers can be found in beauty-supply shops for as little 
as $50. 
</P>
<P>
Grooming a beard involves two procedures -- shaving around the outline of the 
beard and trimming the beard itself. Before shaving, Pamplin lathers his face 
with soap rather than shaving cream, which obscures the beard. He then shaves 
with a single-edge razor blade held between his fingers. "That way, you can see 
what you're doing," he explains. Although the blade must be handled more 
carefully than a razor, Pamplin says, it's more maneuverable in tight corners 
-- under the lip, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
Trimming the beard is trickier. The traditional shears-over-comb technique 
involves lifting the beard with a comb and cutting it with shears. Besides 
straightening the hair, the comb doubles as a measuring stick that enables you 
to cut to a uniform length. But beware: All but the most experienced 
practitioners find this to be hazardous, and not just aesthetically. "When I 
first started," writer-director Jeffrey Pohn says, "I would actually cut my 
earlobe." 
</P>
<P>
Enter the edger, the bearded man's best friend. By using a guide-comb 
attachment, which elevates the edger from the face, it's possible to trim the 
beard without fear of cutting too deeply. "I wish I'd known about them 10 years 
ago," says actor Greg Michaels, who bought one after repeatedly victimizing 
himself with clumsy scissors work. Depending on the size of the guide comb, you 
can achieve the Don Johnson Look, the Ed Bradley Look or, presumably, the 
Crazed Hermit Look. 
</P>
<P>
And if something goes irretrievably wrong, try Michaels' line: "I just tell my 
friends, 'Hey, I was nervous this morning.' "

OUTTAKES: LOUISIANA A-'BLAZE'

"This is probably the most exciting and glamorous thing that's ever happened to 
our community." 
</P>
<P>
That's how film commission co-chairman George Wyatt summed up the love affair 
between the community of Winnfield, La., (pop. 7,500) and "Blaze" -- just 
released in Los Angeles but still unseen by Winnfieldans. 
</P>
<P>
Winnfield is hometown -- and final resting place -- to Earl K. Long, the 
legendary Louisiana governor who made headlines with his love affair with 
stripper Blaze Starr. It's also where about 60% of the movie was filmed. 
</P>
<P>
What's being touted as "A Winnfield Celebration of 'Blaze' " will take place 
Monday night in neighboring Alexandria (48 miles to the south), site of the 
nearest walk-in theater. (Winnfield only has a drive-in.) 
</P>
<P>
Following the Touchstone Pictures-sponsored screening, at the Alexandria Cinema 
6, Winnfieldans will gather for a bash at the Bentley Hotel -- the campaign 
headquarters where Long suffered his fatal 1959 heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the Bentley to-do will go to further the Winnfield Film 
Commission's pursuit of Hollywood. "Our town can be Anytown, USA," bragged 
Wyatt. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it took some doing to convince the "Blaze" film makers to shoot there. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to wine and dine them," said Wyatt, who brought out writer-director Ron 
Shelton and exec producer Dale Pollock, feeding them Southern cooking at 
Lynda's Country Kitchen and the Huey P. Long Motor Hotel Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to impress them with our rich political history -- and the fact that 
this town has authorities on Earl Long. There are folks here who went coon 
hunting with Earl." 
</P>
<P>
Winnfield won out -- the state film commission estimates that "Blaze" brought 
$13.5 million into the state, Wyatt said. 
</P>
<P>
Also left behind -- in cement: hand and other body imprints of the cast and 
crew. "We have Paul Newman's hand print and bare feet prints -- and Ron 
Shelton's nose and eyebrows," said Wyatt. 
</P>
<P>
"He kissed his (cement) block!" Pat H. Broeske

Meanwhile, New Orleans' Times-Picayune film critic David Baron gives the pic 
three out of a possible four stars, and said that though film maker Shelton 
took liberties with history, he managed to capture "the essence of the Bayou 
state's long legacy of matchlessly flamboyant politics." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Barton, film critic for the weekly New Orleans Gambit, said he's willing 
to overlook the film's "historical inaccuracies" and that he "wasn't troubled 
by the accents" in the movie. Barton thought the performances were "really 
captivating," although "I didn't think the romantic electricity in the film 
provided the sparks it should have." Pat H. Broeske

DANCEWATCHING: A RECIPE FOR 'NUTCRACKER' SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If recipes for sugarplums -- the confection made world famous by "The 
Nutcracker" -- are hardly commonplace nowadays, formulas for the making of a 
ballerina are even more elusive. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the ingredients became more evident as the Joffrey Ballet recently 
prepared the relatively unknown Meg Gurin for her first performance as the 
Sugar Plum Fairy in its production of "The Nutcracker." 
</P>
<P>
Gurin, 22, danced this classical showcase role for the first time in Southern 
California on Saturday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center and faces a 
Los Angeles audience next Thursday at 2 p.m. in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
As she recently paused between rehearsals to talk about her personal route to 
the plum role, she described the pleasure she found in the character's very 
first moments in the action. 
</P>
<P>
At curtain-up in Act II, the Sugar Plum Fairy is poised on pointe, center 
stage, surrounded by a female ensemble of flower maidens. In a moment, she 
begins to glide about grandly, introducing all on hand to "The Kingdom of 
Sweets," and Gurin spoke warmly of "the whole feeling of presenting the world 
to (Clara), showing her and directing her around. I really enjoy that, making 
this whole land come alive." 
</P>
<P>
These remarks complement the recall she has from her early years at the School 
of Performing Arts in Florida when she first worked in a pair of pointe shoes.: 
"Oh, that was the dream! That's when ballet really took off and started to 
become something that I knew I'd do for the rest of my life. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't just, 'Oh, I'm getting the technical thing,' I started to get this 
driving force -- everything was centered toward that!" She looks down as if 12 
years ago were only a minute earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the element of ballerina grandeur, Gurin made a case for unswerving 
concentration. In a rehearsal overseen by two ballet-masters (Gerald Arpino and 
Scott Barnard) and one ballet-mistress (Barbara Forbes), Gurin remained cool 
and calm. 
</P>
<P>
She would be performing her first prominent role in a couple of days and some 
things were not yet smooth or sure. Was Gurin edgy, prone to excuses or 
extraneous explanations? Not in the least. She worked through every detail 
called to her attention, stopping and repeating as often as time allowed and 
her taskmasters suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"You always feel like you'd like a little bit more rehearsal," she said later, 
"but I think that's a really good point to be at, where you've had just enough 
to where you think, 'God, I wish I had just one more rehearsal.' It kind of 
gives you a little bit of (something) for that first performance." 
</P>
<P>
Arpino, the company's artistic director, recalled it was this kind of focus 
that first attracted him to Gurin, when she was a scholarship student in the 
Joffrey School. "Her concentration, her artistry to herself, I always notice 
the individual artist who almost has an aura around herself, no matter where 
(in class) she is, even in the back, you can always tell the young artist who 
is dedicated," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Barnard, now the group's assistant artistic director, recalled the teen-age 
Gurin when she was in his classes for two weeks of a summer program: "She had 
that focus, that natural focus from training, of course, and the dedication. 
Her technical ability was even further along than the normal 14-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
Today, he elaborated: "She's dedicated to the point of being patient -- she'll 
sit for hours doing one step, and a lot of people cannot do that or even fathom 
it, but Meg finds it exciting to spend an hour on one step to perfect it. 
That's top dancing quality." 
</P>
<P>
For this debut, the company will pair Gurin with Pascal Benichou, a newcomer to 
the Joffrey who joined this past July. Gurin had no previous experience dancing 
with Benichou in her already sizeable repertory of lesser roles. 
</P>
<P>
Would she be happier with a veteran Nutcracker Prince? "No, I really like it 
this way. It makes it that much more special, that it's such a special thing 
for him too. So, together we're really creating something brand-new, the two of 
us, that first time. 
</P>
<P>
"To be able to just mold ourselves with each other and to create a relationship 
through the pas de deux, for the audience, for the whole land of the Sugar 
Plum." 
</P>
<P>
Arpino, who hired Benichou (previously with San Francisco Ballet) when he lost 
a group of his seasoned male dancers at the end of last season and who, along 
with Barnard, mutually paired Gurin with the unfamiliar Frenchman, echoed this 
confident view: "I wait to see the relationship. It's like a love affair -- how 
each will then sense the other's rhythms, the other's needs at a particular 
time, and each strength will start to build, and out of that will come another 
sort of relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Added to the grandeur that Gurin likes to display, and the concentration with 
which she approaches her work, Barnard chose her "warmth" and Arpino her 
"lyricism" to further explain why they chose Gurin. 
</P>
<P>
Gurin gave some thought to what she'd like to exemplify for the numerous young 
people in the production itself and the enumerable children who attend the 
performances: 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can show the love of the art form, the consideration for people on 
stage and working together. That image of the snooty ballerina isn't especially 
so with the Joffrey. It just doesn't exist. Everybody is so together and for 
one another, it makes it wonderful to be here. I'd love to show that."

MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN, SURVEY PICKS BRAHMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You are exiled to the proverbial desert island and may take only a few works by 
your favorite composers. Forced to choose, would you pick Brahms? Bach? Mozart? 
</P>
<P>
These three composers -- with Beethoven close behind -- garnered the most top 
picks in an informal survey of musicians conducted by Stephen Shelton of North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"It started out as a parlor game, really," said Shelton, a retired financial 
officer and former bass with the William Hall Chorale. But what began as a lark 
became a three-year project involving the surveying of more than 100 local 
musicians, composers, conductors, vocalists and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"The big surprise is that Tchaikovsky is not first on anyone's list," Shelton 
said. "I asked one person why he didn't name Tchaikovsky at all and he said: 
'He's a lightweight.' But with this person, well, (Alban) Berg was one of his 
favorites and some people would go out of their way to avoid a concert of 
Berg." 
</P>
<P>
For those who want to try this at home, the rules are simple: First pick your 
top 15 or 20 favorite composers -- not those you feel are "important" but those 
whose music most affects you. (A composer may not qualify for the list unless 
several compositions can be named.) 
</P>
<P>
Once the top names are selected, assign a point value to each choice. First 
place is worth 13 points, 12 points are given for second place and so on 
through honorable mentions, worth one point each. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton's results: Out of 104 composers, Bach was chosen most frequently as the 
No. 1 favorite. But when Shelton tabulated the weighted scores, Brahms bumped 
Bach to No. 2, followed by Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, Verdi, Mahler, Debussy, 
Tchaikovsky and Handel. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton admits that the results of the survey are completely subjective -- more 
a musical Rorschach test for individuals than an accurate analysis of the most 
popular composers. 
</P>
<P>
When Pulitzer Prize-winning composer John La Montaine was surveyed, he insisted 
that Bach occupy every one of his Top 10 slots, calling him the "greatest 
adventurer of all composers." 
</P>
<P>
"He wrote in E-sharp minor," La Montaine said. "I mean, who would have thought 
of that?" 
</P>
<P>
But Nick Stremple, music director of Beverly Hills Presbyterian Church, didn't 
list Bach in his Top 10. "I have to be in a very special mood to listen to 
Bach," Stremple said. He ranks Beethoven as the "the most fulfilling composer." 
</P>
<P>
James Low, a Mozart and Bach fan and former regional and district judge for the 
Metropolitan Opera auditions, blames Beethoven for the end of "purity and 
perfection" in classical music, asserting that since his time compositions have 
been increasingly "cluttered up with dead weight." 
</P>
<P>
"Beethoven brought music into the realm of human passion at the expense of the 
high level of spirit where Bach and Mozart dwell," Low said. 
</P>
<P>
To participate in Shelton's composer survey or for more information: 4022 92nd 
Ave. S.E., Mercer Island, Wash. 98040, or call (206) 232-7780. 
</P>
<P>
NOTES: American Ballet Theatre will celebrate its 50th anniversary at the 
Metropolitan Opera Jan. 14, with a gala performance featuring ABT principal 
dancers and guest appearances by stars from the first half century including 
Gelsey Kirkland, Fernando Bujones, Twyla Tharp, Natalia Makarova, Alicia 
Alonso, Agnes de Mille, Eliot Feld and Jerome Robbins. A notable name missing 
from this cast: former artistic director Mikhail Baryshnikov, who had widely 
reported clashes with both Kirkland and Bujones. The program, conceived and 
directed by Tony award-winner Michael Smuin, an ABT principal dancer from 
1966-73, will include rare film footage as well as live performances of 
portions of more than 30 ballets from the repertoire. The U.S. tour of the 
Peking Acrobats has been canceled due to "the current political situation" in 
China. The troupe, scheduled to perform at El Camino College on Jan. 31, has 
been replaced by the Soviet Acrobatic Revue. . . . The San Francisco Symphony 
1990 European Festival tour will include concerts in Dresden, Leipzig and East 
Berlin, making the symphony the first U.S. orchestra to schedule performances 
in East Germany since border restrictions were lifted. Music Director Herbert 
Blomstedt, led the Dresden Staatskapelle for 10 years before his appointment to 
the SFS, announced 10 additional concerts including the East German dates. 
Other newly added appearances include concerts in Frankfurt, Munich, Stuttgart, 
Cologne and London. . . .

ART &amp; AVARICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I applaud Stanley Meisler's "Arts &amp; Avarice" (Nov. 12) for denouncing the 
plundering of ancient treasures. However, I must take exception to his 
characterization of Lord Elgin as "rapacious" because of his removal of 
sculptures from the Parthenon. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the Turks "not care much about the Parthenon," as Meisler wrote, 
they even stored gunpowder in it at one point. The sculptures suffered major 
damage in 1687 when the Turks' Venetian enemies sought to reduce the Turkish 
arsenal by bombarding the Acropolis -- thus setting off the powder magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Drawings of the sculptures from the mid-1700s show how rapidly they 
deteriorated during the 50 years before Lord Elgin removed them for protection. 
The "rapacious Lord Elgin" sold the sculptures to the Crown for only about half 
of what it cost him to bring them to England. If Lord Elgin had not removed the 
sculptures, there might have been nothing left to protect by the time the 
Greeks finally began to show a civilized interest in their national heritage. 
Meisler could have supported his theme perfectly well without ignoring these 
historical facts.

FAMILY LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his article "Family Law" (Nov. 12), Adam Dawson wrote that a wildcat strike 
in Oakland at the turn of the century cost John Byrne his job -- and the long 
unemployment turned him into a wastrel and drinking partner of author Jack 
London. In turn, Byrne's poverty created a fear of unemployment in the next 
generation and a family that headed for dependable public service jobs. 
</P>
<P>
To shed new light on this matter, young Jack London did have the opportunity of 
a lifetime job with the post office of the City of Oakland. Because of his 
natural writing ability, London forsook the public service job in order to 
spend 19 hours per day at his reading, research and the writing of his 
world-famous articles and 50 books.

According to rumors in local restaurant circles, Bice Pomodoro on La Cienega -- 
the casual, trattoria-like precursor of the elegant Bice which just opened in 
Beverly Hills -- was either about to close, or was under new ownership, or, at 
the very least, was shutting down part of its dining room. According to Bice 
director of operations Paul Guzzardo, none of these rumors is true. A new group 
of investors has indeed bought into the Bice chain, and liquor licenses and 
other legal documents are being changed to reflect a new corporate structure -- 
but the original owners of the restaurants are still in place. As for the 
dining room shrinking, Guzzardo says that new blinds have been set up to divide 
off a part of the restaurant that was always meant for private parties. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, changes afoot at Bice Pomodoro. "What we're going to do," 
Guzzardo says, "is develop into a more casual concept, with lower prices, just 
to sort of spread the market out. We want something that can appeal to young 
diners on their own as well as to families. We plan significant changes in the 
menu, Americanizing it somewhat. For instance, we've found that there's a 
tremendous demand in the restaurant for things like Caesar salad and fettuccine 
Alfredo, so we're going to offer these -- though in our own style. We just feel 
that in our geographic area these changes are necessary. And it's also a way of 
further separating the two restaurants, Bice Pomodoro and Bice itself."

CHRISTMAS TWO WAYS: The Beverly Hills Hotel hosts its 43rd annual Christmas 
Carol Luncheon on Sunday, Dec. 24, beginning at 11:30 a.m. The event, which 
includes a four-course meal, carolers and a Christmas choir, an appearance by 
Santa Claus and his elves (who will distribute gifts to children), and a 
so-called "parade of chef," costs $42 per person for adults, $33 for children 
12 years old or younger. For reservations, call the hotel's Christmas Carol 
Hot-Line (213) 281-2967. . . . On Christmas Day itself, on the other hand, 
Orleans in West L.A. will serve sit-down lunch and dinner to about 300 of 
L.A.'s homeless -- most of them children -- sent to the restaurant by the 
city's Parks and Recreation Department. There'll be carolers there too, along 
with Santa Claus distributing gifts. 
</P>
<P>
TAKE TWO: The five-course Chanukah dinner being served at Akbar Cuisine of 
India in Encino on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of this month is $29.95 per couple, 
not per person as reported last week in this space. And one glass of kosher 
wine per person is included. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE FRONT BURNER: The Bistro in Beverly Hills, which closed for lunch last 
year due to a drop in business (according to proprietor Kurt Niklas at the 
time) by the short-lived Beverly Hills restaurant smoking ban, has reopened at 
midday, featuring "traditional, hearty, down-to-earth bistro food." . . . The 
Beverly Hilton Hotel has just dedicated a new kitchen which will be used 
exclusively for the preparation of kosher food. Hotel catering manager Linda 
Kent notes that the Beverly Hilton is striving to become the place of choice 
for all Jewish events in Los Angeles" -- which ought to keep them mighty busy. 
. . . The Wilshire Garden has debuted in the mid-Wilshire area, under the 
ownership of Christian Burci and Livio Uleia, who describe themselves as "two 
native Romanians with a taste for Italian cuisine." . . . And The Alley Grill 
is new in Sherman Oaks, opened by Ted and Larry Wasserman, proprietors of the 
Greenhouse in the mid-Wilshire area.

A BIT OF NEW ORLEANS IN A MINI-MALL

Ole's Louisiana Oyster Loaf, 1111 W. Pacific Coast Highway, Harbor City. (213) 
539-7591. Open for lunch Monday through Saturday, for dinner until 9 Friday and 
Saturday. No alcoholic beverages. Parking lot. No credit cards accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmopolitan Harbor City. There's a phrase you rarely hear on the Westside, 
where the very name Harbor City is liable to draw a big blank. 
</P>
<P>
But if Westsiders got down around Torrance and Lomita more, they'd notice a 
store for fans of Brazilian soccer teams and close by, right up Pacific Coast 
Highway from it, they'd find Ole's Oyster Loaf, a little bit of New Orleans in 
a mini-mall. (Rather, a little bit of St. Augustine High, to judge from all the 
displaced St. Aug homeboys who hang out there.) 
</P>
<P>
Lunch is mostly sandwiches, such as the oyster loaf of the name: fried oysters 
on a toasted French roll with pickles. Even better is the shrimp loaf made with 
fresh breaded shrimp. At dinner there's a lot of fried seafood, above all the 
Super Combo, which is snapper, catfish, shrimp and oysters, served with dirty 
rice (hot link sausage and green onion in it), a jambalaya that's a lot like 
red beans and rice and those terrific fried cornmeal balls called hush puppies. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's gumbo, a thin, astringent broth filled with chicken, crab and 
two kinds of link sausage. It's somebody's oddball personal version, because 
there's neither okra nor sassafras leaf in it, but it has the true Louisiana 
aroma. For that matter, the barbecued shrimp are a little unusual, too: 
actually grilled and dipped in barbecue sauce rather than sauteed in butter, 
which is the usual way. 
</P>
<P>
They have pound cake and homemade praline candies for sale, but the essential 
dessert is the brick-like bread pudding, a dense cube practically three inches 
on a side that seems to weigh a full pound, heavy with butter and full of lemon 
and vanilla. Another essential thing is iced tea, which you apparently have to 
be born Southern to do right. 
</P>
<P>
So I ask you: What does a burg have to do around here to get considered 
cosmopolitan? 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended dishes: hush puppies, $1.60; shrimp loaf, $4.95; BBQ shrimp, 
$10.50; bread pudding, $1.50.

HEAVENLY CHORUS;

<P>
SING-ALONGS, WHICH HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR IN RECENT YEARS, HAVE 
TRANSFORMED HANDEL'S ORATORIO INTO 'MESSIAH' FOR THE MASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On the title page of the libretto published for the premiere performance of 
George Frideric Handel's "Messiah" in 1742 are two words in Latin in block 
letters: "MAJORA CANAMUS." 
</P>
<P>
They mean: "Let us sing of greater matters." 
</P>
<P>
That was the lofty aim at Hollywood Presbyterian one recent Friday night as the 
church and its choir presented a sing-along performance of Handel's mighty 
oratorio concerning the birth and death of the namesake of Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
"Messiah" sing-alongs are a golden opportunity for those singers who always 
wanted to participate in a "Majora Canamus" kind of event but whose singing 
voices are perhaps better suited for more mundane works. "All the shower 
singers come out for this," Fred Bock, the director of music at Hollywood 
Presbyterian, said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, "Messiah" sing-alongs have become increasingly popular in recent years. 
The Los Angeles Master Chorale had two sing-along performances at the 
3,000-seat Dorothy Chandler Pavilion last week to accommodate the singers, both 
professional and amateur, who wanted to participate. The performances marked 
the 10th anniversary of the Master Chorale's sing-along. 
</P>
<P>
Today the 140-voice Valley Master Chorale, which was founded in 1975, will host 
its first sing-along "Messiah." John Alexander, chairman of choral activities 
at Cal State Northridge and the conductor of the Pacific Chorale of Orange 
County, will conduct and host the event. Soloists are soprano Robin Parkin, 
mezzo-soprano Debbie Cree, tenor William Smith and bass Ray McLeod. 
</P>
<P>
The performance is scheduled for 3 p.m. at the Burroughs High School Auditorium 
in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of such events does not guarantee success, either musically or 
at the box office. A few days before the performance at Hollywood Presbyterian, 
Bock was concerned with both. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran into a few problems in promoting this concert," said Bock, 50, an 
affable man who has been director of music at the church for nine years. The 
church's weekly newspaper ad did not mention the sing-along, he said. And then 
there was the matter of the church marquee, which is situated near the Gower 
Street on-ramp to the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a nice corner spot and so, of course, I wanted this concert to be 
prominently mentioned up there," he said, seated in the Tarzana office of his 
music publishing company that primarily handles church music. On a file cabinet 
nearby were two of Bock's favorite albums of eccentric performances of 
Christian music. One is by Tammy Faye Bakker and the other by Jimmy Durante. 
Bock can do a dead-on imitation of Durante singing, "His Eye Is on the 
Sparrow." 
</P>
<P>
"I called over to the church to make sure the marquee had been taken care of 
and the woman who answered said there had been a problem," he said. "I was all 
ready to get upset and start laying down the law, but she explained that it 
wasn't that anyone had forgotten to put us up there. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with 'Messiah Sing-Along,' she said, was that there were too many 
'S's." 
</P>
<P>
Bock laughed heartily. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally it wouldn't have been a problem but the sermon that week at the 
church was 'Possessing Your Possessions,' and they had to get that up there, 
too. Finally they solved the whole thing by cutting some 8s in half." 
</P>
<P>
One problem that could not be solved so easily was the Roger Wagner factor. The 
church pulled off a coup last year by getting Wagner, the popular founder of 
the Los Angeles Master Chorale and leader of that group until his acrimonious 
retirement in 1985, to do its first "Messiah" sing-along. With Wagner on the 
podium the sing-along in Hollywood Presbyterian's 1,700-seat sanctuary was a 
sellout. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger is a great draw," Bock said. "He is a wonderful, serious musician who 
has a lot of show business in him, too. He plays well to the audience." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner had agreed to return to the church this year for the event, but he was 
asked by the Music Center to come home to the Los Angeles Master Chorale this 
year and conduct its "Messiah" sing-along. His sing-along concert contract with 
the Master Chorale stipulated that he do no other Christmas concerts in the Los 
Angeles area this season. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner took the Master Chorale offer and Bock bears him no grudge. "They can 
offer him a lot more money than we can," Bock said, "but more importantly than 
that, we all felt it was important that Roger was being asked to return to the 
Music Center. It was the right thing for him to do." 
</P>
<P>
The importance of Wagner as a draw was immediately apparent last Saturday at 
Hollywood Presbyterian. Only about half the seats were filled when Bock, his 
68-member Cathedral Choir and a 27-piece hired orchestra took their places in 
the front of the sanctuary. Bock faced the situation with the audience head on. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not Roger Wagner," were his opening words to the crowd, and the line got a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Other than a few other jovial comments, Bock took a straight-forward approach 
to the event. There was no pleading or pep talk to urge the audience to 
participate. And he did not take a "Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra" 
approach to explain in detail how the sing-along aspects of the evening worked. 
</P>
<P>
He simply warmed up the audience with "Angels We Have Heard on High," explained 
that they could join in on the six choruses that were in the section of 
"Messiah" being performed that evening and then he turned to the orchestra to 
conduct the overture. 
</P>
<P>
Some first-timers were a bit confused. "I'm not sure what we are supposed to 
do," said Edith C. Lee, 86, with a giggle. But she said she was happy just to 
be in the sanctuary she had seen so many times on television (a weekly program, 
"Let God Love You," is broadcast from the church). 
</P>
<P>
Another first-timer was also confused, but excited about participating. "I 
invested in the book," said June Ashikawa, holding aloft the 252-page score to 
the "Messiah" that was on sale in the lobby for $7. "I think that after 
tonight, maybe this will become a tradition for me. The music is so beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends would not come. They said I was crazy to go out in all that 
traffic. But I would not have missed it." 
</P>
<P>
Ashikawa, who lives in Pasadena, had an additional incentive. Her daughter was 
a violinist in the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Dale, 30, a first-timer who sat with friends in the front of the 
auditorium, had a more pragmatic reason. "I've been looking for something to do 
to get me into the holidays," he said. "The weather has been so hot with the 
Santa Anas blowing that it's not so easy out here." 
</P>
<P>
When the performance got to the first chorus, "And the glory of the Lord shall 
be revealed . . .," Bock turned around to the audience to conduct them as well 
as the choir and orchestra. Although the choir and orchestra were amplified, 
filling the church with electronically boosted sound, it was apparent that not 
much of the sound was provided by the audience. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the chorus Bock gave the audience a reassuring smile and an 
"A-OK" sign, but a couple choruses later he took steps to correct the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Before starting in on "For unto us a child is born . . .," Bock told stories 
about other conductors he had seen do this passage and how he felt it should be 
sung. He had the audience stand to do it. 
</P>
<P>
The participatory spirit began to build with many more audience members joining 
in the singing. By the time he got to "His yoke is easy . . .," the last chorus 
in the Christmas portion of "Messiah," at least half of the audience was 
singing away, even though it is one of the more difficult choruses in the 
oratorio. 
</P>
<P>
After that Bock turned around again to conduct the "Hallelujah!" chorus, the 
most popular and recognizable portion of Handel's "Messiah." It belongs in the 
portion of the work usually sung for Easter, but he knew that people expect it 
to be part of the Christmas proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the big crowd pleaser," he had explained in his office a few days 
earlier. "Sometimes people ask if they can sing it twice." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the performance, there was a lot of good natured talk in the 
crowd about who sang and who didn't. The phrase "Now, it's Christmas," could be 
heard several times. 
</P>
<P>
Dale was laughing as he left the church. "Great fun," he said with gusto. "Of 
course, we spent much of the time making jokes and gossiping about the choir 
members." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Cordone, who had been sitting near the front and could be seen singing 
out right from the first chorus, said modestly, "Oh, I tried my best." His 
wife, Taryl, smiled at him. "He sounded beautiful," she said with conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Ashikawa, who sang during all the chorus but in a barely audible voice, was as 
excited at the end as she was at the beginning. "I feel bad that my friends 
stayed at home. I will be back next year," she said before seeking out her 
daughter who was looking for her from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the choir room, Bock was beaming as he accepted congratulations from 
well-wishers. He acknowledged that audience members were having trouble joining 
at first, and he knew that when they did, it was often at personally selected 
pitches. But no matter. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not what this kind of thing is about," Bock said. "If it's true that 
God looks upon the heart, then he's probably not going to judge us on our 
musical style or whether or not we were in tune, tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity for everyone to join in the spirit of the season. If 
you're not in tune with the music, at least your heart will be in tune." 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Master Chorale's sing-along Messiah is at 3 p.m. today at the 
Burroughs High School Auditorium, 1920 Clark Ave., Burbank. Tickets are $10 
with discounts for season ticket-holders and seniors. For information, call 
(818) 789-1335.

HILARIOUS HILARIONS; 
</P>
<P>
THE GLADIATORS OF COMEDY CONQUER HOLLYWOOD AUDIENCES WITH 80 MINUTES OF MUSIC 
AND MIRTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The Hilarions are on the loose . . . and everybody's funny bone is in danger. 
</P>
<P>
At Hollywood's Theatre/Theater every Saturday, "The Hilarions: Gladiators of 
Comedy" come out swinging for 80 minutes of music and mirth -- with the 
Self-Righteous Brothers in "The Love Theme from 'Pet Sematary,' " a Jewish Mr. 
and Mrs. Santa Claus (The Kringlemanns), "The Safe Dating Game" (everyone's 
tested; they're not very attractive, but they're clean), Marilyn Quayle's 
"National Nightmare" (Dan's the Prez) and a couple running a combo 
mortuary-miniature golf course. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-person show is the brainchild of Michael Caldwell and Rachel Winfree, 
professional and romantic partners who literally "met on stage" five years ago 
in an improv group in their native Austin, Tex. "Suddenly, there was Michael -- 
and he just took the stage," the red-haired Winfree said, nostalgically. "I 
knew I'd finally found someone who went for it, the way I like to go for 
things: full tilt. Just feel it, don't hold back. Don't play safe, don't be 
careful." 
</P>
<P>
In short time, the two were working and living together. "For two years before 
we met, I'd been looking for a partner," Winfree said. "I love to co-create and 
brainstorm -- and here was this person who was just as enthusiastic as I was. 
So many people just want to do it on their own. But to me, there's a great joy 
in sharing the creative experience. Also, when you have a disappointment, 
there's somebody to pick you up -- and then you move on together." 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, though, disappointments were rare. "At home, we were big fish 
in a little pond," said Caldwell, who gallantly gives the couple's age as 32. 
(Actually, it's a median figure: she's 37, he's 26). "We had a show on the No. 
1 and 2 radio stations. We were TV correspondents for the PBS station. Our 
improv troupe was running three nights a week, our vaudeville show running 
twice a week. And for a while, Rachel and I also produced our own show -- 'The 
Bert and Marge Show' -- another night of the week." 
</P>
<P>
Feeling they'd done everything they could in Austin, the pair hit the road in 
Caldwell's 1964 Mercedes and spent a year touring comedy clubs around the 
country -- a spirit echoed in their Bert and Marge tourists-by-Winnebago 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true," Winfree said with a grin. "I like to 'go-go and do-do.' The real 
desire to do it was that I hadn't seen the country before." Some of it, they 
found, was better left unseen. "We played all these horrible little places," 
Caldwell said, wincing. "My favorite was in Kansas, right between two 
meatpacking plants. When we checked in, they gave us a key -- and a fly 
swatter. The comedy club was in the tornado shelter of the hotel." Later, 
during their show, the club's owner got drunk and heckled them. 
</P>
<P>
Since arriving in Hollywood in 1986, they've had to hustle for attention. 
</P>
<P>
"We started going around, knocking on doors -- and people didn't even answer," 
Caldwell said ruefully. "So we'd do things like showing up at comedy clubs at 2 
in the morning, signing up for a spot -- and going on for one person. Lots of 
auditions and classes. Last year, we hosted once-a-month shows at the Backlot. 
But it's really since the first of November that things started opening up in a 
big way. We played the Cinegrill last week. We've got our own little stand-up 
act. And Rachel's part of Shana and the Madelas," an act featuring a trio of 
Jewish matrons singing Motown. 
</P>
<P>
One of the ironies of "Hilarions' " success was that it was originally 
scheduled to open at Theatre/Theater last May, when Jackson Hughes' "Our Man in 
Nirvana" was to have ended its three-week late-night run; instead, that show 
ran for 31 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so geared up," Winfree said with a sigh. "We had this whole group of 
people, and during the course of the summer, we'd get together once a week and 
rehearse like mad people: 'Well, maybe in two weeks. . . . ' But it kept going 
on and on." 
</P>
<P>
Added Caldwell (a member of the Groundlings Sunday Company), "It got to the 
point where we said, 'We really want to be at Theatre/Theater, but if it isn't 
going to work out -- because Jackson may run for years -- we've got to find 
another space.' So we made all these calls and rounds, but couldn't find a 
place that was quite right." 
</P>
<P>
(Their elation at the news that "Nirvana" would end Oct. 28 -- and they'd start 
up Nov. 4 -- was dimmed by word that Hughes had died of AIDS shortly after his 
closing.) 
</P>
<P>
With "Hilarions' " favorable response, the pair is hoping to induce more 
respectability in the area, to be part of the Hollywood revitalization effort. 
They're also sticklers for fine-tuning the show. "If you expect people to leave 
the safety of their homes and come to Hollywood at 10:30 on a Saturday night, 
you've got to have a lot of laughs," Winfree said. "We also try to make it go 
as fast as possible, 'cause we don't want people to fall asleep." 
</P>
<P>
With these pieces, it'd be pretty hard. 
</P>
<P>
Their own favorites are "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf in the Nude?" (set at 
the Ivar, a former porno house one block from the Doolittle) and "The Phantom 
of the Ahmanson," which, Caldwell said, "is about people absolutely obsessed 
with seeing 'The Phantom of the Opera.' Our Phantom is a scalper, who kills 
season ticket-holders for their tickets -- and gives them to young Christine. 
She goes in and falls in love with the house manager, Raoul, and gets him to 
buy her all of the 'Phantom' keepsakes: 'Phantom' earrings, 'Phantom' 
washer/dryer, 'Phantom' push-up bra. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hilarions: Gladiators of Comedy" plays 10:30 p.m. Saturdays at 
Theatre/Theater, 1713 Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood, through Feb. 10. (213) 
871-0210. $10.

THE MANAGER'S VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In regards to Barbara Marcus' Nov. 26 letter on noisy children at movie 
theaters, having been a manager for a theater chain I would like to say I agree 
there should exist some sort of policy that would prevent small children from 
being allowed to watch certain films. 
</P>
<P>
During my three years as a manager I encountered several parents who insisted 
on disrupting screenings by allowing their children to run down the aisles or 
scream and cry. I would politely ask these parents to control their children's 
actions, only to hear that they paid for their admission and were entitled to 
watch the film as they pleased. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that theaters should not allow very young children and infants to 
attend movies, except for, perhaps, films that are intended for young 
audiences, such as the Disney classics. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joseph Herman stated in his Dec. 10 letter that Marcus " . . . perhaps, as 
a child, spent too many nights at home in a crib with a sitter instead of 
enjoying the company of loving parents." Dr. Herman should be concerned about 
the children who are raised in an unsupervised environment, rather than 
theorizing about Marcus' childhood.

AUTRY EXHIBITION

<TEXT>

In reference to John Vanderlyn's 1804 painting, "The Death of Jane McCrea," 
mentioned in William Wilson's Dec. 3 review of the Gene Autry Museum's "Native 
Americans" exhibition: 
</P>
<P>
Being born and raised very close to the site of Jane McCrea's death, I find it 
appalling to read that "such images carry a subtext of the white man feeling 
sexually threatened by Indian virility. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who knows Revolutionary War history knows that Jane McCrea wasn't raped 
or sexually abused. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that Jane McCrea's death aroused American fury and fear and 
solidified those emotions. In time to come, an American army, swollen with 
volunteers, who figured their own families might well meet the McCrea fate 
despite British promises, defeated Gen. Burgoyne and forced his surrender in 
1777.

Herbert Glass (On the Record, Dec. 10) must think "this time of year" is simply 
a religious season. So, if you are tired of "Messiah," try Faure's Requiem. 
Glass probably has not read those buttons some people are wearing that say, 
"Jesus is the reason for the season." A Mass for the dead, no matter how 
beautiful, is a rather bizarre recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
If you've had too much Handel, try Bach -- The Magnificat is magnificent -- and 
there are cantatas relevant to the season galore. 
</P>
<P>
One could try Messiaen's "Quartet for the End of Time" or Berlioz's "L'Enfance 
du Christ," and there is much else relevant to Jesus. But a Dies Irae, relevant 
as it might be for the dark of mid-winter, hardly seems apropos to this season.

ROMANCE IN THE '80S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Rainer can rest assured that there is no conspiracy to portray the world 
in Hollywood's image, romance is, by definition, a bit removed from reality, 
and fills an important need. 
</P>
<P>
Love, a deeper concept Ranier avoided entirely, was depicted in most of the 
films he criticized. Love works, and it's a lot more mature than romance. 
</P>
<P>
Ranier believes optimism recalls a bygone era, but perhaps the author is stuck 
back in the bra-burning, sexual-war era and its immediate aftermath, which are 
both passe.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S many gymnastics schools reflect a variety of philosophies 
about the sport. Some emphasize its fitness benefits; others offer the 
opportunity to participate in team competition. Although few children learn 
gymnastics to become the next Mary Lou Retton, parents may wish to ask the 
director of the center they select to explain the center's approach. 
</P>
<P>
Because children of the same age vary widely in their fitness level, parents 
should look for gyms that evaluate and place kids with children of similar 
experience. Beginners, obviously, should not be placed with veterans. But even 
novices should be given a chance to learn about all the major pieces of 
gymnastics apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
Centers that approach gymnastics as a means of building both fitness and 
self-esteem provide a gentle introduction to the sport. Among centers with this 
approach are the Fun &amp; Fit Gymnastics Centers of Burbank and Canyon 
Country. "In competitive gymnastics, there are always more losers than 
winners," says Jeff Lulla, president of Fun &amp; Fit. "We find ways of 
offering praise even if a task is not perfectly performed." 
</P>
<P>
Centers that encourage their most accomplished students to go into competition 
also offer a full range of recreational classes for children who do not wish to 
compete and do not pressure students to enter competition. Gymnastics Olympica 
in Van Nuys maintains competitive teams for boys and girls. A child-scaled 
training room is available through its Sportskids weight-training program for 
all kinds of young athletes. Other centers offering competitive opportunities 
include SCATS, a nonprofit organization with four centers; Foothill Academy of 
Gymnastics, Pasadena, and USA (United Sports Assn.), Santee. 
</P>
<P>
Gymnastics for children is taught at Fun &amp; Fit Gymnastics Centers in 
Burbank, (818) 845-0700, or in Canyon Country, (805) 255-7244; Imagymnation in 
Simi Valley, (805) 584-8872; Junior Gym in West Los Angeles, (213) 479-2730; 
Gymnastics Olympica in Van Nuys, (818) 785-1537; SCATS of Huntington Beach, 
Anaheim, Mission Viejo and Walnut, (714) 890-7014; Foothill Academy of 
Gymnastics in Pasadena, (818) 446-6789, and USA (United Sports Assn.) in

L.A. STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LASKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WE'VE HEARD MORE than enough about Southwest style and California style. But 
how about L.A. style? No product exemplifies that narrow niche more than Zink, 
a table lamp made by Venice-based Ron Rezek Lighting &amp; Furniture. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-inch-high, 14-inch-diameter lamp has a cone-shaped shade and cylindrical 
base. Its steel parts are dipped into a tub of molten zinc, which turns the 
surface bright and silvery. Then a clear sealant is applied to keep the surface 
from oxidizing to a dull battleship gray within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
The spangled look is what all the fuss is about. The muted metal appearance of 
Zink lamp's galvanized steel helped set a trend in metal finishes away from 
shiny, polished brass and chrome. The lamp's "natural" finishes include 
archeological-looking rusty verde and verdigris, and "retro" finishes emulating 
Art Deco and the early '50s: galvanized zinc and copper hammer tone, with a 
handmade look implying a reaction against the frantic, high-tech pace of our 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Rezek, 43, studied industrial design at UCLA, after which he redesigned the 
typical orange, torpedo-shaped float used by lifeguards to rescue swimmers 
foundering in the surf; his float can be seen on beaches around the world. 
Rezek's 1982 Orbis halogen reading lamp was featured in the High Styles design 
exhibit at New York's Whitney Museum in 1985. The Zink entered production a 
year later. "I was influenced by the Frank Gehry undercurrent here in L.A.," he 
says, referring to that designer's penchant for "cheapskate" architecture using 
inexpensive industrial materials such as corrugated fiberglass, raw metal and 
chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
The Zink lamp's hand-dipped galvanizing process leaves some lamps mottled and 
spotty, others with drips and runs. Rezek terms the aesthetic "contemporary 
rustic." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, such finishes never look quite finished. So, to avoid 
confusion, Rezek says, "I added brass detailing to signal that the lamp is 
complete and intended to look the way it does." 
</P>
<P>
 The Zink table lamp retails for $259 at Blueprint, Los Angeles, (213) 
653-2439, and Lighthouse Lighting, Los Angeles, (213) 658-8863. It also comes 
in versions that hang from the ceiling or from the wall.

MUSHROOM HUNTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANEY MILSTEAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
POD MALLS AREN'T the only things springing up in Southern California at this 
time of year. As the winter rains begin, mushroom season spreads a carpet of 
delicious and sometimes deadly flora over foothills and woodlands, and pickers 
descend to track up the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a treasure hunt. It's even a treasure to find a lethal one and know what 
it is," says veteran mushroom hunter John Clawson, who calls himself a cautious 
collector, even after a lifetime of fungus finding that began when he walked 
the Utah canals with his irrigation-specialist father. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a walk on the wild side, or as close as we can come to it in Southern 
California; mushroom hunting offers the opportunity to get some fresh air and 
exercise and to explore nature. And in the process, it's possible that a fabled 
fungus will be discovered. There are about 1,200 kinds of mushrooms and related 
large fungi in Southern California, 80% of which are edible (though many are 
not tasty). 
</P>
<P>
Since there's always the other 20% to consider, mushrooming can be extremely 
hazardous to the health of the unwary and untutored, making it imperative that 
prospective hunters learn much about their prey before undertaking the chase. 
</P>
<P>
A pleasant and informative way to do so is to participate in field trips 
sponsored by the Los Angeles Mycological Society. The society's free guided 
trips are leisurely walks during which different kinds of mushrooms are 
identified. No experience is required, but shoes and clothing should reflect 
the fact that most good mushroom areas are also hotbeds of poison oak. 
</P>
<P>
The mushroom is a fruit, according to Greg Wright, editor of the LAMS journal, 
The Spore Print. 
</P>
<P>
"When you pick an apple or an orange," he says, "you don't harm the plant 
itself. The same is true of picking mushrooms, unless you remove so much of the 
fruit that it is unable to reproduce itself, or you damage the necessary 
connection between mushroom and tree. To avoid this, we teach pickers how to 
gather mushrooms without removing leaves or disturbing the soil." 
</P>
<P>
January, February and March are Southern California's best mushrooming months, 
and the date for the first LAMS field trip of 1990 is set for mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
More information can be obtained from the mushroom society's information line, 
(213) 292-1900, which will also provide news about mushroom fairs; the first of 
these will take place in Orange County on a yet-to-be-scheduled date in March. 
Spore Print editor Greg Wright also welcomes interested individuals to call him 
at (714) 593-3791.

VICTORIAN DOORKNOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORETTA K. PARAGUASSU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WHETHER MADE OF cut crystal, pressed glass, porcelain, ceramic, bronze or 
elaborately engraved brass, old doorknobs have a Victorian charm that is making 
a scavenger out of almost everyone with a yen to remodel an old home. 
</P>
<P>
Dates on most of the old doorknobs available today from auction houses and 
retail stores specializing in vintage furnishings range from the late 1800s to 
the early 1900s. And there seems to be a stampede to find them. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Abell, at the A. N. Abell Auction Co. in Los Angeles, says a box of 
hardware recently "went for a small fortune." 
</P>
<P>
A pair of doors that were unrestorable came in, he added. They sold for $40 
just for their hardware. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cleveland Wrecking Co. in Vernon, customers who purchase an old door are 
as likely as not to arrive with a screwdriver so that they can take their 
hardware with them and leave the old door behind. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for doorknobs there have ranged from $5 for decorative brass hotel 
doorknobs to $200 for elaborate, entry-door hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Round or faceted, milk glass is at pretty much the same level, along with 
jet-black ceramic knobs. These were common hardware in the 1920s. At wrecking 
yards, door handles often can be found with a transparent glass handle on one 
side and a milk-glass handle on the other, with a mirror affixed to the inside 
of a bathroom door. 
</P>
<P>
Fancy brass or bronze knobs with intricate flower and leaf patterns is slightly 
more expensive. Moving up, a faceted turquoise-blue opaque-glass knob will 
fetch $65. 
</P>
<P>
Hand-painted porcelain, which may have French origins, will vary in price 
according to quality, but it is now among the rarer -- and more expensive -- 
finds. The creme de la creme -- which cognoscenti immediately recognize -- is 
the Bennington. This knob has a fairly plain, smooth and shiny, mottled brown 
surface, but its price tag can easily hit the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
To research the doorknob that has caught your fancy, check "The Antique Door 
Knob," by Maudie Eastwood. There are knobs that look like Benningtons but are 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Places that carry doorknobs include Hodgson's Antiques, (818) 799-0229, and 
Mission Antiques, (818 799-1327), in South Pasadena; Flying Unicorn, (213) 
466-9071, and A. N. Abell Auction Co., (213) 734-4151, in Los Angeles; 
Scavengers Paradise, (213) 877-7945, in Studio City, and Cleveland Wrecking 
Co., (213) 269-0633, in Vernon.

STOP MILKEN BASHING, AT LEAST UNTIL A VERDICT OF GUILT OR INNOCENCE HAS BEEN 
DETERMINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I note a recent letter to the editor concerning Michael Milken, which stated 
that his 1987 compensation of $550 million "doesn't sound like he made it the 
old fashioned way." 
</P>
<P>
What is that supposed to mean? Have we gotten to the point where we now presume 
someone is a crook if they're successful? 
</P>
<P>
I do not have access to all of the facts and evidence concerning the Milken 
case. Neither does the letter writer. I don't know whether Milken is guilty. 
Neither does the letter writer. 
</P>
<P>
I do, however, presume his innocence. And I am extremely offended by someone 
who, based solely on what they understand to be Milken's compensation, implies 
that he is rich, so he must be guilty.

BOESKY FURLOUGH PROVES JUSTICE TRULY IS BLIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is with a degree of cynicism that I write this letter. On Nov. 16, a picture 
of poor Ivan Boesky appeared in the business section. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood buffs will immediately notice that his appearance bears some 
resemblance to the late great yachtsman and movie star, Sterling Hayden. Please 
note that clutched in the prison-hardened left hand is a pair of yachting deck 
shoes and jeans. In the right hand appears to be a soft bag, the type sailors 
use for weekend yachting. 
</P>
<P>
Prison has indeed changed Mr. Boesky. Madam justice may be blind, but in 
white-collar crimes, she appears to have a taste for the good life.

TRADE: THE UNITED STATES SHOULD ESTABLISH LINKS WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY IN 
LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE HIGH-DEFINITION TELEVISION AND SEMICONDUCTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. RASHISH, PETER S. RASHISH, an independent writer and consultant in 
Washington, is a member of a panel of experts at the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies examining the economic and security implications of 
Europe 1992 on the United States. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Japanese buy a stake in the venerable Rockefeller Center. At almost the 
same moment, the Berlin Wall, symbol of East-West confrontation, comes crashing 
down. 
</P>
<P>
This historical coincidence aptly reflects the new world of trade and diplomacy 
that will confront the United States in the 1990s: an economically dynamic and 
politically more self-assertive Japan emerging from its postwar American 
tutelage and a Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals where the traditional 
military alliances are unraveling and economic concerns will be paramount. 
</P>
<P>
In this new environment, Washington should move on two policy fronts. The 
United States needs to respond to the Japanese trade and investment challenge, 
and with the instability produced by the dissolving of the Eastern Bloc, 
America must maintain close ties with the European Community -- a nascent 
economic superpower and important pole of political stability. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has an opportunity to pursue both goals -- boosting its 
economic competitiveness and cementing transatlantic ties -- with a single 
initiative. The Bush Administration should make the legal and regulatory 
decisions necessary to establish new institutional links between firms in the 
United States and the European Community to pursue cooperation in leading-edge 
technologies such as high-definition television and semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
A high-tech commercial alliance between the United States and the 12-nation EC 
would redress the economic balance of power that is tilting toward Japan, but 
in a positive way. It would avoid protectionist, retaliatory threats, such as 
the Super 301 clause of the 1988 trade act, and avoid lecturing Japan about its 
social and cultural faults, such as in the ongoing structural impediments 
talks. Moreover, a U.S.-EC united commercial front, by facilitating 
transatlantic joint ventures, will prevent the EC from crowding out the United 
States from the chase for Eastern Europe's commercial prizes. 
</P>
<P>
A partnership between U.S. and European companies will inevitably be seen in 
Tokyo as an attempt to gang up against it and as further proof that American 
economic policy-making is not free of racist, anti-Japanese attitudes. But 
there should be nothing racist in Washington's deciding that, on balance, its 
most important interests lie in Europe. And with American confidence in its 
economic competitiveness strengthened by its European connection, the current 
mood of Japanophobia, which is already straining the U.S.-Japan bilateral 
relationship, should begin to ebb. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the Japanese are pressing the United States at the structural 
impediments talks to take its own actions to improve its long-term industrial 
strength. That is what a U.S.-EC high-tech alliance is meant to do. 
</P>
<P>
Americans and Europeans are already accustomed to working together on 
defense-related high-tech issues through NATO and the Coordinating Committee 
for Multilateral Export Controls, the 17-nation Paris-based group that monitors 
strategic exports to communist countries. There also exists an informal U.S.-EC 
High-Technology Working Group that regularly examines issues of joint concern. 
But most important is the natural fit between U.S. and European industries in 
the two key areas of HDTV and semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
Though Europe is struggling to retain a domestic chip industry, the United 
States is still strong in this sector, despite growing Japanese competition. On 
the other hand, the United States is years behind the Europeans in HDTV 
commercialization. In fact, it is nearly impossible to imagine a U.S. effort in 
HDTV without European help. Zenith is the sole remaining U.S.-owned producer of 
TV sets, while two European companies, Thomson of France and Philips of the 
Netherlands, own four U.S.-based TV manufacturers between them. Philips has 
devoted considerable resources to HDTV research and development -- all of which 
has been performed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Private think tanks like the Economic Policy Institute, government-sponsored 
groups like the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors, as well as 
congressmen on both sides of the aisle, have stressed the importance of a 
domestic HDTV and chip industry. The Sematech consortium already pools U.S. 
companies to research chip-manufacturing techniques, but the United States 
needs an equivalent HDTV consortium, like the Advanced Television Corp. 
proposed by the American Electronics Assn. 
</P>
<P>
On the European side, the EC Commission has sponsored two endeavors, the Joint 
European Submicron Silicon project (JESSI) for semiconductor research, as well 
as a new European Economic Interest Group merging broadcasters, program makers 
and equipment manufacturers to catch up with the Japanese lead on HDTV 
commercialization. 
</P>
<P>
As its first move toward a U.S.-EC commercial partnership, Washington should 
endorse the EC's HDTV standard. The United States has dropped its earlier 
support for the Japanese standard, but the Federal Communications Commission 
has not come up with a replacement. A common standard will rationalize both 
research and commercialization efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Sematech and JESSI, as well future HDTV consortia, should also grant membership 
rights to firms from both sides of the Atlantic. Officials from International 
Business Machines Corp. and the Franco-Italian firm SGS Thomson have already 
sought such reciprocal participation, but without much luck. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, there is a "Fortress America" approach governing high-tech research 
in the United States. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which 
partially funds current chip and HDTV research, requires that only U.S.-owned 
companies be recipients of their grants. This should be dropped. A step in this 
direction is a bill sponsored by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), which, under 
certain conditions, would make government funding available for foreign 
companies participating in U.S. high-tech research efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In the short term there will be strains in U.S.-Japan ties as American and 
European firms set up joint high-tech efforts. Washington will need to explain 
to Tokyo that, of all the possible options for responding to the weakening U.S. 
high-tech industrial base and the domestic political pressures that come with 
it, commercial alliance-building with the Europeans is the least harmful to the 
global trading system. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the temporary damage done to relations with Japan, America's prospects 
in the evolving economic landscape in Europe will take a turn for the better. 
Although American anxiety about the EC's 1992 plan turning into an 
inward-looking Fortress Europe has eased, new fears about a German-led European 
commercial invasion of Eastern Europe are arising. European firms certainly 
have a leg up on U.S. firms in dealing with the East Bloc, given their 
historical and cultural ties. But with the interdependency created by formal 
U.S.-EC high-tech linkages, American business will be able to make up for some 
of its lost time. 
</P>
<P>
With any luck, one day Poles, Hungarians and Czechs will watch their news on 
(partially) American-made high-definition TV sets.

BOESKY FURLOUGH PROVES JUSTICE TRULY IS BLIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I picked up (the Nov. 16) Times and, smirking back at me is a picture of Ivan 
Boesky as he appeared on his most recent furlough from federal prison. It's 
difficult to say whether my dominant emotion at that moment was embarrassment 
or disgust. 
</P>
<P>
What are we doing furloughing Ivan Boesky -- or any other criminal? 
</P>
<P>
This man is in prison, for crying out loud! For felonies. Essentially, he stole 
from people. And our response is, "Hey, Ivan, take a week off. Go home. Visit 
the family. You're cool, guy."

A HAVEN FOR GAY TEENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So many thanks for the insightful and positive article on Dr. Virginia Uribe 
and her Project 10 ("Haven for Gay Teens," Dec. 7). As usual, the balance of 
pro and con made the article worth reading. It is just amazing to me that there 
are people like the Rev. Lou Sheldon who profess to believe in humanity as a 
whole and yet would deny these gay kids their rightful place in school and 
society. How can these right-wingers justify the amount of pain and death they 
so casually hand down to kids who are as worthy as anyone else of a solid 
education? 
</P>
<P>
The attacks by the Republicans in the state Assembly and Senate have been 
neutralized largely because their approach is demonstrably unworkable. Bigotry, 
"cures" and isolation have not worked in making these kids "straight." 
</P>
<P>
This deliberate attempt to maintain a status quo that hurts real people is 
forever being shown up as unacceptable to the majority of the populace.

I only want to dispute Lou Sheldon's remark that the program should be ended 
because it does not give the gay student "any other alternative viewpoint." 
</P>
<P>
I realize this man is no Einstein, but give me a break. When we are constantly 
bombarded by half-naked heterosexual couples selling us everything from 
suppositories to life insurance, I believe there are enough suggestions of 
alternative life styles. With 3,000 teen-agers getting pregnant every day in 
this country, I'd say the life style message is loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
I do agree with Sheldon when he asks, "Why should taxpayer's dollars support 
only one life style?" Right on. I hope to see the man in the forefront of an 
equal taxation law where, married or not, we all get the same breaks. 
</P>
<P>
This society is geared to the heterosexual, and we are not allowed to forget it 
for a minute.

I am glad to see that youth troubled with their sexuality are being given help 
in today's school system. The recent Report of the Secretary's Task Force on 
Youth Suicide clearly pointed out that gay and lesbian youth are two to three 
times more likely to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan and George 
Bush chose to ignore these statistics is appalling. In a memo to William 
Dannemeyer (R-Calif.) on Sept. 7, Sullivan said any attention to the problem 
would run contrary to strengthening the institution of the family. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, anything that keeps children from committing suicide sides with 
family values. For an Administration that wants to uphold the sanctity of life, 
this response was uncaring and sadly ironic.

I strongly agree that there should be some sort of program that accurately 
addresses teen-age sexuality. But it infuriates me that our tax dollars are 
being used to outright promote homosexuality. Virginia Uribe is not only a 
proud lesbian, but a gay rights activist as well. How can a program founded and 
operated by a lesbian activist be fair and unbiased? I am appalled that there 
is even a debate as to whether this program is converting confused individuals 
into proud homosexuals.

EMPLOYEES TAKE A BREAK, HIT THE BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAJ KAMAL JHA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sounds like an Orwellian routine. Every Wednesday at 10 a.m., about 450 
employees acting on their president's order have to stop all regular work. 
</P>
<P>
As a lull descends on their workplace, they are required to take out their 
books, newspapers or magazines. And they have to read for the next half an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Moore, president of Santa Monica College, is no Big Brother. His 
order, directing all non-teaching personnel -- deans, janitors, gardeners, 
clerks, accountants, receptionists -- to take a reading break each week has 
received rave reviews from the employees. A month after the program was 
instituted, they look forward to unplugging their headsets, switching off their 
computers and closing down their counters for 30 minutes of John Stuart Mill or 
Sidney Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a religious thing," Moore said. "A church or a monastery stops each 
day to pray. Much of what we are about is reading. And it is the president's 
job to see that everybody reads." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said it was to his dismay that reading had become a "lost art" that 
prompted him to "steal the great idea" from an open house he had attended at 
Paul Revere Junior High School in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm irritated that people depend on television for their information and The 
Times advertises itself as a paper that can be read quickly," Moore said. "I 
don't think reading is something which is supposed to be quick or convenient." 
</P>
<P>
The program was greeted with some skepticism at first. Gordon Newman, the dean 
of admissions and records, understood some employees' initial resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a lot of work to do. It was an awkward change of pace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But soon, Newman said, they found that "they felt refreshed and could work 
twice as hard." 
</P>
<P>
"I like it a lot. It gives me the chance to read, something I never got the 
time for," said Yolanda Felix, a clerical assistant at the Job Center. 
</P>
<P>
Cecilia McNeely, who works in the public information office, said the short 
break in the middle of the week gives her "a wonderful opportunity to read 
short stories, poems and articles." 
</P>
<P>
Some students are less delighted with the program, contending that it was 
instituted with little advance notice and makes Wednesday mornings a difficult 
time to accomplish things at the college. 
</P>
<P>
Kanil Senarath, one of about 1,000 international students at the college, said 
he was unaware of the program until a recent Wednesday morning when "it was 
very inconvenient getting a cassette from the library." 
</P>
<P>
But the students, by and large, are supportive of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a short period," Senarath said, "and the employees seem to be strictly 
following it. What they may be trying to do is to form a reading habit. And 
that's a great idea." 
</P>
<P>
Employees quickly began talking to each other about the books they were 
reading, which led Moore to propose a corollary program of "witnessing." 
</P>
<P>
Now, faculty members with classes meeting on Wednesdays and Thursdays take five 
minutes for "witnessing to the class about what they themselves are reading -- 
not as related to the class but what they are reading as human beings." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would have been really nice had I known as an elementary school 
child or a college student . . . what my teachers were reading," Moore said. 
"Were they reading murder mysteries? Were they reading Faulkner?" 
</P>
<P>
Moore regards the reading program as part of a broader effort of continually 
rethinking the role of the college. 
</P>
<P>
"Education is failing to help people enjoy the values and the pleasures" of 
life, he said. "We have to significantly and radically do different things to 
education if we've even got a ghost of a chance of doing our job."

PLAN CALLS FOR DRAMATIC SHIFT IN SCHOOL SCHEDULES; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: DISTRICT STAFF'S PROPOSALS TO RELIEVE OVERCROWDING CALL FOR 25 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS ON THE WESTSIDE TO CHANGE TO YEAR-ROUND SCHEDULES OR DOUBLE 
SESSIONS BY JULY. RECEPTION TO THE IDEA HAS BEEN LUKEWARM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Los Angeles school district adopts the districtwide plan to relieve 
overcrowding recommended by its staff last week, it will mean a dramatic shift 
toward year-round schools and double sessions on the Westside starting next 
July. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen Westside elementary schools would be affected starting with the 
1990-91 school year under the plan, which the school board will vote on after 
hearings next month. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a shift to year-round calendars or double sessions is getting a 
lukewarm reception from Westside parents and educators. 
</P>
<P>
The altered schedules will have an extensive ripple effect within and outside 
the school system. Air conditioning will have to be installed in most schools 
that lack it. Summer camp schedules will be disrupted. Families will have to 
adjust their vacation and child-care arrangements. The school district will 
need more staff, especially bilingual teachers and aides. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many parents, teachers and administrators are concluding that there are 
few feasible alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, unveiled Monday, aims to increase school capacity 23% in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District during the next three years. Enrollment this 
year shot up to 610,000, an increase of 15,000 students over last year. Almost 
23,000 students board buses every day to get to school because their 
neighborhood schools are already full. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the surge in enrollment is at the elementary grades, where the district 
"will be out of space . . . before the 1990-91 school year begins," according 
to the district staff report accompanying the proposals. By the fall of 1992, 
an additional 62,000 seats for elementary school students will be needed, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
First targeted for change are 108 elementary schools -- magnet schools, crowded 
traditional-year schools and schools that receive students from overcrowded 
campuses but still have extra classroom space. All of these schools, including 
25 on the Westside, will switch to year-round or start double sessions next 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
At the individual schools, teachers, school employees, parents and community 
members who serve on school councils will decide which methods to adopt to 
increase the schools' capacity. 
</P>
<P>
All of the district's other elementary schools are expected to implement such 
changes in the 1991-92 or 1992-93 school years. 
</P>
<P>
One of the recommendations by the district staff is to have schools on a 
year-round schedule with several tracks. Pupils would be divided into three or 
four groups, each with 90 classroom days followed by 30 vacation days. Because 
one group would always be on vacation, this scheduling method increases a 
school's capacity by 33% to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
This year-round, multitrack system may be the most effective relief, but it 
creates scheduling problems for families. A family with more than one child 
might find its children on different schedules, making vacations and child care 
difficult to arrange. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you do with younger children if they're (on vacation) in February or 
March?" said Barbara Topkis, president of the Los Angeles PTA district that 
includes the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to go year-round . . . all the (YMCAs), all the camps, should 
be geared for year-round, because most of us (parents) work," added Linda 
Rosen, whose fourth-grade son attends Castle Heights School, one of the schools 
that may have to make changes by July. 
</P>
<P>
Another option is for schools to add portable classrooms, use libraries, 
auditoriums or other space, or have teachers share rooms. A school might also 
increase class sizes, a solution that parents generally reject. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents welcome a year-round schedule. "Children are off too long in the 
summer. They get bored -- at least my children do," said Diane Brahams, a 
legislative coordinator for the regional PTA and a mother of two school-age 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
The least-liked proposal appears to be double sessions. Students at a school 
would be divided into two groups, one which would attend class in the morning, 
the other in the afternoon. The school year would be expanded from 180 to 220 
days. "You're having the kids outside (for half a day) and doing nothing," said 
Jose Hernandez, who leads the bilingual advisory committee and the shared 
decision-making council at Selma Avenue School in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult on children," said PTA leader Topkis, adding that children 
tend to be less alert as the afternoon wears on. "Kids get tired." 
</P>
<P>
Westside schools, which already accommodate thousands of students bused from 
elsewhere in the district, including many with limited English skills, will 
need to substantially expand their bilingual staff to take more, parents said. 
</P>
<P>
School board member Mark Slavkin, who represents the Westside, said few parents 
have expressed objections to having more children bused in, but he said there 
is widespread "frustration of not having the resources" to educate them. 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin declined to say which of the scheduling alternatives he favored, saying 
that "if it's going to work, it's got to be decided at the local school site." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the school board narrowly voted to make all of the district's schools 
year-round, starting in July, 1989, to prepare for the impending overcrowding. 
But after public protest, the board dropped the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we had to live the nightmare," said Brahams, who supported the 
year-round proposal two years ago. "And we're living the nightmare. . . . All 
those fears (about overcrowding) have come to life. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we waited long enough," she said. "It's inevitable we go year-round in 
some fashion. The kids can no longer wait, they have to relieve this busing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS AFFECTED BY PROPOSAL 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District staff has recommended a broad 
districtwide shift toward year-round scheduling in the 1990-91 school year to 
alleviate overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
According to a staff proposal now before the school board, these Westside 
elementary schools would either change to year-round schedules or switch to 
double sessions starting next July.

EDUCATION: ADMINISTRATORS AT SANTA MONICA COLLEGE GET A DAY OFF EACH WEEK TO 
'THINK, WRITE, CREATE.' IT'S PART OF A PROGRAM TO CHANGE THE CAMPUS WORKPLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The president of Santa Monica College isn't allowed in his office on Thursdays. 
The dean of educational development isn't permitted in his on Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
Starting last week, 28 of the Westside community college's top administrators 
are putting aside their normal duties one day a week to spend the day at home, 
at the beach or wherever they wish, making what they see as the best use of 
their time. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica College President Richard Moore, who dreamed up the program, calls 
these officially sanctioned days away from the office "TWC days," designed to 
give the administrators time to "think, write, create." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the administrators has been teamed with an administrative "buddy" who 
will handle any emergencies that arise on his or her day out of the office. And 
phoning the administrators at home isn't against the rules. 
</P>
<P>
As Moore, 56, explained, the plan occurred to him several weeks ago when he 
heard a National Public Radio report on a utilities company that encouraged its 
managers to work at home twice a month. "Why don't we do that, and why don't we 
do once a week?" he asked himself. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the plan has ecological merit, albeit on a minor scale. Days spent 
working at home will theoretically mean fewer administrators' cars polluting 
the air before converging on the campus. "I think smog is a really bad idea, 
and traffic is terrible," Moore said. "We have to get more cars off the roads." 
</P>
<P>
But even more attractive, Moore said, is the notion of building contemplative 
time into the college work week. 
</P>
<P>
"So many of us are captive here at work to emergencies that come up and to 
scheduled meetings, that we only have time to be creative on weekends," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Freed of the frequent interruptions of the office, administrators will be able 
to polish off their paper work and other routine obligations "in two or three 
hours at home, and then we can spend time thinking and writing and creating," 
he speculated. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is consciously trying to change the campus workplace, he said, because he 
believes educators should be in the forefront of examining and changing society 
and that they most effectively do so by example. "We are role models. We have 
to be experimenters ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
As educators, Moore said, "we are not a debating society or a preaching 
society. We have to think things out and change our own lives, then change our 
college . . . and, then, other people may decide they want to make changes too. 
It's how we live, not what we are talking about, that's important." 
</P>
<P>
Moore has instituted several innovative practices on campus recently. 
Non-faculty personnel have been asked to read for half an hour during each work 
week. Moore also has asked the board of trustees to devote part of each monthly 
meeting to contemplating major social, even global issues, such as whether 
drugs should be legalized and the implications of the recent events in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said he isn't unduly concerned if some of the campus experiments flop. 
"Some of the things we try have got to fail or we are not trying the right 
experiments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said he has asked campus unions to consider something like TWC days for 
their members. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who has been president of the college since 1974, said he has begun 
working mornings at his home in Santa Monica Canyon, often setting up shop on 
the patio outside his bedroom, formerly a detached garage. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has three projects lined up to fill his Thursdays. He's writing a 
series of articles on education. He plans to work on his photography: "I'm 
going to pick up a camera and go out and sharpen my eye." And, most ambitious, 
"I'm going to try to figure out how to transform America." 
</P>
<P>
No one knows how the plan will work, but administrators are said to be looking 
forward to it, especially those with long commutes. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Silverman, administrative dean of educational development, said he 
thinks it is a great idea. Silverman admitted he had taken the occasional day 
off from the office before it was officially sanctioned this week, and he 
discovered he thought much more clearly on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
One aspect of the plan that appeals to him, Silverman said, is that "it forces 
other people to step into my shoes when I'm gone." 
</P>
<P>
Silverman said he plans to use one of his Wednesdays visiting the League for 
Innovation in the Community College, an educational think tank in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
He said he'll leave his car at home and take the bus.

American Retirement Villas has been granted permission by the City Council to 
divide its 18-acre lot near Cinnamon Creek into eight- and 10-acre parcels, 
making development of the larger lot possible. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Terry Dipple did not vote on the matter Tuesday because he has business 
ties with developer Brian Barbuto, who is buying the 10-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
A given of the plan was that the existing seven-story retirement home at the 
site would continue operating, as it will do now on the eight-acre lot. 
</P>
<P>
Community Development Director Larry Stevens said Barbuto is seeking a General 
Plan amendment to change the lot designation from office/professional to 
residential and hopes to build 41 single-family homes on the 10-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The council had rejected a request to split the property into five- and 13-acre 
parcels in October after neighbors' protests that a five-acre lot was 
inadequate to accommodate the retirement home, a two-story administration 
building, and parking.

HOT PROPERTY: WORTHY SCORES ON A PALISADES HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Lakers star JAMES WORTHY has purchased a home with a tennis court 
in a gated, Pacific Palisades community for $2,675,000. 
</P>
<P>
The house is about 10 years old but has been extensively remodeled. It has five 
bedrooms, 5 1/2 baths, a library, family room, high ceilings and bleached 
hardwood floors in nearly 5,000 square feet of interior space. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoors, it has a large swimming pool with a spa and a championship 
north/south tennis court. The home also has a three-car garage. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran forward closed escrow in time to move there for the holidays from 
his home near L.A. International Airport, west of Fox Hills. Industry sources 
who did not participate in the transaction revealed the details of Worthy's 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Fronen Investment Co. of Beverly Hills had the listing at $2,699,000. 
</P>
<P>
A Holmby Hills mansion that CHRISTOPHER SKASE, head of Qintex Australia Ltd., 
was buying is back on the market, at $10.5 million, after falling out of a 
five-month-long escrow. 
</P>
<P>
Skase's company went into receivership last month after failing to acquire 
MGM/UA film studios. 
</P>
<P>
Known as the Goetz estate, the 17,000-square-foot Georgian-style mansion was 
built in 1934 and was owned for many years by Edie Goetz, daughter of movie 
mogul Louis B. Mayer. She died in 1988, and her two daughters listed it last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Skase opened escrow in June on the 2-acre property, which had been listed at 
$12 million. The transaction was due to close in August, but Skase reportedly 
received an extension. He was paying in the $8-million range, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The property was listed with another realty firm when Skase was the buyer. It 
is listed now with Jon Aaroe and Joan McGoohan of the Jon Douglas Co. 
</P>
<P>
Songwriter DESMOND CHILD bought a house in Santa Monica called Casa Paloma for 
$2.5 million, but it's in his budget: 
</P>
<P>
Child, who makes about $1 million a year, is one of the highest paid 
songwriters in the business, and he has produced or written hit songs for Cher, 
Alice Cooper, Cyndi Lauper and more than a dozen other recording artists. 
</P>
<P>
He was living in West Hollywood but moved to Santa Monica for its "small-town 
feel and better-rated air quality." Two of his best friends, who are also his 
writing collaborators, also live in Santa Monica. Child will continue to work 
primarily from his office in West Hollywood but is creating an office in his 
new home. 
</P>
<P>
The house was built in 1926 and has 14 rooms, including six bedrooms and eight 
baths. Joe Coons of Rodeo Realty represented Child. 
</P>
<P>
BOB HOPE'S daughter, independent producer Linda Hope, is building a house 
across the street from her dad's in Toluca Lake and has listed her existing 
home, across the street on another corner, at $885,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Her father has first right of refusal," said Jack Sammons, who has the listing 
with Fred Sands' Sherman Oaks office. "That means, whatever the offer, Mr. Hope 
could either meet or better it, because he has an interest in what goes on in 
his neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Hope is also negotiating to buy land in Ireland, where she wants to build 
a castle, Sammons said. The Toluca Lake home that is for sale is Spanish style 
with three bedrooms and a family room. 
</P>
<P>
Glasnost came to Hollywood last week when PETER EYLES, chairman of London-based 
Norfolk Capital Hotels, announced that a St. James Club will be built in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Eyles was in town visiting the St. James Club, one of three membership-only 
hotels owned by his company and the only St. James Club in the United States. 
The other two are in London and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in negotiations," he said, "to build a St. James Club and golf club on a 
125-acre site in a joint venture or small consortium with European and Russian 
partners." 
</P>
<P>
The resort would have about 100 bedrooms, four indoor tennis courts, two squash 
courts, a swimming pool and gym, an 18-hole golf course, a business center and 
conference and banquet facilities. Construction is expected to begin next year, 
and the project would cost an estimated $64 million to $96 million. 
</P>
<P>
Norfolk owns and operates 15 hotels in Great Britain besides the St. James's 
Clubs. The local St. James opened in 1988 in the restored, Art-Deco Sunset 
Tower apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The three-story, 150-room Arizona house, which was for sale in 1986 at $14 
million, was sold at auction a week ago Saturday for $3.95 million. 
</P>
<P>
"There were 43 bidders, and the Resolution Trust Corp. (RTC) accepted the 
(winning) bid on the spot, saying it exceeded expectations," said Aleda Nelson 
of Eric Nelson Auctioneering, the auctioneer. She wouldn't identify the buyers 
but indicated that escrow will close in early January. 
</P>
<P>
Known as the McCune Mansion, the 53,000-square-foot house was owned by 
shopping-center developer Gordon Hall before it was taken through foreclosure 
by Southwest Savings and auctioned by the RTC, a new federal agency created to 
operate failed thrifts.

YOUR MORTGAGE; 
</P>
<P>
CHECK IF YOUR ARM PAYMENT'S TOO HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage that seems as if it only moves upward, 
take heart: Rates on most ARMs have finally started falling, and further 
declines appear in store. 
</P>
<P>
But if your rate is dropping slower than honey from a baby bottle, it might be 
because your lender has been miscalculating your interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
Lenders take painstaking care to avoid making errors on your monthly mortgage 
statement. But mistakes happen. A computer glitch, an errant typist or a 
variety of other mishaps could result in billing errors. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing how to verify the accuracy of changes made to your ARM could save you 
hundreds or even thousands of dollars if you discover that you have been 
overcharged. 
</P>
<P>
"Double-checking interest-rate changes isn't easy, but it can be done," said 
Sam Lyons, a senior vice president of the Beverly Hills-based Great Western 
Bank. "You'll need to start by digging up your original loan papers." 
</P>
<P>
First, read your loan documents to determine which index is used to make your 
periodic rate adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of ARMs in the West and in many other parts of the country are 
linked to changes in the 11th District Cost of Funds Index, according to Pete 
Mills, a lending expert with the California Assn. of Realtors. The index is a 
composite figure that reflects lending institutions' own borrowing costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco publishes this index at the end of 
each month, but the figure represents the prior month's rate. So, the most 
recent figure -- which was published Nov. 30 -- is the index rate for the month 
of October. 
</P>
<P>
The second bit of information you must draw from your loan documents is the 
clause that details how the lender will make its periodic rate adjustments. 
Most mortgage contracts state that the lender will use the most recent index 
that's available 30 or 45 days before the change in your rate takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
The final item you need from your loan papers is the lender's margin. The 
margin is basically the lender's retail markup, which covers its expenses and 
provides it with a profit. If the index rate is 8.5 and the margin is 2 1/2 
points, the interest rate on your loan would be 11%. 
</P>
<P>
Although different types of ARMs are adjusted differently, here's a typical 
example of how you can check the accuracy of changes to your mortgage's 
interest rate: 
</P>
<P>
Assume you get a notice that your payment will be adjusted Jan. 10, and that 
the new rate will be 10.893%. You want to make sure the change is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Checking your loan papers, you find that your interest rate is linked to the 
11th District Cost of Funds Index. Changes are based on the available index 
rate 30 days before the adjustment takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
Here is where it gets a bit complicated, says lending expert Mills. Counting 
back 30 days from Jan. 10, you arrive at Dec. 10. Since the cost of funds index 
is published at the end of each month, the most recent figure available on Dec. 
10 was published Nov. 30 -- and it reflects the October rate of 8.643. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to get the most recent rate is to check your local newspaper. The 
Times' publishes the 11th District Cost of Funds Index rate on Page 3 of its 
Saturday Business Section. 
</P>
<P>
Or you can get a recorded message that lists the 11th District rate and another 
popular index -- the National Final Average Contract Interest Rate for 
Previously Occupied Homes -- by telephoning the Federal Home Loan Bank at (415) 
393-1418. 
</P>
<P>
If the letter announcing the pending rate adjustment differs from the October 
rate of 8.643, it's possible that the lender may have made a mistake. But 
before you place an irate phone call to the customer service department, 
remember that you must also take into account the lender's margin. 
</P>
<P>
If the margin is 2 1/4 points and the index is 8.643, then you should be 
charged 10.893%. If you add the index rate and the margin together and come up 
with a figure that's different from your lender's calculation, call your lender 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have one of our representatives look over the account and double-check 
the adjustment," said Great Western's Lyons. "If there's a problem, it won't be 
too hard to fix it." 
</P>
<P>
A lending institution that has mistakenly overcharged a borrower can remedy the 
problem in a variety of ways, Lyons said. It might send you a check for the 
amount you have overpaid, or ask if you would like the money applied directly 
to your loan balance. Or, it may issue a credit that can be applied to your 
next loan payment. 
</P>
<P>
If you really want to scrutinize your lender's calculations, you can also 
determine whether it has been reducing your loan balance by the appropriate 
amount. It's a difficult process that can be performed with the help of a 
high-tech financial calculator or a standard calculator and book of ARM payment 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
For $25 to $50, there are a few firms willing to do such calculations for you. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest firms is Loantech Inc., which -- for a $49 fee -- uses 
computers to make sure the lender has been applying the proper index rate for 
as long as you've had the loan. It also determines the appropriate monthly 
payment and makes sure that the balance at the end of each adjustment period is 
correct. Loantech's toll-free number is (800) 888-6781. 
</P>
<P>
While the 11th District Cost of Funds Index is the most popular index for ARMs, 
it's certainly not the only one.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: HOW TO AVOID OVERPAYING FOR HOME DURING 'BARGAIN' 
HOLIDAY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I recall you said some time ago that the best time to buy a home is 
between Thanksgiving and New Year's, so my husband and I intend to get a good 
deal on a home now, hopefully from an anxious home seller. We have been 
religiously going to weekend open houses almost every week for the past month. 
</P>
<P>
However, two things worry us: The realty agents almost dare us to make an 
offer; they try to get us to them give our financial details and seem to be 
obstacles rather than helping us, and we've seen similar homes in the same 
neighborhoods that are priced as much as $15,000 apart. How can we avoid paying 
too much and get agents working for rather than against us? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You are wise to buy a home during this season when only the most 
motivated home sellers have their houses actively on the market for sale. If 
you wait until spring to buy a home, then you will be competing with the droves 
of home buyers who come out of winter hibernation. 
</P>
<P>
But don't let the realty agents intimidate you. Many agents can be extremely 
helpful. You just encountered a few agents who didn't seem anxious. Remember, 
most real estate agents represent sellers, so you are on your own when buying a 
home. That statement will cause me to get nasty letters from a few adamant 
agents who claim to represent buyers, but I think that concept is usually not 
very effective. 
</P>
<P>
When I inspect a property for possible purchase and the agent asks me about my 
down payment and finances, I politely reply, "I have enough to handle the 
purchase." But I never disclose my financial status to a real estate agent. 
Only a lender making me a mortgage loan is entitled to that confidential 
information. Some agents insist on getting their prospective buyers to reveal 
their finances because it saves their time, but I disagree and do not think 
that is very smart. 
</P>
<P>
As for avoiding paying too much for a home, before you make a purchase offer, 
insist that the realty agent prepare a written "comparative market analysis" 
form for you. This is the same form the seller received when listing the home 
for sale. It reveals recent sales (not asking) prices of similar nearby homes 
and the asking prices of comparable neighborhood homes. Based on this vital 
information, you can make an intelligent purchase offer without paying too much 
for your home. 
</P>
<P>
Adding Apartment Makes Little Sense 
</P>
<P>
A: The lot where our single-family home is located is zoned for up to two 
dwelling units. Several neighbors have added second units to their properties. 
My wife and I have obtained architectural plans for a rental unit. Two builders 
have bid on the modest plans. If we borrow the funds to build the extra 
apartment, I figure we will be lucky to break even on the rental income and 
added mortgage payment. Do you think we should add the extra rental? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. I am constantly amazed at the homeowners who think it will add more 
value than it costs to build two or more apartments on their property. What 
good does it do to spend perhaps $30,000 adding an apartment to your property 
if the increased market value will only be around $30,000? 
</P>
<P>
As many owners have discovered, a single-family house usually has more 
marketability than does a two-, three- or four-unit rental property. Real 
estate agents often try to sell me houses that have multiple zoning by saying, 
"You can add another unit to the property." That may be true, but it doesn't 
make sense to spend $1 building a second unit just to add $1 in market value. 
Of course, if you can spend $20,000 to add $40,000 of value, then it would be 
profitable improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Home Not Selling? Maybe It's Overpriced 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our house has been listed for sale almost 90 days. The listing is about to 
expire. We have had no purchase offers, but the realty agent seems to be doing 
a good job. I think we should renew our listing for 30 days with the same 
agent, but my wife thinks we should switch to a better company as we must get 
our home sold by February. What should we do? 
</P>
<P>
A: The primary reason your house has not had any purchase offers is it is 
probably overpriced. Unless the agent has such a bad reputation that other 
agents refuse to cooperate, the fault is probably with the price rather than 
the agent. 
</P>
<P>
Ask the agent to prepare an updated "comparative market analysis." This form 
shows recent sales prices of similar neighborhood homes and asking prices of 
listed comparable homes (your competition). Only after you have this 
information can you decide if you home is overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
Since you have until February to sell your home, I suspect you overpriced it, 
thinking you can reduce the price in the future. But home buyers and real 
estate agents are not dummies. If your home is overpriced they won't waste 
their time inspecting it. If you sincerely want to sell your home now, my 
suggestion is to renew your listing with your present agent but adjust the 
asking price to a realistic level. 
</P>
<P>
Unhired Agent Wants Sales Commission 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several months ago, I casually told a real estate agent that I might be 
interested in selling a downtown commercial building I own. About a week later, 
I received a phone call from a man who said the agent had told him about my 
property. I showed it to him and he made me a purchase offer which, after some 
haggling, I accepted. The sale has closed. Now the real estate agent claims I 
owe him a $46,000 real estate sales commission. But this agent had nothing to 
do with the sale other than mentioning my building to the buyer. Do you think I 
owe the agent a commission? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. The statute of frauds requires real estate listings and sales commission 
agreements to be written to be legally enforceable. Since you had no listing 
agreement, when an open listing is involved the realty agent must prove he was 
the "procuring cause" by a chain of events that led to the sale. 
</P>
<P>
If the agent sues you for the sales commission, I doubt he could win. However, 
morally I think you might feel better if you paid the agent at least a partial 
sales commission. 
</P>
<P>
How to Cancel a Listing With Agent 
</P>
<P>
Q: We made a bad mistake. A sharp-talking real estate agent conned us into 
signing a six-month listing for the sale of our home. She put our listing into 
the multiple listing service, held a tour for local realty agents, advertised 
one weekend open house and has hardly shown the house since then. No purchase 
offers so far in the two months our home as been listed. 
</P>
<P>
I met a much better real estate broker who owns the largest brokerage in our 
town, and he said our agent has a very bad reputation among local agents and 
they hate to show her listings, so she gets little cooperation from other 
agents. We are very disappointed in our agent. She never calls us to let us 
know how things are going. We would like to switch to a better agent. How can 
we do so? 
</P>
<P>
A: Your letter is a too typical situation where a home seller signs up for a 
long listing and then hardly hears from the agent again. Now you know why I 
recommend 30-, 60- or 90-day listings. 
</P>
<P>
The first step to cancel your listing is to have a talk with your realty agent 
and her broker. If you can't work out a satisfactory arrangement for 100% 
enthusiastic cooperation to get your home sold, request to have the listing 
canceled for lack of diligence by the agent. 
</P>
<P>
Should the agent refuse to cancel, ask to have the listing transferred to the 
realty agent you prefer. By transferring the listing, the original agent will 
get a referral commission when your house sells. If your agent refuses to 
transfer the listing to a better agent, consult a real estate attorney before 
canceling the listing. However, such cancellation might incur a lawsuit for a 
sales commission, so be careful. 
</P>
<P>
Survey Says Garage Is on Neighbor's Lot 
</P>
<P>
Q: We bought our home about 25 years ago. Last year, the house next door was 
sold. The nice young couple who bought it had a survey made. It says my garage 
is located about one foot on their side of the property line. This garage was 
built almost 35 years ago when our house was constructed. The new neighbor is a 
lawyer and he says I will have to move my garage off "his" property because he 
doesn't want me to acquire title by adverse possession. What should I do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Consult a real estate attorney. It sounds like your new neighbor doesn't 
understand real estate law. 
</P>
<P>
To acquire title to another's property by adverse possession you would have to 
occupy the neighbor's entire property openly, notoriously, hostilely and 
exclusively while paying the real estate taxes for the required number of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
If your garage has encroached on your neighbor's property for 35 years, 
presuming his survey is correct, you appear to be entitled to acquire a 
prescriptive easement. To perfect your rights, you would need to bring a quiet 
title lawsuit to acquire a prescriptive easement to that one-foot strip of your 
neighbor's property. 
</P>
<P>
Houses Are the Best Investment Today 
</P>
<P>
Q: My father made several million dollars profit by purchasing apartment 
buildings and holding them for many years. He started out in the mid-1960s. But 
I am not sure apartment buildings are the way to make profits in real estate 
today. What do you recommend? 
</P>
<P>
A: As a former apartment building investor, I understand how your father earned 
his profits in the 1960s and 1970s. However, owning and managing apartments 
today is not as easy and profitable as it once was. I shifted in the mid-1970s 
to investing in single-family rental houses and have been very pleased. 
</P>
<P>
My suggestion is to invest in sound, run-down, well-located single-family 
houses that can be upgraded by making profitable improvements, such as 
painting, cleaning, landscaping and modest repairs. Avoid houses that need 
major but unprofitable repairs, such as a new roof, foundation work, plumbing, 
wiring and structural upgrading. After you upgrade the house, aiming for a $2 
increased-value profit for each $1 spent, you can decide to either hold the 
house for long-term investment (called a "keeper") or sell the house for 
immediate profit (called a "flipper").

HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: WOODWORK NOVICE MIGHT CONSIDER KITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I like the look of period reproduction furniture with elaborate 
detailing. I'm just getting into woodworking and I'd like to try to build some 
of these interesting pieces. My problem is that my woodworking skills aren't 
what you'd call "polished" at this point. Do you have any project suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Kit furniture is one way to get the satisfaction of making the pieces 
you want when you have limited woodworking skills. You'll also save 
considerably over the cost of the same item that's assembled and finished. 
</P>
<P>
A large variety of period kit pieces available from various manufacturers 
include roll-top oak desks, Queen Anne highboys and even four-poster canopy 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
Most kit furniture is easy to assemble as pieces are usually precut and 
sometimes sanded. Some manufacturers claim you can complete a chair in less 
than an hour and make a full chest of drawers (minus the finishing) in five 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Cracks in Marble Sink Beyond Repair 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our cultured marble sink has developed tiny surface cracks that have 
spiraled out from the strainer and now they are getting longer. What can cause 
this and is there a fix? 
</P>
<P>
A: Surface cracks near the drain can be caused by very hot water or 
over-tightening the drain fitting with a wrench rather than making it 
hand-tight. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the cracks cannot be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
Condensation Forms in Bathroom Duct 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently installed an exhaust fan in my bathroom, which I vented in the 
ridge vent. I must be having a condensation problem because I get a lot of 
water pouring out of the fan duct. How can I correct this? 
</P>
<P>
A: You're right on target. Condensation is occurring in the flexible duct when 
the warm moist air from the bathroom comes in contact with the colder air 
inside the duct. Usually the exhaust fan can move the air out fast enough to 
prevent condensation but this is not happening in your case. 
</P>
<P>
Try reducing the length of the flexible duct. This will result in a higher 
temperature of the discharging air, which may be enough to eliminate 
condensation. If this fails, your problem can be solved by insulating the duct. 
</P>

MOLDINGS TRANSFORM PLAIN DOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL BIANCHINA, Paul Bianchina is a contractor and free-lance writer in 
Bend, Ore. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any wood door with a plain, flat face can quickly and easily be given a whole 
new look through the application of moldings. Almost any lumber yard or 
hardware store carries a large selection of inexpensive stock molding patterns 
that will suit any taste, and you can combine moldings for even more pattern 
possibilities. The look you choose is limited only by your imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Begin by studying some of the designs shown here, suggested by the Wood 
Moulding and Millwork Producers Assn. You might also want to examine actual 
doors, either in magazines and catalogues or by driving around your 
neighborhood, to get an idea of what look you'd like to achieve. You can then 
try a few sketches and experiment with different patterns. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to the lumber yard is next. They'll have a molding chart or a sample 
board that you can look at, which will show you what patterns are available and 
what their actual sizes are. You may wish to use only one design, or you may 
choose to combine two or more of them into other patterns. When actually 
purchasing your moldings, first determine how many feet you'll need, then add 
about 20% for waste at the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
You will find it easiest to work on the door if it is taken off its hinges and 
laid flat on a pair of sawhorses. Simply remove the hinge pins, then have 
someone help you slip the door out of the frame. Exterior doors are very heavy 
and awkward, so be sure you have help. 
</P>
<P>
With a pencil, a straightedge and a framing square, measure and lay out your 
design directly on the door. This will let you further experiment with the 
design and modify it as desired. When you have it exactly as you'd like it, the 
drawn-out design can serve as a pattern for cutting the moldings. 
</P>
<P>
You will need a miter box to accurately and cleanly cut the moldings. If you 
only have a few cuts to make, you may wish to purchase an inexpensive miter box 
that can be used with any type of hand saw. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a lot of moldings to install or if the cuts are at angles other 
than 45 to 90 degrees (the only cuts you can make on the inexpensive boxes), 
you may want to rent a professional-quality hand or electric miter box. 
</P>
<P>
Moldings that meet in a 90-degree corner, used when forming a square or 
rectangle, needed to be mitered at 45 degrees on each piece. To make an 
octagon, where the corners are each 45 degrees, the miters are cut a 22 1/2 
degrees each. Other angles can be made by simply measuring the desired angle 
with a common protractor, then cutting the miters at half that angle. 
</P>
<P>
Attach the moldings to the door with yellow woodworker's glue (lightly sand any 
glossily-painted surfaces first) and small brads. If the moldings are thin or 
if you're nailing near the ends, pre-drill the wood to prevent splitting. 
Finally, set the nail heads, fill the holes with wood putty or exterior 
spackle, and stain or paint the moldings to match the door.

BERGEN, Norway 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were approaching the end of our lengthy rail journey, well past the time 
when sightseer's fatigue begins to kick in. 
</P>
<P>
During the trip, the train windows had framed scenes of soaring mountains, 
valleys, glaciers of blue-white ice, and strings of slender waterfalls 
sparkling like beaded curtains along an immense, verdant mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I caught a glimpse of a new and inspiring sight: a snow-dusted mountain 
so perfectly mirrored in a huge lake that it was impossible to distinguish 
between the lush terrain and its reflection. 
</P>
<P>
These are scenes that can be viewed from the coaches of the Oslo-Bergen railway 
-- a parade of passing pictures that no visitor to Norway should miss. 
</P>
<P>
One of the finer train journeys of Europe, the Oslo-Bergen line is more than a 
run through stunning scenery. It also is an ideal way to sample the best of 
Norway. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1909, the railway was the first overland route to link Norway's 
two principal cities -- Oslo, its compact capital, and Bergen, the west coast 
port. 
</P>
<P>
The line was constructed under difficult conditions. Mountains were blasted at 
elevations as high as 4,300 feet -- well beyond the timber line. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 bridges were built and 300 tunnels opened. The result is a 
306-mile course that, for today's travelers, takes in the Norwegian countryside 
and provides easy access to skiing, hiking and fiord-cruising. 
</P>
<P>
Express trains make the journey in about 6 1/2 hours. Coaches are roomy and 
comfortable, with three or four departures a day, from both Oslo and Bergen, 
with a one-way fare of about $100 U.S. per person first-class, $70 
second-class. 
</P>
<P>
For most visitors the starting point is Oslo. Departing from the main terminal, 
the train at first encounters some relatively uneventful stretches. But at 
Honefoss and Gol the landscape begins to open into long folds of green. Farms 
and forests lie under a brilliant sun as the train moves across the top of a 
wooded valley. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing past Geilo, one of Norway's popular ski towns, the terrain becomes a 
composite of valleys, lakes and mountains punctuated by a waterfall that, 
surprisingly, widens and contracts, forming a glittering diamond as it 
descends. 
</P>
<P>
These areas are sparsely populated, and the isolated wood-plank homes, 
absorbing Norway's radiant sunlight, can seem like details from an Edward 
Hopper painting. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the railroad begins a dramatic ascent past surging stone cliffs. After 
passing through Finse, where there is skiing even in summer, the frozen vistas 
appear almost moon-like: deep seas of snow and ice flow over boulder-strewn 
plains as the train moves across wooden bridges and silent glaciers. 
</P>
<P>
Later the railway descends and browns and greens take over. Continuing west, 
the landscape presents dizzying abysses between groups of mountains and 
hillside hamlets. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour past Voss, a ski resort whose slopes are nicknamed the "Norwegian 
Alps," the train reaches Bergen, that snug, lively city with its handsome 
hillside houses. 
</P>
<P>
As passengers step from the train, a nagging desire surfaces -- a desire to go 
again. Far from wearying the passenger, the Oslo-Bergen railway only whets 
one's appetite for more. 
</P>
<P>
For those interested in seeing more of the Norwegian countryside, the 
Oslo-Bergen railway line offers a spectacular side trip. 
</P>
<P>
Leave the train at the town of Myrdal on alofty plateau ringed by mountains, 
then transfer to another train bound for Flam. The train snakes down a steep 
mountain, dropping more than 2,800 feet in just 12 miles. It's also possible to 
hike down -- through abundant forests and past churning waterfalls. Hiking 
takes several hours, however. 
</P>
<P>
In Flam, catch a ferry for Gudvangen. It's a two-hour trip around a crook in 
the Sognefiord. Finally, catch a bus in Gudvangen for the trip to Voss, 
connecting with the train to Bergen. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the detour will add about seven hours to the trip and costs less than 
$20.

certainly have taken to it. 
</P>
<P>
For some families, the most difficult part of the B&amp;B system has not been 
fixing up their extra rooms or adding amenities, but charging money for what 
they offer. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time we asked people to pay was like a complete revolution," said 
Nancy Fitzgerald of Knockraha in County Cork. Fitzgerald is one of 20 farm 
women who started taking in guests in 1965 as an experiment suggested by the 
Irish Tourist Board. 
</P>
<P>
"Accepting money was not in keeping with our farming family ways," she said, 
"even though we were only asking 15 shillings (about $1.20) per person ." Today 
the average rate is $15 to $20, with a maximum of about $50 for a night in a 
castle setting. 
</P>
<P>
The prices are hard to beat, because a guest gets a clean, furnished and heated 
room and is welcomed to the family hearth like a long-lost friend. 
</P>
<P>
The rate also includes a traditional Irish breakfast that may include hot 
cereal, home-baked breads and scones, farm-fresh eggs, bacon and sausages or 
fresh fish and pots of coffee or tea. 
</P>
<P>
In 25 years, the quality of Irish B&amp;B accommodations has improved 
significantly. More than 400 farmhouses open their doors to guests, and another 
800 homes categorize themselves as "town and country" lodgings. 
</P>
<P>
Rooms are available at dairy, sheep, fish or vegetable farms, as well as in 
modern split-level houses, seaside villas, mountain retreats, thatched-roof 
cottages, country manors and the occasional castle. 
</P>
<P>
Staying in a B&amp;B offers guests opportunities that no hotel can provide, 
such as the chance to share in the life style of the host family. 
</P>
<P>
"People just accept us as we are -- no valet service, bellmen or other hired 
staff," said Fitzgerald, who is chairman of an association of farmhouses. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald's farmhouse, nine miles north of Cork, is a secluded Georgian home 
known as Ashton Grove. It has been in the family for four generations. The 
Fitzgeralds open their doors (and four spare bedrooms) to guests from April 
through October, and concentrate on raising cattle the remaining months. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, horses are the focus at Horetown House, the B&amp;B of Vera and 
Theo Young and their three sons. Built in the 17th Century for a Quaker family 
with 22 children, this 53-room house is set on 223 acres at Foulksmills, about 
half an hour's drive west of Wexford in the southeast corner of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
With more than a dozen horses, the Youngs operate an equestrian center that 
attracts riding enthusiasts from throughout Ireland, as well as the rest of 
Europe, Australia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Youngs, veterans of the B&amp;B business, were among the original core of 
farm families to take in paying customers. Horetown has 12 guest bedrooms (no 
private bathrooms) furnished with hand-carved armoires and chests and beds 
piled high with fluffy pillows and comforters. 
</P>
<P>
Those who prefer a castle can head south from Shannon Airport to Rathkeale, 
County Limerick, and down a wooded path to the Earl of Desmond's 15th-Century 
Castle Matrix. 
</P>
<P>
Now the residence of Sean O'Driscoll (a former New Yorker and Air Force officer 
with Irish roots) and his Irish wife Elizabeth, this restored stone fortress on 
the River Deel has welcomed guests for centuries (Sir Walter Raleigh and Edmund 
Spenser met here), but has been a B&amp;B for only two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors interested in history come to this fairy-tale setting to see the suits 
of armor, antique musical instruments, 400-year-old furniture, tapestries, 
vaulted ceilings, rooftop battlements, winding 83-step staircase and dungeon 
with shackles. In addition, there is a private chapel and a 12,000-volume 
library, with books on Irish heraldry, mythology, art, architecture, medieval 
military technology, chivalry and knighthood. 
</P>
<P>
Although this B&amp;B is at the top end of the price scale, guests receive 
every 20th-Century comfort. Each of the six bedrooms has been modernized to 
include a private bath/shower; three of the rooms are equipped with saunas. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of hours' drive away the dramatic scenery of the Ring of Kerry draws 
overnighters to Muxnaw Lodge at Kenmare, a gabled country house built in 1801 
and named after a nearby mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Along the shore of Kenmare Bay, this idyllic retreat is the home of William and 
Hannah Boland, a doctor and nurse team. 
</P>
<P>
Five bedrooms are available, three of which have private facilities, brass beds 
and views of the bay. A tennis court and three acres of mature garden walks 
surround the house. 
</P>
<P>
Muxnaw is a small home, with a cozy drawing room where guests congregate each 
evening, listening to harp, piano and tin whistle music played by the three 
young Boland daughters -- Faye, Nina and Sally Ann. 
</P>
<P>
At Waterford, famed for its hand-cut crystal, antiques and collectibles are an 
attraction at Blenheim House, set on four wooded acres beside the River Suir 
estuary. Built in 1763, Blenheim is the home of Claire and Greg Fitzmaurice, 
who bought the house nine years ago and filled it with their own Waterford 
crystal, china and objets d'art. 
</P>
<P>
Although its six bedrooms have modern, private bath facilities, Blenheim 
retains its Old World charm and stately ambience. A walk on the grounds is a 
celebration of palms, roses and trees as old as the house. 
</P>
<P>
Because no visit to Ireland is complete without a day or two in Dublin, 
consider Anglesea Townhouse, a 1903 Edwardian-style B&amp;B in the residential 
Ballsbridge section of the city, within walking distance of the U.S. Embassy 
and the Royal Dublin Society Showgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Sean and Helen Kirrane, this house is equipped with modern 
conveniences, from an enclosed sun deck to central heating. Each of the seven 
bedrooms has a private bath, direct-dial telephone and television. 
</P>
<P>
Anglesea is furnished with comfort in mind -- rocking chairs and settees and 
lots of flowering plants. 
</P>
<P>
The lady of the house greets each arriving guest with a cup of tea and homemade 
cake. She also rises every day at 6 a.m. to bake bread and prepare gourmet 
breakfasts of fresh-squeezed juice, eggs, fish, baked fruit and an exotic 
version of warm cereal with whole meal, nuts, raisins and kiwi fruit. All of 
this is served on fine china, crisp Irish linens and the family silver. 
</P>
<P>
Other Irish B&amp;Bs offer a variety of attractions, from organic cuisine to 
private golf courses and fishing lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Whether a house is big or small, antique or contemporary, cottage or castle, 
the B&amp;Bs of Ireland have one thing in common -- a tradition of genuine 
hospitality for visitors. The Irish aptly call it cead mile failte -- 100,000 
welcomes. 
</P>
<P>

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: BERLIN EXPERIENCE WAS A CHIP OFF THE EAST BLOC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The excited passengers dutifully assembled at London's Gatwick Airport for the 
6 a.m. Caledonian Airways charter flight No. 7320. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 day-trippers had each paid 100 (about $160 U.S.) for the round-trip 
tour to Berlin, and they all waited anxiously for the wide-body plane to leave 
the gate. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, as each passenger put his or her carry-on bags through the X-ray 
machines, a security guard laughed and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Hammer . . . chisel . . . hammer . . . hammer . . . chisel," the guard said, 
as he monitored the screen and stopped each bag. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had plenty of these here today," he said as he tucked the implements 
into a red pouch and had passengers fill out the "Declaration of Surrender of 
Prohibited Articles" form. "We're planning to give a prize to the 200th person 
who arrives with a hammer and chisel." 
</P>
<P>
Once checked in, the passengers eagerly awaited their turn to board the 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
But alas, there would be a delay. After 40 minutes an announcement said: 
</P>
<P>
"Due to the inordinate number of hammers and chisels brought on in carry-on 
bags," said a humorless woman on the public-address system, "we will be delayed 
while they are all stowed in the cargo department." 
</P>
<P>
The airplane cabin erupted in embarrassed laughter. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later we left for Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Following the incredible events of Nov. 9, when the 27-mile wall that runs 
through Berlin was opened, the city has become the hottest tourist destination 
in Europe. It seems that everyone wants to visit and cut out their chunk of the 
Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, pilot Tony Meredith descended from 31,000 to 9,500 feet and 
began his run through the Berlin Air Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
He dipped the wings of the L-1011 slowly from side to side so passengers could 
see the cities of West and East Berlin below. 
</P>
<P>
At Berlin-Tegel Airport, the confiscated hammers and chisels failed to 
materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Some passengers boarded prearranged tour buses that would take them into East 
Berlin. I grabbed a taxi with some friends and headed for the Brandenburg Gate. 
</P>
<P>
The streets were jammed with cars all pointed in the same direction. The cab 
driver turned up the volume on his stereo. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone goes to the wall. Ich bin ein Berliner! It is now one big party," he 
said, as he made a sharp turn and the Mercedes cab passed by the Reichstag 
(Hitler's wartime headquarters) and brought us in front of the daunting, 
graffiti-covered walls. 
</P>
<P>
At the Brandenburg Gate, throngs of people were singing, playing musical 
instruments or buying souvenirs from hastily constructed stands. Freiheit 
(freedom) T-shirts ($20), buttons ($2), hats ($10), pins ($4), bumper stickers 
($2) and coffee mugs ($6) were for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Atop the wall surrounding the gate, which remains in East German hands, East 
German guards stood their watch. 
</P>
<P>
The crescendo of singing and music was matched by the sounds of hundreds of 
snapping camera shutters. Nearby, on a specially devised press stand 
overlooking the wall, two TV cameramen maintained their own sentinel on the 
chance that something interesting would happen on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
But about the only thing of interest they could photograph were some of the 
East German guards -- once the abominable "no" men -- standing on the wall, 
tapping their feet to the sounds of the Western music. 
</P>
<P>
We headed along the wall to Potsdamer Platz, where the first section of the 
27-mile wall had been erected. Almost everyone was chipping away and those who 
weren't were trying to catch little bits of shattered concrete as it flew off 
the wall. 
</P>
<P>
The hammer and sickle had been replaced by the hammer and chisel. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more enterprising visitors brought makeshift ladders, larger 
chisels, gloves, goggles and small wheelbarrows to haul away chunks of 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Others rented chisels and hammers -- $3 each for 20 minutes. Some even sold 
larger chunks of the wall -- $1 to $8 each, depending upon size. 
</P>
<P>
Left untouched for the moment was one small piece of the wall upon which was 
painted the most appropriate, if not prophetic message: "One Day, All This Will 
Be Art." 
</P>
<P>
A hundred yards away, Ian Leong, a New Yorker who now lives in Bangkok, was 
chipping away at the wall and placing the concrete nuggets in a plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
"We've managed to get a bag full," he said. "We've only come here for a week. 
It was an opportunity you couldn't miss." 
</P>
<P>
One American tourist took his two children to a graffiti-covered spot in the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Stand back, kids," he said as he brandished his pickaxe-hammer. More of the 
Berlin Wall began to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
Toward Checkpoint Charlie a man sat astride the top using a big rock to smash 
pieces of the rounded, pipe-like cowling. People below stopped to pick up the 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
At last we made it to Checkpoint Charlie, the largest and best known of the 
border crossing points. Hundreds of people stood in line waiting to go to East 
Germany. Another line of small, ugly East German Trabant cars, each belching 
its own obnoxious clouds of fumes, waited to drive into the West. 
</P>
<P>
Soon it was time to head back to the airport and our flight to London. 
</P>
<P>
Once airborne, the passengers pulled out and compared their chunks of the wall. 
Others regaled fellow passengers with their adventures of the previous seven 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It was incredible," said Teresa Soriano, a Georgetown University student on 
holiday. "We went into East Berlin and the guards were friendly. We gave some a 
dollar and they gave us a piece of the wall from their side. Another sold us a 
chunk for a chocolate bar." 
</P>
<P>
One group of British youngsters rented an Audi at the airport and drove it 
across the border and 20 miles into East Germany to have a look. They made it 
back to the flight just before the cabin crew shut the door. 
</P>
<P>
Caledonian co-pilot Peter Brent joked about the weighty return. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope we don't have too much of the Berlin Wall tucked in your bags and 
pockets," he said. "We tried chipping ourselves; it's a lot more solid than it 
looked." 
</P>
<P>
Maggie Parker, an assistant director from "L.A. Law," brought back a huge chunk 
of the wall she bought for $20, as well as a handful of souvenir badges and 
about half a dozen commemorative T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an opportunity I couldn't miss," she said. "The chance to chip away a 
piece of history was just too much. These will undoubtedly be some of the most 
unusual Christmas presents I have ever given." 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Naismith, the London-based director of the International Internship 
Program for James Madison University, was also an enthusiastic visitor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fascinating experience," Naismith said. "It was festive. The East 
Germans were anxious to meet people. A young East German woman came up to us to 
talk. She said that last week in her classes the teachers simply canceled the 
economics and planning courses, saying they were no longer valid." 
</P>
<P>
GTF Tours (184-186 Kensington Church St., Nottinghill Gate, London W8, England) 
is continuing its Berlin Airlift service. It may also begin similar trips to 
Prague. 
</P>
<P>
American Express in London offers weekend trips to Berlin from about $385 U.S. 
for two nights (must include Saturday night) to about $775 for five nights. Pan 
Am also offers a tour to Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
There are also hotel discounts. "Dial Berlin" is an association of local hotel 
operators. It has a U.S. toll-free number: (800) 237-5469.

On the Road: Richard Saul Wurzman has produced a U.S. road atlas that's 
organized by region rather than alphabetically by state. Divides the nation 
into 250-by-250-mile grids. By using Wurzman's "USAtlas" it's unnecessary to 
possess a doctorate in cartography to get a fix on Seattle or San Francisco. Or 
Savannah or Schenectady. Wurzman is the same guidester who created the city 
Access guides. (In his "USAtlas" he reserves the margins for travel trivia.) No 
table of contents. Just a cover map that slices up the nation into numbered 
grids. Pick a number and turn to the page. It's as simple as that.

Have you no shame? Is nothing sacred? Two years ago you wrote an excellent 
article on Strasbourg, the beautiful city in Alsace (April 24, 1988). You spoke 
of La Petite Francaise, the cathedral, the boat ride on the L'ille River. And, 
there is the European Parliament, which is worthy of a visit. 
</P>
<P>
Please, sir, no more. The Route du Vin (by Jerry Hulse, Dec. 3, 1989) will 
become as (crowded as) the Hollywood Freeway and as popular as Disneyland. 
Leave us in peace, please. Wines, cheese, French bread, chocolates and our 
beautiful countryside may be all that is left of civilization. We'll give you 
Gorby, even Paris, if you will but leave Strasbourg and the Route du Vin from 
your columns.

A LITTLE INFORMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent weeks you published an article ("Normandy Memories Still Sharp," by 
Bob O'Sullivan, Nov. 19) about the little French village of Sainte-Mere-Eglise, 
where on day one of the Normandy invasion a U.S. paratrooper landed with his 
parachute caught in the steeple of the church. I would like to add a little 
information. 
</P>
<P>
The little church was built between the 11 and 13th centuries. Repairs made 
after World War II include a large stained-glass window showing the American 
parachute drop, a beautiful combination of an ancient art, an ancient building 
and a relatively current event. Information given to us at the church says the 
paratrooper involved was John Steele and that he died in 1962.

COMPASSION APPRECIATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Friday I got the news of a death in the family, occurring in Des Moines. The 
funeral was to be Monday. I called three airlines: American, United and America 
West. They all serve Des Moines from Los Angeles. Of the three, only American 
offered me a compassionate fare for flying on Sunday and returning on Tuesday. 
This fare was less than half the regular (not weekend) fare. And when I picked 
up my ticket at American, the clerk was very solicitous and expressed real 
concern for me and the trip I was taking. 
</P>
<P>
I can best express my appreciation by informing others of this courtesy.

PLEASANT DISCOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I are fortunate in being able to travel frequently, both in the 
United States and internationally. Recently we had the pleasure of flying on 
Cathay Pacific Airways. I cannot praise Cathay Pacific too highly for the 
outstanding in-flight service and the fine food that we encountered on all of 
our trips. This was particularly noteworthy since we were traveling during a 
heavy traffic period and the cabin was fully occupied. The purpose of this 
letter is to share our discovery with your readers. I wish someone had told me 
about Cathay Pacific long before I discovered it for myself.

EAST BERLIN: FROM GRIM GUARDS TO HAPPY HACKIES

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gus the cab driver was practicing some street-smart capitalism. He scoffed at 
the Southern Californians' offer of $10 to drive five of them around East 
Berlin for two hours last weekend. The burly man with a round, gentle face 
noted that his counterparts on the other side of the wall demand 30 West German 
marks an hour per person. Seeming to argue that the winds of democracy already 
had brought East and West together, he said, "We are worth the same now." 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. More than holes in the Berlin Wall will be required to do that. Gus 
and fellow driver Henry finally settled on their two cabs for two hours at 
roughly $10 a person. That is less than a bus tour. At the same time, Gus and 
Henry would pocket $25 each in hard currency in two hours' time. Not a bad 
day's work, considering that amount will buy nearly a month's apartment rent or 
gasoline in the heavily subsidized East Berlin economy. 
</P>
<P>
These are good times for Gus and his fellows. 
</P>
<P>
To visit Berlin, East Germany and other East Bloc countries has become the 
thing Europeans want to do this winter -- the destinations of choice as a whole 
region emerges from four decades of repression and economic stagnation. Airline 
flights are jammed. Trains are booked far in advance. Hotel rooms are hard to 
get. Pan Am reports that traffic to Eastern Europe has increased by 25% over 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin is the strongest magnet of all. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wants to go to Berlin," Danish travel agent Marianne Lohse told 
members of the California group attending a week-long series of environmental 
conferences in Copenhagen. Now the contingent was exploring a chance to extend 
their travel by one day to squeeze in a quick trip to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The going grew more complicated when an official of the Polish embassy in 
Copenhagen urged the party to visit Warsaw, too. He offered to provide visas 
quickly. The incredibly patient Lohse of the Danish travel agency explored at 
least a dozen combinations of routes and times into Berlin and/or Warsaw. One 
leg of each potential route was already booked to capacity. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Dec. 7, we learned that Lohse had achieved what had seemed 
to be the impossible only a day before: a flight out of Copenhagen Saturday 
morning to Warsaw, Warsaw to West Berlin via Frankfurt Saturday evening, and 
returning Sunday night to Copenhagen by way of Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
For all the change, visiting Eastern Europe for the first time can be daunting. 
Arriving at Warsaw's airport was like stepping into a 1950s black-and-white 
movie. Armed soldiers stood at the foot of the airline ramp. Passport guards 
stared grimly from passport photo to visitor time and again before stamping 
approval. Passengers, including many Polish-Americans coming for the holidays, 
jammed customs lines with bulging suitcases and cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Those were minor anxieties and inconveniences, though. Graced with a five-inch 
blanket of fresh snow, Warsaw was much less bleak than expected. After lunch 
for five at the Victoria Hotel for 92,000 zlotys (about $23), driver Leszek 
Drzazgowski took us through historic sections of the city, including stops at 
the site of the ghetto, the church where Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski's crypt was 
covered with fresh flowers and the Old Town market square. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the wall breached, getting into East Berlin at the Friedrichstrasse 
S-bahn station still has a Cold War atmosphere. When our group tried to return 
to West Berlin at Checkpoint Charlie, we were told we must exit along the same 
route we had entered, a bone-chilling 20-minute walk back to the station. 
There, the guards seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to clear us. 
</P>
<P>
East Berlin is home for most of the great buildings that survived World War II. 
It has taken more than 40 years, but the majority of gutted structures have 
been restored handsomely. The tour included Hitler's unmarked bunker and the 
Brandenburg Gate, Unter den Linden to Alexanderplatz and Marx-Engels Platz, the 
cathedral, the state opera house, Old Town and the museums alongside the River 
Spree. 
</P>
<P>
There was a stop for beer and coffee at a comfortable tavern in Old Town, where 
students at the adjacent table laughed and joked as Henry and Gus debated in 
German how to answer our questions about the changes in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Both in Warsaw and East Berlin, guides remarked that they are no longer 
harassed by police over petty infractions or perceived violations. "I don't 
have to do that any more," Henry said, referring to his unbuckled seat belt. In 
Warsaw, Drzazgowski commented, "You don't have to worry about tickets. The 
police don't have anything to do. And they don't want to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
Back on the west side of the Bradenburg Gate, thousands of tourists bundled 
against the cold wind walked half a mile to the Berlin Wall on Sunday 
afternoon. There was no hammering here, and not much celebration. Many walked 
up and touched the graffiti-covered barrier silently, in awe, much like people 
seeing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington for the first time. They 
were not mourning the fact that it was coming down, of course, but perhaps 
reflecting on what it had meant for so many years, and what the future might 
hold.

GERMANYS: WHILE THE EAST GERMAN REVOLUTION CONTINUES, WITH DEMANDS FOR REVENGE,

EBENHAUSEN, WEST GERMANY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you intend to convert from dictator to democrat, have another look at a 
classic: Alexis de Tocqueville in his "L'Ancien Regime et la Revolution" in 
1856 stated that authoritarian regimes are not in danger when they are at their 
worst but when they begin to lift the iron lid over society and try to reform. 
Egon Krenz, the stopgap East German leader of seven weeks' duration, can add a 
new variation to a familiar theme. 
</P>
<P>
The East German revolution is now in its second phase, with more to come. The 
first one was soft, ironic, good-humored, relentless and characterized by a 
consensus on reform socialism -- the traditional Social Democratic "third 
option" between the hardships of the free marketplace and the rigid 
authoritarianism of central planning. 
</P>
<P>
This second phase, dating from the end of November and still continuing, has 
changed pace and tone. 
</P>
<P>
There are demands for revenge, and some of the collaborators of the 
Staatssicherheitsdienst -- the East German equivalent of the KGB -- are having 
a hard time. The churches and what is left of the old authorities warn against 
attacks on state security buildings, the police and the army. The masses are 
upset about a massive corruption at the top and cover-ups, about feudal 
privileges among the deposed leadership of the Socialist Unity Party (SED, as 
the Communist Party is known) and about numbered Swiss bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The SED, which initially tried to postpone the elections in order to recover 
its footing, has in its current condition nothing to lose. The political 
opposition groups are confident they can build themselves up quickly enough and 
perhaps form pre-election coalitions. For its part, the SED is trying to adopt 
a new personality and coin a new name. Those changes are the theme this weekend 
for the second installment of the party conference begun last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing to observe now in this second phase is a change in the mood 
of the demonstrators in the streets. Good-humored slogans of the first four 
weeks are giving way to more pronounced political demands, above all for German 
unity: "Deutschland einig Vaterland" ("A unified German fatherland") is the 
not-uncontested cry of 20-year-olds in Leipzig, citing the long-suppressed 
official text of the German Democratic Republic's hymn. 
</P>
<P>
What do they mean? As one of their posters stated unequivocally: "Life is too 
short to spend it in the GDR." So the option is to leave the impoverished 
country or make the GDR disappear through German unity. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned editorials in the world press or angry noises from Moscow or 
elsewhere do not much impress people emerging from crisis and peaceful 
revolution. German unity for them is not the glory and the gloom of Prince Otto 
von Bismarck's German Empire, or its aftermath. For them it is the only chance 
of leading a life of their own beyond poverty and inefficiency, and of 
realizing their right to the pursuit of happiness. What drives them is not 
nationalism, but the simple desire to come in from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the Bundestag two weeks ago put forward a 10-point 
plan for "confederative structures," to be realized in stages. This was an 
attempt to give a name and a direction to a dynamic process already under way. 
No Bismarckian empire is envisaged -- that is clearly a thing of the past. Not 
even reunification. For the time being, the relationship between the two 
Germanys is characterized by a paradox. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, there is the new unrestricted freedom to travel. Together with 
the undivided legal nature of German citizenship, including the right of the 
East Germans to full participation in West Germany's welfare state, a dynamic 
force is now setting hundreds of thousands into motion. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the GDR was called a "strategic ally" by the Soviets when 
the old leadership showed symptoms of weakness. Gorbachev, after Malta, warned 
against "artificial acceleration" of the German-German rapprochement. No one 
should ignore the warning noises from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment German mouth-to-mouth reanimation looks to the rest of the world 
like a passionate embrace. But is it really? Unity will be a divisive issue in 
next year's parallel election processes in East and West Germany. On both 
sides, it seems today, clear majorities want it. Should the rest of the world 
also want it, if it cannot be avoided? And under what conditions? 
</P>
<P>
First of all, neither world opinion nor four-power control will be able to stop 
the process if the Germans, in their vast majority, insist upon it. The 
question, however, is how much choice is still left. There is no desire on the 
part of Bonn and East Berlin to upset the world balance, nor do the West 
Germans seriously aim for an isolated solution to the German problem. 
</P>
<P>
What is called the Germany question is not, and has never been, the Germans' 
exclusive property. 
</P>
<P>
They understand full well that they need all available support and assurance 
from the Western Alliance, whether the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or 
the European Community. And for some in the East, the prospects of simply being 
swallowed up is a nightmare; for others it would be a loss of dignity. In 
addition, Soviet security interests have to be respected most carefully; no one 
wants to add to the Soviet leader's backlog of domestic travails. 
</P>
<P>
The West is now faced with a choice: Everything must be done to set up a new 
infrastructure in the GDR, to help repair the environment, put the economy back 
on its feet, invest heavily in a place that promises, a decade from now, 
first-rate returns. The alternative scenario is chaos -- the young generation 
continues to leave, governance breaks down and outside help is wasted: The 
stopping point would be limbo. In any case, East Germany has to go through a 
valley of tears before it can climb the steep road out. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have their own bottom line. Since 1984 the Russians have let it be 
known that saving the GDR is beyond their will and capacity. So a market 
economy, associated with Western Europe, cannot be against their interests. In 
addition, they could hope for much more assistance to perestroika from a 
well-functioning East Germany, associated with the European Community, then 
from a country in paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
A government without old-school communists is now practically inevitable, and 
can also be accepted by the Soviets. But, they underline, GDR sovereignty must 
be maintained, and Soviet security interests are not to be compromised. The 
Warsaw Pact, the Soviets indicate, must be preserved at all cost. But after the 
East European dominoes have all fallen into the democratic direction, surely 
military doctrine and deployment will have to change; after time the Warsaw 
Pact will emerge as a political alliance and part of a more cooperative system, 
or it will become marginal. 
</P>
<P>
As for East German sovereignty -- is not a political confederation of two 
states, closely linked in social and economic terms but set apart in 
international affairs, an acceptable answer, at least for the time being? This 
is what Kohl had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
So far, what is happening in Central Europe is not without great risk, posing 
instability and uncertainty. But it is also a situation of great promise. 
</P>
<P>
On the last day of peace in 1914, Sir Edward Grey, the British foreign 
secretary, said sadly: "The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not 
see them lit again in our lifetime." Perhaps, after 75 years of war and 
waiting, we are about to see the lamps come on again, over all of Europe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nationalism, ethnic identity and religion played crucial roles in shattering 
the communist domination of Eastern Europe. As the extraordinary forces of an 
extraordinary 1989, they were more powerful than the Moscow brand of 
Marxism-Leninism imposed four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Identical forces rise in non-Russian republics of the Soviet Union and they 
erupt in communist Yugoslavia. The process seems to portend the end of a 
historical cycle begun with Russia's 1917 Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Yet nationalism, ethnicity and religion may also create problems no less 
profound in post-communist Eastern Europe -- antagonisms between countries and 
within them. Positive forces can become negative forces, undermining the effort 
to build democracies, reconstruct economies and assure reasonable social 
harmony. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult problems could involve relationships between Poland and the 
German Democratic Republic -- East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In the immediate aftermath of World War II, Stalin annexed Poland's easternmost 
territories, roughly one-third of the country, while awarding to Poland 
Germany's eastern provinces up to the Oder and Neisse rivers. Millions of 
Germans were expelled in the process, losing homes and businesses, and being 
forced to flee to East or West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Long before the fall of communist regimes in Poland and East Germany this year, 
serious frictions had developed between the two governments despite mutual 
memberships in the Warsaw Pact and Comecon, the communist common market. Polish 
and East German warships fired at each other off the Baltic coast over fishing 
rights; East German organizations kept alive anti-Polish revanchism. 
</P>
<P>
A territorial issue exploded only last month, with the collapse of the East 
German communist regime. The sudden possibility of German reunification 
reopened old sores on both sides of the Oder-Neisse border. Ethnic Germans who 
had stayed behind on the Polish side began organizing what Warsaw regarded as 
anti-Polish associations. The East German regime forbade Polish citizens to 
shop for goods on the German side of the frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Warsaw's Gazeta Wyborcza, the new democratic newspaper with 
the largest circulation in Poland, charged that "explosions of anti-Polish 
phobia" among Germans were threatening the democratic order in Europe. The 
front-page editorial appeared just as the Polish government headed by Prime 
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Solidarity leader, made clear that Poland would 
accept German reunification only after all Germans, East and West, formally 
recognized the Oder-Neisse line (as the Western Allies had done long ago). 
</P>
<P>
Finally, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher felt the need to 
announce that "it is completely clear that Germans do not question the Polish 
western border -- now or in the future." But the issue remains. Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl made no such assurances to the Poles in his 10-point program for 
German unification and Genscher's comment may have no impact on German public 
opinion, East or West. 
</P>
<P>
The peril is not a new Balkanizing of sovereignties or frontiers but the threat 
of confrontations among former Soviet satellites and internal chaos. Throwbacks 
to oppression, if not neo-Fascism and anti-Semitism, could result. 
</P>
<P>
Nationalistic or ethnic resentments were papered over during the decades of 
Soviet control, to present an image of communist unity to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Problems in Czechoslovakia also date back to the 1940s. At the end of World War 
II, more than 2 million ethnic Germans were expelled from Czech lands by the 
Soviets. Those people are now agitating in Germany for what they regard as 
their right to return and regain their properties. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland and Czechoslovakia, domestic public opinion angrily opposes such 
agitation, emphasizing that the Germans appear to forget that the existing 
state of affairs was a response to Hitler's war and Nazi occupation. 
</P>
<P>
To protect themselves from German demands, the Poles insist on a clear 
understanding with both Germanys on the inviolability of present borders 
"before it is too late," as the Solidarity newspaper put it the other day. 
</P>
<P>
Territorial problems also exist between Hungary, now moving toward 
parliamentary democracy, and Romania, still under a Stalin-style dictatorship, 
over Transylvania. Stalin had given almost half of the long-disputed 
Transylvanian territory to Romania as a reward, because her armies joined the 
Soviets in the closing days of the war after abandoning the Wehrmacht. Hungary 
did not switch sides. Now Budapest complains that ethnic Hungarians are 
ill-treated in Romanian Transylvania -- and thousands try to flee. 
</P>
<P>
Then come the internal problems, no less divisive, already developing in the 
nations barely out of communist control. In both Poland and Hungary, groups 
that until recently formed anti-communist opposition movements are now in 
power, especially in Warsaw where Mazowiecki is Eastern Europe's first 
post-communist prime minister. Yet deep rivalries are already emerging within 
those groups. 
</P>
<P>
New Polish and Hungarian political organizations are spawning right-wing 
factions that seem to be gaining strength. Renascent anti-Semitism is too often 
their common denominator, although Poland's prewar Jewish population of 3 
million has shrunk to about 12,000 as a result of the Holocaust. Hungary's Jews 
number fewer than 85,000. In both countries, however, many key figures in the 
democratic leadership are of Jewish origin -- as is East Germany's latest 
Communist Party boss, Gregor Gysi -- and the ancient prejudices boil to the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
In West Germany last week, the ultra-right Republican Party, headed by a former 
SS officer, announced plans to form a "sister" party in East Germany. In the 
Soviet Union, more than 70,000 Jews departed this year, a record exodus partly 
stimulated by relaxed emigration rules but also partly impelled by fear of 
nationalism and anti-Semitism within Russian, Ukrainian and Muslim republics. 
</P>
<P>
Old tensions in Czechoslovakia, between Czechs and Slovaks, reappear. During 
the war, a Nazi puppet state was created in Slovakia, headed by Slovaks. Gustav 
Husak, who resigned last week as Czechoslovakia's hard-line president, is a 
Slovak. As the new national leadership takes shape in Prague, one of the major 
issues will be balancing Czech and Slovak sensitivities to prevent a rekindling 
of inter-ethnic hatreds. 
</P>
<P>
In Yugoslavia, still a communist state, the national unity enforced by Marshal 
Tito is crumbling. Since Tito's death in 1980, ethnic and economic differences 
among the six republics and two autonomous regions that make up the Yugoslav 
federation have brought the nation to the brink of conflict and collapse. 
Serbia, the largest republic, is battling the more affluent republics of 
Croatia and Slovenia for political primacy. Croats and ethnic Albanians in the 
southeast have had physical confrontations. The economy is in shambles. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the new decade, at the threshold of a free political and economic 
order, Europe's infant democracies face severe growing pains.

A SHAMEFUL -- AND EXPENSIVE -- LOGJAM AT DEATH'S DOOR; 
</P>
<P>
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: SAN QUENTIN'S GAS CHAMBER HAS BEEN UNUSED SINCE 1967, 
DESPITE THE PRO-EXECUTIONISTS. THAT HUMAN- RIGHTS VICTORY MUST NOT BE LOST.

</P>
<P>
California, with 213 people under sentence of death, has the third largest 
death-row population in the country. No one has been gassed since Aaron 
Mitchell on April 12, 1967. 
</P>
<P>
This is an extraordinary phenomenon. For 17 of the 22 years since the Mitchell 
execution, the state's death-penalty law was constitutional. Every opinion poll 
showed the public overwhelmingly supporting death as just punishment for 
heinous murder. 
</P>
<P>
Then why no gassings? Some history is in order. 
</P>
<P>
From 1967 to 1972, California was a de facto non-executing state. In 1972, the 
California Supreme Court ruled in People vs. Anderson that the death penalty 
violated the state constitution's cruel-and-unusual-punishment clause. Also 
that year, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Furman vs. Georgia, struck down all 
death-penalty statutes across the country. But four years later, the nation's 
top court held that the death penalty was not intrinsically unconstitutional 
(Gregg vs. Georgia). 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the California Legislature passed a discretionary capital-punishment 
statute written by then-state Sen. George Deukmejian. Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr.'s veto was overridden. The stage was set for two generations of 
death-penalty laws. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years later, the pro-capital punishment lobby, long mindful that Chief 
Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird stood between it and executions, launched a 
statewide TV campaign using murder victims' relatives as the spokespersons. In 
the fall of 1986, state voters ousted Bird and two other justices, Joseph R. 
Grodin and Cruz Reynoso, who were perceived to be anti-death penalty. Gov. 
Deukmejian replaced them with justices more willing to let the punishments 
proceed and Malcom M. Lucas was appointed chief justice. By 1989, the Lucas 
court had reversed 29% of all death-penalty cases brought before it, compared 
with the Bird court's 87% reversal rate. 
</P>
<P>
In all, then, 15 years of dogged legislating to produce workable death-penalty 
laws plus the use of every available ploy to assemble a "hanging court" -- yet 
still not a single gassing. 
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of death sentences. Indeed, they are being handed out in 
record numbers nationwide. Coupled with the slow pace of executions, the rush 
of death verdicts has created a human logjam on death row. At the end of 1988, 
2,182 persons faced execution in 37 states; only 11 were carried out. At that 
rate, it would take 200 years to exhaust the existing stock of death-row 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
California's executioners would need 12 1/2 years to dispose of the state's 
death-row population even if they equalled the record rate set in 1935-36, when 
17 persons were hanged. (Besides murder, kidnaping and rape were then 
punishable by death). But since the death-row population grows by 30 prisoners 
a year, by the end of that 12-year period, there would be nearly twice as many 
awaiting death as when the executions started. 
</P>
<P>
The country and state would have to accept an execution policy unprecedented in 
democratic history to make the death penalty work. Short of that, capital 
punishment will remain a lottery, with the dice heavily loaded against the poor 
and minorities. But since the United States will never resume executions on a 
grand scale, I believe the whole shameful process should be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
The death penalty further clogs an already overtaxed legal system. The sheer 
number of capital-appeal cases weighs so heavily on the California Supreme 
Court, despite its rubber-stamp approach to them, that it has little time for 
other state business. Death-penalty cases bounce around the courts for years, 
gobbling up tax dollars. Jury selection in a capital case can increase trial 
cost by $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the death penalty is a big fiscal drain on California. The most 
conservative estimate of the cost of a death-penalty sentence is $1.5 million; 
others go as high as $5 million. Many lawyers believe that the expense of 
maintaining San Quentin's death row since 1976 is in excess of half a billion 
dollars. By contrast, the tab for keeping a man in jail for his natural life is 
$600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting criminal-defense costs is certainly no way to save money. The $4.6 
million price tag for the retrial of mass murderer Juan Corona should be a 
sobering reminder of how expensive incompetent counsel can be. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the money saved by abolishing capital punishment will hardly satisfy 
relatives of victims. The prospect that families of victims and the community 
at large will have to endure a life of unrequited moral outrage is a powerful 
argument against abolition. But since only one murderer in 1,000 will ever be 
executed, the very existence of the death penalty ensures that the victim's 
relatives will always be denied "equal justice." 
</P>
<P>
There is the other human flotsam in death-penalty cases, the always-forgotten 
and totally denigrated family of the executed man or woman. They are innocent 
victims, too, although guilt by association hangs heavily over them. 
</P>
<P>
Execution of the innocent is frequent enough to justify ending the death 
penalty. "It is better that 10 guilty persons escape than one innocent suffer" 
was how Sir William Blackstone made the point in 1751. No one knows how many 
innocent persons have been executed since then. But Randal Adams in Texas, 
James Richardson in Florida and Ronald Monroe in Louisiana are innocent men who 
languished on death row for many years before they were recently released. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the greatest misconception about the death penalty is that capital 
punishment makes us safer. The United States long ago abandoned mutilation, 
branding and the lash as punishments -- all once thought significant deterrents 
to crime. Yet people intuitively cling to the one remaining and ultimate 
physical punishment in the hope that it will protect them. Truth be told, 
execution is no better deterrent to violent crime than protracted imprisonment, 
and never has been. 
</P>
<P>
If Californians can resist the desire to copy the killer, that would be a great 
human-rights victory. For let there be no doubt: Capital punishment is a rights 
issue. It is condemned by all human-rights groups as well as by all mainstream 
religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech days before his assassination, Robert F. Kennedy said, "Whenever 
any American's life is taken by another unnecessarily, whether it is done in 
the name of the law or in defiance of the law, by one man or a gang, in cold 
blood or in passion, in an attack of violence or in response to violence -- 
whenever we tear at the fabric of life which another man has painfully and 
clumsily woven for himself and his children, the whole nation is degraded." 
</P>
<P>
California has not executed anyone in more than two decades. Let us remain on 
this human-rights high ground and refuse to seal someone inside a cylinder 
while dropping cyanide pellets into sulfuric acid.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I say, old boy, PBS suddenly has a rival for the Anglophile market. C-SPAN, the 
cable network that transmits the House and Senate, is showing excerpts from the 
British House of Commons. "Masterpiece Theatre" buffs may be slightly 
disappointed: Only one man, the speaker, wears a wig. Still, the names, the 
accents, the suits are magnificent. 
</P>
<P>
Sir Fergus Montgomery complains of injustice to war widows, with reference to a 
letter in the Times of London. A Scottish lady discourses earnestly about what 
sounds like "genital affairs." Wait, make that, "general affairs." The Tory 
benches are a forest of foppish pinstripes. The U.S. House of Representatives, 
by contrast, generally goes in for silly diminutive nicknames ("Newt," "Vin") 
and baggy suits of solid blue. In lieu of stripes, the American members festoon 
themselves with pins and badges representing various political causes and 
patriotic themes. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointingly, there is not a lot of Wildean witticism in Parliament. Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher's style, aped by a chorus of young Tory sycophants, 
is one of heavy-handed sarcasm. "Perhaps we had better wait and see so we can 
pontificate in the light of the facts," she sneers in response to a complaint 
of some sort. 
</P>
<P>
More entertaining are the old-fashioned class-war thrusts from venerable 
members of the Labor Party. It's less Oscar Wilde than Clifford Odets. "The 
minister can shake his head . . . don't shake your head at me. . . ." 
(Colleagues: "You tell 'em, Frank!") "He's got a garage with a couple of cars 
in it. I've got people back in my constituency who have to walk because they 
can't even afford a flippin' bus." To a setup question to Thatcher from one of 
the Young Sycophants (something like: "Would the prime minister agree that the 
past 10 years have been the most glorious chapter of history since mankind was 
expelled from Eden?"), a Laborite yells: "Get off your knees!" 
</P>
<P>
Even among political opponents, there is far more debilitating politesse in the 
American House than in the British one. Vast amounts of time are wasted 
praising bipartisanship, thanking the member for his cooperation and so forth. 
Watching several hours of a recent House session for comparison's sake, the 
only actual disagreement I heard was a polite tiff between two Florida 
representatives about which one had more "seniors" in his district. 
</P>
<P>
The House of Commons show vividly demonstrates one advantage of the 
parliamentary system: the distinction between the head of government and the 
head of state. Margaret Thatcher, world-reknowned for her haughtiness, 
undergoes a twice-a-week ritual of humiliation-by-questioning that would be an 
unthinkable act of lese-majeste if inflicted on our "jes' folks" Presidents. 
"Will the prime minister now make a public apology for this gross 
incompetence?" Has she not been rendered "a pygmy on the world stage" by 
something or other? Will she not "be swept from office and dumped in the 
garbage" soon? All accompanied by cheers from one side, jeers from the other. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher gives as good as she gets, but the whole process has a democratically 
healthy leveling effect. Indeed, after watching Parliament for a while, 
C-SPAN's House of Representatives show suddenly seems like "Hamlet" without the 
prince of Denmark. The lead character in the drama -- President Bush -- is 
mentioned often but never appears. 
</P>
<P>
"Question time" -- the twice-a-week session where the prime minister and her 
Cabinet are interrogated by other members -- replaces two institutions of U.S. 
democracy: congressional committee testimony by Cabinet secretaries and 
presidential press conferences. 
</P>
<P>
American Cabinet members justifiably complain of the time they spend preparing 
for and appearing at hearings. Usually in these sessions the Cabinet member and 
the interrogating politician are both just mouthpieces for aides, who can often 
be seen on C-SPAN striking the classic Washington pose of leaning forward from 
behind and whispering in the boss's ear. In Parliament, the questions and 
answers are brief and there are no aides in sight. 
</P>
<P>
As for the presidential press conference, Question Time would offer the perfect 
answer to the perennial question, "Who elected Sam Donaldson?" Free of the need 
to appear objective or fair, opposition MPs ask tougher questions than White 
House correspondents would dare. Better-framed, too. "Why are there more young 
people now begging on the streets of London and our other big cities?" Thatcher 
was asked the other day. Could even Donaldson have put it so straight, without 
a little speechlet to blunt its force? 
</P>
<P>
C-SPAN, established a decade ago by the enterprising Brian Lamb, has turned 
into a wonderful adventure in true-life political theater. Funded by the cable 
industry and run on a shoestring, it fills the airtime between sessions with 
what might be called "found democracy": committee hearings, think-tank 
seminars, State Department briefings, a charity "roast" in honor of a bigshot 
journalist, a showing of campaign commercials by the Democratic Senatorial 
Campaign Committee, whatever's available. 
</P>
<P>
And there's more fun ahead. Lamb was just in Jerusalem trying to get permission 
to broadcast the Israeli Knesset. Mel Brooks, look to your laurels!

CARS, BUSES AND AIR QUALITY

<P>
Wright was exactly right. Our growing traffic and air pollution problems in 
Southern California will not improve until we change our driving habits -- a 
step most of us are very reluctant to take. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that some combination of governmental agencies, the news media and 
environmental organizations will conduct a public education campaign to bring 
about the necessary change in our attitude towards the automobile. After all, 
there is more to consider than smog and traffic congestion, which are bad 
enough in themselves. What about severe pollution damage to trees in nearby 
national forests, carbon dioxide contributing to global warming, environmental 
damage from oil drilling and transport, and increasing reliance on foreign 
energy sources in politically unstable regions? 
</P>
<P>
As an immediate first step, how difficult would it be for most of us to reduce 
our driving by 15% by eliminating unnecessary trips? 
</P>
<P>
And think of the example for the rest of the world if Los Angeles, of all 
places, was able to clean up its air and traffic!

CARS, BUSES AND AIR QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "We're Driving Ourselves to a Lousy Quality of Life in Our Smog-Maker Cars," 
(California Commentary, Dec. 4), Judy Wright advocates greater use of buses to 
cut pollution and speed traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to imagine how buses could be better for the environment when 
they all seem to belch far more soot per passenger than most cars. Likewise, it 
is hard to see how buses could decongest our highways and byways. More often 
than not, what's causing a jam is a big, clumsy, lane-straddling bus that's 
incapable of attaining reasonable speed or even clearing an intersection. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, when I lived near Washington, D.C., the bus drivers went on 
strike for two weeks during the heat of summer. There were dire predictions of 
all-day traffic jams, but commuting turned out to be a dream -- because there 
weren't any stop-and-go snails blocking the way! 
</P>
<P>
My hunch is if we got rid of buses altogether the air would be cleaner and we'd 
all spend a lot less time on the roads. 
</P>
<P>
There's no way buses can be the answer. They're too busy being part of the 
problem.

GROWTH: DISEASE OR BLESSING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You sometimes get the idea that Los Angeles County Supervisors never met a 
building project they didn't like, no matter what damage it might do to the 
environment or to what extent it will cram more autos onto the roads. The board 
voted 4-1 this past week to permit the filling of another canyon on the Malibu 
coast, this time for a golf club, resort and exclusive homes. 
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley was providing the sort of 
leadership the region needs by trying to reduce the impact of a $2-billion 
project north of Chatsworth that involves 2,195 homes, 1,200 townhouses and 
nearly 6 million square feet of office space. Bradley threatened to veto the 
project unless the developer built homes that are affordable to less-affluent 
buyers, reduced parking space to encourage ride-sharing and transit facilities 
and provided a better mix of residential and commercial property. 
</P>
<P>
And when City Councilman Hal Bernson, the project's sponsor, modified the plan 
to get itthrough committee on a 2-1 vote, Bradley accurately labeled the 
alterations as cosmetic and said they do not change the fundamental problems of 
the massive development. The full council should reject the plan as currently 
proposed. If not, Bradley should veto it. 
</P>
<P>
At Malibu, the developer asserted that the resort was planned to protect the 
environment. That would be some trick: Approximately 5 million cubic yards of 
dirt would have to be moved to fill in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California needs development -- and redevelopment -- that provides new 
jobs and affordable housing. But this surely does not mean filling canyons 
along the coast or building super-scale projects that will further overload 
highways and other public facilities. There must be limits, or else the 
cumulative impacts of growth will overwhelm the natural assets that made 
Southern California so attractive to newcomers in the first place.

CRACK COCAINE TRAFFICKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there were in existence a Hall of Injustice or a Hall of Infamous Decisions, 
Judge David W. Williams' sentencing of Winrow to life imprisonment without 
parole for possessing 5.5 ounces of crack cocaine would deserve to be enshrined 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The harshness of that decision illustrates what so many of us know from bitter 
experience -- that black people in this country are routinely denied equal 
protection and fundamental fairness, which are fundamental rights under the 
U.S. Constitution. It is this kind of denial which has overloaded our prison 
system to the breaking point. This kind of denial is the principal reason that 
blacks, though comprising only one-eighth of this country's population, 
constitute nearly one-half of all prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Williams' rationalization of his harsh sentence being required by the 
fact that "Congress has gone out to battle the drug war and this man is one of 
the enemies" is unconvincing. If this is war, and Winrow is an enemy soldier he 
is still entitled to humane treatment. 
</P>
<P>
It is apparent that Judge Williams was troubled by this whole affair, indicated 
by his linking his own blackness to Winrow's. But Judge Williams' identity 
linkage to Winrow is a flawed one. Although both of them faced endemic racial 
segregation and discrimination, there are important differences. The poverty, 
unemployment, violence, drugs, and poor and irrelevant education which 
continually confront today's young blacks are far more virulent, relatively, 
than these conditions were in 1932, when Judge Williams was 22. 
</P>
<P>
When I first met Judge Williams more than 35 years ago, I found him to be a 
gracious, generous and elegant human being. I admired his sense of justice and 
fair play when, as one of the first -- if not the first -- black judges to sit 
in Pasadena, he dismissed a gambling charge against some black defendants, on 
the grounds that whites were never prosecuted for the same offense. Thus, I 
personally regret writing this critical letter. 
</P>
<P>
A miscarriage of justice of this magnitude endangers the life and health, not 
only of the black community, but that of all America.

The lesson couldn't have been clearer: One item in The Times reports that 
Richard V. Winrow, a black and ghetto-bred 22-year-old man, was sentenced to 
prison for life for dealing a small amount of cocaine (Part A, Dec. 7). 
</P>
<P>
The other item reports the hardly remarkable fact that large American companies 
have been profiting handsomely from the sale of millions of gallons of 
specialized chemicals vital to the making of the cocaine found in Winrow's 
possession (Part A, Dec. 5). The chemicals, it is reported, are shipped openly 
from Houston to Colombia in amounts far exceeding any legitimate need. 
</P>
<P>
The tragic irony is that Winrow loses his freedom forever; the corporate heads 
probably get a bonus for improving the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
It might logically be said both are businessmen; as one company is said to have 
retorted: If we don't supply it, they'll only get it somewhere else. Indeed! 
Winrow could not have said it better.

HELPING FAMILIES STAY TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a time of year when so much emphasis is placed on family, there are a 
half-million children in the United States who are separated from their 
parents, and one in five of them are in California. The number of children 
living in some sort of foster care -- foster homes, mental health and detention 
facilities -- mushroomed by 44% in California during 1985-88. The national 
total is expected to climb to 840,000 in five years, according to a report by 
the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families. Despite this 
monstrous trend, there are some immediate steps that can be taken to quell this 
troubling increase, and Ventura County is leading the way in California. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County stands as the model of a system whose main goal is to preserve 
the family unit by intervening early in crises. By using psychiatric social 
workers, counselors, educators, corrections and probation workers, county 
officials have set up a system to help families work through the myriad 
problems that tear families apart. 
</P>
<P>
If necessary, such as in cases of violence, the child can be placed with foster 
parents or in a group home. But child services cases do not always involve an 
abusive parent and a terrorized child: Sometimes a child is absent from school 
or runs afoul of the law because, for example, father is absent and mother is 
depressed and does not know how to handle the meager family finances. In 
response, Ventura County would typically call upon its network of social 
service professionals to help the child and mother through a difficult period, 
working together in the home. One way to measure the impressive results: As of 
1987, welfare placement costs declined in Ventura County, with an annual 
savings of $226,000 that offset 16% of the project costs. 
</P>
<P>
No one suggests that Ventura County's approach to child welfare is a panacea 
for the underlying societal ills that have caused the deterioration of the 
American family. But the county is proving the value of the proverbial ounce of 
prevention.

DEFENSE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before we begin to make the deep military budget cuts presently being proposed 
by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, let us wait for the Soviets to turn their 
talk and promises of peace and disarmament into reality. It would be foolish 
for us to cut our defenses during this delicate time in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Both World War I and World War II started from the collapse of powerful 
empires: We may now be witnessing the collapse of the Soviet empire. 
Consequently, I believe we should be cautious and avoid the discredited 
McGovernite policy of unilateral disarmament.

POSTWAR TOUGH GUY FROM TOKYO; 
</P>
<P>
ACTS OF WORSHIP BY YUKIO MISHIMA TRANSLATED BY JOHN BESTER (KODANSHA 
INTERNATIONAL: $17.95; 205 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Anderer, Anderer is chairman of the Department of East Asian Languages 
and Cultures at Columbia University. He writes on Japanese fiction, criticism 
and film.

<TEXT>
<P>
Living in post-heroic Japan, Yukio Mishima wanted something to revere. Not 
content merely to think worshipful thoughts, he pumped muscle into his frail 
frame, donned a French-designer military uniform, and, between cameo roles in 
yakuza (mob) flicks and photography sessions (with sword in the snow, arrow in 
the armpit, rose clenched in the teeth), set out to battle secular corruptions 
of every kind. 
</P>
<P>
He thus came to appear a hero, which proved fatal, since Mishima had no faith 
in the world of appearances. Heroes could not just dress the part, they had to 
act it. Yet without a war in which he could actively be heroic, Mishima staged 
wars in his writing, where he fought on behalf of romantic passion, the sea, 
the Emperor, etc. Then he took a scene he had enacted countless times in his 
fiction -- of ritual self-sacrifice -- and made it the last act of his life. 
</P>
<P>
If we continue to take notice of this by turns brilliant and erratic writer 20 
years after his death, perhaps it is because Mishima, almost alone of his 
generation, tried to reclaim an aura lost amid the smug, complacent materialism 
of postwar Japan. The exquisite style should not camouflage the fact that 
Mishima was a political writer on a mission: to reconsecrate a homeland on 
which might once again shine a sun "speckled with golden dust." 
</P>
<P>
This is the language of the seven stories collected here -- all, to varying 
degrees, literary "acts of worship." As such, they represent minor if telling 
repetitions of rituals enacted on a grander scale, often with greater coherence 
or conviction, in "Confessions of a Mask," "The Temple of the Golden Pavilion" 
or "The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea." John Bester, the accomplished 
translator, alerts us in his preface to traits as common to Mishima as they are 
to other great writers: "a certain restriction of theme; an evident 
self-indulgence." A few of these stories succumb to such liabilities. Some use 
them to impressive effect. 
</P>
<P>
A regular, even obsessive, subject of these writings is youth, as it edges 
toward the brink of some wickedness. Stories like "Cigarettes" and "Martyrdom" 
put a nearly playful use of decadent images to a serious purpose: "to overthrow 
the bourgeois world." In "Fountains in the Rain," a boy whips himself into a 
romantic frenzy, not for his girlfriend -- which would be a banal and 
predictable romance -- but for the chance to walk out on her. 
</P>
<P>
Even a fable like "Sea and Sunset," becomes an excuse to follow a young French 
shepherd who, bedazzled by a vision exhorting him to "go East," joins the Fifth 
Crusade, suffers en route in an Alexandrian slave market and later makes 
passage to India and eventually to a Zen monastery in Japan. It is Mishima's 
nod to Flaubert's "Salammbo," whose Orientalist style he evidently admired. 
</P>
<P>
"Raisin Bread" features an international cast of barbiturate-popping, 
suicide-talking drifters, who perform in succession the twist and a "primitive 
dance ritual" at a beach party, replete with bonfire, roasting pig and conga 
drums. These preliminaries, along with asides to the shark-nuptial passage in 
Lautreamont's "Maldoror," make possible the kinky menage a trois during which 
the hero munches on a moldy piece of raisin bread, "bitter and sour as ever, 
and the more he ate the more it clung around his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
However noxious, these youthful flowers of evil are preferable to Mishima's ode 
to healthy adolescence, the long and turgid "Sword." "Nothing matters but 
training." "We're here to suffer, not enjoy ourselves." Such lines are repeated 
by a group of young men, anxious to improve both fencing skills and character. 
Their submission to martial austerities, familiar at once to readers of 
Japanese comics and fans of Rocky/Rambo, is predicated on a befuddled wish: "He 
couldn't understand why society in general wasn't uncomplicated and beautiful, 
like the world of sport." 
</P>
<P>
The title story, and by far the finest work in the collection, is a haunting 
portrait of devotion to an ideal, at the cost of human feeling. A widow, age 
45, who "lacked all feminine appeal," becomes housekeeper to her poetry tutor. 
She is consumed by a "need to look up to someone," while he is consumed by the 
memory of a lost love. Deformed by "excessive self-awareness, like wings 
unsuitably large for the body," he responds to his admiring housekeeper with a 
medieval injunction ("the importance in art of concealing one's emotions"), 
calculated to repress and stifle love. 
</P>
<P>
At his best, Mishima remained equally alert to the sublimity, the cruelty and 
the silliness made possible by excessive devotion. "Acts of Worship" well 
documents the visions and the delusions projected by Mishima's devotional art.

PRE-WAR TOUGH GUY FROM CHICAGO; 
</P>
<P>
NELSON ALGREN A LIFE ON THE WILD SIDE BY BETTINA DREW (G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS: 
$27.95; 416 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Clancy Sigal, Sigal, a journalist and author of Going Away and Zone of the 
Interior, teaches at the USC School of Journalism.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nice people didn't like Nelson Algren. The Chicago-bred author of "The Man With 
the Golden Arm," "A Walk on the Wild Side" and a number of immortal short 
stories about America's dispossessed behaved too much like his fictional 
characters for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
What can you do about a major writer who -- this fine biography tells us -- 
liked the poor, did his fieldwork in low-rent bars and "walked and talked with 
a sort of pre-war style, tough but not mean, when by now it should have been 
the other way around"? Or who believed that "literature is made upon any 
occasion when a challenge is put to the legal apparatus by conscience in touch 
with humanity"? 
</P>
<P>
Algren, who passionately craved success, wasn't willing to buy it at any price. 
The result was that, still at his peak, he became a "non-person" in American 
literature, a Nelson Who? everywhere except in Europe, where readers idolized 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Early in his abused childhood, Algren grasped the gut-connection between 
winners and cheaters. He preferred honest crooks to the respectably corrupt, 
and he didn't go out of his way to conceal his feelings. "A p.r. guy he 
wasn't," one of his friends is quoted in Bettina Drew's sympathetic but 
level-headed biography. 
</P>
<P>
Incorruptibly honest but naively convinced nobody could outsmart him, Algren 
was easy pickings for on-the-con Hollywood producers (like Otto Preminger, who 
did the film version of Algren's "The Man With The Golden Arm") and whores with 
hearts of lead. Algren was like J.D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield with his 
impossibly high standards for adults. Disillusionment was in the cards, and 
Algren -- a compulsive gambler -- played poker with his life like a man 
possessed of honesty like a fever. 
</P>
<P>
Algren's sense of kinship between his own and other people's pain was formed in 
the Great Depression. Jewish working-class in origin, Nelson Algren Abraham 
(his real name) was an ordinary boy of the Chicago streets with an 
extraordinary view of his own possibilities. He was viciously knocked about by 
his German non-Jewish mother Goldie, who took out on him her rage at marrying a 
simple garage mechanic who couldn't even add up the bills nobody paid. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson's dad was a loser's loser. Trapped, Nelson went upwardly mobile in two 
seemingly contradictory directions: to college, and into the lower depths of 
"pool halls, bowling alleys, tenement houses" and brothels of Chicago's 
northwest side. "Even at 17," his biographer writes, "he seemed to know his way 
around the underworld without fear." 
</P>
<P>
Like many "wild boys of the road," Algren hoboed all over America, ending up in 
a Texas jail for stealing . . . a typewriter, what else? With his eyes, ears 
and a notebook, he soaked up a Depression-era country of back streets and 
shadowy alleys "where relationships meant nothing, where money was more 
important than life, and life was so cheap as to be valueless . . . (a) world 
of outcast people with its own customs and values." The horror fascinated him. 
The repressed violence beneath the smooth skin excited his creative lust. 
</P>
<P>
Algren, this boxcar sociologist, instinctively understood, from his own family 
cruelties, how America was governed. If the fix was in -- and it always was -- 
there were only two classes: wardens and prisoners, powerful and powerless. 
Like so many writers of his period, he sided unequivocally with the scum of the 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
It was normal to be a left-wing writer in the '30s -- in Chicago, his best 
literary friend, Richard Wright, was a Communist, and James T. Farrell a 
Trotskyist. What sat Algren apart was that he refused, all through his fat 
years, to abandon either his friends or his principles when America was 
offering a bounty on leftists. 
</P>
<P>
In 1949, Algren's "The Man With The Golden Arm" was an instant smash. Suddenly 
he became world-famous. Even in Chicago, where his previous novel "Never Come 
Morning" was removed from public-library shelves at the order of a grafting 
mayor, he was appointed temporary hero, mainly because he was making money for 
the first time. He also became gossip-worthy as "Lewis Brogan," the American 
heir of Simone de Beauvoir's best-selling novel "La Mandarine." Beauvoir, who'd 
fallen in love with Algren and his dry, perverse humor -- he showed her a 
police lineup and the electric chair on their first date -- called him "my 
beloved husband." But her long-time liaison with Jean-Paul Sartre took 
precedence, which hurt Algren. Although endowed with a "European" sensibility, 
Algren never caught on that Beauvoir's idea of a "contingent love" simply meant 
high-class husband-swapping. 
</P>
<P>
A chronic loser at the track and poker table, Algren also was suicidally slow 
to grasp changes in literary and political fashion in an America growing scared 
and suburbanized in the '50s. The FBI, which kept an active file on Algren, 
denied him a passport. Despite strong recommendations from Ernest Hemingway and 
Carl Sandburg, he was refused a Guggenheim. 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, many critics, themselves ex-radicals, blasted Algren because of 
his bias toward the destitute and oppressed. Norman Podhoretz couldn't fathom 
why Algren "finds bums so much more interesting and stirring than other 
people." Leslie Fiedler called him a "museum piece." Literary academia loathed 
Algren as one of the "destroyers of the social order." The "conservatism of the 
'fifties," Drew notes, was making him "seem more like a freak than a serious 
novelist." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Algren became a pawn in the larger dispute "that exiled the whole 
urban-sociological tradition from the hall of fame of American letters," Drew 
quotes one of Algren's few academic defenders. Perhaps most important, the 
writer's human base dissolved under his feet. The Poles and other Chicago 
ethnics Algren doted on moved elsewhere, leaving him stranded in the old 
neighborhood now full of Latin-Americans whose language he was simply getting 
too old to learn. A way of life -- at every level -- was being lost. 
</P>
<P>
Marginalized, unable to get an advance for a new novel, he fought back by 
moving to New Jersey to research a book about black boxer Rubin (Hurricane) 
Carter, jailed for a double murder Algren believed he didn't commit. But life, 
or women, or the critics had beat some of the stuffing out of him. He never won 
The Big One again. 
</P>
<P>
Algren died in 1974. "I speak only for those who leaped or fell," he once said 
in a poem, "losers being the only ones left with something to say and no one to 
say it." One example: Because of his experience in America's drug world, out of 
which he drew The Golden Arm's "Frankie Machine," Algren decided that 
"narcotics constituted a medical problem, not a police matter." 
</P>
<P>
I'd like to think that Algren, who loved putting on sober folks with his loud, 
checked jackets and wide, Day-Glo ties -- the uniform of "a short-odds bettor 
at the two-dollar window of a downstate Midwest racetrack" -- would finally be 
acceptable today. 
</P>
<P>
But with those clothes, that manner, these views, I wonder.

MURDER IN A REMOTE NEIGHBORHOOD;

<P>
ASHES OF IZALCO BY CLARIBEL ALEGRIA AND DARWIN J. FLAKOLL TRANSLATED BY DARWIN 
J. FLAKOLL (CURBSTONE PRESS: $17.95, CLOTH; 0-915306-83-2; $9.95, PAPER; 173 
PP.; 0-915206-84-0)

<TEXT>
<P>
Born in Nicaragua but reared in El Salvador, Claribel Alegria is the author of 
the prose poem, "Luisa in Realityland," about the intrusion of war into the 
life of the Salvadoran upper class, and the co-editor of the bilingual poetry 
collection, "On the Front Line: Guerrilla Poems of El Salvador." If she is 
something less than the poetess laureate of the FMLN rebels, her sympathies are 
clear from her bibliography. 
</P>
<P>
They would seem to be equally clear from the title of her latest work, 
co-authored in 1966 with her husband, Darwin J. Flakoll, but only now released 
in English. Izalco is a Salvadoran town near the Guatemala border, named for a 
nearby volcano. It was there in 1932 that the most infamous mass murder of la 
matanza, the decade-long Salvadoran slaughter of the 1930s, took place. 
Hundreds of disarmed Indians, their thumbs bound together, were herded into the 
central plaza to hear an address by Gen. Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez. But 
the truck that was to have brought the general brought, instead, an army death 
squad. The captives were machine-gunned to the last man and boy. 
</P>
<P>
Against this background, the title, "Ashes of Izalco," would seem to announce a 
phoenix, the guerrillas of yesterday arising as today's Frente Farabundo Marti 
de Liberacion Nacional. The epigraph to the book, from Francisco de Quevedo, 
only reinforces the initial impression. Translated, it reads: 
</P>
<P>
 They will be dust, 
</P>
<P>
 but the dust will have feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Ash, but the ash 
</P>
<P>
 will be in love. 
</P>
<P>
Quevedo was a satirist, however, and there is something inverted, if scarcely 
satirical, about "Ashes of Izalco." Which is to say that, quite deliberately, 
it does not keep its opening promise. Though it is set during the Salvadoran 
civil war of the 1930s, and though all its characters know that a war is under 
way, no major character ever speaks a line for either of the contending sides. 
Neither the rebels nor those who are beating them back are granted much 
personal or ideological space in its pages. Here are no Marxist guerrilla 
voices, no North American imperialist voices, and only rarely, even in a 
culturally conservative, upper-class setting, anything approaching a foursquare 
authoritarian or militaristic voice. 
</P>
<P>
The novella is, instead, a visit to Graham Greeneland in which the usual roles 
of observer and observed have been exchanged. There are, in the Greene manner: 
a dissolute American writer, fleeing his past; an earnest Seventh-Day-Adventist 
missionary whom he knew as a boy and has sought out in his extremity; a hot, 
dusty, isolated tropical town, its ancient upper class smug, its primeval lower 
class numb; and one beautiful, restless woman, reading French novels and 
yearning for someone to talk to, the wife of the chess-playing, patriarchal, 
conventionally macho town physician. What makes the result decidedly 
un-Greene-like is that the observing, interpreting, organizing intelligence is 
local and often female rather than foreign and male. 
</P>
<P>
The novella opens just after the death of Isabel, the doctor's wife. Carmen, 
her daughter, having returned home for the funeral, has found, among her 
mother's papers, the diary of Frank, the American writer, whom she remembers 
only vaguely. What she learns from the diary is that Frank and her mother had a 
brief, passionate affair -- they slept together just once -- and then parted. 
To Frank, the Salvadoran beauty was a last chance at a new beginning. To 
Isabel, the American was a beginning that could only entail a dozen cruel 
endings. He had already cut all his ties. After her night with him, she 
discovered the power of hers -- and chose them over him. 
</P>
<P>
As Carmen's thoughts interrupt and interpret her reading of Frank's diary, the 
novella becomes, for all its brevity, two kinds of story: the love story of 
Isabel and Frank; and a middle passage for Carmen, who, married to a 
passionless American and living in the United States, measures her distance 
both from Santa Ana and from her husband by the depth of her mother's 
unsuspected pain. 
</P>
<P>
Why then the title and the epigraph? What has this intensely personal melodrama 
to do with the ashes of Izalco? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is not at all obvious, but what the book has to do with Izalco may 
be what America has to do with El Salvador. The United States as a political 
power is absent from this novella: No diplomat or soldier ever makes an 
appearance. American culture, people and products, however, are omnipresent. 
Virgil, the missionary, exhorts his peasants to reform their agriculture as 
they reform their lives (he dies with them at Izalco). Frank implores Isabel to 
abandon her life in Santa Ana and share his. A Santa Ana dowager, gossiping 
about a recent wedding, notes approvingly that all the gifts were imported from 
the United States. Finally, the narrator herself -- reading a stranger's diary 
and discovering her own mother -- is married to an American and residing in 
Washington, D.C. Like so many of her countrymen, she has made our country hers. 
</P>
<P>
It is this cultural traffic, the novella hints, that has made it possible for 
the ruling class of El Salvador to regard that country's civil war rather as 
Beverly Hills might regard the drug wars of South Central Los Angeles; that is, 
as trouble in a remote neighborhood. (El Salvador is no larger in area than Los 
Angeles, Orange and San Diego Counties combined.) Mulholland Drive doesn't know 
and isn't eager to learn what the LAPD or the FBI or the DEA is doing on Martin 
Luther King Boulevard. Whatever it is, it's probably necessary. In "Ashes of 
Izalco," the upper class of Santa Ana regards most of El Salvador just that 
way. In innumerable ways, the United States is far more vividly present to the 
upper-class mind (as Manhattan might be to Mulholland) than the local rebels 
are. 
</P>
<P>
The Izalco massacre, as described in Frank's penultimate letter to Isabel, 
comes thus as a late and monstrous intrusion rather than a true climax. Frank 
Wolff does not interpret the atrocity. Neither does Carmen Rojas as she reads 
his diary, decades later. If the reader is invited to interpret it, the 
invitation is severely muted. 
</P>
<P>
Not least for that muting, "Ashes for Izalco" is an unsatisfying book. Isabel, 
provocatively personal with Frank without departing from the propriety of her 
station, is an intriguing character. Frank, whose debauched past is attributed 
rather than evoked, is a good deal less intriguing; and unfortunately, Frank, 
through his diary and letters, does most of the talking. For its brevity, 
moreover, the novella is overcrowded with minor characters. 
</P>
<P>
And yet it is often interesting and always alive. Farabundo Marti, an offstage 
presence, is described as Augusto Sandino's secretary. Other details offered in 
passing provide -- against the authors' transparent determination not to write 
a conventional political novel -- background information on the long-running 
civil war. More important, the central subject -- Isabel's refusal to escape 
and Frank's ensuing despair (chronicled in his last letters to her) -- grows in 
power when joined to the memory of the Izalco massacre. Alegria and Flakoll may 
decline every opportunity to draw parallels. We are left wondering, 
nonetheless, whether the ashes of Izalco are not of at least two kinds.

WINTER QUARTERS BY OSVALDO SORIANO TRANSLATED BY NICK CAISTOR (READERS 
INTERNATIONAL: $17.95; 192 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
Colonia Vela is a dull town on the Pampas of Buenos Aires Province. It consists 
of gray buildings of no distinction, a fatuous local bourgeoisie, a theater 
where the best people go to hear chamber music, an outdoor club where the rest 
of the people watch boxing or soccer, and a brothel on the edge of town. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the brothel, it could be an Argentine version of Gopher Prairie. But 
it is a Gopher Prairie taken over by the equivalent of invaders from outer 
space. These have landed, killed some of the townspeople and turned most of the 
others, under their sleepy small-town normality, into robot-like servitors. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the effect, in Osvaldo Soriano's witty and desolate tale, of the 
occupation of Colonia Vela by the Argentine armed forces. Soriano has written a 
parable of what the military dictatorship did to Argentina, though it reads 
less like a parable than a loony transformation of a Raymond Chandler action 
story. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly, only action is involved, but once the action plays itself out, a 
sense of universal corruption remains. Here, the corrupters are not 
millionaires and crooked politicians but a brutalized army with absolute 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
One warm spring day, two outsiders get off the train from the capital. Each in 
his own way is an entertainer, brought in to star in a civic festival organized 
to celebrate the town's contentment under the tutelage of the Fifth Air Cavalry 
regiment. As with any military-sponsored spiritual manifestation, contentment 
is obligatory. We used to have good times, reflects Mingo, the town bum and 
dissident, "when nobody came along to tell you when you had to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
The two arrivals -- they are almost shot at the station until it is explained 
that they have been sent for -- are a classic odd couple. Galvan, an unemployed 
pop singer, is nervy and cynical. Rocha, a fading boxer trying to make a 
comeback, is a 6-foot-9 hulk, impetuous and dumb. Together, they bumble their 
way through the nightmarish town like Mutt and Jeff in Hell. 
</P>
<P>
Told in Galvan's irascible voice, their ordeal begins with a kind of undermined 
welcome. At the town restaurant -- it is grubby and fancy at the same time; a 
sickly refinement attends the consumption of huge portions of meat -- they are 
greeted effusively by Aguila, businessman and local big shot. 
</P>
<P>
He takes them to his house, filled with crucifixes and silver-framed 
photographs. He offers them wine, or rather, because he aspires to cultivation, 
"Burgundy." "Anything, so long as it's red," says Rocha, the simple dolt. 
"Burgundy is always red," says Aguila, the pretentious dolt. 
</P>
<P>
Aguila explains their roles at the festival, which he has ostensibly organized, 
though the real organizer turns out to be the Fifth Cavalry's cultural officer, 
Capt. Suarez. Galvan will sing before a select audience of town notables and 
officers. Rocha will be the popular attraction; he will fight the regiment's 
champion, Lt. Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
Aguila has the flowery jitters. It would be best if the two visitors mostly 
stayed indoors. If interviewed, they must be sure to commend the army. He will 
come by the next day to take them to Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha is willing. He has caught sight of Aguila's repressed daughter, Martha, 
and fallen instantly in love. Galvan is not; instead of Mass, he goes to a 
cafe, meets Mingo, and hears about the old days before the army arrived to 
quell the opposition. It burned down half the town in the process, and 22 young 
people died. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, things have been peaceful, though everyone has a friend or a 
relative who was killed or disappeared. The townspeople talk about it sadly but 
calmly, like an epidemic. The young people who survived have left town. Mingo 
looks wistfully at a book Galvan has brought along. "My father used to read a 
lot," he says. Argentina is despoiled and etherized. 
</P>
<P>
As far as power goes, brutality is almost no longer necessary. But an army 
exists for display; what use is power if you don't flaunt it? It was not enough 
to kill the Jesuits in El Salvador; according to some reports, it was necessary 
to mutilate them afterwards. And as the book goes on, the army's hold on 
Colonia Vela becomes increasingly overt. 
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers in mufti -- Fatso and Gary Cooper are Galvan's names for them -- 
drift around in one of the notorious unmarked Ford Falcons used by the 
Argentine death squads. They beat up Rocha and Galvan when the latter refuses 
to give them an autograph; they smash Rocha's right hand. He will be leading 
with his left, in any case, they point out helpfully. And Capt. Suarez calls in 
Galvan, says he is on a political black list, and suggests he get out of town 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Galvan stays, and the action speeds up. There is an engaging slapstick scene in 
which Rocha is discovered in bed with the virginal Martha. There is pestilent 
comedy when Rocha and Galvan attend a Vivaldi concert played by the Fifth Air 
Calvary Regiment Chamber Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Between winter and spring, the army boxer is introduced. He makes a speech 
saying that the fight is one more mission he undertakes on behalf of "the real 
Argentina." Rocha stands up and bellows insults. The musicians stand up in 
their turn, lay down their instruments and pull out their guns; Rocha is 
escorted out. The trap is evident. The old boxer has been cast not as a 
contender but as the Enemy. He must be crushed. 
</P>
<P>
In the climactic fight, absurd, suspenseful and horrifying by turns, he is 
indeed crushed. A helicopter hovers overhead; when Rocha leads, it descends a 
few hundred feet; when Sepulveda is ahead, it lifts. And when the lieutenant is 
almost knocked out, the chopper roars down, scattering audience and chairs and 
the remains of Rocha's wits. He is beaten half dead. 
</P>
<P>
In the final scene, Galvan pushes him across town on a hospital gurney to the 
railroad station, where they stumble aboard the train back to Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
"Winter Quarters" suffers from sloppy construction. Short as it is, there are a 
couple of scenes -- one in the brothel, for example -- that have no evident 
reason for being there. The specific Argentine tone of cordial abusiveness is 
very hard to capture in English; Nick Caistor translates it rough and awkward. 
</P>
<P>
But it is an absorbing and chilling satire. Near the end, as Rocha lies in a 
near coma, the sadistic Gary Cooper asks Galvan for his autograph; this time, 
Galvan consents. The young soldier is ecstatic; he helps get the boxer up onto 
the gurney. For a moment, he is simply an ordinary, star-struck young 
Argentine, and that is the worst thing of all.

By PATRICIA MACLACHLAN, MacLachlan won the 1986 Newbery Medal for Sarah Plain 
&amp; Tall. Her 1980 story, Arthur, for the Very First Time (Harper Junior) 
recently was reissued in paper.

"Read a story," my mother once told me, "and find out who you are. Or write 
one," she added, "for the same reason." What she was talking about was the 
strong connection that readers and writers have to story, the connection that 
compels you to read or write to find a piece of yourself there somewhere; an 
image or smell perhaps that takes you back to another place and another time. 
</P>
<P>
When a book has this "Ah!" factor, you can read it time and again and still 
startle yourself with recognition. These six picture books are about 
connections, different though they may be: two nonfiction books connect us with 
place, two others with time -- we see us ourselves in old tales; another is 
about friends, and the last looks at how we become who we are . . . if we're 
lucky. 
</P>
<P>
William T. George's Box Turtle at Long Pond (Greenwillow Books: $12.95), 
illustrated by Lindsay Barrett George, is a lovely mix of story and information 
(I never knew that box turtles couldn't swim!). A simple yet lyrical account of 
a day in the life of a box turtle, it begins with a wonderful full-page spread 
of the mist-covered pond we soon will explore. We are invited into the small 
but dramatic world of the turtle as he survives weather, a curious raccoon and 
the rigors of food gathering. The art is so astonishingly detailed that more 
than once my hand went out expecting to touch grass, a birch log, or rock. This 
book is about connection to place, but it is also about the connections among 
the creatures who live at Long Pond. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Arnosky's splendid In the Forest (Lothrop, Lee &amp; Shepard Books: $13.95) 
is a portfolio of paintings and text that revere and respect the forest and the 
power it has for change. Here are forest secrets revealed (the beaver hidden in 
his winter lodge) and kept (the brook disappearing underground, the grouse 
camouflaged by a copse). "If you can't find the bird in the painting, I'll 
understand," writes Arnosky. "I never would have noticed it myself if it hadn't 
flown." Through the conversational narrative and the magnificent oil paintings, 
Arnosky's intimate connection to the forest becomes ours. Because of this book 
I will walk in my forest with new eyes and ears. 
</P>
<P>
We see ourselves in It's Too Noisy! (Harper/Crowell: $12.95), Joanna Cole's 
retelling of an old Jewish folk tale. A farmer lives in a little house with his 
noisy family and wishes for peace and quiet. The farmer seeks out a wise man 
who wields ancient wisdom to help the farmer to appreciate the loving clamor 
that surrounds him. The text is rhythmic, and Kate Duke's numerous watercolor 
illustrations evoke a world where much more is happening than words can depict. 
While the farmer doubts the Wise Man's words, for instance, the Wise Man's cat 
-- just as smart as a cat can be -- smiles reassuringly. My favorites are the 
pigs, who, unlike most humans, are wise enough to be as happy at the beginning 
of the tale as they are at the end. 
</P>
<P>
Tales of a Long Afternoon (E. P. Dutton: $13.95), Max Bolliger's retelling of 
six of Aesop's fables, weaves a fox, a raven, a turtle, a hare, a peacock, a 
crow, a dog, and a wise lion and mouse together in a community of friendship, 
but not until their very human faults bring out the worst in them. Aesop's 
tales have been retold by many, but Jindra Capek's stylized paintings are 
especially good at showing their timelessness. The volcano that erupts during 
the central conflict smolders at story's end, for instance, showing us that 
envy, jealousy and vanity may erupt at any time again. This story will play 
itself over and over. 
</P>
<P>
In Margaret Wild's Mr. Nick's Knitting (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $12.95), Mr. 
Nick and Mrs. Jolley are not only close friends but also kindred spirits -- 
they both knit. Mr. Nick knits "sweaters, big ones and small ones, for his 22 
nieces and nephews, who grew bigger every year," and Mrs. Jolley (the "very 
untidy knitter") knitted toys "like hedgehogs and kangaroos, monkeys and 
lions." When Mrs. Jolley is ill and lonely, Mr. Nick knows exactly what to do, 
as only a thoughtful and imaginative friend would. Dee Huxley's illustrations 
glow with color, and there is a wonderful sense of freedom and movement in the 
pattern of this book, as if it might have been put together by a joyous 
knitter. 
</P>
<P>
Natalie Babbitt has written and illustrated a story that is deceptively simple. 
Revealing more with each reading, Nellie: A Cat on Her Own (Farrar, Straus 
&amp; Giroux: $11.95) focuses on a marionette cat who lives "in the cottage of 
a clever old woman" and only dances when the old woman pulls the strings for 
her. Nellie is content -- content enough not to wish for anything more than she 
has -- until a worldly cat named Old Tom enters Nellie's life. A free spirit 
who knows more about life than Nellie ever knew to ask and is not afraid to say 
so, he tells her, "It would be better if you danced all on your own." "I could 
never do that," Nellie responds, but when the clever old woman dies, she has no 
choice. It is Tom who says what is, for me, the most important line in the 
story when he takes away Nellie's strings. "If I don't," said Big Tom, "they'll 
get in the way and tangle up." 
</P>
<P>
Connections? After reading "Nellie" I suddenly remembered my adolescent 
daughter looking up at me and asking once: "Just when are we grown up anyway?" 
Maybe there's still time to give her this book. This story, illustrated by the 
author's lovely, serene pictures filled with light, is about the risks and the 
joys in growing up to be strong and independent. It is for all ages. And for 
all parents.

CAPTURING THE ROMANCE OF THE TAJ; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY MUSEUM EXHIBIT OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST CELEBRATED BUILDINGS IS A GIFT 
FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Romance of the Taj Mahal," opening today at the County Museum of Art, is a 
wondrous exhibition that is at once scholarly, affectionate and generous -- 
like the Magi bearing exotic gifts for the holidays. It spills forth about 250 
exquisite miniature paintings, architectural models, details and drawings, 
precious jewels, sinister daggers, waxen jades and lush textiles. 
</P>
<P>
It is, irresistibly, about love. As the world knows, the Taj Mahal was built as 
a tomb by the Mogul emperor Shah Jahan in Agra on the banks of the Jamuna River 
after the demise of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. She died during a military 
campaign in 1631 while giving birth to her 14th child. 
</P>
<P>
The Taj became one of the world's most celebrated buildings, not because it is 
a great historical monument like the pyramids of Giza or the Greek Acropolis, 
but because of the refinement of its design, the richness of marble and inlay 
and -- most of all -- the romance that fueled it. 
</P>
<P>
In an old Noel Coward play estranged lovers meet. He has taken a trip around 
the world to ease his broken heart and she asks him if he saw a sacred elephant 
in India. "They're lint white, I believe, and very, very sweet," she says. "Of 
course you saw it in the moonlight." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," he replies, "moonlight can be cruelly deceptive." 
</P>
<P>
That elephant was surely the Taj. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition (through March 11) is the brainchild of LACMA's super-smart 
senior curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art, Pratapaditya Pal. Specialized 
sections were supervised by Janice Leoshko, Joseph M. Dye III and Stephen 
Markel. All contributed to a catalogue that virtually must be read to get the 
most from the show. Scholarly enthusiasm occasionally overloads prose (and 
readers' fuses), but tenacious attention is rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
The show is deeply engaging even without the catalogue in mind, but it is also 
a curious business. For one thing, it is a Godot-like play in which the main 
character, of necessity, never appears. The closest we get to the Taj is 
through a large model that acts as the exhibition frontispiece. This replica 
was made by an Agra jeweler. In 1939, it came to the New York World's Fair and 
was later picked up by an Indian expatriate who used it as the centerpiece for 
his restaurant in Florida. When it came to LACMA, it was encrusted in curry 
grease. 
</P>
<P>
In short, this serious exhibition launches itself with a substantial piece of 
kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
Pal's catalogue introduction concentrates amusingly on modern commercial 
exploitation such as an advertisement that shows a splendid view of the Taj 
mirrored in its famous reflecting pool. The caption reads, "When Shah Jahan saw 
the contractor's bid did he say, 'Make the pool a little smaller?" -- a 
question aimed at persuading consumers that it's worth it to pay more for 
Johnny Walker Red Label Scotch. 
</P>
<P>
The curator has donnish fun pointing out other examples, such as the rock-blues 
musician who took "Taj Mahal" as his nom de microphone. Now his friends say, 
"Hi, Taj" and headwaiters greet him solemnly as "Mr. Mahal." 
</P>
<P>
This is all a giggle, but emphasis puts a different spin on the show, giving it 
the aura of a contemporary media-art exhibition out for social criticism and 
demythification. The catalogue's final section is devoted to representations of 
the Taj mainly by later Europeans. Part of Pal's thesis is that nobody thought 
the building was such a big deal until the British moved into India. He wonders 
out loud whether the romance of the Taj is not largely a Western rather than an 
Indian phenomenon. The section proves the point, but in a funny way, because no 
really substantial Western artist ever messed into the place except Rembrandt, 
who collected Indian miniatures at a distance. One is inclined to see the 
mystification of the Taj as part of the 19th-Century Romantics' passion for the 
exotic. But no big-name European artist was ever magnetized to India in the way 
Morocco attracted Delacroix or the South Seas seduced Gauguin. Just too far, I 
guess. 
</P>
<P>
The big cheeses here are no more renowned than England's Albert Goodwin, 
Japan's Hiroshi Yoshida and the American photographer Mitch Epstein. The 
section fizzles slightly on account of this but underlines the Taj's charm as 
being probably as much a popular as an aesthetic phenomenon. When we set the 
comparatively clunky Euro-American art next to the ethereal delicacy of 
original Mogul, one thing is certain: We may love the Taj, but we got her 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Instructive as this section is, there is a tendency for the concept to swamp 
the art and hint of sourness in the subtext. 
</P>
<P>
It is dispelled by Shah Jahan's art as by a spoon of raspberry ice. 
</P>
<P>
He descended on one side from the Mongol emperor Genghis Khan (Mogul comes from 
Mongol) and on the other side from Timur -- called Tamerlane -- making this 
exhibition a direct continuation of LACMA's recent estimable, "Timur, the 
Princely Vision." While Shah Jahan's ancestors are towering historical figures, 
he is best remembered as a patron and aesthete. There is something rococo about 
his aesthetic. Floral motifs appear everywhere, heavy with religious symbolism 
but rendered with tremulous sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Shah Jahan didn't live in the real world. His story suggests a kind of 
miniature epic. Born in 1592 under the most favorable astrological 
configuration, he nonetheless had a father (the emperor Jahangir) who was a 
drunk and a druggie. The boy was promptly taken away from his mother and 
spoiled rotten by a surrogate and his grandfather, Akbar. When it came time to 
ascend the throne he had to battle his stepmother for his rightful place. Years 
later, when he was old and ill, his sons schemed, poisoned and fought over the 
succession. Not a very nice bunch in the crunch, but you would never know it 
from the art. 
</P>
<P>
Idealization is the hallmark of Shah Jahan's art. We see the real world through 
it but with the sting removed. When a respected old man is caught en flagrante 
in bed with a young boy, the shock and humiliation of it are muffled into a 
rather kindly prank. There is a kind of moral tolerance running through the art 
that recalls Lady Murasaki's classic "Tales of Genji." 
</P>
<P>
In the paintings, much of this effect comes from our natural response to things 
in miniature, but there is more to it. Shah Jahan employed some of the most 
gifted artists of his day. They lose nothing of inventiveness and skill in 
drawing a head the size of your fingernail. Balchand's illuminations, like "A 
Warrior Frightened by Tribesmen," cast an aura of legend over a plausible 
event. A preference for night settings lends mystery. Govardhan's "Four Mullas" 
is a dream seen through the veil of dusk. Anonymous images of birds and animals 
have a Rousseau-like presence that reminds us that poetry was virtually the 
native language of the culture. Mogul realism has the rich greens of Oz, and 
its kaleidoscopic abstract designs tinkle with the trees of the seven dancing 
princesses. 
</P>
<P>
In reality Shah Jahan was a busy ruler who rose at dawn and worked until 
evening. The art shows only moments of pomp and relaxation: an equestrian night 
wedding feast that seems illuminated by a million fireflies, harem girls 
bathing at night, the prince watching an elephant fight, the prince communing 
with ascetics. 
</P>
<P>
If life is poeticized, its reality of a bedizined existence is proved by the 
decorative arts section with its gourd-shaped jade bowls, sumptuous jewels and 
fabrics as light as butterfly wings or as textured as fur. Occasionally another 
reality intrudes, in push daggers designed to maximize the fatal thrust. 
</P>
<P>
It is a pity to have so little architecture in a show about the Taj Mahal. But 
photos, drawings and fragments can only do so much. At least what they do 
underlines the essence of Shah Jahan's aesthetic. There is a fragment of a 
beautifully carved screening door on view that looks from a few paces off like 
wood. It turns out to be stone and that sense of lightness turns out to be a 
central clue. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy enough for a Western cynic to suspect that both the fact and 
symbolism of the Taj are not really about romance but about luxury -- an easy 
mistake to make at the end of the voracious '80s. 
</P>
<P>
But anybody who takes a really good look must see that in the end it is about 
luxury transcending itself. Indian visitors from philosophers to plebes have 
remarked on how the Taj seems weightless and otherworldly. This art begins with 
luxury but comes out the other end as a dream of perfumed peace, sensual ease 
and grace.

FANTASY AND FOLKTALES; 
</P>
<P>
A QUARTET OF 'KEEPERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NATALIE BABBITT, Babbitt is the author and illustrator, most recently, of 
NellieA Cat on Her Own (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux), reviewed on Page 7. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among this year's crop of children's fantasy books, there are, as usual, a few 
that are well worth their price -- what we used to call "keepers." Choosing 
books for children is a gamble, of course, for a book finally is a personal 
thing; we cannot always explain why we are fond of one and not another. Still, 
they can be a compliment to the recipient and as good a message of love as any 
I know. 
</P>
<P>
The best method is to pick a book that you know you would have liked when you 
were a child. I was delighted by Melisande (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $13.95; 
unpaged), a story written almost a century ago by the durable British 
children's author, E. Nesbit, with brand-new illustrations by British artist P. 
J. Lynch. From the tale's beginning -- a princess is cursed with baldness at 
her christening by the requisite bad fairy -- you know this will be an amusing 
story, distinguished by Nesbit's tongue-in-cheek adherence to fairy-tale 
conventions. After a bald childhood, Melisande finally is given a leftover wish 
of her father's. She asks for hair that will grow an inch a day, and twice as 
fast each time it's cut. 
</P>
<P>
Disaster! In no time at all she is going to bed with her hair cut short and 
waking up with a mile of it clogging her bedroom. The confusion and problems 
all are cleared away by a wise prince, but he isn't so wise that he doesn't 
make a few mistakes, for which you only like him better. 
</P>
<P>
Another keeper is Ute Krause's Nora and the Great Bear (Dial Books: $11.95; 
unpaged). I didn't think so at first, for the pictures are thin, colored 
cartoons difficult to appreciate without the text. The story is quickly told: 
Nora, a modern little girl, goes out into the snowy forest with the village 
hunters to search for the Great Bear. They all carry weapons, but don't let 
that put you off; this is more a pilgrimage than a hunting expedition. 
</P>
<P>
No bear is found, so Nora, frustrated, goes off to look on her own without her 
weapons, wandering so deep into the forest that she loses her way. Night falls 
and she is beginning to despair when the Great Bear appears, huge and silent in 
the moonlight, and leads her back to camp, whereupon he disappears, leaving no 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
The story is special because of what it has to tell about the elusive realities 
of nature and because of Krause's subtle style. Once understood, the story 
gives her simple pictures a deeper meaning. Though neither beautiful nor 
skillful, they convey the lonely cold of the forest and avoid trivializing the 
bear, even though he is only a cartoon. Perhaps a more gifted illustrator would 
have gone too far and spoiled the magic. At any rate, I found the two halves, 
words and pictures, nicely wedded at last. 
</P>
<P>
Another book-with-pictures that is not simply a picture book is Virginia 
Hamilton's The Bells of Christmas (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $16.95; 59 pp.) 
illustrated by Lambert Davis. One of our very best children's writers, Hamilton 
has managed over the years to write about African Americans with wisdom and 
truth, never once shrill or accusatory, letting events and very human 
characters make their own statements. 
</P>
<P>
Here, she creates the story of a black family's Christmas out of her mother's 
memories of Christmas holidays in Ohio around the turn of the last century. 
This is a middle-class Christmas, full of love, security and comfort, and the 
statement is clear: The media's heavy hand notwithstanding, this country always 
has had a black middle class, prosperous and hard-working, living free of the 
big-city ghettoes, with strong family ties and strong family values. 
</P>
<P>
The story, as well as Lambert Davis' pictures, are calm and dignified, rooted 
and serene; they take their time. Both reflect careful historical research in 
their richness of detail and make a beautiful Christmas book for people of any 
age. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I would like to recommend an odd and very entertaining work of 
nonfiction that can help save parents from the wrath of their children when it 
is discovered that, after all the hoopla, there isn't any Santa Claus. In Who 
Is Santa Claus? The True Story Behind a Living Legend (Canongate Publishing 
Limited, Edinburgh, distributed by David &amp; Charles, Inc., North Pomfret, 
Vt: $22.95; 104 pp.). Robin Crichton explains how the legend developed and 
spread from the historical 2nd-Century Nicholas to the present-day fat man in 
red velour. Chrichton is a film maker, and this book came along after he made a 
movie called "The Curious Case of Santa Claus," which the book's jacket claims 
has been widely successful. I hadn't heard of it, but never mind; the book 
itself is engrossing, well told and full of fascinating details covering the 
Santa's evolution throughout the Western world. 
</P>
<P>
The numerous pen-and-ink decorations by Margaret Nisbet, including maps, are 
poorly reproduced and all too abundant, so the less said about them the better. 
The book is not really for children, anyway; rather, parents should read and 
absorb it in order to be ready to say, when the time comes, "Yes, Virginia, 
there is a Santa Claus if you look at it this way: It all began nearly two 
thousand years ago . . . " and I think children will understand that behind the 
hokum there is something quite real that has answered and will go on answering 
a widespread human need for a very long time.

On Aug. 12, 1819, 11 days after Herman Melville was born, the American whaler 
Essex was attacked and sunk by an enraged bull sperm whale, estimated to be 85 
feet long. First Mate Owen Chase published his recollection of the attack in 
1851, supplemented with brief accounts by the captain and second mate. As even 
a cursory reading reveals, Melville used these memoirs as the basis of the 
final, climactic chapter of "Moby Dick." (His copy of "Narratives" survives, 
along with 18 pages of notes.) Not surprisingly, Chase's descriptions of the 
whale's fury lack the power of Melville's writing. But his memories of the 
terrible suffering the crew endured as they struggled to reach the coast of 
South America -- more than 2,000 miles from the site of the attack -- in open 
whaleboats retain their strength and poignance.

A pleasantly silly catalogue of improbable-looking 19th-Century appliances, 
presented in a guess-what-this-is format. Perusing these photographs of soap 
savers, chicken waterers, cartes de bal and sugar nippers offers the nostalgic 
pleasure of a stroll through a turn-of-the-century hardware store. However, the 
reader is left with the disquieting notion that in 2089, Bragdon's grandson 
will publish a similar volume devoted to such quaintly impractical devices as 
the fax machine, car phone, computer mouse and Walkman.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: WAITING FOR AN ARMY TO DIE THE TRAGEDY OF AGENT ORANGE BY

Fred Wilcox's scathing indictment of the reckless use of toxic herbicides 
during the Vietnam War and their devastating effects on the men who were 
exposed to them combines elements of Randy Shilts' "And the Band Played On" 
with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring." Wilcox discloses that the defoliants 
sprayed on more than 4.5 million acres of Southeast Asia were contaminated with 
dioxin, the most deadly man-made molecule in existence. (A fatal dose is 
measured in parts per billion.) 
</P>
<P>
Young soldiers who were contaminated with dioxin now allegedly suffer a hellish 
array of medical problems, including liver and neurological damage, elevated 
rates of cancers usually found only in older men, depression, and fathering 
children with severe, multiple birth defects. Wilcox also charges that the 
Veterans' Administration has deliberately failed to provide these men the 
treatment they so desperately need. 
</P>
<P>
An important book, simultaneously infuriating and depressing; but even if it 
provokes public outcry, treatment -- and justice -- will come too late for many 
Vietnam veterans.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: PACO'S STORY BY LARRY HEINEMENN (PENGUIN: $7.95)

<TEXT>
<P>
The pain that Paco suffers from the hideous wounds he received in Vietnam pale 
before the cruel indifference of the people he encounters in a small Midwestern 
town when he returns home. Paco is not one of the cliched, murderous, 
drugged-out vets of pop fiction, but a simple man, thwarted in his search for a 
decent life. His story is told in rambling monologue by the unnamed "ghost" of 
a dead buddy, and Heinemenn argues in this powerful, National Book 
Award-winning novel, that the callous indifference of the American people has 
reduced Vietnam veterans to living ghosts. How can the wounds that Paco and 
thousands of others endured ever heal if the scabs are constantly being pulled 
off through neglect and voyeurism?

The Boy Scouts and the PTA, two "apple pie" groups, can't agree on who should 
assume liability for any "bad apple" Scout leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The California Congress of Parents, Teachers and Students Inc., the state PTA 
organization, has told its local chapters to stop sponsoring Boy Scout troops 
or Cub Scout packs. 
</P>
<P>
Of 10,000 Scout units in California, about 600, mostly Cub Scout packs, are 
currently sponsored by neighborhood school PTAs, according to Richard Parker, 
assistant director of the Boys Scouts' Western region. 
</P>
<P>
The action could sever relationships between school PTAs and Scout units, both 
composed of parents usually from the same neighborhood, that have existed for 
as long as half a century. 
</P>
<P>
The California PTA action, contained in a memo this fall from state PTA 
President Dorothy Leonard, came after the national PTA and the Boy Scouts 
failed to reach agreement after more than a year of negotiations over who 
should take responsibility for screening Scout leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Each Scout troop or pack is sponsored or chartered by an organization, such as 
a school PTA, church or civic club. 
</P>
<P>
The Boy Scouts in 1988 wrote new charter application and renewal forms that 
place the responsibility for screening, selecting and approving local Scout 
leaders on the sponsoring organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is the sponsoring organization should be primarily responsible 
for screening local Scout leader candidates. Who can better assess them?" said 
Lee Sneath, Dallas publicist for the Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
National PTA President Manya Ungar wrote in an October, 1988, letter to state 
and local PTAs, "In the view of our legal advisers this responsibility could 
result in increased liability to PTA units, and possibly to their leaders, 
should some unfortunate situation develop involving the leadership of the local 
Scout organization." 
</P>
<P>
The two national groups began negotiations in mid-1988 that continued through 
this year. During that time, until July 1, 1989, the Boy Scouts agreed that the 
use of the new forms would not change the relationship between the two groups 
that existed before the forms were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
However, since 1976 the California PTA has been using its own form for 
sponsoring Boy Scouts and other youth groups. That form committed the local PTA 
only to helping secure qualified adult leadership, helping arrange for a 
meeting place and providing opportunities for youth service. 
</P>
<P>
The July 1, 1989, deadline came without a resolution to the problem on the 
national level. 
</P>
<P>
The national PTA informed its state chapters of the deadlock and is leaving 
decisions up to them. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing that says they can or cannot sponsor Boy Scout troops. That's 
up to the local units," said Tari Marshall, public relations director for the 
national PTA. 
</P>
<P>
She said a few states have recommended that local units not sign charters. 
</P>
<P>
The Illinois PTA advised its local units not to sign Boy Scout charters in 
October, 1988, said Illinois President Gretchen McDowell. "Our liability 
insurance put a waiver in so it will not cover any Boy Scout activity." 
</P>
<P>
"We know it's a very difficult issue. My kids were Boy Scouts. It has nothing 
to do with a very fine organization, the Boy Scouts. It has to do with us 
accepting responsibility for their leaders." 
</P>
<P>
She said other youth groups, such as Girl Scouts, recruit and train their own 
leaders and do not require sponsoring organizations to accept responsibility 
for the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard of the California PTA sent her letter to local units in September, just 
as the school year began and many Scout troops and packs were organizing for 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Since no agreement between PTA and Boy Scouts has been reached, and since the 
California State PTA youth group sponsorship form is no longer being accepted 
by the Boy Scouts, PTA units in California are to refrain from signing any 
youth group sponsorship form with the Boy Scouts of America," the letter 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard said she plans to meet with Parker, who is based in Sunnyvale, to try 
to resolve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have a problem, but we believe it can be worked out," said Parker, who 
said the two groups are meeting both on the state and national level. 
</P>
<P>
"We met in June, but you can't really call it negotiations," said Marshall of 
the national PTA, based in Chicago. "The Boy Scouts have set up things the way 
they want it set up. Really, it's up to Boy Scouts to come back to us if they 
feel they want to make a change." 
</P>
<P>
Parker notes that the Boy Scouts carries liability insurance for all its 
registered leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the Boy Scouts was started, we have asked chartering partners to screen 
or approve leaders," he said. "The leadership comes out of their neighborhoods 
and they know them better than we do. We then train them." 
</P>
<P>
He said if a school's PTA won't sponsor a Scout group, then a group of parents 
in the neighborhood could get together and sign the charter. 
</P>
<P>
"Not in one instance have we had a PTA say we don't like you and don't like the 
program," said Parker.

'COMPASSION FATIGUE' HITS PEOPLE WHO CARE TOO MUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Doctors, social workers and therapists are giving a new name to a syndrome they 
say is draining their ranks: "compassion fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
It strikes people who take on too heavy a load of other people's burdens, 
leaving little time or energy for themselves. Victims become disillusioned and 
depressed, and often start to show cracks in their professional veneer. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone that I work with is affected by it. I've felt it in myself," said 
social worker Lydia Parsons of the Mid-Maine Medical Center in Waterville. 
"I've had other people tell me about it, about me, before I was aware of it." 
</P>
<P>
Compassion fatigue is gaining recognition. A half-dozen presentations were 
devoted to it at a recent National Assns. of Social Workers conference. Dr. 
Edward Poliandro of Mt. Sinai Medical School in New York said people "were 
hanging from the rafters" to hear his workshop on stress management. 
</P>
<P>
Some hospitals are offering support programs that feature stress management 
classes, longer staff meetings and even daily walks through the park. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 20% of care-giving professionals suffer such burnout, said Dr. Lyle 
H. Miller, head of the Biobehavioral Institute in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Typical victims sound almost like TV stereotypes of social workers or doctors, 
working too much, sleeping too little, sacrificing their own lives and families 
for case after case. "It's the best and the brightest and the most committed 
and the most energetic that burn out," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons is a classic example. As director of the social work department at the 
Redington-Fairview Hospital in Skowhegan, Me., she was running on empty so 
often she couldn't do anything very well. "I always felt guilty even going for 
lunch, because there was always someone waiting for me." 
</P>
<P>
Parsons quit that job and, after a break in which she worked part-time, joined 
Mid-Maine, where there are frequent staff meetings and peer-support sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Welch, a former Catholic priest who left a Boston-area hospice 
program after a decade of helping the terminally ill deal with the prospect of 
death, said that he had been happy with his work but that it was too consuming 
to stay good at it for long. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very heavy emotional material. It's not something that anyone should do 
for a very long time," said Welch, who left both the church and the hospice in 
1985 and now owns an Italian restaurant. "You get a sense that the whole world 
is dying after a while. I heard a friend say I was a downer, I should find a 
way to lighten up." 
</P>
<P>
Compassion fatigue went unrecognized for a long time because of the stigma 
attached to it, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Very often people in any line of field would be looked down upon if they were 
to acknowledge they were really stressed out," said Poliandro, who teaches 
stress management at the Mt. Sinai Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a double standard of being in the helping profession, that we should 
be able to see it in ourselves" before anxiety becomes a crisis, Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
When perfect employees ignore their stress they can become an administrator's 
nightmare, Miller said. They can develop headaches, backaches, fatigue, 
depression and irritability. They might start to abuse drugs and alcohol, or 
begin not showing up for work, Poliandro said. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to fight compassion fatigue? 
</P>
<P>
Take a vacation, Poliandro and Miller agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators can help, however. The boss can force workers to take lunches 
away from their desks, outlaw working past 9 p.m. or forbid employees to work 
weekends, Poliandro said. 
</P>
<P>
At Mt. Sinai, personnel can enlist in the "wellness" program, which offers, 
among other activities, daily walks through nearby Central Park. "It's a rapid 
walk, to build up their health, but also they do it just to enjoy being outside 
and away from the pressures of the office," Poliandro said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, professionals who help people have to teach themselves how to stave 
off the needs of their own patients, said Miller and Poliandro. 
</P>
<P>
"Humans have a tremendous capacity to be resilient," said Poliandro. "They just 
have to be able to replenish their energy."

SENSUOUS SENIORS;

<P>
CALENDAR 'GIRLS' 50 TO 73 GIVE LIE TO THE STEREOTYPE OF AGING'S NUMBERS GAME

Tired of being represented by spokesmen for Geritol, an entrepreneur in his 
golden years has compiled a calendar of women who, at ages 50 to 73, are young 
enough to get slightly giddy at the idea of being a calendar girl "at my age." 
</P>
<P>
The Sensuous Seniors 1990 calendar, featuring 12 San Joaquin Valley women, 
demonstrates there's more to advancing age than sleep aids and laxatives, says 
the calendar's creator, 53-year-old Max Wegerbauer. 
</P>
<P>
And there's pleasing irony to enlightening consumers to the breadth of 
middle-age with a calendar -- the very reminder of advancing years. 
</P>
<P>
Says Maxine Fredericks, the 73-year-old model for May, "Just because the 
calendar says you're a certain age doesn't mean you're old." 
</P>
<P>
As 50-year-old Roberta Collins demonstrates on the July display, 20-year-olds 
aren't the only ones whose figures deserve to be shown off in a bathing suit. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Miss January, Marlene Hansen, a professional model and manager of an 
American Cancer Society Discovery Shop, reclining in the back of a limousine 
and toasting her 53 years with a glass of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time I thought of using glamorous people like Jane Fonda, Tina Turner 
and Lena Horne. But, one, I couldn't afford them. And people would say they 
were the exception to the rule," said Wegerbauer, who produced the calendar 
that is available in six states. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Wegerbauer found, the only rule for aging gracefully is staying active 
and keeping a positive outlook -- a life style not confined to those who earn 
their livings in more glamorous professions. 
</P>
<P>
Wegerbauer's Sensuous Seniors include a former skater with the Ice Capades, an 
artist who likes to lift weights and play the flute, and a school district 
employee who begins her day by bouncing on a mini-trampoline. 
</P>
<P>
"Because 'senior' implies sedentary, our goal is to change the image of 
seniors. We want 'senior' to imply living life to the fullest," Wegerbauer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what they portray is the positive side of what's going on. They have a 
wisdom and a view toward life that is much broader than what you have earlier 
in life. As seniors, we have more compassion, we have more time to love." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from active life styles, the 12 women also shared experiences that 
persuaded them it was time to let the rest of the world know that their days 
aren't consumed with thoughts of retirement, illness or the fit of their 
dentures. 
</P>
<P>
"When I turned 55, I went into a restaurant and I looked at the menu and saw, 
'Senior Citizen Special, 55 and older.' I thought, 'How degrading,' " said 
59-year-old Marion Pistoresi, who is pictured decked out in leather and 
straddling a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts you in a different league, that you're not capable, you're over the 
hill. I can do anything a young person can," said Pistoresi, who helps run 
family-owned vineyards in Madera County. 
</P>
<P>
Wegerbauer said his jolt came when, at 50, he received a brochure from AARP, 
the American Assn. for Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
"When I turned 50, I just started thinking differently," he said. "I wanted to 
make a statement about us seniors. We are active, vibrant, passionate, alive 
and in control of our lives. And, if we want to be, we are glamorous." 
</P>
<P>
But maintaining the qualities of youth is still only half of being a Sensuous 
Senior. Many of the women say they appreciate what the years have given them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a better peace of mind and the wisdom you gain over the years makes it 
easier to get through the day-to-day things. There's a maturity," said Carol 
Alverson, 55.

U.S. PET OWNERS GOING HOG WILD FOR PINT-SIZED VIETNAMESE POTBELLIED PIGS

"Sparky" may be the trendy new house pet of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
He won't bite the mail carrier or howl at the moon. He's bigger than a cat but 
smaller than a Doberman. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't shed, smell or claw the furniture, and prefers a tidy litter box to 
the living room rug. He'll walk on a leash, swim, fetch or just sit and watch 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
And the worst thing you can say about him? Well, he's a pig. A Vietnamese 
potbellied pig. 
</P>
<P>
These pygmy porkers have become popular pets in the last couple of years, 
despite hefty prices, ranging from about $1,500 for a neutered male to $35,000 
for a pregnant female. 
</P>
<P>
Pig owners boast that their pets learn quickly and have sunny dispositions. 
They don't get really big -- full-grown, they weigh between 20 and 150 pounds 
(as compared to hogs, which can weigh half a ton). But right now, just about 
the only way to acquire a Vietnamese potbelly is to get plugged into the 
nationwide breeders' network. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Sparky's owner, Kris Bryant, comes in. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant breeds and sells Vietnamese potbellied pigs through her company, 
Paradise Pigs, and keeps her customers updated on pig care and feeding through 
a homey newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
(From a recent issue: "It has been brought to my attention that some of you are 
unsure of how much to feed your piggies, and some are even letting them 'pig 
out' (pun intended).") 
</P>
<P>
Bryant is also about to launch Pet Pig Update, which she bills as "the first 
magazine devoted to miniature pet pigs!" And she was recently elected to the 
board of the newly formed North American Potbellied Pig Assn., with 
headquarters in Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
As one of a handful of Vietnamese potbellied pig breeders, Bryant is 
particularly concerned about keeping the animals' bloodlines pure while not 
inbreeding them. Virtually all the Vietnamese potbellies in the United States 
are descended from a group of 18 brought in through Canada in 1983 by Keith 
Connell. 
</P>
<P>
There are several pig registries nationwide that certify how closely related 
the animals are to the original group. But Bryant says some breeders -- anxious 
to cash in on the growing market -- cross their Vietnamese potbellies with 
other strains. The resulting pigs are not as small or good-tempered or healthy 
as the real thing, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant got interested in the pint-sized pigs by accident; she had been trying 
to get a skunk to keep her cat company and applied for several exotic animal 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I got all the permits, I was on mailing lists and I started getting ads 
for zebras and giraffes and things," she said in a recent interview. "I just 
was watching the pigs in those trade magazines. And I really liked the idea 
because, well, pigs just make really great pets but they're also a pet that 
anybody can have. Most of the pets that are unusual you can't have unless you 
have a farm. The pigs you can have in an apartment." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant speaks from experience. Until recently, she had been breeding pigs in a 
two-bedroom condo in suburban Rockville, and at one point had 23 of them. But 
she and her husband, Jeb, are moving to Durango, Colo., where they will raise 
pigs and other exotic animals on a farm. Their breeding pigs are already there. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Bryants and Sparky are sharing quarters with a ferret, a 
tabby cat, a tank of goldfish in the house and, oddly, a bathtub filled with 
more fish outside on the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
During a visit, 4-month-old Sparky trundled around the living room and grunted 
softly before hopping on the couch to snuggle up. He weighs about 15 pounds and 
feels like a bristly, wiggly football with a warm, rubbery snout. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant can't say enough good about her pigs, but she confessed that they have 
two weaknesses: food and telephones. 
</P>
<P>
Pigs will overeat, so Bryant recommends a strict diet of mini pig chow. They 
also like treats like peanuts, raisins and fruits. 
</P>
<P>
As for the telephone, Bryant said: "They like to knock it off the hook and push 
the buttons. It's cute but it's annoying." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant has a U.S. Department of Agriculture permit to breed the pigs but she 
said no special permission was needed in Montgomery County to keep them as 
pets. However, some localities classify all pigs as livestock, so it's 
important for would-be owners to make sure that they can keep pigs as pets.

WORKING PARENTS AND EMPLOYERS WRESTLE WITH THE CHILD-CARE DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK GLADSTONE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barbara Jackle and her husband think they're lucky. They found a reliable woman 
to watch their 5-year-old son for $85 a week, even though that required getting 
special permission to enroll him in a school near the care-giver's home 3 miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's good for only one year," said Barbara Jackle, 37, a librarian who 
lives in Upper Darby, Pa., near Philadelphia. "We're even contemplating moving, 
so we could be closer to where she is." 
</P>
<P>
The Jackles' scramble to find a trustworthy sitter for their 5-year-old is a 
product of the growth in two-income families among the baby-boom generation. 
That, in turn, has created an enormous problem for working parents nationwide: 
who baby-sits, and how to pay the sitter? 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, it seems if you're going to need care you'd better get set up before 
you get pregnant," said Louise Hurst, a licensed day-care professional who 
watches the Jackle boy and five other young children in her home. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten lots of calls," said Hurst, 43. "I inform them I'm full until 
September, 1991, so I don't even bother to take a waiting list." 
</P>
<P>
Demand for child care has grown so fast that costs have multiplied, in some 
cases nearly consuming the money earned from a second income. This has crimped 
budgets of millions of Americans and created an underground cash economy of 
unregulated care-givers. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, American women have been the family care-givers. But the nation's 
labor pool is becoming increasingly female. A Labor Department study by the 
Hudson Institute, an Indianapolis research organization, says women make up 
almost half the work force, compared with 38.1% in 1970 and 29.6% in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Other Labor Department figures say 57% of all women with children under 6 work 
outside the home, compared with 12% in 1950. The Children's Defense Fund, a 
Washington-based child-advocacy group, predicts that by 1995, two-thirds of all 
preschool children will have working mothers, an increase of 50% in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Only 7% of American households now fit the Beaver Cleaver family's mold of 
breadwinning father and at-home mother," says a policy paper by the Child Care 
Action Campaign, a New York coalition that advocates a national system of care. 
"As female labor force participation rates continue to climb, the demand for 
child care will grow, too." 
</P>
<P>
Many companies, striving to attract or retain valued employees, offer 
incentives ranging from flexible work schedules to emergency sitters. Some have 
gone further, allowing young parents to work at home or take years off with 
full benefits and job guarantees. Others are building in-house day-care 
centers, hiring roving nannies or subsidizing the cost of care with cash. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly it's fashionable these days for corporations to get into this," said 
Antony Ward, director of Child Care Inc., a New York referral service many 
companies retain to help employees find sitters. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people viscerally respond to the child-care issue," he said. "Anyone 
who takes the kid to the family day-care provider to find a note on the door 
saying, 'I have the flu,' knows what it's like." 
</P>
<P>
First Bank System of St. Paul, Minn., for example, this year donated space in 
its office building for a public kindergarten that doubles as an after-school 
day-care center, with priority given to children of bank employees. NCNB Corp., 
a fast-growing bank in Charlotte, N.C., plans to offer many of its workers a 
child-care reimbursement of up to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Pitney Bowes Inc., a leading maker of business machines in Stamford, Conn., 
helped pioneer flexible working hours to accommodate working parents, allowing 
them to arrive early some days, leave early on others. Federal Express Corp., 
the Memphis, Tenn., overnight delivery service, offers working parents four-day 
weeks and 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shifts. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, seven large New York-based employers, hoping to cut absenteeism, 
announced a pilot program to provide emergency sitters for workers whose usual 
arrangements are disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies are finding that if they're not family friendly, they're losing 
employees," said Lorraine Dusky, a free-lance writer and co-author of "The Best 
Companies for Women," a guidebook to 50 American corporations. "Companies 
aren't doing this to be altruistic. If companies don't do something, we're in 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Child-care activists say, however, that the high-profile benefits of a few 
companies mask a potential labor crisis. Most businesses say child care is not 
a work-related issue, despite evidence that help from the boss lowers turnover, 
raises morale and improves productivity. Moreover, the activists say, the 
federal government is not providing much help. 
</P>
<P>
Although a bill that would vastly expand federal support for child care is 
working through Congress, it faces a likely White House veto because of the 
estimated $22.7-billion cost over five years. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush proposes more modest legislation that would cost $2.5 billion a 
year by 1993, mostly through tax credits to parents. Still, that is less than 
$20 a week or about $1,000 a year, and it would go only to poorer families. 
</P>
<P>
Actual costs for out-of-home child care range from $1,500 to $10,000 a year, 
according to a study by the Conference Board, a New York-based business 
research group. Other studies show much higher costs for in-home care. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the costs and the scarcity of day-care openings, the vast majority 
of working parents contend with a hodgepodge, hit-or-miss system for finding 
help they can trust and afford. Stories abound of sitters who ignore, abandon, 
abuse or kidnap children. 
</P>
<P>
Most parents rely on referrals from friends and relatives, but the result can 
be hiring an unlicensed, untrained care-giver. An additional aggravation is 
that these care-givers generally take only cash to avoid paying income tax. An 
estimated $7 billion in day-care income goes unreported annually. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, parents must give the Internal Revenue Service the name 
and Social Security number of their day-care provider to qualify for a tax 
credit to defray child-care costs. The IRS plans to cross-reference the returns 
of sitters and prosecute cheaters. 
</P>
<P>
Day-care experts believe the law could make it even harder for parents to 
afford day care, since many providers will raise rates to compensate for taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"Child-care workers are the lowest paid workers in this country. One of the 
ways people are able to survive is to be paid without having to declare the 
income," said Barbara Reisman, executive director of the Child Care Action 
Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't recommend people cheat on their taxes," she said. "But many parents 
can't afford to pay the full cost of care." 
</P>
<P>
Esther J. Kahn, director of Parent's Place, a San Francisco counseling and 
referral service, agrees. "We have a system that has not caught up with rapid 
social change in our society, in which more women are back in the labor force 
and need child care. Our society hasn't provided support for families," Kahn 
said.

WORKING MOTHERS PUT NANNIES IN GREAT DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK GLADSTONE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chances are growing that those young women pushing strollers in the supermarket 
or nudging toddlers into the playground sandbox are modern incarnations of that 
prim English nursemaid, the nanny. 
</P>
<P>
The increasing number of working American mothers has created a strong demand 
for child care. For couples who can afford it, trained nannies are a popular 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"In-home child care is obviously not the cheapest way to go, but if you 
consider your child to be the most important factor in your life, then don't 
have a Volvo, buy a Chevrolet," said Cathie Robertson, president of the 
International Nanny Assn., a professional group based in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Seriously, a lot of people have a Mercedes and won't spend more than $85 a 
week to take care of their children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the location, nannies can earn $200 to $500 a week, plus room and 
board. They typically work 12-hour days, doing everything from changing diapers 
to buying infant formula to reading bedtime stories. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not there to schlep the dog around to the vet or scrub out toilets," 
Robertson said. "They're there for the kids. That's probably been the hardest 
thing we've had to do to teach parents." 
</P>
<P>
Interest in hiring nannies has grown so rapidly that schools now train recruits 
in this country, mostly women in their 20s who want to make children part of 
their careers. Courses range from child nutrition to family relations. 
</P>
<P>
Terri Eurich, president of the National Academy of Nannies in Denver, says her 
school has graduated dozens of nannies since she founded it in 1983. Students 
get nearly five months of training for $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
Eurich pats her school on the back for helping advance nannying as a legitimate 
profession and says most of her graduates quickly find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing our best to create an appreciation of a valuable service," she 
said. "Just because they're not typing into a word processor doesn't mean they 
shouldn't be paid $1,200 to $1,500 a month." 
</P>
<P>
One recent graduate, 21-year-old Paige Pessarra, cares for the 11-month-old son 
of Mr. and Mrs. Stephen McLaughlin in Ladue, Mo., outside St. Louis; McLaughlin 
is a businessman, his wife a full-time medical student. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided I wanted to start with an infant and nurture him," said Pessarra, 
who had read about the nanny profession in Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
She said she works 60 hours a week, has her own bedroom and living room, and 
gets to use the family four-wheel-drive vehicle with mobile phone for 
emergencies. She declined to discuss her salary. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally I'm happy with what I'm getting," she said. "I get a lot of 
benefits and extras. I look at my job as a profession. I'm planning on staying 
a number of years."

EX-BIKER NOW SPENDS DAYS AS 'MADISON'S SANTA CLAUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MADISON, Wis. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Sudduth's life started off bad and got worse, but the pudgy, 
white-bearded, balding man said that without those experiences he couldn't do 
what he does best -- be Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
Sudduth was an abused child and spent time in an outlaw motorcycle gang before 
a stint in the Marines and marriage helped turn his life around. He has spent 
the last 14 years as "Madison's Santa Claus," refurbishing and distributing 
toys to needy children. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids let me into their lives every day," he said. "They can relate to me. 
I know what they're going through. I have not been Mr. Lily White, but every 
bit of it gave me a deep knowledge of children I'll never forget." 
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Sudduth, who also works as an apartment manager, works 
year-round with a group of volunteer elves to collect and repair old toys in 
his workshop and distribute them to needy children. 
</P>
<P>
Although he never stops being Santa, the holidays -- obviously -- are his 
busiest time of year. 
</P>
<P>
"When Christmas comes, I lose track of everything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Sudduth, who doesn't need pillows or a false beard to look like Santa, said 
this Christmas holds special meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just thankful to be alive," he said, his eyes squinting and his red, round 
cheeks jiggling with each giggle. "And I'm thankful for all these fantastic 
people in this town. They blew me away when I was in the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Sudduth suffered a brain aneurysm in November, 1988, that required surgery and 
left him in the hospital for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
When residents discovered that Sudduth did not have health insurance they 
started a "Get Well Santa" fund and raised more than $41,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The people came through for someone in need, just like he does every day for 
people in need," said Don Dahnke, owner of Don's Hallmark, who donated space 
for Santa's workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Dahnke said his suppliers of toys, stuffed animals and candy used to think he 
was joking when he told them about Sudduth and asked for donations, but "they 
don't think it's a joke anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Sudduth's network of thousands of volunteers reaches across Wisconsin and 
throughout the nation, but even if he had no help, he would still be giving, 
friends said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he's gone down to $2 in his checkbook to make sure people would have a 
Christmas dinner," Dahnke said. 
</P>
<P>
Sudduth refuses to accept money for being Santa, saying "you can't give to 
those who give." 
</P>
<P>
He used to hang uncashed checks on his walls and he has a frame of them in his 
crowded workshop, including a blank one made out to "Mr. S. Claus." 
</P>
<P>
Sudduth's wife, Kathy, has long, wavy hair parted in the middle, wears round, 
metal-framed glasses and is often called "Mrs. Claus." Mr. Claus says she 
turned his life around. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Sudduth did not choose his first Santa assignment 32 years ago; he 
was drafted. He was a Marine staff sergeant and was pulled out of his barracks 
to play Santa "because they needed someone fat." 
</P>
<P>
These days, it's a labor of love. Sudduth drives a 1972 Dodge with a 
holiday-style paint job and hugs everyone he meets -- something he hasn't 
always done. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a very abused child," he said, with his usually jolly voice turning 
solemn. "I equated that violence with love, and I thought I was spreading that 
love with violence." 
</P>
<P>
Sudduth, whose mother died of cancer when he was 14, said he spent time in 
California as the president of a motorcycle gang before moving to the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
"I went there looking for brotherhood and love," he said. "But it wasn't there. 
It's not anywhere but in your heart. I didn't know that then, but I do now."

TINY TURTLE MAY HOLD UP RAILWAY PLANS

<P>
Conrail's plan to park its cars in protected wetlands may be derailed by the 
yellow-spotted turtle. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-inch-wide reptile was once the most common turtle in Massachusetts. Now 
the state considers it a species of "special concern." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say that seasonal pools favored by the turtle could be 
damaged if Philadelphia-based Consolidated Rail Corp. goes ahead with a plan to 
expand its 1,000-car terminal to 2,600 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
The arguments evoke the dispute in the 1970s over the snail darter, a species 
of tiny fish whose protectors held up construction of a Tennessee dam for a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
To soothe concerned residents of this Boston suburb and state 
environmentalists, Conrail has hired two zoologists to study the spotted 
turtle. They are to draft a plan for moving the turtles to a suitable new 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a legitimate concern about the environment in this country," said 
Bruce Wilson, a senior vice president for legal affairs at Conrail. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in the need to balance our concerns for preserving the environment 
with the commercial demands that result from man himself being a domesticated 
animal," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The spotted turtle is far better off than the snail darter, which was 
threatened with extinction. 
</P>
<P>
A species of "special concern" in Massachusetts is two notches above those 
considered "endangered." Species of special concern are declining in numbers 
and may disappear from the state, said Tom French, assistant director of the 
state Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program. 
</P>
<P>
Conrail's plan for the turtles must pass muster with French's office. If the 
research and plan are satisfactory, the next step will be to draft an 
environmental-impact report, then to obtain permits for the project from the 
state Department of Environmental Protection and the Army Corps of Engineers.

GOOD RURAL HEALTH CARE CALLED POSSIBLE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: A REPORT RECOMMENDS THAT TOWNS USE CREATIVE APPROACHES SUCH AS NURSE 
PRACTITIONERS AND MODERN EMERGENCY SERVICES TO MAKE UP FOR SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS.

<P>
Rural advocates for years have urged more attention for the medical needs of 
sparsely settled areas, the small towns and farms where a fourth of America's 
people live. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study done for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Assn. says 
improved health care insurance would help as much as anything, ranking with 
jobs, water and sewer systems. 
</P>
<P>
The association, a lobbying force on Capitol Hill, is a major backer of 
comprehensive rural development legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Rural development is also the concern of a number of congressional leaders, 
including Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee, who says: "We cannot have two Americas -- one a land of opportunity 
and a second, rural America, left behind." 
</P>
<P>
Leahy said rural areas, with an estimated 61 million people and 14,000 small 
towns and cities, are in trouble because of higher unemployment and poverty 
rates than in metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
The problems of rural health care seem obvious to the casual observer -- there 
are simply not enough doctors and hospitals in the countryside. A sick or 
injured person in the big city has a much better chance of getting quick 
treatment than a farmer in the middle of a pasture in Kansas or Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
But some believe that there is a more promising side to this dark coin and that 
there are solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost all rural hospitals are losing money as a result of dramatic declines 
in use, changes in government funding and fewer local doctors," an Agriculture 
Department report said. "But that does not mean that rural residents must forgo 
local medical care." 
</P>
<P>
Rural areas can have a strong base for local health care, given some creativity 
and persistence, the report said. There are alternatives to hospitalization and 
sometimes to doctors themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Most patients no longer need a bed in a hospital," the report said. "And 
modern emergency care techniques can stabilize patients for transport to a more 
distant hospital. Physician assistants and nurse practitioners can help ease 
the workload of the local physicians." 
</P>
<P>
The report, "Rural America and the Revolution in Health Care," was written by 
Jeffrey C. Bauer, a former professor at the University of Colorado Medical 
Center and now head of his own rural health consulting firm. Co-author Eileen 
Weis, a registered nurse, is a strategic planner with the same firm, the Bauer 
Group of Hillrose, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
"Rural areas today have too few physicians," the report said. "Some areas have 
none. Unlike their city-based colleagues, many rural physicians are the only 
doctor in town, bearing all the burdens of being on call every evening and 
every weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it said, disproportionately large numbers of government-insured or 
uninsured patients live in rural areas, and that means lower income for 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with career burnout and lower pay, many head for the cities and more 
lucrative fields. Hospitals built 30 or 40 years ago have vacancies galore. 
</P>
<P>
"Most small and rural hospitals today fill less than 30% of their beds; 80% 
occupancy levels were common just 10 years ago," the report said. "However, 
rural communities should not assume that their hospitals' problems will all be 
solved if more doctors move into town or if hospital reimbursement rates are 
equalized." 
</P>
<P>
One of the basic alternatives has been the development of primary medical care 
without putting patients in a hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
"Up-to-date primary care practitioners can meet 80% to 90% of all health care 
needs without acute care hospital beds," the report said. "Technological 
advances now enable primary care specialists to provide advanced diagnostic 
capabilities in their offices or clinics." 
</P>
<P>
Nurse practitioners and doctor assistants can perform many primary care 
functions with varying degrees of supervision by physicians. 
</P>
<P>
The report said emergency medical services provide the other key to the future 
of rural health. 
</P>
<P>
Because of recent scientific and technological advances, a modern emergency 
system "can actually be better than a typical emergency room in a rural 
hospital," the report said. With a trained crew working with a fully equipped 
modern ambulance, most critically ill or injured patients can be stabilized at 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"Thus, saving a small, rural hospital to preserve emergency care is not 
necessarily the best way to keep emergency care in rural areas," the report 
said. "In many smaller towns, money spent toward emergency medical care is 
better spent on upgraded" emergency medical services. 
</P>
<P>
But talk of closing hospitals can strike nerves, as Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) 
demonstrated recently during a Veterans Affairs Committee hearing. Washington 
policy makers are fundamentally oblivious to the needs of rural America, he 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
"They really don't understand the sense of space and distance" in rural areas, 
Baucus said. The discussion at the time involved the possibility of closing 
rural veterans hospitals in Montana, a move ruled out at the hearing by 
Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski. 
</P>
<P>
The National Rural Electric Cooperative Assn. says expanded medical insurance 
coverage heads its list of ways to improve rural health care. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Bergland, vice president and general manager of the association, said: "We 
want to make sure that the needs of rural Americans are considered in the 
current debate on medical insurance coverage and other health care problems." 
</P>
<P>
Bergland, who was secretary of agriculture in the Jimmy Carter Administration, 
said rural residents are less likely than city people to benefit from tax 
incentives and other programs aimed at making health care more available and 
affordable. 
</P>
<P>
But he said: "Doctors and nurses will be the first to tell you that it's not 
just their numbers that are important for good rural health care. We've got to 
assure things like adequate water and sewer facilities, nutrition education and 
preventive health care."

The State Department expressed concern Friday about the possibility that Middle 
Eastern terrorists may be planning a variety of attacks, perhaps against U.S. 
targets in Western Europe or West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
A brief statement said the concern was based partly on recent reports of 
movement of terrorists from the Middle East and the discovery of weapons 
shipments destined for pro-Iranian groups in Spain and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"If credible, specific information or a threat to the public is received, the 
Department of State will provide additional information for travelers and other 
concerned parties," the statement said.

CONGO 'GLASNOST' FLOURISHES AS MARXIST STATE MOVES COMPETITIVELY RIGHT 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While glasnost blooms in Eastern Europe the superpowers are waging a cordial 
contest of cultural centers in Congo, a Marxist state whose leader's ideas 
sound more and more like those of a Western conservative. 
</P>
<P>
The opening salvo came from the United States. Last month in a renovated 
three-story bank it opened a gleaming center housing a library, offices and 
language-training facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Every day in quiet Brazzaville, capital of French-speaking Congo, the Center 
Culturel Americain packs people in for live satellite transmissions of American 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"Marxism has practically nothing to teach us," said Roland, 27, watching a 
wide-screen broadcast and struggling to understand an encounter between Dan 
Rather and Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets give us a lot of books to read, but people can't eat books," said 
Roland, who hopes English lessons will land him a job. 
</P>
<P>
Across the city's main commercial street, Soviet cultural attache Oleg 
Prokopenko admitted that his center, housed in a cavernous old bank that still 
looks like a bank, had nothing to compete with the American multiscreen 
television array. 
</P>
<P>
But Prokopenko said he, too, wanted to build a new cultural center and hoped to 
have full-time satellite transmission of Soviet television soon. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime he boasts of Africa's only branch of the Pushkin Institute for 
Russian-language training and described relations with the Americans as a 
"friendly rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed in Congo, a country of two million people that was the 
administrative center of French Equatorial Africa before independence and 
afterwards became one of Africa's Marxist strongholds. 
</P>
<P>
Under former President Marien Ngouabi, assassinated in 1977 but still the 
country's ideological mentor, Congo developed a mixed economy of state and 
private enterprise and followed a pro-Soviet line in foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s and early 1900s Soviet technical advisers held sway in the 
Congolese army. Cuban troops on their way to Angola frolicked in Pointe Noire, 
an oil port. The United States and Britain closed their embassies. 
</P>
<P>
But the great red tide that some Europeans and Americans feared would sweep 
post-colonial Africa has receded. 
</P>
<P>
Today Congo has military advisers from France, far and away Congo's biggest 
trading partner and aid donor. 
</P>
<P>
The country's key oil fields are run by French, Italian, British and American 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubans are leaving Angola and are all but gone from Pointe Noire. The 
British and U.S. embassies have long since reopened and France, which 
maintained close ties to Congo even at the height of Marxist fervor, is keeping 
up with the superpowers by building its own new cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and other analysts attribute most of the change to President Denis 
Sassou-Nguesso, 46, a colonel who took charge in 1979 from an interim 
administration formed after Ngouabi's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
"Sassou-Nguesso officially is a Marxist because that helps keep things in 
line," one Western diplomat said. "But what he has done is put around him 
technocrats with no ideological interest." 
</P>
<P>
In October, Sassou-Nguesso outlined a five-year economic plan that owed more to 
conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher than to Karl Marx. 
</P>
<P>
The president, who sometimes wears tailored military fatigues on state 
occasions, endorsed economic reform programs of the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund, saying Congo needed "Draconian" measures. 
</P>
<P>
He berated civil servants for absenteeism and laziness. He said the bloated 
bureaucracy would be pruned and warned graduates they could no longer count on 
a government pay check. 
</P>
<P>
He said loss-making state firms would be closed or sold and private enterprise 
promoted, a decision certain to please international lenders and donors anxious 
about Congo's ability to repay its estimated $4-billion foreign debt, among the 
highest per capita in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"The private sector . . . especially in rural development will be encouraged by 
a series of measures to cut through government red tape and protect it from 
unfair competition," Sassou-Nguesso said. 
</P>
<P>
He was true to his word. Less than a month later Congo said it would sell off 
the money-losing distribution arm of the national oil company Hydro-Congo. 
</P>
<P>
However, Congo will retain the company's profitable research and exploration 
divisions in charge of developing substantial offshore reserves that make Congo 
black Africa's fifth biggest oil producer. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue from oil, its main export, has fallen 80% in four years, leaving the 
country saddled with debts for projects begun when oil prices were double 
current levels.

SILVANA MANGANO; ITALIAN MOVIE ACTRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Silvana Mangano, an Italian screen beauty and former wife of producer Dino De 
Laurentiis, died Saturday in a Madrid hospital of cancer. She was 59. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano had been in a coma for several days after surgery, a hospital spokesman 
said. Three daughters from her marriage to De Laurentiis -- Francesca, Veronica 
and Raffaela -- were at the hospital when she died. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano was perhaps best known for her role as a sensual country girl in 
director Giuseppe De Santis' 1949 film "Bitter Rice," a film about peasant 
girls working in the rice fields of northern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
She emerged as a dark, sensuous star in the post-war era that also saw the rise 
of such world-famed Italian beauties as Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida. 
Throughout her film career, Mangano was often overshadowed by the two 
better-known actresses. 
</P>
<P>
Her career was also eclipsed in later years by the fame of De Laurentiis, her 
husband for 34 years. She separated from De Laurentiis in 1983 and filed for 
divorce last year. 
</P>
<P>
Mangano was born April 21, 1930, in Rome, the daughter of a Sicilian railroad 
worker and an English mother. 
</P>
<P>
She began her film career in 1947 at the age of 16 after being selected Miss 
Rome in a beauty contest. 
</P>
<P>
In 1949, she became an international star with her role in "Bitter Rice." 
</P>
<P>
Although she attained stardom, Mangano was never completely comfortable in her 
role as a screen beauty. She said once: "I never liked myself, neither when I 
was a roundish girl, nor when I became a slender woman." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1947, Mangano made 34 films, most of which had little success outside 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, her son Federico, 26, a budding film director, was killed in a plane 
crash in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
After that, she withdrew from public view, although she emerged in 1983 to play 
the Reverend Mother in David Lynch's science fiction epic "Dune."

PRESENTER'S MONEY WOES KEEP ARTS GROUPS AWAY 
</P>

<P>
The reason San Diego arts patrons cannot see the San Francisco Ballet present 
"The Nutracker" this holiday season, local musicians contend, is that Suzanne 
Townsend and her San Diego Performances' ambitious plans have cost performers 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend, head of the debt-ridden company that specializes in importing dance 
companies, shocked the Musicians Assn., Local 325 in May when she failed to pay 
an entire orchestra -- 58 musicians -- who played during a five-day run of the 
Joffrey Ballet. According to union officials and the contractor who hired the 
orchestra, Townsend owes the musicians about $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Performances, the largest dance presenter in San Diego, is operating 
with a $450,000 deficit. Insiders in the local arts community said that 
Townsend also owes thousands of dollars to the San Francisco Ballet, the 
American Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet and the Eliot Feld and Alvin Ailey dance 
companies in New York, as well as local stagehands. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bowers, a member of the San Diego Performances board of directors, said he 
did not know how much is owed to dance troupes, but acknowledged that poor 
ticket sales have hurt the company and hampered its ability to pay musicians 
and performers. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that our ticket sales projections for the Joffrey Ballet and Alvin 
Ailey were not realized, and this presented a problem. It's tough when you have 
to rely heavily on ticket sales to make money from a performance," Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
At a September press conference at which she announced her nonprofit company's 
fall and winter season, Townsend acknowledged the huge deficit, but said she 
would be working with a $1-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Moffatt, general manager of the San Francisco Ballet, said Townsend still 
owes her company $60,000 from last year's San Diego performances of "The 
Nutcracker" and "Swan Lake." 
</P>
<P>
"Townsend told us that she just doesn't have the money," Moffatt said. "We had 
an agreement with her to do 'The Nutcracker' again this year, but we had to 
cancel because we haven't been paid for last year's performances. I'm very 
sorry about having to cancel. We had two successful seasons in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Although the San Francisco Ballet canceled its performance, the California 
Ballet is performing its version of the ballet at the Civic Theatre and is its 
own presenter. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if Moffatt's company had agreed to perform again this year, Townsend 
would have had a hard time finding a live orchestra for the performance. Union 
musicians say they won't play for San Diego Performances until she pays the 
money owed them for their work on the Joffrey Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
"She told us after the Joffrey Ballet that she was trying to collect some money 
to pay us. But it's been several months now, and we still haven't been paid," 
said Joe Pallazola, Local 325 president. "It's in the hands of our attorney 
now. She won't be able to use any union musicians until we get paid." 
</P>
<P>
Before Moffatt announced that her company was canceling its San Diego 
appearance, Townsend asked the San Diego Symphony if she could use its 
musicians to complement the San Francisco Ballet. Symphony spokesman Tim 
Mitrovich said management agreed to make the musicians available only if she 
produced a letter of credit or provided the money up front to pay them. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't do either, so we had to decline," Mitrovich said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the symphony will make the same requirements for any future 
performances for Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend, 45, failed to return repeated phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and critics alike described Townsend as an ambitious, egotistical 
promoter of dance whose ardent goal is to bring world-class productions to San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Merriman, who plays French horn and who says he is owed $745 by Townsend, 
praised her for working hard to bring top dance companies to San Diego but 
criticized her ethics. 
</P>
<P>
"Top dance companies don't come here on their own volition. Somebody has to set 
things up at this end. . . . She's obviously trying to fill this role, and I 
commend her for it," Merriman said. "But I don't agree with her philosophy of 
making plans to import these companies without first making sure that she can 
pay the musicians and her other debts." 
</P>
<P>
Before founding her company three years ago, Townsend worked at the San Diego 
Foundaton for the Performing Arts. Foundation spokesman Fred Colby said they 
parted ways after foundation members and Townsend disagreed over her plans for 
bringing first-class dance companies to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we didn't want these companies," Colby said. "But Suzanne was 
too ambitious. She wanted to move too fast for the budget we had to work with. 
That's why she's in trouble now. She is just too ambitious. She tried to do too 
much too soon, and it got to be very expensive for her." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation is Townsend's main competitor in bringing major dance companies 
to San Diego. However, the foundation, with its $850,000 operating budget, is 
still smaller than San Diego Performances. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Performances board member Bowers said it is unfair to single Townsend 
out for the company's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all in this together," Bowers said. "The board and Suzanne together bit 
off more than we should have. Perhaps we tried to have too lofty a season the 
first two years. Perhaps we should have been more conservative and not brought 
in so many major companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We did have too expansive a season and certainly should have gone at it more 
slowly. But it's not just Suzanne's fault." 
</P>
<P>
Musicians who are owed money by Townsend take a less kindly view. 
</P>
<P>
"She has such a flagrant disregard for the system," Merriman said. "You wonder 
at what point during the Joffrey performance she noticed that she would not be 
able to make payroll but let it go its full course and then walked away from 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand how a person can hire labor and then not pay for it. How 
can she get away with it? The fact that she's still putting on performances 
amazes me," said Renata Bratt, a cellist who said she is owed $500 by Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend recently brought the Paul Taylor Dance Group and Ballet Folklorico de 
Mexico to town, and she has the Dance Theatre of Harlem lined up for several 
performances next month. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers said Townsend is bothered by her alienation from the musicians union and 
the local arts community as a result of the company's financial problems. But 
he denied that Townsend has burned many bridges in the musical world. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a trouper and presenter of many years, and an experienced arts 
executive," Bowers said. "She has been able to live with this because she 
understands what has happened. It's difficult when these people are your 
friends. She's dealing with company managers, symphony executives and musicians 
who are friends of hers. I know it's not easy for her." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Townsend settles the pay dispute with the musicians, their 
disagreements with her are sure to continue. Like other presenters in San Diego 
and throughout the country, Townsend uses taped music with many of her shows. 
Performances put on by the Paul Taylor Dance Group, Ballet Folklorico and Dance 
Theatre of Harlem all feature taped music instead of a live orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The musicians have been picketing shows that use this type of music. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that's snowballing. Musicians record the show, get paid once 
for recording and don't get any more money. When people go to a ballet, they 
like to see a live orchestra. They like to see a conductor," said Pallazola, 
president of the local musicians union. "But our work is diminishing because of 
the increased use of canned music." 
</P>
<P>
Bratt said the public is "getting cheated" two ways by the use of taped music. 
</P>
<P>
"The presenter doesn't reduce ticket prices when he uses taped music, and the 
production value of the show is usually not very good," Bratt said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pallazola, during a performance by a Russian dance group during 
the Soviet arts festival, foreign voices and coughing could be heard on the 
tape.

MORE EDUCATIONAL BANG FOR THE BUCK IN LA JOLLA?; 
</P>
<P>
LEARNING: PARENTS IN THIS AFFLUENT SEASIDE COMMUNITY KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON CITY 
SCHOOLS. IF DISSATISFIED WITH THEIR CHILDRENS' EDUCATION, THEY CAN AFFORD TO 
PLACE THEIR OFFSPRING IN A PRIVATE ACADEMY.

<P>
By next September, Dennis Doyle would like to lure back to Torrey Pines 
Elementary School at least 20 students whose parents have spurned public 
education for private academies in the La Jolla area. 
</P>
<P>
The new principal has set that goal -- 5% of the school's enrollment of 372 -- 
as a key management objective on which he expects to be evaluated next year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's healthy for schools to compete in the open, in the public arena, 
especially since (in La Jolla) many parents have knowledge of and access to 
'choice' with private schools," said Doyle. He plans to distribute a slick 
brochure extolling the academic and multi-ethnic benefits of Torrey Pines and 
to proselytize at neighborhood service clubs and preschools. 
</P>
<P>
In seaside La Jolla, among the county's most affluent areas with average family 
income of $77,000, parents demand high-powered public education and closely 
monitor the public schools for acceptable results. Many can and will turn to 
one of more than half a dozen private schools -- even at tuition costs ranging 
upwards from $5,000 a year -- if dissatisfied for any reason about the 
individual instruction being provided their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
For example, at La Jolla High School several years ago, two parents angry at 
their childrens' history instructor took the extreme measure of writing 
alternative lesson plans themselves and giving them to the teacher. The teacher 
later resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Other parents upset with the public system have simply gone private for one 
child and, after seeing good results, placed their other children privately as 
well. Some move their children back and forth between public and private. 
</P>
<P>
In handling such pressures, teachers and principals at La Jolla's five public 
schools must grapple more intensely with key urban educational issues, unlike 
colleagues in typical well-to-do cities. Unlike most upscale, white suburban 
areas, their schools are part of a large urban district -- San Diego Unified, 
the nation's eighth largest -- and therefore share the challenges of 
integration and equity in a system where only 41% of the 119,000 students are 
white. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred low-income students from the San Diego barrio are bused to La 
Jolla schools each day under district voluntary integration programs, bringing 
together student populations with widely varying cultural and academic levels. 
</P>
<P>
More than a quarter of the students in La Jolla public schools, ranging from 
35% at Muirlands Junior High to 20% at Bird Rock Elementary, are Latino, many 
of them primary Spanish speakers. Without those students, more La Jolla public 
schools might be forced to close in the face of declining enrollments. Low 
student numbers already shut down two elementaries in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The mix requires educators to accomplish two seemingly incompatible goals: show 
apprehensive neighborhood parents that the multi-ethnic mix does not dilute 
academic rigor and satisfy the larger San Diego community -- and the courts -- 
that classes are integrated and that bused children receive just as good an 
education. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures differ at each educational level, with the hardest battle fought 
by those at Muirlands, where teachers have to juggle not only parent 
perceptions concerning academic standards but also doubts about trusting the 
public school to cope with the perils of adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla High School, with its long tradition of strong principals and 
teachers, and an impressive track record of sending its graduates to top 
universities nationwide, has perhaps the best reputation among parents in 
matching the offerings at The Bishop's School, the highly respected private 
secondary school in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to improve the overall public school curriculum -- especially at 
the junior high level -- and to relieve some crowding at the small Bird Rock 
campus, all La Jolla sixth-graders will go to Muirlands next September, making 
it a 6-through-8 middle school with La Jolla High becoming a 9-12 school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's trickiest to implement (district goals) in La Jolla, where academics is 
pushed so hard, and where parents, rightly or wrongly, look at academic 
progress more than student socialization or their handling of (cultural) 
diversity," said San Diego city schools trustee Kay Davis, who has closely 
watched changes in La Jolla during her almost eight years on the school board. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, La Jolla parents value and track closely the GATE (Gifted and 
Talented Education) program, which offers special instruction and opportunities 
for exceptional students. Almost a third of La Jolla students are eligible for 
some aspect of GATE offerings and parents grumble when lack of space in the 
program or the requirements of ethnic balance limit GATE participation. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego schools Supt. Tom Payzant said in an interview that what is played 
out daily in La Jolla educational circles reflects "the challenge of working 
simultaneously toward two goals -- equity and excellence -- in an atmosphere 
where some people believe the two are incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can offer high-quality academic programs, then students don't have to go 
elsewhere for strong math and science, or for advanced placement courses, or 
whatever," Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant wants his schools strengthened to the point where parents will have no 
compelling reasons academically to choose private schools, and will do so only 
if they "do not want a setting with large class sizes or diverse populations." 
</P>
<P>
Private schools emphasize the ability to offer strong academics along with 
small class sizes in a controlled environment but avoid criticizing the public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Every private, or independent school, emphasizes what it believes to be its 
mission, rather than seeing itself in" direct competition with public schools, 
Timothy Burns, headmaster at La Jolla Country Day School, said. 
</P>
<P>
Burns acknowledged that recruitment in La Jolla is easier when confidence in 
public schools is low, although none of the La Jolla-area private schools is 
having problems attracting students, and most have extensive waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,300 students in kindergarten-through-12 attend La Jolla public schools; 
an estimated 1,700 are enrolled in the area's various private schools, with 60% 
to 70% of those from the La Jolla area. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line for our family has been the small class size, the intimacy and 
the closeness possible, both with faculty and other parents," said Karen 
Michelson, who with her husband Joseph placed their three children at La Jolla 
Country Day. "We find that each (child) has been able not only to get strong 
skills development but also to experiment with activities, to use the school 
differently." 
</P>
<P>
The Michelsons put their first child in private school after moving to the area 
in the mid-1970s from Davis, Calif. At that time, many La Jolla parents were 
upset at the possibility that district integration plans would force La Jolla 
students to be bused to Southeast San Diego. That never materialized, but the 
Michelsons nonetheless decided to go with private schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so pleased with private schools that it has just seemed logical to 
stay with Country Day," Michelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Nellis has his oldest son at The Bishop's School, which he said provides 
"intangibles beyond just great academics, individual attention and small class 
size" for high-achieving students. 
</P>
<P>
Students have a chance to try athletics or other extra-curricular activities in 
a small setting, and they also are required to perform community service, 
things not always possible at a public school, Nellis said. 
</P>
<P>
But principals at La Jolla-area public schools, along with many parents, say 
their campuses increasingly display strong assets in competing with the siren 
songs of private schools. 
</P>
<P>
At Torrey Pines Elementary, Doyle runs down the list of benefits for children 
at the school: before-school classes in French, Spanish, art and computers; 
after-school programs by the YMCA; the city schools' only full-time elementary 
librarian; teacher aides and a large cadre of trained parent volunteers in each 
class to minimize teacher-student ratios; agreements with nearby UC San Diego 
to tap campus specialists for lectures and field trips; an idyllic setting on a 
cul-de-sac overlooking the Pacific and interaction between white and Latino 
children reflecting the real-world future for California residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents at Torrey Pines have worked hard to make sure there are both the 
basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic and a lot of enrichment as well," 
said Gordon Dunfee, a board member of the Friends of Torrey Pines Foundation. 
The foundation, a private group with counterparts at all La Jolla schools, 
raises money to buy computers, books and other items the school district cannot 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
An upbeat view at Torrey Pines was not the case several years ago, when many 
parents opted for private schools, upset that the school appeared to have no 
educational plan for dealing with the influx of Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
With the strengthened curriculum, more neighborhood parents now are willing to 
buy into the integration program. 
</P>
<P>
Parent Pat Masters said that parent volunteers in each classroom, plus the 
library's learning center, take some of the pressure off teachers from having 
to teach large reading groups, while offering more than basic skills in 
language arts and math. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our friends have kids in private schools," said Masters, a researcher 
at UCSD. "And because they had great concern about the adequacy of public 
schools, they urged us to go right to private school from the start. 
</P>
<P>
"But both my husband and I were products of public schools in Iowa and, if 
everyone pulls their kids out of public school, what are we then contributing 
to our educational system? Not much." 
</P>
<P>
Dunfee said, "I think I have an obligation to provide my (four) children with a 
splash of what real life is about, and public school contains every element of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Doyle notes that eight parents have returned their children to Torrey Pines 
this year from private academies. In addition, he said, barrio parents tell him 
that they bus their children to La Jolla schools because they perceive them as 
akin to private schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that private schools can touch us," Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Elementary Principal Trudy Campbell said that she had stomachaches 
several years ago over the need to balance the two goals of equity and academic 
excellence. 
</P>
<P>
As one major effort, Campbell and her staff introduced merging gifted and 
non-gifted classes this year in a new program. Under the move, students meet in 
mixed groups for part of the day, then separate into smaller groups for math, 
language -- English or bilingual -- and social studies, which vary in size and 
ethnicity subject-by-subject depending on ability levels. All the teachers in 
the two-grade program are certified to teach gifted students as a way to 
satisfy La Jolla parents who strongly identify with such teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get away from labeling kids as much as possible while still 
challenging all of our kids," said Campbell. In the district's latest annual 
report on integration to the Superior Court, it said that eight of 20 
classrooms last year at La Jolla Elementary were ethnically unbalanced. That 
figure, the largest among the district's 106 elementary schools, reflects those 
classes where the number of white or nonwhite students falls outside the 
school's acceptable range of 30% to 70%. 
</P>
<P>
In another program, Campbell has persuaded 30 parents of kindergarten and 
first-graders to place their children in bilingual English-Spanish classes, 
where the English speakers begin to learn Spanish and the Spanish-speaking 
children have more opportunity to hear English each day from peers. Every other 
week, these La Jolla children receive all but their math and reading 
instruction in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, we've had nothing but good results," Campbell said of the 
"buddylingual" experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Martie Rice, a PTA parent at the school, has placed her daughter in the class 
and said that, "while some always worry that the barrio kids will hurt their 
kids academically, in almost all cases, it is a fear that is not accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"In my daughter's class, there are always at least two adults, a teacher and 
parent volunteer or teacher and aide, and there is a music teacher each week, 
art teacher and computer teacher." Much of the special enrichment results from 
the school's parent-supported foundation. 
</P>
<P>
But even Rice admits to sweaty palms about sending her older son to Muirlands 
next year because many students eligible for gifted-level instruction in 
English and social studies end up in ethnically mixed regular classes. 
Placement in advanced math and science courses is based on achievement in 
previous years' courses, test scores and teacher recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents have perceived the regular, non-GATE classes as unchallenging 
because of the wide range of academic abilities among the students, and at a 
time when those in the highly competitive community first begin to think about 
college for their children. 
</P>
<P>
But Muirlands would have a tremendous number of classes unbalanced ethnically 
if it offered GATE-level classes to everyone who qualified. School 
administrators fear that, if they don't limit the number of GATE classes, they 
could end up with the two-tiered education system the public schools must 
avoid: affluent La Jolla kids, mostly white, in the GATE classes, and 
inner-city kids, mostly Latino, in the regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Kalish has one daughter who is a junior at La Jolla High and a second in 
the eighth grade at Muirlands, both in the GATE program. "They are getting a 
terrific education, and I can't imagine a (private school) experience could be 
any more enriching," Kalish said. 
</P>
<P>
But, if the enrichment curriculum were unavailable, Kalish would be less 
enthralled. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to put reins on my kids; I don't want the schools to tell me 
what kids can't do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Muirlands Principal Allan Peck has a variety of experiments under way to cover 
the ground for both the 600 resident students and the 300 barrio students in 
the integration program, with their varied home environments and cultural 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Some high-achieving students who would qualify for GATE-level classes in almost 
any other city junior high are now offered a special curriculum similar to GATE 
but without the specific designation. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers in other classes are trying a concept called "differential education," 
in which they tell students the different academic requirements for a "C," a 
"B," or an "A" grade, such as the number of books or essays or a creative 
project required to earn a particular grade. Students are then asked to work at 
the level they believe is best for them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not tracking, it's not a rigid division" because the students can choose 
a regular or accelerated level, said Peck, careful to avoid implementing a 
program that could rigidly result in students separated by ethnicity and bring 
the wrath of the district's integration monitors down upon his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather, we have found that there is some peer pressure among students to do 
more . . . to try more creative things than just work sheets and vocabulary 
kits," Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
Peck believes the drop-off of La Jolla students between the elementary schools 
and Muirlands is lessening, saying that the school received about 30 more 
seventh-graders this fall than expected. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla High principal J Tarvin, acknowledged as a master both by board member 
Davis and assistant superintendent Catherine Hopper, promotes his school among 
uncertain parents by showing them grade-point averages, SAT test scores and the 
list of universities attended by its 100 top graduates from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Names such as Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Brown, stand out prominently, along with 
all of the UC campuses. Tarvin brags about the 83% of the 430 graduates last 
year who attend four-year colleges or universities, and says that a strong 
majority of his nonwhite students who bus -- 28% of the school's 1,150 students 
-- are among the group. 
</P>
<P>
"All classes at La Jolla are open to all students," Tarvin tells parents. "We 
do not have GATE as such, we have advanced placement courses, but even our 
regular courses are college preparatory. 
</P>
<P>
"We absolutely are not competing with other public high schools . . . we are 
competing with the private schools." 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla High picks up about 50 students a year at all grade levels, Tarvin 
said. Some come from Bishop's and La Jolla Country Day, where about 10% of the 
ninth-graders at each school decide they want the traditional public high 
school experience. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla parent Diana Armstrong, whose son attended the prestigious Horace Mann 
School in New York City before moving to San Diego, said that La Jolla High "is 
extraordinary for a public school . . . with an incredible amount of talent and 
depth . . . a private school without the $7,000 tuition."

Thank you for choosing to run Jenifer Warren's article about the Desert Bill 
("Bill to Protect Desert Draws a Noisy 2,000," Nov. 12). She is a good writer 
and leads her readers to think a little ahead and in a responsible way. I've 
been told that the Native Americans, when deciding important issues like this, 
asked themselves, "How will this affect the people seven generations from now?" 
Jenifer's writing helps the general public to start thinking that way.

POLITICAL VISION BEHIND COURT VOTE WELCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the county Board of Supervisors decided last week that it made better 
long-term sense to build North County courts in Vista instead of Escondido, 
despite Escondido's more generous financial offer, board Chairwoman Susan 
Golding commented that she wanted "to make one decision on this board that's 
not a Band-Aid." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it's a rare government decision these days that is not a Band-Aid -- 
sometimes for lack of vision or political will, but more often for financial 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
So the courts vote was noteworthy. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps more extraordinary is that in the past 10 days, there have actually 
been three instances of forward-looking action by local government officials. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the San Diego City Council voted to establish a housing trust fund 
to preserve and expand the amount of housing affordable to low-income 
residents. At the same time, the council also voted to commit $54 million in 
new taxes and fees to the fund. It was a bold move that could go a long way 
toward meeting a pressing need in the city, although the nature and amount of 
the taxes and fees should be carefully weighed along with proposals to fund 
other infrastructure and public service needs before final decisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
The third noteworthy move occurred Dec. 8 when San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor 
urged the City Council to adopt a proposed managed-growth ballot initiative and 
to strengthen the city's environmental protections. 
</P>
<P>
With the recent election of council members Linda Bernhardt and John Hartley, 
O'Connor apparently realized that the timing might be right to pass a tougher 
growth-management ordinance. Instead of letting competing citizens measures go 
on the ballot again, O'Connor encouraged the council to adopt a proposal by the 
group Prevent Los Angelization Now!, a sequel to last year's Citizens for 
Limited Growth. 
</P>
<P>
The council should not adopt the measure without sufficient debate and 
refinement, but the proposal has much to recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, three acts of leadership do not mean an end to Band-Aids. Politics 
and the scarcity of public resources assure that. 
</P>
<P>
But, if the electorate shows its support for such actions, it will be easier 
for tomorrow's leaders to look beyond just tomorrow.

REDONDO CITY SCHOOL BOARD VOWS TO KEEP DISPUTED TEXTS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: AT LEAST TWO SCHOOL TRUSTEES WANT TO ALLOW USE OF THE PREVIOUSLY 
WITHDRAWN FIFTH-GRADE READERS FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite pressure from a coalition of parents who have joined a national 
campaign against a set of grade-school readers, it is unlikely the books will 
be removed from the curriculum in Redondo Beach, school trustees said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue is really getting out of hand," said Rebecca Sargent, president of 
the Redondo Beach City School District Board of Trustees. "If this board is 
asked to ban textbooks -- well, that's just not going to happen in Redondo 
Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Sargent's reaction -- echoed by a majority of the five-member board -- came in 
the wake of a packed Tuesday night board meeting, where members of the newly 
formed Coalition of Concerned Parents demanded the "Impressions" reading series 
be sent back to the publisher. 
</P>
<P>
The demand, spearheaded by a group of parents from Hope Chapel, a local 
conservative Christian church, was the latest salvo in a national war on the 
textbooks that has been backed mostly by fundamentalist Christians and others. 
They say the stories in the books are violent and immoral. 
</P>
<P>
Because the issue was scheduled on the agenda as an "information only" item, 
the board did not act on the request. However, TRW engineer John Ryan, 
spokesman for the coalition, said the group intends to force the matter to a 
vote and is circulating a petition demanding the series be eliminated from 
Redondo Beach's classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the meeting, Bart Swanson, vice president of the board, 
noted that the books went through a thorough screening process before being 
accepted as the basal reading text in the city's elementary schools. Part of 
that process, he and others added, was a period of several weeks this past 
spring when the books were made available to any parent for examination. 
</P>
<P>
When parents in other school districts began to complain about the books 
earlier this school year, the trustees tried to preempt controversy in Redondo 
Beach by temporarily pulling the most highly criticized book -- a fifth-grade 
reader -- and replacing it for the first semester of the school year with 
another volume of the series by Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston of Canada Ltd., a 
subsidiary of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Swanson and Sargent said, they are inclined to allow teachers to use the 
fifth-grade text during the second half of the year. The two said they have 
studied the book, and, despite a much-publicized poem in it about 
excreta-eating pigs, they found nothing in it to substantiate claims that its 
text teaches satanism or is immoral. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care for this after-the-fact situation," Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Trustee Howard Huizing, "These stories are just a few pages out of a big 
work." To shelve the whole series, he said, "would be a hasty decision to make 
about hundreds and hundreds of pages of literature." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the poem on the excreta-eating pig, the fifth-grade reader contains 
another, "He's Behind Yer," about a monster that bites off a child's head. A 
chapter on sorcery is included in the fourth-grade book. 
</P>
<P>
The "Impressions" series has stirred a dispute in several California school 
districts, including the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District in the San 
Gabriel Valley, where it was dropped, and the East Whittier School District, 
where trustees were dismayed when the publisher sent the U.S. version of the 
series instead of the toned-down Canadian version. 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale, too, had ordered the Canadian texts but received the U.S. versions 
for their fourth-, fifth- and sixth-grade readers. Trustees decided the fourth- 
and sixth-grade readers were acceptable, but fifth-graders there are using 
another text, pending state approval and receipt of the book's Canadian 
version. 
</P>
<P>
It is the U.S. version that is being used in Redondo Beach schools. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who launched the local effort against the books only a few weeks ago, 
after hearing about the series' problems in other districts, said he was not 
surprised at the reaction of Redondo Beach trustees. 
</P>
<P>
"They're right," he said. "We should have looked over the books before they 
were approved. But parents sometimes just trust the school to do the right 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan added, however, that he isn't discouraged by the trustees' remarks. By the 
time his coalition gets the issue onto the board agenda for a vote, public 
sentiment against the books may have gathered so much steam that the trustees 
may be forced to change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"Any parent who reads this material would not want their child to see it," he 
said. "It's time to see now how many of them are willing to stand up."

WAR REFUGEES FORM DEADLY L.A. GANGS;

CRIME: CENTRAL AMERICAN REFUGEES IMMUNE TO VIOLENCE ARE A GROWING PART OF 
L.A.'S GANG CULTURE. 'THEY LAUGH AT DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS,' ONE EXPERT SAYS.

Upheaval in Central America is renewing itself in the barrios of Los Angeles, 
where the influx of refugees into some of the city's most troubled 
neighborhoods has led to the rise of a new generation of youth gangs, 
authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs of young men with roots in El Salvador, Guatemala and other Central 
American nations make up about 5% of the city's estimated 300 youth gangs, Los 
Angeles police say. But the influence of these Central American gangs is 
growing as they carve out niches in the San Fernando Valley and in the inner 
city, according to police and other gang experts. 
</P>
<P>
Mara Salvatrucha, a Salvadoran gang that came into existence only six years 
ago, has grown to 500 members, making it as large as entrenched 
Mexican-American gangs, authorities say. Members of Mara Salvatrucha and Crazy 
Riders, another gang with largely Central American membership, have been linked 
by police -- either as victims or suspects -- to five murders. Authorities say, 
however, they suspect that the gangs are involved in many other killings. 
</P>
<P>
"They're on the increase, and they're making a name for themselves," Detective 
Robert Contreras, of the Los Angeles Police Department's Gang Information 
Section, said of the city's Central American gangs. 
</P>
<P>
The proliferation of Central American gangs is especially troubling because 
members have a greater tendency to react with violence, police say. Authorities 
attribute this to the horrors that many Central Americans have witnessed back 
home, such as seeing family members executed by Salvadoran death squads. 
</P>
<P>
"In their countries, they're used to bombs and decapitated bodies," said Manuel 
Velasquez, a spokesman for the city's Community Youth Gang Services agency in 
the San Fernando Valley. "They laugh at drive-by shootings." 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested two alleged members of the Crazy Riders on Nov. 10 in 
connection with the drive-by shooting in Van Nuys of Walter Adama, 17, killed 
while standing in front of his home on Fulton Avenue. Police also suspect these 
gangs of involvement in a rash of car thefts several months ago in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The Crazy Riders also was implicated in a major turf battle late last month 
with another Latino gang near MacArthur Park, in which two people were killed 
and six were injured. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned because they don't hesitate to exert influence on other 
gangs," said Detective Cliff Ruff of the Police Department's Foothill Division 
in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, hard times and war have brought as many as 500,000 refugees to 
the Los Angeles area from Guatemala and El Salvador alone, according to the 
Central American Refugee Center, which helps refugees obtain asylum in the 
United States. Others have come from Nicaragua, but the vast majority have come 
from El Salvador, which is in the midst of a decade-long civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Haydee Sanchez, a spokeswoman for El Rescate, which provides legal and social 
services to refugees, said the long war has taken a toll on Salvadoran 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"Little kids, at the beginning of the war, were scared when they saw bodies in 
the streets," said Sanchez, who is from El Salvador. "Later, they didn't care 
anymore. I have a lot of cases of boys who saw relatives killed. Later on, 
these kids are doing the same thing to others" on the streets of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of the migration that began in the late 1970s, Central 
American youths joined traditional Mexican-American gangs, experts say. In 
recent years, however, such youths have broken away from the traditional gangs 
and formed rival organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Mara Salvatrucha, the best-known Central American gang, originated in the 
downtown Los Angeles area several years ago but has spread to other areas of 
the city. Gang services workers say Mara Salvatrucha is the most difficult gang 
to work with. Its chapters are nomadic, fading out of one area and into 
another, they say. 
</P>
<P>
There are smaller bands of Nicaraguans, Hondurans and Guatemalans sprinkled 
around the city. Members include recent immigrants and those whose families 
migrated to the United States as long as a decade ago, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The territory being claimed by these gangs includes central Van Nuys and 
streets with deteriorating apartment buildings near MacArthur Park. Central 
American gang graffiti -- "MS," for Mara Salvatrucha (which, roughly 
translated, means "tough Salvadorans,") and "CRS" for Crazy Riders -- are 
frequently seen on downtown Los Angeles buildings and is increasingly spotted 
in the Valley, police and community experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Mara Salvatrucha members have shown up at Grant High School in Van Nuys, where 
students are bused from the downtown Los Angeles area, said Fran Ramirez, an 
assistant principal. She said they have been involved in several beatings at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
"They all fit into the big puzzle" in the Valley, Velasquez said of the Central 
American gangs. 
</P>
<P>
A 14-year-old Salvadoran boy nicknamed Little Cobra, declaring that he has quit 
Mara Salvatrucha, said violence has escalated lately in areas frequented by 
Central American gangs. "Everybody's getting killed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past four months, according to John Garcia, a downtown Community Youth 
Gang Services worker, five members of the well-known 18th Street gang, whose 
membership is predominantly Mexican-American, have been killed. The Crazy 
Riders gang is feuding with the 18th Street gang. 
</P>
<P>
While authorities say the Central American gangs are growing in size and 
influence, they also argue that the percentage of immigrant youths choosing a 
gang life style is small. "Like anything else, it's only the few who cause the 
problems," said Jerry Greenfield, a gang expert in the Police Department's 
Rampart Division downtown, where many of the gang members live. 
</P>
<P>
Although the various chapters of Mara Salvatrucha are involved in the same type 
of criminal activity as traditional Mexican-American gangs, there are 
differences in style, experts say. Central American gang members often dress in 
Iron Maiden T-shirts and listen to heavy-metal music, while many 
Mexican-American gang members prefer the cholo look and listen to rock 'n' roll 
oldies. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Mora, 20, a Salvadoran whose nickname is "Micho," said he joined Mara 
Salvatrucha for protection. Mora, who has been in the United States for three 
years, said he also joined because of racism in traditional gangs against 
people who are not of Mexican descent. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez said some traditional Latino gangs look down on recent immigrants. 
Eddie Vega, Valesquez's colleague downtown, said that when the Central 
Americans first arrived, Mexican-American gang members "pushed them around. So 
they formed their own gangs." 
</P>
<P>
In working with the Central Americans, Vega tries to show them that there is 
enough freedom in the United States for an immigrant to make his own way. "This 
isn't El Salvador -- you can live a normal life and make honest money here," 
Vega said he tells them. 
</P>
<P>
But Sanchez said staying away from gangs is hard for recent immigrants of 
war-torn countries, who often are friendless and have lost parents. In other 
cases, say experts, Central American immigrant parents come to the United 
States first, then send for their children, sometimes years later. This can 
create alienation in the home that leads some youths to seek comfort in the 
gangs, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them tell me they become a member of the gangs because it's the only 
way to survive in the U. S," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
She recalled a boy named Edwin, who saw his father murdered by Salvadoran 
political extremists when he was 14. He and his mother packed and headed to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
But when he settled in Los Angeles, the timid boy from San Salvador encountered 
a different kind of urban terror -- youth gangs. They whistled and called for 
him outside his apartment in a crime-ridden, drug-infested neighborhood and 
sometimes prevented him from going to school. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'I don't know what to do,' " Sanchez said. "He said, 'I want to be 
good.' " 
</P>
<P>
Edwin's battle for independence from the gangs ended last year when he was 
arrested for car theft after joining a gang. While he was in Juvenile Hall in 
San Fernando, his mother died of an untreated case of pneumonia, leaving behind 
an angry young man who is almost unrecognizable as the earnest boy who wanted 
to study and do well in America, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Morales, a clinical social worker in the Department of Psychiatry and 
Biobehavioral Sciences at UCLA, said theories tend to support police and 
community gang experts' assertions that the violence to which such gang members 
were exposed back home makes them more likely to lash out in America. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been desensitized to the value of human life," Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
A 25-year-old Mexican-American woman who gave her name as Smiley said she 
learned about Mara Salvatrucha when she moved in with her boyfriend, a 
Salvadoran gang member. "The ones from MS, they're scary to be around," she 
said. "They grow up over there with killing inside them." She moved out after 
he began beating her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many members of Central American gangs are in the United States illegally, 
police say. They complain of the difficulty of deporting gang members who are 
not legal residents. But Bob Moschorak, acting director of the Los Angeles 
district office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said taking 
action against criminal illegal immigrants is a top priority of the agency. In 
November, the INS deported 1,069 illegal immigrants identified as criminals. He 
said that was the largest number in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The INS has officers assigned to work with police in targeting gang members 
believed to be here illegally. But Moschorak said the agency does not deport 
criminal aliens until they have served their sentences in the United States. 
"No one should be given the opportunity to avoid the system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Crazy Riders attracted attention late last month when they were involved in 
what was described by police as a large turf battle with the 18th Street gang, 
which has been in existence for at least 40 years and has about 500 members. 
Within a 24-hour period, a pregnant woman was shot in the abdomen and a female 
pedestrian was paralyzed by a bullet in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
All the shootings occurred within a two-square-mile area east of MacArthur 
Park. The attacks culminated with the wounding of four members of the Crazy 
Riders when their car broke down as they were trying to escape the rival gang. 
One gang member and a 16-year-old Latino youth, shot during an exchange of gang 
names, were killed, bringing the total casualties to eight. 
</P>
<P>
Even before that incident, Vega said, members of Mara Salvatrucha had shot up a 
peace conference between the 18th Street gang and the Crazy Riders. Vega said 
his gang sources told him that several people were hit, although police could 
not verify his account.

NEW MUSEUM KEEPS OLD LANCASTER ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As W. M. (Bud) Redman leads an impromptu tour of the Western Hotel/Museum in 
downtown Lancaster, he ventures deeper and deeper into the memories housed in 
the city's oldest building and newest cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
"This was my room right here," says Redman, the city's 86-year-old treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
He scrutinizes a photograph on the wall from the early 1900s; stiffly posed 
members of a social club stare back at him: "Jesus, there's some old-timers." 
Redman's family migrated from Missouri in 1911, in hopes that the desert air 
would improve his mother's poor health. 
</P>
<P>
Like Redman, the 101-year-old Western Hotel is a Lancaster institution. It 
reopened recently as a small city-run museum, which mixes history with a bit of 
anthropology to recount the frontier saga of Lancaster and surrounding Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Community interest moved city officials to rescue the building from destruction 
in the 1970s. The staff of the Lancaster Museum/Art Gallery researched and 
re-created the hotel's past, using newspaper archives and the help of Redman 
and other old-timers who supplied oral histories, photos and keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
Some exhibits feature photographs, period clothes, furniture and artifacts of 
people who lived or stayed at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Other sections are devoted to American Indian tribes of the region; to former 
Lancaster resident Judy Garland, who was born Frances Gumm and whose father 
managed the Valley Theater down the street; and to the pronghorn antelope, 
which gave the valley its name before a wholesale slaughter wiped out the 
population by the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
The museum fulfills the wishes of Myrtle Webber, hotel proprietor from 1914 to 
1974, said curator Norma Gurba. 
</P>
<P>
"She had three wishes," Gurba said. "That the hotel be made a state historical 
marker, which happened in the 1950s, that it be restored and that it be turned 
into a museum." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the city on Lancaster Boulevard, the hotel served as a central 
backdrop for those who founded and built the community: laborers, land 
speculators, immigrants, scholars, church groups, chamber-of-commerce types, 
drinkers, scoundrels. 
</P>
<P>
And no shortage of characters, as Redman recalls in his Western drawl: He 
describes Webber's husband, George, as a "dried-up little fella" who kept a 
saloon in the hotel and "liked to get in the jug pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Webber was an Englishman; many of the valley's early settlers were either from 
England or Germany. He emigrated in 1886, two years before shoemaker and 
businessman Louis Van Rockabrand built the hotel, originally named the Antelope 
Valley Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Webber's original ambitions were considerably more picturesque than the 
hospitality business. He headed a project for the London Daily Telegraph in 
which the pulp from the abundant Joshua trees was to be developed as a paper 
source. There were stories that Webber hoped to set up a business selling 
Joshua tree lumber for the manufacture of wooden prosthetics, Redman said. 
</P>
<P>
A contingent of Chinese laborers chopped down scores of trees that were shipped 
to England, according to museum research, but the London newspaper soon 
abandoned the idea as costly and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
Webber stayed, became manager of the hotel in 1903 and purchased it in 1908. He 
married Myrtle Sullivan in 1910 and placed the property in her name four years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Previous owners included Joshua Constable, who changed the name to the Gillwyn 
Hotel and whose handbill on a museum wall reflects the prejudices of the times: 
"I never employ Chinese or colored labor." 
</P>
<P>
The museum exhibits show that the valley's current boom-town image has had 
other incarnations. A pre-1900 advertisement touts: "Lancaster: the coming city 
of the plain." Unsavory land dealers used doctored pictures depicting oranges 
on Joshua trees and cardboard cityscapes in the desert to lure customers, Gurba 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And a newspaper clipping quotes turn-of-the-century Palmdale resident C. W. 
Dodenhoff's statement that he enjoyed his visit to Lancaster (population 250), 
but was glad to get back to the "rural precincts of Palmdale" because he "could 
never appreciate the rush and hurry of life in a big city." 
</P>
<P>
Although the word "city" was highly inaccurate, Lancaster grew thanks to the 
advent of the Southern Pacific Railroad, alfalfa- and fruit-based agriculture 
and the construction of the California Aqueduct between 1905 and 1913. 
</P>
<P>
George Webber set up a "tent city" next to the Western Hotel to accommodate 
hundreds of aqueduct workers. Redman recalls the tent city because his grammar 
school was across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Of the aqueduct workers who frequented saloons at the hotel, and others grouped 
around Lancaster Boulevard and the Sierra Highway, Redman says, "There were a 
few fights. They'd get a little inebriated, but not bad." 
</P>
<P>
The Western Hotel became a town center. The dining room was the birthplace of 
the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce. It became a makeshift hospital during the 
influenza epidemic of 1918. Redman and his family came down with influenza, and 
he has a distinct memory of Myrtle Webber taking a buggy out to their ranch to 
care for the family. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knew Myrtle," says Redman, who stayed at the hotel when he first 
moved to town in 1921 to drive a truck for the Union Oil Co. "She was a good 
woman." 
</P>
<P>
In 1934, Myrtle Webber became a widow. She sold the land next to the hotel to 
the federal government, and the Depression-era Works Progress Administration 
built a post office that remains today. Webber also displayed her toughness by 
surviving a 1935 gas explosion that damaged the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The building functioned both as a hotel and community meeting place for almost 
four more decades. Webber was active in civic affairs and Republican politics: 
A 1950s-era photo shows her with then-Vice President Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Webber was placed in a convalescent home in 1971 and died in 1978 at the age of 
110. In her absence, the hotel decayed, was vandalized and finally was 
condemned as unsafe by Los Angeles County in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
A campaign initiated by an eighth-grade history class from the Park View School 
prevented demolition, however. The Western Hotel Historical Society raised 
$40,000 to buy the property, and the city began the restoration process, which 
involved physically moving the building back 10 feet from Lancaster Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Redman went on to become a car dealer and an original member of the Antelope 
Valley Fair Board of Directors. He was appointed city treasurer in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Redman believes that the hotel's new look is a bit too modern, but he generally 
is pleased with the effort to preserve a place where his life and Lancaster's 
history intertwine. 
</P>
<P>
"They fixed it up pretty nice," he says. "It's nice to have it here for 
posterity's sake."

LITTLE LEAGUE PARK STIRS BIG LEAGUE FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: PROPONENTS WANT TO BUILD BASEBALL DIAMOND IN STUDIO CITY PARK. 
OPPONENTS SAY THE SITE SHOULD REMAIN OPEN SPACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to put a Little League field in a Studio City park is striking out 
with some residents who want the area developed as open space. 
</P>
<P>
But proponents of adding a baseball diamond to South Weddington Park said they 
will keep trying to convince residents that the field would be an asset to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the fate of a four-acre portion of South Weddington Park, which is 
a vacant, dusty lot near Valleyheart Drive and the Hollywood Freeway. Thursday 
night, about 40 residents attended a meeting sponsored by Councilman John 
Ferraro to discuss how to develop the land, but no consensus was reached. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball is the greatest developer of kids in the United States," said Guy 
Weddington McCreary, whose family donated part of the 12-acre park to the city 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody agrees baseball is great for kids, but there's not enough green 
space as it is," countered Ray Aleman, a Studio City resident. "And gangs tend 
to congregate in the bleachers near the field that is already in the park." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Presby, one of Ferraro's deputies, said a second meeting will be held in 
January. "It may take us a year or more, but I'm really optimistic we can reach 
a consensus," Presby said. 
</P>
<P>
Tempers were hot at the meeting. Apparently exasperated after listening to 
Little League proponents call the undeveloped land an eyesore, one woman 
shouted: "Don't make it seem like we live in a slum!" 
</P>
<P>
Winona Hagan, 78, whose home borders the park, said Little League brings 
"congestion, noise, a lack of parking and hanky-panky." 
</P>
<P>
John Whitman, president of Toluca Little League, said the league works hard to 
clean and maintain the three fields it uses, including one in South Weddington 
Park. He said the organization, one of about 12 nonprofit leagues in the San 
Fernando Valley, has had to turn away boys and girls this year because of a 
shortage of places to play. 
</P>
<P>
The field would cost $50,000 to $70,000 to build, said Alonzo Carmichael, a 
planning officer for the city Department of Recreation and Parks. Developing 
the vacant land as open space, with grass, trees and a sprinkler system, would 
cost about $140,000, he said. Residents probably will have to raise the money 
to pay for either project because the city does not have the funds, he said.

"We would do our darndest to come up with the money -- we want the field that 
much," said Frank Miceli, a league vice president.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: HARBOR HILLS RESIDENTS BEWILDERED BY MYSTERY MAILER 
WARNING OF GANG MENACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Karen Reed has lived in the Harbor Hills Housing Project in Lomita for 22 
years, raised two daughters there, is close friends with her neighbors and has 
never worried about gangs or crime. 
</P>
<P>
"We sit out here and talk to our neighbors at night, our kids play in the 
streets," Reed said last week as she stood outside her apartment. "You just 
don't do that in infested areas." 
</P>
<P>
So Reed was more than a little surprised when she was handed a copy of a mailer 
that had recently been distributed in the middle-class neighborhood surrounding 
Harbor Hills. The mailer warned that gangs were moving into the 300-unit 
complex, turning it into "a spawning ground and haven for gang-terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
"Gang-terrorists In Harbor Hills County Housing Project!" its headline 
screamed. "Rolling Hills, Lomita and Rolling Ranchos Under Siege!" 
</P>
<P>
The mailer, purportedly put out by a group called the Citizens Anti-Terrorist 
Underground, preached that tax dollars were being used to support "the Crips, 
the Bloods, and other gangs with low-cost housing while they invade and destroy 
your neighborhood and your property values." 
</P>
<P>
" . . . These gangs are GROWING and EXPANDING, overflowing the boundaries of 
South Central Los Angeles, Wilmington and Harbor City and invading peaceful 
communities as far away as Iowa!" the mailer continued. 
</P>
<P>
Just who was responsible for the five-page pamphlet is as anonymous as the 
Manila envelopes in which they were mailed. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agencies in California and Arizona -- the mailer carried a 
Phoenix postmark -- said they have never heard of such a group. A single 
individual could have been behind it, they said. 
</P>
<P>
And just how many mailers were sent out -- they were addressed simply to 
"resident" -- is also unknown. Several homeowners on nearby Hillcrest Avenue, a 
stone's throw away from the complex, said they received a copy; another woman 
who lives a few blocks away said she also got one. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hate mail, that's all it is, hate mail," said Milton Patterson, who 
oversees Harbor Hills for the county's Community Development Commission. ". . . 
I have no tolerance for it." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson and Los Angeles Sheriff's Capt. Dennis Gillard, who heads the Lomita 
station, said they are unaware of any organized gang activity at Harbor Hills, 
a sprawling complex that borders Western Avenue in the southernmost part of 
Lomita. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are gang members who live in or visit the complex, and there 
have been narcotic busts there, Gillard said that the more violent gang-related 
activities common in nearby communities such as Harbor City or Wilmington are 
non-existent at Harbor Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the last year, I think we have had more (gang problems) than in the 
past," Gillard said. "But when I say more, we're only talking a half-dozen or 
so incidents, and that is certainly very, very minor compared to the frequent 
daily activities we have elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
The mailer prompted only a phone call or two to the Lomita station from 
residents wondering whether its claims were true. "The phone hasn't been 
ringing off the hook. I think a lot of people recognize nonsense when they read 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That was the case with one Lomita man, who requested anonymity. He said his 
mother had received a copy and showed it to him. Neither he nor his mother, who 
has lived in the neighborhood since 1949 without experiencing any crime 
problems, were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a waste of paper," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Lomita woman who received the mailer said she was concerned about the type of 
people behind the pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer urged residents to organize into small groups to fight gangs and to 
"carry out in secret those activities to combat gang-terrorism that cannot be 
carried out in mass." The mailer stopped short of advocating violence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was scary to me, it really was," said the woman, who also asked that her 
name not be used. ". . . I'm just as afraid of people like that as I am of the 
gangs. I think they are gangs." 
</P>
<P>
At Harbor Hills, about 10 residents interviewed one day last week appeared more 
bewildered than angered by the mailer's rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
Katria Newsome, who was visiting her aunt at the complex, said that compared to 
the South-Central Los Angeles housing project where some of her relatives live 
and where she dreads to visit, Harbor Hills feels like a sanctuary from gangs 
and criminal activities. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the quietest projects I have ever seen," she said as she tended to 
her two small children. "These are like apartments." 
</P>
<P>
Said Edna Young, who has lived at Harbor Hills for more than 30 years and 
raised five children there, "It's been really good in this project, thank God."

FETAL CELL'S UNIQUENESS AT BASE OF DEBATE 
</P>

<P>
The ethical battle over using fetal tissue is the battle over abortions one 
step removed. 
</P>
<P>
On one side are the scientists who feel that fetuses are available and it would 
be a shame not to put them to some positive use, such as helping victims of 
degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side are those who think sanctioning the use of fetal tissue might 
encourage abortions as a source of such material. 
</P>
<P>
"The analogy that is made, which is a very difficult analogy, is would you use 
kidneys from concentration camps for transplantation?" said Robert C. 
Baumiller, director of the Division of Genetics at Georgetown University, in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Depending on where you are on the abortion question, you would be using for 
good, parts of those who improperly had their lives taken," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A ban on using federal money for fetal tissue research was imposed a year ago, 
and James Mason, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and 
Human Services said he intends to continue it indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Fetal cells are valued by researchers, he said, because they still are in the 
process of developing. 
</P>
<P>
"What a fetal cell does better than any cell from an individual after birth is 
grow," he said. "There are growth factors present within a fetal human which 
are unique to that system; they have a vitality that is unique." 
</P>
<P>
But, said Baumiller, no one really knows how that vitality might be transferred 
from cell to cell. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe it may be possible to treat a variety of diseases by 
transplanting tissue taken from aborted fetuses. There were especially hopeful 
signs in use of such tissues in treating Parkinson's Disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of Parkinson's, we think there might be some advantage with other 
neurological degenerative diseases, especially those with cells which are kind 
of sister cells," said Baumiller. "The next question would be, if it helps in 
Alzheimer's Disease, could it help perhaps in Huntington's, any place where you 
have a neurological degenerative condition?" 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Hay, head of the cell culture department of the American Type 
Culture Collection in Rockville, Md., said fetal cells have provided 
information on aging and cell transformation -- the change from normal to 
cancerous properties -- and in virus replication studies and studies of 
chemicals that affect human cells. 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that there is enough primate research already being carried out that 
no one needs human fetal research. 
</P>
<P>
"Human cells behave differently than cells from animals," said Hay. "There are 
properties of human cells we obviously need to know about that differ from 
those of a mouse or a rat." 
</P>
<P>
The ethics of using tissue from aborted fetuses were studied recently by a 
committee at Stanford University, which drew up guidelines that include: 
</P>
<P>
* Women who undergo abortions should not benefit directly from the medical use 
of their fetuses. They should not be reimbursed for their abortions. 
</P>
<P>
* Medical personnel who perform abortions also should not profit from use of 
the fetal tissue. 
</P>
<P>
* Fetal tissue should be treated with the respect given to cadavers. 
</P>
<P>
* Fetuses should not be aborted for the specific purpose of using their tissue.

RESEARCHER HOPES RICE HULLER WILL AID THIRD WORLD 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If Allen Dong's rice huller was much cheaper, it would be free, which wouldn't 
bother him because he doesn't plan to profit from it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Dong didn't even patent the hand-powered contraption he devised that 
he says will make it easier for poor people in Third World countries to extract 
life-sustaining rice kernels from their hulls. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking into the various kinds of rice hullers and saw that they cost 
between $2,000 and $40,000," said Dong, a researcher with the UC Davis land, 
air and water resources department. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to make one in the $200 range, and after I made one, I kept going 
until I got it down to a kit costing $2.50 in this country," Dong said as he 
displayed his device at the university's student experimental farm. 
</P>
<P>
No patent has been sought for the rice huller, and Dong has turned it over to 
the public domain. He says it isn't practical for large California and other 
American rice growers to use, and a patent would have no effect in Third World 
countries where he hopes it will be used. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm living in a wealthy country. I don't need to get wealthy off the Third 
World," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the centuries, the time-consuming process of removing protective hulls 
involved beating rice kernels in a grinding bowl. That method has been replaced 
by mechanical hullers in advanced nations but still is used in many poor 
countries. Mechanical hullers that are used in poor regions are expensive to 
operate and maintain because they are made elsewhere, making replacement parts 
hard to find, Dong said. 
</P>
<P>
To overcome that problem, he simply took a small, hand-powered grinding mill 
that is common throughout the world and replaced the ridged grinding plate with 
a softer rubber plate. The softer plate pulverizes the outer rice hull, leaving 
the rice kernel ready to cook or market. 
</P>
<P>
Dong said he won't mind if a corporation makes a minor change in his invention, 
patents it and makes huges profits. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd have to find a way to do it for less than $2.50." he said. "It's so 
simple, cheap and easy to do. Why would anybody pay money for what they can do 
themselves?"

SOVIET DELEGATION TOURS 'STAR WARS' TEST PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under heavy security, a 10-member delegation of Soviet scientists and arms 
negotiators broke new ground in East-Wast relations on Saturday by touring a 
vital component of the United States' "Star Wars" research. 
</P>
<P>
The high-level Soviet visit to the 2,770-acre TRW Inc. laser testing facility, 
nestled in grassy hill country one mile north of San Clemente, capped months of 
planning between Soviet and American arms reduction negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet delegation was very pleased and interested in the tour," said a 
senior Bush Administration official who attended the precedent-setting visit to 
a U.S. laboratory conducting sensitive research on the controversial Strategic 
Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the visit "went a long way to demonstrating the value" of a new 
atmosphere of scientific cooperation that is being proposed in ongoing arms 
reduction talks in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be identified, was referring to a U.S. proposal 
that was put on the table in Geneva about two weeks ago. The proposed new 
Defense in Space Treaty would set up new ground rules for the development of 
space-based defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
One of the elements of the proposal is reciprocal laboratory visits. U.S. 
officials believe that the visit will set the stage for annual data exchanges 
between the two superpowers and will persuade the Soviets of the value of 
regular laboratory visits. 
</P>
<P>
First announced in September, Saturday's tour and inspection of the "Alpha" 
chemical laser system was billed as an extension of the Geneva strategic arms 
reduction talks, Marine Lt. Col. Alan R. Freitag said. 
</P>
<P>
Other than holding an impromptu press conference when the Soviets arrived 
Friday at the Marine Corps Air Station in El Toro, organizers of the tour 
maintained strict control over information about the tour. Neither the press 
nor local officials were allowed to accompany the group Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have even declined to say where the visitors spent the night on 
Friday, or whether they returned to the Marine base after the tour of the 
plant, located on unincorporated land at the end of Avenida Pico. 
</P>
<P>
The TRW facility is home to the "Alpha" chemical laser, a component of SDI's 
"Zenith Star" program, company officials said. Under the Zenith Star program, 
American researchers are hoping to develop a satellite-based laser that will 
detonate nuclear warheads in mid-trajectory. 
</P>
<P>
From the laser testing facility, the Soviet group was expected to move on to 
tour the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, another center where SDI 
research is being conducted. 
</P>
<P>
At Los Alamos, the Soviets will examine the Beam Experimental Aboard Rocket, a 
project that is developing rocket-mounted devices that will generate powerful 
beams of atomic particles. The particle beams will be able to either identify 
or destroy incoming missiles. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time Soviet officials have been privy to any part of the 
controversial Strategic Defense Initiative project, proposed by President 
Reagan as a shield against nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The $250-million Alpha device, under research for more than a decade, has long 
been described as the Pentagon's most promising technology for a small, 
lightweight laser that could be built with enough power to operate as a weapon 
in space.

CONDO FIRE DISPLACES FOUR FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A two-alarm blaze damaged a four-unit condominium complex Saturday morning, 
forcing four families to seek temporary housing, San Diego Fire Department 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started at 5:02 a.m. in the garage of the complex at 2818 Terrace 
Pines Drive. San Diego officials requested help from the Chula Vista Fire 
Department to battle the swift-moving blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The fire reached the attic and caused about $200,000 in damage to the building 
and $100,000 in damage to belongings. 
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross is providing temporary housing to one of the three 
displaced families. The couple, along with their 12-year-old daughter and 
5-year-old son, do not expect to return to their gutted home for the holidays 
and are temporarily in a motel, said Red Cross spokesman Dave Ricks.

MALATHION SPRAYING AND NEED FOR AN EIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would encourage the residents of Orange County, the Board of Supervisors . . 
. and others responsible for the health and welfare of the people to insist 
upon a thorough environmental impact report before any further malathion 
spraying is permitted. There is ample scientific evidence that malathion may be 
a dangerous carcinogen, as well as a neurologic toxin. Spraying everything in 
the hope of killing a few Medflies is about a nutty as trying to control AIDS 
by nuking San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The "authorities" would have you believe that malathion is harmless as applied. 
That's what they said about DDT and Alar. And what's really outrageous is that 
these agencies were frequently aware of toxicity problems but chose to cover 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
Malathion is a poison, and I find it highly immoral to place people in jeopardy 
because the Agriculture Department bureaucracy is either too stupid, too cheap, 
or both to keep a sufficient supply of sterile Medflies in continuous 
circulation, as well as for emergencies. Surely a multimillion-dollar industry 
doesn't have to be penny-wise and pound-foolish.

TRANSPORTATION AND GASOLINE SALES TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reply to letter writer Kent Moore (Dec. 3): His claim that gasoline taxes 
are being diverted into the state's General Fund is plain wrong. Gas taxes are 
going to Caltrans for building and operating the state highway system, 
including freeways, to rail guideway projects and to cities and counties for 
expenditure on local street improvements -- strictly to transportation, as they 
always have. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that the sales tax on gasoline, which is in addition to the gas tax, 
is going to the state's General Fund. However, by longstanding arrangement, 
that amount is being offset by directing one-fourth of a cent of the general 
sales tax to transportation -- mostly to fund transit operations, such as 
Orange County Transit District, which operates a countywide bus system. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature put this trade-off into law 17 years ago. The sales tax 
collected on gasoline in 1972 was equivalent to a one-fourth cent of sales tax 
on all retail sales. Taking all the years since, it has come out virtually 
even. There were four or five years after the second oil crisis, when gasoline 
prices shot up, that the state general fund came out ahead. But for each of the 
last four years, the state Transportation Fund has come out ahead, by between 
$16 million and $73 million.

FACING THE FACTS: ONE-PARTY SYSTEM FOR ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Sunday (Dec. 10), The Times ran an editorial stating, basically, that we 
Orange County Democrats are dead in the water; that for the "good" of the 
"two-party system" we should get our act together. 
</P>
<P>
We know The Times is well-meaning, but it is a bit out of touch (as they say) 
with reality. The voters of Orange County do not want a two-party system. They 
want a one-party system, and we propose to give it to them. 
</P>
<P>
We propose the Orange County Democratic Party officially declare that Orange 
County is run by Republicans. Even more revolutionary, we propose that the 
Republicans accept responsibility for running it. 
</P>
<P>
By officially withdrawing, Democrats no longer could be used as scapegoats. 
This would create big problems for local Republicans who need scapegoats very 
much. They need scapegoats to rail against, and harangue about, and blame for 
all the evils of society. They need this very badly so no one will notice one 
small fact: For the last 10 years, Orange County has been represented almost 
solely by Republicans, and they've fiddled while the county has deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
That this is true is self-evident. Just drive on a freeway or consider the 
county's failure to deal with (much less solve) any one of a hundred other 
specific problems. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Orange County Republicans do not deal with problems. It is against the 
primary Orange County Republican rule: The best government is no government. 
After all, if you try to use government to solve a problem, you have to admit 
that government has legitimate function. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Orange County Republican leaders have mealy-mouthed their way to 
victory for years. All they had to do was claim Orange County Democratic 
candidates were communists and spendthrift idiots and that they, the 
Republicans, would get government off everyone's back and off into a sunny 
fantasy land we all would ride. 
</P>
<P>
So, we Democrats propose that reality be recognized. We propose everyone admit 
that our Republican friends run the joint. And we propose that they, and we, 
ask one simple question: What do the Republicans intend to do with it? So far, 
they never have said. Nor accepted responsibility. Nor have they done squat as 
the county's quality of life steadily has declined. 
</P>
<P>
Special Note to The Times (for publication): We would like to take this one 
step further. Please ask the Republican Party why it took no position at all on 
the traffic initiative, Measure M, which narrowly lost in the last election. 
The Democratic Party endorsed it and the Democratic Foundation actively 
campaigned on its behalf. We do not state it was a perfect initiative. But at 
least it was an attempt to deal with our worst problem, traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party here in Orange County did not endorse the initiative. It 
did not oppose the initiative. Instead, the party (and most Orange County 
Republican officeholders), when faced with our single most important issue and 
with a real solution, did what they usually do. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Why?

CHILDREN AS PASSENGERS IN CAR-POOL LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter to the editor (Dec. 10), Christine Taxier raised an important point 
about car-pool lanes, in addition to the one about conserving energy. She 
righteously pointed out how she obeys the law by driving in a car-pool lane 
with no other adults in her car, only children. Yes, this qualifies her to do 
so, but she is only supporting the same illogic that our Orange County 
Transportation Commission uses. Supposedly, the objective of having a car-pool 
lane is to get drivers out of their cars, and to ride with some other driver -- 
thus eliminating one or more cars from the road. Using children to qualify as a 
car-pool driver does not eliminate one car from the road. 
</P>
<P>
A better car-pool lane rule would be to require two or more people of driver 
license age. Then we would have a greater probability that a passenger in the 
car is a licensed driver and, therefore, probably eliminating a car from the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Taxier misunderstood some of the dirty looks she gets from other 
motorists; maybe the dirty looks are because she has no adults in the car with 
her.

HEAVY METAL BANDS AT AMPHITHEATER

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I feel that the issue of volume, not curfew, should be raised concerning the 
Pacific Amphitheatre. Many concerts, especially those of heavy metal bands, are 
extremely loud and are capable of injuring a person's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
A curfew will not help control the noise the residents of the area are 
complaining about.

NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOL DISTRICT SEX EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is in response to the letter (Dec. 10) by James W. Angell, Robert 
P. Steward and Charles H. Sword. 
</P>
<P>
What needs to be made absolutely clear is what I, members and supporters of the 
Committee to Restore Ethical and Traditional Education (CREATE), and other 
concerned citizens of the Newport-Mesa school district have, and are, objecting 
to regarding some of the teaching in the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, we have objected to the teaching of sexual-arousal skills to high 
school students; we have objected to the demonstration of condoms on bananas, 
and the teacher making condoms available to students; we have objected to the 
showing of R-rated movies to children under the age of 17; and we have objected 
to teaching children that pedophiles (child abusers) really love children. 
</P>
<P>
We have also objected to the manner in which homosexuality has been taught. All 
we have ever asked is that both sides of this controversial issue be presented, 
as the rules and regulations of this district require. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of the letter writers to our objections is that "we intend to 
impose upon our schools our own specific moral code and system of censorship." 
The members of the school board, the administration, and these writers and 
others who are attacking us are hypocrites. If they really were concerned with 
censorship, and sincerely had a desire for intellectual and educational 
freedom, they would join with us and demand that the rules and regulations of 
the school district be enforced and that all sides of a controversial issue be 
presented. I cannot help but wonder what type of theological and political 
goals St. Mark Presbyterian Church must have to suggest that anyone who objects 
to this type of teaching is an ultra-radical extremist. 
</P>
<P>
We also wish to know why it is that a school district that refuses to allow 
Christmas carols to be sung so that no one would be offended has permitted the 
filthy, vulgar and disgusting presentation of sex as described above.

FACING THE FACTS: ONE-PARTY SYSTEM FOR ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The condition of the Orange County Democratic Party does mean fewer choices and 
less discussion for all voters, as described in your Dec. 10 editorial. 
However, this condition is not only caused by the party's inertia, it seems 
more like a deliberate choice. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the November election I received lots of direct mail from Orange 
County politicians and bureaucrats, sponsored by the builders and real estate 
developers, asking us to vote for an increase in the sales tax for construction 
and improvement of freeways and highways. I was amazed when one of the mailers 
came from the Orange County Democratic Party, signed by its chairman. Why does 
the Democratic Party choose to spend its resources on this nonpartisan 
election, urging support for an increase in the most regressive of taxes which 
falls most heavily on those least able to pay? 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County gridlock problem is real, and it results from the policies of 
present and past administrations in Sacramento and Washington, which chose to 
reduce the tax base and cut the heart out of domestic programs and 
infrastructure. The problem will be solved just as soon as these policies are 
changed. On the state level some appropriate changes seem to be on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with hundreds of homeless roaming the streets of Orange County, 
thousands who cannot afford medical insurance, local sweatshops exploiting 
women and children, and the public school system vastly underfunded, surely the 
Democrats can find some issue to espouse that's worthy of their progressive 
tradition. When they choose the "me too" position as they did in November, the 
voters are truly left with fewer choices.

LIMITING THE POPULATION IN CAMPAIGN TO CUT SMOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In your editorial (Dec. 6) on the recent Orange County Annual Survey, you 
seemed to suggest the problem of smog could be helped by each of us doing a 
little less polluting by curtailing our dependence on such things as gasoline 
lawn mowers and barbecue lighting fluid. 
</P>
<P>
I believe any measures can, at most, give only temporary relief. Without 
setting, and enforcing, some limit to the population of our county, there can 
be no long-term benefit to its environment. There is no measure that can be 
taken that will not be overwhelmed by the lethality of the unrestrained growth 
such as we have suffered in the last generation. 
</P>
<P>
So long as our population increases, our environment will deteriorate. The 
degradation in our quality of living will only end when the population has 
become stable.

SOCKERS LET ANOTHER ONE GET AWAY IN FINAL PERIOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WICHITA, Kan. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sockers' old formula for success was working well. Get a lead, force the 
opponents to come out and then punish them. 
</P>
<P>
It was going like clockwork. They had the Wichita Wings chasing shadows as they 
controlled the ball with crisp, one-touch passing. 
</P>
<P>
But in the final period, the Wings used high pressure and Chico Borja to score 
three goals for a 5-4 victory Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Crow, the Sockers' two-time MISL defender of the year, said losing late 
has been the story of the season for the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of games we've lost, we've been the better team for the first three 
quarters," he said. "We haven't proved to each other that we can suck it up and 
play as well in the fourth quarter as we do in the rest of the game, and it's 
hurting us." 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped the Sockers (7-8) 2 1/2 games behind Dallas in the MISL 
Western Division. 
</P>
<P>
Closing out an opponent traditionally has been a Socker trademark. Crow said 
it's not as easy as it once was. 
</P>
<P>
"The league is getting more competitive," he said. "We're not going into the 
fourth quarter with as big a lead as we used to." 
</P>
<P>
Some players play well in the clutch. That's been the story of the season for 
Borja, who scored the game-winner with 3:24 remaining. He has had the 
game-winning goal or assist in seven of the Wings' nine victories and leads the 
league in pressure points (goals or assists scored in the fourth quarter of a 
close game). Saturday, he came up with three more. 
</P>
<P>
The Wings became only the second team in history to win five in a row from the 
five-time Major Indoor Soccer League champions. Baltimore beat the Sockers five 
times last season. 
</P>
<P>
Borja said he didn't feel like a hero. 
</P>
<P>
"I stunk up the place for 55 minutes," he said. "I was really tired, and I 
didn't tell the coach I was tired, and I put my team in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
Borja said he kept going despite the fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"And thank goodness Mike Fox was there." 
</P>
<P>
Fox got the two goals that pulled the Wings back from a 4-2 deficit. Playing 
for the first time in a month after suffering a contusion on his shin, Fox 
toe-poked a shot from 40 feet that beat goalkeeper Zoltan Toth at the far post. 
</P>
<P>
Then he got the equalizer on a set play started by Borja from the restraining 
arc, scoring from the right corner of the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
Branko Segota got the first two goals, and Crow scored just before halftime for 
a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then Sockers midfielder Brian Quinn, also playing his first game in a month 
after recovering from an injury, scored from 30 feet on a restart pass from 
Segota. 
</P>
<P>
That made it 4-2 and put the Sockers in what seemed to be complete control. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we decided to turn things around by forcing them to make mistakes with 
full pressure," Wings defender Terry Rowe said. "We forced them to back-pedal, 
got the crowd into it, and that's what won the game for us." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Newman, the Sockers' coach, said, "They did an excellent job of putting 
high pressure on us. That could have been their undoing against a team like us, 
but I thought they did a good job of it." 
</P>
<P>
Newman said the equalizing goal was assisted by the officials, who gave the 
Wings a restart from the restraining arc instead at the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have had five goals, and that would have decided it. We had the 
chances but didn't put it in at the critical time. And you knew it would turn 
around and burn us." 
</P>
<P>
But on the game-winner, Newman said, "Chico Borja, if you give him that much 
room he's going to hurt you. He took a big chance staying upfield, and it 
turned out right for him." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers had a lot of chances, but goalkeeper Ron Fearon came up with some 
big saves, and defender Victor Moreland barely deflected a shot by Damir 
Haramina that had Fearon beat. That would have made it 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased with the way we were playing," Newman said, "but the ball never 
fell in the right places for the right players." 
</P>
<P>
Wings midfielder Tom Soehn lost control of an outlet pass by Toth and left 
Segota one-on-one with Fearon. Segota made lob shot off the outside of his 
right foot to get the ball over Fearon's head from the left side of the penalty 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Collins made the play that got the Sockers on the scoreboard first. He beat 
Fearon on the left side of the goal and fed Segota unmarked in the middle for 
an easy tap-in.

OVERPOWERING DEFENSE DROPS MATER DEI BY 7 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach Poly High School, using a tenacious defense and a patient passing 
game, reduced Mater Dei to just another basketball team Saturday night in the 
championship game of the Tournament of Champions at Ocean View High. 
</P>
<P>
Poly made key free throws down the stretch and defeated Mater Dei, 54-47, in 
front of 1,200 fans. It marked the first time Mater Dei had lost in the finals 
of this tournament after winning four titles. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (8-1) made only 20 of 57 shots and was never really in the game after 
watching an early 5-0 lead. Poly scored 11 consecutive points to take an 11-5 
lead and Mater Dei never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Poly (6-1) opened a 40-28 lead in the third quarter and then made eight free 
throws in the last period to win its third tournament championship and first 
since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Center Willie McGinest, one of the most sought-after football recruits in the 
nation, dominated play in the middle, blocking five shots and getting seven 
rebounds. McGinest was named the tournament's most valuable player despite 
scoring only seven points in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei had its chances as Poly committed 23 turnovers, but the Monarchs 
failed to capitalize. Guard David Boyle scored 16 points for Mater Dei, but 
missed eight three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We had problems getting our inside game going, and you can't live and die with 
the outside shot," said Gary McKnight, Mater Dei coach. "We came down time and 
time again and didn't get a shot off. 
</P>
<P>
"Poly's defense and pressure was the difference. We just didn't get the ball in 
the hole. I thought Poly got better and better as the tourney went on." 
</P>
<P>
Poly forward Roderick Hannibal didn't have any problems finding the range in 
the first half. He made his first seven shots, including a three-pointer at the 
halftime buzzer, and had 18 points in the first half. Hannibal led all scorers 
with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
"That guy killed us in the first half," McKnight said. "I saw Poly play last 
summer, and I thought they were one of the best teams I saw. They're back to 
playing (Coach Ron) Palmer-style basketball." 
</P>
<P>
In the third place game: 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley 71, Ocean View 54 -- Capistrano Valley used a fullcourt press 
in the third quarter to outscore Ocean View, 20-5, and then breezed to the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (7-1) made 15 of 29 shots in the second half. Forward Scott 
McCorkle led all scorers with 33 points, including 22 in the second half. Ocean 
View (6-2) committed 19 turnovers in losing its second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth place game: 
</P>
<P>
Morningside 68, Brea-Olinda 59 -- Keith Walker scored 35 points and finished 
with 162 points in four tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
Walker averaged 41 points a game against some of the top teams in Southern 
California and broke Capistrano Valley forward Scott McCorkle's tournament 
record of 132 points set last season. 
</P>
<P>
In the consolation championship: 
</P>
<P>
Muir 76, Los Alamitos 70 -- Guard Philip Turner scored 27 points for Muir while 
center Robert Conlisk had 22 points for Los Alamitos (6-2).

HOW BAD IS NORTH CAROLINA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven years. 
</P>
<P>
118 straight polls. 
</P>
<P>
But the streak is over. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina is among "other teams receiving votes"'in this week's Associated 
Press college basketball poll. And it's the top 25 this season, not a top 20. 
</P>
<P>
If losses to Missouri, Alabama and Georgetown didn't show that the Tar Heels 
were merely a decent team, then Saturday's 87-74 defeat by Iowa showed they 
might be worse. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat gave North Carolina a 4-4 record, its worst start in 29 seasons 
under Dean Smith and the worst by a Tar Heels team in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to have a better record at this point in the season," Smith said 
earlier this week. "But this could have been expected considering the schedule 
we've played. In fact, we could have another loss." 
</P>
<P>
Or two. The Tar Heels escaped by scoring the last 10 points against James 
Madison (and longtime Smith coaching rival Lefty Driesell) in Maui, and were 
lucky to beat Villanova the next night. But Iowa? 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkeyes were picked to finish as low as ninth in the Big Ten and, like the 
Tar Heels, lost three key players off last season's team. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because'it's Dean, people expect them to win most of the time," Iowa 
Coach Tom Davis said. "But they'll be OK by the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith, "These early games have exposed our weaknesses. That's the benefit 
of a difficult schedule. Coaches are generally aware of their team's weaknesses 
and what needs to be done. But then players have to be convinced in game 
competition against tough opponents." 
</P>
<P>
The only thing North Carolina has accomplished so far is to help build the 
confidence of the competition. Missouri, Alabama, Georgetown and Iowa are off 
to fast starts. Even Driesell's Dukes seem to have been helped by such a 
devastating defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that we're aware of North Carolina's problems," said Davis, 
whose Hawkeyes ard 6-0. "It's hard to measure exactly what it will do for us, 
but it will certainly help." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly helped sophomore Ray Thompson. He had 27 points against the Tar 
Heels and scored 32 at Iowa State -- the first Iowa player to score more than 
30'against the Cyclones -- and was named Big Ten Player of the Week. 
</P>
<P>
With Michigan's overtime victory against Duke, the Big Ten was 2-0 against the 
Atlantic Coast Conference, 12-0 overall last weekend and 19-1 last week. 
Illinois has won 24 straight at home, and is 60-2 at home during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia Coach Gale Catlett knows a gift horse, or a good shooter, when it 
looks him in the mouth. So after sophomore guard Tracy Shelton scored 36 in a 
97-93, double-overtime win against Pittsburgh, Catlett said, "He will 
definitely see the ball a few more times." 
</P>
<P>
Funny how some things change. Shelton was considered a defensive stopper on 
last season's team. But some things remain the same. It was the second str'ight 
season the Mountaineers beat the Panthers in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the victory came after two straight West Virginia losses to start 
the season and began a 22-game winning streak. This season's also came after 
the Mountaineers has lost two s'raight. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Tubbs, who picked up the blowout torch left by former Miami football 
Coach Jimmy Johnson, was told after Oklahoma beat Northeastern Illinois, 
146-51, that some thought he was running up the score. 
</P>
<P>
Said Tubbs, "We had 11 people play 10 minutes or more. What are we going to do, 
play Top Dog (the team mascot)? That's about as deep as we can go." 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: Three starters played 25 minutes or more, including one for 32. 
The Sooners have set the tempo for the Big Eight. At this timd last year, there 
were six 100-point games divided among two teams, Kansas and Oklahoma. This 
year, there have been 11 among six teams. 
</P>
<P>
When freshman Jim Dickinson, 7 feet, entered Seton Hall in the fall, he weighed 
280 pounds. Piratec Coach P.J. Carlesimo told Dickinson to shed 30 pounds or be 
redshirted this season. 
</P>
<P>
Dickinson dropped the weight, kept the same baggy shorts and last week became 
the first 7-footer in Big East history to hit a three-point shot, during an 
85-67 win over Iona. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday night's 79-74 win over Rutgers, Dickinson had eight points and 
three rebounds in 19 minutes. The victory evened Carlesimo's record to 112-112 
at Seton Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Former Michigan Coach Bill Frieder, who was booed even at home during his years 
in Ann Arbor, didn't endear himself to rest of the Big Ten recently. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Pac 10 writers, the new Arizona State coach said, "Let me 
tell you, gang, San Francisco, Seattle and Los Angeles are a hell ff a lot 
better than Champaign (Ill.), West Lafayette (Ind.) and Bloomington (Ind.) and 
all those other horsefeather towns." 
</P>
<P>
One more reason. "My wife needed a new shopping base," Frieder said. 
</P>
<P>
Frieder's departure from Michigan was well-docamented, coming before last 
season's National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament after he told 
Wolverines Athletic Director Bo Schembechler that he was leaving after the 
season for Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan went on to win the tournament under interim (now full-time) coach 
Steve Fisher. By the way, Arizona State is 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
News of Coppin State's victory over Maryland Tuesday night traveled slowly, at 
least to Hawaii. Maryland and Coppin will play in next week's Chaminade Classic 
in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
When reached by telephone Thursday, Chaminade Athletic Director Mike 
Vasconcellos said he hadn't heard about the Eagles' 70-63 upset. In fact, he 
barely had heard of Coppin State. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a small school from Maryland somewhere, I thinb," said Vasconcellos. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles could play Maryland again on Christmas Eve if both teams reach the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
From some of the remarks made after the game at Maryland's Cole Field House, 
both teams hope that happens. The Terps want another crack at the Eagles, and 
Coppin State wants another shot at Jerrod Mustaf. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Mustaf made some disparaging remarks about Coppin State, 
saying, "All I thought about Coppin State was they had a girls team. I didn't 
know they had a men's team."

BUTLER HELPS SOLVE UCI'S PROBLEMS IN VICTORY OVER AZTECS

<P>
UC Irvine's basketball team, trying to solve the mystery of its worst start in 
school history, found part of the answer Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
And it was the Butler who did it. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Butler scored 18 of his career-high 28 points in the first half and 
Justin Anderson added 15 of his 17 in the second half as the Anteaters beat San 
Diego State, 75-62, before a crowd of 2,130 at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters (2-5) broke a three-game losing streak and ended a five-game 
winning string by the Aztecs (5-3). 
</P>
<P>
The victory was a relief for the Anteaters, who have struggled without their 
top two point guards, Ben Rishwain and Rod Palmer. Rishwain is out with a 
broken finger and Palmer has an injured right knee. 
</P>
<P>
So it was Butler, a 6-7 junior, who was the center of attention Saturday night. 
Butler, averaging 13.5 points a game, scored eight points in the final 6:26 as 
the Anteaters led by as many as 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really disappointed because I hadn't played well in the last two games 
(against Cal and Colorado)," Butler said. "I thought it was the worst I had 
played." 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who also had a game-high 12 rebounds, said it was a lack of 
conditioning that hurt him in the games. He said he grew tired and faded in the 
late stages of the losses. 
</P>
<P>
"I was losing (power) in my legs," he said. "I started riding a stationary bike 
again this week and I got some of it back." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Coach Jim Brandenburg said Butler had the Aztecs chasing him the entire 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Butler played really well," Brandenburg said. "We had no answer for him." 
</P>
<P>
Butler scored 18 points, including 12 on layups and short jump shots, to keep 
the Anteaters close in a first half in which the lead changed hands 15 times. 
</P>
<P>
A free throw by freshman Craig Marshall gave the Anteaters their last lead of 
the half, 29-28, with 2:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
Then San Diego State's Michael Best made two three-pointers, sparking a 9-4 run 
that gave the Aztecs a 37-33 halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
It was Anderson who got hot from the outside in the second half. He made three 
three-pointers and a layup to help the Anteaters pull to a 48-48 tie with 12:05 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Anteaters' Don May, a sophomore reserve, took over. He had a 
three-point play and layup and Craig Marshall added two free throws as the 
Anteaters went on a 7-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a few rules tonight," said UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan. "Only a 
couple of guys (Anderson and Jeff Herdman) could shoot the jumper." 
</P>
<P>
But Butler's play inside was the difference down the stretch. He blocked a 
jumper by Best with 3:09 left and the Anteaters were clinging to a 66-59 lead. 
Best had hit two three-pointers in the previous two minutes to cut the Aztecs' 
deficit from 13 to seven. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach had been telling us that (Best) was their best outside shooter so we 
started jumping out at him," Butler said. "I just jumped out and got a piece of 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Best and Shawn Jamison scored 14 points each for San Diego State, which 
committed 19 turnovers and was outrebounded 42-31. The Aztecs made only 11 of 
20 free throws while UC Irvine made 28 of 36. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost our poise a couple of times," Brandenburg said. "We didn't do much in 
the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Nor did Herdman, UC Irvine's leading scorer (16.5 points). He had 10 points 
before fouling out with 5:13 left. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a good job," Mulligan said. "Herdman didn't have a good night and we 
still won. We came out and played hard in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan said the victory might turn the Anteaters' fortunes around. 
</P>
<P>
"If we would have lost I would have made them watch tapes of the game from 
10:30 (p.m.) until 2 (a.m.)," Mulligan said. "I reminded them of that at 
halftime." 
</P>
<P>
Butler got the message and Mulligan and the Anteaters slept well Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ben Rishwain, a freshman point guard who has been sidelined since Dec. 2 with a 
broken finger, is expected to be out until January. . . . The Anteaters are 2-3 
at home. . . . The Anteaters play at Pepperdine Tuesday night at 7:30.

ESCAPE FROM NETS BOOSTS WILLIAMS TOWARD REAL GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID ALDRIDGE, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PORTLAND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Buck Williams sat at his new locker in his new world and remembered the anguish 
of New Jersey Nets basketball the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
"I only wanted to win," he said. "I always tried to do whatever it took to win. 
If it means sacrificing my game to win, I was willing to do that. Looking back 
in hindsight, maybe it was a mistake to sacrifice my game for a losing team." 
</P>
<P>
But that's history, a chapter of ugliness that can be slammed shut, because 
Charles Linwood Williams, known to one and all as Buck before and since he was 
rebounding at the University of Maryland, has a new life in the Pacific 
Northwest. The Portland Trail Blazers just want from him what he gave his 
former employers for eight seasons: rebounding, inside scoring, tough defense. 
</P>
<P>
With Clyde Drexler, Terry Porter, Jerome Kersey and Kevin Duckworth on the 
team, the burden is no longer just for Williams, now 29, to bear. Since the 
championship days of Maurice Lucas, the Trail Blazers have been looking for a 
power forward. They tried Kermit Washington. Mychal Thompson. Kenny Carr. 
Caldwell Jones. Cameo appearances by Audie Norris and Peter Verhoeven. 
</P>
<P>
None fit the bill, so Portland swallowed hard June 24, traded its 1989 No. 1 
draft pick and oft-injured center Sam Bowie to the Nets, and pronounces itself 
better for it. The numbers bear it out; feasting 1 on opponents at home, the 
Trail Blazers have blasted out of the gate, even with Drexler missing time with 
an injured elbow. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel very good to be with a real solid franchise," Williams said, "a 
franchise that has an opportunity to win a lot of ballgames. This is what I've 
been hoping for for a lot of years." 
</P>
<P>
He has solidified the starting lineup, averaging 13.6 points and 10.5 rebounds 
per game. Portland can't be sure what it will get from the still-inconsistent 
Duckworth from night to night; thus, Williams has been a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
After Portland beat Detroit by 20 recently, Isiah Thomas was asked about the 
big difference in this season's Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
"Buck Williams," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And what else? 
</P>
<P>
"I said Buck Williams," the Piston star repeated. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just such a positive personality on this team, such a professional," said 
Coach Rick Adelman, who joined the team in midstream last season. Portland 
floundered, with Mike Schuler fired after tempests with Drexler, and with 
Drexler exchanging barbs with his teammates, most notably Kersey. The Trail 
Blazers were dispatched in the first round of the playoffs by the Lakers after 
stumbling to a 39-43 regular season. It may have been just as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have a real good chemistry on our team last year," Adelman said, 
"and I think having a type of personality and the way (Williams) approaches his 
job and everything has brought that out in guys like Porter and Duckworth and 
Kersey and Clyde." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, that means in training camp last season the Nets asked Williams 
if he would move to small forward so they could look at Chris Morris. He 
complied, providing 13.1 points and 9.4 rebounds a game, 11th best in the 
league. That doesn't mean he liked the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are you going to have one of the best power forwards in the game playing 
the (small forward)?" he asked. "I could sense right away that they sort of 
wanted to go in another direction, which was fine. Regardless of what role I'm 
going to play I'm going to be effective, and I thought I was effective last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"In this kind of business you have to have a clear-cut plan as to how you want 
to reshape your team into a contender. I don't think they really had a 
well-thought-out plan as to where they wanted to go. Year to year we went from 
one CBA player to the next and you don't really build a solid franchise going 
in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
Once, New Jersey had one of the up-and-coming teams, or so it seemed. Larry 
Brown was the coach as the Nets won 45-plus games two seasons in a row, with 
Williams, Albert King, Mike O'Koren, Darryl Dawkins and Mickey Johnson the 
core. "We were a pretty good team," said Washington Bullet assistant Bill 
Blair, an assistant coach in New Jersey at the time. "At one time we had the 
fourth-best record in the league." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of chemistry has been missing from the Nets for some time, as New 
Jersey has gone through a slew of has-beens and never-wases on the court, 
behind the bench and in the front office. One of the few constants was 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they get some players there they keep for a certain amount of years, core 
players, they'd be able to win," he said. "But we never got to a point where we 
had core players. When we did, we won, with Micheal Ray Richardson, Darryl 
Dawkins. We were together for two or three years and we won. You just can't 
throw all these different combinations in talentwise and expect everything to 
blend." 
</P>
<P>
It rankled him that there were whispers around the league last season that 
Williams was on the downhill side. Last season was the first in which he hadn't 
scored more than 1,000 points and his rebound total was his lowest by 138. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams contends things aren't always as they seem. 
</P>
<P>
"The emphasis on our team was shifted from me to some of the other players," he 
said. "I didn't get the ball as much and I just wasn't as involved as I had 
been in the past. Last year I thought I had a good season You would see it was 
a situation where I wasn't involved that much." 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers had been trying for the better part of two years to get 
Williams, and when the Nets decided to take a chance on Bowie, Portland figured 
Williams would be worth the 12th pick overall, which turned out to be guard 
Mookie Blaylock. 
</P>
<P>
But Blaylock isn't going to lead New Jersey to a title this season, or in the 
near future. Williams could help Portland, as talented as any team in the 
Western Conference, make a big step to challenge the Lakers and the Suns and 
the Jazz and all the upper echelon. 
</P>
<P>
Said Porter: "We did get rid of most of the turmoil situation we had last year 
with Kiki (Vandeweghe, traded to New York))and certain players against each 
other, saying they weren't getting enough playing time. This year we've got 
guys who understand their roles for the most part and are willing to wait and 
contribute at the time called on them." 
</P>
<P>
These Trail Blazers have rookies Byron Irvin and Cliff Robinson, along with 
import Drazen Petrovic, and all of a sudden they have good depth. Add in 
Williams with the other starting four and Portland should make noise. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Williams had been waiting for, on the island of mediocrity in the 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives him a chance to be on what he considers a good team and a team that 
has a chance to win," Adelman said. "I think he really kind of got a new lease 
on life, but he's given it to us too. He's given that to some of the other guys 
on our team. They feel like this is a different team now. This is not the same 
group that finished last year." 
</P>
<P>
Said Williams: "It was kind of frustrating at times. But it really broadened my 
horizons as a player, kind of stretched my game offensively and defensively. 
One thing about playing on a losing team is all your weaknesses are exposed . . 
. it forced me to be a more well-rounded player. It kind of stretched my 
fortitude, my maturity, so to speak. I think if I can play under those 
conditions I can play under any conditions now."

TITANS WIN, BUT THEIR PRIDE IS BRUISED A BIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

FULLERTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As proud as Cal State Fullerton is of its undefeated record -- and that's no 
small amount -- the Titans have been nearly as delighted with their average 
margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
Four opponents had gone down by an average of 24.5 points a game before 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Not one had gotten closer than 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge couldn't do any damage to Fullerton's record Saturday 
night in Titan Gym, and frankly, the Titans weren't too concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we'd have to play terrible for them to win," said Wayne Williams, the 
Titans' point guard. 
</P>
<P>
But Northridge did trim the Titans' pride -- and did a number on that margin of 
victory -- as Fullerton won, 81-70, in front of 2,600. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton led by as many as 14 in the first half -- and then let Northridge cut 
the lead to four by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans went up by 14 again in the second half -- and let Northridge get as 
close as eight points in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans might have had a much tougher time of it if not for Mark Hill, who 
made eight three-pointers, breaking his own school record of seven set last 
season. Hill made five of five in his 20-point first half, and finished the 
game with 29 points, including eight of 12 from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
But even Hill couldn't find solace in anything but the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well," Hill said. "I'm upset about that. I didn't play well. No 
one played well." 
</P>
<P>
Had the ball bounced differently in the final minutes, the Matadors still might 
have found themselves in it. Fullerton went to the line six times in the final 
two minutes and made only three shots. But they repeatedly came up with 
offensive rebounds, staving off the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Coach John Sneed took advantage of the opportunity to chastise his 
players, and to remind them about what is next -- a game against Boyd Grant's 
5-2 Colorado State team Monday night. The team is scheduled to leave at 6:45 
a.m. today for Fort Collins, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them they'd better get to bed early and dress warmly," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
That game and a game against UCLA Saturday are what Fullerton has been waiting 
for, games that will give them some idea of where they stand as a team. "These 
next few road trips will really be a challenge," Sneed said. "Our kids are 
looking forward to them." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, Fullerton point guard, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We really overlooked Northridge, looking forward to playing these other 
teams." 
</P>
<P>
The 11-point victory, though, left him disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we were winning games by an average of 24 points," he said. "I wanted 
to beat them by 24, too." 
</P>
<P>
But Northridge (3-5) battled back repeatedly, largely behind Derrick Gathers, 
who scored 22 points. Eugene Humphrey and Jemarl Baker each added 16. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the most talented team we've played all year," Northridge Coach Pete 
Cassidy said. "I'm proud of the way our guys played. They didn't back down. 
They were very tenacious." 
</P>
<P>
Sneed saw his team match Fullerton's 5-0 start of the 1983-84 season, when Leon 
Wood was a senior. That team won 13 of its first 15, and finished with a 17-13 
record. 
</P>
<P>
But like his players, Sneed was disappointed in the game itself. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of felt it coming," Sneed said. "We had a bad week of practice." 
</P>
<P>
With starter Agee Ward out with strep throat and transfer Ron Caldwell eligible 
for the first game, Fullerton used a lot of unusual combinations, Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
"I still expected us to play better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Ceballos, who has been the leading scorer in the Big West Conference, 
averaging 27.5 points a game, struggled in the first half and finished with 22 
points, a season low. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos scored only eight points in the first half. A trend is emerging: He 
has scored no more than nine and as few as four in the first half of his past 
four games. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's entire team started this one slowly, trailing by as many as three 
twice. With 11 minutes left in the first half, Fullerton led by only one point, 
16-15. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which had been playing man defense, switched to a zone, and 
Fullerton's Hill quickly destroyed it. His first three-pointer gave Fullerton a 
19-15 lead with 9:51 left. He hit another to make it 22-15. Northridge's 
Gathers cut into Fullerton's run with a steal and a layup, but Hill came back 
for a third consecutive three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's Bill Mazurie countered with a three-pointer, but then Hill hit one 
more, and the Titans led, 28-20. 
</P>
<P>
In less than two minutes, Hill had made four three-pointers without missing and 
without another Titan taking a shot, Northridge took a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, pushing the ball upcourt, quickly stretched the lead to 14 points. 
Ceballos finished off a fastbreak with a dunk. Dareck Crane, who came off the 
bench to spell Hill, pulled up off the break for a short bank shot and then for 
a 16-foot jumper, and the Titans led, 34-20 with a little more than five 
minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
But the lead didn't hold. Northridge scored 14 of the next 18 points, cutting 
the lead to 38-34 with 1:18 left off a steal and easy layup by Gathers in the 
backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, back in the game after a rest, hit another three-pointer to make it 
41-34, but Jemarl Baker retaliated with a three-pointer for Northridge, cutting 
the lead to 41-37 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Hill made three more three-pointers in the first five minutes of the second 
half, and Fullerton pulled to a 54-46 lead. Ceballos helped make it a runaway 
again with a couple of left-handed dunks off the break, completing a 
three-point play on one of them. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Fullerton had its victory, but not its favorite margin thereof. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't come out and play well," Hill said. "We've just got to play 
harder."

UCLA WOMEN PLAY TENNESSEE TODAY

<TEXT>
<P>
Tennessee, the defending NCAA women's basketball champion, will begin a series 
of games against Southern California teams today against UCLA at 2 at Pauley 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have not fared well against the Volunteers, having lost 10 of 11 
games overall and seven straight since beating them during the 1980-81 season. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee (5-1) had its 22-game winning streak snapped Dec. 9 by Louisiana 
Tech, 59-58, and was replaced by the Techsters as the nation's top-ranked team. 
UCLA (4-1) is coming off an 84-75 victory over Cal State Fullerton, during 
which guard Rehema Stephens, in her first year of eligibility after 
transferring from Colorado, scored a career-high 31 points. Stephens, a 
sophomore, averages a team-high 18.1 points a game.

Tennessee will plays at Cal State Long Beach Tuesday and at USC Friday. PETE

CAN OREGON AFFORD TO BATTLE NBA'S NINJA LAWYERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HUBBARD, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The next crashing sound that will be heard in the Pacific Northwest will be a 
bunch of lumberjacks being brought to their knees by the NBA Ninja Lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
It will not be a pretty sight -- column after column of Ninja Lawyers filing 
lawsuits that will seek more money than the Oregon state treasury will produce 
in the next millennium. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Commissioner David Stern has promised legal action that will prevent the 
Oregon State Lottery from allowing betting on NBA games, and, to use a phrase 
not currently popular in the NBA office, it is a safe bet the commissioner will 
ask for enough money to dam the Columbia River. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy will be so simple that it is tempting to ridicule those who have 
not anticipated it, but that, of course, would be in bad taste. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State Lottery officials say their very popular NFL lottery has produced 
$5.5 million this season with $1.9 million of that going to the very worthwhile 
cause and reason for which the lottery was created -- athletic programs at 
seven Oregon colleges. 
</P>
<P>
But that is a very small return on something as radical as legalized betting. 
The NBA simply will force Oregon officials into the courtroom, and legal fees 
obviously will be large. At what point will the average Oregon lumberjack 
figure it is not worth it to fight a legal battle that could cost more than the 
$3.5 million officials project will be produced by the NBA lottery? 
</P>
<P>
What if legal fees threaten to increase taxes? Oregon voters have been 
reluctant to approve any tax increase, which is one of the reasons the lottery 
exists. The original plan to aid state college athletic programs was to add a 
one cent tax to beer and cigarettes, but voters rejected that proposal. Too 
expensive. So the lottery was instituted. Some things are sacred in Oregon -- 
particular reasonably priced beer and smokes. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA will do a lot of posturing, saying that by spending a large amount of 
money, it has marketed the game and made it popular and that it is illegal for 
Oregon to profit from the NBA's investment. And that may be true. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon will counter by pointing out the NBA is not bothered by the high rollers 
gambling on NBA games in Nevada, and has never instituted legal action to 
prevent that type of gambling. And that is a legitimate point. 
</P>
<P>
But the real issue of whether Oregon has a right to sponsor a lottery that 
allows betting on NBA games probably will not be addressed because the simple 
fact is the NBA is determined to make it unprofitable for Oregon citizens to 
bet on NBA games. The Ninja Lawyers are poised, ready to attack. It will not be 
a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
Rocket Coach Don Chaney is not happy with Sleepy Floyd, who continues to pout 
about Chaney's decision to switch him from point guard to shooting guard. Floyd 
played so poorly (two of nine from the field, four points, six rebounds, four 
turnovers) in the Rockets' 99-94 loss to the Nets last week there were some 
suggestions in Houston that he went in the tank to make the Rockets look bad 
against Net Coach Bill Fitch, who was fired by the Rockets two seasons ago. 
Floyd's only comment when talking about the situation: "I'm a point guard." 
</P>
<P>
That irritated Chaney, who said, "If you put a guy into the lineup and tell him 
to play center, he should play it hard. I don't want to hear this stuff about 
how you belong in another spot. This is a golden opportunity. Most guys would 
love to be in a position where they can just go in and shoot the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Chaney has made it clear that when Mitchell Wiggins, who is on the injured list 
with a sprained knee ligament, returns in the next four to six weeks, Floyd 
will return to backup shooting guard. The Rockets probably would be willing to 
trade Floyd. But he is an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season and, 
because of his poor play, his trade value is down. 
</P>
<P>
Celtic center Robert Parish offered the first backhanded compliment Patrick 
Ewing has received this season. "He's improved," Parish said. "He's got a lot 
more confidence. But he's shooting every other time down the court. So of 
course his numbers are going to be better." 
</P>
<P>
It seems Parish has missed the point. Not only is Ewing shooting more, but he's 
also converting 56 percent. Parish probably would like to see Eddie Lee Wilkins 
shoot more often, but it doesn't seem that would be the best way for the Knicks 
to win. Of course, Parish probably isn't that interested in devising a plan to 
help the Knicks win. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors have begun in Sacramento that King Coach Jerry Reynolds may be replaced. 
Gregg Lukenbill, one of the owners, said that is absurd at this point. The 
Kings have been battered by injuries, most notably to Pervis Ellison and Ralph 
Sampson. Lukenbill said those two need to recover. "We can't even form a 
judgment about what kind of team we've got until we get Ralph and Pervis back," 
Lukenbill said. "Even then, it would take 15 games or so." Fifteen games? 
Reynolds has to be pleased with that overwhelming vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
It has become popular for players to wear those nylon shorts under game shorts, 
and, technically, the reason is the shorts keep hamstring muscles warm. But 
that is not the only reason. Some players say they wear them to be fashionable. 
Maverick forward Adrian Dantley says he accepts neither reason. "The only 
reason guys wear them is because they have a fat butt or their thighs aren't 
real toned," Dantley said. "Rick Mahorn used to wear them in Detroit because he 
hoped it would compress his rear end a little. It's just like a lady wearing a 
girdle."

DON KING, BOB ARUM -- WOULD THEY BE MISSED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL JACKMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Impertinent questions: 
</P>
<P>
If promoters Don King and Bob Arum disappeared from the fight scene, would 
anybody even bother dragging the river? 
</P>
<P>
With an average of 36,000 no-shows at their last two home games, how soon will 
it dawn on New York Jets owner Leon Hess that his is one sorry operation? 
</P>
<P>
Because 225 million homes throughout Europe and Asia have access to National 
Hockey League games already, how soon will it be before the league goes 
hemispheric? 
</P>
<P>
Considering the football season Occidental College had -- whipping up on rival 
Whittier, 7-0, and finishing 7-2 -- isn't it now apparent that Dr. John B. 
Slaughter left the chancellor's job at Maryland to be with a winner? 
</P>
<P>
And, in the light of subsequent events, can you believe Slaughter still won't 
admit the hiring of basketball coach Bob Wade might have been a mistake? 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible a gent won $3 million playing baccarat at The Mirage in Las 
Vegas the night before the Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran snooze? 
</P>
<P>
Do any of those dudes looking for a football coach at Navy -- admirals, 
commanders, captains and a guy from the math department -- have a say, or are 
they yes-men to the athletic director? 
</P>
<P>
With Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia Tech, Wake Forest, Clemson and Maryland 
down in the rankings from No. 20 to No. 90, is this the weakest ACC basketball 
season in decades? 
</P>
<P>
Can anyone think of a bigger sacrifice than the one Kent Hrbek just made, 
accepting a third-best offer of $14 million for five seasons so he could play 
ball in his native Minnesota? That's at least worth a statue outside the 
ballpark when he's gone. 
</P>
<P>
Do I remember right or are the contracts free-agent ballplayers are dragging 
down these days outstripping what the Orioles and Yankees were purchased for in 
the '70s? 
</P>
<P>
Does anyone seriously believe that of the 300 or so Division I college teams 
playing hoops only 11 deserve to be on probation at the present time? 
</P>
<P>
You mean it took a gang of archeologists digging for a couple of months to 
discover Babe Ruth's old man ran a saloon where the center field fence of 
Camden Follies will stand? John Steadman, a Baltimore Evening Sun columnist, 
told me that at least a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
With news that the Suns are going to toss in about $15 million toward the 
construction of a new arena in Phoenix, Ariz., can we now expect the Orioles to 
let us know how much they're tossing into the pot for the new ballpark? 
</P>
<P>
With a strike war chest well in excess of $100 million, is there any doubt the 
baseball owners plan a hard-line approach in basic agreement talks with the 
players? Of course, they'll cave in as usual. 
</P>
<P>
The Pac-10 is dropping its season-ending conference basketball tourney, which 
is staged over a long weekend, because the players are losing too much class 
time. Believe it? Now the NCAA tourney, that's a different story. It only goes 
for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Has any tennis player ever pulled a bigger fade than Mats Wilander, dropping 
from three Grand Slam titles in '88 to just one quarterfinal appearance in the 
big four this year? 
</P>
<P>
Has anyone noticed ol' Spunky (Earl Weaver) has his Gold Coast Suns up to 
within nine games of first place in the Southern Division of the Seniors 
Baseball League? What do you mean, no? 
</P>
<P>
Isn't the reason John Thompson schedules games against Hawaii-Loa, Florida 
International, St. Leo's and Shenandoah Conservatory of Music to prove that he 
does what he damn well pleases at Georgetown?

THE NHL; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN IT COMES TO PATRICK, THERE'S NO DIVISION 
</P>

It seems Craig Patrick can't get away from his association with the Esposito 
brothers, or the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
Both are ironies that have cropped up as a result of his hiring last week as 
general manager and coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick was the general manager of the New York Rangers when he was replaced by 
Phil Esposito. When he was hired by the Penguins, Patrick replaced Phil's 
brother, Tony. 
</P>
<P>
Both of Patrick's affiliations in the NHL have been with teams in the Patrick 
Division, which of course was named after his grandfather, Lester. 
</P>
<P>
New York Ranger coach Roger Neilson is unhappy about his December schedule, 
which has his team playing seven home games, including two during the Christmas 
holiday week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather be on the road at that time," he says. "Being home for the players 
during Christmas is too distracting." 
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey Devils reportedly brought in a consultant recently to inspect 
the ice at the Brendan Byrne Arena. It seems the Devils are concerned about 
their poor home record. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Barry Jones, director of ice operations for the Spectrum in 
Philadelphia, examined the rink and reported findings of three major problems 
in the ice production at the Meadowlands. Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello 
was secretive about the whole thing. "It was nothing that can't be fixed," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Now all they have to do is fix their home record, which was 6-8-1 after 15 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Coffey is one of the team leaders on the Pittsburgh Penguins, and not just 
because he's one of the oldest players at 28. In Coffey's case, it's because of 
something he picked up from a teammate while winning three Stanley Cups in 
Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fortunate to play with one of the greatest players in the game, Wayne 
Gretzky, and he was the type of guy who, when things went bad, took his 
leadership onto the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"He tried to show by example when things were down and the team needed a lift. 
Playing with him for seven years in Edmonton, you could always count on him, 
and that's what I'm trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota coach Pierre Page after a recent loss: "Our bodies were in the right 
place, but our minds were somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago defenseman Doug Wilson likens playing in the NHL to being a 
professional musician. 
</P>
<P>
"If a concert pianist thinks of every key he is going to hit, he's in trouble. 
Same in hockey. When you start thinking instead of reacting, then you've got 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't taken Peter Klima long to settle in Edmonton. Klima has purchased a 
home outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't live in a hotel," he says. "I don't like renting. I need a home. I 
lost mine in Czechoslovakia when I was 19 years old. I need my home, my couch, 
my TV, my carpet. My three dogs will be moving in, too." 
</P>
<P>
Klima has a great Dane, a German shepherd and a doberman. 
</P>
<P>
When the NHL's all-star game in Pittsburgh this season was scheduled for a 
Sunday afternoon rather than the usual Tuesday night, league officials had to 
reschedule 241 games. 
</P>
<P>
Former New York Islanders defenseman Denis Potvin is hyping Ottawa as an 
expansion site, and offers this anecdote. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I drank from the Stanley Cup (1980), I drank thirstily," says 
Potvin, who played his junior hockey in Ottawa. "I was drinking, drinking, 
drinking and when I got to the bottom of the Cup, I saw the word Ottawa. I 
couldn't believe it. I was really impressed." 
</P>
<P>
Ottawa appears on the Stanley Cup 10 times -- four by the Silver Seven and six 
for the Senators.

<DATELINE>
<P>
OCEANPORT, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took a wild ride on a spooky horse, but Julie Krone finally appreciated a 
story of star gazing her mother told her. 
</P>
<P>
"She was training a jump pony," Krone said, resting her broken left arm in her 
lap as she sat cross-legged on he couch. 
</P>
<P>
"He was nasty. He wheeled under her, and she fell off." Krone sprang from the 
couch and sprawled on the floor -- "just like this." 
</P>
<P>
Her eyes flashed blue fire. Her voice was excited. 
</P>
<P>
"There she is -- it was night time -- lying on her back. She said to me, 
'There's nothing worse than looking up at the stars and hearing your horse 
gallop away.' " 
</P>
<P>
At 26, Krone is the winner of more than $26 million in purses and one of the 
best jockeys racing today, man or woman. Only, today she's not racing. She's 
nursing a shattered arm back to health, answering mail and waiting until March, 
when she probably will be able to ride again. 
</P>
<P>
The night after Thanksgiving, she was on a 2-year-old colt named My Rolin at 
the Meadowlands, where she is the all-time leading rider. The colt ducked from 
a shadow, put on the brakes, and Krone went flying. Her own horse kicked her 
toward the rail, another one hurdled her cleanly, and she was trampled by a 
third horse. 
</P>
<P>
Then, she thought about her mom's story. Its implications were astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I felt like," she said, still lying on her living room floor, all 
4-foot-10 and 100 pounds of her. "Two horses jumped over me. I was laying on my 
back. I looked at one arm, and it was in an 'L' shape. I looked at the other, 
and it was an 'S' shape. I knew this couldn't be right. 
</P>
<P>
"Then my legs started going," she said, knocking her knees together. "I looked 
down at my legs, and I thought, 'Thank God, at least they're working.' Then I 
looked up at the lights, and I said, 'Boy, my mom sure was right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Later, doctors found that Krone had broken the big bone in her left forearm and 
dislocated her shoulder, elbow and wrist. Now, she has a metal plate in her 
arm, a 6-inch-long stitch mark covering it, and she'll wear a removable cast 
for another six weeks. Four or five more weeks of therapy will follow. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like forever before the ambulance came. The ground was so cold," she 
said. "It was really weird lying there like that, on the ground, when I'm 
usually five feet above it. 
</P>
<P>
"I hurt real bad for about 45 minutes. I was crying. I remember every bump in 
the road on the ride out." 
</P>
<P>
At Hackensack, N.J., Medical Center, where she was treated by Dr. Seth Kane, 
she received 27 bouquets of flowers, "and then I stopped counting." The mail 
continues to inundate her. 
</P>
<P>
"I get so much I can't open them all anymore," she said, pulling piles of mail 
from a shelf below her Pee Wee Herman and Freddie Krueger dolls. A few 
envelopes fell onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the letters come from little kids. Most of them come from people I 
don't even know," she said. "How can you read through letters like these and 
not feel better?" 
</P>
<P>
Krone's recent reading also included a particular issue of the Star, one of the 
supermarket tabloids that specialize in celebrity sex scandals and aliens from 
outer space. There was a brief story about her in it, recounting her run-ins 
with other jockeys. It made her sound like a roller derby queen, throwing 
elbows and forearm smashes as she circled the track. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's hilarious," she said. "I'm finally a star. I made the Star." 
</P>
<P>
But what about her reputation? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried. People don't believe that stuff," she said. "I'm not like 
that. Two times I've been in fights that I didn't start. 
</P>
<P>
"The last one, I started," she said, lowering her eyes, her voice muffled in 
her blonde hair. 
</P>
<P>
That fight, on Sept. 23, earned her a 20-day suspension and $600 fine. She hit 
jockey Joe Bravo with her whip as they rode side-by-side during the race, then 
got into a shoving match with him later. Stewards called it unsportsmanlike. 
She admits it, and she's ashamed of it. 
</P>
<P>
"My only defense was that I had gone 22 days straight, racing both night and 
day. I'd race in the day in New York, then at night at the Meadowlands. . . . 
Eat, sleep, race. Eat, sleep, race. I was at the end of my line. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, Joe Bravo keeps coming in and coming in on his horse. I hollered at him 
to do something, and he just let his horse come in. He was putting other horses 
in jeopardy . . . and I smacked him. 
</P>
<P>
"I paid for it. That stretch took five years off my life." 
</P>
<P>
Krone has been riding by herself since she was 3. Her mother, a dressage rider, 
taught her to ride back home on the farm in Michigan. Julie started racing at 
fairs when she was 15, and she rode her first money-making winner in 1980 at 
Tampa Bay Downs. It was her 11th mount as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
Her childhood memories are like precious possessions to her, and she's got a 
trunk full of them -- pictures, papers and keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, oh," she said, opening the lid. "We could be here for hours." 
</P>
<P>
First, there's an 8-by-10 glossy of 15-year-old Julie, breaking from a gate for 
the first time on a racehorse. 
</P>
<P>
"That's me, there," she said, pointing to a white cap in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Next, there's a 7- or 8-year-old Julie sitting on a fancy little pony, and 
she's decked out like a cowgirl. 
</P>
<P>
"I broke him myself," she said. "Do you believe that?" 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there's a 4- or 5-year-old Julie sitting next to an old tree, back on 
the farm. 
</P>
<P>
"The branches were so big, you could walk on them like a sidewalk," she said. 
"I loved that tree." 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, she's 5 again, not a care in the world. Then, she's 26, treating 
herself to facials and a hairdo, going to antique stores, shopping with her 
boyfriend Jerry, writing letters, killing time while her arm mends. 
</P>
<P>
"When I come back, I'd like to ride in the Kentucky Derby -- about the third 
choice," she said. A high-pitched laugh escapes involuntarily, and her cat 
jumps off the couch. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, I could have ridden in three or four Derbys, but the horses were going 
to be really 'Ppphhhht.' 
</P>
<P>
"When I come back, I'll be happy riding anything."

ROOKIE LICHTI PLAYS LIKE VETERAN 
</P>

<P>
Todd Lichti's adjustment from Stanford superstar to NBA rookie was tougher than 
most, mainly because veteran coach Doug Moe of the Denver Nuggets has a 
reputation for treating first-year players as nonentities. 
</P>
<P>
Since Moe took over the Nuggets in 1980-81, the club had a penchant for 
drafting failures. Among Denver's top choices this decade, only center Blair 
Rasmussen, a first-rounder from Oregon in 1985, has made a significant 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
Lichti, a 6-4 guard who was the 15th player selected in the first round, had to 
buck tradition and prove he belonged with the big boys. And playing 16.1 
minutes per game, Moe is not prejudiced about using Lichti. 
</P>
<P>
"All heard before I came to camp was that coach Moe didn't like rookies," said 
Lichti, whose Nuggets play host to the Sacramento Kings Friday night. 
"Consequently, I came to camp in real good shape because I wanted to get off on 
the right foot. 
</P>
<P>
"Then Doug started yelling at me, and I got down. Then I realized he was 
yelling at everyone. It's just something you have to get used to. He's 
different than any coach I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Lichti, the all-time scoring leader at Stanford, earned his spurs with an 
intensity and consistency that produced 20 records with the Cardinal and 
All-Pacific 10 Conference selection four consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing similar desires to the NBA, he has averaged 7.6 points while shooting 
.558 (58 for 104) from the field and .778 (35 for 45) from the line. That 
projects to 22 points over 48 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In only his ninth pro game, against Houston on Nov. 18, he made 7 of 9 shots 
and scored a career-high 19 points in 23 minutes. Against Portland on Dec. 2, 
he had 15 points, four rebounds and six assists in 21 minutes in his finest 
all-around performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look at Todd as a rookie," Moe said, "because he can play. People say 
I don't like to play rookies, but over the years I've had a bunch of does. I 
think Todd was the player drafted highest since I've been here. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd is the type of player who has an edge over other guys because he can 
compete. He's mentally tough. Rookies usually don't have competitiveness and an 
understanding of how hard you have to play in this league. 
</P>
<P>
"It just isn't as tough in college," Moe added, "so a lot of rookies come in 
soft. But Todd showed from the start that he's very competitive. He plays very 
tough defense and is very competitive." 
</P>
<P>
As with most NBA rookies, Lichti has had his ups and downs. The 134-114 loss to 
the Warriors on Wednesday was a microcosm of the growing pains endured by a 
first-year player. 
</P>
<P>
Lichti played tough defense in containing Mitch Richmond for three quarters, 
and he also connected on 4 of 6 shots, but the Nuggets guard paid a stiff 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Playing 21 minutes, he had a team-high four turnovers and also missed two free 
throws. Unlike Chris Mullin, who played with poise and confidence, Lichti 
seemed tentative'and unsure of his ballhandling. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest adjustment is in decision-making," he said. "It's knowing when to 
shoot, go to the hole or pass. It takes time to get that down pat, especially 
when you're adjusting to not being the go-to guy every time." 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, Lichti was a franchise player ever since he jumped from Mt. Diablo 
High in Concord, Calif., to the Cardinal starting lineup as a freshman. Over 
four years, he averaged 18.8 points. Only Sean Elliott of Arizona scored more 
in Pac-10 history. 
</P>
<P>
Those who watched Lichti excel in college predicted even more success for the 
tireless athlete in the pros. The wide-open Nuggets offense seems perfect for 
his style as compared to the more structured college game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the NfA is better suited to me," Lichti said. "I like our running game 
and getting the ball in the open court. I struggled early, but I feel I'm 
improving. It's very tough adjusting to only playing 16 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
It's a matter of perspective. Those accustomed to the Nuggets and Moe contend 
that Lichti should be thankful for that many minutes. They don't begrudge him 
the playing time but indicate that it's unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd is coming along fast because he's getting the playing time," said Fat 
Lever, the shooting guard who plays ahead of Lichti. "He's playing more than 
any rookie I've seen around here, but he's earned it by playing hard and well. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd's big plus is his athletic ability. I saw him play on TV a lot in 
college, so he really had nothing to prove to me. I knew he could do it, 
because he has the mental ability to go with his physical skills." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran forward Alex English is similarly impressed. "Todd hustles, jumps, 
shoots and plays defense," English said. "He's just, a real good all-around 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't take him long to show us he can play. I think he's going to be a 
real good one in this league. In time, he'll be an exceptional player because 
he has the knack to keep going after it." 
</P>
<P>
It's that desire that caught Moe's eye in the preseason workouts. Hardly a 
typical kid from the suburbs, Lichti endeared himself to Moe with his reckless 
abandon. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly didn't know how good he'd be," Moe said. "I never saw him play in 
college, but our scouts really liked him. We really needed a guard, because I 
want to cut down the minutes for Lever and (Michael) Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"Todd reminds me of Dan Majerle (Phoenix), because he's hard-nosed and goes all 
out. He has a feel for the game. He can shoot it and take it to the hoop. He 
just needs seasoning and maturity."

USD ENDS ALL DOUBT QUICKLY; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: THE TOREROS TAKE A 32-13 FIRST-HALF LEAD ON THE WAY TO AN 
EASY, 71-45 VICTORY OVER STEPHEN F. AUSTIN.

<P>
In the University of San Diego's Saturday night shoot-around with Stephen F. 
Austin State, the Toreros shot a hole in the idea any team can beat another in 
college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
SFA never had a shot. USD's 71-45 victory in front of 713 at the USD Sports 
Center was, for all intents and purposes over in . . . well, pick your spot. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing, 2-0, USD scored five points in a row. It may have taken the 
Toreros four minutes 10 seconds to record their first point (perhaps because of 
a week layoff for final exams) but once they got untracked, they had no 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring streaks of 14-0 and 7-0 helped USD establish a 22-point lead, its 
biggest of the first half, with 17 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The amazing thing was that USD had scored just 32 points, the Lumberjacks 10. 
It took a three-point basket at the buzzer by Jeff Williams to give SFA 13 by 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Had USD not been shooting so poorly early -- the Toreros made just six of 20 
shots (30%) in the first 6:02 -- it might have had one of its better first 
halves ever. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, SFA had one of its worst in 64 years. After Tim Holloway scored the 
game's first basket at 17:30, the Lumberjacks did not score again for another 
4:45. 
</P>
<P>
That paled in comparison with the 6:42 nap it took after its fourth point. With 
6:02 left, Norman Schippers' 15-foot jumper cut USD's lead to 19-6. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, John Jerome made two free throws and a layup, and Pat 
Holbert sank a three-pointer to give USD a 28-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
It was pretty much over from there. 
</P>
<P>
After four consecutive road losses, USD needed a victory to begin its 
eight-game home stand. USD is 3-5 and plays four more nonconference games at 
home before opening West Coast Conference play Jan. 6 against Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more, it needed to avoid a loss to a team that has yet to win this 
season (0-6) and has lost eight in a row over two seasons, two shy of the 
school record set in 1941-42. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been on the road, and we've been beat up pretty bad," USD Coach Hank 
Egan said. "We needed a win." 
</P>
<P>
Said Wayman Strickland, who had one of his best games since switching to point 
guard this season, "We need to get well on this home stand." 
</P>
<P>
SFA was a good short-term remedy, but was it a case of the Toreros playing 
well, or did the Lumberjacks play that badly? 
</P>
<P>
Said Egan: "I think we played well at times. I think defensively we played 
better than we have. They're a young team, no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
SFA has six freshmen, three sophomores and just four upper classmen. That 
makeup reminds Egan all too well of his teams the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In the two-plus years since making the NCAA Tournament, USD is 22-42. SFA is 
20-42 over that same period after making the National Invitation Tournament in 
1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
But USD is clearly on the upswing. The Lumberjacks . . . well, they were picked 
to finish last in the Southland Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The statisticians at courtside probably set a personal record putting together 
the numbers after the first half. It isn't hard to figure out a game that's 
32-13. 
</P>
<P>
USD made twice as many shots (12-6) and had nearly twice as many rebounds 
(19-10). The Toreros made seven of eight free throws to SFA's zero of zero (USD 
committed only three fouls). SFA had 11 turnovers to just six for USD. 
</P>
<P>
The only statistical area the Lumberjacks were even was in three-point field 
goals. Both teams made one of three. The second half was closer mainly because 
SFA made five three-pointers and shot 46% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 45 points was a USD opponent low for this season, as was the 13 in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome, averaging 19 points per game, led all scorers with 22 points. Gylan 
Dottin added nine and Kelvin Woods eight as Egan substituted freely in the 
second half.

GULL HOPES ARE DEALT A SETBACK; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: KEVIN BRADSHAW LOSES HIS COOL AND USIU LOSES A GAME, 
113-107, TO WRIGHT STATE.

<P>
Gary Zarecky, U.S. International coach, hopes he doesn't look back at Saturday 
night's 113-107 loss to Wright State as the game that tipped the balance on 
what he and the Gulls figure can be the second winning season in the 11-years 
the school has played Division I basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was not only frustrating because USIU overcame a mysterious point 
given to Wright State by the official scorer and a 17-point deficit with 9:30 
remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
No, what really made this loss hurt most was who was largely responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky and the rest of the Gull team have made no secret that guard Kevin 
Bradshaw is both the foundation and cornerstone of the USIU team. 
</P>
<P>
Those weighty expectations and the fact he has been making a name for himself 
with his 30 points per game average may have finally taken their toll on 
Bradshaw, who joined USIU after three years in the U.S. Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"He feels that it was not a fair situation," Zarecky said. "But he can't put 
himself in the right or wrong position. He has to put himself in a position to 
be above that. He's having a hard time. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the strategies -- pulling on the shirt, words that go back and forth 
between players and down right physical abuse -- are not kosher. What they are 
is psychological ploys to get a player out of his game." 
</P>
<P>
USIU (3-8) kept pace with Wright State (5-2) and trailed 61-59 at halftime. But 
then the Gulls began to fall apart in the opening minutes of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Wright State out scored USIU, 12-4, to start the half. And when Paul Wilson 
scored twice to pull USIU within 73-67, but Bradshaw's frustrations began to 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
He was called for a foul under the basket and showed his displeasure with the 
call by tossing the ball away from the referee. 
</P>
<P>
Technical. And Wright State turns the mistake into a six-point play. Well, 
actually they turned it into a seven-point play. For some reason, the official 
scorer decided that somewhere there was a three-point shot scored by Wright 
State despite the fact no player had taken a shot from outside 12-14 feet. 
</P>
<P>
By the time USIU got the ball back, it was trailing, 82-67. Wright State scored 
four more points and USIU was down, 86-67, and appeared to be out. 
</P>
<P>
But the Gulls rallied after trailing, 99-82, with 9:30 remaining. USIU 
outscored Wright State, 18-2 and trailed just 101-100. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson later made two free throws to pull USIU within, 109-107 with 55 seconds 
remaining. The Gulls got the ball back three seconds later on an offensive 
foul, but Bradshaw was stripped and Wright State pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson led USIU with 30 points and Steve Smith added 27. Bradshaw finished with 
23 points but was seven of 26 from the field. Sean Hammonds scored 26 points to 
lead Wright State. 
</P>
<P>
"Kevin Bradshaw has to better deal with his position," Zarecky said. "He is a 
target. He's getting a reputation as one of the better players in the region. 
Kevin is feeling the pressure."

ABOUT WINE: THERE IS A BUMPER CROP OF GOOD BOOKS FOR WINE COLLECTORS TO HARVEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometime soon my library of wine books will exceed in size and weight my 
collection of wine. The latest wave of literary efforts about uvas frumenti is 
a tsunami of vinous verbiage. 
</P>
<P>
As a certified wine loony with more than 300 cases of wine to my name (not to 
mention the name of my next of kin), the growth of my bookshelves in recent 
weeks indicates as much interest in gabbing about wine as in consuming it. 
</P>
<P>
Wine has always provoked lots of people to put quill to parchment and fingers 
to keyboard, from Horace to Hemingway and the Bible to Buchwald. Wine books 
abound, with so much already said about this subject that each new publishing 
season sparks in me a skeptic's caution along with a wine lover's curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, much of the wine literature was a rehash, featuring listings of 
Cru Beaujolais, the 1855 Classification and a lot of retelling of myths that 
are apocryphal but which sound good. 
</P>
<P>
Much as I'd like to decry all the new writings about wine as repetitious, a lot 
of the new stuff is very good, ostensibly because there are more and more 
intelligent and witty people contributing to the literature. 
</P>
<P>
I recently lavished high praise on Hugh Johnson's new book "Vintage" (Simon 
&amp; Schuster, $39.95), the book of the year for wine buffs. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a few other books on wine that are worth considering for yourself or 
for a dedicated collector. All are recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Wine With Fish by David Rosengarten and Joshua Wesson (Simon &amp; 
Schuster: $19.95, 298 pages). 
</P>
<P>
 News and social commentary magazines are having a field day with the 
Conventional Wisdom (CW, as Newsweek abbreviates it), and the authors of this 
groundbreaking book open their text with a charming excursion into the CW, with 
examples of wines that work with various foods and wines that don't. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Ensrud's 1984 book "Wine With Food" righted some of the wrongs about 
wine/food pairings. Rosengarten and Wesson, with a sense of joy and wit, leap 
headlong into the subject with a multilayer approach. 
</P>
<P>
They note that some wines complement the dish they are served with, others 
offer a contrast, and that choosing a wine to go with a particular main 
ingredient in a dish is impossible unless all the ingredients in a recipe are 
known. 
</P>
<P>
So recipes are included, along with a periodic quiz (to see if you're paying 
attention) and a concluding 50-page summary of the wines of the world 
categorized by style and type, by expected flavors and aromas and even vintage 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
This is an energetic and original work written with verve that is worth being 
in the library of every wine lover who eats now and then. 
</P>
<P>
 The Story of Champagne by Nicholas Faith (Facts on File: $21.95, 246 pages). 
</P>
<P>
 Faith first came to my attention with a superb narrative history book on the 
Bordeaux region called "The Winemasters" (Harper &amp; Row, 1978), in which the 
socio-political elements of the region were woven almost National Enquirer-like 
with the wine and the scandals that have been carefully soft-pedaled throughout 
the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
In this new work, Faith uses a less gossipy style, but with the tone of a 
romanticist and the precision of a historian he captures the flavor of the 
Champagne region and discusses the relationships between the people who are its 
headliners. 
</P>
<P>
There are no in-depth tasting notes (Tom Stevenson's book "Champagne" is better 
in this regard). Also, there is only a brief discussion of the production 
techniques that help make the Serena Sutcliffe book, also called simply 
"Champagne," so worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
In Faith's compact, readable effort, the true wine lover will find a lot to 
savor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making Sense of Wine by Matt Kramer (William Morrow: $16.95, 207 pages). 
</P>
<P>
The wine writer for the Oregonian in Portland explores some new ground in this 
book, which is essentially a series of essays on various subjects strung 
together under the concept that they are wine-related. And much of what Kramer 
says is interesting and worth chewing on, even if some of it is not 
particularly new and a few of his "facts" are still on-going debates. 
</P>
<P>
I did, though, agree with a number of his conclusions, such as the importance 
of place in the consistency of a wine, and one line impressed me: 
</P>
<P>
"Now, numerous wine critics contend that the 'who' of wine making is more 
important than the 'where' of wine growing," which is followed by a backhand 
slap at Christian Moueix for putting his picture on the label of the expensive 
Dominus red wine. 
</P>
<P>
A minor criticism of the Kramer book: Some it clearly was written for the 
dedicated enophile, other parts for the novice. Thus there are portions of it 
that will bore the true wine lover, and other parts that appear to be so arcane 
that the novice will wonder what's what. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, though, I enjoyed the tone of this work, even if a few of the 
references are a bit of a stretch (in spots he compares wine to boxers, to 
music and even to Greek myth). It is recommended for those who have gone past 
the primer stage and own a budding cellar. 
</P>
<P>

California's Great Cabernets by James Laube (Wine Spectator Press: $29.95, 460 
pages). 
</P>
<P>
This is the most controversial wine book of the printing season, and expectedly 
so. When someone takes a strong stand, ranking the quality of various wines and 
wineries, it's like hanging out a target and handing you the bow and arrows. 
</P>
<P>
And there is plenty to question about this book, but there is a lot to praise 
too. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Laube, who lives in the Napa Valley, has done a monumental 
amount of research and has compiled here, in addition to a plethora of tasting 
notes, a serious appraisal of Cabernet Sauvignon in California that contains a 
lot of new material. 
</P>
<P>
Laube's tasting notes appear to be pretty good, all things considered, though I 
feel in some cases a lot of scores are too high and a number of them are way 
too low. There is also a good in-depth look at vintages from 1933 through 1988, 
at microclimates (though there are some shortcomings here) and a series of 
valuable appendixes. 
</P>
<P>
But the concept of the book -- creating a ranking for Cabernet -- is next to 
impossible. Moreover, the book ignores differences between wines that are 
either vineyard designated or always "estate bottled" (whatever that term means 
these days) and those wines that come from 20 or 60 different growers who 
change from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not comprehensive, which is bothersome to those who would like to 
track such old-line wineries' Cabernets as Dehlinger, De Loach, Dry Creek, 
Parducci, Hacienda, Domaine Laurier, Foppiano, Rodney Strong, Grand Cru, 
Fetzer, David Bruce, Concannon and Pedroncelli. 
</P>
<P>
Laube, asked about these omissions, said that "one of the yardsticks for any 
evaluation of Cabernet is how the wines age," and he didn't feel these 
properties' wines had aged well. 
</P>
<P>
Also, omissions of newer wineries such as Folie a Deux, Cain, Clos Pegase, 
Cosentino, Domaine Michel, and Kistler was based, he said, on not enough 
experience with them. However, the goal was to update the book every three 
years and all such wineries will be considered for inclusion in the future. 
</P>
<P>
One final problem I have with the book is that Laube gives a suggested 
collectibility price, which I feel in many cases is simply too high and doesn't 
reflect the actual resale value. 
</P>
<P>
(Moreover, I'm personally irritated when anyone suggests that wine ought to be 
bought as a commodity to be sold for profit. I feel wine should be bought, aged 
and enjoyed. Call me Pollyanna. On the other hand, Laube doesn't recommend this 
practice; he merely accepts that it happens.) 
</P>
<P>
All in all, however, I like the Laube book and feel it should be in every wine 
collector's library, preferably next to the Cabernet section in the wine cellar 
along with a corkscrew and a glass. It is a marvelous reference work for those 
truly dedicated to Cabernet and its myriad of stories. 
</P>

<P>
Wines and Vines of California by Gary L. Peters (Star Publishing Co.: $15.95, 
184 pages). 
</P>
<P>
This new addition to the vinous literature from a newcomer to wine writing is 
an excellent example of a dedicated wine lover and geographer taking a personal 
look into wine. 
</P>
<P>
This book is a winner on two levels. As a basic primer it offers a simplified 
look at modern wine production techniques without getting too technical, 
emphasizing the relationship between quality wine and the region in which the 
grapes grow. It also dissects the various regions of California, specifying 
which varieties grow best in which regions. 
</P>
<P>
For those just getting into wine, this book is excellent, though the lack of an 
index makes it less useful as a reference. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plain Talk About Fine Wine by Justin Meyer (Capra Press: $9.95, 160 pages). 
</P>
<P>
 Any wine writer would have mixed emotions about a wine maker entering the 
writing field, just as wine makers should be irritated if I left my computer to 
commercially produce wine. 
</P>
<P>
Yet I have known Justin Meyer for 15 years, since he left the Christian 
Brothers to operate Franciscan Vineyards and subsequently struck gold on his 
own with Silver Oak Cellars, and I know him to be one of the brightest and most 
thoughtful men in the business. 
</P>
<P>
And though I liked this book quite a bit because of some marvelous insights 
into wine, by and large it is poorly organized and misses the mark as a unified 
work. Moreover, its "talk" isn't that plain, because in some areas, Meyer goes 
into such technical detail I wondered who would care. 
</P>
<P>
This book is intended as an introduction to wine, "to make you as comfortable 
(with wine) as you are with food." Alas, a better book to accomplish this is 
Leon Adams' superb, "The Commonsense Book of Wine" (McGraw Hill, 1986, $15.95; 
paperback $9.95). 
</P>
<P>
In fact, I recommend the Plain Talk book for those who have already read Adams' 
work and seek more depth because, as previously mentioned, there is a lot of 
good stuff here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beringer, a Napa Valley Legend by Lorin Sorensen, with Fred Beringer (Silverado 
Publishing Co.: $39.95, 198 pages). 
</P>
<P>
 This handsome picture-laden coffee-table book dedicated to one of the oldest 
wineries in the Napa Valley is not just a public relations man's dream. It is 
also a loving look at the growth of the Napa Valley throughout the last 
century, and because Fred Beringer participated in the project, historic photos 
from the family album, never before published, are part of this rich tapestry. 
</P>
<P>
Photos are a huge element of this gorgeous book: The first 42 pages are 
pictures; the text begins on page 43. A marvelous compendium to consider for 
any wine lover. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A number of other books published within the last year are worth consideration 
for wine lovers, though the following are rather specialized and may be lost on 
novices. These are books for the in-depth wine reader. 
</P>
<P>
The Wines of the Graves by Pamela Vandyke Price (Sotheby's/Wine Appreciation 
Guild: $45, 388 pages). 
</P>
<P>
 Graves is that district in Bordeaux that produces harder, less accessible red 
wines than those of some of the other regions of Bordeaux, such as Pauillac and 
St. Julien. It also makes classicly lean white wines blended from Semillon and 
Sauvignon Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
It is a district whose wines are not particularly popular on the West Coast, 
although they are becoming better known and truly dedicated wine lovers collect 
the classic red wine of Chateau Haut Brion as well as the great, age worthy 
white wines of Chateau Laville Haut Brion and Haut Brion Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the limited interest in those wines here, I cannot recommend this 
book (at its price) as a gift for the general reader. Still, by itself it is a 
remarkable work and worth a look for the amazing depth of research Price has 
done. 
</P>
<P>
The text weaves in personal relationships of the people of the region with 
history and a great deal of knowledge about production. If every region of the 
wine world were so covered, the wine lover would be rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sherry and the Sherry Bodegas by Jan Read (Sotheby/Wine Appreciation Guild: 
$45, 192 pages). 
</P>
<P>
I adore Sherry, that product of Jerez in Spain that has been imitated but 
rarely duplicated. I serve it often with soup, as an aperitif, after dinner 
with and as dessert, and as a soothing before-bed soporific. 
</P>
<P>
And thus I welcome more and more exposition on the subject of the region and 
the people and the wine and its history. This book has more of all that, 
written by one of the world's experts in Sherry. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the price of this book (though it is graphically and production-wise a 
handsome effort) appears pretty high for a subject so few people know much 
about. At $25, it would have been a fine addition to any wine lover's library. 
</P>
<P>
Chilean Wines by Jan Read (Sotheby/Wine Appreciation Guild: $39.95, 176 pages). 
</P>
<P>
The wines of Chile are beginning to make a huge impact in the United States, 
and will become even more important in the coming years. A reason for this is 
the price-quality relationship: you can get $5 Cabernets from Chile right now 
that are as good as any wines two and three times the price -- a reason 
California wine producers should be wary of price increases. 
</P>
<P>
This book, though expensive, is a good introduction for those interested in the 
wines of a region that is as yet untapped. Potentially, Chile represents one of 
the strongest threats to California wine yet seen, and this attractive book 
explains why. 
</P>
<P>
(As a side note here, at least half a dozen California wineries, recognizing 
the potential for Chilean wines in the U.S. market, are in negotiations to 
either make wine in Chile or import Chilean wine made to their specifications.) 
</P>
<P>
The Taste of Wine: The Art and Science of Wine Appreciation by Emile Peynaud 
(Wine Appreciation Guild: $29.95, 258 pages). 
</P>
<P>
This most scientific approach to wine tasting should be a must for everyone in 
or entering the wine making or selling field. But for the average wine 
collector? Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that Peynaud, founder of the University of Bordeaux Centre of 
Oenology, is one of France's greatest wine makers and he approaches this 
subject with such hard-nosed precision that the average reader may well be 
shocked at the almost medical school demands he expects from professional wine 
tasters. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard Amerine and Edward Roessler of the University of California at Davis 
did much this same thing in their book, "Wines: Their Sensory Evaluation," in 
the 1950s. (A 1983 revision was published by W.H. Freeman.) 
</P>
<P>
Peynaud's work adds depth to the subject. But it's not a casual reading book; 
only for the serious student of wine evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1986 Sterling Three Palms Vineyard Red ($18.50): Exceptional 
fruit and richness in this ageworthy wine make it a good candidate to stash in 
the cellar for another five or 10 years, but this is the first of the Three 
Palms wines that also shows enough softness and fruit to drink early. A great 
wine and not badly priced, considering the prices of its competitors.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: EVEN MORE USES FOR WHITE VINEGAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I've always known white vinegar can be useful for many things, 
but never realized there are hundreds of uses. I'd like to pass on a few. 
</P>
<P>
Did you know that most decals and stickers on windows can be removed by putting 
vinegar on them? Paint a few coats on, let soak for a few minutes and the 
stickers will wash off easily. 
</P>
<P>
My husband's lunch box started getting a terrible odor, so I dampened a piece 
of bread with vinegar and put it in the lunch box overnight. I washed it the 
next morning and was surprised to see how fresh-smelling it was. 
</P>
<P>
One more thing I did with vinegar was remove new deodorant stains from my 
husband's shirts. All I did was rub the area before washing them. I'm so happy 
with it I always keep a gallon handy. 
</P>

<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have a shelf full of cookbooks and always had a tough time 
remembering which one contained that scrumptious recipe I discovered six months 
ago. Now I have an address book on the shelf with my cookbooks and use it as a 
directory. I list my favorite recipes in alphabetical order and note the name 
of the cookbook it's in and the page number. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BEVERLY, Dallas 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Your hints have saved me lots of money and now I'd like to share 
one. When your celery gets wilted and limp, don't throw it away. Just put the 
stalks in cold water and they will crisp up again. Use right away or keep in 
the fridge for a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
If there's too much to use this way, don't throw it out. Dice it up and cook it 
in a little water until it's just tender. Cool, divide it into small amounts 
and freeze. It's great to have on hand for soups and casseroles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HAZEL, Aberdeen, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: We keep a magnetic note pad on the refrigerator. The pads with 
the magnet attached are very expensive, so after buying one I pulled the magnet 
off the cardboard and glued it on a regular note pad. I've now used the same 
magnet for over a year and saved quite a few pennies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LIZ, Ohio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Pot holders sure get dirty quickly in my home. It seems they are 
always in the washing machine. 
</P>
<P>
A friend suggested the following to me. When taking the pot holders out of the 
dryer, spray them liberally with a fabric protector and then use them. They 
stay cleaner a lot longer.

COOKING WITH MEMORIES BY LAURA BRODY (THE STEPHEN GREENE PRESS/PELHAM BOOKS:

<TEXT>
<P>
A rabbi once advised Brody that a Jewish mother's duties include "keeping the 
memories," and Brody has obliged with this warmly written collection of 
remembrances and recipes. 
</P>
<P>
Chapters range from "Good-bye," a touching description of sitting shivah (an 
observance following the death of a loved one), to a lighthearted essay on 
"Casseroles -- or What Are You Trying to Hide?" Brody blends childhood memories 
with experiences in raising her own youngsters and writes with such sensitivity 
that it is not surprising to hear her say her next book might be a novel with 
recipes. 
</P>
<P>
"Cooking with Memories" is being promoted in conjunction with Jewish book 
month, which extends to Hanukkah (December 24). Although the book is 
predominantly Jewish in theme, there is a chapter inspired by memories of a 
friend's Christmas cookie baking and followed by a recipe for springle. 
</P>
<P>
Other tempting recipes include a brandied bread pudding made with leftover 
croissants, rugelach, honey cake and, on the savory side, stuffed cabbage, 
chicken soup, baked brisket and what Brody considers "the best brisket 
sandwich." BARBARA HANSEN

<P>
Not much information on Vietnamese cooking has been published, so those who 
have become acquainted with this light, vegetable-laden cuisine in restaurants 
should find this book interesting. The recipes cover many of the dishes 
commonly seen in Vietnamese eating places, among them pho bac, which is a north 
Vietnamese beef-noodle soup; cha gio (spring rolls), curry-flavored beef stew, 
grilled beef with lemon grass, charcoal broiled pork and, for dessert, fried 
bananas. 
</P>
<P>
This is a luxury book in the Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang tradition, with 
expertly styled photographs. Handsome, expensive cookbooks are common now, but 
at least this one supplies information that is not easy to find elsewhere.

A collection of menus by such noted food personalities as Hubert Keller, Alice 
Waters, Laura Chenel, Rene Verdon and Jeremiah Tower could not fail to draw 
interest. What makes this book even more worthwhile is its charitable purpose. 
A portion of the proceeds will be turned over to Project Open Hand. Founded in 
San Franciso in 1985 by Ruth Brinker, this organization provides two meals 
daily to AIDS patients who are unable to market and cook. 
</P>
<P>
The menus are divided according to season and cover such diverse situations as 
an unintimidating dinner for friends, an eastern European dinner, an ambitious 
dinner for four and a simple southwestern dinner for a summer's eve. This is 
not a fancy book, but it offers plenty of substance. BARBARA HANSEN

"In order to really understand modern cooking in America, it is essential to 
follow the food fashions of France," writes Levy. French cooking today covers a 
broad range, from classic entrees to rustic dishes to inventive, modern 
cookery, she states. And it may incorporate such foreign sounding ingredients 
as star anise, cumin and filo dough because inventive French chefs believe in 
using ingredients from other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
This analysis prepares the way for a varied collection of recipes. In the 
chicken category alone, dishes range from a lavish chicken with foie gras sauce 
and mushroom puree to chicken saute with curry-coconut sauce and grilled 
chicken with cilantro-lime butter and green beans. 
</P>
<P>
Levy writes her recipes with plenty of detail to help the cook. A resident of 
Santa Monica, she lived for years in France, where she was associated with the 
La Varenne cooking school as editor and also in Israel. She has written 10 
cookbooks. 
</P>
<P>
This book concentrates on main dishes. Chapters cover poultry, meat and 
seafood, but not accompaniments and desserts. BARBARA HANSEN

The art of hosting is eloquently imparted by the authors, owners of New York 
Parties Catering, not just for a coffee-table feast for the eyes but as a bible 
for entertaining. Catering parties for the rich and famous for more than 14 
years, whether dinners range from 2,000 or an intimate group of 10, Savoca and 
Brawley share hosting guidelines to ensure a smooth event. 
</P>
<P>
No matter if the host is doing all the cooking himself, the pictures in the 
book trigger a great number of ideas on how to present food and create the 
right ambience. The authors stress impeccable planning. This is noted in the 23 
favorite party designs and menus featured in this big book. Some memorable 
examples include: a Chinese buffet by the pool, a Japanese picnic at the 
Botanic Garden, a Thai dinner at home, a tented spring wedding and a charming 
Victorian tea. The tea chapter for instance even includes a description of 16 
different teas plus a guide on how to properly brew tea. 
</P>
<P>
There are 170 innovative recipes from these lavish parties such as Italian 
seafood salad, turkey tamales with red chile sauce, breast of duck with 
chartreuse, a roast goose with apple stuffing and chocolate pate with pistachio 
cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Although the color illustrations include many table settings and arranged party 
rooms, many of the recipes also are photographed. A ways and means chapter 
helps you achieve your goal of entertaining successfully within budget. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the book, there are hundreds of important serving and decorating 
tips, unique and daring ideas, etiquette guidelines and thoughtful suggestions 
to make your guests comfortable. MINNIE BERNARDINO

BERRIES: CULTIVATION, DECORATION AND RECIPES BY MARY FORSELL (BANTAM BOOKS:

There's a lot to be said and done with berries, nature's most cherished food 
and adornment. An accomplished writer on gardening and design, Mary Forsell 
says it all and more in this lusciously illustrated book. This complete 
compendium on the little round fruits covers a wide range of berries -- from 
the most common eating strawberries, raspberries and blackberries to their 
wilder, or more exotic cousins like lingonberries, cloudberries and extends 
farther to berry bearing plants like the pepper berries, holly and rose hips 
for ornamental applications. 
</P>
<P>
Gathered from chefs around the country, all the recipes provided make 
wonderful, not forceful, application of the berry. Presented with 
mouth-watering photos, there's red raspberry tart studded with golden 
raspberries from Julia Orenstein of Pacific Heights Bar and Grill in San 
Francisco, grilled duck breast with raspberry sauce from Tom Grego of Ventana 
Inn in Big Sur, a tangy blackberry chutney from Oouida Dorr. Forsell shares 
design techniques to achieve a professional look in berry decorations. She 
illustrates how dazzling wreaths, bouquets, topiaries and garlands can be 
created by mixing berries with foliage, grapevine, flowers, herbs and other 
natural elements. 
</P>
<P>
The book also has a chapter on berry gifts, discussing preserving and drying 
for potpourri and bouquets, and storing edible berries for jams. Another 
section features cultivating a berry patch as well as designing your garden. A 
source information chapter provides an extensive list of suppliers of berry 
plants, jams, jellies, decorations and delicacies. MINNIE BERNARDINO

THE JEWISH AMERICAN KITCHEN BY RAYMOND SOKOLOV (STEWART, TABORI &amp; CHANG: 
$30, 192 PAGES, ILLUSTRATED). 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
I have a soft spot in my heart for the Jewish-American kitchen, having been 
raised in a neighborhood where the rich smells noodle kugel, hamantaschen and 
chicken soup wafted through open tenement windows. I loved the honey cake that 
Becky Schwartz, who lived on the fourth floor, used to bake and send up to our 
apartment for us to sample now and them. Her kichlach weren't bad, either. So I 
could easily translate my pleasant experiences to Sokolov's upbringing as a 
Jewish boy who watched his mother -- or was it grandmother -- (I have no idea 
because Sokolov, unfortunately, doesn't say) cook the Jewish food Americans 
cook. In fact, the absence of a personal touch in a subject so highly 
subjective is baffling. The back cover blurb mentions that Sokolov ate his 
first Jewish meal in 1941 but remembers none of it. (Sokolov is editor of the 
Wall Street Journal's Leisure and Arts Page and a food columnist for National 
History magazine). He spent of his childhood in Paris, which may explain the 
absence of any experience with American-Jewish cooking. Who could blame the 
fellow? 
</P>
<P>
So you get an impersonal, clinical but erudite account of what Jewish food is 
and how it evolved from many cultures of Jews who lived throughout the world 
and made their final home in America. Jews from Palestine (now Israel), 
Romania, Montevideo, Eastern Europe, Yemen, have all contributed to the Jewish 
food Americans know and love. For those who never quite understand the dietary 
restrictions of religious Jews, there is a solid and lengthy explanation 
showing the bond between religion and food in Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
"Steak with maitre d'hotel butter is not kosher, obviously. But it is also 
forbidden to consume meat and milk foods at the same time even when the foods 
themselves don't come into physical contact with each other. You can't eat 
bread and butter side by side with chicken. Or, to put it more generally, 
whichever you eat first, milk or meat, determines what you can consume for the 
rest of the meal." 
</P>
<P>
The recipes, punctuated by a stream of wonderful photographs (as you would 
expect from coffee-table book publishers) are on target. You'll find what you 
expect to find: the familiar, favorite and true knishes, chopped liver, chicken 
soup, lox and eggs, roast chicken, tsmmes with meat, boiled flanken, stuffed 
cabbage, kugel, kasha varnishkes, mamaliga (Romanian cornmeal mush), gefilte 
fish, matzo balls, challah, rugelach, cheesecake, strudel and a good egg cream 
(chocolate soda and cream). 
</P>
<P>
And I can't wait to try them. ROSE DOSTI

CLASSIC TECHNIQUES OF ITALIAN COOKING BY GIULIANO BUGLIALLI, (FIRESIDE PRESS:

Here is the Italian version of Jacques Pepin's French La Technique. Fine and 
dandy. We needed one. And no one could do it better than Buglialli, an Italian 
historian, with an unusually rich perspective of cuisine. Italians, who have 
been blanching, wrapping, sifting, carving, boning, stuffing, slicing, sieving 
longer than any Western European culture, are the forerunners of modern 
culinary technicians. Indeed, Renaissance paintings by mannerist 
(gastronome-painters who were followers or students of Michelangelo), depict 
them. Famous artist-cooks of the Baroque period composed banquets filled with 
ice sculptures, sugar works, napkins folded into complex animal and geometric, 
and floral shapes. 
</P>
<P>
Tricianto, a treatise on the Art of carving was printed in Venice in 1580, and 
remains a valuable reference work to this day, Buglialli reminds us. So once we 
are given an incredibly detailed description of equipment for the Italian 
kitchen, we are taken through the step by step techniques for using the 
half-moon chopper, blanching and grinding nuts, preparing ravioli and passing 
food through the food mill. 
</P>
<P>
Then we get to the frittatas, and other doughy preparations for batters, pastas 
risotti. You get details about preparing food in clay or paper bags (which go 
back to Renaissance cooking), larding meat, grilling, boning, stuffing, 
handling fish and shellfish, galantines, yeast doughs, molds and aspics, 
pastries and ice creams. The book is actually a must for any serious home 
library where cooking is actually done or talked about. ROSE DOSTI

JUDGE MAY BACK CITY IN POLICE DISPUTE; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: A RULING ON THE FORCED IMPOSITION OF A UNION CONTRACT FOR LONG BEACH 
OFFICERS HAS BEEN POSTPONED UNTIL A HEARING JAN. 22. 
</P>

<P>
A court hearing last week did little to end the contract shoot-out between city 
management and the police union, although a temporary truce will remain in 
place for another month. 
</P>
<P>
While she indicated during a Los Angeles hearing on Thursday that she will side 
with the city, Superior Court Judge Dzintra I. Janavs postponed until Jan. 22 a 
ruling on whether city management can impose a new contract on the 610-member 
police union without the union's consent. In the meantime, the city has been 
barred from carrying out the new contract, which the union complains is being 
forced upon them. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Janavs' ruling, however, an appeal is expected. "I'm sure this will 
get decided by the state Supreme Court," union attorney Mike Hannon said. "This 
is probably a year or two away from resolution," observed Mike Tracy, president 
of the Long Beach Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding that the city had not given the union sufficient notice that it was 
going to declare an impasse in the nine-month-old bargaining talks and adopt 
its final contract offer, Dzintra ordered the city to give that offer to the 
union to allow the membership to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Although that opens the door for an agreement that would end the labor dispute, 
Tracy predicted that the contract would be overwhelmingly rejected unless the 
city makes substantial changes. 
</P>
<P>
"We will make some modifications (in our position) and see if there is any 
movement from them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City human resources Director William Storey held out little hope of further 
bargaining by the city, saying the city's offer could not change unless the 
City Council modifies its position. 
</P>
<P>
The court case revolves around the City Council's decision last month to adopt 
the city's final contract offer. Arguing that such action violates the 
so-called evergreen clause of their last contract, the union asked Janavs to 
prohibit the city from imposing its final contract position. 
</P>
<P>
The evergreen clause stated that the old contract would remain in effect until 
either July of this year or until both sides agreed upon a new contract, 
whichever was later. "Now they just pull the rug out from under us and say we 
didn't mean to do this. They shouldn't be allowed to do that," Hannon argued to 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Such evergreen clauses, which the police union has had in its contracts for a 
decade, are rare. Attorneys said there are no pertinent California court 
rulings, and the two sides disputed interpretations of federal labor law cases 
that touched on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Janavs, saying she had "given this case an awful lot of thought," agreed with 
the city's arguments that federal labor law indicates that an open-ended 
contract can be terminated by either side, as long as reasonable notice is 
given. She decided, however, that the city had not given reasonable notice 
because it declared an impasse only a week after announcing that it planned to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
City management insists that staffing changes are necessary to run the Police 
Department more efficiently and has demanded a number of changes in personnel 
policy that have been bitterly fought by the union. 
</P>
<P>
"They may ram it down our throat, but we'll throw it back on them," declared 
Tracy, who reiterated that the union is not planning any job actions. Instead, 
he said the union is launching a publicity campaign aimed at rallying public 
support for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the matter at this point in time has to be taken to (the public) . . . 
We're not going to go away. We're not going to roll over and say this is a 
great deal and say we're taking this."

PANEL BACKS POLICE IN TEST OF FREE SPEECH

<P>
Citing the First Amendment, the city's Public Safety Advisory Commission has 
recommended that Police Chief Lawrence Binkley stop reprimanding officers who 
express criticism of him or the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"This suppression of communication undermines morale and commitment to the 
department and violates the officer/employee rights as provided in the First 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution," says the recommendation that commission 
members approved Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Several officers have been reprimanded this year for expressing their views in 
newspaper stories or letters to the editor. 
</P>
<P>
The trend of investigating and reprimanding officers who are critical of 
Binkley or department policies drew the attention of members of the advisory 
commission, which decided to take up the issue at a meeting last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Police Officers Assn. has protested Binkley's policy as a 
violation of employees' First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, an officer and a dispatcher -- both disciplined after their views 
were published in the Press-Telegram -- filed separate lawsuits against 
Binkley, claiming he violated their "constitutional right of free speech." 
Another officer gathered 270 signatures from fellow officers on a petition 
advocating "freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
Binkley has argued that officers with complaints should go through the chain of 
command and not turn to the press or public to air their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members, who issue recommendations to the City Council on public 
safety matters, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"While employee discipline is appropriate when released information jeopardizes 
investigations, prosecutions, safety of officers . . . it is not appropriate 
when used to repress employees for expressing criticisms of department policies 
or management," commission members said in their recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also recommended that the Police Department create a press 
relations office to help arrange interviews, provide emergency interviews and 
promote "favorable relations with the media." The proposed public information 
officer should be there to assist, but "not take the place of talking to the 
chief," other department heads or the officers themselves, commission member 
Ron Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Commission member Norm Benson, a retired police lieutenant, cast the only vote 
against sending the recommendations to the City Council, but he later explained 
that his vote reflected a disagreement over procedure, not content. 
</P>
<P>
Benson said after the meeting that he wanted to hear comments from police union 
President Mike Tracy and others, who were en route to the meeting Wednesday. At 
the request of another commissioner, the group took a vote without waiting for 
Tracy to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to wait and hear what he (Tracy) had to say," Benson said. "I'm 
for the (recommended) new policy." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy and other union leaders said in interviews that they were pleased with 
the commission's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are restricted from blowing the whistle, if there is only one voice 
coming from the Police Department, then we have a police state," Tracy said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Dan Mallonee, who is on the union's board of directors, called 
Binkley's policy oppressive. "The wall went down in Berlin, but it went up in 
Long Beach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ernie Kell said in an interview that he sides with the commission. "I 
disagree with the chief on this particular issue. The officers have a right to 
express criticism if they are not jeopardizing a case," Kell said Thursday. "If 
they want to verbalize their opinion, they have that right." 
</P>
<P>
Officer Ray Faraca, who spearheaded the petition drive advocating "freedom of 
speech," told the commission: "I know that by speaking to you tonight I won't 
be in the top 10 (of the department)." But, he said, "They will not violate my 
First Amendment rights. I'm still a citizen. I still pay my taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Sid Solomon, representing Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, an activist group, 
commended the police officers who signed the petition. 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, union leaders have complained that some officers are being 
harassed if they are perceived as not being loyal to Binkley. Within the past 
two months, a handful of officers have also received identical letters 
questioning their "attitude and loyalty" and suggesting that they might be 
transferred. 
</P>
<P>
In one letter signed by Cmdr. John Bretza, an officer was told: "A positive 
attitude and department loyalty are important ingredients of a police officer. 
Your negative attitude and mannerisms hinder not only your performance but the 
performance of your co-workers. . . . Your attitude and loyalty are having a 
detrimental impact on the overall effectiveness of the watch. . . . Your 
progress will be monitored on a daily basis. In order to enhance your 
performance, an environmental change is being considered."

ACTING COLLEGE PRESIDENT GETS POST FOR REAL

COMPTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warren A. Washington, who since September has been acting president of Compton 
Community College, has been named president by the college's Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Washington succeeds Edison O. Jackson, who resigned Sept. 1 to become president 
of Medgar Evers College in New York City. The Compton board, which did not 
solicit any applications for the presidency, reached its decision Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
A 14-year veteran at the college, Washington was dean of continuing education 
and college development before being named acting president. Trustee Legrand 
Clegg called the new president an "indefatigable worker." 
</P>
<P>
"What I really like about him," Clegg said, "is that . . . he's very sensitive 
to the concerns of the entire college family -- the students, the faculty, the 
administration, our patrons, as well as the board. That's why I think he had 
such widespread and enthusiastic support." 
</P>
<P>
The trustees, Clegg said, were happy with Washington's performance so far and 
saw no reason to take the time to conduct a search for other candidates. "I 
felt, and I think the others did too," Clegg said, "that it would be beneficial 
to give him the full authority of his office as opposed to having him serving 
in an acting capacity." 
</P>
<P>
Washington's contract will run until June, 1992. 
</P>

LONG BEACH AUTO MALL DREAM FADES;

<P>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's dreams of boosting its sales tax income with the development of an 
auto mall near the 405 Freeway have fallen into a gaping pothole with the 
defection of four Long Beach car dealers to neighboring Signal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The four dealers join two other Long Beach dealers who had previously signed 
with Signal Hill to move to that city's planned auto mall, which will open just 
a few blocks from the Long Beach mall. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no dealers left to go into the Long Beach mall at this point in 
time," observed Gary Cooper, president of Long Beach Nissan, one of the four 
dealers who recently decided to say goodby to Long Beach and jump into Signal 
Hill's camp. 
</P>
<P>
The dealers said they broke off their negotiations with Long Beach because 
Signal Hill offered them a sweeter financial deal and land that will be ready 
for construction years before the Long Beach site. 
</P>
<P>
"Signal Hill can produce. Long Beach hasn't produced," declared Lars Eriksson 
of Jim Gray Volvo, another of the dealerships that is abandoning Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Shick, Long Beach's community development director, said the city has not 
given up hope of establishing an auto mall, but may use the collapse of the 
talks to revamp the development proposal for the 90-acre site to include major 
retail stores. "We really have the ability to start fresh," said Shick, who was 
hired at the beginning of the year, well after negotiations had begun with 
local dealers. "We may have the potential for a better deal . . . for the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
The chief gripe of the dealers revolved around Long Beach's requirement that 
they guarantee the city a certain amount of annual sales tax income to pay off 
the bond the city would have had to float to finance the mall development. If 
the project's sales tax fell short of that amount, the dealers would have had 
to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Over in Signal Hill, the Redevelopment Agency wasn't asking for such 
guarantees. Moreover, Signal Hill was willing to sell the four dealers land at 
$10 a square foot, compared with the $13 a square foot Long Beach was asking. 
Commented Eriksson, "When you have the ability to go right next door and not 
guarantee the sales tax . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Now clustered along Long Beach Boulevard and other older, declining commercial 
strips, the dealers have been anxious to move to flee light rail construction 
and neighborhood crime and get closer to a freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The six Long Beach dealers will fill up Signal Hill's auto mall, contributing 
an estimated $2 million a year in sales tax revenues to that small city's 
treasury. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no robbing of dealers," said Tim O'Donnell, Signal Hill's assistant 
city manager. "It just boiled down to who could put the best deal together in 
the quickest amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
Although Long Beach has long talked to the dealers about tax guarantees, 
Eriksson said that until a recent meeting with city officials, "we were under 
the impression they would find other guarantees" for the mall bond. After the 
meeting, at which dealers said they were also informed the Long Beach land 
prices were increasing from $10 to $13 a square foot, the dealers approached 
Signal Hill and struck a bargain within a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
The Signal Hill City Council earlier this month approved exclusive negotiating 
agreements with the dealers, allowing 120 days for the two sides to arrive at a 
final deal. Both Signal Hill and Long Beach plan to pay for their auto malls 
with bonds and money from selling land to the dealers. But because two-thirds 
of Signal Hill has been declared a redevelopment zone, that city could use an 
existing redevelopment bond that is paid off with increases in property taxes 
from throughout the zone. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach's case, the city planned to float a new bond just for the mall, 
which would have been repaid from sales tax income from the mall. "The city 
can't put up all the money and take all the risk," said Shick of the guarantee 
requirement. "That's not the way the world works." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the guarantee demand drove the Long Beach dealers across city 
lines, Shick said she is talking to larger dealers with manufacturers' backing 
who would not be bothered by such a requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach had not acquired all of the land for the mall and will put the 
purchase on hold until it lines up other dealers or retail stores, Shick added. 
</P>
<P>
The city would be interested in putting retail stores on the site, she said, 
because those sales are not as prone to cycles of ups and downs as car 
dealerships, and because retailers and developers would probably be able to put 
up enough money of their own to eliminate the need for a city bond.

"Bobby Darin!" 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Young looked quickly for his passenger's reaction as he maneuvered his 
prized white '57 Cadillac Eldorado convertible along a favorite, tree-lined 
road in the Santa Cruz mountains. 
</P>
<P>
This sometimes elusive rock maverick knew that his mention of Darin -- in 
answer to a question about which early rock mavericks he most identified with 
-- would catch the reporter by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Though Darin, who died in 1973, will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame on Jan. 17, he was terribly under-rated for years by the rock community 
because he turned in his rock 'n' roll shoes for a tuxedo in 1959 and went off 
in pursuit of a Sinatra-like pop stardom. 
</P>
<P>
Given Young's reputation for sly humor, it was hard to know if he was kidding 
by citing Darin. The dark glasses he was wearing kept his eyes from offering 
any clue. 
</P>
<P>
'I'm serious," he finally said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Dylan was always a model, but Darin was really an extremist," he 
continued. "That guy went through more changes than anybody. Think of the swing 
from 'Queen of the Hop' to 'Mack the Knife.' That was off the wall completely, 
but he managed to make two classics. It was like he was two different people." 
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of Darin makes sense because Young, too, has caused fans to 
scratch their heads at his own changes. He has made such radical shifts in 
style that he has sometimes seemed to be four people. 
</P>
<P>
But what about his Darin appreciation? Did he see the excellence in Darin's 
work in the early '60s or was he as puzzled by Darin's changes as many of 
Young's fans have been by his movements in the '80s? 
</P>
<P>
Young paused. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to say I saw what was going on with Darin back then, but it's not the 
case," he said, a touch sheepishly. "When 'Mack the Knife' came out, I thought 
he had lost his mind. So I understand it when people think I've lost my mind 
too." 
</P>
<P>
He chuckled as the car picked up speed on the two-lane road. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a longstanding reputation as one of rock's most restless figures, Young 
has lived on a 2,000-acre ranch in this area -- about an hour's drive south of 
San Francisco -- for almost half of his 44 years. 
</P>
<P>
It's in this lovely, largely isolated region -- at the ranch and on these 
lonely mountain roads -- that he has written dozens of the deeply introspective 
songs that have made him second only to Dylan as the most consistently 
challenging of the still-active rock singer-songwriters to emerge in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a side of me that is always restless and it's probably something I 
feel more than ever because there is so much to do and there is less time to do 
it than there was yesterday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I do like to be on the move a lot, but I love it so much here . . . my 
ranch, my family, the whole thing. It's important to have a home base -- and 
this is mine." 
</P>
<P>
Like Dylan, Young is a man of constant change -- someone who once, too, 
relentlessly avoided interviews and who alienated fans by such dramatic changes 
of musical style. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just that Young walked away from such admired groups as the Buffalo 
Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young to start a solo career, but 
that he stepped away from the highly successful solo path that had produced two 
widely acclaimed Top 10 albums -- 1970's "After the Gold Rush" and 1972's 
"Harvest." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than repeat the richly accessible and evocative textures of those 
carefully crafted albums, he began moving toward a more radical, experimental 
rock posture -- highlighted by "Tonight's the Night." 
</P>
<P>
That brilliant 1975 statement of disillusionment was so dark and intense that 
radio programmers rejected it and even Young found it difficult emotionally to 
later perform the songs in concert. Though shifts like "Tonight's the Night" 
cost Young sales, he remained a critical favorite throughout the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
By the '80s, however, even critics began wondering just what was going on. His 
new musical directions were often as extreme as "Tonight's the Night," but the 
results weren't always as clearly gripping. Some observers even suggested that 
a contempt 
</P>
<P>
for the music business was behind the changes of directions that were sometimes 
so severe they bordered on perverse: a techno-pop album, then a rockabilly 
collection, then some country tunes. 
</P>
<P>
While outsiders shook their head in disbelief, Young simply insisted that the 
shifts were an essential part of the creative process for him. He had to pursue 
his artistic instincts. Eventually, he said, he and his audience would reunite. 
</P>
<P>
And, true to his words, he has rebounded this year with an album, "Freedom," 
that recalls the gracefulness and insights of the most prized '70s material. 
Not surprisingly, the Reprise Records work is shaping up as the most acclaimed 
album of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't caught on with the public yet (it peaked at No. 35 on the Billboard 
charts) because radio play has been minimal, even on rock stations that once 
championed Young. 
</P>
<P>
One reason may be that much of the pop-rock community has become so skeptical 
of Young that even the glowing reviews aren't enough to make them buy his 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Radio is a touchy point with Young. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate all this (nonsense) about radio formats," he said, sharply. "If 
something doesn't fit a station's image or sound, then it doesn't get played. 
And there are certain stations that won't play me, regardless of what the 
record is like. They don't want to play music that their parents listened to 
because it doesn't fit their image. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I am boxed in with these classic rock artists, which is really sickening 
-- to have worked all this time and be boxed in like that . . . and cut off of 
alternative radio and college radio, just because I've lasted so long." 
</P>
<P>
The radio outburst aside, Young seemed especially comfortable as the old 
Cadillac purred along the winding road -- maybe even a tad amused that the pop 
world has suddenly began heralding him again. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people seem to think I made a lot of those records as a joke or 
something -- just to be different," Young said. "But the truth is you go where 
the music takes you. I never wanted to lose public favor or critical acclaim. I 
always would like that, but it's purely coincidental when it comes. I live each 
album while I'm doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of like a bad friend, I guess, because I'm into one thing so much 
that you think, 'Oh, this guy is committed to this for life,' but then I'm gone 
and I'm into something else the same way. 
</P>
<P>
Young's new album, which offers many of the classic Young strains, is the only 
new studio release this year to get maximum, five-star ratings from both 
Rolling Stone and England's highly regarded Q magazine. Even the Village 
Voice's stingy Robert Christgau gave the album an unqualified A grade. 
</P>
<P>
Though frequently described as a "political" album, "Freedom" is about the 
search for fulfillment and integrity in both personal and social settings. 
</P>
<P>
"Rockin' in the Free World," which opens and closes the album, looks at the 
irony between the promises of "freedom" and the casualties of human 
indifference. Sample lyrics: 
</P>
<P>
 There's colors on the street 
</P>
<P>
 Red, white and blue 
</P>
<P>
 People shufflin' their feet 
</P>
<P>
 People sleepin' in their shoes 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a warnin' sign on the road ahead 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of people sayin' 
</P>
<P>
 We'd be better off dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't feel like Satan 
</P>
<P>
 But I am to them 
</P>
<P>
 So I try to forget it, any way I can. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Hangin' on a Limb," he looks at the issues of commitment in relationships: 
</P>
<P>
 When the melody 
</P>
<P>
 Through the window called 
</P>
<P>
 It echoed in the courtyard 
</P>
<P>
 And whispered in the halls 
</P>
<P>
 He played it through the night 
</P>
<P>
 She knew he had to go 
</P>
<P>
 There was something about freedom 
</P>
<P>
 He thought he didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, in view of the hail of applause, "Freedom" wasn't the album that 
Young had planned to release. He came within days of releasing another album -- 
a much harder-edged collection titled "Eldorado" (which has been released in 
Japan). 
</P>
<P>
"I had turned it into the record company and it was all ready to go when I 
realized that the album wouldn't have had a chance," he said. "People were so 
used to getting 'surprises' from me that if I put out this real heavy kind of 
speed-metal album, they would just say, 'Oh, there's crazy Neil, just doing 
something strange again.' They wouldn't see the album for what it was. They'd 
just stop at the style." 
</P>
<P>
So he stopped Warner Bros. Records from releasing the album, returning instead 
to the studio to record some other tunes. He ended up with 32 tracks, 
representing both new songs and a few that had been written years ago but left 
off earlier albums because they didn't fit the mood of the albums. 
</P>
<P>
The key song in bringing the "Freedom" album's theme together, he said, was 
"Rockin' in the Free World." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot to be discouraged about in the world today, but it's hard not to 
be hopeful, too, because of all that is happening," he said. "Who ever believed 
all this would happen in Eastern Europe? I'm going to do some acoustic shows in 
Europe soon, and I can't wait to get over there and see it up close." 
</P>
<P>
The reporter had assumed when Young picked him up at a restaurant just outside 
of Woodside that they were headed to Young's ranch, but Young just kept 
driving. He did stop at a beach just south of Half Moon Bay for the 
photographer to take some pictures, but then he returned to the mountain roads, 
stopping only for a sandwich at a rural market where he has a running tab. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear Young preferred talking in the comfort of his car and the road. 
The questions dealt with the affect of outside influences on the creative 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, you ignore positive criticism because it's usually not 
constructive," he said, matter of factly. "It tells you that you are doing a 
good job, which you already feel or you wouldn't be doing it. Sometimes a 
negative review will get you though. Certain things stick with you, especially 
nagging little things." 
</P>
<P>
Turning to his passenger, he said. "I remember something you wrote at a concert 
I did in 1976. You thought the show was too short. And I was going to send you 
a gold watch, from me to you, so that you could time my next appearance, if you 
thought time was so important." 
</P>
<P>
Young smiled at the admission. 
</P>
<P>
In defense, the reporter said the point of the review was that the concert was 
Young's first appearance in Los Angeles since the "Tonight's the Night" album 
had been released and that Young didn't do any songs from the album. The 
complaint was that Young could have extended the 95-minute show to include some 
of the "Tonight's the Night" material. 
</P>
<P>
"But time had nothing to do with it," he said, without hesitation. "I couldn't 
do those songs. That's the point. People try to look at concerts in all sorts 
of ways . . . how long it lasts, why you didn't do that song or that one. What 
they don't understand is that you don't always have the freedom to do anything 
and there's no reason why you should even if you can. 
</P>
<P>
"A performer should be aware of the audience but he can't let the audience 
dictate what he should do. That (1976 show) was representative of me that 
night. I couldn't have done the 'Tonight's the Night' album then because it was 
a group of songs from a particular time . . . a certain character. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't always feel that character. Look at the cover and you see that 
person. That wasn't the same person you saw on 'After the Gold Rush' or 
'Harvest.' You change." 
</P>
<P>
Young is working on a mammoth, 25th-anniversary retrospective album that will 
contain his best-known numbers, some personal favorites and lots of the dozens 
of recordings that have never been released. It's due late next year. 
</P>
<P>
How about the impact of sales on his musical direction? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to win every time out, but if I don't, it doesn't matter. I've had 
enough success. I never really kept track of it, except generally, but now I 
have a computer program and I can check it out . . . see graphs, see progress, 
see what's happening. But it's mostly (an excuse) to use the computer because 
I'm interested in graphs and computers. The sales don't affect what I'm going 
to do next." 
</P>
<P>
Young went through some personal trials in the '80s. He experienced post-polio 
syndrome a few years ago that was so severe he couldn't even pick up the guitar 
with his hand. He subsequently entered a vigorous program of physical therapy 
to regain strength in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
He has also complained over the years of strained relations with Geffen 
Records, which he left in 1988 for Warner Bros., where he started his solo 
career in 1969. Young and his wife, Pegi,, have helped initiate an educational 
program in the Bay Area, inspired largely by their experience in raising two 
children with cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
What about the effect of his personal life on his work? 
</P>
<P>
Without going into specifics, he simply noted, "Yeah. Well, that's a big 
subject. That's everything. Critics, sales . . . that's nothing compared to the 
things in your life." 
</P>
<P>
Young and his white Caddy must be familiar to local residents because two men 
in the market nodded and a young hitch-hiker on the road later waved as the car 
passed by. Young honked in return at the hitch-hiker. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation wandered back to the days when Young was in Los Angeles, down 
from Canada in hopes of fulfilling his rock 'n' roll dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Young smiled for a second at the image of him all those years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think naivete and luck got him through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was also the ambition and all the other stuff, but a lot of people have 
that," he added, staring at the road ahead. "You can't discount the luck -- 
like running into Stephen Stills when I was leaving to go to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been in L.A. a week with (bassist) Bruce Palmer and we were going to San 
Francisco, but we ran into Stephen in traffic and we started Buffalo 
Springfield. Maybe the road's always been lucky for me."

BEHIND THE SHARING OF A COMMON BOND;

THE HELMS AMENDMENT CREATES 'AN UNEASY ALLIANCE' BETWEEN THOSE ON CAPITOL HILL

<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Fred Grandy (R-Iowa) peers across the huge, wood desk in his private digs 
in the Cannon House Office Building, drawing a careful parallel between 
Hollywood and Washington -- both of which, he says, are "one-industry towns 
fueled by gossip." 
</P>
<P>
"When I was first a staffer here on the Hill," Grandy says, gesturing in the 
direction of a block of restaurants and shops not far from the Capitol, "there 
was a little joint up there that was a watering hole for members of Congress 
and their staffs. 
</P>
<P>
"When (Sen.) Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) walked in, it was no big deal, but if Robert 
Redford walked in, the place was all aflutter. Now, similarly, at Ma Maison or 
the Bistro Garden or Spago in L.A., if Robert Redford walks in, OK, there's a 
passing glance perhaps -- to see what he's wearing. 
</P>
<P>
"But if Ted Kennedy walks in, or (retired Lt. Col.) Ollie North, for that 
matter, you're talking about something truly fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
Grandy looks up, chuckling. "There is a subtle fascination with each other that 
is at the bottom of all this," he says of the common ground between Washington 
and Hollywood. "It's almost clandestine. Politicians are fascinated by people 
in the arts. People in the arts, in turn, are fascinated by politicians." 
</P>
<P>
This affinity has a great deal to do with how arts issues are dealt out in the 
Capitol crucible. Arts politics defies many traditional political laws of 
supply and demand. Politicians who gravitate to arts causes tend to do so 
because of personal interest in the subject matter -- sometimes even in 
apparent defiance of the demographics of their legislative districts. 
</P>
<P>
Arts issues navigate through Congress largely because of this intensely 
personal chemistry. In most years, no one notices, because monetary amounts are 
small and the issues unlikely to stir major debate. But this year has been 
different. Passions have been aroused by a debate over the proper role of the 
National Endowment for the Arts. The political tempest this has stirred 
sometimes has even overshadowed the revolution in Eastern Europe, defense 
spending and the national debt. 
</P>

Few politicians here could have the natural license Grandy does to draw his 
parallel about arts and politics. A former actor, he played Gopher in the 
television series "The Love Boat" -- but that was just an interruption in a 
Washington career that began in 1970 when Grandy worked as a legislative aide. 
</P>
<P>
Grandy is recognized on the street here sometimes more from his television 
persona than for his performances on the floor of the House of Representatives. 
His point is that little separates actors and politicians, and this commonality 
says a great deal about the confluence of the arts and the making of public 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
"No question about it, politicians and artists are both about the same thing," 
said Anne Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance and a 
longtime arts-political observer. "Both of them are about getting the feel of 
society. Both are very big players in that tunnel of the present that 
everything needs to move through to get to the future." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of an issue that you feel the country needs," said Rep. Sidney 
Yates (D-Ill.), the 80-year-old dean of arts supporters in the House. "It's the 
kind of sustenance that the country needs for its well being, its way of life, 
the atmosphere of living. Somebody has to do that kind of work in Congress. 
These issues are important and they show an importance to the people." 
</P>
<P>
Grandy's theory -- widely echoed on Capitol Hill -- is one of a variety 
proposed by congressmen, senators and their staffs for the peculiar compulsion 
that drives the symbiosis of the arts and politics. It is a relationship that 
far predates this year's fractious debate over censorship, freedom of 
expression and the rights of taxpayers -- as if their collective could ever be 
quantified -- not to have to pay for art they don't like. 
</P>
<P>
It is an attraction that transcends many usual measures of political worth. 
Political players agree that arts legislation, arts appropriations and arts 
issues produce little in terms of votes at reelection time, campaign 
contributions or any other common political currency. 
</P>
<P>
Arts issues have a broad constituency in Congress, but recent events suggest 
the support may be wider than it is thick. When President Ronald Reagan 
attempted to slash the NEA's budget by 50% in 1981 -- with elimination of the 
agency proposed for the following year -- arts political leaders formed the 
Congressional Arts Caucus and Concerned Senators for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Today the Arts Caucus, the second largest in Congress, claims 251 members of 
535 in the House and Senate. Ironically, the caucus membership does not include 
Yates. "I don't happen to belong," Yates said, "because I try to work in other 
ways." Concerned Senators claims a membership of 68 -- more than a two thirds 
majority of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
The emotional volatility of arts issues, however, has largely neutralized this 
apparent power of raw numbers in the arts debate this year. Despite the breadth 
of membership in the two groups, they were unable to avert the divisive debate 
last summer over whether the NEA should make grants to support controversial 
art -- including that which is sometimes offensive, obscene or indecent to some 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
In a single Sept. 28 vote in which the Senate, by a margin of 62 to 35, tabled 
one in a summer-long series of amendments proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) 
to impose harsh restrictions on the NEA, seven Senate members of the arts 
caucus -- including Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) -- voted with Helms. 
</P>
<P>
It has occurred at a time when, coincidentally, the arts caucus has, by most 
accounts, evolved into more of a luncheon club at which congressmen and 
senators can be photographed with movie stars than a meaningful political 
entity. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I've never really looked to the caucus for great help," said Rep. Bill 
Green (R-N.Y.), who represents a strip of Manhattan that includes more museums 
and arts institutions than any other single congressional district in the 
country. Green is also a member of the caucus executive board. "It is a 
wonderful opportunity to get your picture taken with Alan Alda," he said, "but 
I don't know that there's much beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jim Jeffords (R-Vt.) agrees the organization has drifted from its 
franchise. "I'm concerned we've gotten away from being able to articulate 
better what the purpose of the endowment is," said Jeffords, who was a founder 
of the arts caucus while he was a member of the House. "Our purpose is not just 
to have lunch with a superstar. Our purpose is to protect the arts and their 
function in our society." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, 17 members of the caucus, led by its chairman, Rep. Bob Carr 
(D-Mich.), visited Los Angeles. At least two closed discussions of censorship 
concerns were held with local arts officials -- one at the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center and the other at the American Film Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Carr insists that the power of the caucus to assure the political well-being of 
arts issues is intact. "I think (caucus) members who may have voted in favor of 
(Sen. Helms) were playing defensive ball," Carr said. "When we get the issue 
off the front page, those members can be counted on to vote for increases in 
the NEA budget and to support the activities of the caucus. On any one vote, 
people have one eyeball on their reelection and the 30-second TV spot that an 
opponent can run on them." 
</P>
<P>
The volatility of the situation has left the arts with just a handful of truly 
staunch defenders -- fewer than 20 in both the House and Senate by most counts. 
In fact, the burden of defending arts causes has fallen in large degree to just 
three people: Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) in the Senate and Yates and Rep. Pat 
Williams (D-Mont.) in the House. In 1965, Pell was an original sponsor of the 
legislation that initially established the National Endowment for the Arts and 
National Endowment for the Humanities. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the 1989 battles have occurred just ahead of what could turn out to 
be a watershed year for arts politics. Both Pell and Yates have been identified 
with arts causes for decades and both men are clearly nearing the ends of their 
public careers. Each has announced for reelection in 1990, but both face 
potentially bruising and financially well-heeled reelection campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
There is a more than passing chance that each of these arts policy legends -- 
and with them their enormous clout in seniority in the Senate and House -- 
could disappear from the political scene next year. 
</P>
<P>
Yates faces a potentially serious primary challenge in his Chicago district 
next year from Edwin Eisendrath, 31, a young Chicago alderman from a wealthy 
family with a track record of arts patronage. Opinions about what will happen 
are divided among seasoned Chicago political observers. Many experts think 
Yates will eat Eisendrath alive, but others see the race as threatening to 
Yates' 40-year career in the House. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Yates wins, however, the 1990 census is expected to show a drop in 
Illinois population and strip the state of perhaps two House seats. Chicago 
political observers say Yates' Ninth District may be at risk in 
reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
In Rhode Island, Pell anticipates a general election challenge from Rep. 
Claudine Schneider, a moderate-liberal, pro-choice Republican who, though she 
has not yet announced her candidacy, reportedly has told Pell privately she 
intends to try to unseat him. Observers here say they expect the campaign could 
be expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, an arts caucus member, is expected to formally announce just after 
the first of the year. President Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush have already 
made fund-raising appearances on her behalf. Schneider's track record on arts 
issues is unestablished, but she did speak on the House floor during the 
censorship debate in support of controversial photographs produced by Robert 
Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano that were the initial causes of the NEA crisis 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Even the theoretical possibility that Yates and/or Pell might vanish from the 
scene at such a politically risky juncture for the arts has caused apprehension 
in the creative community. "There is no question that Congressman Yates and 
Sen. Pell have been of immense help to the arts ever since the arts have been a 
part of the federal program," said NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were to pass from the scene politically, it would leave a tremendous 
void. How it would fill itself, I can't tell you. There are some very strong 
people coming up behind, but I don't think (for instance) that you can replace 
Sidney Yates. He has not only been a passionate advocate of the arts, but he 
has consummate skill in the workings of the Congress. You're not going to clone 
him." 
</P>
<P>
But the American Arts Alliance's Murphy has a longer view. "You know what 
happened in the dance world when (the legendary George) Balanchine died (in 
1983)? While there is a Balanchine alive, it's real hard to identify clearly 
the other talent that exists because the spotlight is so directly on one 
person," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
"When those leaders aren't there, other people juggle for that spot. Other 
times, it'll move into a situation where there is more than one, with 
leadership by sharing. You can't identify that new leader until the first one's 
not there." 
</P>
<P>
The line of succession in the Senate remains unclear. In the House, Williams 
has already established himself as a forceful and passionate political advocate 
for the arts. Reps. Les AuCoin (D-Ore.) and Norm Dicks (D-Wash.) could 
eventually step into Yates' shoes, should Yates not win reelection next year or 
retire in the near future even if he does prevail in the 1990 race. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is so fraught with uncertainty that Williams has already publicly 
said he may seek a strategy to delay action on a bill extending the NEA's life 
-- the agency technically expires next year -- until 1991. The strategy is 
controversial, but AuCoin and others in the House and Senate believe it may be 
necessary to avoid election year gutting of federal support for the arts driven 
by sound-bite politics that cast roles in the debate strictly of congressmen 
who favor obscenity and those who oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a smart strategy," AuCoin said. "The last thing I want to do is 
give Jesse Helms a horse to ride. Reauthorization ought to occur when people 
have time to listen without having feverish panic running through them. That 
doesn't happen when the turbochargers are on in an election year." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, said Rep. Tom Coleman (R-Mo.), the Great Arts Controversy of 1989 
caught many people in the House and Senate by surprise -- so much so that the 
political initiative was lost, at least temporarily. "The arts have a tradition 
of bipartisanship here, but we haven't had any controversy around the arts, 
other than a little bit (every few years when the NEA comes up for 
reauthorization)," Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing had triggered some sort of political tooling up, so to speak. My sense 
is that we don't hear from the arts community except in a time of budget 
restraint and that's about it. I guess it's human nature, but if you're going 
to be involved in the process, you have to be attuned and involved and have a 
presence that is consistent and continual." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, chair of the House Education and Labor Committee's subcommittee on 
postsecondary education that will have jurisdiction over the NEA 
reauthorization debate, conceded that defections from the ranks of arts 
supporters by many senators and congressmen played a key role in the political 
turmoil of the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the fact that 1990 is an election year is crucially important. He 
said defections from the ranks of senators and congressmen who may normally be 
counted as arts advocates are inevitable in a political climate in which 
conservatives have promised to make any vote or public position in favor of 
controversial arts projects into high-profile campaign issues. Thus, Williams 
said, many in Congress who would normally provide votes to stave off 
encroachments on artistic freedom may elect to cover themselves politically, 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the disarray among arts supporters in Congress) has something to do with 
the fact that people in the House and Senate who insisted on the (Helms' 
original amendment) were cleverly appealing to the lowest common denominator," 
Williams said. "That is the fear of the unknown by the American taxpayer and 
the unwillingness of the American taxpayer to have their tax dollars used for 
any effort for which they are not in full agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Short-run appeals to the dark side of human nature are quite often successful 
-- in the short run. What Sen. Helms is after will bear some political fruit, 
but only in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can tap that fear of that unknown, you can open up a political vein in 
America. Many members were simply very hopeful that a compromise that didn't 
violate the freedom of artistic expression could be reached (and congressmen 
stranded by political risk of bucking Helms would be let off the hook). I think 
in reaching the compromise, we breached the threshold of censorship." 
</P>
<P>
Williams referred to language in the NEA's 1990 appropriation bill that 
prohibits support to obscene artworks that do not meet high standards of 
artistic excellence. The wording itself appears to most legal experts to 
effectively prohibit nothing, but early tests of the NEA's nervousness about 
coming in conflict with the political sentiment that led to the language has 
already led to a crisis when Frohnmayer cut off -- and then restored -- a grant 
to an AIDS-related art show in New York that contained some politically 
provocative and sexually explicit work. 
</P>
<P>
The episode underscored the political vulnerability of the arts endowment since 
Frohnmayer, a former Portland, Ore., lawyer, stumbled badly in making political 
decisions about how to control the controversy. His having to take a crash 
course in Washington political reality could not come at a less propitious 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
Helms, who has consistently refused to discuss his arts philosophy or political 
strategy with reporters in any depth, declined half a dozen interview requests 
in the preparation of this article. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, politicians and arts-politics observers here agree that the 
nation's arts community suffers from a striking naivete in its attempts to deal 
with the political rough-and-tumble of Washington. This naivete -- combined 
with a paralyzing inability to take action when this year's political crisis 
first developed -- made a bad political situation far worse than it should have 
become, these observers say. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most congressmen . . . have a sort of generalized warm and cozy 
feeling about (NEA grant) money coming, for instance, to the Omaha symphony, 
and they feel some pride in that," said James Fitzpatrick, a prominent 
Washington arts lawyer and president of the Washington Project for the Arts, a 
local artist-run gallery and collective. "But the arts as an effective positive 
lobbying force has never been one where there has been perceived to be any need 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Politically, art has become an issue in a negative context. That has to change 
dramatically. There's going to need to be a new, energetic, pro-active strategy 
that much more aggressively defines the federal government's involvement in the 
arts as an essential part of our economic and cultural life. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to find ways in 30-second sound bites to carry the message 
that, just like great education and good health, a flourishing arts community 
is important to our civilization. Unfortunately, I don't think the arts 
community, at this point, is either prepared or capable of doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffords, the arts caucus founder, said artists and arts organizations tend to 
leave their heads in the political sand until some immediate crisis looms, then 
bombard the Washington offices of a too-narrow group of congressmen with 
panic-stricken demands for help. "I think the arts community has a tendency to 
stay within themselves and to really live in a world of their own," he said. 
"They need to break out of that. They need to understand the real world of 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
Politicians are openly skeptical of whether artists and arts groups are equal 
to the task of adapting to Congress as it may evolve on arts policy issues in 
the 1990s. "To date, arts groups have only been required -- let's face it -- to 
influence a handful of members of the House and Senate," Williams said. But the 
political gloves have come off in the last year and arts issues have been moved 
into the realm of some of the traditional high-controversy grist of the 
political mill. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I assume it has occurred to them (arts leaders) that they have 535 people 
they have to influence if they are to avoid worsening government censorship," 
Williams said. "Are they up to it? I don't see signs that they are."

Although no "Eureka!" accompanied the invention of photography, which literally 
took centuries to evolve, commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the 
medium's arrival probably seemed like a good idea. Even arbitrarily chosen 
anniversaries or birthdays can serve as cultural speed bumps, usefully slowing 
the daily rush of living to open at least a momentary space for thought. And 
the selection of 1839 as photography's official starting date -- it was the 
year Henry Fox Talbot, in London, and Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre, in Paris, 
announced nearly simultaneous technological breakthroughs -- is certainly 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as the highly publicized sesquicentennial year comes to a close, it's hard 
not to feel that opportunities have been missed. Despite the seemingly endless 
paeons to and probings of the subject, via exhibitions and books both here and 
abroad, it turns out that the most memorable and revealing event of all was 
wholly unplanned and virtually unanticipated. 
</P>
<P>
I'm referring, of course, to the still-raging arguments over photographs by 
Andres Serrano and, especially, the late Robert Mapplethorpe. As recently as 
the beginning of this month, County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich fanned the 
political flames by throwing his support behind North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms 
and Long Beach Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, who want to muzzle art, artists 
and museums that receive federal funds. Ironically, this fetid dispute 
discloses more about the complex revolution begun by photography's nominal 
invention than have most any of the celebratory exhibitions specially organized 
to tell the tale. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, four shows have sought to encompass the full sweep of photographic 
history. Chronological surveys have so far been mounted by the J. Paul Getty 
Museum, a team composed of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and London's Royal 
Academy, and another that paired Washington's National Gallery with the Art 
Institute of Chicago. The quartet will be squared off in February, when New 
York's Museum of Modern Art will weigh in with its version of "Photography 
Until Now." 
</P>
<P>
The National Gallery and Art Institute show, "On the Art of Fixing a Shadow," 
has been traveling the year and opens Thursday at the Los Angeles County Museum 
of Art. I haven't yet seen the exhibition, but the capacious, profusely 
illustrated catalogue leads me to expect a resplendent exhibition stuffed with 
arresting images arranged in provocative and insightful ways -- until, that is, 
its unbroken chain of Greatest Hits devolves into chaos and confusion somewhere 
around 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Why then? Here's a clue to understanding the mid-'60s crack-up in photography's 
seamless story: "Andy Warhol: A Retrospective." Yes, Warhol, the Prince of Pop. 
The painter. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by MoMA, this mammoth exhibition was the single best historical show 
of photography I saw during the sesquicentennial year, and it came out of the 
museum's department of painting and sculpture, not its department of 
photography. And that loopy dislocation is very much the point. While only 
slowly being understood, intricate and far-reaching questions about the 
relationships between painting and photography are crucial to grasp. 
</P>
<P>
To make his paintings, Warhol built on the precedent of Robert Rauschenberg, 
who had been using a variety of printing techniques in his work since the 
mid-1950s. Warhol would begin by clipping an existing picture from a newspaper, 
a magazine, a sales catalogue or another published source. In short, he would 
begin by literally taking a photograph. Next, the purloined photo would be 
copied, enlarged and transferred onto a silk screen, creating a kind of crude 
negative. Finally, the image would be printed by hand onto the surface of a 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn, Elvis, the electric chair, race riots, car crashes -- from the 1960s 
on, Warhol's art was about many things. Among the most important was the deadly 
tension it embodied, a tension between our culture's hidebound commitment to 
aristocratic ideals and our proud declarations of egalitarian democracy. In 
Warhol's work these twin poles are often represented by the painting's subject 
-- Elvis, say, who is both Southern white trash and "The King," or Marilyn 
Monroe, the troubled orphan impersonating a goddess. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the poles are also represented by Warhol's conflicted choice of mediums, 
which speaks eloquently of our conventional regard for painting as the highest 
of High Art and for tabloid and publicity photographs as the Peoples' Junk. 
Photography, always a second-class citizen in the stratified community of 
artistic mediums, had long since occupied a seat at the back of the bus. And 
Warhol, who had grown up the gay son of Polish-Catholic, working-class 
immigrants in a rough, Pennsylvania coal-mining neighborhood, no doubt had 
developed certain intuitive sensitivities to matters of prejudice and social 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Warhol's 1964 painting, "Sixteen Jackies," which repeats in nearly random 
arrangement six different photographs taken by the press on the day of the 
Kennedy assassination, has been included in "On the Art of Fixing a Shadow." 
The show thus takes note of this odd fact of modern artistic life: In order for 
its implications to be fully seen and taken seriously, photography, the most 
pervasive form of imagery the world has ever known, necessarily had to 
masquerade as painting. 
</P>
<P>
Before Warhol, you couldn't see the photographic forest for the aesthetic 
trees. After, there's not much point in trying. Given the cataclysmic bombshell 
that was pop art, any neatly ordered history of subsequent photography could be 
expected to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
As well it should. From Julia Margaret Cameron and Nadar in the 19th Century to 
Garry Winogrand and Diane Arbus into the '60s, not to mention the countless 
important stops in between, a compelling case could be made -- has been made -- 
for photography as a distinct, self-enclosed medium marked by issues wholly 
unique from any other tool an artist might use. Such a history of the first 
100-odd years could plausibly be written because, right from the moment of its 
inception, photography was branded an unfavored stepchild among artistic 
mediums, as battles raged over whether or not it was really art. 
</P>
<P>
As surely as any innocent kid disfigured by youthful trauma, photographic 
history was marked. It's pretty late in the day to be pressing those formalist 
arguments now, and I'm not saying that's what any of the four big surveys have 
actually attempted. But neither has any one of them used the anniversary 
platform for a full-scale overhaul based on post-formalist points of view. 
</P>
<P>
Two shows that coincided with photography's sesquicentennial did indeed 
recognize the full scope of this rupture. Both took an expansive view of 
post-1960s developments in the revolution initiated by the camera and didn't 
limit themselves by medium. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Contemporary Art's big summer show, "A Forest of Signs: Art in 
the Crisis of Representation," did a good job in sorting through the mixed-up 
landscape of camera-images that has turned our culture into a mesmerizing hall 
of mirrors. In New York, meanwhile, the Whitney Museum's current "Image World: 
Art and Media Culture" gets hopelessly lost trying to traverse the tangled 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in their difficult assessments of the nature of art in the age of 
mechanical and electronic reproduction, both shows refuse to segregate 
photographs and video from paintings and sculptures. The abundance of strong 
work made each an embarrassment of riches. 
</P>
<P>
"A Forest of Signs" was significant for another reason. It made a persuasive 
case for the number of women who, as artists coming to maturity in the 1970s, 
critically used the typically disenfranchised medium of photography as an 
aesthetic parallel to their own second-class status as women. Cindy Sherman, 
Sherrie Levine, Barbara Kruger and others have turned their art toward sharply 
outlining certain ugly contours of our culture's deeply held, but nonetheless 
enslaving, conventions. Men, we're still content covertly to believe, are 
seminal producers, while women are rather like the lowly camera: Their chief 
function is to reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the revolution that surrounds the invention of photography is complex. 
Among its more simple, and therefore more profound, transformations was a 
radical alteration in the profile of precisely who could make and circulate 
pictures. Before photography, most all images were made by working artists -- 
which is to say, artists who worked for patrons, and who made pictures 
according to those patrons' tastes. 
</P>
<P>
After photography, and especially in the "Instamatic" world we now inhabit, 
anyone can (and does) make pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The unruliness of post-1960s art, and of photography's place within it, is in 
some respects simply a final echo of this earlier transformation. Peace and 
prosperity reigned, at least for some, when imagery chiefly represented the 
authoritative class that held the power. Photography opened the door to the 
disheveled and unruly mob. Suddenly, the face of Everyman could enter into 
art's exalted picture alongside representations of earlier Medicis and Popes. 
So, one good way to keep the riffraff discredited and at bay was loudly to 
proclaim: Sorry, but photography isn't art. 
</P>
<P>
Things have gotten more sophisticated, or at least more cleverly disguised, 
since then. Last summer, when the exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe's 
photographs came under attack for including pictures described by Sen. Helms as 
homoerotic, the neoconservative critic Hilton Kramer denounced the pictures as 
pornography, then turned heel and upheld their status as art, albeit "failed 
art, pernicious art." Kramer, who has assumed the burdensome duty of becoming 
the Tipper Gore of modern art, is apparently convinced that these photographs 
will scare the horses. 
</P>
<P>
"What has made them a public issue," Kramer wrote in the New York Times, "is 
the demand that is now being made to accord these hitherto forbidden images the 
status of perfectly respectable works of art, to exhibit them without 
restriction in public institutions, and to require our government to provide 
funds for their public exhibition." 
</P>
<P>
Forbidden, status, respectability, restriction ... of all the moralizing words 
Kramer chose to define the social aspects of the issue, the most revealing, I 
think, are in the closing volley, where our government is faced with funding 
their exhibition. It's us against them, Kramer plainly suggests, and it's easy 
to see who is who. The argument is political. It's neoconservative status vs. 
forbidden liberalism. And, given Mapplethorpe's photographs, it's heteroerotic 
respectability vs. homoerotic restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
This latter battle is what lies at the heart of the appalling compromise 
legislation in Congress, whereby the National Endowment for the Arts has been 
barred from funding art they consider "obscene," including works depicting 
homoeroticism. Drawing a legislative equation between obscenity and 
homoeroticism is flatly repugnant and tantamount to a legal sanction for gay 
bashing. 
</P>
<P>
That passage of this legislation was greeted by the art world with some relief 
is also a sign that, as 1990 looms, it's still perfectly respectable for at 
least one group of American citizens to be the official object of public 
prejudice. As photography's sesquicentennial party comes to an end, with the 
Mapplethorpe scandal the most memorable event, it's not a pretty picture.

HORNS OF A DILEMMA: JAZZ ON THE RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
During the past quarter century, jazz and radio have had what has often seemed 
to be an adversarial relationship. Live music shows are down to a precious few; 
all-jazz disc jockey stations are so rare that even New York City had none for 
several years in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
While the Southland has been better off than most major urban centers, as of 
Jan. 1 there will only be one FM jazz station in the area -- KLON, 88.1, in 
Long Beach. KKGO, switching to all-classical, will move its jazz format to an 
AM outlet, KKJZ. 
</P>
<P>
The KLON story is not simply that of a radio station. Increasingly, it 
represents a force for the propagation of innovative live events. Even 
listeners outside the station's range (the 1,200 watt power has limits, though 
some as far away as San Diego and Santa Barbara can hear it) are aware of it 
because they have attended some of the dozen major concerts presented under its 
auspices this year. 
</P>
<P>
"These are extremely gratifying times for us," said Ken Poston, the concert 
coordinator. "Our concert reuniting the legendary Lighthouse All Stars in 
Hermosa Beach came out recently on an album. In August we presented four 
concerts at the John Anson Ford Theatre celebrating the 50th anniversary of 
Blue Note Records. We've had other concerts at Eldorado Park during the summer, 
a blues festival on campus at Cal State Long Beach, and on Dec. 6, 500 fans 
came aboard the Queen Mary for our party featuring Terry Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, there's an audience out there for the best in mainstream-modern music. 
During 1990, we hope to include, in our live shows, a West Coast version of the 
Charles Mingus celebration at New York's Town Hall." 
</P>
<P>
All this is heady stuff for what began modestly in 1981 on a station that had 
been known less for jazz than for polka, opera and bluegrass. "Three of us who 
were there from the start are still on the air," says program director Ken 
Borgers. "I'm on in the morning, my sister Helen in the afternoon, and Bob 
Epstein does a traditional jazz show on Sundays." 
</P>
<P>
A non-commercial station, KLON keeps itself afloat through corporate donations 
and memberships (presently 7,800 members pay $40 a year). The ongoing battle to 
increase the station's power to 30,000 watts finally seems close to resolution. 
</P>
<P>
How does a jazz radio station survive without making commercial compromises? 
Isn't the tendency to lean to fusion and jazz/rock all but irresistible? 
</P>
<P>
"We like to play two or more new releases per hour," says Helen Borgers, "along 
with two numbers by our respective featured artists of the day. We each have 
our favorites; I believe in keeping people aware of the roots. Roy Daniels, 
whose show precedes mine -- he's on from 9:30 to 1:30 -- is more into hard bop. 
But in general, middle-of-the-road companies like Concord Jazz, who record Gene 
Harris and so many mainstream people, are our life's blood." 
</P>
<P>
Bubba Jackson, who handles the 6:30 to midnight shift, takes a dimmer view: 
"We're four or five years behind the times. By not having Dave Grusin, Hugh 
Masekela or Miriam Makeba in our library, we're ignoring the changes in the 
music industry. We're failing to serve a younger generation. I don't go out of 
my way to buck the general policy here, but Luther Hughes' new show will help." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, a reputable bass player, will host one of three new programs set to 
start in January. "Sure, I'll include some of the better fusion things," he 
said. "I can show how we got from Dizzy and Bird to where we are today. I have 
some very contemporary guests lined up: David Benoit, John Patitucci, Eric 
Marienthal." Hughes' show, "Jazz Today," will kick off Jan. 6 from 9 
p.m.-midnight, continuing every Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Latin jazz also must be recognized as integral to any overall jazz coverage. 
"Jazz on the Latin Side," which supposedly will present strictly jazz-oriented 
Latin music rather than salsa, will air Sundays at 9 p.m. with Jose Rizo in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
A welcome returnee to the airwaves, though less felicitously spotted, is Howard 
Lucraft, the British-born journalist (mainly for "Variety"), composer and 
guitarist, who will lean toward nostalgia in a Saturday series from 5-8 a.m., 
presumably aimed at whoever stayed up very late on Fridays. His early subjects 
will include the veteran clarinetist Abe Most and the late Kenton singer Ann 
Richards. 
</P>
<P>
The blues idiom, which has enjoyed a healthy renaissance during the last five 
years, will be acknowledged by a near tripling of the time allotted to Bernie 
Pearl's "Nothin' But the Blues," which will air Saturdays and Sundays from 2 to 
6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, there is no united front in jazz: The schisms among opinion-holders 
are as irreconcilable as ever. One can still come across a die-hard who assures 
you that nothing of real value has been created since 1940. The bop innovations 
of Gillespie and Parker, though still unacceptable and "too modern" for these 
antiquarians, are regarded by many observers today as part of a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Other aficionados, all of them decades younger, will not even recognize the 
names of anyone who lived before the flowering in the 1960s of John Coltrane. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a middle ground can and must be found. Those who complained that 
they heard "too much fusion" on KKGO failed to recognize that this was a 
commercial station fighting for viability. If KLON (operated by Pacific Public 
Radio, a nonprofit corporation) can pick up the mantle and maintain a modicum 
of integrity, it may become more than ever a valuable force in a too often 
fragmented musical community.

'BUT I AM HIP'; 
</P>
<P>
PRODUCED BY THE PET SHOP BOYS, LIZA MINNELLI'S MOST AMBITIOUS ALBUM MAY BE A 
TRIUMPH IN EUROPE, BUT AMERICAN AUDIENCES JUST AREN'T BUYING HER HIPPER IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Liza Minnelli was fidgeting, her fingers nervously drumming on the table in 
nearly deserted dining room of the Beverly Hills hotel. She needed a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
While Minnelli was talking about risk-taking, her secretary, sitting a few 
tables away, raced to the rescue with a pack of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Minnelli's intensity level dropped a few notches after the first puff -- from 
fiercely intense to just plain intense. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the need to take risks now," she explained, referring to her surprising 
new pop/dance album, "Results," which was co-produced and mostly composed by 
Britain's Pet Shop Boys, known for their brooding, offbeat dance music. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why. Maybe it's my age (43), or those publicized changes in my 
life (kicking the substance-abuse habit), or maybe it's something bizarre, like 
the position of the planets -- who knows? I just know I was driven to do 
something different -- like this album." 
</P>
<P>
Minnelli clenched her fists for emphasis, one of her impressive array of 
melodramatic gestures. 
</P>
<P>
Recording "Results" -- her first contemporary pop album in 12 years -- was 
certainly a big risk for her considering that, in the pop/dance scene, Minnelli 
is a stranger in a strange land. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli, she's primarily 
known as an actress (she won an Oscar in 1972 for her performance in "Cabaret") 
and an old-fashioned Broadway-style song-belter who sings standards and show 
tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Speculating on the response to this unorthodox project, Minnelli said, in a 
mock-horrified tone: "People are probably saying: 'What's she doing singing 
this dance music stuff?' But where is it written that Liza Minnelli can't sing 
dance music -- or anything she feels like?" 
</P>
<P>
Minnelli was giving off a jumble of messages. While marvelously glib and 
sophisticated, there were steady flashes of her little-girl-lost persona -- 
enhanced by those big sad eyes. It seemed obvious that the elegant superstar 
also has an insecure and vulnerable side. 
</P>
<P>
"Insecure . . . me?," she deadpanned when the subject of insecurity came up. 
"Of course I am. Everybody knows that about me. It's part of the image." 
</P>
<P>
It's another part of her image, however, that may work against her making it 
big in the youth-dominated pop scene where the Pet Shop Boys are considered hip 
and Minnelli is mostly regarded as an easy-listening performer -- and not at 
all hip. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am hip," Minnelli protested with a sweeping wave of her arm vigorous 
enough to knock the ash off her cigarette. "I like (rapper) Heavy D and 
(rocker) Joan Jett. I listen to a lot of current music. What I'm about 
musically isn't just what I sing with Frank (Sinatra) and Sammy (Davis Jr.)" 
</P>
<P>
But will audiences accept this hipper Liza? 
</P>
<P>
European audiences already have. The album and the first single, "Losing My 
Mind" -- a Stephen Sondheim song from the musical "Follies" -- were hits over 
there, particularly in England, where both made the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
American audiences, though, are still leery of the new Liza. Her album, 
released 
</P>
<P>
in late September, is in Billboard's basement, bubbling under the Top 100. 
"Losing My Mind" never made the pop singles chart, but was fairly popular in 
dance clubs, cracking the Top 25 on the club-play chart. 
</P>
<P>
This is her first contemporary album since the disco-oriented "Tropical Nights" 
a dozen years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"That one was done during the disco era," she recalled. "I hated singing those 
songs. They weren't about anything. It was a big mistake. The album died. It 
wasn't promoted. I don't even think I wanted it promoted." 
</P>
<P>
After that venture, she stuck to live, Broadway-style albums until last year, 
when she signed with Epic/CBS Records and decided to plunge into the pop 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"My friend (and manager) Gene Simmons (of Kiss) put the bug in my ear a few 
years ago about doing a pop album of contemporary songs," she said. "The record 
company even liked the idea. It was just a matter of who I should work with. 
When the Pet Shop Boys opportunity came up, I was ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Tennant, the bright, chatty and candid spokesman of the Pet Shop Boys, 
recalled his first meeting with Minnelli in England in July of last year. He 
was accompanied by his partner Chris Lowe. They wanted to find out, among other 
things, whether their personalities meshed with hers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were nervous, of course, meeting this superstar," Tennant said by phone 
from London. "We wanted to like her because we wanted to work with her. If she 
had been one of those stars with a big ego and told us, 'I won't do this or 
this or this . . . ,' well, we couldn't have worked with her. But we all got 
along right away. That was the big step. She wanted to put herself in our 
hands. Well, who could resist that." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Watkins, then the Pet Shop Boys' manager but now their ex-manager, had 
heard about Minnelli's plans to make a pop album and pursued the possibility of 
her working with the duo. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally we were supposed to do just a few cuts on the album but after we 
met and started discussing ideas, she wanted us to do the whole album," Tennant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
They wrote five new songs for her and found three others -- including 
Sondheim's "Losing My Mind" and Tanita Tikaram's "Twist of My Sobriety" -- that 
could be reworked in their style. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted her to do 'Sobriety' as this outrageous, psychotic song, but weren't 
sure she'd go for it," Tennant said. "Everybody knows about Liza and drug rehab 
and all that. But she got a big kick out of doing a song that mentioned 
sobriety." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that intrigued the duo about the project was the lack of 
restrictions. "She said do whatever you want and be as avant-garde as 
possible," Tennant said. "If you're a producer and writer, that's music to your 
ears." 
</P>
<P>
The more enthusiastic reception to the album in Europe came as no surprise to 
Tennant: "She has a different stature in Europe. She's a colossal star, she's 
treated with reverence. In America, Liza is perceived as this Vegas performer. 
That's a stigma in America, but not in Europe. Europeans love the Vegas glitter 
and Liza projects some of that. 
</P>
<P>
"In Europe this album was an event. In America, she has to struggle to get 
radio play. It's very weird when you're treated better in foreign countries 
than you are in your home country. That can't make her feel very good." 
</P>
<P>
Some American critics haven't been kind to "Results." People magazine treated 
it like a bad joke, comparing it to Ethel Merman's infamously awful disco album 
of 1979. 
</P>
<P>
But "Results" has its supporters too. 
</P>
<P>
Done in the Pet Shop Boys' trademark moody, eerie, detached style, the album 
boasts songs that are very melodic and danceable. Rather than belting out songs 
in her usual theatrical style, Minnelli virtually becomes a Pet Shop Girl, her 
vocals subdued and droning -- almost ethereal. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why she was so eager to work with the Pet Shop Boys, she said, "I 
like their offbeat style. It's dance-music with this tough edge. I like the 
biting, cynical quality of their songs -- and the dramatic quality of the songs 
too. I thought I could fit their style very easily. 
</P>
<P>
"I also liked the fact that it's so different from what I usually do. If I'm 
going to do a pop album I might as well go all the way -- as far away from my 
image as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Musically, Minnelli essentially surrendered herself to the Pet Shop Boys. 
</P>
<P>
"I was putty in their hands," she said. "I trusted them not to do anything 
weird, like putting strange effects on my voice, or speeding me up or slowing 
me down or making me sound totally like someone else. 
</P>
<P>
"What they did was put me in a key much lower than I'm used to singing in. They 
doubled my voice and put it on top of the background music. I wasn't singing 
loud. It wasn't theatrical singing. I was singing in a quiet, personal way." 
</P>
<P>
This album isn't for Minnelli's hard-core fans. It's for pop fans and 
dance-music fans, particularly those who like the Pet Shop Boys. According to 
Minnelli, though, her peers like the album. 
</P>
<P>
"I was touring with Frank and Sammy when I was recording the album," she said. 
"I played it for them and they liked it. If other friends don't like it, they 
haven't told me." 
</P>
<P>
Minnelli said she has no plans to do a "Results" tour with the Pet Shop Boys. 
But is it possible that she might bow out of theatrical singing and turn 
dance-music diva? 
</P>
<P>
"No, no . . . no!," Minnelli shrieked emphatically, clenching one hand into a 
fist and reaching for another cigarette with the other. "I'm not giving up my 
bread-and-butter. Theatrical singing is as much part of me as breathing." 
</P>
<P>
How about her ability to relate to the younger fans -- the target group for 
this album? No problem either, she insisted: "I'm not this old lady looking for 
her lost youth. The key is doing music they can relate to. If the kids like the 
music, they won't care if I'm 80 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the criticism of the album, Minnelli said: "I knew when I did it that 
people would take some shots at me -- that some would laugh and say: 'What is 
she trying to prove?"' 
</P>
<P>
Stopping for a moment, she struck a pose of mock-haughtiness, peering around 
condescendingly. She snootily announced: "Dahling, I have nothing to prove. I'm 
Liza. That's enough." 
</P>
<P>
Minnelli seemed to be kidding -- but maybe she wasn't.

POP EYE: KEEPING A SCORECARD ON WINNERS, LOSERS IN RECORD INDUSTRY WARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN and PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was the Year of the Comeback, with everyone from the Rolling Stones to 
Donny Osmond to Alice Cooper making big splashes. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the scenes, the record industry was full of tumult, with a flurry 
of executive shuffles and company sell-offs (the biggest being A&amp;M, which 
PolyGram bought for an eye-popping $500 million). 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most labels remained comfortably in the black, thanks largely to the 
continuing compact disc boom. Times are so good that everybody wants to get 
into the music business. Topping the list: Irving Azoff, who's starting his own 
label, and the Walt Disney Co., which is jumping in with Hollywood Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there room for more players in the already fiercely competitive industry? 
Will the new labels spark a fierce bidding war as they vie for budding 
superstars? Will the CD boom finally go bust? 
</P>
<P>
 While the music business ponders these and other questions over the holidays, 
Pop Eye takes a look at how the industry's major players fared this year. 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;M Records 
</P>
<P>
PolyGram Inc. certainly didn't buy A&amp;M based on its 1989 performance, 
though the label's lackluster showing over the past year may have been what 
finally prompted Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss to sell the company they had 
founded in 1962. (The execs shrewdly kept A&amp;M's prized music-publishing 
firm.) It was such a bad year that the label's biggest hit until October was a 
fluke No. 1 single by soap-opera star Michael Damian. Happily, Janet Jackson 
came through late in the year with "Rhythm Nation," her ballyhooed follow-up 
album to "Control," which sold a quick two million copies. 
</P>
<P>
Arista 
</P>
<P>
Critics rarely rave about Arista artists, but the label has achieved a solid 
track record in recent years by discovering acts with Top 40 appeal, such as 
Whitney Houston, Expose and Taylor Dayne. This year's new model is Milli 
Vanilli, a pair of poster-boy popsters whose debut album has sold five million 
copies (and counting) -- and spun off a trio of No. 1 singles. But despite the 
company's high pop profile, the Eurythmics' label debut album has gotten off to 
a slow start, and Dion's comeback attempt fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic 
</P>
<P>
It was a platinum pajama party as the label's leading ladies all hit the Top 
10. Bette Midler landed one of the biggest surprise hits of the year with the 
"Beaches" sound track, which spawned her first No. 1 single, "Wind Beneath My 
Wings." An even bigger surprise was the Top 10 success of Donna Summer's first 
post-Geffen single. Debbie Gibson aged gracefully, landing her first No. 1 
album and another No. 1 single. Skid Row (who are even prettier than Gibson) 
and Winger (who aren't) also scored platinum albums. Phil Collins and his 
Genesis mate Mike Rutherford (with the Mechanics) each topped the singles 
chart, but Foreigner's Mick Jones bombed with his debut solo album. 
</P>
<P>
Capitol 
</P>
<P>
After several sluggish years for the label, Capitol's executives were in the 
hot seat -- and president David Berman got burned. The industry vet got the ax 
in September and was replaced by Hale Milgrim, a touted marketing exec from 
Elektra Records. The label's A&amp;R department, which had a poor track record 
of discovering new hitmakers, was also reorganized this fall. Many of the 
label's 1989 hits were with acts on the comeback trail, notably Bonnie Raitt 
(who had her highest-charting album ever), the Doobie Brothers and even Donny 
Osmond, who shocked the industry by zooming to No. 2 on the singles chart with 
"Soldier of Love." But the label's most cherished comeback bid was its biggest 
disappointment: Paul McCartney's "Flowers in the Dirt" album, which didn't even 
crack the Top 20. The label nabbed the Beastie Boys, but the rap hotshots' 
follow-up to their No. 1 CBS debut stalled at No. 14. Capitol had a platinum 
album from rapper M.C. Hammer, and, thanks to its deal with Enigma, hard-rock 
hits by Great White and Poison. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia 
</P>
<P>
The industry is crediting new kids on the block with lifting this sleeping 
giant out of a lengthy slump. And they're not just talking about teen phenoms 
New Kids on the Block, whose "Hangin' Tough" album has sold 6 million copies -- 
the year's best seller. They're also referring to the arrival of a new 
management team headed by former rock manager Tommy Mottola and one-time Arista 
hotshot Don Ienner. The label's renowned marketing machinery also sparked 
comebacks by Billy Joel and the Rolling Stones. A greatest hits set by Journey 
quietly sold 2 million copies; making more noise on their way to platinum were 
metal upstarts Warrant and a trio of rap acts from Columbia's Def Jam 
affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
Elektra 
</P>
<P>
It's time for label chief Bob Krasnow to light up another victory cigar. The 
most artist-oriented label of the '80s continued to prosper with a remarkably 
diverse talent roster. Where else could you find speed-metal masters Metallica 
rubbing shoulders with silky show-tune crooner Michael Feinstein? Elektra's 
across-the-board 1989 successes ranged from metal homeboys Motley Crue (who 
landed their first No. 1 album) to post-punk heroes the Cure, who had their 
biggest album to date (and headlined Dodger Stadium). 
</P>
<P>
EMI 
</P>
<P>
This label has had more to brag about in recent years than its much larger 
sister label, Capitol. Richard Marx avoided the sophomore jinx with "Repeat 
Offender," which has already outsold his first album, topping the 3 million 
mark. Marx also came through with a pair of No. 1 singles as did Roxette, 
Sweden's hottest pop export since ABBA. David Bowie's "Tin Machine" was the 
label's biggest disappointment, barely making the Top 30. 
</P>
<P>
Epic 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a concerted label push and pivotal MTV support, Living Colour made 
history as the first black rock band to go platinum since the heyday of Jimi 
Hendrix and Sly &amp; the Family Stone. But with the exception of that album 
and Gloria Estefan's strong showing, Epic was living on its past laurels this 
year. Its other platinum albums (Ozzy Osbourne, Europe and Joan Jett) were all 
holdovers from 1988. Company stalwarts Cyndi Lauper and the Jacksons bombed, as 
did label newcomers Liza Minnelli and the Jefferson Airplane. One comeback that 
did pan out was Alice Cooper, who mined his first gold album since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a label with momentum to burn. After a few lean years in the mid 
'80s, Geffen has built a much-envied track record in recent years thanks to a 
shrewd promotion department and a stable of high-profile (and hotly 
competitive) A&amp;R execs. The label has had so much success that it's 
expected to reactivate Asylum Records early next year to make room for more 
young artists. Two smash albums by hometown bad boys Guns N' Roses sold a 
combined total of 5 million copies. Aerosmith and Don Henley returned with 
platinum albums, while Cher (aided by a revealing video shot on the U.S.S. 
Missouri) earned the first platinum album of her career. Edie Brickell &amp; 
the New Bohemians rode their 1988 album into the Top 5 in February. 
</P>
<P>
MCA 
</P>
<P>
Is there life after Irving Azoff? Last summer the industry's most colorful (and 
controversial) figure left the label he brought back from the dead to start a 
new company bankrolled by Warner Bros. The crowning achievement for Azoff and 
his team -- which included successor Al Teller -- came in July when MCA became 
the first label in eight years to monopolize the top three spots on Billboard's 
pop album chart. The label scored with the Fine Young Cannibals (whose album 
had the longest run at No. 1 this year), Bobby Brown and Tom Petty. The label's 
black music division also had hits with Heavy D. &amp; the Boyz and Guy 
featuring Teddy Riley. On the other hand, Tiffany's album fell short of the 
phenomenal success of her 1987 debut, and Patti LaBelle's latest flopped. 
</P>
<P>
Motown 
</P>
<P>
In its first full year of operation since former MCA hotshot Jheryl Busby took 
over the top job, Motown has been trying to regain some of its long-lost 
momentum by going after fresh talent and building relationships with hot 
producers. But it still has a long way to go. The one-time hit factory had a 
platinum album with teen dreams the Boys, but had the year's most embarrassing 
bomb with Diana Ross' "Workin' Overtime," the pop diva's heralded return to her 
former home. 
</P>
<P>
PolyGram 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last year, PolyGram was one of the industry's hottest rock 
factories, fueled by such bands as Bon Jovi and Def Leppard. This year it 
cooled off considerably, perhaps prompting the sudden departure of label chief 
Dick Asher last month. The label's biggest album was a multiplatinum holdover 
from 1988, Bon Jovi's "New Jersey." John Cougar Mellencamp and Tears for Fears 
released eagerly awaited new albums that went platinum, but didn't match past 
sales triumphs. Critics raved, however, about a pair of down-home up 'n' 
comers, Michelle Shocked and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
RCA 
</P>
<P>
It was a quiet year for ol' Nipper, which didn't have much product from its pop 
mainstays and lost respected A&amp;R chief Paul Atkinson to MCA. Apart from a 
strong showing by its venerable country division, the label has been living off 
profits from its "Dirty Dancing" sound-track bonanzas. In country, K. T. Oslin 
and the Judds each had two platinum albums while newcomer Clint Black scored a 
gold album. The best news for the rock division came from heavy-metal goddess 
Lita Ford, whose 1988 "Lita" album went platinum, and gothic-popsters Love and 
Rockets, whose album went Top 15. 
</P>
<P>
Virgin 
</P>
<P>
Wanna bet on who'll be the hottest industry label of the early '90s? We'll put 
our money on Virgin, a daring young label run by creative executives with a 
shrewd eye for artists with strong visual identity. Two years ago Paula Abdul 
was choreographing Janet Jackson's videos. Now she's Jackson's arch-rival as 
the princess of dance pop, thanks to a trio of spiffy videos that ruled MTV all 
year. All three of those singles reached No. 1, as did Abdul's debut album, 
which has sold more than 4 million copies. Virgin also had platinum albums from 
the late Roy Orbison and hot newcomers Soul II Soul, plus critical valentines 
for hip-hop diva Neneh Cherry and singer-songwriter Lenny Kravitz. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
The Mercedes of the music business, Warners is renowned for its executive 
stability, wide-ranging artist roster and comfortable, family-style 
environment. This year, the Burbank-based company continued to be the 
industry's most watched -- and most imitated -- firm (even if some young Turks 
are grumbling that the label is resting on its laurels a bit). Madonna and 
Prince, the '80s' most erotic and adventuresome pop icons, were back at No. 1 
with double-platinum albums. The label's folksy oldsters the Traveling Wilburys 
also sold 2 million, while Karyn White became the year's hottest black female 
singer with her debut album. Warners, with its Reprise and Sire affiliates, 
also had impressive outings with the B-52's, Lou Reed, the Cult, Elvis Costello 
and Eric Clapton. 
</P>
<P>
Mighty Indies 
</P>
<P>
Delicious Vinyl landed the first No. 1 album by a black rapper with Tone Loc's 
"Loc-ed After Dark" in April, and has Young M.C. coming on strong. . . . 
Priority landed two platinum albums with gangster-style rappers Eazy-E and 
N.W.A, whose incendiary anthems on "Straight Outta Compton" were the most hotly 
debated pop lyrics of the year. . . . Profile's rap crew, Rob Base &amp; D.J. 
E-Z Rock, also went platinum. . . . Def Jam had platinum hits with Slick Rick, 
LL Cool J and Public Enemy. . . . Tommy Boy won critical plaudits and gold 
sales with its rap rookies, De La Soul. . . . After losing both Robert Palmer 
and Steve Winwood, Island was sold to PolyGram. . . . And Rhino had continued 
success with its rock oldie reissues.

SANTA GOES EVERYWHERE TO GIVE A LIFT TO THE NEEDY

He was nine days early, but Santa Claus came to town on Saturday anyway. 
</P>
<P>
He came by hot air balloon to Los Angeles' inner city, where about 30,000 
people jammed the intersection of Crocker and 5th streets to see him help 
distribute 15,000 bags of toys and 25,000 bags of food collected by the Fred 
Jordan Mission. 
</P>
<P>
He came by police car to the Union Mission on Skid Row, where 1,000 lined up to 
see him and receive second-hand clothing and used Christmas toys. 
</P>
<P>
He came on foot to an athletic hall at USC, where he visited with 100 sick and 
disadvantaged children who came to receive gifts and listen to carols sung by 
members of the the university's football team. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived in a 50-year-old open-cockpit Stearman biplane at the Santa Monica 
Airport, where he distributed candy canes to 200 children at the Museum of 
Flying. 
</P>
<P>
He came by Jeep to St. Thomas Catholic School in the Mid-City area, where he 
welcomed 638 children to a party organized by El Salvador's Consul General to 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He landed by police helicopter at the Pacific Ford dealership in Long Beach, 
where he helped police and firefighters stage a gift and food drive for needy 
families. 
</P>
<P>
He rolled up in a station wagon in Bell Gardens, where he handed wrapped gifts 
to about 1,500 American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
And he glided up in a wheel-equipped sleigh pulled by two reindeer to Hollywood 
Boulevard, where he stepped over Eva Marie Saint's sidewalk star and waved to 
onlookers from a whitewashed concrete winter wonderland set up by 
Scientologists. 
</P>
<P>
"This could only happen in Hollywood," said long-haired rock 'n' roll singer 
Raeph Hargrove, 25, of Athens, Ala., as he watched reindeers named Squirrel and 
Flop deliver a red-suited Girard Pinard. "Now I've seen everything." 
</P>
<P>
At the Fred Jordan Mission, a bearded Chet Beintema waved to children from the 
hot air balloon. "There are a lot of ups and downs in this business," quipped 
Beintema, who worked the balloon's gas jets. 
</P>
<P>
Mission president Willie Jordan had expected 20,000 visitors to the annual 
block party, but perhaps 30,000 showed up. She said children who left when the 
mission ran out of toys, bags of groceries and 9,000 new blankets would receive 
tickets to come back and pick them up on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really overwhelmed by the number of people in need. It's frightening," 
Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Union Mission, Reserve Los Angeles Police Officer Gary Hall, who works 
as an associate television producer, portrayed Santa as fellow Reserve Officer 
John Christie, a contractor, distributed 1,500 stuffed animals collected by 
students at Oakwood School in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad thing is you see some of the same kids here over and over, year after 
year," said Hall, in his fifth year as a Skid Row Santa. "You hope their 
circumstances are going to improve. These kids are so grateful, even for a 
second-hand stuffed animal." 
</P>
<P>
In Bell Gardens, bearded Rod Blankenship handed wrapped gifts to Indian 
children like Jennifer Banagas, 2, a Seminole from Norwalk, and 10-year-old 
Michael George, a Nez Perce from Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
About 35,000 American Indians in the Los Angeles area live beneath the poverty 
level, said event co-chairwoman Sallie Cuarezma, a Cherokee who lives in 
Gardena. "Santa is not in the Indian heritage, but the spirit of giving is an 
important part of our culture," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Salvadoran gathering, children received balloons and bags of toys. 
"There is nothing political about this," said Rosa Maria Angulo, wife of Consul 
General Jose M. Angulo. "It's just people who love each other. Christmas is sad 
now in El Salvador. It's sad people are killing people." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, 9-year-old Guadalupe Fabian waited patiently for her turn to see Santa, 
portrayed by a jolly, costumed Juan Carlos Arce. She said she did not have a 
Christmas list this year to whisper into his ear. 
</P>
<P>
"For Christmas I'd just like peace in El Salvador and in Los Angeles," 
Guadalupe said.

ETHICS FEVER HAS COUNCIL SMOLDERING; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: PUBLICLY, MEMBERS SEEM AGREEABLE TO REFORMS. BUT A BATTLE IS BREWING 
OVER PROPOSALS THAT COULD CHANGE THE RULES OF LOCAL POLITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the warren of offices at City Hall, a wickedly snide takeoff on new 
proposals to govern the ethics of government officials is circulating. 
</P>
<P>
"No elected official, officers, general manager or employee shall enjoy the 
respect of the public for any reason," it declares, its form and language aping 
the stilted bureaucratese of an ethics document crafted over the last eight 
months by a mayoral commission. 
</P>
<P>
The two-page spoof has drawn some fans. Hidden behind the agreeable nods of 
City Council members who have studiously called for ethics reform in the wake 
of conflict-of-interest allegations raised against Mayor Tom Bradley, an oddly 
defined and occasionally angry battle is brewing over proposals that could 
markedly change the rules of politics in the city. 
</P>
<P>
As hearings begin into the package's future, the ethics debate has made for 
strange and ironic maneuverings. Two council members usually identified with 
political reform have lined up against it. Mayor Bradley, whose controversial 
financial dealings spawned the proposals, has defended it. 
</P>
<P>
But most council members have taken to their bunkers, fearful that any spoken 
objections will be used to slay them at the polls. The reason, simply, is the 
apple-pie nature of the ethics issue -- and the vows of the ethics commission 
to take the matter to the voters if the council does not approve the package by 
February. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman-turned-lobbyist Arthur K. Snyder derides a 40-page draft ethics 
ordinance as "a ridiculous amount of overkill" in response to Bradley's crisis. 
But he nevertheless aptly describes the treacherous turf now treaded by the 
council, particularly those members inclined to question specific reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of like being against motherhood. Maybe worse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first public hearing on the proposals by the Commission to Draft an Ethics 
Code for Los Angeles City Government, the group appointed by the mayor last 
spring when questions about his behavior first surfaced, was held before the 
council's ad hoc ethics committee on Thursday. Two hearings are scheduled this 
week before the committee sends its recommendations to the full council in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's sweeping report, if approved, not only would outlaw the 
financial transactions that drew Bradley into controversy, but would also vault 
Los Angeles into the tight circle of cities nationwide that have launched 
exhaustive reforms to quell public suspicion of government officials. 
</P>
<P>
It would expand the city's financial disclosure requirements, ordering senior 
and elected officials to release information not only about their investment 
holdings but also other items like home mortgages. A city ethics commission, 
modeled after the state Fair Political Practices Commission, would ride herd on 
unethical behavior. The enforcement powers of the city attorney would be 
broadened, a special prosecutor could be named in sensitive cases, and ethics 
training would be required for city employees. 
</P>
<P>
In what are considered the most controversial aspects, the reforms also would 
outlaw the earning of outside income, all gifts and honorariums, and would 
order the public financing of city political campaigns. In California, only 
Sacramento County has approved public campaign financing. 
</P>
<P>
In only the first council committee session on the matter, the touchy nature of 
the future debate was unleashed -- paradoxically, by Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi, who for years fought his peers to invoke campaign reform, and by 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, whose successful 1987 campaign against then-Council 
President Pat Russell established Galanter's reputation as an outsider willing 
to take on the political Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"Please don't be rushed into this thing! Don't be steamrollered!" Bernardi 
bellowed to his fellow council members Thursday, expressing particular 
resentment at his longtime nemesis, public campaign financing. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter too has voiced trepidation about adopting the commission's proposals 
in total, arguing specifically that requiring up to 1,500 city employees to get 
the city's and the commission's permission to take a second job could violate 
their right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Many council members are said to privately share the concerns spoken by 
Bernardi and Galanter but have sat out the debate so far. Around City Hall, 
Galanter's role in particular has drawn quizzical expressions. Most figure that 
she is in the best position of any council member to articulate the concerns of 
her silent brethren. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just like Nixon going to China on this issue," said Chief Deputy City 
Atty. John Emerson, a political veteran who equated her role with that of the 
staunchly anti-Communist Republican President, whose overtures to a Communist 
nation were arguably better received than a Democrat's would have been. 
</P>
<P>
"Ruth Galanter can stand up and criticize an ethics package because there are 
few in government who are as conscientious as she," he added. "My sense is she 
is saying what a lot are thinking, but are wary of articulating in the context 
of ethics fever." 
</P>
<P>
But Galanter too is careful to note that her opposition is limited and she 
favors some reform. Other council members suggest that her current role as a 
lightning rod for debate on the issue is a dangerous one. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some political risk for her to be raising this," said Michael Woo, 
like Galanter a member of the council's ad hoc ethics committee. "She runs the 
risk of forfeiting the political capital she's raised." 
</P>
<P>
Woo and other council members have indicated they felt pressured to approve the 
commission's recommendations virtually before reading them, given the heated 
atmosphere surrounding the issue. Immediately after the commission issued its 
report in late November -- and before it wrote a draft ordinance that spelled 
out the reforms -- council members Gloria Molina and Marvin Braude endorsed the 
package. Their move, in effect, posed a challenge to the others. 
</P>
<P>
In his case, the ever-cautious Woo said he fears that by delaying an 
endorsement, he has stoked suspicions of himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it raised questions about . . . whether I as a councilman was less 
enthusiastic about ethics than others," said Woo, who said he is still forming 
his views on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Ethics reforms typically wind through legislative bodies at a snail's pace, as 
does any issue that touches immediately on the livelihoods of council members 
and their staffs. Indeed, the council ad hoc committee has been tied up for 
months in a dispute over a competing ethics package proposed by Woo, Braude and 
council President John Ferraro. Reforms aimed at regulating City Hall lobbyists 
languished for years before the council last week ordered the city attorney to 
draft new rules. And Bernardi sought for a decade to reform campaign financing 
before taking the matter, in initiative form, successfully to the voters in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
But any long-term delay on the new package has been virtually precluded by a 
deft political move by the ethics commission that issued the proposals. 
Geoffrey Cowan, the panel's chairman, vowed when he issued the report that if 
the council did not approve the package by February, the commission and 
prominent supporters would take the issue to the voters via an initiative. The 
group appears to have the financial resources to back up its threat. 
</P>
<P>
In the shorthand of a campaign, any reluctance to approve ethics reform could 
easily be construed as an anti-ethics position -- or so many officials fear. 
Cowan has indicated the commission will accept some changes in its plan, if 
they are deemed improvements, but he said the commission remains insistent that 
taxpayer financing of campaigns and the ban on outside income remain part of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had the council votes -- the "head count" in political 
parlance -- to guarantee approval of those reforms, Cowan smiled and pointedly 
reinforced the commission's threat. 
</P>
<P>
"In certain respects, my head count is the voters of Los Angeles," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan and those who support the commission's report argue that taxpayer 
financing is necessary to fight the public perception that council decisions 
are dramatically affected by campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Under the formula currently being considered, City Council candidates who are 
able to raise at least $25,000 on their own will be eligible for up to $133,000 
in matching city funds for each election. City attorney and controller 
candidates could receive up to $333,000 each and mayoral contenders up to 
$667,000 each in matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, council candidates who asked for public money would be 
limited to spending no more than $400,000 for each primary and general 
election, while city attorney and controller candidates would have to stop at 
$1 million and mayoral candidates at $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Cowan estimated that the financing would cost the city's taxpayers up 
to $2 million per year, in addition to the $1.8 million per year operating 
price tag for the city ethics commission. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said she is concerned that the costs could spiral. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has looked in any detail at what the costs will be," she said. "What 
the public is buying, when they write letters saying pass it, is (the council) 
writing a blank check." 
</P>
<P>
Another city official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity but who is 
familiar with council opinions about the proposed reforms, predicted that "the 
public financing of campaigns is going to be separated from the package." 
</P>
<P>
Tinkering with the proposed ban on outside income -- which is included in both 
the ethics commission report and the competing proposal drafted by Woo, Ferraro 
and Braude -- may prove more difficult, for it strikes at the heart of the 
criticism leveled at Mayor Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley initially came under fire for accepting payments from two financial 
institutions in exchange for serving as an adviser or director. Bradley 
acknowledged that it was a "mistake" to take the money from the firms when they 
were doing business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
One official who has followed the council's informal discussions referred to 
the ban as a "slam dunk" -- a move impossible to miss. Others suggest that the 
council members, many of whom distanced themselves from Bradley when the 
scandal broke, cannot possibly advocate anything but a ban on outside income 
because of the political implications. 
</P>
<P>
Council members privately say there are broad disagreements on those and some 
other specifics, but that most of the proposals stand a good chance of being 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that ethics reform is extraordinarily popular at this point 
in time -- and politicians certainly see that," said Mark Fabiani, Bradley's 
chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, and in marked contrast to the reaction the issue gets among elected 
officials here and elsewhere, council members report few expressions of 
interest from their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, they know that 'Ethics with a big E' is being talked about at City 
Hall," said Woo, whose council committee has been convulsed by the issue since 
spring. "I don't find an enormous amount of public interest."

RULING BACKS U.S. FORCES' POLICE ROLE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: LEGAL OPINION SUPPORTS OVERSEAS ARRESTS. DRUG TRAFFICKERS, 
TERRORISTS WOULD BE TARGETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. military forces have the legal authority to conduct law enforcement 
operations outside the United States, including pursuing and apprehending 
international terrorists and drug traffickers, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh's top 
legal adviser has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
In a Nov. 3 memorandum that opens the door to direct participation by the 
military in stepped-up offensives in other nations, Assistant Atty. Gen. 
William P. Barr concluded that a Reconstruction Era ban on such involvement was 
not intended to apply outside U.S. borders. 
</P>
<P>
Barr's ruling, first reported Saturday by the Washington Post and confirmed by 
Administration sources, was made after questions were raised about the 
military's authority to arrest Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega if a coup 
attempt against him were successful. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 28-page legal opinion cleared the way for such action, 
Administration officials emphasized that a policy decision "at the highest 
inter-agency levels" would be required before the military embarked on any law 
enforcement mission in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we may have the legal right to do some things, we may not -- for 
political reasons -- want to exercise all those rights," a senior Defense 
Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Barr opinion had led to specific military actions, such as in 
the escalating offensive against South American cocaine traffickers, one 
Administration source declined to comment, while another said: "Not to my 
knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling could remove potential obstacles to the involvement of U.S. military 
forces in the escalating offensive against cocaine producers and traffickers in 
the South American nations of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops have been deployed to South America to work with local officials as 
part of an "Andean initiative" contained in President Bush's anti-drug program, 
but their ability to apprehend traffickers was not clearly established until 
Barr's opinion was issued. 
</P>
<P>
However, any direct involvement by U.S. military personnel in the 
drug-producing nations would be certain to provoke significant nationalist 
opposition within those countries by citizens who view the U.S. involvement 
with suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
The memorandum on law enforcement actions by military personnel addresses a 
different legal question than a controversial June 21 opinion by Barr that said 
the FBI had authority to seize fugitives overseas without obtaining permission 
of the foreign government. 
</P>
<P>
And the assurances made by Administration officials that military actions would 
not be undertaken without prior approval at high levels illustrates their 
sensitivity to congressional criticism of the earlier opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department declined to make public Barr's latest ruling, just as it 
had the June 21 opinion, on grounds that the documents constitute "private 
communications" between Barr and his "client" -- Thornburgh, and, through him, 
President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
But an Administration official said Barr's latest written ruling was in line 
with a verbal opinion that his office of legal counsel had formulated during 
the Ronald Reagan Administration before Barr joined the government. 
</P>
<P>
"OLC looked at the issue and wrote a rough first draft, but the issue abated," 
and the opinion was never completed, an Administration official said. He 
declined to explain the facts under consideration at that time, but he said the 
verbal opinion did not lead to any action by the military. 
</P>
<P>
Barr's opinion reviews the history of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, passed in 
response to opposition to military oversight of Reconstruction Era elections. 
The ruling concludes that the act sought to bar military interference in 
functions of the states and was not meant to address military actions in other 
countries, an Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
"All the legislative history (of the act) related to interference with the 
states, with the military in conflict with Americans that could undermine 
confidence in the military," he said. "It was not Congress' intent for it to 
apply extraterritorially." 
</P>
<P>
Until recent years, the Pentagon had avoided any involvement in the fight 
against drugs entering the United States by citing the ban on military 
involvement in civilian law enforcement. But during the Reagan Administration, 
the act was amended to permit the use of the military for intelligence in drug 
interception along U.S. borders. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has invited proposals for broader military 
involvement in anti-drug efforts, and he has been considering initiatives 
submitted by the 10 principal U.S. military field commanders. 
</P>
<P>
Several of these proposals "pushed the envelope on what we could or could not 
do" in fighting drug trafficking, a senior Pentagon official said. He added 
that Cheney has rejected some of the proposals on grounds that they went too 
far. 
</P>
<P>
Doubts over the military's limited powers in battling drugs were raised during 
the Noriega coup attempt. Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of U.S. forces in 
Panama, felt it necessary to have a federal law enforcement agent standing by 
in case the coup succeeded and Noriega could be arrested on federal narcotics 
charges he faces in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The White House then sought clarification of the limitations, which resulted in 
Barr's opinion, an Administration source said.

ANITA DEFRANTZ LOOKS AT VACANT LOTS AND EMPTY SCHOOLYARDS AND SEES A WAY TO 
HEAL COMMUNITIES. AS KEEPER OF THE OLYMPIC SURPLUS, SHE HAS THE MONEY TO MAKE 
IT POSSIBLE.

<P>
Through the covetous eyes of Anita DeFrantz, the woman who presides over 
Southern California's $90-million share of the 1984 Olympic surplus, parking 
lots appear as soccer fields in waiting, locked schoolyards are wasted 
community parks, and gymnasiums in gang territory -- these are untapped 
treasures, potential 24-hour shelters from the violence outside. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard about a program in Maryland called the 'midnight leagues,' where 
kids can play basketball through the night," DeFrantz was telling the director 
of just such a gymnasium in Mona Park near Compton, scanning the rickety 
facility as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but I tell you," the gang-wise director said doubtfully, "that would be 
like putting targets on their backs." 
</P>
<P>
"What they were saying," DeFrantz persisted, patiently but emphatically, "is it 
gave them someplace to go. It's down the road, but it's a possibility. It's 
tough, but these facilities are here. And we ought to use them." 
</P>
<P>
DeFrantz, a 37-year-old Santa Monica resident, is widely recognized as one of 
the most powerful women in sports. A bronze medalist rower in the 1976 
Olympics, DeFrantz led an unsuccessful fight to overturn the U.S. boycott of 
the 1980 Moscow games. In 1984, she served as a prominent member of Peter 
Ueberroth's team of Olympic organizers, and she since has been elected to the 
International Olympic Committee, one of two U.S. members on the prestigious 
panel. She also sits on the executive board of the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
While her stature in sports is international, it is Southern California that 
has provided DeFrantz with a living laboratory to develop and test her theories 
on the societal possibilities of sport. For the last two years, DeFrantz has 
served as president of the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles (AAF), 
the organization that manages the region's share of a $250-million surplus 
generated by the 1984 Games -- money that Ueberroth promised throughout would 
go only to "kids." 
</P>
<P>
With this sizable stake and her crusader-like zeal, DeFrantz has set out to 
demonstrate that sports, properly organized and executed, can unite cities torn 
apart by crime and poverty, and can rescue children who might otherwise be lost 
to street-gang warfare -- or just simply lost. She intends to expand on the 
bromide that sports builds character: envisioning community sports clubs that 
become central forces within neighborhoods, and sports activities that are 
elevated into outdoor classrooms, teaching children mathematics as they score a 
baseball game, geometry as they race a sailboat. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when children in Los Angeles all too frequently fall victim to crack 
cocaine or rifle blasts, the notion that salvation might somehow be found in 
dribbling basketballs or running wind sprints is not an easy sell, yet DeFrantz 
keeps selling. 
</P>
<P>
"We know now that they take part in gangs," she said in an interview. "We know 
now that they use drugs, that they're teen mothers. So why don't we try 
something that gives these kids an opportunity to choose? There's much that can 
be done for our community through sports. Sports provides a basic tenet of our 
society, being successful." 
</P>
<P>
DeFrantz can transform venues as varied as an international sports forum in 
Athens, a dinner gathering in West Los Angeles and a high school in downtown 
Los Angeles into pulpits from which she makes her case. And whether she is 
speaking to one of the studio moguls that sit on her board, or a member of 
European royalty at an IOC function, or a South-Central Los Angeles community 
activist who has come seeking grant money, the message is always the same -- 
what sports can do for our children. 
</P>
<P>
Trained as a lawyer, DeFrantz speaks her mind softly but with authority, 
sprinkling the words and anecdotes of Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman 
and film maker Spike Lee with her own. At 5 feet, 11 inches, she has a 
commanding physical presence. 
</P>
<P>
DeFrantz also advances her philosophy through the foundation's awarding of 
grants to existing organizations and through the creation of its own programs, 
which include an effort to train coaches to bring children broader lessons 
about sport. 
</P>
<P>
She travels Southern California in a black Buick Park Avenue, dropping in on 
programs the foundation has financed and exploring potential sites for more 
activities, and in her rounds DeFrantz has collected many horror stories. She 
has seen poor children who make do with a soda can for a baseball bat, who play 
soccer with a bundle of rags as the ball. She has seen children "with shoes 
that don't come close to fitting, who don't have the energy to play because 
they're not getting enough to eat." 
</P>
<P>
These, more than anyone, are the children DeFrantz wants to reach with the 
Olympic surplus. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to make the playing field level," she said, "so anybody can walk on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
DeFrantz, a single woman with no children, seems to know a lot about kids, and 
gives them an uncommon measure of respect. 
</P>
<P>
"I was once a child," she said, laughing. "And I have very vivid memories of 
what that was like." 
</P>
<P>
She speaks softly of a childhood spent in segregated Indianapolis, Ind., of 
being a little girl of no more than 9 or 10, swimming on a team at the 
Frederick Douglass swimming pool. Her father, a community activist, held big 
dreams that his only daughter would one day plunge across the color line and 
into Olympic history by becoming the first African American to win an Olympic 
gold medal in swimming. 
</P>
<P>
But there wasn't much time to practice in a segregated pool closed nine months 
of the year, and DeFrantz remembers how difficult it was to compete with white 
children who practiced year-round. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that the kids at the Riviera Country Club had something I was being 
excluded from," she said. "I think my passion comes partly from denial. . . . I 
know that I missed out on something. That's why I crusade for kids to have it.' 
</P>
<P>
It is a long way from Frederick Douglass pool in Indianapolis to the swank 
Sports Club LA in West Los Angeles, where on a recent night DeFrantz could be 
found addressing the Stanford Professional Women of Los Angeles County. The 
audience of about 30 career women, most of them white, had come expecting a 
feminist theme. DeFrantz, however, stuck mainly to sports, although she added 
some twists that seemed to draw in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to make sure the youth are taken care of," DeFrantz told them. 
"I hope some of you in this room got the chance to take part in sports when you 
were young. If you did, you can think about that one moment when everything 
worked. When you caught the pass. 
</P>
<P>
"Each man has that moment," she continued. "We want to make sure no girl in 
this community is denied that moment." 
</P>
<P>
DeFrantz herself graduated with honors from Connecticut College, where, she 
recalled pointedly, she played her first organized baseball game. She earned a 
law degree at the University of Pennsylvania, and at the same time won a spot 
on the 1976 Olympic rowing team. She was also prepared to compete in the 1980 
Moscow Games and her efforts to overturn the U.S. boycott gained her 
international notice and were honored by the IOC. It also prompted a call from 
Ueberroth, and before long DeFrantz was employed by the L.A. Olympic Organizing 
Committee. She has been a resident of Southern California ever since. 
</P>
<P>
She works now out of the Britt House, a 79-year-old restored home on West Adams 
Boulevard that serves as the AAF headquarters. Since 1985, the AAF has provided 
more than $16 million worth of grants to 276 athletic organizations and 
programs, with an emphasis on sports activities that benefit girls, the poor 
and the handicapped. The grant money mainly has been drawn from interest and 
investments generated by the surplus, which remains intact at about $90 
million. 
</P>
<P>
DeFrantz, who was with AAF from the start and became president two years ago, 
was a leading proponent of the idea that the foundation should do more than 
simply pass out grants. Rather, DeFrantz believes, the Olympic legacy should be 
used to create what she and others call a "sports renaissance." 
</P>
<P>
It was a new concept to some, a little difficult to understand. "It took time 
to really come to grips with everything; it was a new approach," said board 
member William Robertson, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles 
County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. Robertson serves along with television 
producer David L. Wolper, who is chairman of the AAF board, Mayor Tom Bradley, 
Los Angeles Dodgers President Peter O'Malley, entertainment executive Lew 
Wasserman and 12 others. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Montiel, who worked with DeFrantz in helping create the AAF and now 
serves as president of the Institute for Journalism Education, recalled that 
she "talked about sport in a way I had not heard sport talked about before . . 
. (and) the light went on." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most ambitious elements of the DeFrantz vision is sports clubs, 
which she views as community centerpieces, "providing opportunities where there 
are none. (They can) bring communities together and develop traditions in 
communities that don't have tradition; develop infrastructures in communities 
that don't have infrastructures." 
</P>
<P>
The AAF sports clubs, to be situated initially in the Mar Vista Gardens and 
Jordan Downs housing projects, Mona Park near Compton and Southwest Community 
College, are based loosely on a club system prevalent in Eastern Europe, where 
children are exposed to sports at an early age and throughout their teen years. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike their European counterparts, where children are often groomed to be 
Olympians, the primary goal of the AAF sports clubs will be to introduce 
athletics to communities that would normally have little opportunity for 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an era where kids are struggling to find things to tie them to a 
community," DeFrantz said. "One thing I heard about Los Angeles before I came 
here was nobody knows their neighbors. Finding things that can bring people 
together is important . . . (and) education is one way. Sports is another. 
</P>
<P>
"I think with such a culturally diverse community, you can't expect everybody 
to go to the same church as they might in rural America. We need ties that run 
through and connect. And what better way to tie those people together than 
through our children?" 
</P>
<P>
The clubs would operate out of existing facilities in low-income neighborhoods 
with a goal of economic self-sufficiency. Children could join for a nominal 
fee. They would receive membership cards, uniforms and coaching, and would be 
allowed to participate in organized competition. The clubs would be run by 
community members. 
</P>
<P>
A special emphasis would be placed on ensuring that well-trained coaches 
supervise the activities, and that children be introduced to sports that 
otherwise might escape their interest. DeFrantz sees no reason why inner-city 
children should not be taught to fence, say, or even to sail. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the only club in operation meets weekly at Los Angeles Southwest 
Community College, where early on a recent Saturday about 30 children had 
gathered to perform warm-up calisthenics in the cool morning sunlight. And by 9 
a.m., braids flying in the breeze, sneakers beating against the dirt, the 
children were off and running around a former Olympic training track. 
</P>
<P>
They had come from throughout south Los Angeles, with some of the mothers 
arriving in hair rollers and sweats, a concession to the early start. The club 
had been meeting every Saturday morning since late last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a family thing over here at Southwest" said Barbara Edmonson, a mother 
who had brought five children, two of them her own, to the track. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Kelly, another mother, said she had noticed changes in her 14-year-old 
daughter and other children: "Things you thought you never could do they find 
they can. And when you accomplish small things, the bigger things get easier, 
and you go through life with the attitude that you can do whatever you want. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not ghetto-blasting, pants-sagging kids," she said, proudly. "They 
want to look good. They have pride in themselves." 
</P>
<P>
It is DeFrantz's dream that sports clubs like Southwest "will endure and 
eventually become intergenerational," and that the system might one day be 
exported to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
She believes that sports clubs offer something different than such established 
programs as the YMCA and Boys' Clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"The Boys' Clubs and YMCAs have general programs," she said. "Our sole focus is 
on sports. Our clubs belong to the community and represent the community's 
desires. It's not some association coming in and setting its philosophy down on 
a community. It's a chance for the community to own something of its own." 
</P>
<P>
It is DeFrantz's belief that sports are a mirror of society, and that 
athletics, like any other educational tool or service -- be it good schools or 
decent social programs -- are often denied to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get the city to do what it should be doing in the poor areas," 
she was telling one of her staff members at the Britt House one afternoon. 
"This system is designed to destroy the poor parts. We're trying to show that 
anybody can do this with the proper support. 
</P>
<P>
"You can look at sports and see how just a society is," she later elaborated. 
"Sports initially were segregated by economics and they still are by virtue of 
access. . . . We want to make sure every young person in Southern California 
has a chance to experience what sports has to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Although DeFrantz has particular concerns about poor children, she believes 
that all youth should have access to sport, and AAF grants. The foundation, she 
said, attempts to spread the surplus among all Southern California communities. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it a birthright," she said. "It comes with being human. . . . Some kids 
with less may need it more, but they should all have it. That's my philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
DeFrantz spends most of her time on the hunt for new program ideas, new ways to 
get children interested in a wide variety of sports, new places to put 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Our vision," she said, "is to have every sports facility being used all the 
time." She gains inspiration from a basketball tournament staged in a Santa 
Monica parking lot. "I figured if they could do it, we could. . . . That's 
another resource -- parking lots -- where we can put major events, like soccer 
which can be played on asphalt." 
</P>
<P>
Schoolyards locked shut over weekends and after dark trouble her: "We have 
schools that are locked up and closed as many hours as they're open. The 
facility is there 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and the community needs to 
feel it owns the school, (and should be allowed) to utilize its gymnasium, its 
playing field -- when the administrators go home." 
</P>
<P>
The AAF lobbies schools to keep facilities unlocked and supervised after school 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
In DeFrantz's view, sports offers untapped educational opportunities. While she 
stressed that games are no substitute for schoolwork, the two can complement 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid who is good in math," she said, "could be superb in sailing, figuring 
out the vectors and angles. The kid who loves baseball and keeps the statistics 
may not know she'll be the next physics whiz." 
</P>
<P>
Sports can also teach patience, she said, and other important lessons not 
taught in classrooms -- or on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids grow up thinking everything is immediate," DeFrantz said. "That's one 
of the things about gangs. Gangs have no sense of the future. It's all now 
because most of those kids don't make it into the future." 
</P>
<P>
Given a chance to be a part of a team, she said, children "have a sense of 
history. They know things progress from one game to the next. And they are 
people who respect the human capability of excellence." 
</P>
<P>
So far, community reaction to the AAF approach seems positive, although 
everyone -- including DeFrantz -- agrees that the foundation has just begun to 
become a presence. 
</P>
<P>
Recreation directors in low-income neighborhoods that have been chosen as 
sports club sites said they did not have to be sold on the value of athletics 
as an anti-gang tool. Even some of the gang members seem to respect the 
potential of sports. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a saying among the older guys that athletes are off-limits," said 
Glenda Howry, who has been director of the Jordan Downs housing project 
recreation center for five years. "If they find out a kid is halfway good in a 
sport and trying to excel," they leave the child alone. "I guess they feel 
that's their only way out." 
</P>
<P>
DeFrantz, a patient crusader, said she sees an energy growing: "It becomes a 
synergy. This isn't tomorrow or next month. It's 10 years from now. But if we 
want the energy to go into the 21st Century, now's the time to turn up the 
voltage." 
</P>
<P>
Reality, though, can throw up high hurdles. In Mona Park gym, director Winston 
Phillips still had trouble swallowing the notion of staging basketball games 
there in the middle of the night. He thought that at a minimum it would be 
necessary to post a police guard. 
</P>
<P>
"We could (try) it," Phillips said. "But we'd have to have a car stationed 
here, because if the rival gang members got the word, there could be trouble." 
</P>
<P>
That the gym director agreed to at least consider a midnight basketball league 
seemed to satisfy DeFrantz, for the moment. She walked outside the gym and 
watched as a swarm of tiny children played together on swings in the sand. She 
lingered over the scene of happy commotion for several minutes, smiling.

SPECIAL REPORT ON EASTERN EUROPE; 
</P>
<P>
THE CURTAIN RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a year of upheaval and raw emotion, spectacle and collapse. For the 
nations of the East Bloc, it was a year that neither those in power nor those 
outside it could even vaguely have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
In five of the bloc's six countries -- Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, 
Bulgaria and Hungary -- a peaceful revolution of historic magnitude broke the 
spine of communism. 
</P>
<P>
The Curtain Rises: Eastern Europe, 1989, a special 14-page report in today's 
editions, explains and analyzes the events that have led to this new-found 
freedom with such breathtaking swiftness. 
</P>
<P>
Step by step, the report takes you through this amazing tale of refugee flight, 
political maneuvering and street protests by hundreds of thousands -- and in 
the process looks at how Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev unleashed the 
forces of reform in the East Blocand what lies ahead in the perilous 1990s.

'MINE OF TEARS' CONFLICT IMPERILS PAPUA NEW GUINEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PANGUNA, Papua New Guinea 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tribes on Bougainville Island speak 19 languages, but they use English to 
describe the giant Panguna copper mine in the center of the island's vast 
jungles. 
</P>
<P>
They call it the "mine of tears." 
</P>
<P>
Panguna is one of the world's biggest open-pit mines: Gargantuan shovels have 
turned a small mountain into a gaping gray hole nearly a mile and a half across 
and half a mile deep -- so huge that torrential rains sometimes drench one side 
while the sun bakes the other. 
</P>
<P>
The Bougainville mine is the focus of a year-old secessionist war that 
threatens the economic and political future of the South Pacific's largest and 
most mineral-rich country. 
</P>
<P>
It is a small war -- but a costly one. At least 45 people, mostly civilians, 
have been axed or shot to death on Bougainville. Soldiers and police officers 
have burned 1,600 homes and created 15,000 refugees, according to government 
reports. And the mine, the country's largest revenue source, has been closed 
since May. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time Papua New Guinea has experienced internal armed 
rebellion," Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu said. 
</P>
<P>
A former adviser agreed: "For the first time, Papua New Guinea is writing its 
history in blood." 
</P>
<P>
Independent since 1975, the former Australian territory is a nation like no 
other. Largely uncharted and unknown until World War II, Papua New Guinea is 
home to about 1,000 tribes that speak nearly as many languages. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 3.7 million people live as their ancestors did, as subsistence 
farmers in jungle hamlets outside the cash economy. They have one of the 
world's highest infant mortality rates and lowest life expectancies. 
</P>
<P>
And change is not coming easily. Highland warriors in feathers and mud now use 
shotguns as well as spears in traditional tribal fights. Others dip arrows in 
DDT and other modern poisons. 
</P>
<P>
But 1989 has brought special strains. In Port Moresby, the capital, soldiers 
smashed windows in Parliament to demand higher pay. Crowds rioted over reports 
that government officials had appeared in pornographic films. At other mines, 
there was sabotage and strikes. 
</P>
<P>
The second-largest city, Lae, is under police curfew because of roving gangs of 
thugs called "rascals." Violent crime is so common that auto rental agencies 
warn visitors not to stop in the event of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a marked escalation of tension, of violence, and a perception that 
the government is not in control," said a Western diplomat whose wife was 
recently attacked. 
</P>
<P>
But Bougainville tops the list of trouble spots. Prime Minister Namaliu calls 
the rebellion the worst crisis in the nation's young history. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one hell of an experience," he said in an interview. "We've never had 
anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, closing the mine wiped out 45% of the country's export earnings and 17% 
of national revenues. If it cannot reopen, the government faces financial 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"Investors are obviously worried," another Western diplomat said. "Next year's 
budget is already worthless." 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to end the impasse, the government decided in late November to reassign 
its 800 troops on Bougainville from chasing rebels to guarding the mine in an 
attempt to restart operations. But the militants dynamited a communications 
tower a week later, cutting the island's telephone and telex links. 
</P>
<P>
Bougainville has always been special. The dark Melanesians here proudly call 
themselves "blackskins" and scorn other Papua New Guineans as "redskins." Many 
first called for secession 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The current conflict goes further back. In 1972, the Australian-owned 
Bougainville Copper Ltd. began mining low-grade ore in the rugged mountains 16 
miles from the coast. The colonial-era agreement paid 58% of the profits to the 
national government, with only 5% to the province and 1% to the tribes that 
traditionally owned the land. There was discontent from the start. 
</P>
<P>
"From the landowners' perspective, they've given tremendous riches from their 
land and received a pittance in exchange," said Graeme Kemelfield, head of 
Bougainville's University Center. 
</P>
<P>
Each share diminished as the tribes tripled in size. Villages never got 
promised roads or clinics. Deadlines on revising the agreement were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Anger boiled over in November, 1988, when the company denied killing fish in 
the once-rich Jaba River. Mine tailings had turned the river into liquid mud. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the militants) said it defiled the sacred nature of the land," a 
resident said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, former mine surveyor Francis Ona led a raid on company 
stores to steal dynamite. Within weeks, the rebels had blown up electric power 
pylons and attacked mine workers. In March, they burned the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"Hardly a day goes by when someone isn't getting injured, attacked or killed," 
said Colin Evanson, a spokesman for Bougainville Copper. "Plus, they've caused 
hundreds of millions in damages and lost revenues." 
</P>
<P>
Ona's Bougainville Revolutionary Army now has as many as 300 men, officials 
say. Most are armed with bows and four-foot arrows, or aging shotguns that fire 
lead fishing sinkers. But several use M-16 assault rifles and an M-79 grenade 
launcher stolen from the military. 
</P>
<P>
In September, masked rebels shot and killed John Bika, the provincial minister, 
in his living room, as his wife and children looked on. Bika had advocated 
statehood, not secession. 
</P>
<P>
"The militants have done ritual killings as well," a military officer said. 
"They've chopped ears and fingers off, shot at ambulances, threatened hospital 
workers." 
</P>
<P>
Government forces are little better. When a wounded soldier died in Arawa 
General Hospital recently, four angry friends threatened to shoot the nurses in 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"The riot police acted like pigs from the start," company spokesman Evanson 
complained. "They burned 1,600 houses. No single natural disaster in Papua New 
Guinea has ever caused that kind of damage." 
</P>
<P>
One victim was Joseph Kabui, premier of the province. In July, police beat 
Kabui unconscious and blinded an aide in one eye by poking gun barrels in his 
face. The police accused the pair of secretly supporting the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"They forced me to lick up the blood of a policeman who had been shot that 
morning," Kabui said. 
</P>
<P>
The brutality only increased support for the rebels, said Roman Catholic Bishop 
Gregory Singkai, who has acted as go-between in peace negotiations. "It's very 
stupid, burning and bashing and killing people. The militants, if they kill 
anybody, it's in self-defense, because they are being hunted." 
</P>
<P>
The government has put 3,829 refugees in 19 camps since July. Several hundred 
live in blue plastic shelters at the Hookings camp in Arawa, the provincial 
seat. Barbed wire and armed guards keep refugees in and outsiders away. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody says these are prison camps," said camp coordinator Steven Kewaka. 
"That isn't true. These are care centers." 
</P>
<P>
No guards patrol the Biruana camp, five miles away in the jungle. Soldiers 
forced about 200 people there from Topinang and Amion villages after rebels 
were reported nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Near the refugees' huts, rice and boxes of canned meat and fish were stacked in 
a shed. Children played in the mud, and village elders smoked pipes in the 
shade. Several said the camp was livable -- but not home. 
</P>
<P>
"All our gardens are gone," a 40-year-old man complained. "We have no privacy. 
And why? We did nothing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The rebels demand independence for Bougainville, $11.5 billion for 
environmental damage and an end to the mining. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have repeatedly failed. In October, the prime minister flew to 
Arawa to offer a $240-million aid package. He and tribal landowners shook hands 
over a pig, broke a bow and arrow and chewed betel nut in a traditional peace 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
But even as they met, rebels ambushed an army patrol. And in a fiery radio 
address, Ona denounced any compromise as "rubbish and dust." 
</P>
<P>
"The peace initiatives all lack one thing," one frustrated resident said. "The 
leader of the rebels is still in the bush and hasn't changed his demands." 
</P>
<P>
The mine's work force has shrunk from 4,000 to 1,700. Many foreigners have 
fled. Company officials will soon decide whether to shut down the mine and cut 
the staff to 350. 
</P>
<P>
Such dire prospects are hotly debated over cold South Pacific beer at the 
rundown hotels and bars of Arawa, where burly Australians in shorts and 
knee-length socks gather before the nightly curfew. 
</P>
<P>
"This will become a ghost town," one businessman said. "Businesses will close. 
Schools will cut back. It's a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Another noted that several Australian coast watchers -- who warned the Allies 
of Japanese air raids -- eluded Japanese troops for years in Bougainville's 
thick jungles during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Middlemiss, a 27-year resident who runs the local newsstand, figures the 
rebels are doing even better. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got the government on the run," he said. "Are they winning? Of course 
they're winning."

CRANSTON'S PROMISE ON BONDS TOLD;

<P>
S&amp;L SCANDAL: SENATOR'S APPEARANCE AT MEETING DISRUPTED BY LEADER OF GROUP 
THAT LOST MILLIONS IN LINCOLN SAVINGS FAILURE.

<P>
Shirley Lampel, an outspoken leader of more than 23,000 investors who purchased 
now-worthless junk bonds at Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan offices, said Saturday 
she has won a pledge from Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) to assist them in their 
efforts to get their money back. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston made the promise during a 10-minute private session with Lampel Friday 
night in Orange County. Cranston met with the 58-year-old Tustin woman after 
she disrupted a forum on women's issues that the senator hosted at a high 
school in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way I can get ahold of you," Lampel had shouted at Cranston 
from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Lampel gained prominence last month when she and two other bondholders 
testified before the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee that 
they held Cranston personally responsible for their losses. 
</P>
<P>
The three represented more than 23,000 people -- most of them elderly 
Californians -- who lost an estimated $220 million by investing in bonds issued 
by Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp., which has filed for 
bankruptcy court protection. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston was one of five senators who had intervened with federal regulators on 
behalf of Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr. during a 1987 investigation of 
the Irvine thrift. Keating contributed $1.4 million to the senators' campaigns 
and other causes they supported. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have charged that Lincoln would have been seized by the government in 
1987 if the senators had not intervened in the case. By the time the government 
finally took control last April, the Irvine thrift had piled up more than $2 
billion in federally insured losses. 
</P>
<P>
The five senators, whose intervention is being investigated by law enforcement 
authorities and the Senate Ethics Committee, have denied responsibility for the 
losses incurred by taxpayers or by the elderly bondholders. 
</P>
<P>
While Lampel still blames Cranston for her misfortune, she emerged from the 
meeting with a much kinder view of the senator than she had expressed earlier. 
A Democrat and former Cranston supporter, she said she was treated with 
courtesy by the senator and his aides. 
</P>
<P>
"I elicited a promise that he's going to be active in helping the bondholders," 
Lampel said in a telephone interview. She said she was "absolutely positive" 
that the 76-year-old senator will keep his promise because his political future 
may depend on it. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's popularity in California has slumped dramatically in recent weeks as 
a result of his involvement in the Lincoln scandal. A recent Times Poll found 
that his favorable rating had fallen to 32% from 56% last October. 
</P>
<P>
Lampel said she warned Cranston that he had better live up to his promise to 
help the bondholders if he expects to be reelected to a fifth term in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to him last night, 'You've got two years. A lot of good can be done in 
the next two years. You can turn it around,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lampel said she felt "absolutely positive" Cranston would keep the pledge to 
help the bondholders because she received the telephone number of one of his 
aides, who invited her to call at any time. "I now have access to the senator," 
she asserted. 
</P>
<P>
She said Cranston's aides had promised to contact her again in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston did not tell Lampel precisely what he intended to do to help the 
bondholders, but he mentioned that he has asked the General Accounting Office 
to investigate whether federal regulators can be held responsible for allowing 
the bonds to be sold at Lincoln offices. The GAO is the investigative arm of 
the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
If the GAO finds that the federal government failed to properly regulate the 
bond sales, Cranston has said he will press for government repayment of the 
bondholders. Meanwhile, the bondholders also are pressing lawsuits seeking 
restitution from Keating and Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Lampel said she felt bad about disrupting Cranston's meeting at Century High 
School, but she knew of no other way to get an opportunity to talk with the 
senator. She said she was very nervous about sitting down with the powerful 
senator, but she forced herself to do it because she believes the other 
bondholders are looking to her to speak for them. 
</P>
<P>
"I made up my mind that no matter how my heart pounded, I would not run from 
the room," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lampel was not the only citizen who disrupted Cranston's meeting. Shortly after 
Cranston opened the forum, which was attended by about 40 people, a small group 
of conservative Republican youths threw bogus $100 bills at the stage and 
shouted, "Have some more money senator; that's the only way you listen."

DEUKMEJIAN HITS POLITICS OF ABORTION

Gov. George Deukmejian called on fellow politicians Saturday to stop 
"exploiting" the abortion issue and trying to "tailor" their views to fit the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran officeholder, who is not running for reelection next year, 
criticized Democratic candidates who have "castigated" the opposing views of 
Republican rivals. And he denounced fellow Republicans who have reversed 
long-held views and adopted "supposedly more fashionable" positions. 
</P>

"Abortion is a moral issue," Deukmejian declared in his weekly radio address. 
"It should not be exploited for political gain. Nor should one's views on the 
subject be changed or tailored to suit what the conventional wisdom says is the 
prevailing popular will." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's own views on abortion are complex, as are those of most Americans, 
according to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
The governor is not "pro-choice," but neither is he strictly "anti-abortion." 
As he restated in his radio address, Deukmejian opposes "abortion on demand," 
but supports it in cases of "rape or incest or where there is a substantial 
risk to the mother's physical or mental health." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's admonishment to politicians came at a time when his own party has 
been taking a drubbing on abortion, nationally and in California. 
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey and Virginia last month, for example, pro-choice Democrats 
defeated anti-abortion Republicans in gubernatorial races. In San Diego on Dec. 
5, a pro-choice Democratic assemblywoman upset an anti-abortion Republican 
assemblywoman in a state Senate race after a Catholic bishop inadvertently 
whipped up backlash support for the Democrat by barring her from receiving 
Communion. 
</P>
<P>
In each gubernatorial contest, the GOP candidate backpedaled on the abortion 
issue and softened his position -- a tactic that Deukmejian said not only 
doesn't work, it repels voters. 
</P>
<P>
"I have found that voters will respect a candidate or public official who 
states his or her views sincerely and consistently, even if they happen to 
disagree on a particular controversial issue," the governor said. "Voters will 
not respect -- and are likely not to support -- those who expediently change 
their position on such a deep moral question as abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"The best course is to state your views with clarity and consistency, refrain 
from exploiting the views of opponents and trust the people to respect the fact 
that you have taken a stand on a tough issue and that you aren't wishy-washy." 
</P>
<P>
Led by former President Ronald Reagan, the GOP in recent years became widely 
viewed as the "anti-abortion" party. In fact, its 1988 national platform 
contained a "right-to-life" plank advocating a ban on abortions. 
</P>
<P>
But many Republican officeholders now are trying to withdraw the party from 
that hardrock position and broaden its image. Watching polls and election 
results, they see the political pendulum swinging toward "pro-choice" -- as 
largely advocated by Democrats -- after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision 
in July that opened the way for states to restrict abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"We should just take the abortion issue out of the platform. I feel the 
Republican Party needs to be opened up and become very broadly-based," 
Assemblywoman Carol Bentley (R-El Cajon), the anti-abortion candidate who lost 
narrowly in the San Diego election, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian did not say exactly to whom he was referring when he lamented that 
"in recent weeks, a number of political observers and analysts have attempted 
to turn this sensitive moral question into a simple political calculation. Some 
Democratic candidates . . . have been advised to promote their views on 
abortion and castigate the views of their opponents. Some Republicans are being 
advised to simply discard their strongly-held positions on abortion in order to 
conform to supposedly more fashionable views." 
</P>
<P>
Although the governor was not specific, there seem to be ample illustrations in 
California of what he was talking about. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San Diego), the pro-choice winner in San Diego, 
acknowledged on Saturday that she would not have entered the Senate race in a 
predominantly-Republican district had she not first taken a poll which showed 
that she could capitalize on, among other things, Bentley's anti-abortion 
views. "Pro-choice was the issue that most affected people's vote," said 
Killea, who personally opposes abortion. So she placed a television ad calling 
the voters' attention to her position compared to Bentley's. 
</P>
<P>
In a budding contest for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor 
between two state senators who are little known outside of their Orange County 
districts, one contender "after a lot of soul-searching" reversed his position 
in September and became "pro-choice." Sen. John Seymour of Anaheim defended his 
controversial switch on Saturday, saying the Supreme Court ruling had "changed 
the environment." 
</P>
<P>
"A person in public office can't be an ostrich with his head in the sand," 
asserted Seymour, who said he remains personally opposed to abortion. "The 
important thing that needs to be said is that this is not a Republican-Democrat 
issue. It is a personal issue." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour's opponent, Sen. Marion Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), said she will stick 
to her anti-abortion position, although it is hurting her politically. "I've 
had many people come up to me and indicate they can't support anyone who is not 
pro-choice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Californians have a lot of problems. We shouldn't be looking at any single 
issue to try to make a determination on a candidate." 
</P>
<P>
But what should be and what is are often different in politics. And it is much 
easier for the retiring governor to assert that abortion should not be 
exploited for political gain than it is for active candidates to put this 
thesis into practice. 
</P>
<P>
When running for reelection himself in 1986, for example, Deukmejian 
aggressively exploited the differences between himself and his Democratic 
opponent on another moral issue -- capital punishment. Deukmejian, a strong 
supporter of the death penalty, frequently accused Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley of "taking a walk" on the issue throughout his career.

SKI RESORTS FIND HELP 'DOWN UNDER'; 
</P>

RECREATION: ALONG WITH AUSSIE AND KIWI ACCENTS, SKIERS ALSO ARE ENCOUNTERING 
HIGHER PRICES FOR LIFT TICKETS, ICIER ROADS AND A PROLIFERATION OF PREVIOUSLY 
BANNED SNOW BOARDS.

<P>
With young ski bums fading from the scene -- another phenomenon of the aging 
American population -- California mountain resorts are reaching south for 
workers willing to endure low pay in order to ski for free all winter. 
</P>
<P>
"G'day mate," said Brian Ross, self-proclaimed "year-round skier" and part-time 
food server, sitting with friends inside the Bar of America here. He is one of 
300 or more Australians and New Zealanders imported for the season at Sierra 
ski areas. 
</P>
<P>
The "down under" English of the Aussies and Kiwis has -- along with $35 lift 
tickets, icier roads and the proliferation of snow boards -- dealt tradition a 
beating this ski season, which began before Thanksgiving at most Northern 
California resorts. 
</P>
<P>
In past winters, ski areas employed a few dozen Australians and New Zealanders, 
mostly as ski instructors. But this year the ski resorts have recruited 
overseas even for less-skilled jobs as groomers, lift operators and cafeteria 
workers -- with the blessing of U.S. and state labor officials. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that ski areas are finding it harder to entice Americans to take 
the low-paying, often bone-chilling jobs running lifts, grooming slopes and 
checking tickets. The work itself hasn't changed much. But there are fewer 
young people willing to endure the hardships, even for the chance to ski for 
free and enjoy a white Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"These ski resorts hire literally thousands of people in season, and the 
numbers (of job seekers) just aren't here," said Michael Henriques, Lake Tahoe 
manager of the state Employment Development Department. "Typically these ski 
jobs are filled by younger people. And there are just fewer 20-year-olds coming 
into the labor market." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Labor, which must certify that the foreign workers are 
necessary, began in late November to publicize that the jobs were going 
begging. But officials found little demand, even in the Truckee area, where the 
town's landmark sawmill closed down before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
"It puzzles us," said Paul Nelson, who oversees the foreign visa program for 
the Department of Labor in San Francisco. "We've had no one apply as a result 
of any publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Ski area managers say the shortage of workers has worsened steadily through the 
late 1980s. Low-paying employers in many parts of California face the same 
problem in attracting help, but it is more acute in resort areas such as the 
Lake Tahoe region, where casinos, motels and restaurants also compete for 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Ski areas have fought the trend with more aggressive recruiting and higher 
wages. During the summer, for example, Mammoth Mountain decided to increase 
wages by 20% for some jobs. A ski lift crew member with no experience makes $6 
an hour this season, up $1 from last season. (Lift prices also shot up by $5, 
to $35). 
</P>
<P>
"As recently as five years ago there were lines to get jobs here," said Mammoth 
personnel director John Denault. "Now we have to recruit." 
</P>
<P>
The supply of available, willing help has shrunk with the slow demise of the 
ski bum, that breed of American youth who would scrape by at odd jobs in order 
to ski their legs off all winter. Recruiters for the ski areas say they cannot 
find enough students and recent graduates who are willing to delay their 
careers to ski. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not giving themselves time to go off and play for awhile," said Tim 
Newhart, marketing director at Heavenly Valley, the large South Lake Tahoe ski 
area with slopes on both sides of the California-Nevada border. 
</P>
<P>
Heavenly Valley so far has hired about 65 workers from overseas, not a high 
percentage of its 1,200 employees, but more than in past years. Elsewhere in 
the Tahoe area, half a dozen smaller resorts have applied for government 
approval to hire more than 200 Australians and New Zealanders, and as many as 
100 may also be employed under cultural exchange programs. 
</P>
<P>
For the ski areas the imports are a near-perfect match. They speak English and 
treasure the free ski lift pass. "I like to ski -- and this lets me ski most of 
the year," said Ross, 24, who said he is from a small town outside Sydney. Like 
Ross, many come directly from a full winter of ski resort work in the Southern 
hemisphere and need little training. 
</P>
<P>
"They are generally the cream of the crop from Australian and New Zealand 
resorts," said Greg Peterman, vice president for human resources at Heavenly 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are also attractive to the resorts because they tend to stay until 
spring. Every January the ski areas are thrown into disarray when many of their 
American employees rush back to college campuses, an annual ritual that 
depletes the staff at a time when the snow is often good and crowds are high. 
</P>
<P>
"We lose about half our staff when school starts up in January," said Mammoth's 
Denault. "And it's real difficult to recruit in January." 
</P>
<P>
Besides recruiting in the Southern Hemisphere, ski areas are also trying a 
packet of other tactics to lure and keep more workers. Mammoth is helping 
underwrite the costs of community college classes to begin next month in 
Mammoth Lakes, the town at the foot of the ski area, in the hope of enticing 
more student workers to stay past January. 
</P>
<P>
Mammoth also offered more jobs to people whose usual employment gives them 
winters off -- seasonal forestry workers and, for the first time, to Southern 
California beach lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
Some ski areas also have been forced to help pay the housing costs of workers. 
Heavenly Valley bought an apartment building and displaced local residents to 
make room for ski area workers -- a controversial move in South Lake Tahoe, 
where new apartments have not been built in many years and where housing is at 
a premium. 
</P>
<P>
Northstar, a north Tahoe resort, recently took over a hilltop lodge in Truckee 
for its employees. Northstar also has arranged to exchange employees with 
summer resorts in the upper Midwest -- sending workers in summer to Mackinaw 
Island, Mich., and Brainard, Minn., and receiving workers in winter. But still, 
about 10% of Northstar's 800 employees are foreign, most of them exchange 
students and recent graduates from Australia, New Zealand and Europe, said 
personnel manager Jacquelyn Cleary. 
</P>
<P>
Besides hearing more Aussie accents, many skiers this season will also share 
the slopes with snow boards for the first time. Mammoth and most of the larger 
Tahoe ski areas -- which forbade snow boards in past years -- have opened their 
mountains to board riders, usually without restriction. 
</P>
<P>
In part, the ski areas have learned not to fear the "shredders," who carve 
turns down the slopes on boards that resemble a large skateboard. As with 
skateboards, the aficionados enjoy performing radical jumps and maneuvers, a 
practice that resorts feared would annoy family skiers. 
</P>
<P>
But the ski industry has lured fewer new customers in recent years, and snow 
boarders are now seen by many ski areas as their best opportunity for growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Snow boards are here to stay," said Tim Newhart, spokesman for Heavenly 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Another new feature in the Tahoe area this season is likely to be icier roads. 
After several thousand trees along Tahoe highways died last winter from tainted 
runoff water, the Legislature ordered the state Department of Transportation to 
use less salt on roads this winter. The salt melts snow and helps de-ice the 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
For motorists, the use of less salt and experiments with other chemicals are 
expected to require more use of tire chains.

EXPANSION OF TOKYO AIRPORT STILL GROUNDED BY MILITANT PROTESTERS; 
</P>
<P>
JAPAN: FARMERS REFUSE TO SELL THEIR LAND FOR NEW RUNWAYS. PASSENGERS USING 
CROWDED NARITA CAN EXPECT MORE FRUSTRATION.

NARITA, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many a visitor to Japan has a horror story, or two, to tell about Narita 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after arriving at the gateway to this land of affluence and high 
technology, the typical traveler must wade through endless lines at an 
immigration inspection, battle ludicrous crowds to board a limousine bus and 
grind molars during a frustrating two-hour freeway jam to a downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
It gets worse on the trip home. One-way taxi fare to the airport, built on 
farmland 40 miles east of Tokyo, easily exceeds $140. Police in full riot gear 
examine the bags of even the most unassuming tourist passing through a gate 
fortified with steel barricades and barbed wire. Inside the terminal lurk more 
nightmarish lines and security checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say they hope to fix the airport's crowding and transportation 
problems in a couple of years, once a new rail link, two additional runways and 
a second terminal building are completed. 
</P>
<P>
But nobody is betting on it. A handful of farmers are still growing vegetables 
on land that the bureaucrats sketched into their plans as new runways. Propped 
up by a bickering coalition of student radicals and professional protesters, 
these farmers refuse to sell their property, which the government has only 
limited powers to seize. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after nearly two decades of political stalemate and occasionally violent 
confrontation, tension is rising anew at Narita. The Transport Ministry invoked 
a special airport security law this month to deploy a brigade of 1,200 riot 
police and engineers with water cannons, cranes and bulldozers to tear down a 
"fortress" built by radical protesters on the disputed land. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders wearing helmets and masks threw firebombs from steel towers over 
their makeshift shack in a scene reminiscent of the fanatical protest movement 
that delayed the opening of the airport, first conceived in the mid-1960s, 
until 1978. Already, Phase 2 of the airport construction plan is more than a 
decade behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities did not report any serious injuries in the latest melee. But four 
police officers and two protesters were killed and scores of others were 
injured in violence during the initial stage of airport construction. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting is far from over. The Transport Ministry has threatened to 
forcibly dismantle several other fortress-like "solidarity huts" built by 
radicals over the years on the site. Protesters have vowed to dig in. 
</P>
<P>
No solution is in sight for Narita, dubbed the "one-lung airport" by the Asahi 
newspaper for its single runway and its woefully inadequate facilities. And 
even if construction went ahead smoothly, some observers doubt that the 
$2.9-billion expansion would be sufficient to meet Tokyo's needs very far into 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
In a rare sign of conciliation, Transport Minister Takami Eto issued his 
agency's first official apology recently for its failure to talk to local 
landowners before unveiling plans to build Narita back in 1966. That error in 
social consensus-building, Eto conceded, drove farmers into the arms of the 
radicals. 
</P>
<P>
It remains uncertain whether the government can correct its legacy of 
bureaucratic bungling and persuade the farmers to sell -- or use its powers of 
eminent domain to take their land without provoking further bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
A radical group called Chukakuha, or "Middle Core Faction," terrorized the 
citizens panel charged with overseeing eminent domain at the airport until the 
panel disbanded itself in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the eight farmers who cling to their land inside the expansion site 
endorse violence. In fact, protesting landowners have splintered into three 
major factions, only one of which remains aligned with Chukakuha. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Chukakuha is the dominant group among two dozen different sects from 
Japan's "new left" that joined the Narita protest, searching for a symbolic 
cause after mass movements against the Vietnam War and the Japan-U.S security 
alliance began to fizzle. Many of the student supporters who came here more 
than 20 years ago have settled down. 
</P>
<P>
To Naokatsu Ogawa, 45, a farmer who owns three acres on the expansion site, 
resisting the airport is as much a part of the life style he inherited from his 
father as tilling the land. 
</P>
<P>
Ogawa was 21 when the government shocked the local community with a fait 
accompli -- that a new international airport would be constructed in their 
midst. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like farming all that much -- I would have sold," Ogawa said during a 
recent interview in a shack on the construction site, where he and a band of 
supporters pack organic vegetables to be trucked to sympathetic consumers in 
Tokyo. "But my father was dead-set against the airport, so here I am." 
</P>
<P>
About 325 farm households in Ogawa's Sanrizuka hamlet were told in 1966 that 
they would have to move away from the plateau, a former imperial horse pasture 
that was opened to homesteading after World War II. About half sold out 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
But the rest were enraged by the attitude of Transport Ministry officials who 
decided to take their land without first consulting them. Mostly out of 
stubborn pride, they denounced the "arrogance of the state" and refused to 
budge. 
</P>
<P>
Many were persuaded to abandon the site during protracted negotiations that 
followed. The government ultimately used the special eminent-domain powers to 
evict die-hards living on the phase-one site, sparking battles in which both 
sides drew blood. 
</P>
<P>
Ogawa and the others living on the expansion site are resisting lucrative cash 
offers by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I've developed too many ties within the anti-airport league to quit now," 
Ogawa said. "People from the airport authority come around all the time and ask 
me to cooperate. I tell them I'm not interested." 
</P>
<P>
Makoto Tsubokawa, an official with the New Tokyo International Airport 
Authority, the agency in charge of Narita, said the government is promising to 
provide new farmland outside the area in addition to cash. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Tsubokawa said the protest movement has become so politicized that 
outside supporters block constructive dialogue with the farmers. About 56 
acres, or 4% of the construction site, remains in the hands of opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to talk directly to them any time, anywhere," Eto, the transport 
minister, told reporters. "I'm confident they can be convinced." 
</P>
<P>
But Ogawa, a member of the moderate Atsuta faction of the splintered 
anti-airport league, said he feels harassed by an atmosphere of intimidation 
that prevails in the construction zone. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we talk to them with all this barbed wire around here?" he said, 
gesturing toward a 10-foot steel fence topped with coiled barbs that the 
airport authority erected a few months ago next to his vegetable packing shed. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the fence is a moat and another steel fence. Beyond this 
is one of many watchtowers where riot police keep a 24-hour vigil with 
floodlights and binoculars. The fortress that police attacked early this month, 
belonging to the radical Battle Flag faction, stood just a few yards from 
Ogawa's shed. 
</P>
<P>
"The riot police stop and search us at every bend of the road, so we can't go 
about our business," Ogawa said. "I'm not a radical student. I'm just a hick 
from a farm village, but they're still searching my car." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the existing facilities at Narita face inexorable pressure for 
expansion. The airport, conceived before anyone predicted Japan's economic boom 
or the advent of nonstop, long-distance jumbo jets, handles two-thirds of the 
country's flights and more than 80% of its international cargo. With its single 
runway, it already ranks first among the world's airports in cargo volume and 
eighth in the number of international passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Use of the existing terminal already exceeds its original design capacity of 13 
million passengers a year by nearly 50%. And flights are up 14% this year to 
about 330 daily, a considerable strain on resources because of an 11 p.m.-to-6 
a.m. curfew aimed at curbing complaints about noise. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign airlines bemoan the shortage of terminal gates -- most airliners must 
park on the tarmac and passengers are bused to and from the terminal. Baggage 
handling facilities are inadequate. Narita's fuel and operating costs are the 
highest in the world, reflecting the airport's burdensome debt service. Still, 
airlines from 39 countries are waiting for permission to land at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The airport authority believes the second-phase construction will sufficiently 
expand capacity, but concedes that the second main runway, at 8,250 feet, will 
be too short for anything but short-haul flights within Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The most vexing problem with Narita -- its formidable distance from the capital 
-- is likely to be improved in early 1991, when the government hopes to 
complete a new rail link connecting the terminal to Tokyo Station in 60 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The original plan for a 30-minute "bullet train" route had to be scrapped, 
however. Landowners along the right-of-way would not sell.

<P>
An Episcopal bishop Saturday ordained the church's first openly homosexual male 
priest in a ceremony marred by only one brief interruption. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop John Spong of Newark quickly brushed off two dissenters before formally 
welcoming J. Robert Williams, leader of the Oasis ministry for homosexual 
Episcopalians, into the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
Following church protocol, Spong opened the ordination at All Saints Church in 
Hoboken by asking if anyone knew "of any impediment or crime" that should 
prevent Williams from becoming a priest. 
</P>
<P>
When two people spoke up, the bishop talked to them and continued the ceremony. 
He said he had heard their arguments and saw no reason to delay the ordination. 
</P>
<P>
Spong said the new priest had proven himself spiritually, emotionally and 
pastorally, which sparked a burst of applause from the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is the Episcopal Church's second openly homosexual priest. A lesbian, 
the Rev. Ellen Barret, was ordained in New York in 1977 by Bishop Paul Moore.

Arctic air gripped much of the nation Saturday and knifed as far south as 
Mexico, driving temperatures to record lows in at least 58 cities in 17 states, 
grounding planes and snarling traffic in areas burdened by howling winds and 
snow as deep as 3 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Blinding windblown snow forced a temporary halt to the aerial search for a 
private plane carrying three people that disappeared Friday in a snowstorm near 
the Catskill Mountains about 30 miles south of Albany, N.Y., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Cold forced a one-day postponement of a candlelight ceremony scheduled for 
Saturday evening at Antietam National Battlefield near Sharpsburg, Md. The wind 
chill was expected to be 25 to 30 degrees below zero. Organizers planned to 
light 23,110 candles, one for each soldier killed, wounded or missing after the 
Civil War's bloodiest single-day battle. 
</P>
<P>
Snow was falling in parts of the West, Northeast, Southwest and Midwest -- 
including many spots hit by the snow a day or two earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The cold air system sent temperatures plummeting below the freezing mark as far 
south as Texas, where the Dec. 16 record was broken or tied in 13 cities. 
</P>
<P>
The mercury hit 9 in Abilene, 12 in Ft. Worth, 17 in Austin and San Antonio and 
33 in Brownsville, on the Mexican border. At 24 degrees, Corpus Christi 
recorded its coldest morning since February, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Subzero readings greeted early risers as far south as North Carolina and 
Arkansas, where 13 cities and towns set or equaled records for the date. 
</P>
<P>
Subzero record temperatures were reported in Michigan, Nebraska, Indiana, Ohio, 
West Virginia, Kansas, Missouri and Iowa. New records above zero were set in 
Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
No records were set in Illinois for the first time in several days, but 
whistling winds dropped the minus-11 recorded in several cities to wind chills 
of nearly 40 below. 
</P>
<P>
Farther south, the wind chill in Kentucky was 10 to 20 below, keeping many 
roads icy. Lows around Tennessee were mostly in the single digits early 
Saturday and were generally about 30 degrees below normal. 
</P>
<P>
Wind chill readings reaching 20 below zero sent Philadelphia's homeless 
scrambling into overcrowded shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Some parts of Upstate New York had their first heavy snow in two years, ranging 
up to 11 inches in the southern Adirondacks about 60 miles north of Albany. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters predicted snowfall of 8 to 12 inches in Vermont, New Hampshire and 
Maine by the time the storm ended. 
</P>
<P>
Civil defense officials reported 30 inches of snow by morning in New Carlisle, 
Ind., about 8 miles west of South Bend, which was the warmest spot in the state 
with a reading of 10 degrees above zero.

At the stroke of 4 on the studio clock, the theme music from "The Mod Squad" is 
played, then a gavel bangs and the barbs start flying. 
</P>
<P>
State officials and administrators are denounced as "greedy, shameless hacks." 
The state's latest tax-hike plan is branded as "illegitimate." Gov. Michael S. 
Dukakis becomes "Pee Wee," Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy "The Lady from the Wax 
Museum" and rotund House Speaker George Keverian "The Democrat from Gino's 
Pizza," while Boston Globe writers are tweaked as "bow-tied bum-kissers." 
</P>
<P>
It is Tuesday afternoon at WRKO Radio, and for the next two hours, nothing and 
nobody in Massachusett's liberal Democratic Establishment is safe from attack 
by the self-styled "governors of the commonwealth" -- acerbic talk-show host 
Jerry Williams, muckraking Boston Herald columnist Howie Carr and fervent 
anti-tax crusader Barbara Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, Carr and Anderson have formed an on-the-air troika that has raised 
political debate in this state to new heights -- or taken it to new depths, 
depending on your view. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters praise them as the voice of the people, defenders of the underdog, 
champions of the average taxpayers. Critics -- particularly those most often on 
the receiving end of their barbs -- denounce them as an example of "trash" 
radio at its worst. "Two hours of hacks, hokum and hyperbole," wrote a Boston 
Globe reporter recently. 
</P>
<P>
What is certain is that the three are no garden-variety radio gabfesters. 
Massachusetts is in the throes of a monumental budget crisis that has forced 
the governor and the Democratic leadership in the Massachusetts Statehouse to 
cover. Last week Standard &amp; Poors made the state's credit rating the lowest 
in the country, citing a poor economy and a "paralyzed budgetary process." 
</P>
<P>
Into the leadership vacuum has stepped this unlikely trio, who by most accounts 
are driving the debate on how the state should deal with its problems. 
</P>
<P>
Their tirades against bloated state payrolls, high taxes, ballooning budget 
deficits, official corruption, cronyism and incompetence in government have 
become the stuff of almost daily political discourse in the Bay State. 
</P>
<P>
"They represent a frustration that we all feel in the commonwealth," said Alan 
Macdonald, executive director of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, an 
association of chief executive officers from the state's major corporations. 
"There's a majority (of Massachusetts residents) that's totally frustrated by 
the state's lack of ability to get spending in line with normal revenue 
growth." 
</P>
<P>
Their clout is often awesome. On several occasions during budget debates last 
summer, for example, Statehouse switchboards were overloaded for hours with 
calls generated by their over-the-air suggestions to voters to express their 
displeasure to their representatives. 
</P>
<P>
The radio triumvirate's opposition also was instrumental in the scuttling last 
month of a $1.2-billion tax package that called for a 40% sales tax hike, a 50% 
increase on capital gains and a near doubling of the 11-cents-a-gallon gasoline 
tax. The plan was looked on by many House leaders as their last best hope to 
combat a state budget deficit that has swollen to more than $825 million. 
</P>
<P>
"They are devastating," said four-term Rep. Eleanor Myerson, a Democrat from 
the fashionable Boston suburb of Brookline. "They get on the radio and scream 
and holler and give out the names and phone numbers of legislators and say: 
'Never vote for them again.' We can tell they're effective. The callers all say 
the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Also effective are their ceaseless assaults -- usually spearheaded by Carr, the 
Herald columnist -- on the "hacks" in state government: people on the public 
payroll who are related by blood or marriage and purportedly gained their 
lucrative jobs only because of their family or political connections. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are in this building," Boston Democratic Rep. Mark Roosevelt told a 
Globe reporter recently, referring to the Statehouse, "you hear more and more 
people talking about getting out. . . . The long-term effect is a nastiness and 
vindictiveness that poisons the body politic." 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis, who has become increasingly embattled since his failed presidential 
campaign last year and as the state's fiscal ills have worsened, has publicly 
alluded to the troika's pervasive influence. Last July, for example, in a 
lengthy speech defending his legacy as the state's longest-serving chief 
executive, he spoke of the "talkmasters and columnists" whom he claimed had 
given politics and public service a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as things were going well," he said, referring to the vaunted economic 
prosperity the state enjoyed during much of this decade, "they were kind of 
gnats." But now, he added: "We've got to take them on." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the three joined together as a radio team, they were each 
individually forces to be reckoned with on the Massachusetts political scene. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 66, the "dean" of talk-show radio hosts in Boston, who 
</P>
<P>
was a passionate on-the-air advocate for civil rights and American withdrawal 
from Vietnam in the '60s and '70s, was widely credited for the repeal three 
years ago of Massachusett's automobile seat-belt law. 
</P>
<P>
Carr, 37, whose column appears thrice weekly in the Herald, a tabloid owned by 
Australian-born press lord Rupert Murdoch, had become the scourge of state 
government with his "hack family of the week" reports -- the ones that now 
often are the source of his on-the-air attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, 46, executive director of the 10,000-member Citizens For Limited 
Taxation, engineered passage in 1980 of a measure known as Proposition 2 1/2 
that, among other things, put stiff caps on increases in property taxes, the 
major source of local government funding. She often is referred to as the 
"Howard Jarvis of Massachusetts," an allusion to the architect of California's 
1970s tax-slashing Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, their voices had become among the most strident in 
opposition to tax increases and other Democratic-proposed measures to combat 
the state's mounting deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"This state has been so dominated by Democratic politics for the past 25 years 
that it's somewhat like what was going on in Eastern Europe," said Williams, 
whose afternoon talk show airs Monday through Friday from 2 to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Then in April, Ron Doyle, a columnist for the Middlesex News in Framingham, 
wrote a column in which he described them as "an unlikely tag-team of political 
bomb throwers" who had emerged as "the all-powerful, unholy trinity of state 
politics." He questioned rhetorically who had appointed them as governors. 
</P>
<P>
That was all it took for Williams to call Carr and Anderson and propose that 
the three of them go on the air as the "governors" for two hours a week as part 
of his regular show. 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel like I've created a Frankenstein monster," Doyle recently lamented. 
"They're out of control, and I don't see any end in sight." 
</P>
<P>
After the opening theme is played each Tuesday, Williams bangs a homemade gavel 
that was sent to the group as a gift and calls the session to order. He then 
asks for reports from the other two. 
</P>
<P>
Carr usually announces his "hack family of the week," although in the most 
recent show, his chief topic was a report in his newspaper about the two state 
revenue department employees who had been suspended in connection with an audit 
of his income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Carr, a constant critic of Dukakis, charged that the audit was politically 
motivated. The audit, which was launched earlier this year, has been 
discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who usually does not indulge in the name-calling and high-voltage 
attacks of the other two, usually gives a report on the status of tax 
legislation and government spending. 
</P>
<P>
Then the floor is opened for other business. Mock resolutions often are 
debated. In addition, state officials are frequently "fired" or state agencies 
"abolished." Votes are most always unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
To some Bostonians, the show is nothing more than harmless political satire. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, however, to the Boston Globe, the state's biggest newspaper and 
frequent target of the "governors" -- particularly Williams and Carr. 
</P>
<P>
Last month it published a four-part series titled "Poisoned Politics" that came 
down hard on the talk-show trio, pointing out their inaccuracies and tendency 
to descend into personal attacks. "Cynicism is the Hallmark of 'Governors on 
the Airwaves,' " read one of the headlines over the second of the four 
articles, which was devoted exclusively to a report on Williams, Carr and 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Globe columnist Alan Lupo has referred to Carr as the "last 
surviving member of the Borgia family," while Editorial Page Editor Martin 
Nolan has compared him to Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels. 
</P>
<P>
Globe Editor John R. Driscoll denies that the series was prompted by fears over 
the growing influence of the trio. "The series is just part of a whole lot of 
coverage we've been giving on the atmosphere in Massachusetts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mark Jurkowitz, a media critic for the Boston Phoenix, said in a recent 
article that the Globe's "new aggressiveness" may reflect a deep concern. 
</P>
<P>
"For years -- while Dukakis values held sway and the Globe was the official 
organ of those values -- folks like Williams and Carr were merely small voices 
in the wilderness, with a hard-core but disenfranchised following. Suddenly, 
however, a rushing tide of anti-government anger has lifted their boats and 
carried them into the mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
The triumvirate has perhaps no bigger boosters in Boston than the Republican 
Party, long the invisible crowd in Democratic-dominated Massachusetts. At a 
recent state party conference, GOP officials presented Williams with a 
community service award. 
</P>
<P>
"Republicans are being registered at twice the rate of Democrats," said Ray 
Shamie, state Republican chairman. "All of these things have stirred up people 
to the point where they want to throw the bums out." 
</P>
<P>
How long the "governors" will stay in office on the radio is a question they 
are often asked. With Dukakis off the political stage after next year's 
elections, the focus of much of the public anger they have tapped into will be 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
But Carr is philosophical: "There'll still be lots to talk about. And if we're 
not around, at least we'll be a big part of Boston radio history." 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The new Czechoslovak foreign minister has chosen a 57-year-old woman who has 
become the internationally known voice of the opposition Civic Forum movement 
here to be the nation's next ambassador to the United States, The Times has 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
The new ambassador would be Rita Klimova, who has served as a Civic Forum 
strategist but who is more widely known as the simultaneous translator for the 
organization's press conferences. The job has made her the voice of the 
movement for millions of television watchers and radio listeners around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier plans to formally submit the nomination to the 
full Cabinet on Thursday, where it is expected to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Klimova was born in Czechoslovakia but spent seven years in the United States, 
from 1939 to 1946, after her parents -- Communist Party members -- fled the 
country to escape the Nazis. She speaks fluent English with a New York accent. 
</P>
<P>
A former professional translator, Klimova keeps a set of headphones at home and 
has been known, on occasion, to simultaneously translate movies for her 
children and grandchildren.

ARCHBISHOP SELECTED FOR VATICAN-KREMLIN TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: THE POPE GETS 'A CLOSE COLLABORATOR' TO FOLLOW UP ON HIS MEETING WITH 
GORBACHEV.

<TEXT>
<P>
Delicate maneuvering is under way along the hushed corridors of Vatican 
diplomacy in the aftermath of the momentous meeting here between Pope John Paul 
II and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, reshuffles in the Curia that administers the Roman Catholic Church 
attract only insiders' attention, but the reassignment of a senior diplomat 
last week proved an exception: The Vatican made plain that he would play a key 
role in an intricate process of repairing historic enmities between 
Christianity and communism. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Edward Cassidy, a 65-year-old Australian who had been No. 2 in the 
Vatican's secretariat of state, was named president of the Council for 
Promotion of Christian Unity. As such, Cassidy will represent the Vatican at 
negotiations with the Russian Orthodox Church over renewed rights for 
long-suppressed Catholics in the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
The rights of several million Oriental-rite Catholics in the Ukraine who have 
preserved their faith and maintained their allegiance to Rome despite four 
decades of official prohibition is fundamental to Vatican-Kremlin 
rapprochement. 
</P>
<P>
In a historic encounter of Slavs earlier this month, Gorbachev promised the 
Pope that there would be full restoration of religious freedom throughout the 
Soviet Union. Already Catholic hierarchies are being re-established and 
churches reopened in the Baltic republics and Byelorussia. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also invited John Paul to visit the Soviet Union, an invitation the 
Pope dearly sought. But he stopped short of accepting outright. The two leaders 
also agreed to restore official links between Moscow and the Holy See, broken 
after the victory of the October Revolution in 1917. Vatican and Soviet 
diplomats are discussing at what level the new ties should be established. 
Initially they will probably stop short of full diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
As far as the Soviet government is concerned, religious freedom will be assured 
with passage by the Supreme Soviet early in 1990 of a new law guaranteeing 
freedom of conscience. In the Vatican's view, the real test will come in the 
religiously contentious Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the new legislation, Soviet officials in the Ukraine are allowing 
so-called Uniate Catholics to officially register for the first time since 
their church was abolished by Josef Stalin in 1946. Suppression brought arrest 
for all seven bishops and many of the Ukraine's 2,211 priests. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of World War II, there were 4.5 million Uniates in the Ukraine. 
Their church had 2,156 parishes, 195 houses for religious orders, three 
seminaries and a theological academy, and ran 9,900 schools. 
</P>
<P>
Stalin forcibly folded the Uniates into the government-approved and 
government-obedient Russian Orthodox Church, which broke with Rome in the 11th 
Century. By Vatican estimate, most of the 3 million to 4 million Catholics in 
the Ukraine today attend Orthodox services. A minority are "catacomb" Catholics 
who, along with about 500 priests and their bishops -- some of them unknown to 
Rome -- have practiced their faith clandestinely. 
</P>
<P>
Enactment of the pending legislation will effectively transfer the Ukraine 
question from a Vatican-Kremlin issue to a Vatican-Orthodox question. That is 
where Cassidy comes in as successor to retiring 80-year-old Dutch Cardinal 
Johannes Willebrands. In announcing Cassidy's promotion, the Vatican said 
bluntly that the Pope wanted "a close collaborator" in the Christian unity 
post. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy, a diplomat, must negotiate new rules of the game with an Orthodox 
church that has much to lose with Uniate freedom: a part of its flock, some of 
its priests and a large number of pre-Stalinist Catholic churches. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing a turning tide, Uniates were vigorously lobbying for the return of 
about 80 churches in the western Ukraine even as Gorbachev headed for the 
Vatican. A Vatican-Orthodox meeting scheduled for earlier this month was 
canceled after protesting Uniates began a vigil for the return of a church in 
the Ukrainian city of Lvov. An Orthodox spokesman denounced the vigil as an 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
An Orthodox patriarch accompanying the official Soviet party on its visit to 
Italy bypassed Gorbachev's stop at the Vatican, warning that his church would 
not negotiate the transfer of property "at the muzzle of a gun." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy assumes his new post with his eyes open. He told an interviewer before 
his appointment was announced: "The Orthodox Church has expressed its hopes for 
a peaceful development, that there would not be violence and confrontation or 
aggressive attitudes. I think we are all anxious that that should be the case. 
We don't want this to develop into a religious struggle but rather as sister 
churches working out their problems in dialogue and Christian brotherhood." 
</P>
<P>
What the Vatican seeks in the Ukraine and elsewhere in Gorbachev's changing 
Soviet Union is the ability to name bishops, to have them establish their sees 
in free communication with Rome and to oversee congregations that worship in 
their own churches. If that happens, Vatican sources say, John Paul will 
quickly accept Gorbachev's invitation to visit, perhaps as early as 1992.

BULGARIANS WANT TO HONOR VICTIMS OF STALINIST ERA PURGES

<TEXT>
<P>
Several thousand protesters Saturday demanded an official funeral service for 
the victims of Stalinist era purges, including a Communist Party chief who was 
hanged after a show trial 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The demand from members of the pro-democracy movement came during a rally here 
commemorating the former party leader, Traicho Kostov, who was convicted of 
spying and stirring up hostility against the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified speaker at the rally accused Vasil Kolarov, who was premier at 
the time, of conspiring to arrange Kostov's execution on Nov. 16, 1949, and of 
sending hundreds of people to camps in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Others said Kostov was killed because he resisted Soviet orders on trade. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd chanted "We want the names of the killers!" expressing outrage over a 
Stalinist terror campaign in Bulgaria in the 1940s and early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Around the time of the Kostov trial, 1,080 people, including party and military 
officials, were prosecuted, the official news agency BTA said Friday. No 
official publication has ever said how many people died in the purges. 
</P>
<P>
The rally came amid swift political developments in Bulgaria, where hard-line 
Communist Party leaders have been ousted in the face of large pro-democracy 
demonstrations. In one concession, officials have condemned the 1968 Warsaw 
Pact invasion of neighboring Czechoslovakia.

BIG TEN INVITES PENN ST.; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: ILLINOIS PRESIDENT SAYS CONFERENCE EXTENDS AN OFFER, AND NITTANY 
LIONS AGREE IN PRINCIPAL TO JOIN.

<P>
Penn State has accepted an offer to abandon its independent status in football 
and join the Big Ten Conference, a high-ranking conference official said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A news conference probably will be held in Chicago some time this week to 
announce that the Big Ten will be expanded to include Penn State, said Stanley 
D. Ikenberry, University of Illinois president. 
</P>
<P>
Ikenberry is chairman of the Council of 10, the Big Ten's association of 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
"We have reached an agreement in principle that Penn State will join the Big 
Ten," Ikenberry said. "We think that if Penn State were incorporated in the 
conference, it would be a natural and happy extension of the conference." 
</P>
<P>
But Bryce Jordan, Penn State president, would not say Saturday whether Penn 
State will make the move. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not in a position ethically to make a positive response," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State has similar academic and athletic interests as current Big Ten 
institutions, Ikenberry said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
He said Penn State has been negotiating actively to join the conference during 
the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
As the 11th school in the conference, Penn State would join Wisconsin, 
Michigan, Illinois, Northwestern, Indiana, Minnesota, Iowa, Ohio State, 
Michigan State and Purdue. The conference probably would keep the name Big Ten, 
however, Ikenberry said. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State belongs to the Atlantic 10 Conference for basketball and other 
sports, but has always been an independent in football. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post, meanwhile, said only a number of competitive, financial 
and contractual considerations remained before the move was made. That could 
delay Penn State's entry into the conference until the mid-1990s, the Post 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the deal had been made, Minnesota Athletic Director Rick Bay told the 
Post: "That's the way it sounds to me." 
</P>
<P>
However, it appears the Big Ten presidents moved ahead without consulting their 
athletic directors about the move. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed there wasn't any dialogue with the athletic directors prior 
to them (the presidents) getting to this point," Bay said. "We need to be 
involved at some point in these discussions, but I don't know when or if that 
will occur." 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State Athletic Director Jim Jones was also concerned about the move. "I'm 
scheduled for the next 15 years in football," he told the Post. "Does that mean 
I have to pick out an opponent every year to drop? Are we going to play a 
round-robin (conference season)? . . . There are a lot of things to be 
determined before I'm ready to say whether this is a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to issue an invitation to Penn State apparently was made in 
Chicago last Sunday, the first day of the Council of 10's two-day semiannual 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State football Coach Joe Paterno said Friday: "The schools in the Big Ten 
are similar institutions to ours academically. It would be a great thing for 
the prestige of this institution to be identified with those people. 
</P>
<P>
"Athletically, it would be a plus in just about every area." 
</P>
<P>
Penn State has rejected the idea of joining a proposed conference that has been 
under discussion since June. Meetings have been held on the possibility of 
forming an eastern conference that could include such schools as Syracuse, 
Pittsburgh, Boston College, Temple, Rutgers, West Virginia, Florida State, 
Miami, South Carolina and Virginia Tech. But such a conference would probably 
not include all sports, which Penn State wants. 
</P>
<P>
Paterno, speaking during a news conference to discuss Penn State's Dec. 29 
Holiday Bowl game against Brigham Young at San Diego, said he understood Jordan 
would make an announcement next week. 
</P>
<P>
Paterno said joining the conference might be too tempting to miss, with his 
scheduled retirement coming in three years at age 65. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you get into a new challenge it kind of gets the blood going," he 
said.

NETS THREATEN, BUT MAGIC TAKES CONTROL FOR LAKERS 
</P>

<P>
By force of will, not to mention a lot of twisting drives to the basket, Magic 
Johnson made sure the Lakers did not succumb to either inertia or the New 
Jersey Nets here Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
One night after an emotional victory at Boston, the Lakers were plodding along 
with a comfortable lead over one of the NBA's dregs when, without warning, the 
Nets rallied. 
</P>
<P>
A seemingly insurmountable 15-point second-half lead had been reduced to five 
points with 7 minutes 45 seconds to play. Johnson then intervened, and a 99-92 
victory was secured. 
</P>
<P>
During a 5:29 span of the fourth quarter, Johnson scored 12 points -- all but 
one basket coming on twisting drives through the lane -- to spark an 18-6 Laker 
run. By the time Johnson was replaced by Steve Bucknall with 2:03 to play, the 
Lakers had a 99-82 lead and their fourth consecutive road victory after 
beginning the trip with two losses. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I'm at my best, at that time of the game," said Johnson, who had 
28 points. "When it got close, I wanted it and tried to create. So we called 
the same play about four or five times in a row." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers made their intentions clear in the fourth quarter -- they put 
Johnson in the low post as a small forward and let him improvise -- and the 
Nets seemed incapable of stopping him. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's final assault began 21 seconds after Purvis Short's fourth 
consecutive jump shot reduced the Laker lead to 81-76. 
</P>
<P>
With 7:24 to play, Johnson sank a jump shot from the wing. 
</P>
<P>
With 6:34 left, Johnson beat the 24-second clock with a drive through the lane. 
Once airborne, he launched a one-handed scoop shot from five feet that swished. 
</P>
<P>
With 5:52 to play, Johnson blew past Net rookie Mookie Blaylock for a short 
punch shot, drawing a foul. He made the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
With 4:02 left, after James Worthy and Larry Drew had scored on earlier 
possessions, Johnson struck again. This time, he took the lead on a fast break 
and scored a layup, again drawing a foul. He made the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
And, with 3:11 to play, Johnson received a pass from Drew on the left baseline. 
He spun quickly and glided in for a basket. 
</P>
<P>
The Laker run finally ended about a minute later when Michael Cooper made a 
layup off a pass from Drew. They led, 99-82. 
</P>
<P>
Although New Jersey (6-15) outscored the Laker reserves, 10-0, in the final two 
minutes, the Lakers (18-5) had made their point -- that Johnson, in certain 
situations, can win games almost single-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had been dominant before the fourth quarter, scoring 16 points, but his 
final effort was necessary. Worthy, the Lakers' leading scorer, felt the 
bruising side effects of his 28-point effort against the Celtics Friday night, 
making five of 13 shots for 12 points as his inside game was neutralized by Sam 
Bowie, Joe Barry Carroll and Roy Hinson. 
</P>
<P>
It was up to Johnson to take control. 
</P>
<P>
He needed some help, of course. Drew, playing point guard in the fourth quarter 
when Johnson moved to forward, had 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
A.C. Green, starting at center for the third consecutive game because of Mychal 
Thompson's injured left heel, had 10 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, starting at small forward, had 13 points and Orlando Woolridge 10. 
</P>
<P>
But all agreed Johnson was the prime mover. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole game was Earvin Johnson," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. "He is 
unbelievable in what he can do. He can post up, drawing double teams, blow by 
them for a layup or kick the ball out for the open man. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the catalyst in every aspect. It was just Earvin taking the initiative. 
I was concerned about a letdown after that big win (over Boston Friday). The 
team looked a little tired and flat. But when Earvin is playing like that, 
we're just about unbeatable." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the Nets were no match. Drew said he simply gave the ball to Johnson 
and waited for good things to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"He's that kind of player," Drew said. "He is just capable of taking a game and 
putting it on the shelf." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy was not surprised that Johnson picked up the scoring load. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nothing new," Worthy said. "He does it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
There has been something different about the Lakers in the last two games -- 
their lineup. Forced to go with a smaller team with the 6-foot-9 Green at 
center and 6-7 Cooper at small forward because of Thompson's injury, the Lakers 
have run more successfully and moved the ball more quickly on the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
Is Riley thinking of keeping that lineup, which features no starter taller than 
6-9, when Thompson returns? Riley wouldn't say, adding: "This lineup gives us 
versatility. I don't know what we'll do. We're pretty good with Mychal in 
there. But what this does is give me a chance to look at our lineup during 
times when we won't have Mychal in the game. We give up a little height with 
this lineup, but we get quickness." 
</P>
<P>
Most important to the Lakers Saturday, however, was that Johnson was in the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Center Mychal Thompson said he will try to play Tuesday at Chicago. Thompson 
has missed three consecutive games because of bursitis in his left heel. It is 
a chronic condition, but Thompson said this is the most severe case he has had. 
"Right now, it feels like I'm carrying a hard-boiled egg in my heel," Thompson 
said. . . . Orlando Woolridge celebrated his 30th birthday Saturday by 
returning to play against his former team for the second time since undergoing 
drug rehabilitation treatment during the 1987-88 season, when he was with the 
Nets. As he was last season, Woolridge was booed by Net fans. This time, 
however, Woolridge handled the situation better. He had 10 points and three 
blocked shots in 16 minutes. "I didn't expect a standing ovation," he said. 
"This year, I was more focused on what I wanted to do. Last year, I didn't know 
what to expect, how they'd respond to me."

KINGS END THEIR TRIP BY GETTING BELL RUNG, 5-2 
</P>

PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Robinson said there would be days like this. 
</P>
<P>
When the veteran defenseman of the Kings warned a week ago that a hockey team 
cannot live on goals alone, he was a lone voice in the locker room, lost in the 
celebration of an easy victory over Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
But when he spoke again Saturday night, he was the dominant voice in the quiet 
gloom after a 5-2 whipping by the Philadelphia Flyers at the Spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
His words of warning about a lack of defense hadn't changed, but now they 
carried more sting after the King defense broke down for the second consecutive 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"We got caught in three-on-one and even four-on-one situations," he said. 
"There are large gaps between our forwards and defensemen. We're playing 
shotgun hockey and it just doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings have been blasting away at the enemy all season with impressive 
results. Their 146 goals lead the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky leads the league with 67 points, Luc Robitaille leads in goals 
with 26 and Bernie Nicholls has 24. 
</P>
<P>
These are the Lakers of the NHL, run and gun. Or skate and gun. 
</P>
<P>
But lately it hasn't been much fun. 
</P>
<P>
In their last two games, both losses, the club has allowed 12 goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings gave up four goals in the third period Friday against the New Jersey 
Devils and four in the second period Saturday against the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
"The easiest thing in the world," Robinson said, "is to go out there and score 
more and more goals. Sometimes you blow the other team out. But it balances 
out. We're playing Russian roulette and now it's catching up to us." 
</P>
<P>
It caught up dramatically with the Kings Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers took the lead at the 3:21 mark of the first period when Mark Howe 
carried the puck behind the net and centered it to Doug Sulliman, who slapped 
it in for his second goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings got even late in the period on a Robitaille shot from the base of 
the left circle, good for his 26th goal. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Kings ran out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
In the space of five minutes of the second period, Philadelphia scored four 
times. 
</P>
<P>
To the cheers of the sellout crowd of 17,423, it happened like this: 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 4:29, Gord Murphy scored his sixth goal on a slap shot from just inside 
the blue line that deflected off a King stick. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 4:45, Mike Bullard got his 15th by sweeping the puck in from the right 
post off a pass from Craig Berube, who had retrieved the rebound off his own 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 8:03, Rick Tocchet got his 17th goal by tipping in a shot from teammate 
Murray Craven. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 9:29, Ilkka Sinisalo scored his 12th goal from just inside the left 
circle off a perfect lead pass from Dave Poulin. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody scores, bang, it's contagious," Bullard said. "Like a snowball, 
it just keeps going." 
</P>
<P>
Probably a good idea not to mention snowball around the Kings. They've seen 
enough over the last week and a half to hold them through the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a tough nine days, featuring six games in six cities, several of them 
buffeted by strong winds, snow and subfreezing temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Four games into the trip, the Kings had two wins and a tie. A reporter was 
asked goalie Kelly Hrudey if this was a successful trip. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's wait until it's over to see," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's over and nobody was asking Hrudey the same question Saturday. Losses 
Friday to New Jersey and Saturday to Philadelphia left the Kings at 2-3-1 for 
the trip, 16-14-3 overall and third in the Smythe Division, only two points 
ahead of Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
After the avalanche of Flyer goals, the game turned ugly. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' Jay Miller and the Flyers' Terry Carkner exchanged blows and were 
slapped with five-minute penalties for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
King defenseman Marty McSorley shoved Tocchet after his goal and got a double 
minor for roughing. McSorley later got 10 minutes for misconduct when he 
squared off against Flyer Jeff Chychrun, who got the same. When McSorley 
started screaming at an official, he was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
So the Kings return to Los Angeles to see if home cooking will make a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, Wayne Gretzky's consecutive-game assist streak ended at 17, tying 
a league record. Saturday, he failed to get a point after doing so in 18 
straight games. He also holds the NHL record in that category with 51 straight, 
a mark set six seasons ago. . . . The Kings return home to close out the 
calender year. They will start with Winnipeg on Tuesday, to be followed by 
Quebec, Vancouver, Calgary and Philadelphia. . . . King right winger Dave 
Taylor has returned to Los Angeles for treatment of a pulled groin muscle. . . 
. Left winger Jay Miller's wife, Paula, gave birth to a daughter, Brooke 
Lindsey, on Thursday in Boston.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE'S TRYING TO GATHER ENOUGH STRENGTH 
</P>

Hank the Bank comes back from the doctor's office. Looks tired. No pep to his 
step. He's been prodded and poked, X-rayed and wired to machines. He's had his 
head examined. Had his heart checked. So far, so good. He feels fine. Feels 
strong as a lion. He's sick and tired, all right -- sick and tired of being 
tested. 
</P>
<P>
"But the doc's got a job to do," Hank Gathers said with a sigh, grabbing a 
chair. "If he clears me to play basketball, and then I go out there and 
collapse again, he'd better be able to show that he ran every test there was on 
me." 
</P>
<P>
College basketball's leading scorer and rebounder for 1988-89, Hank (the Bank) 
Gathers of Loyola Marymount wanders around Gersten Pavilion these days, waiting 
for a clean bill of health. He fainted at the free-throw line during the Dec. 9 
game against UC Santa Barbara -- just blacked out and buckled at the knees -- 
and hasn't played or practiced since. 
</P>
<P>
This is a huge, huge week coming up for the wizards of Westchester, a week that 
could catapult the 5-1 Lions into the national rankings. They play Tuesday at 
Oregon State, then entertain Oklahoma Saturday -- at 9 p.m., PST. (Thanks, 
ESPN.) For a week such as this, Loyola needs all hands on deck. 
</P>
<P>
And Gathers is eager to go. If he plays against Oklahoma, a spare scoreboard 
should be kept handy, in case the current one blows a fuse. The over-under 
should be between 250 and 300 points for this one, because Oklahoma has already 
scored 173 points in one game this season, Loyola 152 -- both against U.S. 
International, the team that has been to defense what Julio Iglesias has been 
to rap music. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola plays a demanding schedule, unlike some people we could mention. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, heck. Let's mention them. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching Oklahoma play Las Vegas on TV, and on the screen they put up 
the names of some of the teams Oklahoma has been playing," Gathers said. "They 
played one team that I have never heard of in my life. I never heard of a 
couple of them. Whoever's scheduling those teams, he's cheating his own 
players. You can see Oklahoma is a great team. He's cheating them by making 
them play nobodies like that." 
</P>
<P>
It's a tell-it-like-it-is quality such as this that Gathers intends to bring to 
his radio-TV career. This guy is busier than Brent Musburger. SportsChannel 
cable people have him doing his own short pregame interview program -- "I guess 
I'll call it the 'Hank the Bank Show' " -- before every Loyola game they 
televise. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 5's Ed Arnold has been taking Gathers to Clipper games and such, so he 
can take notes on interviewing. And KXLU, the on-campus Loyola station, is 
lining up Gathers and teammate Bo Kimble for a regular gig. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, a 6-foot-7 senior who averaged 32.7 points and 13.7 rebounds a game, 
intends to put as much work into a possible sportscasting career -- post-NBA or 
whenever -- as he did into his basketball career. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Gathers went to Roy Englebrecht's Sportscasters Camp last summer 
with 120 other would-be Vin Scullys and Chick Hearns. He has wanted to work a 
mike ever since, as a kid from the Philadelphia projects, he used to imitate 
Dave Zinkoff, the Spectrum's famed public-address announcer, now deceased. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the pleasure of having Mr. Zinkoff do my high school championship game, 
and when that man announced your name, that's when you knew you'd finally made 
it big," Gathers said. 
</P>
<P>
At sportscasters camp, Gathers went with several fellow trainees to an 
Angels-Seattle Mariners game at Anaheim Stadium, where he discovered that when 
it comes to announcing baseball, he might choose to stick to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"They played my tape at the camp, and everyone was laughing at it, it was so 
funny," Gathers said. 
</P>
<P>
He's learning, though. 
</P>
<P>
"My man at SportsChannel, he calls me One-Take Hank. The only bloopers we had 
weren't my fault," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Honesty is Hank the Bank's policy. He doesn't mince words. "That's why I'll 
make somebody a good analyst someday, don't you think?" 
</P>
<P>
Before then, Gathers could become a popular pro wherever he ends up, provided 
his game is anywhere near as good as it has been on the college level. 
</P>
<P>
Clippers Coach Don Casey, whose team practiced Friday against Loyola, is 
impressed by Gathers' skills. But Casey believes Gathers would be a lot better 
off to land in Denver or San Antonio or Orlando or anyplace that runs a 
wide-open, take-no-prisoners offense, rather than with someone such as the 
Lakers or Detroit or even Minnesota that specializes in a patient, 
lots-of-ball-movement attack. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers is smart enough to realize that not everybody takes his scoring and 
rebound totals as seriously as they might if he played someplace else -- at a 
more prominent school, for instance, or on some team that doesn't shoot five 
seconds after it crosses the center-court stripe. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was in the Big East, no, I probably wouldn't be the leader in the big 
categories," he said. "But it's not like my talent level has been affected by 
being here instead of there. The WCC (West Coast Conference) isn't as reputable 
as the Big East, but there's good basketball being played here. 
</P>
<P>
"And you look and see what my totals were when I play the big teams. See if I 
can't handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Uh, OK. Last season, Gathers lit up Oklahoma for 27 points, Arkansas for 28, 
Pepperdine for 31, DePaul for 32 and Oregon State for 34. He also topped the 40 
mark four times, including a 49-point, 26-rebound spree against Nevada Reno. 
And just think how Hank the Bank would score if he could make free throws -- 
last year, he hit 56%; this year, he's doing even worse. 
</P>
<P>
It was at the line, after laboring for 23 minutes against Santa Barbara, where 
Gathers suddenly fell into a heap. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed that I wasn't breathing well. I was getting short breaths while I 
was running, and I'm probably one of the best runners we've got, if not the 
best. I was kind of tired, unusually tired, when Eric McArthur fouled me and I 
stepped to the line. 
</P>

"I wiped my face off, took a deep breath, and suddenly I felt a little 
light-headed. Felt a little rush coming on. That's when I blacked out. For a 
second of time, I could feel myself falling, real slow. When I was on the 
floor, I was awake. My memory's picture-perfect about everything else, but I 
lost a second or two somewhere on the way down. I remember wanting to get up, 
but a couple of my teammates grabbed me. I wasn't so much frightened as 
confused." 
</P>
<P>
What was wrong? 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't know," Gathers said. "Neither does the doctor. He's tested me 
for everything. I'm glad he's being careful, but we've got to get me back in 
the game."

BRONCOS ROLL ON ROAD FOR HOME-FIELD EDGE

Bobby Humphrey and the Denver Broncos both got what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey rushed for 128 yards in 23 carries Saturday to become the first Denver 
rookie to reach the 1,000-yard mark in a season. He also threw a 17-yard 
touchdown pass to Melvin Bratton as the Broncos locked up the home-field 
advantage in the AFC playoffs by beating the Phoenix Cardinals, 37-0. 
</P>
<P>
"We really wanted to secure that home-field advantage, and we played well in 
all phases," Coach Dan Reeves said after Denver rolled up 204 yards rushing and 
475 in total offense. "Humphrey ran tough, broke some tackles and his TD pass 
to Melvin was a thing of beauty." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey said: "We have been working on that since training camp and we finally 
had a chance to use it. I think it should be put in the offensive game plan 
every week." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey, a rookie from Alabama, won a battle of supplemental draft picks. He 
and Phoenix quarterback Timm Rosenbach were taken in the supplemental draft 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
While Rosenbach struggled against the Broncos in his first NFL start, Humphrey 
reached a milestone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a dream getting 1,000 yards," he said. "It's a great 
accomplishment. Early in the season I thought I'd never reach it. But the line 
blocks better and better every game." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey entered the game 28 yards shy of the 1,000-yard mark but had 88 yards 
in 16 carries by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach completed only two of eight passes for 14 yards before being replaced 
by Gary Hogeboom with 5:36 to play in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos' defense, third in the NFL entering the game, limited Phoenix to 
101 yards of total offense and shut out the Cardinals for the first time since 
a 16-0 loss to Tampa Bay on Nov. 10, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals' offensive output was their lowest since they had 86 yards 
against Pittsburgh on Sept. 26, 1955, when the franchise was based in Chicago. 
It was their worst shutout loss since Philadelphia beat them, 38-0, on Dec. 20, 
1981, at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach, taken as a junior-eligible out of Washington State, is earning $1.8 
million this season in his five-year, $5.3-million contract. "I'm still as 
confident as I ever was," said Rosenbach, who was sacked once and had one pass 
batted down at the line of scrimmage. "Sure, I'm upset. But I'm not going to 
worry about today. There are a lot more days left to come." 
</P>
<P>
There might not be many more for interim coach Hank Kuhlmann, who is 0-4 since 
taking over for Gene Stallings on Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the decision to start Rosenbach and I'm going to live with it. If you 
want to point fingers, go ahead," Kuhlmann said. "I put in Gary later because I 
thought he could give us a lift and get some points on the board. But their 
defense just wore us down and we couldn't get anything going." 
</P>
<P>
The win was the most lopsided ever on the road for the Broncos (11-4), who led, 
20-0, at halftime en route to handing Phoenix (5-10) its fifth consecutive 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals' deepest penetration came late in the third quarter, when they 
got to the Denver 31 before Hogeboom lost a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
John Elway completed 20 of 29 passes for 247 yards and threw for two touchdowns 
-- a 14-yarder to Steve Sewell 5:44 before halftime and a 20-yarder to Clarence 
Kay with 3:40 left in the third quarter.

GIANTS EARN A PLAYOFF BERTH WITH 15-0 VICTORY OVER COWBOYS

<P>
The New York Giants have a simple formula for success. Keep an opponent out of 
the end zone and it will eventually get you to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants did just that Saturday, shutting out the Dallas Cowboys, 15-0, to 
clinch an NFC wild-card berth. The ingredients were three field goals by Bjorn 
Nittmo, 91 yards rushing by Ottis Anderson and a defense that limited Dallas to 
just 108 total yards and posted its third goal-line stand in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
It's the first time since their Super Bowl season of 1986 that the Giants 
(11-4) are in the playoffs. If they beat the Raiders next week and Philadelphia 
loses one of its final two, they will win the NFC East; if not, they will be a 
wild-card team. 
</P>
<P>
"At least they've invited us to the dance," Giant Coach Bill Parcells said. 
"We've done a lot more than anyone expected, but we've got a lot more to do." 
</P>
<P>
With the temperature at 25 degrees and winds gusting to 25 m.p.h., the 
left-footed Nittmo, filling in for the injured Raul Allegre, kicked field goals 
of 33, 22 and 26 yards and Anderson went in from the one for a touchdown on a 
fourth-down play. 
</P>
<P>
So confident were the Giants in their defense that Phil Simms, eight of 17 for 
134 yards in the first half, threw just twice in the second. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants made their third successful goal-line stand from inside the one in 
the past three weeks, stopping the Cowboys early in the fourth quarter on their 
only sustained drive -- 58 yards to the one with New York leading, 15-0. This 
one was achieved with help from replay official Bill Swanson, who reversed a 
touchdown call on a third-down pass from Troy Aikman to Steve Folsom. 
</P>
<P>
On fourth down, Carl Banks threw Paul Palmer for a three-yard loss and the 
Giants then drove the ball out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"The game was over right there," said Aikman, who completed 11 of 22 for 84 
yards. "I don't care how good the Giants are, there's no excuse for not scoring 
from the one when you have five opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Steve DeOssie said: "When they get inside our 10, we know that they 
have their backs against the wall. They have to do something special if they're 
going to score on us. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Gary Reasons said: "It makes them think. Then they have to run trick 
plays, like going wide today. It plays into our hands." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first shutout for the Giants since they beat Washington, 17-0, in 
the 1986 NFC title game and it left the Cowboys at 1-14 and 2-25 in their last 
27 games. The Cowboys, with former coach Tom Landry watching from the private 
box of Giant owner Wellington Mara, will finish with their second worst season 
ever -- they were 0-11-1 as an expansion team in 1960. It was the third time 
the Cowboys have been shut out this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The Giants did what they had to," Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson said. "They 
controlled the football and made the plays when they had to."

BECKER IS WEST GERMANY'S ADVANTAGE;

<P>
Boris Becker led defending champion West Germany to a 2-1 lead in the Davis Cup 
final against Sweden on Saturday, then said he would "pray to God so he will 
give me fresh legs tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Becker and Eric Jelen teamed for a 7-6, 6-4, 3-6, 6-7, 6-4 doubles victory over 
Anders Jarryd and Jan Gunnarsson. Becker, the Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion, 
had beaten Stefan Edberg in three sets in Friday's second singles to even the 
final, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Our chances are pretty good now," Becker said. "But I have to be fresh to 
survive another day. It was a very tough doubles by four players in five sets." 
</P>
<P>
Becker teamed with Jelen to beat Jarryd and Edberg in last year's final on 
indoor clay at Goteborg, Sweden, clinching West Germany's first Davis Cup win. 
He can wrap up the victory in today's first reverse singles. 
</P>
<P>
Becker is due up against Mats Wilander. The West German has a 5-2 career 
won-lost record against Wilander and has beaten the Swede all four times they 
met on carpet. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, winner of three Grand Slam titles in 1988 but coming off his worst 
season this year, beat Carl-Uwe Steeb in five sets in the opening singles 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's final, Becker and Jelen came from two sets down to win the 
doubles. On Saturday, the Swedes almost returned the favor. 
</P>
<P>
"They did everything right except winning the last point," said Swedish captain 
John Anders Sjogren. "The Germans played better in the end. But I'm very 
satisfied. Anders and Jan came from two sets down and almost made it." 
</P>
<P>
Becker was the dominant player in the doubles match, dropping his serve just 
once. And he set up the only service break of the decisive fifth set with a 
diving volley down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Becker then slammed a crunching forehand cross-court off Gunnarsson's smash, 
giving the German team a 4-3 edge. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal in the last set was to hold our serve and hang in there until we got 
a chance to break their serve," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
That service break was the first since the fourth game of the third set, when 
Becker dropped his serve for the only time in the match. 
</P>
<P>
Becker closed out the match by holding his serve at 30 in the last game with a 
second delivery that Jarryd netted. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to calm down in the last game," Becker said. "I expected a couple of 
tough points, but I stayed calm." 
</P>
<P>
Gunnarsson, making his first appearance in a Davis Cup final, was in trouble in 
the third game of the fifth set. But he managed to hold to 2-1 after the Swedes 
had fought off four break points. Gunnarsson ended the game with an ace, a 
service winner and another ace. 
</P>
<P>
Becker and Jelen, who seldom plays doubles outside Davis Cup competition, took 
the first set on a tiebreaker, 8-6, after saving two set points at 4-6. Becker 
clinched it, blasting a return at Gunnarsson's feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Swedes also had a set point before the tie at 6-5. But Gunnarsson 
double-faulted and eventually lost his serve that set up the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
The West Germans took a 2-0 sets lead after breaking Jarryd and Gunnarsson 
midway through the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Becker lost his serve in the third set after Gunnarsson's volley tipped over 
the net and dropped dead. 
</P>
<P>
The Swedes came back to level the match by winning a fourth-set tiebreaker, 
7-4. The West Germans led 4-2, but the Swedes got back after a pair of 
excellent returns by Jarryd and Gunnarsson off Becker's first serve. 
</P>
<P>
It was another disappointing setback for Jarryd, the world's top-ranked doubles 
player. Last Sunday, he lost the Masters doubles final in London with John 
Fitzgerald of Australia, his regular partner. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big match today," Jarryd said. "But we have to play two more matches 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
It was also the second Davis Cup match in a row that Jarryd was beaten in the 
doubles.

NEWSWIRE: ATTORNEY SUES 5 NFL ROOKIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles attorney has filed lawsuits against five NFL rookies in an effort 
to recover about $115,000 he contends he loaned the players while they were in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
The suits are filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court by attorney Ray 
Newman, and name among the players Atlanta Falcon defensive back Deion Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the lawsuits today in a copyrighted 
story. The newspaper said the case has been assigned to Judge Robert Cardenas, 
but a court date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said Los Angeles attorney Robert P. Mandel contacted him on Sanders' 
behalf, seeking documents relating to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders declined comment on any specifics of the case. 
</P>
<P>
The other defendants are Hart Lee Dykes of the New England Patriots, Eric Hill 
of the Phoenix Cardinals, Broderick Thomas of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and 
Derrick Thomas of the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
Newman, who is registered as an agent with the National Football League Players 
Assn., told the newspaper he never had a contract or an agreement to represent 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever they needed money, I would loan them the money," Newman said. "I've 
asked for the money back and they won't even respond. Am I supposed to walk 
away? I didn't do anything wrong. They made debts and they should pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt some of the black kids were getting used," said Newman, who is black. 
"I was going to be different. Instead, they were smarter than I thought. They 
were just playing a con game." 
</P>
<P>
According to Newman's suits, Derrick Thomas ran up a debt of $35,160, followed 
by Sanders with $28,460; Hill with $26,462; Broderick Thomas with $17,067 and 
Dykes with $7,900. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick Thomas acknowledged that he owes Newman $3,000. He said the players 
never conspired to dupe Newman, and were concerned about recruiter Terry Bolar, 
who has solicited players for various agents. 
</P>
<P>
David Berst, assistant executive director of enforcement for the NCAA, said the 
NCAA probably won't pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can find out about it while they're still playing, we declare the 
athlete ineligible," Berst said. "But it's extremely difficult because almost 
always it's a secret between the agent and player."

University of Pittsburgh officials are considering replacing football Coach 
Mike Gottfried with offensive coordinator Paul Hackett, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Press reported that Hackett heads a list of possible 
replacements for Gottfried. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt officials have not confirmed that Gottfried has been fired, but athletic 
department sources told the newspaper and the Associated Press that he was 
dismissed Thursday after refusing to resign. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Athletic Director Ed Bozik has scheduled a meeting Monday 
with assistant coaches to inform them of their futures with the team. All but 
Gottfried are said to have their jobs at least until after the John Hancock 
Bowl on Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Hackett probably will coach the Panthers in the bowl game against Texas 
A&amp;M, the paper said.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: IRISH ARE IN A 1-3 HOLE WITHOUT STANDOUT LAPHONSO ELLIS -- 
THEIR WORST START SINCE 1981.

Without the Phonz, happy days have been few this season for the Notre Dame 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Going into today's game against UCLA (4-0) at the Joyce Athletic and 
Convocation Center, the Fighting Irish are 1-3 and seemingly counting the days 
until the return of their best player, LaPhonso Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-9 forward who was a freshman All-American last season, when he 
averaged 13.5 points and 9.4 rebounds a game and had 24 points and 13 rebounds 
in an 82-79 victory over UCLA at Pauley Pavilion, Ellis is academically 
ineligible for at least a few more days. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, his grade-point average slipped below 2.0, the university-imposed 
minimum for athletes. Ellis, who is eligible by the less-stringent NCAA 
standards, is expected to return to the lineup this week after the university 
registrar accepts his fall grades. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Irish continue to struggle, though they have everybody back from 
a team that was 21-9 and reached the second round of the NCAA tournament before 
losing to Georgetown, 81-74. 
</P>
<P>
After beating San Francisco in their only home game, they lost to Louisville at 
Indianapolis, to Indiana at Bloomington, Ind., and to Marquette at Milwaukee. 
The 80-68 defeat by Marquette ended a 12-game winning streak against the 
Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis' absence has played a major part in their worst start since 1981, Coach 
Digger Phelps said last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the Celtics without Larry Bird last season," he said. "As one of the 
kids said, 'It would be like football without Tony Rice.' Certain guys make the 
chemistry work. LaPhonso is one of those guys." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Ellis helped the Irish gain a 39-20 rebounding edge over the 
Bruins. In an 81-65 win over Vanderbilt in the first round of the NCAA 
tournament, he had 17 points and 18 rebounds in only 25 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand why everyone's concerned and looking at us and saying, 
'What's wrong?' " said Phelps, who believes that the reason should be obvious 
to anybody who has seen Ellis play. "He's an impact player, and impact players 
make a lot of things happen. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a charismatic player and one of the best who will ever play Notre Dame 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, the Irish will make do without him. 
</P>
<P>
And UCLA, seemingly, will take nothing for granted. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Bruins avoided J.R. Reid for all but 10 minutes in two games 
against North Carolina -- he was returning from an injury when the teams met in 
December and was suspended when they met in March -- and still they lost twice, 
absorbing one of their worst losses at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in six games last season against teams that advanced beyond the first 
round of the NCAA tournament, the Bruins were 1-5, beating only Louisville on a 
controversial goaltending call at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
"That was probably as good as we were a year ago," Coach Jim Harrick said. "I 
thought we really got the maximum out of the talent we had. You really couldn't 
have expected much more out of that club. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to take a step further and be a little bit better this year." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Harrick said, this rivalry means more to Notre Dame than it does to 
UCLA. The most famous game in the series, of course, was a 71-70 Irish victory 
that ended UCLA's record 88-game winning streak in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick, though, grumbled for weeks after last season's game. 
</P>
<P>
"Every UCLA coach has been programmed to say (this game isn't that important to 
them)," said Phelps, who has faced seven Bruin coaches in more than 18 seasons 
at Notre Dame. "I think any time they play outside their conference, they make 
a statement like that. But this is like Notre Dame and Southern Cal in 
football. It's a rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not that big a game, then why are we one of their few sellouts in the 
last few years? When they come here, our students know it's UCLA. And when we 
show up at Pauley, the UCLA student section seems to be really wired. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what the coaches say, the fans and student bodies know that this has 
been one of the traditional rivalries in college basketball for the last 20 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Phonz or no Phonz, another scene will be played out today.

WAVES CAN'T KEEP UP WITH KANSAS, 98-73

<P>
For a team that was supposed to cut through Pepperdine like wintry winds 
through wheat fields, second-ranked Kansas had its troubles Saturday night. For 
a while anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But in the last eight minutes, the Jayhawks cut the Waves down to size. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas, with a 17-0 run that turned a close game into a rout, defeated 
Pepperdine, 98-73, before a capacity crowd of 15,800 at Allen Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we slobbed through tonight," Kansas Coach Roy Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Kansas a 10-0 record, the first time since the Wilt 
Chamberlain-led team of 1957-58 that the Jayhawks have won their first 10 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves (2-3) kept the Jayhawks off balance until falling apart near the end. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas never led by more than nine points in the first half. Pepperdine 
outrebounded the Jayhawks, 20-13, before halftime and stayed close with 
three-point shots. The Waves trailed, 46-39, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
But Kansas outrebounded the Waves, 26-13, in the second half and began pulling 
away late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
With 7:42 remaining, Pepperdine's Doug Christie made a three-point play when he 
broke away for a dunk, was fouled and converted a free throw, to cut Kansas' 
lead to 74-69. 
</P>
<P>
But Christie's dunk was the last field goal Pepperdine would score. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said his team began to self-destruct after that. 
</P>
<P>
"We started playing selfishly, began taking poor shots and didn't get a 
defensive rebound in the last five or six minutes," Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were good for 35 minutes, but it's not a high school game. We have to be 
good for 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, we didn't do the basic fundamentals. We self-destructed by 
individually trying to win the game." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Randall, held to six points in the first half, led Kansas with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Pritchard scored 19 points, giving him 1,322 for his career and putting 
in 10th place on the Jayhawk career-scoring list. Pritchard passed Walt Wesley 
(1964-66), who scored 1,315, and is closing in on Chamberlain (1956-58), who is 
ninth at 1,433. 
</P>
<P>
"We really started to get after it in the second half," Pritchard said. "Our 
big guys really did a great job with the ball. Our guards and small forwards 
started to run, and their big guys couldn't keep up. That left several shots 
open for Randall and other people." 
</P>
<P>
Randall said that a "a lot of stuff started to open up in the second half. I 
credit my teammates for that." 
</P>
<P>
"We have real confidence in our outside shooting," he said. "If the guys hit 
outside, then the inside opens up. If we are hitting inside, then that opens up 
the perimeter. It works both ways." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury complimented Pritchard and Randall on their play. "I think Pritchard is 
a super player. I hope there will be a place in the NBA for a guy who plays 
with the heart that he does. You'd really like for a guy like Kevin to get a 
chance to play after college. Randall too." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that Tom Lewis, who played only 26 minutes because of a dislocated 
little finger on his right hand, was affected somewhat by the injury. But he 
quickly added that Lewis' relative ineffectiveness didn't cost Pepperdine the 
game., 
</P>
<P>
Christie led the Waves with 13 points, and Lewis, Shann Ferch and Geoff Lear 
each scored 10. 
</P>
<P>
"We played 32 good minutes," Christie said. "But like the coach said, you've 
got to play 40. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end, everyone tried to do their own thing. I thought we were going to 
(win). Every time we made a mistake, they capitalized on it. We just fell 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
Center Mark Georgeson, who played his first game for the Waves since 
transferring from Arizona more than a year ago, was impressed with Kansas. "It 
shows a lot about a team when they're up 18 to 20 and still scrapping for balls 
and running their offense," he said.

The Bruins have lost four of their last five games to Notre Dame after winning 
seven straight from the Irish. In an 82-79 Irish victory at Pauley Pavilion 
last January, the Bruins were outrebounded, 39-20, and forward Trevor Wilson, a 
two-time Pacific 10 Conference rebounding champion, got only two. "They used 
three guards, so we elected to put Wilson out on one of the wings and we didn't 
get his rebounding," Coach Jim Harrick said. Notre Dame, traditionally among 
the nation's best rebounding teams, got 42 points and 22 rebounds from its 
forwards, LaPhonso Ellis and Keith Robinson, but still had to rally from a 
13-point first-half deficit. UCLA has struggled this season despite its 
unbeaten record -- the Bruins have been outrebounded and they are shooting only 
42.4% -- but today's game offers a more intriguing challenge, forward Don 
MacLean said last week. "We haven't been as high emotionally as we should be," 
he said. "Now that we've got Notre Dame, we're going to get pumped up and ready 
to play some big-time basketball." In the absence of Ellis, who is academically 
ineligible this semester, Robinson has been Notre Dame's leader, averaging 14.3 
points and 6.8 rebounds a game.

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach won its first NCAA Division I women's volleyball 
championship Saturday night at Honolulu with a 15-12, 15-0, 15-6 victory over 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-ranked 49ers (32-5) was led by senior outside hitter Tara Cross, who 
had 20 kills and nine digs. Cross, the co-NCAA player of the year, set a 
tournament record for kills with 125 in five matches. The former mark of 113 
kills was set last season by Hawaii's Teee Williams-Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-0 game was the first shutout in championship final history, and only the 
second ever in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-ranked Nebraska finished 29-4.

Tournament most valuable player Dana Wilkerson scored 21 points as No. 8 Cal 
State Long Beach beat No. 17 Mississippi, 90-67, Saturday night in the Dial 
tournament at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Also in double figures for the 49ers (5-1) were Penny Moore with 18, Trise 
Jackson with 12, Renae Duffie with 11 and Angie Lee with 10. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Martin scored 22 for Mississippi (6-3). Kimsey O'Neal had 17 and 
Charlotte Banks 12. 
</P>
<P>
USC dropped out of the tournament earlier this year, so the three teams played 
round-robin, with each team playing two games. The other team was Northwestern 
Louisiana, which played Thursday and Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach jumped to a 14-2 lead and Mississippi never got closer than nine 
points. The 49ers led, 48-29, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Mississippi Coach Van Chancellor received two technical fouls late in the first 
half. Jackson and Wilkerson made two free throws apiece after the technicals. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee, the defending NCAA champion, begins a series of games against 
Southern California teams today when it meets UCLA at 2 p.m. at Pauley 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have not fared well against the Volunteers, having lost 10 of 11 
games and seven in a row since beating them during the 1980-81 season. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee (5-2) had its 22-game winning streak snapped Dec. 9 by Louisiana 
Tech, 59-58, and was replaced by the Lady Techsters as the nation's top-ranked 
team. Tennessee, ranked No. 2, lost to No. 3 Stanford, 85-71, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (4-1) is coming off an 84-75 victory over Cal State Fullerton in which 
sophomore guard Rehema Stephens, in her first year of eligibility after 
transferring from Colorado, scored a career-high 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee will play at Long Beach Tuesday and at USC Friday.

WYCHE FINED $3,000 FOR KEEPING LOCKER ROOM CLOSED

The NFL fined Cincinnati Bengal Coach Sam Wyche $3,000 for barring reporters 
from the Bengals' dressing room after last week's loss to the Seattle Seahawks, 
Wyche said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The National Football League announced Friday that Wyche had been fined for 
violating league media access policy, but it did not disclose the amount of the 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
Wyche disclosed the amount of the fine while attending a charity fund-raiser. 
He said the NFL should donate his fine to charity. 
</P>
<P>
"The money should go to help somebody else, not just to pad the coffers of the 
NFL," Wyche said. "I really don't know where the money goes, but wherever it 
goes, I'm going to ask that it goes to charity." 
</P>
<P>
League rules prohibit the team from paying Wyche's fine. But Wyche said he 
wouldn't be surprised if some of his players kick in contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The league's media policy states that team locker rooms are to be opened after 
a brief waiting period, usually five to 10 minutes. But after Sunday's 24-17 
loss, Wyche closed the locker room to the media.

WHEN SWING AND A MISS ISN'T APPRECIATED

<P>
The golf season begins when the baseball season ends for many major league 
pitchers, who, not surprisingly, comprise a group of pretty good golfers. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' Orel Hershiser has a six handicap. But then he started playing 
golf when he was 5 at the Lancaster Country Club in Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser's grandfather used to take him to the club and let him play one hole 
before dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had any professional lessons, but my dad and grandfather were good 
golfers," Hershiser said Thursday from Florida. "I still play a lot with my dad 
and I played with my grandfather until he passed away. Monday, all four 
Hershiser men are going to play -- it's a family thing." 
</P>
<P>
The four Hershisers are Orel, his father, also named Orel, and his two brothers 
-- Gordie, 26, who plays in the Dodgers' minor league system, and Judd, 20, who 
plays on the golf team for Alabama Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser is scheduled to play in the Bob Hope Classic Jan. 11-15 and the 
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am Jan. 26-29. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger pitching coach Ron Perranoski said Alejandro Pena, who has a handicap of 
11, and Fernando Valenzuela, with about a 12, are the other golfers on his 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
On the Angel staff, Bert Blyleven is probably the best with a six handicap. The 
others are Kirk McCaskill Bob McClure and Greg Minton. 
</P>
<P>
"But if we get (outfielder) Robin Yount, I'd imagine he would be the best (on 
the team) -- I hear he is a very good golfer," McCaskill said. McCaskill, who 
has been playing golf for 10 years and has about a 10 handicap, plays in 
charity tournaments in the winter and about four other times on his own. He 
thinks that pitching has something to do with his ability to play golf well, 
and conversely, that playing golf in the off-season is good mental practice for 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"From a pitching standpoint, until I'm ready to throw the ball and I'm in the 
right frame of mind, I won't do it as well, and it's the same with a golf 
swing," McCaskill said. "If I don't think I'm going to hit the ball well at 
that particular shot (or) have any negative thoughts, I'll probably duff it. 
Golf is good training and has a similar tempo to pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lewis Yocum, the Angels' team physician and the associate director of 
Centinela Hospital Medical Center's biomechanics laboratory, agrees that both 
golf and pitching have similarities in rhythm and tempo. But he says 
similarities apply to position players as well as to pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"The eye-hand coordination, the reflex action that these people (in baseball) 
have is much better developed than in a lot of other sports," Yocum said. 
"You're going to find that basketball players, the Michael Jordans, for 
example, are very adept at golf, but these are the natural athletes, the people 
that have the ability to pull it together." 
</P>
<P>
Angel outfielder Chili Davis has the most natural golf swing, said Yocum, who 
also called first baseman Wally Joyner and pitcher Mike Witt good golfers. 
</P>
<P>
Perranoski said, however, that a baseball swing can ruin a golf swing, which is 
why pitchers may have the edge over position players on the links. Another 
factor, he said, is that pitchers seemingly have more time to play golf than 
everyday players. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are an everyday player, and there are some excellent golfers who are 
everyday players, they are into a baseball swing, and it's a lot different than 
a golf swing," Perranoski said. " As a hitter, you try to overpower the ball. 
If you are a pitcher, you work on rhythm and throwing the ball and you aren't 
hitting it all the time. A baseball swing could mess up a golf swing." 
</P>
<P>
Hockey and golf: Perranoski said the best golfers in other sports are hockey 
players, explaining: "They are short, stocky, compact, and their swing doesn't 
vary." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Kings' players can support that theory, according to former King 
Jim Fox who retired from hockey two weeks ago and is now director of community 
and player relations for the club. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernie Nicholls is the best golfer on the team, with a handicap of five," Fox 
said. "But all hockey players are probably under a 20 handicap. When they pick 
up a club for the first time they shoot under 100. It's similar in the 
movement, in the eye-hand coordination, contacting a foreign object. Hockey 
players do not have the fear of missing the ball that I think a lot of people 
have when they take up golf because they are used to hitting a moving object. 
It is basically the same thing -- except in golf the hands are together, while 
in hockey the hands are farther apart." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings say Wayne Gretzky plays golf for recreation and doesn't really have a 
handicap, but if he did, Fox said that it would be somewhere between 10 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
Add Hershiser: To Hershiser, golf is seemingly more than just a hobby: "I hope 
to pass (golf) along to my kids, because it is a lifelong sport," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, this is what Hershiser listed as his hobbies, "Rubik's cube, Pac-Man 
and electronic games." 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California golf community lost two prominent members recently with 
the deaths of Ray Goates and Ray Ditmore. 
</P>
<P>
Goates, golf manager for the City of Los Angeles in 1965-83, died Dec. 5 in St. 
George, Utah. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
He was the first and last City golf manager to oversee all 13 courses. The 
position was eliminated after the passage of Prop. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Ditmore, who died Nov. 11 at 87, served as a golf supervisor for the City of 
Los Angeles for 45 years. He was best known for the planting of 2,000 redwood 
trees in Griffith Park in 1933, and the largest redwood grove in the Southland 
can now be seen near the 14th hole of the park's Wilson course. 
</P>
<P>
The first course developed in Griffith Park was the barren, nine-hole Riverside 
course. Part of the Los Angeles Zoo and the Harding course are now on that 
site. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside course was originally built by Gen. John Baldwin during the 
Mexican-American War. In 1847, Baldwin built a mansion with a private golf 
course in Rancho de Los Feliz. The mansion was wrecked and washed away through 
the golf course during a storm in 1884. 
</P>
<P>
In 1900, Baldwin's course was redeveloped by city workers and volunteers and 
named the Riverside. Golfers played on barren land and sand greens until 1923, 
when the Wilson course was opened with grass greens. 
</P>
<P>
The Harding course, a completely new grass layout, was built in 1924. In 1937, 
the Riverside course was renovated and became the Roosevelt course. It was 
moved in 1962 to its present site across from the Greek Theatre. Parts of the 
old Riverside and Roosevelt courses were absorbed by the Harding and Wilson 
courses and the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying for the Ben Hogan Tour, the PGA's new satellite circuit, began last 
week at various regional sites around the country. While some golfers basked in 
the sunshine at Palm Desert's Mission Hills, one of the qualifying courses, 112 
others played in 12-degree weather at the Northshore Country Club in Portland, 
Tex., which borders Corpus Christi. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how one father, whose son was in Portland attempting to qualify, 
described it: "Monday, there was chilling rain, no practice round and high 
winds. Tuesday morning, play was delayed one hour because of frozen greens. 
There were cold, gusty winds and a chill factor in the teens. My son says all 
the golfers were wearing caps, gloves and heavy clothing. My son tried to hit 
(wearing) gloves, but it didn't work. And when he hit with them off, it felt 
like his hands broke in two." 
</P>
<P>
Only two golfers broke par Tuesday -- Hugh Royer of Aiken, S.C., who shot a 
three-under 69, and Tim Fleming of Oklahoma, who had a 71. The top 22 scorers 
from Portland will advance to the final qualifying round along with the leaders 
from the other four regionals. 
</P>
<P>
The Ben Hogan Tour is meant to provide a proving ground for golfers who want to 
play professional golf. There are 30 tournaments scheduled in 1990, each with a 
purse of $100,000. The tour begins Feb. 1-4 in Bakersfield.

Michael Jordan warmed up for his showdown with Magic Johnson by rallying the 
Bulls to a 115-104 victory over the Charlotte Hornets Saturday night at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets, who have lost 10 in a row, led 96-92 with six minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
But Jordan led the Bulls on an 8-0 run. Then, after the Hornets went ahead 
103-102, Jordan scored three points during a 10-0 run that ended the Hornets' 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 33 points, had nine rebounds, seven assists, two blocks and two 
steals to lead the Bulls to their fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls and Lakers will play Tuesday night at Chicago in the first of their 
two regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
It seems certain that Jordan will be ready for this one. When Johnson was voted 
the NBA's most valuable player last season, Jordan wasn't happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I am certain," Jordan said, "that I had an MVP season." 
</P>
<P>
While leading the Bulls to their four victories in a row, Jordan has averaged 
35.3 points, increasing his scoring lead over the New York Knicks' Patrick 
Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
During the four games, Jordan has averaged nearly 59% accuracy from the field 
and eight rebounds and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan likes to play down the individual battle between himself and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"We are progressing as a team," Jordan said. "We are developing a killer 
instinct. It won't be an individual battle between Magic and myself." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls' Craig Hodges made five of six three-point shots to keep the Hornets 
from taking a solid lead. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 99, Milwaukee 96 -- The Heat sneaked up on the Bucks while they were 
still celebrating Friday night's surprise road victory over the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
With Rony Seikaly scoring 22 points, including a three-point play with 1:24 
remaining at Milwaukee, the Heat, winners of only five of their first 22, won 
their second in a row. They beat the Minnesota Timberwolves Friday night at 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks are the first non-expansion team the Heat has beaten in more than a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Douglas made four consecutive free throws in the last 35 seconds to 
preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 104, Detroit 92 -- The Warriors are back. 
</P>
<P>
They followed up Friday night's victory at Portland by beating the NBA champion 
Pistons at Oakland. The Warriors have won four in a row after winning only four 
of their first 18. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, playing without Isiah Thomas, lost their third in a row. Thomas 
returned to Detroit after suffering a concussion during Friday's loss at Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons also lost Bill Laimbeer three minutes into the second half when he 
threw the ball at referee Hue Hollins. He missed, but still was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
New York 118, Seattle 97 -- Every two or three days Patrick Ewing converts 
another team to the idea he is the dominant center in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
As Ewing led the Knicks, the only NBA team still unbeaten at home, to their 
ninth consecutive victory at Madison Square Garden, it was the SuperSonics' 
turn to be convinced. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing, although he missed most of the second quarter because of foul trouble, 
had 30 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
While Ewing was on the bench, the Knicks' second unit outscored Seattle 19-6, 
and it was another romp for the Atlantic Division leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Ewing) has improved considerably over last season," Coach Bernie 
Bickerstaff of the SuperSonics said. "We couldn't do anything with him." 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 125, Orlando 116 -- The Magic gave the Spurs trouble for only a 
half at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson, the favorite to be voted rookie of the year, had 21 points and 
16 rebounds, and Terry Cummings added 29 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We played just good enough to win," Cummings said. "But in this league you 
take what you can get. We fumbled a lot early and they rebounded well. My own 
game is just coming around." 
</P>
<P>
Washington 112, Dallas 108 -- Bernard King had his best night of the season, 
and the Bullets needed it. 
</P>
<P>
King scored 31 points and his two jump shots and two free throws in the last 96 
seconds thwarted the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks, with Adrian Dantley leading the way, built a 65-57 halftime 
lead, but Dantley went sour in the fourth quarter. Rolando Blackman scored the 
Mavericks' last 13 points. DAN HAFNER

THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE THE ROAD FOR CAPITALS

<P>
The Hartford Whalers would rather play in Landover, Md.,these days. The 
Washington Capitals would rather play in Hartford, Conn. Maybe they should 
switch homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals and Whalers have poor records at home and winning records on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
They played Saturday night at Hartford and the Capitals, with Steve Leach and 
Dino Ciccarelli scoring goals less than 2 1/2 minutes apart in the second 
period, prevailed, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers, with the best road record (10-5-0) in the NHL, fell to 6-12-1 at 
the Hartford Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
After falling at home Friday night to the New York Islanders, the Capitals were 
4-7-2 at Capital Centre. This prompted defenseman Rod Langway to declare it was 
time for the Capitals to get out of town. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved the Capitals' record to 13-15-4, meaning they are winners 
on the road (9-8-2). 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather be at home," Coach Bryan Murray of the Capitals said. "But we 
just aren't playing well at home. I have no idea why. Tonight we came out ready 
to play. " 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 3, Boston 1 -- Add the Bruins to the list of good teams in the NHL that 
play better on the road. 
</P>
<P>
With Clint Malarchuk stopping 28 shots and defenseman Phil Housley scoring on a 
breakaway to thwart a rally, the Bruins lost for the fourth consecutive time at 
Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Malarchuk, who had back-to-back shutouts against Boston early in his career, 
nearly had another. But Andy Brinkley scored with 11:39 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 4, New York Rangers 3 -- The Rangers have worse problems 
than the teams that can't win at home. Lately, they can't win anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Pat LaFontaine's second goal of the game at 2:25 of the third period at 
Uniondale, N.Y., was the winner as the surging Islanders knocked the Rangers 
out of first place in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
In their last four games the Rangers are 0-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Islanders' first victory over the Rangers in five games this season. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, Edmonton 3 -- The Blues missed a victory at St. Louis when 
defenseman Paul Cavallini, trying to clear the puck, backhanded it into the 
Blues' net. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Messier, closest Oiler to the puck, was credited with his 20th goal. There 
were less than seven minutes to play when the fluke goal tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 4, Pittsburgh 3 -- The Flames, starting to play like Stanley Cup 
champions, fired 50 shots at goalie Tom Barrasso at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Barrasso, playing only his second game after being sidelined for 21 games 
because of a broken hand, stopped 46 of them. Among the four he didn't stop 
were two by Theoren Fleury in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, Detroit 1 -- Chris Chelios scored a goal and set up the other two 
at Montreal to help the Canadiens end a four-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Skrudland, who scored two goals in the first game of the season for the 
Canadiens but then was sidelined for 21 games because of an ankle injury, 
returned and scored his third goal. 
</P>
<P>
Chelios passed to Mats Naslund with 5:18 left in regulation for the 
tie-breaking goal, then scored himself 22 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 4, Toronto 3 -- Shane Churla scored his second goal of the season 
midway through the last period at Toronto as the North Stars ended an 
eight-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
Churla, better known for his fighting ability than his scoring skills, ended 
Toronto's four-game winning streak. DAN HAFNER

HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
A RUNAWAY FOR OLYMPIC PROSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After being plagued by various ailments during his career, Olympic Prospect is 
feeling good these days. 
</P>
<P>
"He's sounder now than he's ever been," trainer John Sadler said. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Prospect's improved health is evident on the track. Hardly a slouch 
before, the 5-year-old Northern Jove gelding is better than ever right now. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen days after a 10-length victory over a solid allowance field, Olympic 
Prospect turned the $105,200 National Sprint Championship at Hollywood Park on 
Saturday into a one-horse race. 
</P>
<P>
The Grade III event was billed as a match between Olympic Prospect and Sam Who, 
but Olympic Prospect was a clear winner despite a less-than-alert takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
At the finish, the 6-5 second choice had a bit more than a length on the 4-5 
favorite and his 12th victory in 24 lifetime starts. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, he capped a three-winner afternoon for Sadler, who moved into a 
tie with David Hofmans atop the trainer standings, and provided Alex Solis with 
his fifth stakes victory of the 24-day-old meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We think he's at his best," Sadler said after Olympic Prospect's 1:08 4/5 
journey, which included :21 3/5, :43 3/5 and :55 4/5 fractions. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a lightly-raced horse who's kind of in the middle of his campaign rather 
than at the end of a long year. He's doing really well, and I just wish he had 
performed a little better on the East Coast (in the Breeders' Cup where he 
finished fifth, then was placed fourth on Sam Who's disqualification). 
</P>
<P>
"Being inside of Sam Who didn't bother me, but I was concerned when he stumbled 
at the start and then had to run head and head with Ron Bon for about a quarter 
of a mile. When he shook him loose, I knew we'd be in pretty good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Being sounder, Olympic Prospect is also more willing to change leads. Reluctant 
to do it in the past, he has come through in each of his last two starts. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the difference this year," Solis said. "He used to stay on his left 
lead from the three-eighths pole to the wire. Now, he switches, and he's able 
to find another gear. 
</P>
<P>
"He was anxious and moving when the gates opened and he stumbled a little bit. 
He's a fast horse and was able to get up with that other one right away, then 
he finished well. John's done a great job with this horse." 
</P>
<P>
Having ridden Sam Who all year, Laffit Pincay decided to remain with the 
Lypheor gelding Saturday, even though he was aboard for Olympic Prospect's 1:08 
2/5 allowance win on Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Still, at the top of the stretch in the Sprint Championship, he thought he had 
made the right choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going to get the other horse," he said. "But Olympic Prospect 
didn't come back to me. My horse ran his race and he finished well. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give the winner credit. He didn't break that good, and when (Ron 
Bon) went with him, I thought he'd stop, but he just kept running." 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Prospect could return in two weeks for the six-furlong Palos Verdes at 
Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
"He's nominated, but (racing secretary) Tom Robbins will decide that for us," 
Sadler said. "It'll depend on the weights." 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Prospect's victory followed wins by Royal Eagle and first-time starter 
Devine Force and left Sadler batting .300 for the meeting. His nine victories 
have come from 30 starters. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got plenty of horses," he said in regards to a possible run at the local 
training title. "I'm going to have to look at a condition book pretty seriously 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Heartlight No. One's second foal is already a step ahead of her first. 
</P>
<P>
Several months after his highly touted half-brother, Alyone, bombed in two 
starts at Santa Anita, Spotlight No. One won at first asking for trainer Gary 
Jones and owners Burt and Carol Bacharach in the sixth race Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old son of Cox's Ridge did a lot of things wrong in his debut, but 
still managed to beat heavily favored Indian Wind a neck in 1:16 2/5 for the 6 
1/2 furlongs, a distance that didn't figure to be his best. 
</P>
<P>
Besides racing greenly, Spotlight No. One got loose and ran off briefly in the 
post parade with Chris McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
"It scared the hell out of us when he got loose, the way things have been going 
for us," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was awfully impressive, but he still doesn't know what he's 
doing. He looks like a 3-year-old and he thinks he's something special." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron said the colt, the 3-1 second choice, galloped out strongly, and he'll 
likely try two turns in his next start. "We'll give him three weeks to a 
month," Jones said. "We want to be careful with him." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was especially gratifying for Burt Bacharach in light of what 
happened to another of Heartlight No. One's foals. 
</P>
<P>
"This colt's half-sister by Lyphard died on the farm," he said. "She would have 
been a yearling. This win takes some of the sting out of that loss." 
</P>
<P>
Tanker Port, who continued Hofmans' hot streak with a win in Friday's feature, 
may return in the Native Diver Handicap Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
One of 11 nominees to the 1 1/8-mile event, Tanker Port is now unbeaten in four 
appearances on the main track after running seven furlongs in 1:21 2/5 Friday 
while defeating Perceive Arrogance by almost three lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"He came out of the race well," Hofmans said. "We're not certain if he'll run. 
If the field comes up short, there's more of a chance of him going. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse has changed so much since Del Mar. Maybe he's maturing now. He 
loves this track and he likes Santa Anita." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ray Seeley, who spent eight years on the California Horse Racing Board, has 
retired. He will be replaced by an appointee by the governor. . . . Hollywood 
Park linemaker Russ Hudak has established Grand Canyon the solid 6-5 favorite 
for today's $1 million Hollywood Futurity. The Ron McAnally entry of Silver 
Ending and Single Dawn is next at 4-1, then comes Dominant Dancer and 
Individualist I (5-1), Farma Way (6-1), Phantom X. (15-1), Talented Pirate 
(20-1) and Elikos (30-1).

NORTH HOLLYWOOD TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
GRANT SLOWS JONES, WINS NORTH HOLLYWOOD TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Grant High played Scrooge with North Hollywood's Dana Jones on Saturday night 
as it claimed the championship of the North Hollywood tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Give Jones a good shot? Bah, humbug! 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers, in a stop-Jones-at-all-cost effort, shackled the Huskies' 
celebrated 6-foot-6 senior center, holding him to a strangely insignificant 
game-high 15 points en route to a 54-43 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' point total was deceiving. He did not score until he made a free throw 
with 3:52 to play in the second quarter. Moreover, while Jones was five of 
seven from the field, he made just five of 11 free throws and missed the front 
end of three one-and-one situations. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the Lancers (7-0) were more than willing to keep sending Jones to the 
line. Whenever the ball met his hands, so too did a forearm -- usually attached 
to center Brunell Mori or guard Jo Jo Halberstadt. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just trying to stop him," said Mori, who fouled out with four points 
and two minutes to play. "He's a great player. Their whole game is based on 
him. By stopping him, we stopped their whole team." 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller, whose Huskies (9-1) entered the game ranked 
No. 1 in The Times' Valley poll ahead of No. 2 Grant, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"There were two keys to their win," he said. "They stopped Jones and we 
couldn't hit from the outside. I don't know what our free-throw shooting was -- 
I'd have to look at the score book -- but I think we missed the front end of 
six one-and-ones. 
</P>
<P>
"The best team won tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Grant forward Rene Delahoya, an unlikely tournament most valuable player at 
6-foot-2, 140 pounds, proved to be the game's most effective player. 
</P>
<P>
Delahoya, who tied forward Setro Terzian with a team-high total of 13 points, 
controlled Grant's pace on offense, pestered Jones when he put the ball on the 
floor and capped two steals with length-of-the-court drives resulting in 
thunderous slam dunks. 
</P>
<P>
"We got great play out of our seniors," Grant Coach Howard Levine said. "North 
Hollywood is dynamite. We just caught them on an off night." 
</P>
<P>
Grant ran off 10 points in a row to take an 11-6 first-quarter lead. Delahoya 
scored five points and Terzian added four. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, North Hollywood had cut the gap to 21-19. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' first field goal came on a two-handed dunk with 2:15 to play in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Grant built an 11-point lead in the fourth quarter on a pair of free throws by 
Terzian. 
</P>
<P>
Jones scored eight points in the fourth quarter, but Grant successfully 
dribbled time off the clock in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a good job," Jones said. "They just played harder. But we didn't get 
any offensive rebounds." 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 69, El Camino Real 54 -- Guard Mike Basowski scored 19 points to lead 
Reseda to a third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hawkins (14 points) and Marquis Wilborn (12) also scored in double figures 
for the Regents (2-4). 
</P>
<P>
Allen Chenen scored 18 points to lead El Camino Real (2-4) and teammate Bert 
Mitchell scored 10. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 73, Chatsworth 60 -- Junior guard Sagy Koren scored a game-high 
26 points and senior guard Jermoine Brantley added 21 to pace the Highlanders 
(5-5) to the consolation championship. 
</P>
<P>
Koren made six of 11 three-point shots -- including three in both the first and 
fourth quarters -- and Brantley scored 12 points in the second half as Granada 
Hills increased its 34-28 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Porter led Chatsworth (3-2) with 17 points.

DORSEY CREDITS RUNNING GAME, INSPIRATION FOR STUNNING UPSET OF CARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a touching moment that went largely unnoticed Friday night as Dorsey 
High celebrated its stunning 26-15 win over Carson in the L.A. City Section 4-A 
championship game at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro assistant coach Paul Bryan, smiling and misty-eyed, found Dorsey 
co-Coach Paul Knox among the revelers on the field and congratulated him with a 
hug. Few words were spoken. They weren't needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was fitting that they won it after all they've been through this 
season," Bryan said. "They sure deserve something to go their way." 
</P>
<P>
Bryan was at Daniels Field in San Pedro on the night of Oct. 6 when Dorsey's 
season nearly came to an end. Kevin Copeland, Dorsey's outstanding wide 
receiver, collapsed on the sideline in a game against San Pedro and, an hour 
later, was pronounced dead of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, the Dorsey coaches gave their distraught players the option of 
calling off the season. They decided to continue playing and dedicate the rest 
of the season to Copeland. 
</P>
<P>
However, after Friday's upset, Knox admitted that winning the school's first 
4-A title was beyond his expectations after Copeland's death. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the season, I felt we had a good team and had a chance to get to the 
semifinals," he said. "After October, we had to make a lot of changes. We 
couldn't be a passing team anymore. I was a bit leery." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a passing attack featuring Copeland, the Dons turned to a pair of 
running backs -- junior Lamont Warren and senior Larry Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
They were quiet in the first meeting with Carson. The Colts limited Dorsey to 
two yards rushing Nov. 3 in a 29-8 Pacific League win at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The rematch was a different story. With Dorsey attacking the middle of a Carson 
defense weakened by injury and the suspension of All-City cornerback Clayvand 
Thomas, Warren rushed for a game-high 83 yards and one touchdown in 25 carries 
while Edmonds gained 76 yards in 12 carries and put the game away with a 
25-yard scoring run with 2:13 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought if we ran the ball straight at them we could gain yardage," Knox 
said. "Our tailback (Warren) and fullback (Edmonds) just stuck their heads in 
there and did the job." 
</P>
<P>
One player who probably felt like hiding his head was Carson quarterback Armin 
Youngblood. In his worst outing, he completed only seven of 28 passes for 96 
yards and was intercepted four times, once for a touchdown. In the two games 
against Dorsey, he was 23 for 68 with nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
A knee injury prevented Youngblood from practicing until Thursday, and he said 
the layoff might have affected his timing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense kept us in the ball game," he said tearfully. "Basically, I didn't 
have the game that I wanted. I didn't even have an average game. It hurt a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
It was difficult not to feel sorry for Youngblood, who set school passing 
records of 2,402 yards and 30 touchdowns this season and is as personable a 
young man as you'll find. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it was difficult not to feel happy for Dorsey, which staged 
a remarkable comeback from tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I was rooting for Carson," said San Pedro's Bryan, who has several friends on 
the Colt staff. "But it sure didn't bother me to see Dorsey win." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery basketball Coach Doug Mitchell broke his leg in a motorcycle 
accident one week before the season, and Friday night he lost his voice during 
the Knights' 57-49 win over Leuzinger in the championship game of the El 
Segundo Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Aside from that," he says, "I'm fine." 
</P>
<P>
But a case of laryngitis didn't stop Mitchell from singing the praises of 
senior point guard Darrell Daniel, who scored a game-high 24 points against 
Leuzinger and was named Most Valuable Player of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a knack for taking the game over in a critical time," Mitchell said. 
"He really seems to turn it on in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
In leading Bishop Montgomery (5-2) to three tournament wins, Daniel scored 22 
of his 24 points in the second half against Chadwick, 24 of his 29 in the 
second half against El Segundo and 20 after halftime against Leuzinger (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
The Knights also received big efforts from guard Kirk Jones and forward Pete 
Tolliver, who were both named all-tournament. Jones, a junior who was a reserve 
on the junior varsity team last season, has been a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really emerging," Mitchell said. "He plays outstanding defense and he 
handles the ball well. He's a real competitor." 
</P>
<P>
The Palos Verdes girls basketball team proved this week that there is life 
after the Burges. 
</P>
<P>
Playing for the first time in four years without 6-foot-5 twins Heather and 
Heidi Burge, the Sea Kings won four games and defeated Carson, 69-45, Thursday 
to capture the championship of the 16-team Artesia Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thought our team was those two," Coach Wendell Yoshida said. "I 
think our team is out to prove that it wasn't just those two. We lost two great 
players, but we've got nine good players back." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes' roster was hardly left bare by the graduation of the Burges, now 
at the University of Virginia. The Sea Kings return three starters from last 
season's team that reached the Southern Section 4-A semifinals, and all three 
played well in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Lisa Humphries (5-10) scored 24 points in the finals against 
Carson and was named Most Valuable Player, while forward Mary Maloney (6-0) and 
point guard Susan Wilhite were both chosen all-tournament. Humphries hit nine 
three-point shots in the tournament, including four against Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to run a fast-break offense and shoot the three-point shot more 
this year," Yoshida said. "The tempo is a little faster." 
</P>
<P>
The competition will get a little faster for Palos Verdes when it opens the 
prestigious Santa Barbara Tournament of Champions at 7:15 p.m. Monday against 
host Santa Barbara. The Sea Kings lost by three points to Santa Barbara in the 
third-place game last season. 
</P>
<P>
Also entered in the 20-team tournament, featuring teams from Tennessee, Nevada, 
Oregon and across California, are top-seeded Morningside (5-0) and Fremont of 
Oakland, last year's State Division I champion and runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside suffered its only loss last season to Southern of Louisville, Ky., 
in the championship game of the Tournament of Champions on its way to a 32-1 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Seven South Bay boys basketball teams are entered in the L.A. Invitational 
Tournament, which begins Monday at Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
Surprising Narbonne, which is off to a 6-1 start after finishing 3-17 last 
season, heads a local field that includes Carson, Banning, Inglewood, San 
Pedro, Westchester and Hawthorne. There are 18 teams in the tournament, which 
concludes with the championship game at 7:30 Friday at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
First-round pairings involving area teams are listed in today's sports 
calendar.

ANTELOPE VALLEY RECRUITERS TAP NEVADA'S NATURAL RESOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although school officials probably would prefer otherwise, the Antelope Valley 
College basketball team is becoming known as UNAV because of its connections to 
Nevada Las Vegas and the state of Nevada in general. 
</P>
<P>
The Marauders, ranked 15th in California and ninth in Southern California, are 
11-3 under first-year Coach Newton Chelette, who prefers the same up-tempo 
style as Jerry Tarkanian's Runnin' Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Three players on the Marauder roster are from Las Vegas high schools and 
another player is redshirting. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* Chelette, 39, was a Tarkanian assistant in 1987. A former assistant at 
McNeese State and head coach at Division I Southeastern Louisiana, Chelette 
coached at Santa Barbara Community College last season before taking over at 
Antelope Valley this season. 
</P>
<P>
* Freshman guard Dedan Thomas, an all-state player at Taft High who signed a 
letter of intent with UNLV, enrolled at Antelope Valley after he failed to meet 
admission standards under Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
* Sophomore guard Paul Ernst, who transferred from Santa Barbara to Antelope 
Valley this season, attended Bishop Gorman High in Las Vegas -- a two-time 
state champion. 
</P>
<P>
* Freshman forward Paul Mantashigian also attended Bishop Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
* Sophomore forward Stan Wilson attended Valley High in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
* Redshirt guard Bruce Schneider attended Basic High in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Because Antelope Valley draws students primarily from only Palmdale, Antelope 
Valley and Quartz Hill high schools, the college is one of eight in California 
that legally can recruit out of state. 
</P>
<P>
Chelette said that the UNAV label does not bother him. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to take advantage of an area like Las Vegas where there are great 
athletes," Chelette said. "It was just one of those things where I had a chance 
to see some of those kids a year ago. It was a natural." 
</P>
<P>
Making a point: In Cal State Northridge's win over Point Loma on Tuesday, Lady 
Matador guard Joan Weinerth scored 18 points, 16 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Weinerth, a freshman from Buena High in Ventura, was 10 of 10 from the 
free-throw line and had five steals in only her second start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Weinerth came into the game averaging six points. 
</P>
<P>
Going bowling: Football coaches from the Western State Conference took every 
chance to boast about the strength of the 12 teams equally divided among the 
conference's two divisions. 
</P>
<P>
When half of the WSC's teams were invited to postseason bowl games, it only 
heightened sentiment within the conference that it, indeed, was the toughest 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the WSC bullies limped away without a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, the Northern Division champion, dropped a 31-28 decision to Rancho 
Santiago in the Orange County Bowl. Bakersfield, the top team in the Southern 
Division (no geography majors in this conference), lost to Kern County rival 
Taft, 36-31, in the Potato Bowl. In the Hall of Fame Bowl, Ventura lost to 
Palomar, 21-20, and in the Southern California Bowl, L. A. Southwest lost to 
Desert, 17-3. 
</P>
<P>
The only Western State Conferences teams that did not lose were Valley and 
Santa Barbara. They played each other to a 25-25 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Doing swimmingly: The nucleus of squads that won three consecutive NCAA 
Division II women's swimming championships are long gone but the Cal State 
Northridge swim machine keeps cranking out great teams. Tina Schnare, Jude 
Kylander and Stacy Mettam, who combined for more than a dozen individual 
national championships in the past three seasons, have completed their 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
So the names have changed, but the results are still the same. At the 
Northridge Invitational last week, nine Lady Matadors qualified in 17 events 
for the Division II nationals March 7-10 at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on their performance . . . I think our women will have an excellent 
chance of winning their fourth consecutive national title," said Pete Accardy, 
CSUN's coach. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Lisa Dial, junior Michelle Sulak and freshman Mara Morgan all qualified 
in three events. Juniors Toady Kimble and Carol Eisele made the standard in two 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge's men's team had six qualifiers in 10 events. Senior Ted Hollahan, 
junior Jack Pentlarge and sophomores John Kunishima and Joe Brosler each 
qualified in two events. 
</P>
<P>
Off and running: Cal State Northridge freshman Erick McBride made his 800-meter 
debut at an all-comers track and field meet at CSUN last week, and while his 
winning time of 1 minute, 52.6 seconds was fast for December, it was short of 
the 1:50 clocking he sought. 
</P>
<P>
McBride was hampered by two factors. First, the race was run 10 minutes ahead 
of schedule, which prevented him from warming up properly. Secondly, the first 
400 meters was run in an overly ambitious 50 seconds. 
</P>

THE TROUBLE WITH SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: AFTER DECADES OF NEARLY UNRESTRAINED GROWTH, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS 
SUFFERING SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS. JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE ARE AT 
STAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Off a gritty street near downtown Los Angeles, across the Southern Pacific 
railroad tracks, workers toil in squat factories for a reason known to all who 
ever packed their bags and journeyed to Southern California: the wish for a 
better life. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the laborers in this neighborhood of furniture, chemical and 
paint plants may find the wish harder to realize. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see a snowball rolling at us -- absolutely," declares Stephen Wise, 
whose Furniture Profiles factory is in Boyle Heights, the same area where his 
grandparents got their start after leaving Germany and Lithuania in the early 
1900s. 
</P>
<P>
Wise worries that tougher clean air rules may raise his factory's costs so much 
that it won't make sense to keep it here. In fact, finding a way to repair a 
tarnished environment without hurting people such as Wise's Latino work force 
is just one in a series of dilemmas that face Southern California in the coming 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Call it the price of success: jammed freeways, polluted air, out-of-reach home 
prices, masses of poor and unskilled people lured here for opportunities they 
do not have at home. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to running an economy, Southern Californians have done it their 
way, a free-wheeling brand of free enterprise in a climate of weak, splintered 
local government. The result has been fabulous economic growth but increasingly 
severe threats to the quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, Southern California may have to choose between the laissez faire 
style of the past and confronting its growing pains in a more aggressive, 
coordinated manner. 
</P>
<P>
"Under every leaf you turn over, there's a sacrifice somebody's going to have 
to bear in order to solve the problem," said Richard Weinstein, dean of UCLA's 
graduate school of architecture and urban planning. 
</P>
<P>
Unsolved, the problems threaten to cause slower economic progress in a region 
legendary for providing its residents the chance for upward mobility. Among the 
growing pains: 
</P>
<P>
* Image problems, arising from media coverage of Southern California as a place 
of stalled traffic, bad air and violent crime. "I was just trying to recruit a 
guy from Cleveland to come to Southern California," lamented John S. Peterson, 
executive director of the Russell Reynolds executive search firm. "He wouldn't 
talk to me." 
</P>
<P>
* Increasing numbers of residents who lack the ability to read, write, add and 
subtract. The economy continues to spawn new jobs but has little productive use 
for the many who can't perform them. 
</P>
<P>
* Stratospheric real estate prices. In Los Angeles and Orange counties last 
year, only one in five households owned their home. Statewide, home ownership 
droped more in the 1980s during any similar period since the Great Depression, 
according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
* An imbalance between where people live and where they work. The search for 
affordable housing has drawn many to less developed areas, causing excruciating 
commutes. That cuts into time -- and productivity -- on the job. 
</P>
<P>
* Overburdened public schools, transportation and other increasingly strapped 
public services. 
</P>
<P>
"The '90s are going to be a period of adjustment," warns David G. Hensley, a 
UCLA economist. "We feel that the state as a whole -- particularly here 
(Southern California) -- has lost attractiveness relative to other areas." 
</P>
<P>
In the adjustment, Southern California gradually will become something 
different from what it has been. Old-time residents may mourn the loss of a 
life style that once was roomy by Eastern standards but now faces inexorable 
forces of urban crowding. Immigrants may have to scramble harder to get ahead 
than did their older brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
For more of the middle class, the California dream will take the shape of a 
modest house in a desert community that is a 70-mile drive from the nearest 
ocean breeze. 
</P>
<P>
"From a quality-of-life standpoint, Southern California is a great place to 
live if you have a lot of money," said Kelly D. Conway, a Newport Beach native 
who is president of Telcom, a telecommunications firm in Pomona. "But it 
becomes increasingly inconvenient if you're middle or lower class." 
</P>
<P>
The region is hardly in peril. In the 1990s, it will continue to close in on 
New York as the nation's largest economy, propelled by international trade, 
diverse industry and a rich consumer base. Most industries will spawn new jobs 
-- defense is a notable exception -- but at lower rates than in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some foresee robust growth on the horizon, with a helpful push from 
business links to Asia: "I would think the '90s are going to be an enormous 
boom for Los Angeles," said Anthony Pascal, a senior economist at RAND Corp., a 
think tank in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Kaiser Permanente has 3,000 job openings in its health-care system 
-- to name just one employer. For all the mystique of Silicon Valley or 
Boston's Route 128, Southern California remains home to the largest 
concentration of high-tech industry in the world, according to Allen J. Scott, 
a UCLA geography professor. 
</P>
<P>
And technology is just part of the story. In the shadow of downtown Los 
Angeles, a seemingly endless stretch of factories makes everything from 
mattresses to machine parts, guitar cases to gym equipment. Its existence is 
even more remarkable, considering that industrial smokestacks dropped like 
dominoes throughout America in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sun Belt is the heartland of the American economy, and Southern California 
is the capital of the Sun Belt -- far and away," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the region remains a magnet for people. During the 1990s, 
almost 2 million more will live in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San 
Bernardino, Ventura and Imperial counties, pushing the population toward 16 
million, according to the California Department of Finance. Of these, more than 
half a million will be immigrants, largely from Mexico and other Latin American 
nations, the Southern California Assn. of Governments projects. 
</P>
<P>
But will tomorrow's arrivals enjoy the same upward mobility as those of 
yesterday did? 
</P>
<P>
Inside his Guatemalan grocery shop on Pico Boulevard, Oscar Mansilla says it 
won't be easy. A farmer's son, Mansilla moved to Los Angeles from Guatemala 
City to seek his fortune in the 1960s. He got a minimum-wage job assembling 
auto brakes in Irvine, rose through the factory ranks -- and saved his money. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he owns two grocery stores near downtown and a hilltop house in Silver 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to be rich, you can do it," said Mansilla, 51, a polite and 
friendly man, during an interview by a pinball machine. But, as customers in 
the Latino and Korean neighborhood looked over his soups, beans, powders and 
other Central American products, he continued: "It's harder now. There's too 
many people. Too much competition. Too many stores doing the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs aren't the only ones who may have to push harder. To their 
chagrin, employers are finding that growing numbers of employees -- including 
many native-born Americans -- are deficient in basic jobs skills. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser Permanente, for example, finds it harder than ever to get new employees 
with a command of English, mathematics and the ability to think critically. 
"The worst-case scenario for me is that if this were to continue for 15 or 20 
years, the entire entry-level work force would be largely untrainable," said A. 
D. Bolden, a vice president with the health-care firm. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the worst growing pains will be caused by the unabating influx of 
people. It will mean more cars and trucks spewing out exhaust fumes, factories 
emitting particles, overall stress on a fragile environment. As a result, 
Southern Californians will have to attempt a high-wire feat in the 1990s: 
trying to reverse environmental damage without displacing factory workers and 
others struggling at the bottom of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Already, a spirited debate is in the air. In March, air quality officials 
proposed more than 100 restrictions on oil companies, factories using paint and 
solvents, automobiles and other sources of pollution. The measures -- planned 
for the 1990s and after -- would pay off handsomely, officials say: more than 
$9 billion yearly in health benefits alone, once they are in place. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they cite the intangible gain of transforming the Los Angeles 
Basin into a place of breathable air and vivid views. Such a change, goes the 
reasoning, would stimulate the economy by attracting people and businesses that 
currently stay away to avoid the smog. 
</P>
<P>
"Clean air will bring a new gold rush to Southern California," predicts 
Patricia Nemeth, a deputy executive officer with the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is so sure. Depending on how the controls finally take shape, 
some employers may choose to relocate; others may pass on higher costs to their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as a very big question mark in the direction of the Los Angeles 
economy in the next 20 years," said Anthony J. Finizza, chief economist at 
Atlantic Richfield Co., which may face a costly conversion of its equipment to 
handle cleaner-burning motor fuels. 
</P>
<P>
For tens of thousands of the poor, a critical question is how smaller 
manufacturers, especially users of paint and solvents, will respond. Southern 
California's ability to retain its low-tech industrial base has meant jobs for 
people such as John Enriquez, an Arizona native who grew up in Guadalajara, 
Mexico. Over the years, Enriquez, 60, has worked sanding, spraying and applying 
wood filler in furniture factories. 
</P>
<P>
Today he is plant manager at Wise's Furniture Profiles, making $50,000 a year 
and in charge of 68 workers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an industry that permits people to learn a trade," he said in a deep, 
measured tone. "You can learn and you can progress." Cutbacks, he went on, 
"would have a tremendous effect on all of us, including me." 
</P>
<P>
A backlash to the proposals may be starting. After the new proposals came out, 
Eric Morgan Inc., a furniture plant in Vernon, laid off 200 workers. Chairman 
Carl H. Schulman sold his home in Woodland Hills, moved to San Diego County and 
set up shop in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody's going to turn around a decade from now and say, 'What the hell did 
we do?' " said Schulman, maintaining that he previously had invested "hundreds 
of thousands of dollars" in equipment to prevent stains and lacquer from 
polluting the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman offered some employees the chance to stay on. But leaving the area 
seemed impractical to Gilbert Chavez, a forklift driver with a 10th-grade 
education who owns a home in Montebello. "I said no. My wife said no," recalled 
Chavez, 52, who was born near the site of Dodger Stadium. "Why should I sell my 
house and go down there for?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet Chavez, who was making $6.70 an hour, acknowledges the risk of staying put. 
"It's going to be hard for me," he said. "This (job) is all I know. Maybe I'll 
try in the post office to be a janitor or something." 
</P>
<P>
Non-polluting companies face their own problems. More than ever, strains on an 
already jammed freeway system will irritate motorists and eat into time on the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Telcom, for example, considered a move to Irvine in 1987, an area 
far richer in high-tech business services than Ontario, its location at the 
time. But Telcom's work force balked. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have had a tremendous turnover of people who wouldn't make the 
commute," recalled Conway, U.S. president of the French-owned firm. Telcom 
settled on Pomona -- to the relief of its 110 workers. Yet even now, it employs 
a vice president of sales and marketing who lives in Dallas. "He wouldn't want 
to move out here, and one of the main reasons is the cost of housing," Conway 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Southern California's once limitless supply of land has become 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
When Defense Systems Corp. of Torrance needed to buy 11 square miles of 
property for an extraordinary expansion, it searched in Southern California, 
which long had supplied it with an experienced labor force. But it picked a 
site in Nevada, recalled William O'Dell, a vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars -- or millions -- an acre," in 
Southern California, O'Dell pointed out. Defense Systems -- which found its 
giant tract east of Reno for "$2 million to $3 million" -- recently hired 140 
workers there and is continuing to expand. 
</P>
<P>
The quest for affordable space is triggering new growth away from established, 
older communities in Los Angeles and Orange counties and to places thought of 
as the boondocks until quite recently. In the 1990s, more employers will join 
the migration. 
</P>
<P>
But the majority of jobs continue to be generated in Los Angeles and northern 
Orange counties, a troubling imbalance that will make traffic and overall 
crowding even worse in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still having people move here faster than jobs," notes Stephen Albright, 
president of Keep Riverside Ahead, a nonprofit economic development effort. 
</P>
<P>
Others are abandoning the area altogether. Obscured by the huge immigration 
from abroad, a surprising exodus seems to be taking place from within. Since 
the 1970s, the number of Southern Californians moving out to other parts of the 
West has surpassed the number moving in from those areas. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence is sketchy, but those leaving seem to have above-average educations, 
and the trend may be accelerating. "A lot of it is, they're just going home," 
observed James T. Minuto, a program manager with the Southern California Assn. 
of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
It is, perhaps, just a modest trend, but some companies wonder what's going on. 
Minuto got a telephone call recently from a national truck rental firm that 
wondered why so many more people seemed to be renting trucks to leave 
California than were renting trucks to come here. "They were having trouble 
keeping trucks in California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of those who remain, many residents are fighting as never before to preserve a 
less crowded, less stressful life style. After all, much of what distinguished 
Southern California -- available land, lack of congestion, relatively low crime 
-- is fading. Many people moved to the region for those very advantages. 
</P>
<P>
Yet underneath the slow-growth movement, some argue, is an economic contest 
between those who have attained a certain life style and others still 
scrambling up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
"Growth control is an extremely selfish approach," argues Charles R. Adrian, 
professor emeritus of political science at UC Riverside and a California 
historian. "I don't think it will work or should work. I don't think you can 
send people away just because you got here first." 
</P>
<P>
The emerging scuffles between those trying to preserve a standard of living and 
others trying to achieve one are the sorts of policy dilemmas that Southern 
California will face increasingly in the coming years. But unlike the past, 
economic growth may not be enough to pay for the big improvements needed in 
education, transportation and other public services. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California will have to clean up its environment, repair its 
infrastructure and improve its schools on a pay-as-you-go basis," writes Harold 
L. Hodgkinson, a population expert and consultant to Arco. "This is a radical 
idea, as Californians, being younger than the rest of us, have always imagined 
that they could get good roads, libraries and schools without paying taxes. 
They still believe this." 
</P>
<P>
Others question whether the fragmented collection of local governments is up to 
the formidable task of conquering the demons that threaten future economic 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's Weinstein contends that single-interest bureaucrats, such as air quality 
officials, will need to consider the broader social implications of their acts 
more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody's got to say that when jobs are threatened, job training programs are 
at least considered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Few believe that Southern California will lose all its economic vitality. Even 
if the region muddles forward with strapped public services and an overburdened 
infrastructure, it will remain a powerhouse relative to other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Tougher environmental measures, for instance, may spawn new industries for 
pollution-control technology. Land-use restrictions will create opportunities 
for engineers and land planners. Business services should grow with the overall 
economy. Pacific trade should continue to boom and provide a key source of 
growth. Even the defense retrenchment will be offset somewhat by new orders for 
civilian aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
On Pico Boulevard, when customers ask Oscar Mansilla whether they should launch 
a business of their own, the Guatemalan grocer never discourages them. Things 
are getting tougher than they used to be, but people should take a chance, he 
advises with time-tested wisdom, "if you've got courage -- and you work hard."

JAMES FLANIGAN: IF DEBT'S A GOOD IDEA, WHY IS BLOOMIE'S FOR SALE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What does it mean that some of the country's largest retail companies, the 
Allied and Federated department store groups that were acquired in 1986 and 
1988 by Campeau Corp., may have to seek protection from creditors? 
</P>
<P>
It means that financial market assumptions of the past decade, that takeovers 
were healthy and debt was wise, are proving unsound. The assumption was that 
retail stores could always come up with cash to service debt. 
</P>
<P>
But the Campeau stores (Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh, Lazarus, Rich's and many 
others) now say the burden of paying interest on $5 billion of buyout debt may 
force them into Chapter 11 bankruptcy by the end of January. Another assumption 
was that stores could be sold and proceeds used to repay debt. But Campeau is 
having a hard time getting a good price even for Bloomingdale's, one of the 
most famous names in retailing. 
</P>
<P>
Other debt-burdened retailers are staggering. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., which went 
through a leveraged buyout in 1986 and borrowed more last year to acquire 
Bullocks stores in Los Angeles, said last week that losses are running higher 
than expected in a "chaotic" retailing climate. Macy Chairman Edward 
Finkelstein said the company hoped to muddle through by cutting capital 
spending and refraining from opening new stores until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
So what? So trouble for some means opportunity for others. Retailers less 
afflicted by debt may take customers away from the troubled and make gains in 
the stock market, where the focus now is on companies with leading stores in 
big cities. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, the darling of Wall Street in the past year has been Dayton Hudson, 
owner of the leading stores in Minneapolis/St. Paul and Detroit, as well as the 
Mervyn's and Target chains. Dayton Hudson stock is up about 60% for the year -- 
even after nervous fluctuations last week on worries about Christmas sales -- 
and security analysts are high on the company. 
</P>
<P>
Which is curious and instructive because two years ago Dayton Hudson fought off 
a buyout offer from Dart Group of Landover, Md., and its owners, the Haft 
family, by calling on the Minnesota legislature for an anti-takeover law -- 
which was duly passed. 
</P>
<P>
Dayton management said the Hafts' offer failed to reflect the company's 
potential, but financial types howled. "For management to stand in the way of 
people willing to sell is not necessarily looking out for shareholder 
interests," said one analyst back then. 
</P>
<P>
But the analyst was wrong. Dayton Hudson has produced rising earnings in the 
intervening years, boosting the stock price and the return to investors beyond 
what the Hafts offered. And the company retains its potential and its sales 
leadership in Minneapolis and Detroit. Had a buyout succeeded, Dayton Hudson 
might have cut back service and given opportunity to Carson Pirie Scott and 
Jacobson's, the runner-up stores in those markets. 
</P>
<P>
Being first is important. "The dominant store in a market enjoys advantages," 
explains Will Danoff, who manages a mutual fund of retail issues for Fidelity 
Investments. "If you're dominant, Estee Lauder introduces a new cosmetic in 
your store, Donna Karan gives you a one-year exclusive on a new line." That's 
not to mention economies of scale -- advertising expenditure spread over more 
sales dollars. Leading stores often can pay higher commissions to salespeople, 
motivating them to cater more to customers, which brings the customers back 
again. 
</P>
<P>
In retailing, financial formulas don't define leadership -- something like 
stage presence does. "When you go to a town, you know immediately which is The 
Store," says analyst Marcia Raley of Minneapolis' Dain Bosworth brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
So who's dominant? According to figures compiled by Sanford C. Bernstein 
analyst David Poneman, The Broadway leads in Los Angeles and San Diego, Macy's 
leads in the New York area and also in San Francisco and Philadelphia. Marshall 
Field leads in Chicago, Foley's in Houston and Dallas, Nordstrom in Seattle, 
Dillard's in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
But next year some leading positions could change. "Those with debt, even 
Macy's, will lose flexibility," says Danoff. Dillard Department Stores, which 
has a strong balance sheet, could make gains in Texas and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an ill wind will benefit whoever acquires Chicago's Marshall Field, 
which is up for sale because its British owner, BAT Industries, is 
restructuring to escape a takeover by raider James Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Field, which analysts say may be bought by its own managers, is the 
kind of property that financial markets dote on today: a store so well liked 
that it becomes synonymous with its community. Dayton's of Minneapolis is like 
that -- customers went to bat for it two years ago when the Minnesota 
legislature sought voter sentiment. Nordstrom, which is renowned for customer 
service, has attracted a huge investor following in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
So why, then, are some of the biggest retailers in trouble? Simple: In all the 
calculations about cash flow and debt service, those companies never mentioned 
customers. That customers would come to the stores was taken for granted. 
There's a powerful warning for every business in the name Campeau.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1980s, the world wondered if Americans could still make cars, TV sets, 
machine tools and computer memory chips. But nobody doubted that Americans 
could make deals. 
</P>
<P>
This was the golden age of the takeover game, when Yankee ingenuity was so 
ostentatiously on display in the hugely profitable fusing, dismantling and 
reshuffling of corporate assets. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street saw that you could often make more money busting up companies than 
running them whole. Suddenly, mergers were no longer largely a pursuit of 
larger companies swallowing smaller ones to gain the advantages of size. 
</P>
<P>
In the new order, it wasn't only the long-established, well-endowed corporation 
that could play a hand in the takeover game. With high-risk, high-yield junk 
bonds and other innovations, industrial parvenus and lone financial 
entrepreneurs could absorb concerns many times their size. Old rules about 
prudent limits on borrowing gave way as new, free-spending managers, like 
aircraft test pilots, launched venture after venture to test the outer limits 
of indebtedness. 
</P>
<P>
In this decade, it was increasingly acceptable for buyers to chase merger 
partners who didn't want to go along quietly. And at larger and larger 
companies, executives turned their will to acquire toward their own businesses, 
in a game called the leveraged buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Investment bankers, junk bond kingpins and raiders, the new financial 
innovators became popular heroes outsmarting the captains of the old industrial 
order. But as the decade closed, and some of the deal makers' debt-heavy 
corporate creations creaked and buckled, it seemed that sometimes they were 
outsmarting themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the decade's takeover history shows landmark deals that include some 
of the biggest acquisitions, involving tens of thousands of employees and 
multibillions in assets. But among the ground breakers are also smaller, even 
obscure, transactions -- and some deals that were never really expected to take 
place at all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bendix-Martin Marietta, 1982 
</P>
<P>
William M. Agee, an aging MBA Wunderkind, may have set the tone for the 
decade's takeovers when he led his Bendix Corp. in a hostile attack on 
aerospace giant Martin Marietta Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Agee's motives were a puzzle: Were there business reasons for the bid, 
outsiders wondered, or did Agee simply regard the hostile deal as the ultimate 
test of business machismo? Mary Cunningham, Agee's influential adviser and 
wife-to-be, was clearly impressed, but the plot took a dark turn when Martin 
Marietta made a counteroffer for Bendix. This new "Pac-Man defense" raised the 
disagreeable prospect that Bendix and Martin Marietta might end up owning huge 
stakes in each other, with true control unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Allied Corp. ended the standoff by buying Bendix, leaving Martin Marietta 
heavily in debt and Agee jobless. He parachuted to safety with a $4.1-million 
executive severance package, but questions about the new generation of business 
strivers lingered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gibson Greetings, 1982 
</P>
<P>
William E. Simon, the former Treasury secretary, made himself a legend in the 
world of buyouts by turning a cast-off property of de-conglomerating RCA Corp. 
into a money machine. Simon and associates put up $1 million of equity and 
borrowed the balance of $80 million to purchase the greeting card company. They 
then cut costs, reorganized and within three years had sold a half interest to 
the public for an $87-million profit. 
</P>
<P>
The deal suggested how much better businesses sometimes can operate in private 
hands rather than as units of vast and perhaps neglectful conglomerates. It 
also helped ignite a decade-long surge of leveraged buyouts, in which 
managements or outsiders borrow to take control from public shareholders, cut 
costs and often sell off assets to reduce debt. 
</P>
<P>
Five years after Gibson, Simon's group hit another vein of gold by buying the 
Avis car rental company from Beatrice Cos. for $200 million, then reselling it 
less than two years later to Avis employees for a $700-million profit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Metromedia, 1984 
</P>
<P>
John W. Kluge, one of the first to see riches in second-rate TV stations, took 
a long step toward making himself the richest man in America with the 
$1.6-billion leveraged buyout of his Metromedia broadcast, billboard and 
cellular telephone chain. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, at the time the largest LBO, was attacked by Wall Street Cassandras 
as an example of the worst kind of debt gluttony. They seemed to have a point: 
Metromedia's stock price had been slumping, and its business prospects were 
mediocre. A few months after Kluge had bought out the shareholders, the company 
missed a debt payment and was forced to restructure. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, however, buoyed by surging values for TV properties, Kluge made a 
personal fortune of $5.2 billion by selling off assets, including his cellular 
telephone holdings and the seven stations that Rupert Murdoch bought to form 
Fox Broadcasting. Forbes magazine recently listed him as the nation's richest 
man. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mesa Partners-Gulf Oil, 1984 
</P>
<P>
T. Boone Pickens Jr.'s raid on Gulf Oil marked the Texas oilman's greatest 
triumph and proved that even small outfits could raise billions with a new 
invention, the high-yield bond. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by Michael Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert's junk bond virtuoso, Pickens' 
Mesa Partners in a few days lined up commitments to raise $3.6 billion for a 
tender offer. The fight marked the first use of Drexel's "highly confident" 
letters, which the firm sent to clients from then on to pledge that it could 
raise the money for huge bids. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens, who later confessed that he never really wanted to buy Gulf, made a 
profit of $518 million when Chevron bought Gulf for $13.4 billion. And 
managements of even big companies "suddenly realized how vulnerable they were," 
says Alan Bromberg, law professor at Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
The deal didn't work out so well for Chevron: Absorbing Gulf gave it severe 
indigestion, depressing its profitability and perhaps setting the stage for a 
takeover battle with Pennzoil that some analysts feel is about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getty Oil-Texaco-Pennzoil, 1984 
</P>
<P>
Possibly the worst deal of the decade, Texaco's purchase of Getty Oil 
besmirched the reputation of Texaco, the Texas justice system and the merger 
game itself. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco had barely agreed to pay $10.1 billion for control of Getty when it was 
sued by Pennzoil for interfering with Pennzoil's earlier preliminary agreement 
to buy the target. In late 1985, after a misbegotten performance by Texaco's 
legal team, a Texas jury awarded a history-making $10.53 billion in damages to 
Houston-based Pennzoil. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was a shocker. And the grumbling about Texas justice swelled 
further when the opinion wasn't accepted for review by the Texas Supreme Court, 
whose members, it turned out, had received generous campaign contributions from 
Pennzoil's lead attorney, Joe Jamail. Texaco was forced into a bankruptcy 
reorganization and only emerged in 1988 by dint of a radical restructuring and 
Pennzoil's agreement to settle for $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The deal marked the biggest payoff to a single lawyer: Silver-tongued Jamail 
got $345 million. In its vulnerable condition in 1984, Texaco also made 
history's biggest greenmail payment: the $1.2 billion that it paid to the 
billionaire Bass brothers of Texas to buy back their shares. Texaco, the 
third-largest U.S. oil company at the time of the Getty acquisition, faded to 
two-thirds its size during the prolonged crisis, and it is now No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney Co., 1984 
</P>
<P>
The takeover war at Disney showed that even companies that are part of every 
American's childhood came come under the raider's fire -- and that, sometimes, 
it's for the best. 
</P>
<P>
After years of stagnation, Disney's management was threatened separately by 
big-league raiders Saul P. Steinberg and Irwin L. Jacobs. The company's 
salvation came in the form of the Bass brothers of Texas, who took the 
uncharacteristic role of a white knight by buying a 24% stake. 
</P>
<P>
The Basses and Walt Disney nephew Roy E. Disney brought in a new management 
team, headed by Chairman Michael D. Eisner. The new blood lifted Disney's 
return on equity to 25% last year from 8% in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The fight also marked the first time that a greenmailer has been forced to pay 
back a portion of his winnings. Last July, Steinberg paid $20.1 million, and 
Disney put up $24.2 million, to settle a suit by aggrieved shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Household International, 1985 
</P>
<P>
This big consumer finance company made takeover history when the Delaware 
Supreme Court, the takeover game's most important arbiter, blessed Household's 
takeover defense, the "poison pill." The device, designed by takeover lawyer 
Martin Lipton, made hostile deals prohibitively expensive by giving 
shareholders special stock rights in the event of a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Fortune 500 chief executives were all taking pills for their takeover 
headaches. Pills are now corporate America's principal anti-takeover defense, 
and some, such as top takeover lawyer Arthur Fleischer Jr., rank the decision 
as the decade's most important development in corporate law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unocal-Mesa Partners II, 1985 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles oil company's successful stand against T. Boone Pickens Jr. 
brought the oilman's first major defeat and also established a key precedent in 
takeover law. 
</P>
<P>
To duck Mesa's $3.5-billion hostile bid for control, Unocal wanted to buy back 
30% of its shares with new securities while excluding one shareholder -- 
Pickens -- from the party. The Delaware courts blessed the move, saying Unocal 
could try to protect shareholders from a proven raider's coercive offer that 
would inevitably shortchange some shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling established the principle that management's defensive moves in 
takeover fights must be proportional to the threat they face. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beatrice Cos., 1986 
</P>
<P>
By far the biggest leveraged buyout at the time, this $6.2-billion transaction 
has been held out as the proof of all sorts of assertions about '80s deal 
making. It first looked flamboyantly risky, then uncannily wise, and now, well, 
just mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the first name in leveraged buyouts, teamed 
up with Beatrice Chief Executive Donald P. Kelly to take the company private, 
cut costs and sell off such assets as Avis, Playtex and Tropicana. In 1987, KKR 
bragged that the deal had yielded a 192% return for investors. But since then, 
the remaining disposable properties haven't sold so easily, and some analysts 
assert that so far the high-risk venture have yielded investors a disappointing 
15%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chicago, Missouri &amp; Western Railroad, 1987 
</P>
<P>
The buyout group that took over this short-line railroad won a place in 
deal-making history by borrowing 1,700 times as much as it invested, and then, 
when the line tumbled into bankruptcy, suing its creditors for lending it too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
The lenders, Citicorp and Heller Financial, had put up the $85-million purchase 
price and also advanced the buyout group its entire $50,000 equity stake. A 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court filing followed the start-up by a year, and the 
suit came last August. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Macmillan-Maxwell Communication, 1988 
</P>
<P>
British media conglomerateur Robert Maxwell's successful $2.6-billion bid for 
the publishing company set a key Delaware court precedent and crystallized 
complaints about less-than-impartial behavior of investment banker advisers in 
takeover fights. 
</P>
<P>
In its ruling, the Delaware Supreme Court castigated one of Wall Street's most 
celebrated investment bankers, Bruce Wasserstein, for allegedly tipping a 
bidding contest away from Maxwell and toward the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts 
management buyout group that retained him. The banker had allegedly slipped 
details of the Maxwell group's bid to the management group, enabling it to 
offer a barely higher winning bid, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the panel said the banker and two Macmillan managers had perpetrated "a 
fraud upon the board." Wasserstein denied the charge, but it wasn't his only 
run-in with the court, which last year impugned his impartiality in the battle 
of Interco and the raiding Rales brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Macmillan's message to the legal world was that once a company's directors have 
decided to sell the concern, they must conduct an impartial auction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campeau-Allied Stores, 1986 
</P>
<P>
Campeau-Federated 
</P>
<P>
Department Stores, 1988 
</P>
<P>
The two huge acquisitions that built Robert Campeau's short-lived retail empire 
marked a high water mark in deal-making derring-do. Their unraveling has 
shocked the credit markets and is still rattling the retail industry. Campeau's 
agony has also contained a lesson for the investment banks that in recent years 
have been acting both as advisers and creditors in the same deals, providing 
so-called bridge loans to close deals that still need long-term financing. 
</P>
<P>
The former Ontario, Canada, building contractor paid $3.6 billion to buy 
Allied, which included the Brooks Bros. and Jordan Marsh chains. To top this 
feat, last year he outbid R. H. Macy in the $6.6-billion acquisition of 
Federated, which was then the largest department store operator in the country 
and owned a glittering prize in the Bloomingdale's chain. 
</P>
<P>
The Allied deal marked one of the first major bridge loans, an $865-million sum 
that was loaned by First Boston. Campeau ended 1988 with a balance sheet 
carrying a sliver of $88 million in equity and debt of $11.4 billion. Last 
September, when he couldn't pay his debts, Campeau ceded control of the empire. 
Now, as the company talks about a possible bankruptcy filing next year, the 
consortium of investment banks led by First Boston is stuck with an outstanding 
$400 million in loans that likely won't be repaid soon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dayton-Hudson, 1987 
</P>
<P>
As a sign of the times, the most significant offer for the big Minneapolis 
retailer was not the possibly legitimate one that came from the Haft family of 
Landover, Md., but the clearly bogus offer that cost speculators millions in 
June, 1987. When an emotionally troubled Cincinnati investment adviser named P. 
David Herrlinger telephoned a financial news service claiming to be offering 
$70 a share for Dayton-Hudson, the shares briefly rocketed from $54 to an 
all-time high of $64. 
</P>
<P>
The stock's ensuing fall cost takeover-stock speculators millions and provided 
the definitive illustration of the way that takeover rumors have moved the 
stock market's vast reservoir of "hot money" in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cain Chemical, 1988 
</P>
<P>
A 77-year-old chemical industry veteran named Gordon M. Cain made himself 
fabulously wealthy, proving that lone entrepreneurs can find value in places 
that corporate long-term planners overlook. As significantly, his saga shows 
deal makers can have a heart, too. 
</P>
<P>
Cain, of Houston, bought seven ethylene plants as big petrochemical firms were 
divesting them for "strategic" reasons. Last year, his LBO firm sold the 
resulting company to Occidental Petroleum for $2.2 billion. Cain personally 
made $120 million profit, but also divided $537 million among 1,350 employees, 
giving windfalls of tens of thousands of dollars to mail-room clerks, 
secretaries and chemical plant workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RJR Nabisco, 1988 
</P>
<P>
The $25.4-billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco was the biggest ever, in any 
number of ways. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts defeated a management-led buyout group 
with a bid that was nearly twice as big as history's No. 2 takeover price. The 
deal activated the biggest golden parachute: the $53.8 million that went to 
Chief Executive Ross Johnson, head of the losing team. Also a record was the 
total of fees paid lawyers, commercial bankers, investment bankers, KKR and 
others. Estimates have ranged from $850 million and $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
And the deal may have marked the biggest failed grab-for-gold by a management 
team. The LBO first proposed by Johnson -- and rejected by RJR's outside 
directors -- could have yielded as much as $2.6 billion for Johnson and 
friends. The size of the buyout deal set off a new round of soul-searching 
about the excesses of the takeover binge. Among other issues, the deal 
highlighted the harm that bondholders can suffer in LBOs. RJR bondholders saw 
the price of their securities fall 20% overnight when the markets learned that 
RJR would soon be carrying a mountain of LBO debt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time Inc.-Warner Communications, 1989 
</P>
<P>
Time Inc.'s battle to elude Paramount Communications and buy Warner 
Communications set a legal precedent that gave corporations another layer of 
armor against hostile bids. 
</P>
<P>
In refusing to set aside Time's $14-billion offer for Warner, the Delaware 
Supreme Court said a management can snub a takeover offer if such a takeover 
would disrupt an established strategic plan. Time had done just that to 
Paramount's $200-a-share, $12.2-billion bid, saying that its own proposed 
acquisition of Warner would create "synergies" that could lift Time Warner Inc. 
shares to as much as $402 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Some Time shareholders and others have called this balderdash and griped that 
Warner shareholders got one of the decade's best deals while Time's holders 
were stuck with one of the worst. One happy stockholder: Warner Chairman Steven 
J. Ross, now Time Warner co-chief executive, whose contract may give him $180 
million over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts have predicted that the ruling will set off a rush among 
corporations to draw up strategic plans to brandish in the event of an attack. 
But some scholars point out that the true scope of the opinion wasn't at all 
clear in the oral ruling delivered last July and won't be until the jurists 
release their written opinion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UAL Corp., 1989 
</P>
<P>
To many, the failure of the $6.8-billion buyout of United Airlines' corporate 
parent embodied everything that was wrong with the decade's deals; its collapse 
brought predictions of the end of an era of highly leveraged acquisitions. When 
the bank lenders pulled the plug on the pilot-management plan last Oct. 13, the 
stock market suffered a mini-collapse, the junk bond market went into a 
tailspin and Wall Street's arbitragers were bloodied with paper losses of $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Among its many problems, the bid was based on unrealistic business projections 
and an unrealistic price of $300 a share -- twice what UAL's stock had traded 
for before the takeover rumors. The plan also gave too much to participants, 
including UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, who would have gotten nearly $100 million 
in various benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Though the deal reflected no glory on any participants, its investment bankers, 
commercial bankers and takeover lawyers nonetheless were consoled afterward 
with $53.7 million in fees. 
</P>
<P>

buyout of retail chain; now Campeau is talking about bankruptcy reorganization.

collapsed in October, sending stock and bond markets into a tailspin.

NORTH POLE, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is, as one would expect, the busiest time of the year at North Pole, where 
the town limits signs read: "Welcome to North Pole. Home of Santa Claus." 
</P>
<P>
Santa and Mrs. Claus are lifting little boys and girls onto their laps all day 
long at Santa Claus House, a North Pole Christmas store. 
</P>
<P>
Acting as Santa's helpers, seventh-, eighth- and ninth-graders at North Pole 
Middle School are answering more than 3,000 letters received here from children 
all over the world. The students answer only those with return addresses. 
</P>
<P>
North Pole Postmaster Mark Lamoureux, 37, and the other postal workers at the 
North Pole Post Office (ZIP code 99705) are busy too, putting North Pole 
cancellations on the more than 80,000 Christmas cards sent here from the Lower 
48 just for the distinctive postmark. 
</P>
<P>
Every night for two weeks before Christmas, a North Pole fire truck, decorated 
with Christmas lights, cruises up and down every street in town, playing 
Christmas music over a loud speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, streets here have names one would expect in a place called North Pole, 
names such as Snowshoe Avenue, Snowman Street, North Star Drive, Santa Claus 
Lane. 
</P>
<P>
There are several North Pole churches, a North Pole Public Library, North Pole 
Police Department, North Pole City Hall and many North Pole businesses, 
including the North Pole Tanning Salon. 
</P>
<P>
And of course, there are lots of Santa Claus businesses here, such as Santa's 
Flower Shop, Santa's Suds (the local self-service laundry) and Santa's Travel 
Agency. There is even the Elf's Den, a local tavern and cafe. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Michael Martin, 40, the 6-foot-9 founder and pastor of the 14-year-old 
St. Nicholas Catholic Church, shrugged his shoulders and allowed: "What else 
would you call a Catholic Church in a town called North Pole?" 
</P>
<P>
Although only 1,640 people live within the city limits of North Pole, which is 
20 miles east of Fairbanks and 130 miles south of the Arctic Circle, the small 
town has eight shopping malls, now jammed with holiday customers. 
</P>
<P>
With Eielson Air Force Base and Ft. Wainwright Army Base nearby, there are 
nearly 15,000 people who live in this area and shop in North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
North Pole is one of the coldest populated areas in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets so cold here many people call a cab when their cars freeze and will 
not start," said Robert Ward, 28, a cab driver for North Pole Taxi Co. 
</P>
<P>
He told how the temperature at one point last year dropped to 70 below with a 
wind chill factor of 110 below. "The antifreeze in our cabs was set for 60 
below. One cab froze while it was being driven down the road. That's what you 
call cold." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that's why the town was named "North Pole." When Bon Davis took up a 
homestead here in 1946, he was the first person to live in what is now North 
Pole. Whenever he went to Fairbanks, people there would kid him about living in 
an ice box. 
</P>
<P>
"They would ask him how things were at the North Pole," recalled Con Miller, 
76, who moved here with his wife, Nellie, and their family in 1950. The name 
North Pole stuck. 
</P>
<P>
It was Miller who led the drive to incorporate North Pole in 1953. Miller 
served as North Pole mayor for 17 years and as North Pole postmaster for almost 
as long. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife own Santa Claus House, a huge Christmas store at North Pole, 
now managed by his son, Mike, 38, who is a member of the Alaska House of 
Representatives, and his daughter Merry Christmas Key. 
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-square-foot store is filled with thousands of Christmas items, 
ornaments, toys and gifts that are sold here year round. 
</P>
<P>
The store sells $2.50 deeds to anybody "who would like to own a piece of North 
Pole." The tiny square-inch plots are located in a square block owned by Miller 
and set aside as a town park. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 40 years, Miller and his wife have been North Pole's official 
Santa and Mrs. Claus. When he was postmaster, Miller received as many as 
300,000 Santa Claus letters each December. But during the past few years, post 
offices throughout the United States have been sending nearly all Santa Claus's 
mail to local organizations that answer the children's letters instead of 
shipping that mail up to North Pole, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
North Pole still gets thousands of letters each year, but nowhere near what it 
received before. 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas Eve, police scanner buffs from miles around listen as North Pole 
Police Sgt. Gerald Ownby, 35, and other members of the force conduct a mythical 
chase of Santa Claus all over town. 
</P>
<P>
"We broadcast a report of a suspicious person shouting 'Ho Ho Ho' and sitting 
in a sled pulled by reindeer seen flying over someone's home after milk and 
cookies were discovered missing," explained Ownby. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally catch the bearded old man wearing a red and white suit and run a 
record check to see if he's wanted, last name Claus, first name Santa. When we 
find out he's doing nothing wrong, we turn him loose. We have a good time over 
the police scanner. It has become a North Pole Christmas Eve tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Carleta (Tootsie) Lewis, 55, is also busy Christmas Eve. She fields calls 
from radio stations from all over the Lower 48 asking if Santa Claus has left 
the North Pole yet.

TRIBOROUGH BRIDGE'S KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUTING: AL COSGROVE, WHO DRIVES A TOW TRUCK, SAVES MANY A STRANDED MOTORIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Cosgrove, who drives a tow truck for the Triborough Bridge, is a very 
understanding person. He says so himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very communicable," he says. "I can deal with any kind of people. It's 
very unique to have that kind of rationality about yourself." And to a lot of 
people whose cars have stalled out in "Roadway One" -- the fast lane of the 
Triborough Bridge -- Cosgrove is a regular knight in shining armor. 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove, who has the job title of assistant bridge maintainer, is strong and 
tough-looking, but he is easy to target as a nice guy. He has a lot of boyish 
facial hair that doesn't quite make it as a beard, and, although he is black, 
he has the almond-shaped eyes of an Asian. 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove grew up in Queens ("in the same neighborhood as Bernard King and his 
brother Albert King" -- both pro basketball players), and now he lives in the 
Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. He has been working for the Triborough 
Bridge and Tunnel Authority, at the main office on Randalls Island, for 13 
years, starting off as a custodian. 
</P>
<P>
"The union and Triborough were kind enough to give me a chance to, you know, 
pick myself up," he said. "They allowed me to go to school. I went to New York 
City Technical College for a period of time, and, you know, accumulated enough 
knowledge to take the test. To get this job it's a pretty hard test you have to 
pass. It's not about driving trucks; it's on the multitrade skills -- 
carpentry, plumbing, being an electrician, a mechanic. I did a lot of studying, 
and I passed. I wanted this job." 
</P>
<P>
The first thing Cosgrove does on his shift, which usually begins at 11 at night 
and ends (unless there's a major accident or the weather is awful, in which 
case Cosgrove is obliged to work overtime) at 7 in the morning, is set up those 
tall orange rubber cones that help funnel the morning rush-hour traffic into 
and out of the toll booths. Now, he zigzagged back and forth, carrying four or 
five cones at a time, setting them about 10 yards apart. On windy winter nights 
this particular part of his job can be torture, he says. Tonight was wet but it 
wasn't all that windy; it was the kind of night during which Cosgrove expects 
to get a few calls. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think with a little rain they can move real fast. But that's 
the most dangerous time on any roadway, 'cause, see, a little bit of rain with 
mostly oil makes it extra slippery out there. When it's a lot of rain, people 
are prepared mentally to slow down. In the wintertime, we get a lot of cars 
that stall out. A nice day we don't see many vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from all the different things that can happen to cars, occasionally 
Cosgrove has to help psychiatric patients from the Manhattan State Hospital on 
Randalls Island who have at times wandered on the bridge and into traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Another tricky, dangerous thing that comes up every now and then is that dogs 
get loose in the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Some nights Cosgrove doesn't get any calls at all. Then he takes care of his 
routine responsibilities, or maybe he chauffeurs Triborough employees on or off 
the bridge, or maybe he'll just drive around to make sure everything is OK. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main scary parts of this job is cars on fire," Cosgrove said. "We 
get a lot of fires -- well, not a lot, but summertime, that's mostly when we 
get fires. In the summertime. Every time I see a major fire, there's a little 
voice in me that says, 'I hope this thing don't blow.' One time I had a fire -- 
this is when I first started. A blazing fire. And I said, "Holy boy, what am I 
going to do with this thing?' But I got there with my hose and sprayed it out. 
And after I did that, the car was really, really hot, but I didn't realize that 
because once you see the fire gone, you don't imagine heat any longer. And when 
I went to hook the car up to tow it, I burned my right hand. I said, 'Holy boy, 
now how am I going to tow this car?' Then I went with my left hand, and I 
burned both hands." Cosgrove sighed and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
After he finished up with the cones, Cosgrove and a sergeant from the toll 
plaza replaced the heavy-duty metal boxes (they call them "vaults") in which 
the fares are collected with empty ones. Then he went to get coffee to go, as 
he usually does, from a Twin Donut in Astoria, and came back to drink it in a 
lounge near the toll plaza that the toll-booth attendants use during their 
breaks. An older man, who had his own special chair situated squarely in front 
of the TV, fiddled with the reception. Cosgrove's walkie-talkie began to 
crackle. Cosgrove said things into it, like "This is the wrecker, come in," and 
"Roger," and "ten-four." Then he turned, and with a trace of urgency in his 
voice he said, "We got a call." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, a van had blown some sort of gasket; the short, surly man to 
whom the van belonged already had help on the way, and in the meantime didn't 
want any assistance from Cosgrove and the Triborough authority. 
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove drove around some more. He took some accident reports to the 25th 
Precinct in Harlem, and to the 40th Precinct in the South Bronx, and then he 
got back on the bridge and parked behind the tolls in the calm slip stream of 
traffic and sat for a while in the cab and finished his coffee, which by now 
was pretty cold. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the low drone of traffic, it was quiet. The rain had stopped. The 
clouds that shrouded Manhattan were fuzzy and luminous. Across the East River, 
the city looked like a painted backdrop in a Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
"So far it's a quiet night," Cosgrove said.

CANDLELIGHT BALL TURNS INTO A FAMILY AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sentiment is everything. Ball Chairwoman Susan Baggott influenced Juniors of 
the Social Service Auxiliary to hold the Candlelight Ball at the Biltmore 
because her husband proposed to her in the hotel's Rendezvous Court. Orchestra 
leader Jerry Bruno got the nod because he played for her wedding reception. 
Colleen Casey, who usually sings with Michael Carney's Orchestra, was honored 
vocalist because she was Susan's Kappa Kappa Gamma sister at USC. Susan's uncle 
Msgr. William Barry, recently honored by the Vatican, gave the invocation. Even 
baby Lorna Baggott, 16 months, was in the arms of her mother during the 
reception line with dad Bob and Juniors president Donna Melone and her husband 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone's joyous. It looks as though the ball, a salute to philanthropist 
Dorothy Leavey, will net more than $125,000 (up from $92,000 last year) for 
Regis House community centers. And because of that Susan's parents, Lorna and 
Jack Barry; Sister Petra Keller, director of the Sisters of Social Service, and 
a committee including Linda Breen, Bridget Loftus, Sally Frawley, Mary McGraw 
and Theresa Dunn are ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
TABLOID: Mix costumed carolers and Dickens' characters Fagin and Mr. Micawber 
with garlands of greenery and bedecked trees. Spread mistletoe and holly on the 
tables. Place the 75-voice USC Concert Choir with Rodney Eichenberger on the 
balconies of the Crystal Room of the Biltmore. 
</P>
<P>
Bring in the organ grinder and the vintage harmonium for 19th-Century parlor 
readings. And position the grand piano on stage with Dudley Moore. That was the 
rare fun of the USC Friends of Music, Dudley Moore and Dickens evening. 
</P>
<P>
Decking the halls for music scholarships were Joyce Sprafka and Friends 
president Lucy Hubbard and School of Music dean Larry Livingston. Honorary 
chairwoman Flora Thornton gathered around Marion and George Scharffenberger and 
Eric Small. More in the audience of 400 were former U. S. Atty. Gen. William 
French Smith and his wife Jean; Lorna Reed; George and Mary Lou Boone and 
Virginia and Simon Ramo. 
</P>
<P>
PREVIEW: Jewels and 18th-Century tables will be under Christmas trees after the 
Junior League of Los Angeles' preview of its 10th annual Antiques Show at the 
Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. President Robin Nenninger and show chairwoman 
Carole Gascou invited the first chairwoman Connie Lynch and her husband Terence 
as well as past chairmen to attend the black-tie affair. And co-chairwomen 
Gwendolyn Hatten Baker and Doris Lebo staged dining midst the antiques -- the 
better to buy. The net is a hefty $100,000 for AIDS and cancer counseling hot 
lines and guides for the handicapped.

MISS MANNERS: WHEN RETICENCE CAN BE GOLDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does anybody except Miss Manners remember a quaint concept called privacy? 
</P>
<P>
Privacy was what kept nice old-fashioned people from telling other people their 
incomes, their physical dysfunctions, their sexual fantasies, and the 
grievances they held against their parents, spouses and children. 
</P>
<P>
Such things, they believed, were personal. This meant that they were discussed 
only with the people to whom they were strictly relevant (give or take a 
confidant or two who promised not to tell and sometimes didn't). They didn't 
even discuss these matters on television. 
</P>
<P>
These people told their doctors that they had been throwing up, but they didn't 
tell anybody in the office cafeteria. They told their tax consultants their 
incomes (they even told that to prospective in-laws, who wouldn't dare expect 
such information nowadays) but they didn't tell the people with whom they had 
gone to school. 
</P>
<P>
They told their spouses that their parents were driving them crazy, and they 
told their parents that their children were driving them crazy, but they didn't 
tell their children that their spouses were driving them crazy. And they didn't 
tell their friends the faults of their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
They may have told their spouses their sexual fantasies, but only if these 
people were in the opposite leading role. They told everyone when they were 
expecting a baby, but only when it was apparent anyway; and they never told 
anybody in the world if this event had not been intended. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did they refrain from announcing all of these things, but they acted 
so insulted if anyone dared to ask, that no one would risk such a question a 
second time. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners finds this kind of reticence dignified, both for the individual 
and for those to whom that person is supposed to be loyal. She also likes the 
side effects -- the blessing of its sparing a great amount of boredom and 
clearing the way for real conversation of general interest. 
</P>
<P>
But she is familiar with the arguments in favor of promiscuous blabbing: 
</P>
<P>
These things are nothing to be ashamed of, so there is no reason not to talk 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
It's friendly. Offering personal information about oneself is a sign of liking 
and trust. 
</P>
<P>
Talking about your troubles makes you feel better. 
</P>
<P>
Telling others about your troubles makes them realize that they are not alone, 
and may encourage them to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
And in fact, Miss Manners does not quarrel with these premises, except the 
first. Shame is not the opposite of publicity. That what you are doing behind 
closed doors is natural and normal is no reason not to close the doors. 
</P>
<P>
But Miss Manners wishes to point out that each of the other arguments carries 
in it reasons to limit strictly the potential audience. 
</P>
<P>
If confiding in people is friendly, then one should do it only to real friends, 
and as there are degrees of friendship, there are degrees of confidence. 
Offering intimate information to those to whom one has not established bonds of 
intimacy is almost bound to result in a cynical evaluation on the part of the 
hearer -- "Why is she telling me this?" "Does he think I give a damn about what 
went wrong with his marriage?" "Oh, no, here comes the recital of symptoms 
again." When confiding is inappropriate, it becomes an imposition. 
</P>
<P>
If discussing your problems makes you feel better -- and dwelling on 
dissatisfactions often has the opposite effect -- shouldn't you consider whom 
it could make feel worse? This includes not only unwilling listeners, but those 
who figure in your stories. Such gossip almost inevitably gets back -- if you 
can't keep your own secrets, it is hardly fair to expect better control from 
those you tell. But even if it doesn't, it is a violation of the dignity and 
privacy of your closest associates. Speaking out about sensitive matters to 
provide solace and information to others who may be in the same situation is a 
more delicate matter. Miss Manners is not the only person to notice how much 
abused that moral purpose is to allow people to pour out their secrets for fun 
and profit. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to her that problems can be discussed in a general way, without 
individuals having to surrender their secrets as examples. The personal story, 
the I've-been-through-it courage can then be offered on a confidential basis to 
those who need it. Otherwise, social pressure develops for anyone with a 
problem to tell his or her story to whoever asks, for whatever reason, 
including idle curiosity uncoupled with sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
When people are cautioned, as they so often seem to be nowadays, to mind their 
own business, the meaning is that they should stay out of other people's. 
Attention might also be paid to minding the interests of their own. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- For 15 years I have had the pleasure of an occasional 
luncheon or dinner with a lovely lady friend. At just about every one of these 
delightful events, she has found it necessary to suggest that I try to taste a 
forkful of something she has on her plate. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she hints that she would like to try something from my plate. Our 
food tastes are quite different, so we rarely order the same things. 
</P>
<P>
All her manners are especially good, with the exception of this food-tasting 
penchant. I consider a person's plate of food to be a very personal and private 
domain. My repeated suggestions that she discontinue her -- in my opinion -- 
ill-mannered table behavior prompted her to suggest that I write for your 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Plates can only be shared by consenting adults, and it seems 
to Miss Manners that you have not consented. Therefore, the lady is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But since she is also lovely and otherwise well-mannered, Miss Manners suggests 
that you ask the waiter to put a taste from your plate on a small plate for 
her, before the food is brought to the table. If she persists with her 
offerings after you decline, suggest that she put them on your bread plate, and 
then neglect to taste them.

Andras Szilagyi heads the psychiatric department at Tetenyi Hospital in 
Budapest. He is also a member of the opposition group Hungarian Democratic 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"Every night I get down on my knees and I pray that Gorbachev will stay alive 
six more months, one more year, so that we can push these reforms through so 
there is no turning back." 
</P>
<P>
He also has misgivings about the commitment of his compatriots: 
</P>
<P>
"Hungarians have had a life without any political ideas, and now they're not 
interested in politics, they don't want to speak, they're just interested in 
consumer ideas and their standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a collective depression. Hungary has lost two world wars, two-thirds of 
its population. We live in a political system we don't like, with economic 
standards that go down step by step. 
</P>
<P>
"The real changes will come when the average man learns to think in political 
terms and not Frigidaires."

Sigrid -- she declined to give her last name -- a coach from Bernau, says of 
East Germany: "If I weren't a single mother, I'd be out of here and in the West

THE ROAD TO REFORM BEGINS IN VIENNA;

TWO YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS BRING THE FIRST CRACKS IN THE WALLS OF THE EAST BLOC.

<P>
In the gray and deliberate world of diplomacy, there are moments when decisions 
are made and agreements are reached whose importance is understood only 
afterward. It can be a painstaking and finely bargained process, the work of 
diplomats, and its significance often lies buried in its very detail. 
</P>
<P>
January 19 was a quiet Sunday morning, bitterly cold in Vienna. Outside the 
Austria Center, the flags of 35 nations flapped impressively in the wind. It 
was a day of ceremony, yet curiously low key. 
</P>
<P>
Andre Erdos, 46, who headed the Hungarian delegation to the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), had been in Vienna since the 
negotiations opened in December, 1986. And, as a career diplomat of ambassador 
rank, he was too much of a professional to be overly impressed by the formality 
of closing ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
But as he moved through the lobby exchanging pleasantries with his colleagues, 
he was not without a private sense of triumph at the historic proportions of 
the documents about to be signed. 
</P>
<P>
Erdos and his government had reason to be pleased: The Vienna negotiations had 
taken the course they had hoped. The 26 months of delicate and difficult talks 
were a follow-up to the landmark 1975 Helsinki accords, most famous for their 
basic declaration on human rights. They advanced the noble generalities set out 
at Helsinki and committed governments to specific guarantees of human rights: 
Freedom to travel, freedom of religion, the rights of minorities and prisoners. 
The Vienna document included a number of measures designed to prevent 
governments from delaying or denying a citizen's rights to travel abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreements of the CSCE have no legal force," Erdos said. "But their moral 
weight is so strong that it amounts almost to legal weight, and they have had a 
direct effect on the behavior of nations. Our instructions from Budapest were 
very liberal. We were to make our views known, even if they differed from those 
of our allies." 
</P>
<P>
The views were, in many cases, decidedly different. It had been hard going in 
the Wednesday afternoon East Bloc caucuses, where the human rights proposals 
cut most deeply for Hungary's hard-line neighbors. There, the Hungarians and 
the Poles formed a kind of liberal front. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary had a clear national agenda -- it was opening up to the West, most 
urgently in economic matters. It wanted friends in the West, the firmer the 
better, and it wanted business from the West. Hungary could no longer afford to 
hold on to a domestic legal code that came from another age and ran counter to 
Western norms -- restrictions on travel, tedious visa procedures -- and that 
bogged down the flow of commerce. Budapest wanted an open door, the traffic 
flowing unhindered in both directions. 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans and the Romanians had their own uncomfortable hard-line axis. 
The Czechoslovaks, Erdos said, had "no taste and no smell." They kept their 
mouths shut, stayed to themselves and went with the majority. The East Germans, 
at least, were serious diplomats. They found the proposition on freedom of 
travel hardest to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets had taken a long time to come around, the talks roughly spanning 
the period of time during which Mikhail Gorbachev consolidated his power. As 
the negotiations proceeded, Erdos and others began to note the periodic 
absences of the Soviet ambassador to the talks, presumably to consult with 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was finished. The speeches were read. Erdos put his initials on the 
document. The Romanians, as expected, said they would sign the document but 
would feel free to ignore any of its provisions if they happened to conflict 
with Romania's "national interests." And, as expected, the Romanians were 
roundly condemned. 
</P>
<P>
But the Romanians could not really stain the triumph. The next morning, Erdos 
packed his two years' worth of files, loaded them into his car and set out for 
the three-hour drive to Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
As he crossed the border into Hungary, waiting for the immigration guard to 
look at his diplomatic passport, it occurred to him, as it often had before, 
that the fortifications he saw -- a fence and guardhouse separating Austria and 
Hungary -- were silly and senseless now, anachronisms. He expected they would 
come down, sooner rather than later. The agreements he had just put his 
initials to seemed to assure that. 
</P>
<P>
But Erdos gave no thought to the trouble and excitement he and his compatriots, 
and that stretch of border wire, were about to bring down on their neighbors. 
He took back his passport and drove on through the tidy farmland and home to 
his capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The East German official newspaper, Neues Deutschland, reprinted the full text 
of the Vienna document the day it was signed. A week later, an Amnesty 
International report accused East Germany of using vaguely written laws and 
secret trials against persons whose activities the government regarded as 
suspicious. The report said that among penalties imposed on prisoners of 
conscience were restrictions on the freedom to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania's leader, Nicolae Ceausescu, toured three factories in Bucharest and 
praised the workers for their efforts, but he noted that the country still had 
a lot to do before it reached "the highest peaks of progress and civilization."

'COMRADE TEACHER SAYS WE SAW IT ALL ON TV' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marie and Marek, ages 8 and 12, watched the revolution in Czechoslovakia on the 
TV set in their family's apartment in a high-rise on the outskirts of Prague. 
</P>
<P>
"Comrade teacher says we saw it all on TV, so we don't have to talk about it in 
school," said Marie, as she sits on her father's lap. "We were on strike for 
one hour," she added. 
</P>
<P>
"The teacher told us that we wouldn't have to learn Russian any more, and we 
were all happy," added her brother. 
</P>
<P>
Marek remembers watching the demonstrations last month: 
</P>
<P>
"There was a demonstration and it was supposed to end, and the policemen got 
angry and went against them with sticks and shields and helmets and they had 
the helmets on. . . . The students were kneeling in front of them saying, 'We 
have empty hands,' and they beat them up." 
</P>
<P>
Would he go to a demonstration? "Yes . . . that there shouldn't be Communists. 
That there should be freedom here." 
</P>
<P>
In the future, said Marie, "we'll be able to travel more abroad, there will be 
different air to breathe, and there will be good things to buy." 
</P>
<P>
And are people happier now? "That depends," said Marek. "The Russian teacher is 
not."

<P>
'IT'S THE END OF AN AGE' -- AND A NEW START; 
</P>
<P>
SOLIDARITY'S OVERWHELMING VICTORY MOVES THE COUNTRY INTO UNCHARTED TERRITORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days after the vote, virtually everyone in a key political position in 
Poland, on either side of the political divide, knew that the country was 
moving into uncharted territory. 
</P>
<P>
The results of the vote became fully known to insiders by Monday night, June 5, 
although official results were not to be released for another day. On June 6, 
Rakowski met over breakfast with his inner circle, and they had just been hit 
with the full scale of the disaster. The group was weary, and the sense of loss 
hung in the air. One participant, acid-tongued government spokesman Jerzy 
Urban, summarized the news. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just a lost election, gentlemen," he said, "it's the end of an 
age." 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at the situation and came to the conclusion that a government should 
be formed by Solidarity," another participant, Labor Minister Ireneusz Sekula, 
said later. "But this was not a motion that was going to be accepted by the 
party." 
</P>
<P>
They saw the situation as hanging in the balance and extremely dangerous. There 
were fears of a party rebellion -- perhaps even of action by the army or 
police. 
</P>
<P>
At the same moment that Rakowski and his colleagues were conferring, Kiszczak 
was meeting with representatives of Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
"He told us," Solidarity's Geremek recalled, "that the situation from the 
government point of view was very difficult. He asked us if it was our 
intention to take power. Our answer was that we would keep to the round-table 
agreements as they were established." 
</P>
<P>
The part of the accord Geremek referred to was the agreed balance of power in 
Parliament -- the 65%-35% split between the Communists and Solidarity. The 
ignominious defeat of the national list candidates threw the balance out. Now 
both the government and Solidarity were stuck with trying to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
On June 8, the Magdalinka group convened to work out the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"You could feel the tension in the room," one Solidarity leader said. "Kiszczak 
opened the meeting. He said Solidarity had conducted a confrontational 
campaign, had violated the spirit of the round table. He said we should know 
that on that morning, the committee for the defense of the country was sitting 
and that some military units were on alert." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa was ready with an answer. 
</P>
<P>
"General, we have been through all this many times since 1981," Walesa said. 
"It is not our fault the national list lost. It lost because, for the first 
time, the people could make a choice without manipulation. That is why, when I 
had the chance, I marked out your name, not once, but so many times I had holes 
in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa's comment, which brought a laugh from at least the Solidarity side, 
lowered the tension. And Solidarity made it clear it would accept any solution, 
as long as it had a legal basis. It was up to the Communists to find it. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting went from 3 p.m. to 1 a.m. In the end, 33 new candidates were 
simply added to the Communist ballot in the second round of the elections. It 
solved the immediate problem, but psychologically, a corner had been turned. In 
effect, Solidarity had bailed out the party. 
</P>
<P>
As some pointed out, Solidarity paid a price with its supporters, most of whom 
wanted to see the Communists thrown out immediately. The task of the 
leadership, Geremek said, was "to avoid a triumphant tone." It was largely 
successful, but pressure was building from "mid-level" Solidarity activists and 
vociferous rank-and-file followers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Budapest, a solemn crowd estimated at 200,000 paid tribute to Imre Nagy, 
prime minister for 13 tumultuous days during the 1956 Hungarian revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicted in a Communist show trial, hanged and buried face down in an 
unmarked grave in 1958, Nagy and four associates, executed with him, were 
reburied as heroes, on a day the authorities declared a "national day of 
mourning." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than three decades Nagy's name had been taboo in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
 In Prague, in closing remarks to a Central Committee meeting of the 
Czechoslovak Communist Party, Milos Jakes, the party chief, said that pessimism 
and nihilism were creeping into the minds of Czechoslovak Communists for no 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
The next problem to arise was Jaruzelski, who announced that he would not be a 
candidate for president, pointing out -- correctly -- that most of the public 
associated his name with the hated period of martial law and not with the 
reforms he had pushed through the Communist Party. The party immediately passed 
a resolution urging him to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
On July 3, a front-page editorial in the Solidarity newspaper argued that in 
exchange for giving the presidency to the Communists, Solidarity should be 
allowed to choose the prime minister and form the government. Now, in the 
Solidarity camp, the issue was openly debated. 
</P>
<P>
After three weeks, Jaruzelski agreed to stand for the presidency. The 
parliamentary vote on July 19 was a cliffhanger: He won with the absolute 
minimum of votes -- and only because some Solidarity members stayed away or 
actually cast votes for him. The narrowness of the vote was yet another 
important sign. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two weeks later, Jaruzelski nominated Kiszczak as prime minister. But 
by now a full-scale rebellion was under way among the Communists' erstwhile 
allies in the Sejm: the United Peasants and the Democratic parties. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next was one of the most remarkable episodes in the history of 
Polish politics. Views of it differ, according to the perspective of various 
participants, but the accounts match in the essential points. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity's parliamentary leaders had been quietly working the corridors in 
what was looking like a promising effort to pry the United Peasants and the 
Democrats loose from their Communist allies. Their advances were directed at 
Alexander Bentkowski, the floor leader of the United Peasants, and his 
Democratic counterpart. Both were receptive to cutting a deal. Bentkowski, 
especially, saw no future for his party in a continuing partnership with a 
Communist Party that was in obvious decline. 
</P>
<P>
The Parliament's vote on Kiszczak was set for Aug. 2. On the day before, it 
appeared to Bentkowski that an agreement had been reached. A lawyer by 
profession, intense and nervous by nature, his immediate concern was to sell 
the proposition to the 75 other United Peasant Party deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Communists and Solidarity would offer generous rewards to his party, 
but, Bentkowski said, "Poland needed a political shock" -- a clear change in 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
"There were cameras in the hallway of the Sejm, outside the room where we were 
meeting," he recalled. "And a reporter asked me if the Peasants were going to 
vote for Kiszczak. We had not made a decision, but I decided we must go ahead, 
so I said that at least 60 Peasant Party deputies and perhaps as many as 12 
Communists would vote against Kiszczak." 
</P>
<P>
The news shot through political circles. Mieczyslaw Rakowski, newly installed 
as Communist Party leader, raced to the Sejm from a hospital bed and read the 
riot act to a joint meeting of the coalition. He told them, Bentkowski said, 
that their defection would be the cause of an "unnecessary growth in tension in 
this country" -- a choice of words that some deputies considered a veiled 
threat of martial law. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Solidarity leaders believe, Bentkowski either lost his nerve or 
decided to delay and press for a bigger price for his cooperation. According to 
the plan, Bronislaw Geremek was to open the Sejm meeting with an announcement 
that Solidarity was prepared to welcome the United Peasants and the Democrats 
into a new Solidarity-led coalition. 
</P>
<P>
But Geremek's statement contained no such bold declaration, only a statement 
that Solidarity would vote against Kiszczak. 
</P>
<P>
At last, Kiszczak's nomination was introduced and passed easily. Only a handful 
of United Peasants' Party deputies voted against it. Bentkowski was furious. 
</P>
<P>
And so, indeed, was Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
His closest aides said he first began to talk of a Solidarity government the 
day after the June election, in a state of near-euphoria. But the trade union's 
brain trust, including Geremek and longtime activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, 
counseled against it, arguing that Solidarity was not prepared to run a 
government and that the trauma would be too great for the Communists, who might 
overreact in opposition to it. Walesa went along. But as events unfolded, it 
seemed to him the time had come. 
</P>
<P>
The night of the United Peasants' Party's aborted revolt, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a 
newly elected senator and one of Walesa's closest aides, drove to the country 
home outside Warsaw where Walesa was staying with his wife's family. He got the 
Solidarity leader out of bed at midnight to tell him the story and to warn him 
that the United Peasants' Party was under heavy pressure. Walesa, Kaczynski 
said, had left instructions with the Sejm leadership to call him if a deal was 
about to be made. To his consternation, no one had called. 
</P>
<P>
From this point on, Kaczynski said, "Walesa decided to take this matter into 
his own hands." On Aug. 7, he issued a statement inviting the United Peasants 
and the Democrats to join a coalition that would exclude the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Kaczynski left Warsaw and met in northern Poland with Walesa. 
Also present was Kaczynski's twin brother, Lech, and another key Solidarity 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
"Walesa was now convinced," Kaczynski said, "that if he wanted to do this, he 
was going to have to go around the top leadership. So we worked out a plan, and 
I was assigned to go back to Warsaw and carry out the talks to arrange it. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about who should be prime minister, and it was decided -- Walesa 
decided -- it should be Mazowiecki. Later, there were other names mentioned, 
but the decision was Mazowiecki. It was always Mazowiecki." 
</P>
<P>
But Kaczynski, his brother and the other aide "were convinced that Walesa 
himself had to be the bait -- he had to offer himself for the job of prime 
minister. He was very nervous about this. He did not want the job. We told him, 
'Look, you're just the rabbit. Don't worry.' We talked from noon until about 5 
p.m. He agreed." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, when the upper-level Solidarity activists speak candidly, they did 
not welcome the idea of Walesa as prime minister either. One said of him: "He 
sings the tune, the rest of us march." The niggling, endless detail of the job, 
they all agree, "would drive Lech nuts." And yet the notion that he might take 
the job was the last, the irresistible, force. The deal, from that moment on, 
was essentially done. 
</P>
<P>
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, at that point the editor of Solidarity's weekly paper, was 
a close Walesa ally. Also important, he was close to the Roman Catholic Church. 
He was modest, never ambitious for power or influence, and Walesa trusted him. 
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski returned to Warsaw and cut the deal with the United Peasants and the 
Democrats. On Aug. 11, the Soviet ambassador in Warsaw met with the heads of 
both parties, apparently reassuring them that Moscow would not block their 
defection from an alliance with the Communists that went back 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Walesa came to Warsaw and sealed the alliance. That night he 
met with the Solidarity presidium in the Sejm. There was a long discussion, and 
at the end of it, Walesa said he would submit three names to Jaruzelski as 
candidates for prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Walesa returned to Gdansk, and Czeslaw Kiszczak resigned. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of Aug. 16, the arrangement complete, Solidarity, the United 
Peasants and the Democrats met in the Sejm in a joint caucus. This time Walesa 
arrived, triumphant, and played the act to the hilt. Walesa told the assembly 
that he would accept the post of prime minister. Referring to himself in the 
third person, Walesa said: "I never dreamed that Lech Walesa could be prime 
minister." 
</P>
<P>
Once the formal ratification of the new alliance was done, however, his tune 
changed. When, as he left the building, he was asked by journalists if he was 
going to be the new prime minister, he said, "Naw, there are . . . better men 
for the job." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Walesa met with Jaruzelski. He handed the general a slip of 
paper. Three names were written on it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my nominee," Walesa said, indicating Mazowiecki. "You can also say you 
considered the other two." 
</P>
<P>
The next day one Solidarity leader encountered Mazowiecki on the stairway of 
the Sejm. He remembered that, not long before, Mazowiecki had been among the 
four or five men who had reasoned most persuasively that the time still was not 
right for the government to be taken by Solidarity. Now, Mazowiecki had been 
chosen to lead it. How did it happen? 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki said it had happened on the night the leadership met with Walesa in 
the Sejm. 
</P>
<P>
"He came to me in the night, after the meeting," Mazowiecki said. "He said, 'I 
want you to be prime minister. You have a night to think about it.' " 
Mazowiecki smiled tiredly. 
</P>
<P>
"What else could I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 In Prague, rumors circulated widely that police would be issued live 
ammunition to control crowds at a planned demonstration to mark the 21st 
anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion on Aug. 21, 1968. Vaclav Havel took them 
seriously enough to issue a public appeal to cancel the protest. Ominously, the 
Czechoslovak government warned diplomatic missions in Prague that foreign 
tourists and journalists could be endangered by "illegal" demonstrations 
planned for the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 21, about 10,000 people demonstrated in Wenceslas Square. Police broke 
up the march by employing the usual method -- the truncheon -- and arrested 320 
Czechoslovak citizens and 50 foreigners.

<P>
BUDAPEST, CAUGHT BETWEEN EAST GERMANY'S HARD-LINE REGIME AND THOUSANDS OF 
REFUGEES, MAKES ITS CHOICE: 'WE HAD TO LET THEM GO.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was normal that East Germans came to Hungary in the summertime. They had 
been doing it for years, either in busloads on specially arranged holiday 
tours, or in their little plastic-bodied Trabant cars, enjoying the Hungarian 
food, the easy looseness of the place. 
</P>
<P>
They went to Lake Balaton and swam; the young people hiked about with backpacks 
and bedrolls and slept in crowded youth hostels or campgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
It was July before the Hungarians noticed that this year, something different 
was going on. 
</P>
<P>
The word circulated first through the Interior Ministry that increasing numbers 
of East Germans were crossing the border without proper papers. Since the 
border fence had been removed, they were crossing at isolated points along the 
frontier, sometimes sprinting past guards at road crossings. What were the 
instructions from Budapest? Certainly there was no question of shooting. But 
should the immigration officers be instructed to stop them, arrest them, or 
turn them back? The Interior Ministry was not sure what to do. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-July, the West German press agency reported that more than 90 East 
Germans had fled across the Hungarian border into Austria since the fence had 
come down in May. The Austrians kept a closer count. On the last weekend in 
July, they reported, 44 East Germans crossed the border illegally, raising the 
total, since the fence was dismantled, to 237. 
</P>
<P>
And now, almost overnight it seemed, 100 East Germans had moved into the lobby 
of the West German Embassy in Budapest. More were arriving daily, gathering at 
the embassy like pilgrims outside a church. They wanted to go West -- and they 
were prepared to stay for as long as it took. 
</P>
<P>
To Andras Hojdu, in the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, the events of the next six 
weeks were the logical extension of the changing political climate in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
His diminutive frame seeming even smaller in an expansively cut suit, Hojdu, 
intensely intellectual in his approach to problems, was regarded by most 
ministry professionals as the closest confidant of Foreign Minister Gyula Horn. 
From the beginning, his counsel to Horn was clear: Hungary had only one choice 
-- it had to let the East Germans go. 
</P>
<P>
For Hojdu, the choice was written in history, beginning with the slow 
transformation of Hungarian Communist politics in 1980. It had been carried on 
through men such as Horn, who for years had headed the Central Committee's 
international department -- in effect, the party's foreign policy strategists. 
Or Imre Poszgay, now in the limelight as the party's leading reformer; Rezso 
Nyers, soon to become head of the renamed Hungarian Socialist Workers' 
(Communist) Party -- now the Hungarian Socialist Party -- and Miklos Nemeth, 
the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary, in a style that was unique in the Warsaw Pact, had begun its 
revolution within the party. The process had gone so far that by the year's 
end, in the view of many Hungarians, the Communist Party would commit political 
suicide, change its name, lose almost 90% of its official membership and become 
a distinctly minority party. 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign policy represented a kind of flashpoint for the changes and reforms," 
Hojdu said. "Human rights were the key." 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's embrace of international -- that is to say, Western -- human rights 
standards could become a lever by which the entire Hungarian system could be 
moved. Indeed, one result of the document that Andre Erdos worked on for two 
years in Vienna was that the Hungarian Parliament was, at that moment, revising 
the Hungarian legal code to conform with its provisions on travel and 
emigration. 
</P>
<P>
In early August, Laszlo Kovacs, deputy foreign minister, met with his chief, 
Gyula Horn, and together they reviewed the options. Kovacs, 50, had worked with 
Horn for more than a decade. They were a close team: Kovacs a trim, elegant 
dresser, quick and brief in his analysis of problems; Horn, 57, white-haired 
and fit, an addicted morning jogger and a foreign policy specialist. 
</P>
<P>
There were two options, Kovacs said: "First, we could send the East Germans 
back. We dropped this immediately as politically and technically not feasible. 
Politically, it would have been contrary to our human rights concept. It was 
technically impossible because by this time, in Budapest alone, there were now 
between 1,000 and 2,000. In the rest of the country, we estimated another 
10,000, and we had no idea what they wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, over the next month, East Germans vacationing by the thousands in 
Bulgaria and Romania would be transiting through Hungary on their way home or 
wherever they were going. "There was only one solution that could be defended 
to the Hungarian and the world public," Kovacs said. "We had to let them go." 
</P>
<P>
He continued: "We examined the obstacles to this, and the legal barrier was a 
1969 bilateral agreement we signed with the German Democratic Republic. By the 
terms of the agreement, Hungary was not to let East German citizens proceed to 
any third country for which they did not have valid travel papers. Legal 
experts in the ministry examined the treaty and decided that it could not be 
canceled because it provides for a six-month prior notification. We had to find 
a much quicker solution -- and the solution was that the grounds for suspending 
the treaty could be that conditions had changed since the signing of the 1969 
document." 
</P>
<P>
The next issue was how to break the news to the East Germans. Prime Minister 
Nemeth sent messages to the West German government in Bonn and the East German 
government in East Berlin suggesting a meeting of prime ministers to discuss a 
solution. The East Germans declined, pointing out that party leader Erich 
Honecker and Prime Minister Willi Stoph were both ill. (Honecker, on July 8, 
had departed abruptly from a Warsaw Pact meeting in Bucharest, reportedly 
suffering from an acute gallbladder illness. The West German press had since 
been full of reports that he was gravely ill.) The West Germans responded 
eagerly, and on Aug. 25, Horn and Nemeth flew to Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
Erdos, in Budapest, was now among the small group working on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to keep it as low profile as we could," Erdos said. "There were a 
limited number of people working on it. There were legal and logistical 
considerations, and small teams were handling the problems. The Red Cross had 
become involved, and the Order of St. John's, the service organization, from 
both West Germany and here." 
</P>
<P>
The refugees were moved to a church in the Buda Hills, and two more camps were 
opened. Tents were erected and food and basic first-aid services provided. When 
Horn returned from Bonn, the West German government announced that reception 
stations were being set up in Bavaria to receive an undetermined number of East 
German refugees. There was still no word from East Berlin. Horn waited until 
Aug. 31, then flew to East Berlin to meet with Oskar Fischer, his East German 
counterpart. The session did not go well. 
</P>
<P>
Horn's approach with the East Germans was to urge that an agreement be reached 
between the two Germanys. Hungary, Horn said, had been caught in the middle. 
Certainly, he said, Hungary did not want to cause discomfort to an ally, but 
Hungary itself was in an uncomfortable position, and only action by the East 
Germans could relieve the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Horn stopped short of a threat, but he suggested to Fischer that if the East 
Germans did not arrive at what he called a "reasonable" answer, the Hungarians 
would have to devise their own solution. He did not spell out what it might be, 
but he assumed Fischer got the message. Horn repeated his government's position 
to a small gathering of East German Politburo officials. 
</P>
<P>
The party officials argued that the Hungarians should try to persuade the East 
Germans to return home. Horn, and later his aides, had the feeling that the 
East Germans were somehow unable to comprehend the scale of the problem. Surely 
they did not expect the Hungarian government to engage in counseling services 
for 10,000 citizens, all of them determined not to return home? It was 
preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
When the East Germans asked that their consulate in Budapest be given free 
access to the camps where the East Germans were waiting, Horn had no objection, 
although he knew this was no answer. He then returned to Budapest to await the 
East German response. 
</P>
<P>
There was none. The East German consulate dispatched a small trailer and a team 
of officers to a street corner near Holy Family Church in the Buda Hills, but 
it was a pitiful exercise, the officers spending most of their time fending off 
the jeers of fellow citizens. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 7, at the regular meeting of the Hungarian government, the decision 
was officially taken. "At the time," Kovacs said, "there had been talk that the 
government was divided on the issue between hard-liners and liberals, but that 
was not true. No one spoke against it. The decision was unanimous." 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians waited another day for a German response. On Sept. 8, Kovacs 
called in the East German ambassador, Gerhardt Vehres, and handed him a 
diplomatic note saying that if there was no further response from the East 
German side, the Hungarian government was suspending the 1969 bilateral treaty 
agreement as of midnight, Sept. 10 -- thereby allowing the East German citizens 
in Hungary to leave for any country ready to receive them. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, an urgent message came from Fischer, in East Berlin, 
personal to Horn. Because Horn was out of the city, Kovacs handled it. The 
message demanded that Hungary reverse its decision and appealed to Horn to use 
his influence to block the action. Kovacs, responding for Horn, declined. 
</P>
<P>
On the evening of Sept. 10, in an interview on Hungarian television, Horn 
publicly announced the government's decision. The buses were already waiting, 
and four hours later they rolled. The East Germans trooped aboard, whistling 
and shouting and flinging their East German currency out the bus windows. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized that what we did would have, or should have, some influence on the 
GDR (East Germany)," Kovacs said, "in the sense that we opened a kind of hole 
through which thousands of people could leave. 
</P>
<P>
"But at every point, when I spoke to the East German ambassador, when they told 
us we should send their people back, when they asked us to change our decision, 
they always argued in the same way. They tried to look for a reason outside 
their own country. They looked for the problem in Hungary. We argued that the 
problem was in the GDR." 
</P>
<P>
There was one more stiff exchange of notes. On Sept. 12, the East Germans took 
the unusual step of releasing the contents of a diplomatic message to the state 
news agency before delivering it to the Hungarians. The note charged Hungary 
with violating its international agreements. On Sept. 13, Kovacs summoned East 
German Ambassador Vehres to the Foreign Ministry and handed him Hungary's 
response, citing the legal basis for the decision and telling him that Hungary 
also had released the text of the message to the news media. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," Kovacs told him, "there are 100,000 ethnic Germans living in 
Hungary, and not one of them has left to go to West Germany, although they 
could do so at any time." Vehres, Kovacs said, had "no specific response." 
</P>
<P>
Vehres accepted the note and left, walked down the curving marble stairway and 
through the lobby to the front door. His dark-blue Volvo, flag flying on the 
fender, was backed in at the curb, its driver waiting. It was nearly night as 
the car moved out into the traffic along the Danube. 
</P>
<P>
 In Prague, the Czechoslovak Communist Party's chief ideologist said in a 
speech that Czechoslovak Communists must find their own path to reform and not 
give way to "dangerous" influences from Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union. 
Party leader Milos Jakes said a "great political struggle" would be required to 
counteract the activities of "various illegal groups" in Czechoslovakia. The 
streets of Prague were quiet.

Gabriel Paislaru, 38, is a translator and a journalist for the Romanian state 
news agency, Agerpres. Part of his job is guiding English-speaking foreign 
journalists around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Paislaru is a devoted believer in the Romanian system, described in the West as 
a combined Byzantine dictatorship and Stalinist-model police state. He sees his 
country through a rosier lens. 
</P>
<P>
When a visitor asks why armed police are on practically every street corner of 
Bucharest, Paislaru explains patiently: "They are to protect the people from 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
"But, according to the government," responds the visitor, "there is no crime in 
Bucharest." 
</P>
<P>
"That's why," Paislaru says.

<TEXT>
<P>
For the better part of a year, the upheaval in Eastern Europe has posed two 
central questions to George Bush and his foreign policy advisers: What do the 
changes in the Soviet Bloc mean for the West? And how should the United States 
and its allies respond? 
</P>
<P>
President Bush gleaned a key part of the answer, some aides say, from a most 
unlikely source: Poland's dour President Wojciech Jaruzelski, who tried to 
crush the Solidarity opposition movement in 1981, only to surrender a share of 
power to it in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on this path, the path of democratization, for good," Jaruzelski told 
Bush last July in a long meeting in the palace of Poland's 19th-Century kings. 
Moreover, he added, Moscow had given its full support to reform -- with "no 
limits" on Warsaw's freedom of action. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who had gone to Eastern Europe skeptical about the extent of the 
commitment to reform, was deeply impressed by Jaruzelski's apparent sincerity 
-- and by his message about Soviet policy. 
</P>
<P>
That afternoon, the President told Poland's new Parliament: "Because of what 
you're doing here, the genuine opportunity exists for all of us to build a 
Europe which many thought was destroyed forever in the 1940s." 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Bush wrote to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposing 
that the two meet -- the invitation that led to the Malta summit. 
</P>
<P>
The changes that have transformed Eastern Europe this year have had a dramatic 
effect on the Bush Administration's foreign policy -- far beyond the issue of 
U.S. attitudes toward what used to be called the Soviet "satellites." 
</P>
<P>
The sudden wave of freedom that has swept through Poland and its neighbors has 
changed the way Bush and his advisers look at the world. Once wary of 
Gorbachev, they now embrace the Soviet leader as a partner in diplomacy. Once 
skeptical of the chances for lasting change, they now proclaim the real 
possibility of an end to the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
"As I watched the way in which Mr. Gorbachev has handled the changes in Eastern 
Europe, it deserves new thinking," Bush told reporters at a meeting of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization earlier this month. "It absolutely mandates 
new thinking." 
</P>
<P>
"The issue had been, 'Is it going to last or not?' " a senior Administration 
official said. "But with Eastern Europe, you have got some events that, no 
matter what happens to Gorbachev, are probably irreversible. They can't be 
changed. The post-World War II order is gone. The Soviet Union has essentially 
allowed its bloc, which has been under its tight control, to just go away. And 
that is a transforming event." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europe is where the Cold War began 40 years ago, with Josef Stalin's 
installation of Soviet-controlled governments in the lands occupied by the Red 
Army at the end of World War II. Ever since, the world's two most formidable 
military forces have faced each other across a barbed-wire frontier, with 
nuclear missiles to back them up. For a long, white-knuckled generation, when 
strategists in the Pentagon drew up their plans for war, it was Europe they 
thought of first. 
</P>
<P>
Now, all that has changed. Thanks to the collapse of Communist power under 
popular pressure in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, the great 
confrontation that has dominated the second half of the 20th Century appears to 
be coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important development in the world today is the democratization of 
Eastern Europe," said Fred C. Ikle, an undersecretary of defense in the Reagan 
Administration. ". . . If East Germany becomes a democracy, the question of 
Soviet troops will simply go away." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is beginning to agree. "What these changes amount to is 
nothing less than a peaceful revolution," Bush said after his summit meeting 
with Gorbachev off Malta. "The task before us . . . is to consolidate the 
fruits of this peaceful revolution, and provide the architecture for continued 
change, to end the division of Europe and Germany, to make Europe whole and 
free." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Administration's cautious attempts to devise policies to advance 
those aims have been easily outstripped by events. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout most of the year, diplomats and intelligence analysts expected the 
Soviet Union to set some limits to the East Bloc nation's freedom of action. 
But beyond calling for the maintenance of the Warsaw Pact and opposing any 
early move toward the reunification of Germany, Gorbachev surprised U.S. 
officials by setting no other limits. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise of all was the sudden opening of the political system in 
East Germany, which officials expected to be one of the last Soviet Bloc 
countries to embrace reform. Bush and his aides were "amazed" when intelligence 
reports showed that Gorbachev had actively encouraged the overthrow of 
hard-line leader Erich Honecker, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's response has been characteristically cautious. Bush and 
his aides have emphasized that they want reforms in Eastern Europe to take 
place gradually, in a way that will not provoke a backlash from the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
As one surprising result, U.S. diplomats have pleaded privately with leaders of 
Hungary's democratic opposition to shelve their demand for withdrawal from the 
Warsaw Pact, because such a move might threaten the Soviet Union's sense of 
security. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to encourage them to leave the Warsaw Pact -- it would be 
unhelpful, so why raise it?" a State Department official said. "Besides, 
membership in the Warsaw Pact in no way inhibits their reforms."

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The big names had finished speaking, the early winter darkness was descending 
and many people were already drifting homeward from the biggest of a series of 
massive outdoor demonstrations that would, within days, end 41 years of 
one-party rule in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
So, little notice was taken on that late November day when opposition economist 
Milos Zeman took the microphone and delivered communism's epitaph. 
</P>
<P>
The last four decades have seen what was previously one of the world's most 
advanced countries plummet from 22nd to 72nd in the rate of its spending for 
education, he said. Czechoslovakia now ranks 49th in the percentage of 
university students among its young people, just ahead of Nepal. And the level 
of its once impressive technological development has fallen to that of Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
Its people have the second-shortest life expectancy (behind Hungary) among 28 
European countries, he continued, and the proportion of its territory 
devastated by pollution is the worst on the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
In his own way, Zeman was ridiculing the "absurd" argument by the architects of 
such failure that an anti-government protest strike called for the following 
Monday would disrupt the economy. 
</P>
<P>
But he could also have been sketching the outlines of the daunting task ahead 
as East European countries try to secure their breathtaking political gains of 
the last year and to find their place on a fast-changing Continent. 
</P>
<P>
For all the drama of 1989, the fact remains that the region has barely begun 
its transformation. "On one level, everything has changed," said Norman Stone, 
an Oxford University professor of modern history. "On another, nothing has." 
</P>
<P>
What has occurred so far is a revolution of expectations and, to some extent, 
in the methods of political decision-making. But the changes rest on little 
foundation except rejection of the postwar past. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990s promise a perilous journey of political, economic and social 
reconstruction during which the peoples of the region will be hostage to both 
Soviet and Western good will, neither of which will be unlimited. 
</P>
<P>
And while most now say that they believe the process of change in the region 
has gone so far as to be irreversible, few expect it to proceed as smoothly as 
it has to date. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it difficult to believe that somewhere along the line, someone won't 
try to stop it," commented Norman Davies, a professor of Polish history at 
London University's School of Slavonic and East European Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest question mark surrounds the future of Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. His hands-off policy as one Warsaw Pact ally after 
another rejected Communist Party dictatorship made the democratic gains of 1989 
possible. But now those same gains are fueling expectations at home that 
threaten the very existence of the Soviet Union in its present form. 
</P>
<P>
A possible backlash in Moscow has added to a sense of urgency among those 
trying to transform Eastern Europe. Some analysts, however, argue that things 
have already gone so far that, in order to reimpose Soviet control, a new 
Kremlin leader would have to order the occupation of virtually the entire 
region -- an impractical step even for Moscow's formidable military. 
</P>
<P>
Developments in Eastern Europe may even constitute a Machiavellian form of 
insurance for Gorbachev, in this view. The reason: Even as they have dumped 
their Communist leaderships, the democratizing nations of the region have 
pledged their continuing loyalty to the Warsaw Pact alliance. But if a 
hard-line alternative to Gorbachev appeared, their turn to the West could 
become a stampede as they scrambled to distance themselves from Moscow, and 
abandoned the alliance in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Another major strategic question mark is the future of Germany. Long the 
pre-eminent economic power on the Continent, West Germany is fast becoming its 
political pivot as well, with the issue of German reunification suddenly near 
the top of Europe's agenda. Whatever the outcome of that emotional and complex 
debate, however, the Federal Republic is already well ahead of the other 
Western nations in establishing its influence on the other side of the 
disappearing Cold War divide. 
</P>
<P>
Tactically, the immediate task for the peoples of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East 
Germany and Poland is to confirm their commitment to pluralism at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's Parliament is expected to dissolve itself this week and to call first 
truly free, multi-party national elections in two generations for no later than 
March. Czechoslovakia and East Germany are expected to follow by summer. 
</P>
<P>
Poland, which was the first country in the region to break with its Communist 
past during partially open parliamentary elections last June, is scheduled to 
hold free local elections early next year. While less eye-catching than the 
national polls of its neighbors, Poland's local balloting could be crucial in 
purging still dangerous pockets of hard-line Communist resistance to change in 
the provinces. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the democratic spectacle of elections lurks a worry, however, as the 
more or less united opposition movements that brought down totalitarian rule 
themselves divide into competing political parties, altering the balance of 
political forces in unpredictable ways. It has already happened in Hungary, 
where the so-called Alliance of Free Democrats and the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum took opposite sides in a November referendum. 
</P>
<P>
What pre-World War II democratic traditions exist in these countries are based 
on a large number of political parties -- 20, 30 or more in each -- meaning 
that, at best, their first freely elected parliaments are likely to yield large 
and unwieldy governing coalitions of the Israeli or Italian type. 
</P>
<P>
Besides elections, there is a vast body of laws in each country to be updated. 
It is indicative that most of the activities that brought down Prague's 
Communist government in just three weeks remain illegal under statutes still on 
the books. 
</P>
<P>
These countries also must restructure their judiciaries to make them truly 
independent. In Poland, for example, judicial appointments are still the 
prerogative of the Communist president, Wojciech Jaruzelski -- although a 
pro-Solidarity parliamentary panel was recently created to "advise" him in the 
task. 
</P>
<P>
It would be tough enough to overhaul Eastern Europe's political and legal 
structures in an otherwise strong, stable economic and international 
environment. What exists is quite the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
While the situation varies from country to country, the economies of the region 
are so crippled that it may well be near the end of the next decade before they 
can begin to enjoy the kind of even modest prosperity that would be the best 
assurance of political stability. Until then there exists a serious risk of 
social unrest in response to the inevitable unemployment, inflation and other 
dislocations associated with deep economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Catching up with the West is an even longer-term dream. "Even if the East 
German economy were to grow at twice the rate of the West German economy, it 
would still take 20 years . . . more for it to catch up," according to Heinrich 
Machowski, an economist at West Berlin's German Economic Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest challenge, said Radio Free Europe analyst Patrick Moore, is 
to reorient "a whole complicated system of values" internalized during four 
decades of Communist rule. He described them as "patterns of interpersonal 
relations, attitudes toward authority, attitudes toward the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
How long does it take to build respect for law when for years the only law has 
been whatever the party bosses say it is? Will populations excluded from 
politics for two generations now take an active part? And if they do, will the 
political extremism that plagued their prewar past resurface? What will be the 
problems of reviving cultures distorted by existing mostly in the underground? 
</P>
<P>
The main enemy, contended Gabor Damszky, a longtime dissident now among the 
leaders of Hungary's Alliance of Free Democrats, is "the bureaucratic 
mentality. People have to become lords of their lives, and that is going to 
take a long time. Here, somehow, we are waiting -- for orders coming from the 
center." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to establish another culture of manufacturing industry," noted Csaba 
Csaki, rector of Budapest's Karl Marx University. Csaki sees Western influence 
as crucial. "Even if a specific (joint Hungarian-Western) project isn't going 
to make any profit (for Hungary), it should go ahead." 
</P>
<P>
The West has so far pledged about $8 billion in aid, mostly to Poland and 
Hungary, to boost the process of democratization -- but there are strings 
attached. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial concerns are also surfacing even at this early stage. In the United 
States, some Bush Administration officials reportedly are worried about 
so-called tied aid used by some European countries to boost exports. They will 
loan money to Eastern Europe on condition that it is spent on products produced 
in the donor nation. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most frequently advanced vision of a future Eastern Europe 
foresees a system of satellite states on the periphery of the European 
Community being exploited for cheap labor. However, Radio Free Europe analyst 
Jan DeWeydenthal cautioned, there is as yet no guarantee that Western Europe 
will open its borders to such products. 
</P>
<P>
After 40 years of separation, the peoples of East Germany, Poland, Hungary and 
Czechoslovakia likely feel themselves more "European" as a result of the 
stunning changes of the last year. They also know that the hard job of turning 
the feeling to reality remains ahead.

10 YEARS, 10 MONTHS, 10 WEEKS AND 10 DAYS; 
</P>
<P>
WITH BREATHTAKING SPEED, THE EAST BLOC HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED. BUT THE STRUGGLE 
IS NOT OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Trotsky or Mao or Che Guevara might have said in another context, the 
struggle continues. 
</P>
<P>
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, after four months as the first non-Communist prime minister 
of Poland, looks as tired as he did the day he told Lech Walesa he would take 
the job. Walesa went to Washington and became one of three foreigners who were 
not heads of state to have addressed a joint session of Congress. He was given 
a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki went to the Kremlin for his first Warsaw Pact summit conference, 
flanked by his old antagonists, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and Mieczyslaw 
Rakowski, who seemed proud to have him along. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian prime minister, Miklos Nemeth, is only 44, but is weary also, 
perhaps a lame duck, and is deeply uncertain about Hungary's economic future as 
a soon-to-be parliamentary democracy. Having arrived at its threshold with 
relative ease, the nation seems disinterested in politics and dispirited over a 
declining economy. 
</P>
<P>
Egon Krenz has come and gone, replaced last weekend in East Berlin by Gregor 
Gysi, at 41 the youngest party leader in Eastern Europe. He is a defender of 
the rights of opposition parties and reconciled to early free elections and 
their probable result -- the end to Communist leadership in East Germany. Erich 
Honecker, expelled from the party, is under house arrest and may, along with 
others who served with him, face formal charges of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Petar Mladenov has thrown the hard-liners off the Bulgarian Politburo and, if 
demonstrations in Sofia continue, may have to go soon himself. Todor Zhivkov's 
33 luxury villas have been turned over to the use of schools, youth scouting 
groups and medical clinics. 
</P>
<P>
In Prague, Ladislav Adamec resigned as prime minister and a new government 
chief, Marian Calfa, 43, last Sunday formed a government with Communists in the 
minority. Among the new ministers are a number of the old government's former 
prisoners. A deputy prime minister, Jan Carnogursky, who got out of jail only 
three weeks ago, will help supervise the Interior Ministry, which controls the 
state police. Free elections are expected in June. Milos Jakes, in a state of 
apparent bewilderment, wandered off beyond the sidelines and was heard no more. 
Gustav Husak resigned as president. Vaclav Havel, in jail this year from 
January to May, was regarded as his most likely successor. 
</P>
<P>
How did it happen? A comment now making the rounds in Eastern Europe says it 
took 10 years in Poland, 10 months in Hungary, 10 weeks in East Germany and 10 
days in Czechoslovakia -- and when the time does come, it will take 10 hours or 
10 minutes in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Did it start with Poland in January, or when the elections that showed 
Communists could relinquish power -- would have to relinquish power -- without 
blood in the streets? Would East Germany's leaders have gone, and then 
Czechoslovakia's, if the Hungarians had not been determined to tear down their 
border fence? Would any of it have happened without Mikhail Gorbachev? Or would 
there have been a Gorbachev without a Communist system in terminal crisis? 
</P>
<P>
When news got out that the Hungarians wanted to remove the red star from atop 
the Parliament building, 18 companies submitted bids to do it for free. A 
French firm offered to buy it for $60,000. Only the French could spot a trend 
so fast: Fashion's thirst for nostalgia claims a symbol of repression, hated by 
millions, and makes it trivial. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the red star will go without lament, because it was not trivial. In 
Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria, 90 million people 
lived under it for 40 years, with another 22 million in Romania still waiting. 
It ruined rivers, forests and lives without number, and the damage it brought 
cannot be calculated. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1989, though, some accounting was about to begin, and a start on 
a new era of history for Eastern Europe.

With regard to your Critic's Corner column on Dec. 3, I have no idea what 
section or portion of the television-viewing population I represent, but I 
disagree with the entire thrust of the piece. I thoroughly enjoy reenactments! 
I think Fox TV popularized the "simulated reenactment" concept on contemporary 
television, which would help explain what I believe is Fox's steady rise in 
grass-roots popularity of late: It knows what the public wants. My verdict is 
still out on whether reenactments are acceptable for actual, current on-air 
news items; but if they are clearly labeled, any reasonable person will accept 
them as such.

THOSE WANDERING BANDS RETURN; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVELING CAN BE AN ADVENTURE OR A CHORE, SAY MUSICIANS WHO WILL PERFORM AT 
BENEFIT CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If a musician wants to be heard, to forge a name that the music world knows, 
then it becomes necessary to reckon with the road. 
</P>
<P>
For those who have some years beneath their treads, who have to leave spouses 
and children at home, it can be a hard reckoning -- but it is one that they 
continue to make so long as the dream of being heard remains too dear to give 
up. For others, young and free from family responsibilities, the road can be a 
path of unalloyed adventure and enchantment. 
</P>
<P>
For aspiring rockers such as Frank Daly, 22-year-old singer for Big Drill Car, 
or Chad Forrello, 24-year-old guitarist for National People's Gang, the road is 
a still-fresh place of exuberant discovery, where even setbacks, hardships and 
absurdities can seem like a lark. 
</P>
<P>
For Adrian Remijio, singer and lead guitarist of the Wild Cards, the road 
sometimes can seem like a sacrifice. It's hard not to question the traveling 
life when you are 30, with a wife and a baby at home, and less money coming in 
than you used to make working a steady job in a warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
For blues bandleader James Harman, the road is part of a musical tradition that 
he has lived since he was a boy in Alabama. If you play the kind of music 
Harman does, it means you travel -- although in his mid-40s, and with two small 
boys at home, Harman thinks hard these days about how he can break through to a 
new level of success that would make his road easier. 
</P>
<P>
What all of these musicians have in common is that today, the road brings them 
home to Orange County, where they will play in the daylong Orange County Music 
for the Needy benefit at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. The event, in 
its fifth year, will once again raise money and collect food and gifts to 
provide a bountiful holiday for poor families. And it will give the 
much-splintered, too-often-submerged, and always-overshadowed Orange County pop 
music scene its annual showcase and day of community. 
</P>
<P>
Today is a good day for music fans to go out and get acquainted with what the 
local pop scene has to offer. For Calendar, it offered an occasion to check in 
with four of the acts on the benefit bill who have spent a good deal of 1989 
away from home. We asked how the road has been treating them. 
</P>
<P>
James Harman Band 
</P>
<P>
For Harman, full-time travel has turned the blues into a small business, where 
the condition of the touring bus gets as much attention as the music he's 
supposed to be writing for his next album. 
</P>
<P>
The singer-harmonica player was in Vancouver last week, waiting to play yet 
another show on yet another concert swing, when he phoned in the James Harman 
Band's annual report. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had one single week off. I looked it up just the other day. It looked 
like 220 or 230 dates," Harman said. "It's wonderful to be working so much. As 
always, I'm thankful. But I need some time. I wish there was more time." 
</P>
<P>
Harman said that the question of time -- time for home life, time to incubate 
new music -- came up recently when he spent a three-day break in Houston 
hanging out with ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Man, we've got to get you to the next level, so when you come home 
you can relax for a month and write songs.' I said, 'You're right, and right 
now I have to work all the time.' It's a stagnating situation. It's what kills 
a lot of people, drives them out of the business or into something more 
commercial. But I've just got something in me. I've got a real high threshold." 
</P>
<P>
Harman, whose band is composed of drummer Stephen Hodges, bassist Jeff Turmes 
and guitarist Joel Foy, has a dual recording career: in one, his singing and 
harmonica playing stay anchored in traditional blues. In the other, he puts out 
blues-rock albums that shoot for the kind of mainstream success achieved by 
such peers as Robert Cray and the Fabulous Thunderbirds. That's the path to the 
"next level." 
</P>
<P>
Harman said his current level brought a lot of satisfaction in '89. On one of 
his two tours of Europe, fans in the front rows at a music festival in Holland 
started calling out "Sweet Home Alabama James," in honor of Harman's Southern 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
"Realizing that you've got recognition out of your country for what you've been 
doing so long, it's just exciting," Harman said. Back home, Harman won 
recognition with three nominations for the W.C. Handy Awards, the blues 
equivalent of the Grammys. While Harman ended up an also-ran in his categories 
-- best miscellaneous instrumentalist, best contemporary blues album ("Extra 
Napkins") and best blues band -- he ran in good company with the likes of such 
winners as Cray, James Cotton and Albert Collins. 
</P>
<P>
There is little letup ahead in 1990. Orange County-based Rivera Records will 
release a new album of an old Harman Band concert, "Strictly Live in '85." Two 
other albums Harman recorded in 1989 will come out on foreign labels -- a 
Canadian release pairing him with guitarist Amos Garrett, and a French release 
that captures the Harman Band playing live in New York with fiddler Papa John 
Creach. Meanwhile, Harman will be working on more commercially oriented songs 
for a blues-rock album on Rhino Records. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, the road stretches on. "I can already see three European tours 
and at least two or three times around the United States and two or three times 
to Canada," Harman said. "I guess it's just nonstop. That's what you get: It's 
the old thing, 'Be careful what you wish for, you might get it.' But this is 
what I do. I've been doing it 30 years now. I can't stop now." 
</P>
<P>
The Wild Cards 
</P>
<P>
James Harman's warning about how a musician can stagnate on the road hasn't 
been lost on Adrian Remijio. Since 1988, Remijio and the Wild Cards have been 
touring regularly, trying to separate themselves from the cluttered pack of 
roots-rock contenders. From the weary but determined tone in his voice as he 
talks about the Wild Cards' travels, you can tell that Remijio is already well 
beyond the stage where the road means glamour. Rigor is more like it for a band 
that spent about half its time in '89 trying to generate a following in 
barrooms across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The road is great, but that's not what I want to do the rest of my life," said 
Remijio, who still works part time as a painter and construction worker when 
the Wild Cards aren't on tour. "This is what I always wanted to do, but I never 
wanted to be stagnant. It seems we're stagnant right now. I want to get to 
bigger venues, and the only way is to write the (hit) song and get it started. 
We're just trying to really concentrate on songs that will get us airplay. We 
want to head in a direction and just hit it." 
</P>
<P>
For the Wild Cards, whose lineup also lists singer-guitarist Jesse Reyes, 
drummer Jesse Sotelo Jr. and Remijio's half-brother, Albert Farias, on bass, 
coming up with a radio hit could be a longer shot than it is for most. The 
band's music ranges through funk, blues, jump swing and Latin salsa -- a 
combination that makes their lively shows a delight but poses a problem when it 
comes to fitting into today's straitjacketing radio formats. 
</P>
<P>
As far as money is concerned, Remijio said, he was in better financial shape 
back when he was working the warehouse job he quit in order to travel with the 
Wild Cards shortly before the release of "Cool Never Cold," their 1988 debut 
album for Chameleon Records. 
</P>
<P>
"Going by what I used to make, it's nowhere close," said Remijio, whose wife 
works to help support a family that includes a 14-month-old son. "It makes you 
think sometimes, 'What am I doing?' But music's not all about money. You can't 
fool yourself about paying your dues." 
</P>
<P>
For Remijio, the road still holds payoffs even when the money is thin. 
</P>
<P>
"When the crowd really flips, it's 'I'm here for a reason.' We're still playing 
new places and seeing new people. It's always a challenge to win them over. A 
lot of times we play and they don't dance but just watch. You feel you got 
stiffed, but then they come and ask for your autograph and want to buy albums." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Remijio reconciles his wariness of the road with the realization that 
it is the only path to take him where he wants to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see myself out on the road playing these clubs and bars and being 
content. It's very positive, but I want more. If I knew this was as far as I 
was going to get, I wouldn't have quit my job. But I know that somewhere down 
the line, it's going to happen. It's discouraging at times, but you've got to 
keep on doing what you do. The only way you're going to get anywhere is by 
surviving and keep on hitting it. 
</P>
<P>
"After a two-month tour, if I leave the guitar alone for even one week, I've 
got to play. It feels good, I still have that want. I don't think I'll put it 
down for a long time yet." 
</P>
<P>
Big Drill Car 
</P>
<P>
For Frank Daly, touring with Big Drill Car means riding around the country day 
after day without knowing where you're going to sleep at night. That would be a 
depressing prospect for most people. But for Daly and his three band mates, 
it's the path to adventure. It's like that when you're 22 and doing what you 
enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
The accommodations always end up being taken care of, Daly said, usually 
through the kindness of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
"It never ceases to amaze me how nice people are," he said. "Usually, when you 
play, somebody will offer, 'You guys can crash out on my floor and take a 
shower.' It's hand to mouth, but it's really exciting. Everyone in the band is 
pretty much into it. You feel like Davy Crockett or something. You never know 
what you're getting yourself into." 
</P>
<P>
Along with bassist Bob Thomson, guitarist Mark Arnold and drummer Danny 
Marcroft, Daly was on tour for about five months in 1989, trying to develop a 
following for Big Drill Car's melodic brand of hard-edged, punk-influenced 
rock. Trips across the country in the spring and fall didn't turn Big Drill Car 
into headliners, and the band's travels yielded losses instead of profits. But 
it didn't dim Daly's enthusiasm for the road. Even a strange happenstance that 
would make some traveling bands think of giving up turned into a story that he 
retells with zest. 
</P>
<P>
"The last show of our (fall) tour was supposed to be in St. Louis. We had to 
get there from northern Wisconsin. But our van broke down in Madison, Wis." 
</P>
<P>
Big Drill Car found itself facing a lost night and a big repair bill. But a 
strange thing happened: The owner of the car dealership where they got their 
van repaired decided that he would put this idled punk band to work. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Business is kind of slow. I want to throw a party. I'll get a PA 
system, and you guys can play in the showroom.' We played to just the car 
salesmen. People were coming in to pick up their cars and walking out plugging 
their ears. Playing "Mag Wheels" (one of the band's songs) in a car showroom 
with a picture of Lee Iacocca behind us felt like it never has before. That was 
definitely the weirdest thing that happened on this tour." 
</P>
<P>
Big Drill Car's touring so far has been largely a do-it-yourself affair, 
without a record label to back the band with promotional push. But the band's 
first label release, "Album Type Thing," has come out (on Cruz Records), so the 
next time the band tours it will have a company behind it. 
</P>

"Our tours have gotten progressively better," said Daly, who works for a 
lithographer when he isn't on the road with his band. "This one, we came real 
close to breaking even. The one before, we came home $4,000 in debt. Hopefully, 
the next one we can make a little money. Imagine that. It'll be interesting to 
see what happens on a tour with a real label behind you. With the first record 
(the "Small Block" EP, which Big Drill Car put out on its own), you could 
pretty much count on no one having heard of the record or you." 
</P>
<P>
Big Drill Car has no problem with the idea that its road to recognition in 
alternative rock circles could be gradual. "Right now, it helps if we go in 
support" of a better-known headliner, such as label-mates All, Daly said. "And 
it'll probably be that way for the next tour and the tour after that. No matter 
what, there's no better thing you can do for your band than playing in front of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
National People's Gang 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke last week about National People's Gang, Chad Forrello had just 
returned to Corona del Mar after four months on the road (a "four-month binge," 
as he put it) and a night without sleep. He still managed to sound unflaggingly 
upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
"We've become a better band," the guitarist said. "The more you do it, you just 
start tapping into this very primordial energy. It just exudes when you start 
playing. It's fun -- that's the key element. I could go out next week for 
another month." 
</P>
<P>
For NPG, which has released two albums for Dr. Dream records, touring is a bit 
more upscale than it is for the carpet crashers in Big Drill Car. The four-man 
band travels by motor home. "It's very domesticated," Forrello said. "We cook 
and clean and do laundry. It's just that your house moves and has an engine in 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Among the strangest sights that NPG encountered on its odyssey were the 
billowing stage smoke and flashing lasers that accompanied the astonished band 
as it went on stage for the biggest show of its tour -- a slot opening for the 
Village People (of all people) at an outdoor show for about 5,000 fans on a 
college campus in Hamilton, Ontario. All that flashy stage gimmickry was absurd 
for an alternative rock band that doesn't go in for arena-rock conventions. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hysterical," said Chad Jasmine, NPG's vocalist. "We have a live 
recording of it, and a lot of the time, I'm laughing rather than singing." 
</P>
<P>
The most satisfying moments of the tour came when the band, with bassist Deyo 
Glines and drummer Anthony Arvizu, saw evidence that heavy touring since 1988 
has begun to build a following for NPG. 
</P>
<P>
"In Lincoln, Neb., they were yelling out for songs we haven't even recorded," 
Forrello said, guessing that fans must have made bootleg tapes at a previous 
performance in the town, where NPG's new "Orange" album has received extensive 
college radio play. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that it gets better and better each time you come 
back," Forrello said. "As far as the money goes, eventually it'll be more 
important. For now, you can walk away from the experience with nothing, and it 
really doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
According to Jasmine, 26, the most lucrative music-making of the tour took 
place not on stage, but on the streets of Toronto, where he and Forrello earned 
$160 one day with their acoustic busking. 
</P>
<P>
To Forrello, the only drawback to touring for four months straight was that NPG 
wasn't able to pursue its goal of winning 
</P>
<P>
recognition in Los Angeles to go with its existing base of support in Orange 
County and Long Beach. But if more Orange County rock bands were to go out and 
make a national name for themselves by touring, he said, that L.A. connection 
might not be quite so vital. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many bands that are complacent," Forrello said. "It's time to 
start whacking people over the head: 'Wake up! Orange County has a lot of great 
music.' The only way is to get out there and take over. I hate saying 'South of 
L.A.' when people ask us where we're from. I want to be able to say 'Orange 
County' and be able to have people associate it with good music instead of 
Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Music for the Needy benefit runs from noon to about midnight 
today at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. The 
schedule calls for the James Harman Band to play at 3:45 p.m., National 
People's Gang at 5:15, the Wild Cards at 6:45, and Big Drill Car at 9:45. The 
donation is $7, or an equivalent value in canned foods or unwrapped new toys.

OUTLOOK: ORANGE COUNTY IS COMING OF AGE ON THE EVE OF THE 1990S, BUT IT FACES 
NEW RESPONSIBILITIES.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County stands on the brink of the 1990s like an adolescent coping with 
new-found size and muscle. 
</P>
<P>
The county, more than ever, is bigger, brassier and bolder, the rich kid on the 
block. No longer content to be a bedroom community, it has become an economic 
force in national and foreign marketplaces, emerging as a leading center for 
high-technology and biomedical research and design. 
</P>
<P>
But at home the county is betwixt and between. Sociologists, politicians and 
civic leaders say the '90s can be the decade when Orange County comes to terms 
with its phenomenal growth and strides toward its prime. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything in the '90s relates to maturing," Claudette Shaw, president of the 
Laguna Art Museum, said. "We've been a promising, unruly adolescent, but it's 
time to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
However, traffic, homelessness, deteriorating roads and sewers, unaffordable 
housing, trash and polluted air loom as stumbling blocks for a county viewed by 
many as unwilling to grapple with the growing pains that are eroding the 
quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
The urban tensions that plague older metropolises will manifest themselves here 
in the '90s as the county becomes more ethnically diverse, as the gap between 
rich and poor widens, the population gets grayer and the last vestiges of 
suburban life disappear, experts say. It is the price the county will pay for 
its transformation from a string of independent towns to an urban center of 
commerce, arts, finance, sports and cutting-edge research and scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County, once and for all, will finally become a great metropolis in its 
own right, not just a suburban extension of Los Angeles," predicted UCLA 
professor Allen Scott, a noted economic geographer who studies Orange County 
trends and life styles. "It will be a dynamic place to live in the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
For the 2.6 million people who will live, work and play here by the turn of the 
century, it promises to be a decade of remarkable change -- toll roads opening, 
the coming of professional basketball or hockey, an expanded arts scene, 
increased political clout, new communities, revitalized older cities and 
clusters of shiny new office towers. But there is a flip side to the future -- 
waiting lists, unaffordable housing, government regulations, ethnic friction 
and traffic, traffic, traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's lucky that Orange Countians like to drive and love their automobiles, 
because they are going to spend a lot of time behind the wheel," said Jeremy 
Anwyl, an Irvine-based automobile consultant. "Lots of people will probably 
spend as much time in their cars as they do at home." 
</P>
<P>
It's a depressing scenario, one that has increasing numbers of Orange Countians 
daydreaming about less-congested ZIP codes. But Marty Elkins of Tustin isn't 
ready to jump ship -- not yet anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new decade. Let's think positive," said Elkins, a salesman. "Maybe 
things will turn around. They can't get worse. Besides, I'm curious about how 
things are going to turn out." 
</P>
<P>
The prospects are enticing. 
</P>
<P>
At long last, the $310-million expansion of John Wayne Airport will be finished 
with its gleaming new passenger terminal, parking towers and even a proposed 
monorail system to whisk business travelers to key employment centers. But even 
before officials snip the ribbons on the stunning additions, the facility will 
be outdated, unable to meet the county's soaring demand for air travel. So the 
search will continue for a second regional airport, possibly in the canyons and 
hills behind coastal San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Sports fans can anticipate a new arena to lure a professional basketball or 
hockey team, if Anaheim and Santa Ana -- acting like feuding cousins -- ever 
decide which of them will build it. 
</P>
<P>
Art lovers will be able to wander the halls of the Newport Harbor Art Museum's 
new $50-million home -- a potential lightning rod for artisans who have long 
complained about the dismal gallery scene locally. 
</P>
<P>
The county will be more powerful politically as it gains a probable sixth seat 
in Congress. A high-speed train, which some are nicknaming the "Gamblers' 
Express," might link Anaheim with Las Vegas. Hikers and mountain bikers will 
rejoice at the prospect of half a dozen new regional county parks spread across 
19,000 acres of canyons, ridges and coastal wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
But for each acre preserved, two will be plowed under. 
</P>
<P>
Earthmovers and jackhammers will continue transforming South County ranchland 
into housing tracts. Three, possibly four new cities may spring up in 
Saddleback Valley and there is talk in the backcountry of forming a canyon 
community to protect Modjeska, Silverado and Trabuco canyons from overzealous 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people will settle in whitewashed communities clustered along the 
Foothill Tollway, the county's first toll road, which will link Tustin with 
Rancho Santa Margarita and its "downtown of the future." Envisioned by planners 
as the main shopping district for residents in the county's rapidly growing 
eastern and southern foothills, the Town Center will join specialty stores, 
offices, movie theaters, parks and a central library through a network of 
pedestrian walkways and bike paths. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be the kind of place where you would want to spend a Saturday," said 
Donald Moe, a Santa Margarita Co. executive. 
</P>
<P>
But while change and growth may be most striking in the south, planners point 
with pride to rebuilding the downtowns -- and images -- of cities in older 
corners of the county in the '90s. Huntington Beach expects to blossom into a 
tourism and shopping mecca for the west county as it adds four major hotels to 
the city's waterfront and a glitzy shopping pavilion at its rebuilt pier. 
Capitalizing on its freeway-close access, Brea is expected to be a magnet for 
relocating corporations and North County consumers flocking to rejuvenated 
retail districts on Brea Boulevard and Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim is bullish on plans for $4-billion worth of high-rise office 
construction in the Platinum Triangle, a 200-acre swath of prime real estate at 
the confluence of the Orange, Garden Grove and Santa Ana freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Technological advances will give thousands of county workers the freedom to 
boot up their workday from home or a neighborhood office rather than commuting 
bumper to bumper to corporate headquarters. Telecommuting -- using personal 
computers, fax machines and telephones -- will become an affordable option. 
</P>
<P>
But the push-button advances of the '90s won't improve everything. 
</P>
<P>
Count on waiting in line for everything from traffic signals to housing. 
</P>
<P>
Securing a slip for a 35-foot sailboat in Newport Harbor may take five years. 
There's no wait yet for Angel baseball season tickets, but should pitcher Mark 
Langston, the team's newly acquired $16-million man, help bring club owner Gene 
Autry a World Series, that could change. Several thousand people are reportedly 
waiting for word about the first offering -- still two years away -- of 
million-dollar homes and lots overlooking the Pacific in the ritzy Irvine Coast 
development south of Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The wait will also be long for affordable housing. In the midst of one of the 
nation's wealthiest counties, where the median income is $41,181 -- and 
climbing -- affordable housing for the middle- and low-income population will 
have become just a pipe dream. Waiting up to three years for federally 
subsidized housing in one county program is common today. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 8,000 people on our waiting list, and it's growing," said Sandra 
McClymonds, executive director of the Orange County Housing Authority. "And 
there is no reason to believe that the demand will lessen." 
</P>
<P>
Lines at soup kitchens and temporary shelters may also lengthen. The ranks of 
the county's homeless, numbering between 5,000 and 10,000 today, could double 
by the end of the decade when a median-priced home is expected to top $500,000. 
Squeezed by some of the nation's highest living costs, a growing class of 
disadvantaged -- the "underemployed" -- may swamp the already overwhelmed and 
underfunded public agencies to seek assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"A husband and wife, both working 40 hours a week, earning slightly above 
minimum wage, with a family, can't survive now in Orange County," said Scott 
Mather, chairman of the Orange County Homeless Task Force. "How can we expect 
them to survive the '90s without some help?" 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is the prevailing attitude in a county where spending and 
consuming is often pursued with Olympic-like fervor, experts say. More 
attention has been paid to accumulating wealth than sharing it, a mind-set 
private planning consultant Al Bell hopes will end in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a decade when we invest more of our energy and time in people," 
said Bell of the Planning Center, a Newport Beach-based firm. "This county must 
-- and will -- confront the whole array of social issues that attend an 
affluent community with immense depths of poverty. Contending with those issues 
can be as leading-edge as designing a new housing development or computer parts 
or roadway. 
</P>
<P>
"That's part of growing up. That's part of our responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Government will reach into the lives of Orange Countians in new ways. New air 
quality regulations may spell the end for drive-through windows at fast-food 
outlets as idling autos are targeted as major polluters. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, all cities in California must divert 50% of their garbage 
from existing landfills. That's a tall order for a county which annually 
generates a hefty two tons of solid waste for every man, woman and child -- by 
far the highest per-capita ratio of any county in the nation. Mandatory 
curbside recycling -- currently a voluntary program in a half dozen cities -- 
will be in place countywide by the late '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, our live-it-up, throw-it-away life style will give way to a more 
frugal way of thinking," said Frank Bowerman, director and chief engineer of 
the county's waste management program. "We have got to turn the corner and 
confront this problem." 
</P>
<P>
But government so far has been stumped by the transportation crisis. Don't look 
for any quick fixes. 
</P>
<P>
Average freeway speeds during rush hour are expected to drop from 25 m.p.h. to 
18 m.p.h. during the '90s. Even more disturbing is Caltrans' prediction that 
stop-and-go conditions during peak commute periods will triple, lasting up to 
three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, traffic increasingly will dominate peoples' lives. Congestion will factor 
into nearly every decision from where to live and work to where to shop and 
recreate. The automobile will remain king of the road, despite promising 
proposals to build light-rail transit or overhead monorails to transport 
commuters. The number of registered vehicles in the county by 1999 could jump 
by nearly half a million. 
</P>
<P>
Opening a 7.3-mile portion of the Foothill Tollway in 1994 will deliver some 
relief. So will the completion near the end of the decade of the county's 
second toll road, the 15-mile-long San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor, 
stretching from Newport Beach to San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Sections of the Santa Ana Freeway through Tustin, Santa Ana and Anaheim may 
also be widened during the '90s. But transportation planners say it won't be 
nearly enough, and that worries Bob Winslow, a Fullerton resident who commutes 
50 miles a day to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I like what Orange County is becoming culturally. I enjoy the recreation 
opportunities, having a football and baseball team close by and all the 
amenities of a big city," he said. "But what scares me most is the threat to my 
access, the fear that I won't be able to drive anywhere because of gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
Coping with congestion will remain a full-time preoccupation. Cellular phones 
in county cars and trucks will likely triple to 300,000 during the decade as 
more and more motorists conduct business behind the wheel to make up for lost 
office time. In addition, sales of high-quality, expensive car stereos are 
expected to be brisk as drivers seek to drown out traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is one of the most lucrative car stereo markets in the world," 
smiled Jim Holland, a Huntington Beach stereo installer. "People spend $2,000 
or $3,000 without batting an eye. They want to escape the traffic." 
</P>
<P>
No wonder. It is going to be more crowded -- everywhere. Another 262,000 people 
are expected to settle here by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the new arrivals will speak different languages or come from foreign 
lands. Minorities will make up 35% percent of the population by the turn of the 
century. One out of five county residents will be Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"The ethnic mix of Orange County will only accelerate," Cal State Fullerton 
sociologist Myron Orleans said. "The salad bowl of race and culture that we are 
becoming can be one of our strengths in the '90s. Minorities will bring a 
cultural diversity that has been lacking in this county for so long." 
</P>
<P>
But absorbing immigrants and minorities into mainstream Orange County won't be 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
Without extensive job and language training, steady, upwardly mobile employment 
may be out of reach for many. Highly skilled labor will be in demand in the 
'90s to fill the 250,000 new jobs in the county as the region remains a 
manufacturing center of computer chips, medical equipment and aerospace parts. 
Complicating the business equation is a predicted downturn in defense spending, 
which will force many Orange County companies to retool and prompt workers to 
learn trades or wind up unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
But the challenges are not insurmountable, some argue. 
</P>
<P>
"Educating the next generation is critical," said Father Jaime Soto, vicar of 
the Latino community in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange. "We are seeing in 
the disappearance of the blue-collar job market in Orange County. And unless 
the current generation of Latino children get educated, they will not find a 
niche in this county. We need to wake up to what is happening." 
</P>
<P>
The same may be said about county residents in general who complain in growing 
numbers about density, crime and pollution, but so far have not solved the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Peter Morrison, a RAND Corp. demographer, are optimistic about the 
'90s in Orange County. Unlike their neighbors in Los Angeles, Morrison 
believes, Orange Countians will act before it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the people living in Orange County moved there because of the promise 
of a better life, and they are unlikely to let it go without a fight," Morrison 
said. "I think the '90s is a crossroads decade for the county -- a time when 
people will fight back and recapture what they've worked so hard to create."

ORANGE COUNTY 1990; 
</P>
<P>
FOR COMMUTERS, MORE OPTIONS BUT MORE TRAFFIC TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Orange County commuters of the 1990s will have more transportation options, 
including a gleaming monorail, trolleys, a high-speed train, toll roads and 
special freeway ramps reserved for buses and car pools, say traffic planners. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, "smart streets" and "smart corridors" will become commuter buzzwords 
as traffic flow is turned over to control centers with computers utilizing 
artificial intelligence to analyze delays, recommend solutions and fine-tune 
signal timing on surface streets near clogged freeways. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the high-tech wizardry, the next decade will still be dominated by 
the solo driver wrapped in the chrome, steel and glass of the private 
automobile, frustrating most efforts to relieve traffic congestion, these same 
experts add. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, traffic planners say, the 1990s will see average rush-hour freeway 
speeds drop from the current 25 m.p.h. to 18-20 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Says Joe El-Harake, Caltrans' director of special projects: "One hour of delay 
(stop-and-go traffic) today will become three hours by 1999." 
</P>
<P>
Almost unanimously, respondents to an informal Times mail survey agreed that 
traffic will still be the Orange County's worst problem. 
</P>
<P>
Even law enforcement officials interested in building more jails listed traffic 
congestion as the decade's biggest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The county's internal growth alone adds more than 60,000 vehicles each year to 
Orange County streets and freeways. County residents already spend more time in 
traffic delays than their counterparts in Los Angeles, according to a regional 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Some relief, however, is on the way, based on these predictions -- and working 
plans -- of transportation experts: 
</P>
<P>
* A monorail will link John Wayne Airport with a privately owned office complex 
across the street. The line probably will be extended to the Amtrak station in 
the Irvine Spectrum area and link up with monorails now being considered by 
five Orange County cities. 
</P>
<P>
* A privately owned, 300-m.p.h. magnetically levitated super-speed train will 
link Anaheim with Las Vegas, serving as a land ferry for Inland Empire 
residents commuting to job-rich Orange County. The train's Anaheim terminal, 
near Anaheim Stadium, is expected to become a major rail hub with connections 
to Amtrak and local commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
* More than 65 miles of publicly owned tollways in southern and eastern Orange 
County will be open by 1997. Frequent users will deposit money in advance into 
a special account that can be debited directly, with electronic scanners 
reading coded windshield tags for vehicle owner identification. It may also be 
possible to debit credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
* An extension of the Orange Freeway along the Santa Ana River may be built as 
a private toll road. 
</P>
<P>
* High-tech traffic-control centers will monitor traffic flow with a 
combination of buried pavement sensors, closed-circuit TV cameras, radar and 
possibly satellite reconnaissance, with computers then able to recommend 
solutions to traffic jams and adjust signal timing on freeway ramps and surface 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
* Although there is talk of building a new regional airport, it won't be ready 
for 15 to 20 years, increasing pressure on John Wayne Airport's new passenger 
terminal, scheduled to open in September, 1990. Airlines serving John Wayne may 
begin offering flights to Washington and even New York. But fares will be high, 
predicts airport manager George Rebella, because even the business market won't 
find enough seats to satisfy demand. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Steve Hogan, director of transportation in the county's 
Environmental Management Agency, says commuting on the ground "should be a 
little shorter in terms of time, and I hope in terms of distance as well, with 
people living closer to their jobs than they do now." 
</P>
<P>
But, lacking funds to build new freeways, the emphasis will be on high-tech 
traffic management, experts agree. There's even talk of somehow using the 
county's existing freeway emergency call box network as a cheap way to monitor 
traffic and feed data to traffic control computers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like we're in the movie 'Back to the Future II,' " says Stanley T. 
Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County Transportation Commission. 
"There's no telling what little things we do now will affect traffic several 
years from now."

HOUSING: THE COUNTY'S GROWTH PICTURE WILL BE SHAPED BY CONSTRUCTION IN 
UNTOUCHED AREAS AND THE REBIRTH OF CITIES LIKE HUNTINGTON BEACH AND BREA.

<P>
To planners and developers, the 786-square-mile puzzle known as Orange County 
is not yet fully assembled, but all the pieces are lined up. Although the 
county won't be built out for another 30 years, its final look will take shape 
as development reaches the region's last frontiers in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
* Construction may begin early next year on South County's newest planned 
community, Talega Valley, a 5,000-home development with resort hotels and 
shopping centers in the hills and canyons behind San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
* In Orange, officials have approved an unprecedented plan by the Irvine Co. to 
build 12,000 homes, a hotel and a major recreational complex on the city's 
eastern fringe. Despite objections from environmentalists worried about 
congestion and pollution creeping into nearby canyons, the first units in the 
mammoth 7,110-acre development could be for sale by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
* The last big undeveloped stretch of Orange County coast will be altered by a 
fleet of bulldozers carving ocean view home sites out of the gently sloping 
foothills. About 2,600 homes, many of them in the million-dollar category, are 
planned for the Irvine Coast between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Harder to spot, but equally important to the growth picture in the '90s, will 
be the rebirth of cities like Huntington Beach and Brea, areas that have been 
the focus of aggressive redevelopment drives overshadowed by South County's 
dramatic changes. 
</P>
<P>
It all adds up to more people, more cars and more demands on county and 
municipal services in the next decade, forcing civic leaders to confront new 
complexities in such areas as transportation, family services, law enforcement, 
health care and education. This breakneck pace of development disturbs San Juan 
Capistrano rancher Tom Rogers. One of the county's principal slow-growth 
advocates, Rogers foresees no end to the trend of high-density projects, 
despite a critical shortage of roads and services, particularly in South 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"This county is a ticking time bomb," warned Rogers, a leading proponent of a 
sweeping slow-growth measure defeated by voters in November, 1988. "Even if no 
more development entitlements are issued in the '90s, we've got a serious mess 
on our hands." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers blamed the situation on rapid-fire approval of development agreements 
establishing the maximum size of projects in the final months before the vote 
on the slow-growth initiative. "That hysterical granting of entitlements 
immediately prior to the election laid the seeds for self-destruction in the 
1990s," Rogers said. "Now the developers have their approvals and we've got 
only promises for more roads and services. It's a bad deal." 
</P>
<P>
County planners disagree, saying they've learned significant lessons from past 
practices and that developments such as East Orange and Aliso Viejo in South 
County reflect a more enlightened approach. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than build strictly bedroom communities, developers are being required 
to locate employment centers nearby to reduce traffic on freeways. For example, 
business parks in the proposed East Orange development are expected to create 
26,000 jobs by early next century. 
</P>
<P>
Open space, more than ever, will be a hotly debated component in future 
developments. As public demand for parklands mounted in the 1980s, developers 
had to deed an average of 50% of the land proposed for development to the 
county for parks or recreational uses in exchange for project approvals. 
</P>
<P>
The result appears to be a windfall of land for county park officials. 
Tradeoffs with developers are expected to double the county's current 19,000 
acres of regional parkland in the coming decade as half a dozen new preserves 
are dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. officials boast that their showy coastal development south of Corona 
del Mar will stand as a benchmark for blending open space and residential 
construction. About 75% of the 9,432-acre project will be left in its natural 
state or transformed into greenbelts, including the entire coast on the ocean 
side of Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a model on how to deal with an ecologically sensitive piece of land," 
said Ray Watson, vice chairman of the Irvine Co. "It represents a compromise, 
something you're going to see more of in this county when it comes to 
development." 
</P>
<P>
Developers may be more conciliatory because many county residents are openly 
frustrated with traffic and density. Officials, developers and 
environmentalists point to the massive October rally against the Irvine Co.'s 
3,200-home Laguna Laurel project in Laguna Canyon as evidence of a new 
grass-roots movement. 
</P>
<P>
"It has reached even the highest income levels," said Tom Pratt, environmental 
director of the Surfrider Foundation, a nonprofit group that monitors coastal 
development. "People work 50 hours a week to have a nice home, a nice car and a 
nice family only to see the air get more polluted, the roads get more congested 
and find no parking when they go to the beach. They are fed up, and developers 
will get the message." 
</P>
<P>
With land values soaring, and the amount of available real estate nearly 
exhausted, older cities in central and North County are likely to turn to 
redevelopment in growing numbers to capitalize on the county's popularity as a 
business and retail center. 
</P>
<P>
"Possibly the most dynamic changes in the '90s may occur in North County, in 
places like Brea," said Kenneth R. Smith, transportation director of the 
county's Environmental Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting along the Orange Freeway, just a few miles south of densely settled San 
Gabriel Valley in Los Angeles County, Brea is blessed geographically. It plans 
to capitalize on that by spending millions to redevelop its downtown shopping 
district and attract new companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We've even got plans to landscape the banks of the flood control channel that 
runs through town and use its natural configuration to hold outdoor concerts in 
the summer," said Brea Councilman Wayne D. Wedin. "South County may get all the 
ink. But things are happening here too."

Ten years from now, Orange County will be older, richer and nearly 300,000 
residents larger. Planners and developers predict that people will be living in 
new homes with views of rolling foothills or ocean sunsets, working in new 
office towers overlooking freeway junctions, buying in shops in revitalized 
downtowns, playing in new regional parks, and getting away from it all with the 
help of an expanded airport terminal. In the next 10 years, more than 14,000 
more people will have died of AIDS, and twice as much jail space will be 
needed. And as they integrate increased stresses and new technology, Orange 
County residents might even utter a new word or two. Here's a closer look.

New development and redevelopment -- not to mention a gleaming new home for a 
professional sports team or two -- will spring up on Orange County's terrain 
during the next decade. Orange County's largest capital improvement project -- 
John Wayne Airport -- will be completed next year. In addition, five regional 
parks are planned to be added to the landscape in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
1. ANAHEIM STADIUM: Nearly $4 billion in high-rise development is targeted for 
the Platinum Triangle: 200 acres stretching from the stadium to the junction of 
Garden Groved, Orange and Santa Ana freeways. A sports arena is planned near 
the Big A to attract a pro basketball or hockey team, and the stadium may be 
the terminus of a proposed high-speed Las Vegas-Southern California train. 
</P>
<P>
2. HUNTINGTON BEACH: The city's downtown and central pier area, totaling 336 
acres, will be transformed into a shopping and tourist center for west county 
with a $55-million waterfront hotel, set to open in summer, 1990, and a complex 
of theaters, eateries and night clubs. Three more hotels and several hundred 
luxury condominiums also are planned. 
</P>
<P>
3. SANTA ANA: Redevelopment and new projects worth more than $1.5 billion will 
alter the look of the county seat as business and retail centers replace bean 
fields along stretches of Main Street and older buildings on 1st Street. A 
privately built sports facility also is planned, in an attempt to lure a pro 
basketball or hockey franchise, if the city can beat Anaheim in the arena race. 
</P>
<P>
4. EAST ORANGE: Irvine Co. breaks ground in 1992 on its largest single planned 
community ever, a 12,350-unit residential development covering 7,110 acres 
along Rancho Santiago Road. It is a phased development with 2,700 acres of open 
space and twin business parks expected to create 26,000 jobs by its completion 
after the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
5. GYPSUM CANYON: The ridges and slopes of the pristine canyon south of the 
Riverside Freeway will be the site of either a new 6,720-bed jail or a 
10,500-unit housing development proposed by the canyon's owners, the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
6. IRVINE SPECTRUM: By 1990 nearly 80,000 people are expected to work in 
offices and manufacturing plants spread across 2,600 acres near the junction of 
the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways. 
</P>
<P>
7. Irvine Coast: Completion expected by end of decade on 2,600 homes and two 
major resort hotels to be built on the last remaining large undeveloped stretch 
of Orange County coast. About 75% of the 9,432 acres in the project will remain 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
8. ALISO VIEJO: One of South County's biggest planned communities nears 
completion by year 2000 with many of the development's 50,000 residents 
expected to work in nearby offices and plants built within the project. 
</P>
<P>
9. RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA: As residential building continues, construction 
begins by 1994 on Town Center, a mix of retail shops, offices, movie theaters 
and medical suites with pedestrian walkways that planners herald as the 
"regional downtown" for a string of communities from Portola Hills south to 
Coto de Caza.

Buzzwords 
</P>
<P>
Want to be user-friendly with the 1990s? Looking for something to do while you 
zoom down super-streets, on your way to your flex place? Join the Smart crowd 
by studying expected buzzwords of the '90s -- compiled from interviews with 
planners, futurists and other sources -- and you can speak the language of the 
future today. 
</P>
<P>
Hot-housing -- Forcing children to mature too quickly, akin to the way 
gardeners force early blooms on plants. Examples would be giving kindergartners 
tests before they move on to first grade, taking youngsters to R-rated movies 
with their parents, or 8-year-olds putting themselves on diets. 
</P>
<P>
Baby boomerangers -- Adult children of baby boomers who return to their 
parents' homes, unable or unwilling to make their own way in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Latchkey seniors -- Ailing elderly parents who live with their grown children 
because they need care but who are left unsupervised while their children go to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwich generation -- Adults who are being squeezed in the middle, taking care 
of two generations. These are parents who are bringing up young or teen-age 
children at home while also caring for their own elderly parents, who are frail 
and no longer independent. 
</P>
<P>
Tech head -- an '80s term describing someone who is computer hip. It is 
expected to be used less often in the '90s as computers become more user 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
Alternative scenarios -- A term used by futurists to say there will be a 
variety of courses that the future could take in a certain situation, such as 
what the results of the "greenhouse effect" will be. 
</P>
<P>
Ice -- The smokable form of methamphetamine that will be the drug of choice in 
the coming decade, according to law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
Flex place -- The variable location where one conducts work, either an office, 
home or car. 
</P>
<P>
Telecommuting -- Working at home, connected to the workplace by telephone and 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
PATH -- A traffic management system being developed by the state Department of 
Transportation that controls vehicles with computers. It is envisioned that 
maps and traffic information will be displayed on screens installed in cars. 
The system, which stands for Program on Advanced Technology for the Highway, 
also could include automatically steered cars, which would "read" information 
in highway markers. 
</P>
<P>
Super-streets -- Busy streets that are transformed into streamlined 
thoroughfares by constructing grade-separated intersections with ramps (akin to 
freeway off-ramps), synchronized signals, bus turnouts and other changes to 
speed the traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling corrections -- An economy that will avoid a nationwide recession by 
having mini-recessions in specific industries or regions that are countered by 
good times inother sectors. 
</P>
<P>
Virtual reality -- A three-dimensional illusion of being in another place. This 
"virtual reality" is generated by wearing computerized goggles and a glove, 
which can simulate any possible experience. Homeowners, for example, can 
explore their new house before it exists and, says VPL Research Inc., a Redwood 
City firm marketing virtual reality equipment, the possibilities for home 
entertainment are limitless. 
</P>
<P>
Highway advisory radio -- Low- frequency airwaves -- on the low side of the 
radio band -- over which traffic information will be broadcast to drivers, like 
the instructions now given over the radio to people driving into Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Gilded ghettos -- Schools and communities isolated from the nation's changing 
demographics, and places where families go to escape racial tension and end up 
cutting themselves off from social changes. 
</P>
<P>
Smart House -- A revolutionary gas, plumbing and wiring system that enables 
total home automation via one cable and generic outlets in each room. When the 
system becomes available in 1991, it will be able to do everything from 
automatically brewing the morning coffee to alerting the household when an 
appliance is not working. 
</P>
<P>
Smart Card -- A card that looks like a credit card but which is in fact a 
hand-held computer with a microprocessor and memory, capable of carrying 
information such as medical records, car maintenance records, the password to 
your computer and other personal data. For example, by carrying your medical 
and insurance records, the Smart Card being marketed by AT&amp;T will 
facilitate rapid treatment in an emergency medical situation. 
</P>
<P>
Smart Corridors -- Thoroughfares managed with computers that are fed 
information about traffic snags and then determine solutions. For example, the 
computer could decide to route cars around an accident by diverting them onto 
surface streets and changing the timing of traffic signals to accommodate the 
extra cars.

TREE FARMS TAKE FRESH APPROACH TO TRADITION

<P>
Wandering amid the two acres of live Monterey pine at the Orange Christmas Farm 
on a recent sunny day, Keith Kenney was looking for the perfect tree. 
</P>
<P>
Kenney and his two daughters Dana, 6, and Erin, 8, had set out to surprise Mom 
-- Grace Kenney, a registered nurse who was cooped up studying for refresher 
courses -- by bringing home a special Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
"She's always wanted this type," said Kenney amid the forest of living pines. 
</P>
<P>
He knew that choosing a tree from a farm was a little more expensive than 
taking home a pre-cut one from a lot -- in fact, twice the amount he says he 
usually pays for a tree. But the 33-year-old engineer said this had been a 
special year. 
</P>
<P>
"With school and working -- it's been a real strain, so this will be a real 
special Christmas for us." 
</P>
<P>
Sentimental holiday enthusiasts, longing for the look and scent of a fresh 
evergreen to fill their homes this Christmas season, have been abundant during 
recent weekends, searching the county's live tree farms for the pine of choice. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we had to take our tree down the day after Christmas; it was so dry, 
it was a fire hazard," said Cynthia Kareem of Yorba Linda, as her husband, two 
children, a friend and a next-door neighbor roamed among 5,000 pines at the 
Bailey-Findley lot in Yorba Linda. "Hopefully it will be fresh." 
</P>
<P>
Most customers visiting one of the more than a dozen farms throughout the 
county defer to staff workers to do the chopping. But a few brave souls, 
including 8-year-old Omar Kareem and his neighbor, Scott Woodward, 9, prefer to 
take saw in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Now if you cut it, you have to carry it too," Jim Bailey, part-owner of the 
lot, told the boys after they had felled a six-foot Monterey pine, which is the 
type offered at most lots because they grow so well in the county's climate. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the twosome carry the pine from deep inside the farm to the 
parking lot, they heaved it over the side of the Kareem family's Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that heavy," Omar said. "It was fun." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said his parents aren't buying a tree this year because of the fire 
hazard, but he was sure that he would spend time enjoying the tree at his 
neighbor's house. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been wishing I could have a great, big Christmas tree high as the 
clouds," he said as he nestled in the back of the Jeep with Omar and the tree. 
</P>
<P>
At Santa's Forest, also in Yorba Linda, where wooden bridges take shoppers from 
the jam-packed parking lot off Yorba Linda Boulevard into a serene and shady 
five acres of evergreens, some buyers found the freshness of just-cut trees a 
worthy investment. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see any dead stuff in here," said Stan Jablecki of Brea as he moved 
aside the branches of a pine, revealing a nearly perfect green tree. "The last 
thing you want is a fire. No matter what the cost, what's the cost of your 
home? It's a lot more than a Christmas tree." 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife Sue said they have been buying fresh-cut trees for about 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got pictures of little Elizabeth standing on the trunk" of the chopped 
tree, said Sue Jablecki, referring to the couple's now 16-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Holmes, who has worked at the Santa's Forest lot for 16 years, says that 
even fresh-cut trees need special care. 
</P>
<P>
He suggests that buyers chop off the bottom of the trunk just before they put 
the tree in water, and add fresh water every few days. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who has sold Christmas trees for 20 years, said the trend is for 7- and 
7 1/2-foot trees, and especially ones that are full, fat and perfectly shaped. 
But he said everyone has a particular preference.

SOVIETS VISIT TRW LAB FOR PRECEDENT-SETTING BRIEFING ON SDI WORK; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: THE U.S. HOPES THE TOUR FURTHERS ITS PROPOSAL FOR REGULAR LAB VISITS 
BETWEEN THE SUPERPOWERS AS PART OF A 'STAR WARS' TREATY.

<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-member delegation of Soviet scientists and arms negotiators broke new 
ground in East-West relations on Saturday by touring a vital component of the 
United States' "Star Wars" research. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets' visit to the 2,770-acre TRW Inc. laser testing facility, nestled 
in the grassy hill country one mile north of San Clemente, capped months of 
planning between Soviet and American arms reduction negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet delegation was very pleased and interested in the tour," said a 
senior Bush Administration official who attended the precedent-setting visit to 
a U.S. laboratory conducting sensitive research on the controversial Strategic 
Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the visit "went a long way to demonstrating the value" of a new 
atmosphere of scientific cooperation that is being proposed in ongoing arms 
reduction talks in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be identified, was referring to a United States 
proposal that was put on the table in Geneva about two weeks ago. The proposed 
Defense in Space Treaty would set up ground rules for the development of 
space-based defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
One of the elements of the proposal is reciprocal laboratory visits. U.S. 
officials believe that the visit will set the stage for annual data exchanges 
between the two superpowers, and will convince the Soviets of the value of 
regular laboratory visits. 
</P>
<P>
First announced in September, Saturday's tour and inspection of the "Alpha" 
chemical laser system was billed as an extension of the Geneva strategic arms 
reduction talks, said Marine Lt. Col. Alan R. Freitag. 
</P>
<P>
Other than holding an impromptu press conference when the Soviets arrived 
Friday at the Marine Corps Air Station in El Toro, organizers of the tour 
maintained strict control over information about the tour. Neither the news 
media nor local officials were allowed to accompany the group on the tour 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have even declined to say where the visitors spent the night on 
Friday, or whether they returned to the Marine base after the tour of the 
plant, located in unincorporated land at the end of Avenida Pico. 
</P>
<P>
The TRW facility is home to the Alpha laser, a component of SDI's Zenith Star 
program, company officials said. Under the Zenith Star program, American 
researchers are hoping to develop a satellite-based laser that would detonate 
nuclear warheads in mid-trajectory. 
</P>
<P>
From the laser testing facility, the Soviet group was expected to move on to 
tour the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, another center where SDI 
research is being conducted. 
</P>
<P>
At Los Alamos, the Soviets will examine the BEAR, or Beam Experiment Aboard 
Rocket, a project that is developing rocket-mounted devices that would generate 
powerful beams of atomic particles. The particle beams would be able to either 
identify or destroy incoming missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Whisked into South County without any fanfare, the Soviets were led by 
Ambassador Yuri Nazarkin, head of the Soviet delegation to the strategic arms 
and space defense talks in Geneva. They were briefed by American scientists, 
company executives and military personnel, said Julie Wright, director of 
public affairs for TRW Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very good exchange," Wright said about the all-morning meeting. After 
lunch, she said, the 30-member contingent of scientists, government 
representatives and military personnel boarded a bus and drove for five minutes 
to the laser testing site that is built on a corner of the sprawling facility. 
</P>
<P>
Once there, the group examined parts of the Alpha laser testing equipment for 
about three hours, she said. Dressed in sterile "bunny suits," the Soviets 
climbed inside a 50-foot-tall vacuum chamber that houses the hydrogen fluoride, 
high-power laser, Wright said. The vacuum chamber simulates a space 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
The group then returned to the center's main building for a "wrap-up," and left 
the site at 4:15 p.m., Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets were allowed to examine segments of the laser system that is still 
in early stages of development, Wright said, but were not allowed to see the 
apparatus at work. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time Soviet officials have been privy to any part of 
America's controversial Strategic Defense Initiative project, proposed by 
President Reagan as a shield against nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The $250-million Alpha device, under research for more than a decade, has long 
been described as the Pentagon's most promising technology for a small, 
lightweight laser that could be built with enough power to operate as a weapon 
in space.

Two men were in critical condition Saturday in the burn unit of UCI Medical 
Center in Orange after their Chevrolet pickup truck exploded in flames during a 
rush-hour collision Friday evening in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the driver, Rocco Costello, 28, of La Mirada and passenger Craig 
Gauthier, 28, of Whittier were both severely burned. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was engulfed in flames when police and rescue workers arrived at the 
scene of the accident on Imperial Highway just east of Valencia Avenue. 
Gauthier apparently managed to crawl out a window of the truck and Costello was 
pulled from the burning wreckage by passers-by, a fire official said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the police account, Janet Askew, 29, of Placentia was driving a 
Mustang east on Imperial Highway when she lost control of her car, jumped the 
median and collided with the pickup truck and two other cars. Askew was taken 
to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana where she was in stable condition Saturday. 
Police are still investigating the accident. No one has been charged.

ASIA WARMS UP TO AMERICAN FAST FOOD;

Will the next generation of Asians shun curbside noodles, curries and other 
indigenous food in favor of American burgers and fried chicken? 
</P>
<P>
Although the answer is still inconclusive, a recent U.N. report says American 
fast food has made major inroads across Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"Fast food is the latest mega-trend in Asia where it is definitely making an 
impact on the culture and life styles of the people, as the people begin to 
have less and less time for a formal meal," says the report, "The 
Socio-Economic Impact of Transnational Corporations in the Fast Food Industry." 
</P>
<P>
The report quoted one Australian-based executive as saying, "Asians are 
vulnerable toward fads from the West and some franchisers regard Asia and other 
unexplored markets as potential dumping grounds for franchises."

According to the study, U.S. fast-food chains are most prevalent in Japan, 
where there are 350 McDonald's franchises and 649 Kentucky Fried Chicken 
outlets, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong follows close behind, while popularity is growing in the Philippines, 
Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan. Thailand is a relative latecomer, but business 
is booming. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Kentucky Fried Chicken does best in Asia, with McDonald's second. 
</P>
<P>
The first two attempts in Thailand to introduce fast food were unsuccessful. 
The British chain Wimpy's arrived in 1964, followed by Kentucky Fried Chicken 
in 1970. Both closed soon after U.S. soldiers returned home from the Vietnam 
War. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mister Donut broke into the market in 1978 and paved the way for six 
other U.S.-based franchises. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the report, Bangkok had 60 fast-food outlets, including 25 
Dunkin' Donuts, 14 Mister Donuts, seven Pizza Huts, four Kentucky Fried 
Chickens, two McDonald's and one Dairy Queen. More are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Polls of customers at McDonald's in Bangkok showed they chose to eat there 
because of brand loyalty, persuasion by their children, convenience and 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The study notes that World War II played a major role in introducing American 
fast food to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Den Fujita, a McDonald's franchise operator in Japan, is quoted as saying 
postwar changes in Japan, such as the introduction of bread and milk into the 
schools by Americans, enabled the Japanese to adapt more easily to hamburgers 
and milkshakes. 
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the American GI diet became a new status symbol after World 
War II. A whole generation of middle-class Filipinos in the postwar years were 
raised on hot dogs, pork and beans, corned beef and Vienna sausages. 
</P>
<P>
China is one of the few major countries in Asia that has not readily taken to 
the fast-food industry. An exception is the successful two-story Kentucky Fried 
Chicken restaurant on Beijing's Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
As for the future of American fast food, the report provided one clue: "Having 
experienced the clean and cool atmosphere of fast-food restaurants, children 
refuse outright to eat at hawkers' stalls, though the food there is much more 
delicious and priced more cheaply."

<P>
Even Scrooge, on his worst bah-humbug days, might have shed a tear at the 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
What appears at first glance to be a jolly Santa's workshop in this Washington 
suburb is actually a torture chamber for Christmas toys that is worthy of the 
Spanish Inquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Working behind closed doors in a small room stacked high with Yuletide goodies, 
Bob Hundemer, the Torquemada of the toy business, is gleefully wrenching the 
nose off a cuddly teddy bear. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a bespectacled helper is calmly dismembering a stack of dolls with 
blonde tresses, yanking off their arms without a trace of emotion. At his elbow 
are the shattered remains of dump trucks, airplanes and baby rattles, and bits 
of stuffing from disemboweled toy animals. 
</P>
<P>
They are working in the toy testing laboratory of the U.S. Consumer Product 
Safety Commission, and their tables are crowded with diabolical devices 
specifically designed to fold, spindle and mutilate -- or worse. 
</P>
<P>
Clamps and torque wrenches are applied to the eyes of lovable toy monkeys. 
Teething rings are dropped in pots of boiling water. Stuffed bears are battered 
with finger-like probes. 
</P>
<P>
Is this guy the Grinch who stole Christmas, or what? 
</P>
<P>
"No, I feel more like the good witch of the North," says Hundemer, chief of the 
two-man laboratory housed in the drab former barracks of an abandoned Nike 
missile site about 15 miles northwest of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
With extra help to cope with the Christmas rush, Hundemer and his assistant, 
Garfield Jenkins, work full time testing about 900 toys annually for potential 
safety hazards to children. 
</P>
<P>
Hundemer estimates that more than two-thirds -- many of them mass-produced 
imports from Mexico or the Far East -- flunk the commission's stringent 
standards. They are either recalled for redesigning or banned from the market 
as unfit for putting under the Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 245 toys were voluntarily recalled by manufacturers at the agency's 
urging. Some of the worst offenders were displayed at a Dec. 1 news conference, 
when the commission gave its annual Christmas warning to toy-buying parents. 
</P>
<P>
By far, the biggest threat posed by hazardous toys, which accounted for 142,000 
injuries and a minimum of 22 deaths last year, are small parts that children 
can easily detach with their teeth or fingers and put in their mouths, causing 
choking or asphyxiation. 
</P>
<P>
Most choking deaths involve balloons, marbles and other small balls, says John 
E. Preston, a mechanical engineer who designed many of the agency's toy-testing 
procedures. But balloons and marbles are exempt from government safety 
regulations because of their universal popularity as children's playthings. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we tolerate the 10 deaths of children every year from choking on 
balloons?" Preston asked. "On the other hand, we don't believe the world is 
ready to accept a ban on balloons and marbles. We're perplexed about what we 
can do." 
</P>
<P>
Hundemer says he has "compelling reasons" for his personal interest in toy 
safety as the parent of two small children. 
</P>
<P>
The government can't begin to test all the 150,000 different toys on the 
market, he said, "so don't depend on the government to provide you with 
complete safety." Parents must play an active role in monitoring toy safety. 
</P>
<P>
Look for durability and quality of construction, he says, and select toys 
suitable for a child's age and skills. Avoid buying toys with small parts or 
long cords for infants or toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
Be particularly cautious about small balls and toys that shoot projectiles or 
contain electrical heating elements. Consult label precautions and follow 
instructions. Supervise children at play, and repair or discard damaged toys 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be fooled when a clerk says, 'We couldn't sell it if it weren't safe,' " 
Hundemer said. "That's not true, and people who believe that are misguided."

THE CHALLENGE OF THE BATTLEFIELD;

LEADERSHIP IS THE GOAL FOR CADETS

The soldiers lay in shallow foxholes on a recent warm, windy morning, eating 
chicken a la king and pork patties from plastic envelopes and waiting for the 
enemy. 
</P>
<P>
The enemy began to appear on the far ridge. Thirty or 40 soldiers appeared at 
the top of the hill. The troops in the foxholes talked about wiping them out 
with one mortar round -- but they had no mortars. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the ROTC cadets didn't want to touch off a brush fire from sparks 
and flames coming out of their rifles, and they certainly didn't want to kill 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
They and the attacking "army" were participating in a simulated attack -- an 
"airmobile insertion" -- as part of a weekend training venture at Camp 
Pendleton in San Diego County for ROTC cadets stationed at Cal State Fullerton, 
Claremont College, Cal State San Bernardino and Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can teach them to take 40 people and take that hill, we can teach them 
to run a finance division," said Army Maj. Kenneth Sadekas, who runs the ROTC 
program at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"Leadership is the primary goal here," said Army Capt. Jack Roberts, who 
teaches in the ROTC program at Claremont. "The real skills are thinking, making 
plans and making decisions." He said the cadets are not only getting a college 
education but they are also learning leadership skills that most students don't 
get until they are out of school. James Robbins
