<P>
Chang Chun, a former premier of Nationalist China and presidential adviser who 
helped influence Taiwan's foreign policy for decades, has died of heart and 
kidney failure, a hospital reported. 
</P>
<P>
He was 101. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who died Friday, entered the Veterans General Hospital on Monday for 
treatment of heart and kidney ailments that were complicated by flu, a hospital 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Chang was the last surviving elder of the governing Nationalist Party who 
joined Sun Yat-sen in a revolution on the Chinese mainland that led to the 
overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
Chang was a classmate of the late President Chiang Kai-shek at the Tokyo 
Military Academy in Japan. He later served as Chiang's top aide in battles 
against warlords and Communist forces on the Chinese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
He was the Nationalist government's premier in 1947-48. 
</P>
<P>
In 1949 the government lost a civil war to the Communists and fled to the 
island of Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan, Chang served as Chiang's chief of staff and adviser until the 
president's death in 1975, and played an influential role in mapping the 
government's foreign policies. He also served as an adviser to Chiang's son, 
former President Chiang Ching-kuo. 
</P>
<P>
Chang is survived by two sons, Chi-cheng, an adviser to President Lee Teng-hui, 
and Chi-chung.

ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Merrill's call for change in the environmentalists' tactics belongs on 
the other side of your opinion page ("When the Pill Is Worse Than the Poison," 
Column Left, Dec. 4). He suggests the victims of pollution must develop 
alternatives to economic losses brought on by elimination of toxics in our 
water, food, soil and air. 
</P>
<P>
It would be far less difficult to match the funding spent by Big Toxics' 
campaigns against efforts to rein in the abuse to the planet. Further, not all 
labor unions are opposed to controls on industry's and state and federal 
agencies' pollution practices. Else why did Loathsome George find it necessary 
to gut Cal-OSHA and load the Farm Labor Board with big farmers?

RIGHT-TO-DIE CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Make Life Worth Living," by Bill Bolte (Commentary, Dec. 8): 
</P>
<P>
Bully for Bill! He has guts and spunk! He enjoys life, and I admire him 
tremendously. He is severely disabled and yet will not give up and makes a real 
life for himself; he makes the best of what he has and is happy doing it. But . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The message came across to me that he feels we should maintain the ethic of 
prolonging life at all costs. He implies that he believes society should 
intervene to prevent one from having life end when he or she personally feels 
the proper time has come. Bill may not have intended this message, but I 
certainly got it. In my opinion this point of view, which is widely held by 
many well-meaning sincere people, is cruel and intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
When the subject is young or depressed or in pain, then surely counseling, 
assistance and advice should be made available. However, there are many of us 
who advocate that ultimately an individual's personal decision should be 
respected when he or she wants to die. 
</P>
<P>
There are many who argue that "euthanasia" is what Hitler practiced on the 
Jews, his political enemies and also the aged and infirm. Therefore, we should 
have nothing to do with it. You can make any interpretation of a word that you 
like, but the right- to-die movement is not advocating Hitler's interpretation 
of the word. Neither Dr. Jack Kevorkian, nor his act of kindness to 
(Alzheimer's disease patient) Janet Adkins, is in the Hitler category. But Bill 
says he fears that people like Dr. Kevorkian, or even I, advocate legislation 
that might end up by executing people like himself. Bill, we are advocating the 
right to choose to die, not the right to choose to kill. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever your own convictions may be about our creation, you must surely agree 
that it did not originally include protracted dying in nursing homes and 
"modern" life-support in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
I am in excellent health and will be 75 in two months. But I am convinced that 
death is as natural as birth, and both should be helped when the patient is 
desirous of the help.

BILINGUAL EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How many languages does he suggest we teach in? Offhand, we have large 
populations of Latinos (of several countries), Vietnamese, Chinese, Armenians, 
Russians, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Where do we get the money for these bilingual programs since we are already in 
a severe budgetary crisis? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, how did the masses who immigrated here at the turn of the century get 
by? At that time we had many Polish, German, Yiddish, Italian-speaking people 
come to our shores. They managed to learn English and prosper without special 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
I think the answer may be in the fact that those turn-of-the-century immigrants 
were dedicated to becoming Americans and learning our language. Our newest 
immigrants' hearts and minds still live in the country they left instead of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Surely they can preserve their culture and still learn English so they can get 
an eduction.

RIGHT-TO-DIE CONTROVERSY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I believe that Bill Bolte, a middle-aged disabled person, is dreaming about 
dragons that do not exist in his fear that anybody will ever seek the 
elimination of disabled persons who do not want to die. The entire point of 
right-to-die advocates is individual freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
We have no desire to advise others. 
</P>
<P>
We do not believe that Dr. Kevorkian should be tried for developing his suicide 
machine and allowing Janet Adkins to use it. (A judge threw out the murder 
charge against Kevorkian on Dec. 13). Mrs. Adkins had made her own free 
decision, and we see no reason why anybody should question her decision, right 
or wrong. 
</P>
<P>
I am 86, and do not want to spend any time in a nursing home for any reason. If 
my disability gets to the point where I have to go to a hospital, all I want is 
pain-killer drugs and a quick death. I bitterly resent all opposition to that 
desire. To others, I only say, mind your own business and I will never try to 
advise you on anything.

EQUITY WATCH;

<P>
RIGHT CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Golf is a notoriously slow game. Sometimes it's so slow that while you're 
waiting to tee up, the season changes. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's why social change takes forever to come to the country clubs of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
In July, change dropped in on Shoal Creek Country Club like a summer squall. 
And by the time major advertisers had pulled out as sponsors of the PGA 
tournament there, the members of the all-white club must have felt as if they'd 
been hit by a hurricane. By August the club was making plans to admit its first 
black. 
</P>
<P>
Last month another storm hit a prestigious American country club. It was 
generated by genteel Tom Watson, one of America's preeminent golfers. He quit 
the ultra-restrictive Kansas City Country Club -- where as a youngster he first 
learned to play golf -- after it had rejected the application of the co-founder 
of H&amp;R Block, who is Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Kansas City Country Club changed its mind about Henry Block 
and so is about to admit its first Jewish member. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, a member for years, will never be mistaken for a civil-rights activist, 
but even for him enough is enough. "I would hope the club would sufficiently 
change so some good people of any religion, race or sex could become members," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He's right. America has had its fill of discrimination in country clubs and 
social clubs. But how many country clubs still refuse to face up to the reality 
of their discrimination? How many still will have to be clubbed by public 
embarrassment into doing the right thing?

CASTRO'S CUBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Castro Embattled," (Opinion, Dec. 9): 
</P>
<P>
Having read both Wayne Smith and Tad Szulc's column ("Reform: Change Is 
Overdue"), as well as Jean Edern-Hallier's copies of Fidel Castro's 1962 
letters to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, I'm left wondering how anyone in 
his right mind could conceive the notion that Castro -- the man who urged the 
Soviets to nuke the United States and was thus willing to annihilate Cuba in a 
nuclear confrontation for the sake of Communist dogma -- should be the same man 
entrusted to bring about political change on this embattled island. 
</P>
<P>
I also find it amusing how Castro's apologists (Smith and Szulc among them) are 
scrambling to cover their tracks by continuing to blame U.S. policy for 
Castro's sins and attempting to give this 63-year-old megalomaniac an easy way 
out of the socioeconomic abyss he himself dug for the Cuban people. 
</P>
<P>
As Lech Walesa, Poland's newly elected president, might say, the party is over, 
boys!

As a bilingual teacher, I applaud you for highlighting the importance of 
bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
As a third-grade teacher, working with the class of the year 2000, it seems 
appropriate to me that as we approach the 21st Century we see language not as a 
political issue, but as an opportunity to increase our understanding of the 
world around us. 
</P>
<P>
I advocate bilingual education, beginning in kindergarten, for all students.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
TIME TO BREAK THE DEADLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Things appear to be coming to a head on the selection of a site for a new jail 
in Orange County. It's about time. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the Board of Supervisors voted 3 to 2 to build a jail in 
Gypsum Canyon near Anaheim Hills. But the landowner, the Irvine Co., was 
unwilling to sell, and a fourth vote is needed to condemn the land. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the majority favoring the canyon site -- Harriett M. Wieder, Thomas F. 
Riley and Roger R. Stanton -- have signaled County Administrative Officer Ernie 
Schneider to begin negotiations with the Irvine Co. If talks don't move forward 
within 60 days, the supervisors say they will file suit to keep Anaheim from 
annexing the property in order to prevent construction of the jail. There may 
also be other legal strategies. 
</P>
<P>
It's fair to ask Wieder, Riley and Stanton why they haven't taken these actions 
before. By not moving forward, supervisors were off the hook, a political 
convenience that has kept the county from facing up to the even bigger problem 
of how a new jail would be financed. 
</P>
<P>
Several things have turned up the heat and put added pressure on Supervisors 
Don R. Roth and Gaddi H. Vasquez, who oppose the Gypsum Canyon site. First, a 
proposal by Roth to build the jail on a desert site in Riverside County was 
found to be far too costly. Also, prison expert Lawrence Grossman, who has long 
monitored the County Jail situation on behalf of U.S. District Judge William P. 
Gray, strongly backed the canyon site, and a grand jury urged the county to 
preserve its option of building there. 
</P>
<P>
The board also faces the prospect of another hearing before Gray, who will 
expect progress toward building a jail. At present, county jails house 4,400 
inmates in cells designed for 3,203. More than 50,000 people a year are either 
cited and released or released from jail early. Most are charged with minor 
crimes, but Sheriff Brad Gates says the community is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Only intense pressure has moved the supervisors off the dime. If it breaks the 
deadlock, good.

THEY HAVE TO CATCH RAIDERS NOW; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: L.A. CLINCHES FIRST PLAYOFF BERTH SINCE 1985 AND TAKES OVER FIRST 
PLACE WITH A 24-7 VICTORY OVER THE BENGALS. JACKSON MAKES THE BIG PLAY AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A backup cornerback without a shoe contract took Bo Jackson down from behind 
Sunday, turning hordes of fact-finders into part-time genealogists, but it 
wasn't enough to keep the Raiders from making quick work of the Cincinnati 
Bengals, 24-7, or re-introducing themselves to the playoffs for the first time 
since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
For the Raiders, commitment to excellence is reality again after four lost 
seasons, and the exclamation marking the end of their suffering was cause for 
celebration before 54,132 at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The news in Kansas City, where the Houston Oilers upended the Chiefs, made for 
some nice window dressing. The Raiders didn't merely clinch at least a 
wild-card berth with Sunday's victory, they jumped a full game ahead of Kansas 
City into first place in the AFC West with two games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great day for the organization, and it's a great day for this football 
team," Raider Coach Art Shell said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
It was, too, another great day for Jackson, who leads the league in 
news-per-carry. Sunday, it was an 88-yard, third-quarter display during which 
Jackson started left, changed direction, hurdled quarterback Jay Schroeder, and 
broke free down the right sideline, with only grass and air separating Jackson 
from the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed nothing without a motor would catch Jackson, but Bengal cornerback 
Rod Jones, subbing for the injured Lewis Billups, stalked Jackson stride for 
stride and tripped him up at the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why he didn't make it to the end zone," Shell said later. 
"I told him he must be losing a step." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's run led to a one-yard scoring pass from Schroeder to tight end Ethan 
Horton with 9:07 left in the quarter, putting the game out of reach at 24-7. 
The Raiders, in fact, mistakenly issued in the third quarter a news release 
about the purchasing of playoff tickets. It presumed a Raider victory. Turns 
out it wasn't that much of a reach. 
</P>
<P>
Bengal quarterback Boomer Esiason gave it the old college try with a bad groin. 
He threw a fluky touchdown pass to give his team a quick 7-0 lead, then faded 
from the scene. Esiason aggravated the injury on a 21-yard scramble in the 
second quarter and that was pretty much it. Esiason would be removed for good 
in the third quarter, as Coach Sam Wyche looked ahead to next week's AFC 
Central showdown against Houston, which could mean the division title. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm upset," Wyche said. "I don't like to lose. But next week is where it's 
at." 
</P>
<P>
So why not sit back and watch a Bo show? Everyone else was. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," Esiason said. "He's probably the world's greatest athlete. Our 
defense, I thought, did a whale of a job shutting him down. He just made a 
great play. He's just hard to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has proved to be quite mortal on most plays, but those 88-yarders tend 
to boost your average. Jackson gained 117 yards in eight carries against the 
Bengals. Last week in Detroit, it was 129 yards in 18 carries, which included a 
55-yard scoring run. The week before in Denver, it was 117 yards in 13 carries, 
but 62 of those came on one run for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
But what of the man who tracked down Bo Jackson? Actually, Jones entered the 
contest with all the right credentials for the task. A former first-round draft 
choice of Tampa Bay who didn't work out there, Jones was a track star at 
Southern Methodist University, winning the NCAA 400-meter championship in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Was it a fair race? Well, Jones had to leap the attempted block of Schroeder 
before giving chase of Jackson. Jones thought he had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, if I didn't think I could get him, I should have just stopped right 
then," Jones said later. "Bo is a fast man. You just have to be a fast man 
also." 
</P>
<P>
Jones said he and Jackson chatted briefly after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked did I run him down," Jones said. "I said I have to do my job, that's 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson seemed happy enough simply to extend one of his two-sport seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first playoffs ever in any sport," he said. "I'm anxious to see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders weren't thinking playoffs on the first drive, when Esiason drove 
the Bengals quickly down field and lofted a pass into the end zone that was 
intended for Eddie Brown. Brown didn't catch it. Instead, teammate Tim McGee 
stepped in front and completed a 41-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
You don't draw them up like that. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders tied the score late in the quarter on a five-yard scoring pass to 
the once-forgotten Tim Brown, capping a 27-yard drive that was made possible by 
linebacker Riki Ellison's interception of a deflected Esiason pass. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and Brown hooked up again in the second quarter on a 44-yard scoring 
play to put the Raiders ahead for good. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals threatened only once more, late in the half, but an Esiason pass 
into a crowded left corner of the end zone was intercepted by cornerback Terry 
McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jaeger added a 39-yard field goal with 45 seconds remaining to give the 
Raiders a 17-7 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals weren't much of a match, really. Esiason was injured. All-Pro left 
tackle Anthony Munoz was forced out of the game because of a shoulder sprain. 
Running back Ickey Woods didn't carry because of bad ribs, although he did 
catch a pass for two yards. Cincinnati started without corner Lewis Billups and 
safety Rickey Dixon because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Bengals pulled out the usual tricks. Twice, they lined Esiason out 
as a receiver, bad leg and all, using receiver Lynn James as a quarterback in a 
shotgun formation. 
</P>
<P>
Raider corner Lionel Washington followed Esiason to the flank, not sure what to 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
Giving up a big play to a one-legged quarterback playing receiver has its 
obvious drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"You look stupid," Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington didn't look stupid because Esiason didn't do anything other than act 
as a very expensive decoy. 
</P>
<P>
With the playoffs resolved, the Raiders can set their sights higher. Victories 
over Minnesota and San Diego in the next two weeks and the Raiders win the AFC 
West title. 
</P>
<P>
It's not enough being wild cards? 
</P>
<P>
"That's for the birds," defensive tackle Bob Golic said. "We're in control as 
long as we keep winning. There's nothing better than opening the paper and 
seeing 'Raiders' on top of the division chart." 
</P>
<P>
That, or watching Rod Jones chase Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
After going 20 quarters without a touchdown pass, the Raiders' Jay Schroeder 
now has thrown six in the past two weeks. Schroeder completed 10 of 20 passes 
against Cincinnati for 163 yards and no interceptions. Bengal quarterback 
Boomer Esiason completed seven of 17 passes for 134 yards before giving way to 
backup Erik Wilhelm with five minutes remaining in the third quarter. Esiason 
had one touchdown pass and threw two interceptions. . . . Remember Marcus 
Allen? He carried 14 times for 39 yards.

two games. C15.

<P>
Wanted: One brave soul in San Diego willing to fill entertainment void left by 
the Denver billboard sitter. 
</P>
<P>
Be advised: It might be next year before freedom can be assured. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (6-8), relying on the one-step-forward, two-steps-back formula 
that resulted in 6-10 finishes the past two seasons, were at it again Sunday in 
Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Add up the dropped passes, defensive lapses, penalties and botched scoring 
opportunities in the Chargers' 20-10 loss to the Broncos in front of 64,919 
fans, and has anything really changed? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it is a new day for Rich Goins, thank you, San Diego. For the first time 
in 34 days, he is on the ground to stay. The radio personality, who vowed to 
remain perched 40 feet up on a Denver billboard until the Broncos won, was 
unharnessed courtesy of the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who's happier, us or Rich Goins," Denver Coach Dan Reeves said 
after the Broncos snapped a six-game losing streak. "I know he's glad to be off 
that billboard, and it was a great win for us. It seemed like we had really 
forgotten what it feels like to win. It was so long ago." 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos' last victory was Oct. 21 in Indianapolis; their last victory at 
home had come Sept. 23 against Seattle. But against the Chargers, who were 
still counting playoff hopes on their Christmas wish list, Denver scored 17 
unanswered points to take a 17-3 lead early into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"You dominant them in yardage, time of possession, everything and come out of 
the half down 7-3," Charger linebacker Gary Plummer said. "That was the key." 
</P>
<P>
That was the ballgame. The Chargers had been in control. They had squandered a 
first-quarter scoring opportunity with tight end Derrick Walker's fumble at the 
goal line, but they had come back in the second quarter to post a 3-0 lead on 
John Carney's 30-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
With only 56 seconds left in the half, the Broncos' offense had run 16 plays 
and gained 62 yards against the Chargers' fourth-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
"And then we let them off the hook," cornerback Gill Byrd said, "and everything 
seemed to fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
In the final minute of the first half, quarterback John Elway moved the Broncos 
65 yards and into the end zone. On second and nine, Elway was forced from the 
pocket by an aggressive pass rush, and, while running to his left, threw to his 
right, between Sam Seale and Vencie Glenn and into the hands of Michael Young 
for the touchdown. Time left on the clock: 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave them the motivation they needed," Plummer said. "I think they were 
ready to quit. Unfortunately, we haven't realized as a team that we have to 
give the knockout punch when the opportunity presents itself. That's something 
a mature team, a team headed for the playoffs, can do." 
</P>
<P>
However, high expectations could turn into a third consecutive 6-10 campaign if 
form holds true down the stretch. The Chargers already have lost to the Chiefs 
and Raiders, their final two opponents, and Kansas City and Los Angeles remain 
playoff-motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"We better get ready to strap it on the next two weeks," Charger quarterback 
Billy Joe Tolliver said, "or we'll get the hell beat out of us." 
</P>
<P>
They had every chance Sunday, however, to defeat the Broncos, even their record 
and remain alive as a playoff longshot. But when Elway &amp; Co., came out in 
the third quarter and put another touchdown on the board for a 14-3 lead, the 
Chargers were finished. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Marion Butts, who gained 63 yards on 19 first-half carries, ran 
three times in the third quarter for eight yards and was never seen again. 
</P>
<P>
Forced to throw, Tolliver attempted a Dan Fouts-like 51 passes and completed a 
Babe Laufenberg-like 26. He was hurt again, however, by an undependable 
receiving corps that dropped six passes. 
</P>
<P>
"This was kind of a microcosm of the season; we had opportunities and didn't 
make them happen," Charger Coach Dan Henning said. "This points out to me that 
if you're not good enough to take advantage of the opportunities, you just have 
to get better. We have to do a better job of putting people out there to make 
the plays." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers placed themselves in position to grab the lead on their first 
possession. After moving to the Denver three on third and goal, Tolliver hit 
Walker with a short pass in the flats. 
</P>
<P>
Walker was hit by safety Steve Atwater, and tried to reach the ball across the 
goal line as he fell to the ground. The ball fell out of his hand, however, and 
Denver cornerback Randy Robbins recovered in the end zone and returned it to 
the Broncos' 22-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The first in what would become a series of instant replays throughout the day 
went against the Chargers as the officials ruled the play stood as called. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was down, but I can sit here and question it all day," Walker 
said. "The play stands." 
</P>
<P>
Down 7-3, the Chargers opened the third quarter with Donnie Elder muffing the 
kickoff. The Chargers were forced to go on the attack from their six-yard line, 
and after failing to gain a first down, put the Broncos back in good field 
possession at the Denver 43. 
</P>
<P>
Elway then took apart the Chargers' defense and finally hit Young again with a 
three-yard strike. 
</P>
<P>
"John Elway was the difference," Charger linebacker Leslie O'Neal said. "He 
started to get his confidence near the end of the first half when he scrambled 
and threw that touchdown pass. In the second half, he was a totally different 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Elway put the Broncos in position again in the fourth quarter to set up David 
Treadwell's 49-yard field goal -- the longest of his career -- for a 17-3 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers retaliated with their only touchdown drive of the day as Tolliver 
marched his team 80 yards in seven plays. He brought the Chargers within a 
touchdown of the Broncos with a well-aimed 22-yard shot to H-back Craig McEwen, 
but how fast can you say, "Elway?" 
</P>
<P>
On the Broncos' first play from scrimmage after accepting the kickoff, Elway 
found a wide-open Melvin Bratton, and the 225-pound running back chugged 63 
yards before being dragged down. A few moments later, Treadwell came on to the 
end the game's scoring with a 26-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say this win saves the whole year," Elway said after completing 18 of 
29 for 248 yards. "We won today, but we are still disappointed with how the 
season has gone." 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes for the Chargers. They were playing a team that had lost six 
games in a row, a team that lost defensive starters Steve Atwater (rib 
cartilage separation) and Simon Fletcher (ankle sprain) during the game and a 
team they already beat 19-7 earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chargers self-destructed. Tolliver had Quinn Early deep for a touchdown 
in the first half and overthrew him. He had Anthony Miller wide open for a 
79-yard touchdown, and Miller dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I just dropped it," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Bratton went 63 yards because linebacker Junior Seau was caught out of 
position. And in the fourth quarter, a Tolliver pass for Miller was intercepted 
by Le-Lo Lang in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not rock bottom," O'Neal said. "We're still 6-8 and still have a chance 
to be 8-8. We can't give up the ship. Sooner or later we're going to start 
winning the games like this, but until that time, then you have to be 
frustrated."

NFC: FORMER USC STAR HAS CAREER HIGHS OF 316 PASSING YARDS AND FOUR TOUCHDOWNS 
IN 38-21 VICTORY OVER BEARS.

There are two things Rodney Peete has to do to keep the Detroit Lions' 
high-tech offense humming: Avoid injuries and stay out of the coach's doghouse. 
</P>
<P>
When Peete is clicking, as he was Sunday night, the Lions are a different team. 
</P>
<P>
Peete had career highs of 316 passing yards and four touchdowns as the Lions 
beat Chicago, 38-21, putting a serious dent in the Bears' chances for a 
first-round bye in the NFL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears (10-4) lost their second straight to fall a game behind the New York 
Giants (11-3) in the NFC. Chicago would need to win both remaining games while 
the Giants lose both of theirs to avoid playing a wild-card team in the first 
round of playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"That was pretty tough on us," Chicago Coach Mike Ditka said. "I can't dwell on 
that. I've got to dwell on what's ahead of us. But, boy, I'll tell you, it 
hurts. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts you, it hurts me and it hurts them (the players)." 
</P>
<P>
Peete, the former USC star who was a sixth-round draft choice in 1989, 
completed 18 of 27 passes with two interceptions as the Lions (5-9) avenged a 
23-17 overtime loss at Chicago's Soldier Field two weeks ago. In that game, 
Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes yanked Peete in the third quarter in favor of backup 
Bob Gagliano. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been pretty frustrating because I've been hurt a lot this season," Peete 
said. "The only way to really get better is to be in there week after week. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, I was able to see some things correctly and hit the right guys at the 
right time. Hopefully, this game will be a big part of my improvement." 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Peete threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Robert Clark, a 
44-yarder to Richard Johnson and a one-yarder to Clark as the Lions overcame a 
7-0 deficit to take a 21-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Rodney Peete has confidence," Fontes said. "He's only played about 17 
games in his two years. I've said all along that when he's healthy, Rodney 
Peete's my quarterback -- at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Peete hooked up with Terry Greer on a 68-yard scoring play in the third 
quarter, Barry Sanders had a one-yard touchdown run in the fourth and Eddie 
Murray, who became the first player in Lion history to score 1,000 points, 
kicked a 26-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
For the Bears, Brad Muster had a one-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, 
Richard Dent returned a third-quarter fumble 45 yards for a touchdown and Peter 
Tom Willis tossed an eight-yard touchdown pass to Wendell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll put tonight behind us," Ditka said. "I can't dwell on the past. I can 
just dwell on the future." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Harbaugh completed only four of 11 passes for 28 yards for Chicago before 
going out with a dislocated right shoulder on his fourth sack with 6:09 left in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' defense, last overall in the NFL, held the Bears to 225 yards while 
Detroit was rolling up 411 yards against Chicago's normally tough defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears' Neal Anderson rushed for 100 yards in 22 carries, giving him 1,010 
for the season -- his third consecutive 1,000-yard rushing season. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago rookie Mark Carrier, another former Trojan, had his ninth interception, 
tying a club record set by Roosevelt Taylor in 1963. Carrier leads the NFC in 
interceptions.

COWBOYS STAY IN PLAYOFF RACE WITH 41-10 WIN; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: SMITH TIES TEAM-RECORD WITH FOUR RUSHING TOUCHDOWNS AGAINST CARDINALS AS 
DALLAS WINS FOUR CONSECUTIVE GAMES FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1985.

<P>
The Dallas Cowboys continue their transformation from the NFL's worst team to 
respectability. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Emmitt Smith kept the Cowboys' wild-card playoff hopes alive by rushing 
for four touchdowns Sunday in a 41-10 victory over the Phoenix Cardinals. If 
the Cowboys can win their last two games against Philadelphia and Atlanta, they 
can reach the playoffs for the first time since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done better than I ever imagined," said Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson, 
whose team was 1-15 last season. "We knew we had to win this game and the team 
responded." 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys moved into the best position for the remaining NFC wild-card birth. 
Washington and Philadelphia have clinched NFC wild cards and Dallas' 7-7 record 
puts it a full game ahead of Green Bay, Minnesota, Tampa Bay and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our most important victory by far," Johnson said. "Now we are in a 
position to make the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys have won four consecutive games for the first time since 1985. With 
Kansas City's 27-10 loss to Houston, Dallas has the NFL's longest winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals, 5-9 after losing for the first time in four games, hadn't lost 
to the Cowboys since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cowboys are vastly improved," Cardinal Coach Joe Bugel said. "Emmitt Smith 
is just tremendous. When you've got a good quarterback like Troy Aikman and a 
good running back, you've got a chance to win every time you play. I have 
nothing but praise for them." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a first-round draft choice from Florida who missed all of training camp 
in a contract holdout, gained 103 yards in 24 carries and scored on runs of 
one, 11, one and six yards. The last touchdown came after he slipped and fell, 
then got up and regained his footing while the Cardinals (5-9) stood around 
watching. 
</P>
<P>
"On that last touchdown run I reminded myself I wasn't in college anymore," 
Smith said. "This isn't college ball." 
</P>
<P>
Smith tied the team record of four rushing touchdowns set by Calvin Hill in 
1971 against Buffalo. Dan Reeves, Bob Hayes, and Duane Thomas also have scored 
four touchdowns in a game for the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
"The record means a lot and I guess I've surprised myself this year," said 
Smith, who has gained 842 yards. "But I really expect to perform like this 
every week." 
</P>
<P>
Smith is only one rushing touchdown short of the Dallas rookie record of 12 set 
by Tony Dorsett. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys, avenging a 20-3 loss to the Cardinals on Oct. 14, built a 13-3 
first-quarter lead on two touchdown runs by Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Al Del Greco gave the Cardinals a 3-0 lead with a 38-yard field goal before the 
Cowboys drove 75 yards with Smith scoring from a yard out. 
</P>
<P>
James Washington recovered a fumble by Johnny Johnson at the Phoenix 33, 
positioning Dallas for Smith's 11-yard scoring run that made it 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman and Michael Irvin connected on a 39-yard pass play in the second quarter 
to set up an eight-yard scoring pass that Irvin caught after outjumping 
defensive back Cedric Mack in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Smith scored twice in the second half, the second touchdown coming after 
Washington intercepted a pass by Timm Rosenbach. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who gained 22 yards in 13 carries, scored the only Phoenix touchdown 
on a one-yard run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't our day," said Rosenbach, who completed 14 of 35 passes for 151 
yards. "We had a good early drive, but after that nothing seemed to work." 
</P>
<P>
Aikman completed 12 of 18 passes for 164 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin caught four passes for 91 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, the Cowboys travel to Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia to play the 
Eagles.

AFC: MIAMI BEATS SEAHAWKS, 24-17, IN TUNEUP FOR NEXT WEEKEND'S GAME AGAINST 
FIRST-PLACE BUFFALO.

The Miami Dolphins capitalized on big plays and dodged four scoring threats in 
the second half Sunday for a 24-17 victory over the Seattle Seahawks that 
magnified the importance of next weekend's game at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Miami (11-3) is one game behind the first-place Bills in the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a pretty good team," said Dolphin quarterback Dan Marino, who completed 
17 of 29 passes for 250 yards and two touchdowns against the Seahawks. "I won't 
say we're a great team, but we're pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
"The big test for us will be next week. If we can win there, we can go as far 
as we want to go." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins, who have the second-best record in the AFC, clinched at least a 
wild-card playoff berth a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
If the Dolphins win next Sunday and beat Indianapolis in their final 
regular-season game Dec. 30, they'll be the division champions. If the Dolphins 
lose to Buffalo, they'll be eliminated from title contention. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks (7-7) might be able to land a wild-card berth just by splitting 
their final games at home against Denver and Detroit. But the loss did 
considerable damage to the Seahawks' chances. 
</P>
<P>
"This was like our playoff game because we could decide our own fate," 
linebacker David Wyman said. "We thought we could beat these guys. Now we're 
going to have to win our last two games and rely on some other teams to help us 
out to get in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Miami scored its first two touchdowns in the second quarter on a four-yard pass 
play from Marino to James Pruitt and a six-yard run by Troy Stradford. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins' final score, late in the third quarter, came on a fourth-and-one 
pass play from Marino to Ferrell Edmunds that covered 11 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks had won four of their past five games by coming up with a big play 
in the final minute, but there were no late-game heroics against the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had the attitude to keep them out of the end zone," Miami cornerback 
Tim McKyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks reached the Dolphins' 30-yard line five times in the second half 
but scored only on their final possession. 
</P>
<P>
Two drives ended when kicker Norm Johnson hit the left upright with a 34-yard 
field-goal attempt, then hit the right upright with a 37-yard attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably couldn't do that again if I wanted to," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter threats were snuffed when McKyer and John Offerdahl intercepted 
passes by Dave Krieg. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good effort, just wasted," said Krieg, who completed 21 of 37 passes 
for 295 yards and one touchdown. "It was disappointing and frustrating to lose 
to these guys, because we had plenty of opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
After Seattle scored on a 13-yard pass play from Krieg to Jeff Chadwick with 
1:51 left, Miami recovered the ensuing onside kick and then left the Seahawks 
time for only one desperation pass, which was intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins, who had allowed an average of 191 yards rushing the past four 
games, limited Seattle to 83. 
</P>
<P>
"The big plays are noticed more," Offerdahl said. "But our run defense was 
solid today."

BUCCANEERS WIN UNDER NEW COACH, 26-13;

NFC: TESTAVERDE RUNS FOR 105 YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN TO LEAD TAMPA BAY OVER

<TEXT>
<P>
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers didn't spend a lot of time moping around when Ray 
Perkins was fired as coach. They got ready for the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of an extra week of preparation and the relaxed atmosphere 
created by interim coach Richard Williamson, the Buccaneers stunned the 
Vikings, 26-13, Sunday and stayed alive in the playoff picture with their first 
sweep of a season series with an NFC Central Division rival. 
</P>
<P>
Vinny Testaverde, criticized at times for his reluctance to run out of the 
pocket, scrambled for 105 yards and one touchdown in seven carries before a 
crowd of 47,272 that watched Williamson's debut end with a Gatorade drenching 
led by the Buccaneers' quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"He prepared us well," Testaverde said. "He gave us a positive attitude and 
positive outlook on everything. One of the things he told us was go out and 
have a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been as loose and relaxed as I've ever seen it since I've been here," the 
fourth-year quarterback said. "I think that's a big part in why we won." 
</P>
<P>
Testaverde scored on a 48-yard run in the first quarter and threw a 25-yard 
touchdown pass to Mark Carrier for a 23-0 halftime lead. He also set up three 
of Steve Christie's four field goals as the Buccaneers (6-8) took advantage of 
eight Minnesota turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the second in a row for Tampa Bay (6-8), which stopped a 
six-game losing streak two weeks ago but couldn't save Perkins' job. Williamson 
replaced him on Dec. 3 and had extra time to prepare for Minnesota because of 
Tampa Bay's open date last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings (6-8) lost for the ninth consecutive time outdoors and face an 
uphill battle to claim the wild-card playoff spot that a five-game winning 
streak left them in a position to chase. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Vikings' eight turnovers were two fumbles that stopped scoring 
threats. And an interception by the Buccaneers' Rodney Rice set up a first-half 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Viking quarterback Rich Gannon was benched after completing only two of seven 
passes for eight yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Wilson, playing for the first time since suffering a thumb injury in Week 
3, then threw for 374 yards, including 75 on a scoring pass play to Hassan 
Jones.

BELFOUR MAKES HIMSELF AND BLACKHAWKS NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Belfour is proof that training camp can be important. 
</P>
<P>
When the Chicago Blackhawks began preseason preparations, the former North 
Dakota University goaltender was No. 7 on the list of goalies. By the time the 
season began, Belfour had moved to No. 1 for the defending Norris Division 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
The weak spot of the Blackhawks last season was their defense. Largely because 
of Belfour, it has become the strongest. 
</P>
<P>
Belfour turned aside 32 shots Sunday at Chicago in the Blackhawks' 5-2 victory 
over the Minnesota North Stars to become the first goalie to win 21 games in 
the NHL this season. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Roenick provided the offense, getting a hat trick. Two of the goals came 
when the Blackhawks scored three power-play goals in 4:29 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Keenan credits Belfour for the Blackhawks having the best record in 
the NHL -- 23-11-2. 
</P>
<P>
"This team has united behind Belfour," he said. "And the crowd responds for him 
at home." 
</P>
<P>
Belfour, 25, played in only 33 NHL games previously, nine of them last spring 
in the playoffs. There was no indication he would become the inspirational 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I have 21 victories," Belfour said, "but it's mainly because the players in 
front of me have had a tremendous season. I'm lucky to have them." 
</P>
<P>
Roenick, a second-year center from Boston, scored into an empty net for his 
third hat trick and 17th goal. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 5, Vancouver 2 -- The Flames' special teams these days are just that -- 
special. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Nieuwendyk and Al MacInnis scored power-play goals less than a minute apart 
in the first period at Vancouver and the Flames extended their unbeaten string 
to 6-0-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames, who lead the league with 43 power-play goals, stretched their lead 
over the Kings in the Smythe Division to five points. 
</P>
<P>
MacInnis, a defenseman, scored on another power play in the last period and has 
10 this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames, among the leaders in penalty killing, also scored a short-handed 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 5, Buffalo 3 -- Brett Hull scored twice at Buffalo and the Blues kept 
pace with Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues, tied with Calgary for the second-best record, trail the Blackhawks 
by four points. 
</P>
<P>
Hull's league-leading 33rd goal broke a 3-3 tie in the second minute of the 
third period. Hull is averaging a goal per game. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, Detroit 1 -- Former King defenseman Larry Murphy, recently traded 
again, scored his first goal for the Penguins in this game at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Barrasso, getting only his third start in the last 12 games, stopped 40 
shots as the Penguins won their third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Mullen, Bryan Trottier and Paul Coffey scored within seven minutes in the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Rick Tocchet scored what proved to be the 
game-winner in the second period at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers outshot the Red Wings, 39-21. DAN HAFNER

TIMES GET FASTER AFTER HER HEART SLOWS

<P>
It would strike at any time -- the middle of the night, the beginning of 
practice, en route to class on the USC campus. Without warning, Megan 
Holliday's heart would begin to race, up to 170 beats a minute. 
</P>
<P>
The freshman distance freestyle swimmer from London, Ontario, was born with 
Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, and has an extra muscle fiber connected to the 
upper and lower chambers of the heart that conducts impulses. When the 
pea-sized extra fiber was functioning, it forced Holliday's heart to beat too 
rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Holliday noticed the symptoms when she was 11. The rapid heartbeats lasted from 
several minutes to more than an hour, although months would pass without an 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
Her doctor told her it was only a nuisance that she might grow out of, but 
after Loyola Marymount basketball star Hank Gathers collapsed and died of a 
heart condition last spring, Holliday's mother, Susan, ordered more tests for 
her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The tests revealed that Megan is in a high-risk group and could suffer a heart 
attack at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in shock," Holliday said. "I thought all along it wasn't a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
She was given three options: medication, a catheter ablation procedure or open 
heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Holliday decided on the catheter ablation procedure, which would destroy the 
superfluous tissue, because it would not require a lengthy recovery. On Aug. 
20, a Canadian doctor performed the operation, but he was inexperienced with 
the technique and it failed. 
</P>
<P>
Upon her arrival in Southern California, Holliday tried medication, but it 
backfired. 
</P>
<P>
"I had attacks more often and I was dizzy so the university pulled me out of 
the water," said Holliday, who had 12 episodes in four days. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom frantically called around to find a doctor who could do the catheter 
ablation procedure. We found one in Oklahoma City who had a cancellation, and I 
went on two days' notice." 
</P>
<P>
In a 14-hour procedure, the surgeon, Warren Jackman, positioned a small metal 
electrode into the heart via a catheter. Using a high-frequency electrical 
current, he destroyed the extra fiber. Five days later, Holliday was back in 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really thought about it as my life being in danger," she said. "The 
funny thing is, I only worried about not being able to swim. Everyone else 
worried about my health." 
</P>
<P>
Although the procedure was apparently successful, there remains cause for 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I still get it going too fast, but after a couple of beats it stops," Holliday 
said. "I talked to my doctor (in Los Angeles). He said because I'm tuned to my 
heart so well I'm going to be on the alert for anything abnormal." 
</P>
<P>
During Christmas vacation or spring break, Holliday will be retested. Her heart 
will be stimulated to race to make sure the fiber has not grown back. There is 
an 8% recurrence rate, but according to Jackman, there is no recurrence after a 
second procedure. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Holliday is concentrating on swimming. 
</P>
<P>
As a 15-year-old, she won two bronze medals for Canada in the 1987 Pan American 
Games, but since 1989 she had leveled off -- until last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Even after missing a month of practice, she improved her time by 45 seconds in 
the 1,650-yard freestyle in the U.S. National Grand Prix meet at Belmont Plaza 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Cal's Sarah Anderson swam a meet-record 16 minutes 22.82 seconds in winning the 
1,650 freestyle Sunday in the Grand Prix meet. Anderson also won the 500 
freestyle handily at 4:46.32, and the third-ranked Bears won in the women's 
division, beating USC, which is ranked fifth nationally, 1,249.5 to 948.5. 
</P>
<P>
Cal and USC split the four relays, thanks to a strong finish by Cal's Amy 
Tidball in the last event of the meet, the 400 freestyle relay. Tidball was 
caught by Trojan anchor Lisa Dorman at the final turn, but Tidball inched ahead 
in the last 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I just held my breath and it really speeded me up," Tidball said. 
</P>
<P>
All was not lost by Dorman, however. She won the 100 freestyle in 50.87 and set 
a school record in the 50 with a 23.18. 
</P>
<P>
On the men's side, Arizona State beat USC, 1,111 to 1,022.5. The Trojans were 
without five of their top swimmers. Four were benched by Coach Peter Daland for 
missing practice and Olympian Dave Wharton, preparing for the World 
Championships, swam only in the relays. 
</P>
<P>
The individual highlight on the men's side was Glenn Peoples' 1:59.70 in the 
200 breaststroke. The time would have placed him 15th in last season's NCCA 
meet, a promising effort so early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans had a sore throat and finished fifth in the 400 individual medley 
and seventh in the 200 freestyle at the U.S. Open in Indianapolis Nov. 30-Dec. 
1. . . . In the 100 butterfly, Santa Barbara's Brian Alderman upset 1988 
Olympic gold medalist Anthony Nesty of Surinam and Canada's Marcel Gery, who is 
ranked No. 2 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia's Natalie Norberg has come a long way since the U.S. Swimming senior 
nationals in August, in which she finished 44th in the 200 freestyle in 
2:06.46. At the U.S. Open, the 16-year-old from the Industry Hills team won the 
silver medal in 2:02.83. . . . Texas sophomore Erika Hansen will not be able to 
compete in the World Championships because of a virus. Longhorn teammate Katy 
Arris will replace her in the 400 freestyle and Julie Kole, who recently made 
an unwritten commitment to attend Stanford next year, will swim the 800 
freestyle in her place. 
</P>
<P>
Succeeding James (Doc) Councilman is like trying to replace John Wooden, Bear 
Bryant, or Woody Hayes. It hasn't been done successfully by the initial 
successor. No wonder the going is rough for Indiana's new coach, Kris Kirchner. 
For the first time since 1956, the Hoosiers lost a dual meet to Purdue. . . . 
Matt Biondi, Tom Jager and Eric Hansen competed in Flagstaff, Ariz., last 
Saturday in two heats of the 50-meter freestyle before 325 at the Northern 
Arizona Natatorium. Organizers hoped for a world record, but the fastest time 
was Hansen's 23.08, well off Jager's world-record 21.81. 
</P>
<P>
COMING MEETS -- International: World Aquatic Championships, Jan. 3-13, in 
Perth, Australia, includes diving, water polo and synchronized swimming. Swim 
dates are Jan. 6-13 and include first time long-distance (25 kilometers) race 
in the Swan River. NCAA, Men: UC Irvine Invitational, Jan. 5-6; Men and Women: 
UC Santa Barbara Invitational, Jan. 3-5; Arizona State Invitational, Jan. 
10-13.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS: ROSS TO GET ANOTHER CHANCE WITH 39'S 
NEW 4:30 SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KNSD-TV(Channel 39) has hired former KFMB-TV(Channel 8) anchorwoman Allison 
Ross to host a new 4:30 p.m. weekday news show expected to debut in March. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the station is negotiating with KSDO-AM (1130) talk show host 
Roger Hedgecock, the former mayor of San Diego, to play a major role in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited," Ross said Friday. "I'm glad to be given another opportunity in 
San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The concept of a 4:30 p.m. news show makes sense for Channel 39, which has been 
struggling to find an adequate lead-in for its 5 p.m. news. Arbitron ratings 
released last week for the November sweeps period showed the syndicated program 
"Personalities" earning a meager 1 rating and 3 share at 4:30 p.m. Channel 8 is 
the only other local station with a news show at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be a typical co-anchor format," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Ross has not been inactive in television since she left Channel 8 in June, 
1989. Through her 12 years at the station, she became one of the most popular 
news readers in town. But she eventually fell into disfavor at the station and 
her contract was not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Since leaving Channel 8, Ross attracted attention because she gave interviews 
discussing her bouts with depression. Earlier this year, she gave birth to a 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had a chance to say good-by, but now I have a chance to say hello," 
Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
While Ross is looking forward to a new job, Channel 8 is still struggling to 
find a winning combination in the post-Ross era. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 8 anchorman Stan Miller has agreed to a new deal with the station, but 
that doesn't mean his future is in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to work in an environment where you feel you've done your best for 4 
1/2 years and then all of a sudden, without warning, they pull the rug out from 
under you," Miller said in a phone interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly looking for something to spark the news show out of a ratings rut, 
management has decided to move Miller from the main 5 p.m. newscast to the 6:30 
p.m. show. In turn, 6:30 p.m. anchor Hal Clement, who has been at Channel 8 for 
8,000 years, will take over the 5 p.m. show. 
</P>
<P>
One problem: Miller's contract, which would have expired in May, specifically 
called for him to anchor the main 5 p.m. newscast. By deciding to make the move 
now instead of waiting until May, management was forced to renegotiate with 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The new deal is for only one year and includes a provision that he can leave at 
any time if he gets a job in one of the country's five largest television 
markets. Miller said he is already exploring that option. 
</P>
<P>
Although he said the station has told him that the move is not a demotion, he 
took it as such. He said the station never warned him that management was 
unhappy with his work until he walked in on Election Night to learn that 
Clement was to take the lead role in that evening's telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
"They've killed my morale," Miller said. "I'll continue to do the best I can, 
but I took it as definite vote of no confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he expects Clement to do a good job and wished him the best, but 
made clear that he believes the station made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're clutching at straws," Miller said. "Personally, I don't think 
I was the problem." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the future of Miller's 5 p.m. partner is also in doubt. For 
several months, Channel 8 has been advertising for an anchor, reportedly to 
replace Susan Roesgen, Ross's replacement, who is widely believed to be on her 
way out. 
</P>
<P>
Former KCBQ owner and general manager Simon T is back in his La Jolla home, 
relaxing after his sudden departure from the general manager job at KQLZ 
(Pirate Radio). For the first time, Simon publicly acknowledged that his 
departure was the result of a difference of opinion with program director/star 
morning guy Scott Shannon. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Simon said he wanted to move the hard rock station 
toward a more contemporary hits format, a move Shannon resisted. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew that if I ever had a difference of opinion with the program 
director, if he and I ever got into it, I knew I would potentially be on the 
short end of the stick," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
Simon said the parting was amicable. Although he has been entertaining offers, 
he plans to take a year off. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest challenge now is to remember not to dial 9 on my phone," Simon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Irv Kass has decided to accept the Channel 39 news director job, replacing his 
longtime friend and mentor Don Shafer, who was forced to resign two weeks ago. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
KSDO staff members are calling it "bloody Monday." Management is calling it a 
"restructuring." No one was laid off, according to general manager Mike 
Shields, but several staff members have either left the station or found their 
jobs reorganized. "When we restructured, we gave people options," Shields said. 
"It was up to them to take them or not. Everybody was given a place to work." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KSDO is attempting to negotiate a new deal with Michael Reagan, 
whose contract expires next month. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Add to the annals of awkward television moments last Thursday night's exchange 
between Channel 10 sports guy Larry Sacknoff and anchorwoman Kimberly Hunt. 
Sacknoff led his sports segment with a reference to Charger Leslie O'Neal's 
accusations that an unidentified teammate was getting unwarranted publicity. 
Sacknoff pointed out that most people thought the unidentified player was Billy 
Ray Smith, a.k.a. Mr. Kimberly Hunt. He continually turned to Hunt, trying to 
provoke a reaction. She just stared at him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar-based Frontline Video is producing "Powder Magazine," a skiing program 
which debuts on ESPN at 10:30 p.m., Thursday. It is a sister to Frontline's 
"Surfer Magazine." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39 gave the U.S. Marines $10,000 for its "Toys for Tots" program, 
believed to be the largest single contribution ever made to the San Diego 
program. The money was raised last month in a promotion that aired during 
"Wheel of Fortune."

Diceman Steamed: Andrew Dice Clay is upset with 20th Century Fox for deciding 
to permanently shelve his in-concert feature film, "Dice Rules." 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing stinks, it's just a load of crap," he said. The film, 
originally slated for release last fall, "could have been a cool Christmas 
present for my fans," he said, "to see the Diceman up there on the screen, 
40-feet tall. I completely trusted the people at Fox, put my entire career in 
their hands, which turned out to be my mistake." CLAUDIA PUIG

Molly's Back: New episodes of the on-again, off-again series "The Days and 
Nights of Molly Dodd" return to the Lifetime cable network Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The final 13 episodes of the series, which ran for two seasons on NBC and has 
now been on Lifetime for two years, will air Saturdays at 10:30 p.m. When we 
last saw Molly, played by Blair Brown, she was about to reveal who fathered her 
child. Lifetime had previously announced that it would not produce any new 
episodes of the series. "Two years is about all any network can stand us," 
Brown said. CLAUDIA PUIG

On the Right Track: Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Jason Miller, who was 
arrested in October for being disorderly on board a plane flight, says he's 
getting back on track by completing an alcohol rehabilitation program. Miller 
issued a statement in connection with being fined last week after he and a 
companion pleaded guilty to public intoxication and disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Miller resulted from an Oct. 22 incident when he was flying 
from South Bend, Ind., to his home in Scranton after attending the Miami-Notre 
Dame football game. Miller, 51, said both men are sorry. "This incident made me 
realize that I had a problem and I have taken steps to get back on the right 
track," Miller said. He is scheduled to begin rehearsals Jan. 2 for a Los 
Angeles production of "Inherit the Wind," in which he will play Clarence 
Darrow. CLAUDIA PUIG

COUNTERPUNCH: COMEDY CHANNEL OR HA!: WHICH HAS THE LAST LAUGH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH OLBERMANN, Olbermann is sports director at KCBS Channel 2, host of The 
Keith Olbermann Show, and sports commentator on KNX Radio. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I curled up in the big black chair trying to memorize the back of my 
parents' "The 2000 Year Old Man" album, I distinctly remember, my feet not only 
didn't touch the floor, they didn't even reach the edge. I sat in on a Bob and 
Ray radio program at 15, got through trig in school only by re-enacting the 
previous episode of Monty Python for an early-to-bed teacher and I'll still 
come back from a visit to my folks with another one of their old Jonathan 
Winters albums, which I've stolen while they weren't looking. 
</P>
<P>
I think, therefore, that I am a comedy connoisseur, and it's as a comedy 
connoisseur that I insist -- contrary to Rick Du Brow's implication to the 
contrary in his Nov. 27 and Dec. 11 columns -- that the Comedy Channel may be 
the greatest resource for humor in the history of mass media. 
</P>
<P>
The Comedy Channel, launched by HBO in November of '89, is invariably confused 
with Ha!, a repeat-choked outfit that MTV unleashed about two months later. A 
few cable systems have both, most have neither, many have one. Unfortunately, 
since Ha! also calls itself "The TV Comedy Network," many viewers of one think 
they are watching the other. 
</P>
<P>
This is especially depressing to those of us who are unabashed fans of the 
almost anti-television television of "Night After Night With Allan Havey," or 
of the wisecracking strangeness of the almost indescribable "Mystery Science 
Theatre 3000." While these Comedy Channel shows occasionally fall into the pits 
of all humor ("I don't like it. I don't get it. Who is that? What else is 
on?"), they are, at worst, fresh and new and original. 
</P>
<P>
At the same moment that "Mystery Science Theatre 3000" host Joel Hodgson and 
two robots manage to transform horrible films like "Catalina Caper" into 
vehicles or incisive jokes about the savings and loan scandals or "I've fallen 
and I can't get up," Ha! is airing "CPO Sharkey" reruns. 
</P>
<P>
While on "Night After Night," the mock-cranky Havey is being challenged by a 
mildly hostile stage crew to improvise his way out of a dubious routine, or 
inviting a 14-year-old fan onto the show only to compel him to first fire, then 
strangle, the program's assistant producer, Ha! is giving us reruns of a 
canceled Tim Conway show that Tim Conway probably doesn't even remember, called 
"Ace Crawford, Private Eye." 
</P>
<P>
This is not to imply that the Comedy Channel is one long experimental comedy 
workshop while Ha! merely runs everything Nick at Nite wouldn't touch. Of late, 
Ha! has made moves toward retiring "Candid Camera" by inserting original 
material into its line-up, shows like "Random Acts of Variety" and a superior 
British import called "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the Comedy Channel has recently redoubled its vintage offerings. 
While Ha! has been rightly praised for running the priceless Sid Caesar 
routines, the Comedy Channel has been showing extraordinary kinescopes of the 
Bob and Ray NBC-TV series of the early '50s, and will be adding both Monty 
Python and Ernie Kovacs in January. Edie Adams not only gave the channel her 
late husband's masterworks; she presented a reverentially hushed Havey with two 
of the original masks from Kovacs' Nairobi Trio. 
</P>
<P>
The comedy connoisseur is also offered a new Alan King interview series, 
"Inside the Comedy Mind," and Rich Hall checks in with an almost eerie, 
environmentally oriented half-hour called "Onion World." The comedy trio The 
Higgins Boys &amp; Gruber spends 90 minutes deftly re-creating the experience 
of sitting in your neighbor's basement when the bunch of you were 10 or 11 or 
maybe 33. Havey's sidekick, Nick Bakay, also anchors with Joe Bolster and Jon 
Hayman a deliciously vicious parody of sportscasts (including mine), adroitly 
called "Sports Monster." 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, two Comedy Channel shows should already be at the forefront 
of TV entertainment, if only there were enough people out there to watch them. 
</P>
<P>
It is nearly impossible to explain "Mystery Science Theatre 3000" to those who 
have not seen it. The premise is ludicrous -- a maintenance man in a science 
laboratory (Oicmonics Institute) is shot into space by two evil scientists who 
don't like him very much. He dismantles part of his ship-cum-prison to build a 
series of robots, and the lot of them are subjected to cruel experiments by the 
earth-bound lunatics. The cruel experiments? Being forced to sit through the 
worst movies imaginable, which the viewer watches with them, as if sitting 
behind them in a darkened theater. 
</P>
<P>
Wrapped in the guise of a kids' show (Hodgson -- the human -- regularly reads 
mail from youngsters who send him drawings of the robots), "MST 3000" contains 
some of the hippest, deepest satire of the generation. 
</P>
<P>
The other stars-in-hiding populate the nervous world of "Night After Night," a 
nightly talk show without many guests, but with the soon-to-be comic 
heavy-hitters Havey and Bakay, plus an impromptu ensemble cast Havey has 
created out of the show's staff, cameramen and even security guards. "Night 
After Night" is an all-you-can-eat salad bar of humor, wherein some of the 
lettuce is a little brown and the potato salad looks like somebody's walked 
through it, but still you can dine every night with variety and come away 
stuffed to the point of explosion. 
</P>
<P>
With the networks strangling in sitcoms, the fundamental collision of these two 
cable channels is the improvisational tomorrow versus the canned-laughter 
yesterday. If they were to merge, as rumor has suggested for a year, certainly 
many of Ha!'s better features (Sid Caesar again, perhaps "Car 54") could still 
find a home, but for the connoisseur's money, the hybrid would have to look a 
lot like the Comedy Channel of the current moment. 
</P>
<P>
"Love, American Style" and "Mork and Mindy" better than "Mystery Science 
Theater 3000" and "Shag and Bag"? Ha!

SKINNY PUPPY OFFERS ALIENATING SPECTACLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Skinny Puppy, an uncommonly popular death-disco band from Vancouver, plays 
dance music that nobody dances to and bellows gloomy manifestoes that no one 
understands. All beat, light and nightmarish distortion, a Skinny Puppy concert 
can be one of the most profoundly alienating spectacles in rock. Friday's show 
at the Palladium felt like a brutal slasher-movie killing drawn out to the 
point of insensateness. 
</P>
<P>
On the backlit, fog-enshrouded stage, mask-wearing vocalist Nivek Ogre moaned, 
whirled a flail over his head, cringed from the proscenium as if he were 
starring in a particularly claustrophobic Beckett play. The drummer thrashed 
away from behind a thicket of gnarled twigs; the keyboardist pounded out 
power-guitar sounding figures. Screens flashed slides of disembodied body parts 
and endless blurry videos. 
</P>
<P>
The music itself was kind of monochromatic stuff, circa-1984-era electro-hop 
beats amplified to the threshold of pain, relieved occasionally by a 
horror-movie soundtrack texture or a tinkly sequenced synth figure, though 
never by a melody or an actual riff. Death-disco colleague Ministry might 
leaven its performances with humor, Revolting C with some actual rock 'n' roll. 
Skinny Puppy's show is as bleak as the world it describes. JONATHAN GOLD

COUNTERPUNCH: THE PEOPLE, THE ARTS AND THE MESSAGE FOR THE NEA

Christopher Knight calls the reallocation of an additional 15% of National 
Endowment for the Arts funding to the state arts councils (Oct. 29) a "foolish 
scheme" that "would make the arts Establishment more beholden to local 
interests." He insists that the "NEA is important because it is national, not 
local." But as Tip O'Neill, longtime Speaker of the House, is quoted as 
admonishing, "All politics are local." 
</P>
<P>
Knight views the 15% increase designated for rural areas and urban programs as 
a means of placating conservatives by shifting funds to the states where "local 
standards" would apply. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, reporter Allan Parachini has consistently explored the consequences 
-- not the causes -- of the controversy over censorship: restricted artists, 
self-censorship, threatened freedom of speech, "disarray in the arts 
community." 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the NEA is in trouble because it failed to develop a coherent 
public policy and planning mechanisms that thoughtfully laid out where it was 
headed and what it wanted to accomplish. As a consequence, power remained 
vested in individual discipline-based programs and panels, a stranglehold that 
inevitably promoted "fractures . . . in the art community," according to the 
American Assembly report. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA kept itself "aloof and standoffish," as one congressional insider put 
it. In resolutely removing itself from the give and take of politics, it fell 
victim to its own insularity. Waiting in the wings and ready to pounce was a 
disaffected army of the disenfranchised who did not know how to break the codes 
possessed by the cognoscenti. We forgot that this was public money and that the 
people were entitled to understand the arts they were supporting. 
</P>
<P>
In pursuing a definition of "excellence" that reflected a rarefied Eurocentric 
aesthetic, the endowment left vast numbers of Americans who did not live in the 
correct Zip codes alienated. The NEA had built a constituency that consisted of 
a fragment of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
The Bipartisan Report to Congress on the NEA submitted by the Independent 
Commission emphasizes that the NEA "belongs not solely to those who receive its 
grants, but to all the people of the United States." By analogy, the NEA has 
functioned as if its job were to serve the social workers, not the clients. 
</P>
<P>
By promoting a limited view of culture and professionalism, the NEA also pushed 
artists and arts organizations into validating themselves and their work by 
escaping from their communities, not by remaining in them or relating to them. 
In effect it said, "We will fund you to tour the state, the nation in order for 
you to be recognized, but not to tour the church basements, recreational 
centers or homes for the aged in your own community." 
</P>
<P>
During the '70s, the NEA tried to correct growing opposition to its elitist 
posture with the phrase "access to the best" as the emblem for cultural 
betterment. However, it simply did not see that it was about to be hit 
broadside by an altered society discovering its diversity and individuality. 
Whether defined as women, gays, people of color, or the differently abled, a 
form of cultural democracy was emerging. "Access to the best" no longer can 
mean busing kids out of communities to cultural citadels, but instead it must 
mean adequately funding the organizations in the communities. Like politics, 
all arts are local. That an additional 15% of the NEA's budget will ultimately 
be dispensed to the states for rural and urban programs is an acknowledgement 
of the need to decentralize decision-making and to raise the long-suppressed 
question: "Who do the arts serve?" 
</P>
<P>
The importance of community has been imposed on a resistant NEA that still does 
not appear to have heard the message. Where is the national debate on public 
policy and the arts? 
</P>
<P>
The arts Establishment to which the NEA had long been beholden for 
congressional support did manage to beat back the increase from 40% to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
But both the NEA and the arts Establishment ignored the implications of 
decentralization reflected in the growth of the local arts agency movement -- 
from three arts councils in 1947 to 3,000 today. Consequently, the NEA 
forfeited an opportunity to exert leadership on policy development and lost 
control of about $2.6 million out of an already meager budget of $174 million. 
Perhaps it needs to lose more before it gets the message.

ECLECTIC HORNSBY IS EAGER TO PLEASE AT AMPHITHEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No, Bruce Hornsby's alternate career as part-time keyboardist for the Grateful 
Dead did not draw caravans of Deadheads to his concert at the Universal 
Amphitheatre on Friday. Too bad. Hordes of kids with tie-dyed eyes might have 
given the crowd some life. As it was, the pockets of Deadheads who did turn out 
seemed to be the only fans physically into the show. 
</P>
<P>
And the pockets of Dead songs that Hornsby and his band the Range peppered 
their Dead-length (three hours) set with were among its spunky highlights. So 
were bits of Ravel, Dizzy Gillespie, Leon Russell. . . . Can you say eclectic? 
</P>
<P>
But if the tall, eager-to-please Hornsby's wide scope is his greatest strength, 
it's also his weakness. On Friday, the first of two nights at Universal, he 
seemed a bit unfocused, leaving eager-to-please and eclectic as the biggest 
impressions of the presentation, and leaving the crowd largely sedate until a 
closing string of hits. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Hornsby didn't give it a commendable shot: How many performers of his 
mainstream commercial stature would invite written requests from the crowd -- 
and actually perform several of them? Rather than be a predictable hit machine, 
Hornsby wants to be free to surprise his fans with the variety of music he 
himself loves. 
</P>
<P>
The fans seemed to lack imagination, though, mostly asking for selections 
already associated with Hornsby rather than off-the-wall choices that would 
have made this a truly unique night. And with harmonica player Jimmie Wood and 
banjo wizard Bela Fleck guesting, the possibilities were vast. Isn't it more 
fun to see a band wing it on something a bit out of character than play songs 
they've played a thousand times? But at least Hornsby and crew did wing it 
some, which is more than most contemporary stars would or could do. STEVE

HANS CHOI OFFERS ITALIAN SONGS, ARIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To make one's Los Angeles debut in a church -- at a pan-cultural evening where 
East meets West on a musical/liturgical axis -- is not exactly an auspicious 
way for a singer to introduce a serious career. 
</P>
<P>
But when Hans Choi appeared Saturday at Immanuel Presbyterian, the 30-year-old 
lyric baritone was merely the centerpiece of a Christmas program put on by the 
L.A. Seoul Chorale, not even the sole reason for it. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, hardly allowed the Korean-born guest to go unappreciated. Never 
mind that children audibly chatted and cameras clicked during his performance 
of Italian songs and arias. Community pride was everywhere to be seen, not 
least on the chorale members' faces. 
</P>
<P>
Still, standing on a podium at some distance from his capable pianist, 
Ja-Hyeong Koo, Choi was hard put to create either a mood appropriate to his 
agenda items or a conducive presence. 
</P>
<P>
An avid contest candidate who has taken prizes at no fewer than 18 events -- 
this year two gold medals from the International Tchaikovsky Competition -- the 
singer seems to be in perpetual audition, or trial, mode. 
</P>
<P>
Earnest to a fault, effortful and anxious, utterly lacking the positive force 
of exhibitionism, he could give himself little opportunity to display the 
presumed artistry attached to his tone-rich voice of middle size. 
</P>
<P>
Whether singing a love song by Tosti or Rodrigo's death scene from "Don Carlo," 
he made the barest distinction. Nothing in his demeanor changed from one to the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps on the operatic stage, in character, Choi can translate his gifts to 
dramatic meaning. Here, he seemed not yet seasoned. But earlier, with the 
chorale led by Dong Hyun Kim, there were excerpts from the "Messiah" (in 
Korean), and he seemed more comfortable in solos. DONNA PERLMUTTER

FUJIKO FUJIMA AT JAPAN AMERICA THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-minute film shown prior to her appearance Saturday at the Japan America 
Theatre quickly demonstrated why Fujiko Fujima, 83, has been designated by the 
government of Japan as a Living National Treasure. 
</P>
<P>
In film clips of her performing four disparate Kabuki roles, Fujima appeared 
not only to change the weight, size and density of her body to conform to each 
character -- no easy feat for any dancer -- but also to redirect the quality 
and flow of her energy accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
She demonstrated these extraordinary abilities in person when she danced 
"Kagekiyo," a scene in which the samurai warrior of the title visits a 
courtesan. 
</P>
<P>
Dropping her center of gravity and extending force into her thighs, she created 
the power walk of the warrior. With the slightest moves of her eyebrows, she 
flashed his commanding glance, his capacity for intrigue. With the lightest 
shudder through her body, she traced the intoxicating effects of his sipping 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
Deftly reconfiguring the line of her body and density of her movements, she 
became the courtesan, in turn worried, coy, absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
At an age when some critics anticipate being in the rocking chair, Fujima took 
not a single faltering step, blurred not one movement. She held every pose with 
rock steadiness and perfectly modulated tension but moved fluidly and speedily. 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder that she has taught some of the most prominent names in modern 
Kabuki, including Tamasaburo Bando V and Danjuro Ichikawa XII, both seen 
locally with the Grand Kabuki of Japan in 1985, and Tatsunosuke Onoe, who died 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Among her students, also count her daughter, Rankei Fujima, born in 1929, who 
demonstrated the family talent in changing character in mid-dance. 
</P>
<P>
In "Mitsumen Komori," Rankei had the additional challenge of doing this with 
her face covered by various masks. Her task, discharged brilliantly, was to 
convey not only the different characters, but also the one attempting to 
impersonate them. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing the tradition is grandson Rankoh Fujima, at 28 a mere youngster in 
the art form but already sweetly accomplished. In "Kairaishi," he portrayed an 
itinerant puppeteer who magnifies the moves of his puppets, then becomes them, 
even in parodying such heroes as seen in "Kagekiyo." 
</P>
<P>
Chiseye Fujima, no blood relation to the other Fujimas, opened the program with 
the ceremonial "Matsu no Okina" and moved with weight and dignity. Fujisumi 
Fujima danced the two-part (costume change) "Shima no Senzai" with grace and 
security. Both dancers are based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Among the excellent musicians were Kichisaburo Kineya, samisen, and Kisaku 
Katada, hourglass drum. The troupe offered a different program Sunday. CHRIS 
PASLES

'A MOM FOR CHRISTMAS': DREARY HOLIDAY PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A Mom for Christmas," a Disney family movie airing on NBC tonight (9 p.m. on 
Channels 4, 36 and 39), is a good idea gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a lighthearted book by Barbara Dillon called "A Mom by Magic," this 
comic, Thorne Smith-type tale of a store mannequin who comes to life to be the 
mother of a lonely little girl should have been played strictly as fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
But writer Gerald DiPego opts for conflict and lays it on with a trowel. 
There's a nasty store detective (Carmen Argenziano) and bitterness between the 
little girl and her magic mom. More disturbingly, a Santa Claus mannequin who 
comes to life is run over by a car and dismembered. 
</P>
<P>
Merry Christmas, kids. 
</P>
<P>
The subsequent resurrection scene is equally unsettling -- children may find 
visions of Stephen King dancing in their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Director George Miller further darkens the tale with frequent tears and screams 
of anguish from his child star. Do we really need to see her shrieking 
hysterically over Santa's "body" in the street? And why does no one come out to 
see what's wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Olivia Newton-John is the free-spirited mannequin who learns to be human, 
Juliet Sorcey is the tearful little girl, Doug Sheehan is her widowed dad and 
Doris Roberts is the mysterious store decorator who makes the miracle happen. 
They do their best, but they can't rise above this holiday horror. LYNNE 
HEFFLEY

'FRENCH DANCE': SWINGING IN CAJUN COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cajun culture entered the '80s American mainstream via a brief culinary craze, 
but there's more than food to "French Dance Tonight" (airing at 9 tonight on 
KCET Channel 28). The hourlong documentary is an absorbing look at Louisiana's 
Cajun and zydeco music scene that gives a palpable sense of a people and a 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Crucially, filmmakers Les Blank, Chris Strachwitz and Maureen Gosling didn't 
get their first exposure to Cajun culture from a Paul Prudhomme cookbook. Blank 
and Gosling have made several documentaries on Louisiana music figures, and 
Strachwitz's Arhoolie label was the first outside the state to extensively 
record zydeco and Cajun artists. The research on the pre-World War II 
development of Cajun culture and music is exemplary, but zydeco and the postwar 
world get relatively short shrift. 
</P>
<P>
With musician Michael Doucet of the group Beausoleil and folklorist Barry Jean 
Ancelet serving as expert authorities, "French Dance Tonight" maintains a 
conversational, non-academic tone. Ancelet's description of the late zydeco 
king Clifton Chenier's innovations -- "He took unaccompanied, black group 
singing . . . and put it to instruments, jacked it up about 50 notches and took 
it off in the stratosphere" -- is both representative and accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Often, it's what the filmmakers don't do that lingers -- like letting the 
camera play across vintage photographs, shots of the Louisiana countryside or 
couples slow dancing in a zydeco club with no comment aside from the music. 
Everyday images -- Marc Savoy standing on his accordion, Solange Marie Falcon 
remembering her grandmother's chaperon technique, aged fiddler Canray 
Fontenont's broad grin as he plays, a dance-hall owner scattering sawdust on 
the floor -- speak volumes in "French Dance Tonight." DON SNOWDEN

2 VOICES CLAIM THEY SPEAK FOR ENCINO; 
</P>
<P>
RIVALRY: THE 10-SQUARE-MILE AREA'S PROPERTY OWNERS CAN CHOOSE FROM GROUPS WHOSE 
APPROACHES TO DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER ISSUES CLASH. MOST PEOPLE DON'T BELONG TO

<P>
Jerry Silver remembers his frustration a decade ago when the tactics of his 
fellow slow-growth activists included passing out sweets at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
As he saw it, the Encino Property Owners Assn. was "getting kicked in the teeth 
by the City Council" while naively giving council members boxes of See's candy. 
"I felt that they should take a much tougher stance on development," said 
Gerald A. Silver, who formed his own organization in 1980 after being voted off 
the association's board. 
</P>
<P>
The association no longer distributes the modest gifts -- remembered by Vice 
President Kathy Lewis as simply "a token to let them know we were interested in 
communicating with them." But the association's friendly approach endures, as 
does its sharp philosophical difference with Silver and his more militant 
splinter group, Homeowners of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Pick any issue or building project that affects Encino residents and, chances 
are, the groups' approaches will differ -- one using sugar, the other castor 
oil. Most recently, they have disagreed over the best way to reduce the size of 
a large building planned for the northeast corner of Ventura Boulevard and 
Hayvenhurst Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Of the roughly 35 homeowner groups in the San Fernando Valley, none seem to 
have such an intense rivalry or clash of styles as the two in tony, 
10-square-mile Encino. Homeowners of Encino passes out petitions, not candy, 
Silver is fond of saying. The Encino Property Owners Assn. aims for results, 
not headlines, retort Lewis and group President Robert L. Glushon. 
</P>
<P>
Silver is accused of being a self-proclaimed "voice of Encino" without a valid 
constituency; Glushon is criticized for representing developers in his private 
legal practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Encino is unique in the fact that there are two homeowner groups that 
sometimes work together and sometimes are diametrically opposed," said Gordon 
Murley, president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns., an umbrella 
organization that includes both Encino groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say Jerry Silver's group is much more adamant about good, controlled 
growth with infrastructure being in place before anything else is done, whereas 
over the years, the Encino Property Owners Assn. has been more conciliatory and 
more willing to negotiate a settlement than the other one." 
</P>
<P>
Both groups are effective in different ways and, if there is a pattern, it 
might be this: The vigilant Silver becomes alarmed over a development proposal 
and wastes no time contacting neighbors, public officials and news reporters 
with his concerns. He finds a gimmick to delay construction plans. Then the 
Encino Property Owners Assn. steps in, decides which issues to target, meets 
with the developer and wrests concessions for the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
If there weren't such obvious disdain between the two groups, it might seem as 
though they were playing out the Not-in-My-Back-Yard version of good cop-bad 
cop. 
</P>
<P>
"EPOA's style is to learn the ropes and participate more regularly" within the 
city's political system, said Cindy Miscikowski, chief deputy to Councilman 
Marvin Braude, whose district includes Encino. "Jerry is most adept at getting 
his point across in the media." 
</P>
<P>
Encino residents benefit by having both groups, said Miscikowski and Richard 
Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"The more groups involved, the better," Close said. "The goal is to put 
pressure on city officials and the more there are, and the more vocal the 
groups are, the better." 
</P>
<P>
Both groups opposed the $115-million project at Ventura and Hayvenhurst when it 
was originally unveiled as a 375,000-square-foot complex of shops, offices and 
a six-screen movie house. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, however, Property Owners has been cautiously supportive 
of a compromise that would eliminate the theaters and stores, shave off about 
40,000 square feet in floor space and exempt the project from the proposed 
Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan, a new set of zoning regulations that will 
affect all 17 miles of the Valley's "Main Street." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners of Encino, meanwhile, rejects the proposed compromise. It wants a 
reduction to five buildings of 39,500 square feet each, for a total of 197,500 
square feet -- an alternative studied in the developer's own environmental 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Said Silver, in typical outrage: "They're willing to settle for crumbs! When a 
developer says he wants 377,000 square feet and they say we worked out a deal 
for 335,000 square feet? Come on! That's no deal." 
</P>
<P>
Said Glushon: "It's a question of tactics and strategies." 
</P>
<P>
As Glushon sees it, project opponents had two options: fight the developer's 
plans with a lawsuit and risk losing in court, or target the most odious thing 
about the proposed building -- its theaters and shops and the traffic they 
would generate. 
</P>
<P>
"Our only disagreement in strategy has been Jerry's effort to just go forward 
and oppose the project without establishing any dialogue or other conditions," 
Glushon said. "And our position has been that you can't cut off that dialogue. 
You've got to fight for the best result you can get." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Gardena builder Gerald Katell found himself caught between the two 
groups while seeking a building permit for a relatively modest office building 
of 140,000 square feet at the northeast corner of Ventura and Balboa 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Katell's firm met with both homeowner groups and worked out an agreement with 
Property Owners, promising use of a community room, free parking on weekends 
and a well-landscaped building if the association did not oppose the project. 
</P>
<P>
But Homeowners of Encino challenged Katell's right to a building permit and 
demanded the preparation of a full environmental impact report -- an expensive, 
time-consuming process. In the meantime, Silver formed an unlikely coalition of 
suburbanites and American Indians to highlight the site's proximity to the 
"Lost Village of Encino," a large, centuries-old Indian village excavated in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Silver ultimately lost the battle for the environmental report. But the city 
Building and Safety Commission agreed with Silver that officials had overlooked 
the need for archeological precautions. The commission told Katell to hire an 
archeologist and American Indian as construction consultants, in case any 
significant artifacts turned up. 
</P>
<P>
Most significantly, by seizing upon the archeology issue, Silver was able to 
delay Katell's project nearly four months -- just long enough for the 
commercial real estate market to go soft. Today, Katell's building site remains 
unused while he tries to secure tenants and financing. 
</P>
<P>
"With the other group, we got feedback, whereas with Silver, we were not able 
to do that," Katell said recently. "It was adversarial." 
</P>
<P>
The contrasting styles of Encino's homeowner associations are embodied in their 
presidents -- the strident Silver, 58, a college business administration 
instructor, and the smooth Glushon, 37, a land-use attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Silver was 11 when his family moved to Los Angeles from Omaha, and he waxes 
nostalgic about raising his own four children in North Hollywood during the 
1950s and '60s -- "a delightful time" when he could pick them up from school, 
run several errands and still make the children's 4 o'clock music lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"You could park in front of stores, in front of shops," said Silver, who moved 
to Encino in 1978. "There were no parking meters. The streets were open. People 
lived in single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, you cannot park in front of the stores. There are parking meters, and 
the streets off Ventura Boulevard are clogged," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Silver, who first became an activist fighting airplane noise in the late 1950s, 
readily acknowledges that he would turn back the clock if he could. Fighting 
overdevelopment is a time-consuming task, but his schedule at Los Angeles City 
College, plus royalties from textbooks he has written, enable him to attend 
daytime hearings, pore over files at City Hall, prepare exhaustive briefs and 
pass out flyers in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my favorite flyers of his was called, 'Nightmare on Gaviota Street,' " 
said Miscikowski, Braude's deputy. "He's inflammatory in a way, but he gets 
people's attention." 
</P>
<P>
Silver also enjoys an ample amount of media attention -- too much, contend 
Glushon and others who question the size of Silver's constituency. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone can form their own organization," Glushon said. "He doesn't get under 
my skin at all except when he is quoted in the media as representing the 
homeowners and residents of Encino saying they don't want rail transportation. 
He's not representing the majority of people in Encino." 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to verify the memberships of homeowner groups, which are 
private, nonprofit organizations. The Encino Property Owners Assn., one of the 
oldest homeowner groups in the Valley, claims a membership of about 1,000 
households. Homeowners of Encino claims about 300 households. 
</P>
<P>
With Encino's population at about 43,000, according to 1990 population 
projections, neither group can claim to represent a majority. 
</P>
<P>
What he lacks in constituency, however, Silver makes up for in zeal. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't give five-pound boxes of chocolate," Silver said, relishing the role 
of needler and outsider. 
</P>
<P>
Glushon, on the other hand, does not dispute Silver's characterization of him 
as a political insider. He said he is proud of his work for Councilmen Marvin 
Braude, Joel Wachs and Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
An Encino native, Glushon worked as Braude's Valley field representative from 
1977 to 1981. He was a student intern for Wachs and participated in 
Yaroslavsky's aborted 1989 mayoral campaign in the Valley. He also served on 
Mayor Tom Bradley's Telecommunications Commission and Environmental Quality 
Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
The tanned, business-suited Glushon fits into upscale Encino more neatly than 
Silver, a graying, paunchy man recognizable by his trademark beard, neatly 
pressed sports shirts and Western belt buckle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of my background at City Hall and it actually has worked to the 
advantage of EPOA in using those connections . . . on a wide variety of 
issues," Glushon said. 
</P>
<P>
Glushon, in his second year as Property Owners president, sees himself as a 
mediator whose legal and political expertise can help bring about compromise 
between builders and residents. He recognizes the rights of property owners but 
feels that they should also respect the wishes of their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner groups need to pick their battles, he said. "You have to distinguish 
between what is inevitable and . . . get as much as you can to protect the 
community," Glushon said, "and where you draw the line, and fight to stop 
something that is stoppable." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Glushon represents developers in his private legal practice; clients 
have included builders in Woodland Hills, Panorama City and Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Glushon said he also represents homeowners, however, and scrupulously refuses 
to take developer clients from Encino to avoid even the appearance of a 
conflict of interest. Still, Murley of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon 
Assns. said he considers Glushon's dual role inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had a problem with people in real estate, or attorneys 
representing developers, representing homeowners. We feel it's a conflict of 
interest," said Murley, who fought one of Glushon's clients, the West Hills 
Condominiums, as president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The 80-unit project became mired in a controversy over its building permits two 
years ago during its final phase of construction. The outcome, which allowed 
the buildings to be higher than neighbors wanted, left Murley and some nearby 
residents bitter. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Glushon's work on behalf of a townhouse builder in Panorama City 
was praised both by neighbors and aides to Wachs, who credited Glushon with 
persuading developer Barry Shy to listen to community concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really helped to open communication between the developer, the council 
office and the community," said Arlene De Sanctis, Wachs' chief deputy for 
planning in the Valley. The project at Nordhoff Street and Willis Avenue is in 
Wachs' district. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people always wonder when they hear somebody's the head of a 
homeowners group, how they can do that, how they can juggle it," De Sanctis 
said of Glushon. "But I know in this case he seemed to very fairly represent 
the developer and the constituency also." 
</P>
<P>
Glushon won't rule out a future political career, although he said supporting 
his wife and three children precludes that now. Silver, meanwhile, shuns the 
idea as strongly as he shunned the See's candy. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had political aspirations, I would not be working so hard to become 
unpopular," Silver said. "And let me tell you why I don't have political 
aspirations -- because politicians by their nature have to represent both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to bring a balance. I want to represent my personal interests and 
those of my neighbors. And we are not about to sit around and bring about 
compromise."

DEVELOPER BLAMES BANKRUPTCY ON 8-YEAR BURBANK FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: ALTHOUGH HE WON APPROVAL LAST MONTH TO BUILD 129 LUXURY HOUSES, 
SHERMAN WHITMORE IV HAS OTHER BUSINESS VENTURES THAT ARE IN TROUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sherman Whitmore IV, the combative developer whose plans to build in the 
Verdugo Mountains above Burbank kindled public ire for nearly eight years, 
claims that the protracted battle has forced him into bankruptcy in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore fought Burbank residents and officials over his plans to build 129 
luxury houses on 117 acres he owns in Cabrini Canyon. Burbank City Council 
members gave reluctant blessing to the development last month after Whitmore 
met all 112 conditions the city set for approval. 
</P>
<P>
But the victory may be too late for Whitmore, who in October filed for federal 
bankruptcy protection for two Florida companies after Miami officials demanded 
money he owed them on a project to renovate a dilapidated, city-owned boatyard. 
</P>
<P>
Miami City Atty. Jorge L. Fernandez said Whitmore has done no work on Dinner 
Key Boatyard and paid no rent since he won a city contract in April to develop 
it. Whitmore now owes more than $300,000 in back rent and fees, and the city is 
trying to evict him and the mortgaged 68-foot yacht on which he lives. The 
city's legal action against Whitmore is on hold pending further hearings in his 
bankruptcy cases filed Oct. 26 for Cal-Florida Marine Industries and the Dinner 
Key Boatyard Joint Venture, both Miami companies. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore did not return repeated calls seeking comment, but Miami city 
officials and Whitmore's business partners said the developer has consistently 
blamed his financial problems in Miami on delays in his Cabrini Canyon project. 
He told Miami officials that he soon stands to gain several million dollars 
from lot sales in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the J. M. Peters Co., the Newport Beach developer who 
will pay Whitmore for the right to build on the hillside, said no payment 
schedule has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Whitmore won the right to develop the hillside, in a sense there 
were only losers in the battle. The group of residents who fought to defeat the 
project was unable to achieve its ultimate goal: preservation of a wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
No solid estimate is available for how much the delays cost Whitmore, but one 
of his attorneys said the loss could be as high as $30 million in expenses and 
lost revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Neither party will say how much the J. M. Peters Co. will pay Whitmore for his 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank officials said Whitmore has assured them that his difficulties in Miami 
will not affect his Cabrini Canyon plans. Community Development Director 
William Kelly said that since much of the development will be done by a company 
not owned by Whitmore, city officials view Whitmore's Miami dealings more as an 
interesting sidelight than a threat to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Bird, an attorney representing Whitmore's Burbank Hill Properties Co., 
said Whitmore's Miami ventures were "totally separate" from his California 
holdings. He did, however, acknowledge that "success here would make life 
easier" for Whitmore in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
George dePozsgay, the Miami attorney handling Whitmore's bankruptcy case, 
refused to comment. Judge Sidney M. Weaver, who is presiding over the 
bankruptcy proceedings, declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Dunn, a partner in Whitmore's boatyard project, said he and other 
partners have filed suit to remove Whitmore from the operation. Dunn said 
members of the Dinner Key Boatyard Joint Venture feel betrayed by Whitmore, who 
they said rolled into town in a white Rolls-Royce with a financial statement 
showing that he was worth $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore was to provide the financial support needed by the partnership -- 
largely composed of respected Miami businessmen -- to renovate the boatyard and 
marina, but was unable to secure financing for the project. He once promised to 
finance the $6-million renovation personally, but never produced the money. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn said that when Whitmore's partners questioned him about his dealings in 
Burbank, "he would tell us California was none of our business." Dunn added 
that Whitmore ignored his partners when they asked questions about the Miami 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore's combative demeanor has won him few friends in Burbank or Miami. "If 
he never showed up here again, it would be too soon," Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore once described Burbank city officials' behavior in their dealings with 
him as unconscionable. And at a meeting last month, Whitmore sat smiling coolly 
in the front row while Burbank Mayor Thomas Flavin sharply criticized the 
developer for his attitude during the eight-year battle. 
</P>
<P>
"These people view my hills as being their hills," Whitmore said in a 1986 
interview. "Well, one way or another, I'm going to develop them or they're 
going to buy them." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials from the J. M. Peters Co. said delays in the Burbank 
project have cost them nearly $1 million in actual expenses and perhaps several 
times that in revenues lost because of the sluggish housing market. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Lukes, a J. M. Peters planning director, said the slump in house sales 
prompted the company to reconsider the type of residences to be built on the 
property. Original plans called for houses costing $350,000 to $800,000. Lukes 
said houses on the project may be scaled down but added that nothing has been 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
The delays were caused in large part by a group of residents who rallied around 
1.4 acres of federally protected wetlands that will be destroyed when grading 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Wilson of the Burbank Mountain Reserve Protection Assn. said the group, 
which opposed the development, has not decided on its next move. She declined 
to comment further except to say that "the big losers are the animals" who use 
the wetlands as a stopover during migration. 
</P>
<P>
In approving the project, council members ordered the city's public works 
director to withhold a grading permit until Whitmore proves that the wetlands 
will be replaced. He is required by federal law to create or enhance at least 
3.5 acres of habitat elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, council members reduced the number of dwellings Whitmore could build 
by nearly a third -- from 181 to 129 -- and attached 112 conditions to final 
approval. Community Development Director William Kelly said in a memo that 
Whitmore had met all 112 conditions, thereby eliminating any legal basis the 
council would have had to reject the project. 
</P>
<P>
The council's final vote was 3 to 1, with Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard 
dissenting and Councilman Robert Bowne abstaining. Bowne removed himself from 
discussion of the project after several people at the meeting accused him of 
having a conflict of interest, saying he had reserved a lot in the tract. 
</P>
<P>
Bowne denied the allegations but said he excused himself to avoid the 
appearance of a conflict. He acknowledged that he had expressed an interest in 
purchasing a lot in the development but said he had never made any formal 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
The decision ended eight years of bitter public debate over the future of the 
property. Whitmore first proposed developing the hillside land in the early 
1980s, when he bought it. Several of his early plans were rejected by the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Envisioning a greenbelt in the hills behind Burbank, city officials in 1985 
received a $3-million state grant to buy Whitmore's land outright for use as 
undeveloped open space. But Whitmore and the city were unable to reach 
agreement on a purchase price and negotiations broke off.

D. A. LOOKING AT MAYOR'S ACTIONS IN PROPERTY VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
LANCASTER: THE CITY OFFICIAL HAS ACKNOWLEDGED GETTING A SUBSEQUENT $9,780 
COMMISSION, BUT SAYS HE DID NOT KNOW HE WAS TO RECEIVE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has opened a formal 
investigation to determine whether Lancaster Mayor William Pursley should face 
criminal conflict-of-interest charges for voting on a property from which he 
later earned a nearly $10,000 sales commission. 
</P>
<P>
County prosecutors have been informally reviewing Pursley's actions, which 
appear to be in violation of state conflict-of-interest laws, since they were 
disclosed last month in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"When we feel there may be something substantive to it, we open an 
investigation and look into it more closely," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom 
Wenke, a prosecutor in the special investigations division, which handles 
criminal probes of official misconduct by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Pursley's attorney, Robert Berke, said he had not heard of the district 
attorney's decision to intensify the inquiry and had no other comment. Pursley 
has acknowledged his council vote and commission income, but insists that he 
did not know at the time of the vote that he was to receive money from the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Wenke said he could not discuss how the inquiry will be conducted or how long 
it will last. But in a similar case involving Lancaster officials from 1983 to 
1985, district attorney investigators conducted scores of interviews, gathered 
city records and served search warrants at two businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The Pursley investigation will focus on the mayor's introduction of and vote on 
a measure passed by the Lancaster council June 18, which reduced a city 
easement on land owned by Clyde Golding, one of Pursley's business partners. 
Golding said the council action was instrumental in clinching a pending sale of 
the one-acre parcel. Pursley, his real estate agent, earned a $9,780 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
State law makes it illegal for public officials to vote on or participate in 
decisions in which they have a foreseeable financial interest. Apart from the 
criminal investigation, Pursley's case is also under review by the state's Fair 
Political Practices Commission, which can fine violators. 
</P>
<P>
Officials convicted of criminal conflict of interest, a misdemeanor charge, can 
be barred from running for office for four years. Although offenders can face 
jail time, such cases are rare and most violators are fined by the FPPC. 
</P>
<P>
County prosecutors have only filed several such cases in recent years, 
including one in which former Lancaster Councilman Louis Bozigian was acquitted 
in 1986. Prosecutors had charged that Bozigian voted for a street map that 
benefited property he was representing. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain a conviction, the prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable 
doubt and obtain a unanimous jury verdict.

POLICE RECAPTURE ESCAPED CONVICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prisoner who escaped from the downtown County Jail on Friday -- just hours 
after he had been sentenced to 10 years in prison for assault with a deadly 
weapon -- was captured early Sunday in North Park, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Anthony O'Donnell was captured about 4 a.m. in the 3300 block of Herman 
Avenue after officers received a report of a prowler at a house in the nearby 
3300 block of 31st Street. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell was captured after he was spotted running from the house, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell was taken back to jail and held on suspicion of escape and attempted 
burglary, police said. 
</P>
<P>
He had escaped sometime between 6:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. Friday, sheriff's deputies 
said, and was discovered missing during a nightly count. Officials said he may 
have escaped by mingling with other inmates who were being released.

REINING CHAMPION; 
</P>
<P>
HORSEMANSHIP: FRANK HYDE, A COMPETITION RIDER FOR 50 YEARS AND AN EQUESTRIAN 
HALL OF FAME MEMBER, HAS TAUGHT THE SPORT TO THOUSANDS AT HIS SOMIS RANCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Hyde blushed as his wife, Clara, called him one of the fastest horsemen 
who ever lived, then hopped on a 4-year-old quarter horse named Royal Glow and 
gave his wife a wink. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see if this horse can run," the 73-year-old Somis equestrian said. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, after a careful, deliberate warm-up, Hyde gave the signal and 
the horse took off. In eight seconds, he had raced the length of a 100-yard 
course back and forth, crisscrossing six poles along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Clara Hyde, 70, barely paid attention. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't get scared," she said. "I've seen him do it so many times . . . 
but it sounds kind of callous doesn't it? Because the horse may slip and fall, 
and I don't want him to get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The first ride of the morning made Frank Hyde as excited as a child. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want me to do it again?" he asked, smiling. And then off he went, again 
and again. 
</P>
<P>
For five decades, Hyde has been a fixture in equestrian gymkhana in arenas 
throughout California, where some of the state's best horsemen go head to head 
in a series of barrel races, pole races and assorted obstacle course races. 
</P>
<P>
Hyde has been around horses ever since his days on a Missouri farm when he and 
his friends would race to school. A half-century ago he moved to California. 
He's been racing in gymkhana events ever since. 
</P>
<P>
And to this day, few cowboys can outride him. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hyde won a state competition and placed second in three others, 
racing against men and women young enough to be his grandchildren. In 1986, he 
became the oldest rider ever to place a horse in the Gymkhana Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Only the top dozen or so in a field of more than 1,000 competitors make the 
hall of fame in any given year. Virtually all of them are in their teens and 
20s, and chances are that Hyde trained at least some of them. 
</P>
<P>
"With me, I never try to make a horse have fear," he said. "I rarely use a 
whip, and never use spurs in training. I want the horse to want to do it, so I 
take my time until he knows what I want from him." 
</P>
<P>
On his six-acre ranch near Somis, thousands of youngsters have learned the 
sport and the ethics of horsemanship. 
</P>
<P>
Until three years ago, Hyde would house his pupils in his barn, which had been 
converted into a 20-bed dormitory. Hyde's five-day clinics attracted youngsters 
from all over the state. The waiting lists were so long that candidates had to 
wait more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his riding students grew up to become hall of famers and returned to 
Hyde's ranch to bring their children to the clinics. Hyde's alumni became known 
in horse circles all over the state as "Hyde's Trybe." 
</P>
<P>
His students swear by their mentor. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the greatest. He's taught so many of us how to ride," country-Western 
singer Scarlett Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"He helps me a lot," agreed her 20-year-old daughter Jennifer, who has been 
learning from Hyde for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an extraordinary man, best person I ever met," said Merle McClendon, an 
old student who is an accountant in San Jose. "He teaches us to be patient and 
to be fair to the horses, to be good winners and good losers, and all the other 
good values Frank lives by." 
</P>
<P>
Hyde gets up every morning at 6 to feed the horses and take care of the ranch, 
which he does single-handedly. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried hiring people to help Frank, but they never last," his wife said. 
"They complain there's too much work, and Frank feels they get in the way." 
</P>
<P>
He makes his own tools and horse gear, and he rides several hours every day. He 
still breaks in horses never ridden, and he still helps dozens of young riders 
who seek him out in horse shows, call him or visit his home in search of riding 
or training tips. 
</P>
<P>
"Been married with him for 40 years and I still wouldn't trade him for 
anybody," Clara Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
After the morning workout, Hyde chuckled when asked if this year he thinks he 
can possibly top last year's performance at the state championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," he replied, "because this year I'll be older and have a little more 
experience."

ANTI-SMOG ORDERS MAY DOUBLE FIRMS WITH 4-DAY WORKWEEKS; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: COUNTY BUSINESSES HAVING MORE THAN 100 EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN TOLD TO 
DEVISE PLANS TO REDUCE COMMUTER TRAFFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The number of Ventura County businesses that offer employees four-day weeks and 
other alternative work schedules could double in the next four years as firms 
struggle to meet new pollution-control standards, experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to fight smog, the county has ordered large businesses to find 
ways to reduce the number of times employees drive to work alone each week. One 
suggestion offered by the county is to cut back the number of days that 
employees are required to work. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most promising strategies is the compressed workweek," said Gail 
Matz, a transportation specialist for the county Air Pollution Control 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a win-win situation: Studies have shown employees on compressed workweeks 
generally are more satisfied with their jobs, their morale is higher and they 
and supervisors feel productivity is greater." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, an estimated 11% of the county's more than 700 businesses with 50 or 
more employees offer a compressed workweek -- which means that 40 hours of work 
are compressed into fewer than five days, according to Commuter Transportation 
Services of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The private, nonprofit organization has studied revised work schedules and 
their effect on pollution, transportation and work conditions at companies 
throughout Southern California, said Stuart Anderson, planning manager for the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he anticipates that the number of businesses using compressed 
schedules will double as companies try to comply with a regulation of the Air 
Pollution Control District designed to bring Ventura County into compliance 
with state and federal clean-air laws. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the district began sending notices to 200 county businesses that 
have more than 100 employees, Matz said. Those employers have 120 days to come 
up with plans to reduce vehicle ridership among employees, Matz said. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1991, businesses with more than 75 employees will fall under the 
district regulation, and companies with more than 50 employees will become 
subject to the regulations in January, 1992. Companies that fail to achieve 
specific goals are not penalized under the program, but if they do not submit 
any plan at all they can be fined up to $25,000 daily. 
</P>
<P>
The companies may choose from a number of options to reduce the car trips 
employees make alone. They can offer financial incentives for employees who 
car-pool or use public transit. They can build lockers and showers for workers 
who bike or walk. Or, they can supply deterrents to driving, like charging for 
parking in the company lot. 
</P>
<P>
But the most promising way of reducing ridership is the restructuring of work 
schedules, Matz said. A schedule like the four-day week, in which employees 
work four 10-hour days a week, immediately cuts 20% of the trips to the office, 
officials said. The 9-80 plan, which requires employees to work 80 hours over 
nine days every two weeks, is another option. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Ventura County's two largest employers already are looking into 
compressed schedules. 
</P>
<P>
The county is negotiating with labor unions to see if it can offer its 6,500 
employees the option of a compressed workweek, said Susan Van Abel, an 
administrative analyst in the county Chief Administrative Office. 
</P>
<P>
Some county departments already use the compressed schedules effectively. And a 
survey of employees in three county departments that tested the schedules in a 
six-month trial program that ended in April showed a highly favorable response, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 300 people who participated in the trial run, 83% said morale improved, 
50% indicated an increase in productivity and 74% indicated increased job 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
However, some problems cropped up, Van Abel said. Some employees had trouble 
completing their work in four days. And important meetings sometimes fell on 
days off, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu, where 9,700 civilians and 
military personnel are on the payroll, also is running a pilot project with the 
100 employees in its Human Resources Office. The Navy base is considering 
adopting the 9-80 work schedule for its 5,000 civilian workers to help reduce 
pollution, Lt. Cmdr. Gene Okamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
But fighting smog has not always been the impetus behind using the compressed 
workweek. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard Police Department implemented the four-day week for patrol officers 
in 1975 so overlapping shifts would put more police officers on city streets 
during times of high crime. The county Public Social Services Agency switched 
400 of its 750 employees to the 9-80 schedule in 1975 because social workers 
and welfare eligibility officers needed longer weekends to combat the stress of 
the job, said Curt Hansen, personnel officer for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
And other county agencies also switched employees to revised schedules years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the county assessor's office, 55% of the 143 employees work a four-day week. 
The office adopted the schedule in 1973 because assessors were losing valuable 
work time during the commute to properties in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks. 
The longer day allowed them to stay and work longer, Assistant Assessor Glenn 
Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
The road maintenance division of the county Public Works Agency switched 76 
employees to the four-day week in the mid-1970s to reduce fuel consumption 
during the energy crisis. 
</P>
<P>
It ran smoothly for the most part. However, Loren Blair, deputy director of 
public works, said some unexpected problems arose. 
</P>
<P>
Machine operators had to adjust to the longer day. And, unexpectedly, some 
employees had problems with the longer weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged to pursue more hobbies with the extra time off, some employees began 
buying expensive recreational items and ran into some financial problems, Blair 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the grumbling soon stopped and the program runs smoothly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
And employees at other businesses give the shorter weeks rave reviews, saying 
the long weekends let them spend more time with their families, devote energy 
to other pursuits and just plain relax. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 officers in the Oxnard Police Department are attending college on 
their days off to complete bachelor's or master's degrees, Oxnard Police Lt. 
Tom Cady said. Five officers used their days off to coach different sports 
programs, such as junior varsity teams at local high schools. 
</P>
<P>
And some officers have devoted the extra time to developing businesses on the 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Mike Alford, 43, began a boat-repair business during his days off three 
years ago. The business, which grew to the point that Alford had to hire three 
employees, brings in about $5,000 a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also has received rave reviews from officers in the Ventura Police 
Department, which switched patrol officers to the schedule in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd fight to the death to make sure the schedule's maintained," Ventura 
Police Lt. A.J. Farrar said. Close to 70% of the department's 122 sworn 
officers and 70 civilian employees are on the schedule, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cpl. John Leach of the Ventura Police Department had been a homicide detective 
for 11 years when he decided to return to patrols, partly in order to enjoy the 
three-day weekends. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some guys who will stay in patrol forever just because of that," 
Leach said.

The gingerbread version of Ventura City Hall looks a lot like the local 
landmark -- with one delicious difference. The duplicate may be eaten before 
Christmas by the fifth-graders who built it. 
</P>
<P>
Invited to enter a holiday gingerbread house contest sponsored by the 
Doubletree Hotel in Ventura, Patti Gudaz's class at Pierpont School in Ventura 
took up the challenge with zest. 
</P>
<P>
The made-from-scratch gingerbread base is covered in white icing and has three 
large green candies on the roof to represent the stained-glass domes in the 
council chamber's ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"The most fun was putting the candy windows in and icing it," said Molly 
Wingland, who said she hopes to get to eat some of her work. 
</P>
<P>
Her teacher was delighted with the end product and with how much the children 
learned from the project. 
</P>
<P>
Gudaz said the children walked to City Hall from the school, took a tour of the 
building and learned about its history. 
</P>
<P>
The class sketched the building for an art project. As a math lesson, students 
paced off the length and width of the building and, back at school, transferred 
the information to graph paper and built their gingerbread City Hall to scale. 
</P>
<P>
The children wrote books about how they made the gingerbread, icing and candy 
in the school kitchen. "It's a lot of work, but the children were really proud 
of themselves," Gudaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Ventura classes also built local landmarks. Jessie MacLeod's first- 
and second-graders at Lincoln School erected a replica of the lighthouse on 
Anacapa Island. Greta Box's fourth- and fifth-grade class at Pierpont School 
spent four days assembling its version of the Ventura Pier, complete with 
people strolling on it. 
</P>
<P>
"When we made the people, so it wouldn't be just a pier sitting there without 
anyone on it, I just gave them marshmallows and candy and pipe cleaners and 
they made some very clever things," Box said. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey Nicholson's second-graders at Poinsettia School in Ventura erected a 
small version of their school, using pink wafers for the roof tiles, candy 
canes for the playground equipment and licorice to outline the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh- and eighth-graders at Hueneme Christian School in Port Hueneme helped 
decorate a 19-foot-high gingerbread house built by the Doubletree staff and 
created two miniature houses of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun, but hard. The roof kept falling in. It took teamwork," Essence 
Shannon, 12, said of the 15-inch-high house she and her friends built. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Saticoy and Elmhurst schools in Ventura also entered the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
The confectionary town will be on display through Dec. 21 in the hotel lobby, 
where guests and community members can vote on the best entries. The top three 
winners will receive prizes. CAROL WEINSTOCK

MAYOR TAKES OVER DISASTER TEAM POST

<P>
Ojai Mayor Nina V. Shelley has replaced retired county Fire Capt. Ed Gutierrez 
as head of the disaster committee for the Ojai Valley chapter of the American 
Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason I cannot work with the Red Cross as a mayor," Shelley said. 
</P>
<P>
"The duties of the disaster committee chair have more to do with making sure 
the team is in a mode of readiness long before the disaster occurs." 
</P>
<P>
The geography of the Ojai Valley, which isolated it from Ventura during the 
1969 floods, is one reason that residents have maintained the only separate Red 
Cross chapter in the county, Shelley said. 
</P>
<P>
Its board of directors and volunteers work closely with the Ventura County 
chapter, Shelley said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez, who headed the committee for 14 years, will continue to coordinate 
emergency shelter operations and help families who lose their houses to such 
disasters as fire, flood or earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
A former captain in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve, Shelley served on the 
Ojai chapter's board for three years while taking other emergency management 
training. She recently spent 20 hours updating her first-aid skills. 
</P>
<P>
Shelley was mayor during the 1985 fires that surrounded Ojai, caused mass 
evacuations, the loss of houses and burned 119,000 acres of Los Padres National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor's duties are not clearly defined. You're just expected to provide 
leadership," she said. Her appointed mayoral post ends in April, but she will 
remain on the Ojai City Council until her four-year term is up in 1994. THIA

75 ATTEND TEACH-IN ON GULF CRISIS

Reminiscent of teach-ins during the 1960s, clusters of college and high school 
students lounged quietly on the grass at Ventura College Sunday, listening to 
rock bands and applauding activists speaking against war. 
</P>
<P>
The group of about 75 students did not carry placards or march, chanting, 
through town. Instead, the rally's organizers said they wanted to give a 
history lesson on the Mideast conflict and point out the social and 
environmental reasons not to go to war. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want the 'Hell no, we won't go' attitude," said Cathy Sparks, a 
religious studies major who organized the event with her husband, Jeff. "This 
is an educational forum. . . .We thought we'd give people a day to get together 
for peace." 
</P>
<P>
She added, "I'm hoping more people will get together and have teach-ins." 
</P>
<P>
Mindy Lorenz, the Green Party leader who ran as a write-in candidate in the 
19th congressional district in November, spoke to a group of about 75 students 
about her activism in college more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tragic that we didn't learn some of the lessons of Vietnam," Lorenz said. 
"We can no longer solve conflicts through military means." 
</P>
<P>
The Green Party supports removing troops from Saudi Arabia and replacing them 
with a United Nations peacekeeping force, Lorenz said. The party also advocates 
continued use of economic sanctions against Iraq, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Armando Zumaya, who heads Sane Freeze, a Santa Barbara-based organization for 
nuclear disarmament, told the students not to be discouraged by the small size 
of their crowd. "This is how it starts," he told the students gathered on the 
campus lawn. 
</P>
<P>
If war breaks out in the Middle East, Zumaya said U.S. troops will be fighting 
to benefit the oil interests in the region. "This is not about democracy," he 
said. "This is not about freedom. This is about people's profit margins."

<P>
APARTHEID: GUERRILLA WAR COULD BE RESUMED IF ALL OBSTACLES TO NEGOTIATIONS ARE 
NOT REMOVED, THE DELEGATES WARN. MANDELA'S DEALINGS WITH THE REGIME ARE

<P>
The African National Congress' first consultative conference in 31 years 
concluded Sunday with a militant ultimatum to the government: remove all 
obstacles to negotiations by the end of April or the ANC will consider 
suspending talks and resuming its guerrilla war. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-line ANC attitude was further reflected in the revelation that Deputy 
President Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders had been sharply criticized 
during closed sessions of the three-day meeting for their conduct during talks 
with the government thus far. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela himself mentioned the criticism in his closing address to the 1,600 
delegates, many of whom are clearly uneasy talking to a government that, in 
their view, wants to maintain white domination of the black majority. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela told delegates he welcomed the frank evaluation of the ANC leaders' 
failings, but he also strongly defended his confidential discussions with the 
government, his reference to President Frederik W. de Klerk as "a man of 
integrity" and his contacts with leaders of the nominally independent black 
homelands. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela added, the ANC's ability to raise its complaints with the 
leadership had been a healthy step for the once-revolutionary movement, which 
has been legal in South Africa for only 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
"We have emerged from this congress stronger than we were before," Mandela said 
to loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
For several months, militant ANC members have expressed private concern that 
the 72-year-old Mandela, the leader of talks with the government, has been 
unaware of the growing distrust of the Pretoria government among rank-and-file 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Several resolutions passed by the conference over the weekend contained 
specific demands that the ANC's 37-member national executive committee consult 
more closely with members nationwide. And the conference resolutions indicated 
a militancy that surprised many political analysts. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the ANC flatly rejected a proposal, advanced by the influential 
foreign affairs chief, Thabo Mbeki, that it draw up a plan for a phased removal 
of sanctions against Pretoria, even as worldwide sanctions are beginning to 
crumble. Mbeki said Sunday that the proposal is still being studied, however. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ANC decided to proceed with "talks about talks" with the 
government, it expressed dissatisfaction with the government's pace of reform 
and said the government must clear away several obstacles before formal 
constitutional negotiations can begin. The government has said it hopes to 
launch those negotiations early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the obstacles cited by the ANC were the release of all political 
prisoners, the return of exiles, the repeal of repressive legislation and the 
end of political trials. The government agreed in August to begin granting 
amnesty for prisoners and exiles, but the process has been slowed by delays and 
administrative difficulties on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the clear view of the conference that in order to get the negotiation 
process going, much, much more has to be done (by the government)," said Joe 
Slovo, a leading figure on the ANC executive. "Until those steps are taken, we 
don't see a prospect of beginning proper negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC also decided to launch a campaign of protests, marches and other forms 
of mass action to pressure De Klerk to remove those obstacles and end black 
factional fighting, which has claimed more than 3,000 lives in South African 
townships this year. The ANC claims the township violence is being orchestrated 
by government agencies, including the security forces, in an attempt to 
undermine support for the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
"Our patience with this regime is running out," the conference said in its 
closing declaration. "The regime has its own agenda, that of retaining white 
domination in a new form. It is violating and distorting all its undertakings 
to the ANC and the people." 
</P>
<P>
The conference added that the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of 
the Nation), "must play a facilitative role in the defense of our people." 
</P>
<P>
"Our people are being butchered in their homes," said Joe Modise, the Umkhonto 
we Sizwe commander. "And it is the legitimate right of the people to defend 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC agreed in August to suspend its armed struggle against Pretoria, but 
the two sides have yet to agree on terms of dismantling of the ANC's 
underground guerrilla forces. 
</P>
<P>
In a rare public assessment of the ANC's internal difficulties, Mandela 
admitted that the organization has been slow to establish links of 
communication between the leaders and its 300,000 members across the country. 
However, he added that "we are really now at the stage that we feel confident 
we are in physical contact with our people." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela also responded in detail to delegates' criticisms of his handling of 
talks with the government. He said suggestions that the ANC halt all 
confidential discussions with the government "are totally unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
"There would have been no . . . future prospect of negotiations if there were 
no confidential meetings between the ANC and the government," he said. He added 
that having confidential talks "does not mean we are compromising our 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela rejected a suggestion that ANC leaders take no actions without 
consulting the members, saying such a proposal could "only be made by people 
who have no idea of the problems that face the leadership on the ground." And 
he cited half a dozen instances in which his personal calls to President De 
Klerk or Cabinet members had resolved urgent problems facing ANC members. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela also responded to criticism that he was wrong to refer to De Klerk, as 
he often has, as "a man of integrity." 
</P>
<P>
"The strategies of our organization are not determined by the integrity or 
honesty of any particular individual," Mandela said. "Our strategy is guided by 
the fact that De Klerk represents apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
Some delegates had criticized ANC leaders for inviting chiefs of the black 
homelands to join negotiations. Mandela defended that decision, saying that one 
of the ways of isolating the government was "to get at people upon whom they 
(the government) have relied for support of apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
And Mandela noted that many African countries have been racked by civil wars 
because the black governments refused to enter discussions with their enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope our (ANC) comrades would take account of such experiences and ensure 
such tragedies don't befall us," Mandela said.

CASES MAY CHART FUTURE OF SCHOOL DESEGREGATION

<P>
The legal effort to dismantle segregated schools began in this Kansas capital 
nearly four decades ago. In the next year, it may end here. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court used a lawsuit begun by a group of Topeka's black parents in 
1951 to issue its most sweeping ruling of the 20th Century. Official 
segregation violates the Constitution, the court declared in 1954 in Brown vs. 
Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling reverberated through the courts and through American society. 
Because of it, racial exclusion policies in schools and colleges, on buses and 
railroads, in housing and workplaces and in restaurants and hotels were swept 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
In follow-up cases, the high court said that not only must blatant segregation 
end, but that school officials had "an affirmative duty" to eliminate the 
"vestiges" of the old system. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Supreme Court and school desegregation are at a crossroads. With 
official segregation long past, many school officials say, it is time to get 
the courts out of the business of running schools. In three cases on the court 
docket this term, school boards are urging the justices to do just that. One of 
them is the Topeka case (Board of Education vs. Brown, 89-1681). 
</P>
<P>
Today, of course, Topeka has no all-white or all-black schools. Still, more 
than half of the city's black students are concentrated in four of its 26 
elementary schools. Linda Brown Buckner, the original plaintiff in the Brown 
lawsuit, has a grandson in a school where more than 70% of the children are 
black or Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a federal appeals court said that the Topeka school board had 
practiced "a form of benign neglect" toward its minority students. It ruled 
that the school district must do more to desegregate its classrooms. In April, 
the school board appealed that decision to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we've satisfied our constitutional obligation," said K. Gary 
Sebelius, the school district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The case comes before an increasingly conservative Supreme Court led by Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist, long a bitter foe of school desegregation. As a 
parent in Phoenix in 1967, Rehnquist strongly opposed a voluntary integration 
plan that was being considered by local schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We are no more dedicated to an 'integrated' society than we are to a 
'segregated' society," he said in a letter to the Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>
As a Justice Department official in the Richard M. Nixon Administration, 
Rehnquist drafted a constitutional amendment to forbid courts from ordering 
busing for desegregation. And as a Supreme Court justice since 1972, he has 
dissented every time a desegregation plan has been upheld. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting next to Rehnquist on the bench is Justice Thurgood Marshall, the NAACP 
Legal Defense Fund lawyer who represented the winning side before the Supreme 
Court in the original Brown ruling. While Rehnquist thinks that desegregation 
should be called off, Marshall believes that the courts should push for greater 
integration and true equality between schools. 
</P>
<P>
But at age 82, Marshall -- the last of the court's old-fashioned liberals -- 
has few allies left. 
</P>
<P>
If Rehnquist can get the votes of his four fellow conservatives -- which 
appears likely -- the high court can be expected to issue a decision early next 
year that could free hundreds of school districts from judicial control. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department says that it has a role in nearly 500 still-pending 
court decrees involving school systems, most of them in the South and in border 
states. Civil rights attorneys say that they believe another 200 to 300 school 
districts still operate under federal court decrees. 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, school desegregation has faded as a national controversy, 
although busing and "magnet school" plans have continued quietly in many areas. 
The court decrees stayed in effect in part because the Supreme Court never said 
whether they could end. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, an appeals court in Denver ruled that the Oklahoma City school board 
may not end its desegregation plan. In that case, the school board said that it 
should be allowed to halt court-ordered busing and return to "neighborhood 
schools." Civil rights attorneys argued that such a plan would "re-segregate" 
the schools because blacks are concentrated in one section of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The same appeals court also ruled that the Topeka desegregation order should be 
kept in effect. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the Supreme Court heard arguments in the appeal of the Oklahoma 
City case. When the justices rule in that case (Board of Education vs. Dowell, 
89-1080), the decision also will govern the Topeka case and a third pending 
appeal from DeKalb County, Ga. In all three cases the basic issues are the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration entered the Oklahoma City case on behalf of the school 
boards. A brief clash between Justice Marshall and U.S. Solicitor Gen. Kenneth 
W. Starr highlighted the hearing. Starr, the Administration's top courtroom 
attorney, said that school boards should be freed from court control if they 
have fully complied with a busing order for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall objected. By "dismantling" the busing plan, "poor Afro-American kids" 
will be back in the same schools where they were before the court order, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Does it still stay a Negro school?" Marshall asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Not by virtue of state action," Starr replied. 
</P>
<P>
"But does it still remain a segregated school?" the justice asked again. 
</P>
<P>
"By virtue of residential segregation, it does," Starr conceded. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it's still a segregated school and you don't think segregation is 
unconstitutional," Marshall charged. 
</P>
<P>
"With all due respect, Justice Marshall, that is emphatically not our 
position," Starr countered. 
</P>
<P>
Starr and the school board attorneys argued that a concentration of black 
students that results from housing patterns is not the fault of the schools and 
need not be cured by school officials. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall and the civil rights attorneys countered that "residential 
segregation" is a "vestige" of the old system and, therefore, must be remedied 
by school officials. 
</P>
<P>
An examination of the Topeka school system shows both how things have changed 
and how they have stayed the same. 
</P>
<P>
In 1951, Oliver Brown was a lay minister and a welder for what was then known 
as the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad. He and his family lived just 
four blocks from Sumner School, a grand 1930s-era building with carved wood 
paneling and Art Deco styling. But it was reserved for white children. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's 10-year-old daughter Linda had to walk five blocks to a main street, 
then take a bus 20 blocks to the aging Monroe School, which was attended only 
by black students. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, 17 states, most of them in the South, required that black and 
white children be educated separately. Four others, including Kansas, permitted 
segregation by school boards. 
</P>
<P>
The Topeka lawsuit was one of five school cases before the Supreme Court in 
1953 when California Gov. Earl Warren was named chief justice. On May 17, 1954, 
Warren spoke for the court when it unanimously ruled that separate schools for 
black children are "inherently unequal." 
</P>
<P>
The decision was based on the 14th Amendment, which was enacted just after the 
Civil War to stop discrimination against blacks. It specifically prohibited 
states from denying any person "the equal protection of the laws." 
</P>
<P>
In the late 19th Century, however, the Supreme Court had nearly wiped this 
amendment from the books. It repeatedly upheld state laws that excluded blacks 
from schools, colleges, trains and boats so long as "separate but equal" 
accommodations were provided. 
</P>
<P>
The Brown decision reversed that doctrine. In response, the Topeka school board 
closed its four aging all-black schools and reassigned the pupils to 
neighborhood schools. Oliver Brown's younger daughter, Cheryl, attended the 
Sumner School which had excluded Linda. The junior high and high schools 
already were integrated. 
</P>
<P>
But the court decision did not change housing patterns. Less than one-fourth of 
Topeka's 122,000 residents are black, but they are concentrated on the east 
side of town. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Jones, a local civil rights attorney, revived the Brown case in 1979 
because black children still were concentrated in a handful of schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing much had changed," Jones said. "They have not eliminated the vestiges 
of segregation." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Topeka today has no "segregated" schools in the old-fashioned sense 
but neither are they fully integrated. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the northeast section of the city is an area of tiny white-frame 
homes that includes two subsidized housing projects. It is served by the 
Belvoir School, a cramped, one-story brick facility. Approximately 72% of its 
students are black or Latino, including Linda Brown Buckner's grandson. The 
school's test scores are among the city's lowest. 
</P>
<P>
The Whitson School is a 15-minute drive away on the other side of the city. It 
is in a neighborhood of solid brick homes and broad lawns. An immaculate, 
two-story school, Whitson has a top academic reputation. Fewer than 5% of its 
pupils are black. 
</P>
<P>
What happens next depends on the Supreme Court. If the justices turn down the 
school board's appeal, the district will be obliged to come up with a remedy 
for the racial imbalance between schools such as Belvoir and Whitson. 
</P>
<P>
If, however, Rehnquist's historic view prevails in the pending Oklahoma City 
case, the court would issue a brief order granting the Topeka school board's 
appeal and ordering that court control of the schools be ended. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the outcome, no one in Topeka, black or white, seems enthused 
about cross-town busing as a remedy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not discussed mandatory busing," said school Supt. Gary Livingston. 
"The debate should be about quality and equality of education, not just the 
dispersement of students." He added that the Topeka district "has consciously 
done more in resources and in support for the high-minority schools." 
</P>
<P>
Livingston said that the school system has used its federal funds to reduce 
class sizes in its predominantly black schools. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Brown Buckner, now a Head Start teacher, does not favor busing either. "I 
have a stigma about it because of what I went through. But I'd like to see them 
try magnet schools," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Others who have supported the continuing lawsuit say that it has succeeded in 
pushing the school district to hire more minority principals and to upgrade the 
curriculum in black schools. For example, Dale Cushinberry, the new principal 
at largely white Whitson, began his education in one of the all-black 
elementary schools before the Brown decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to keep the issue of school desegregation alive because we care 
about education," said Cheryl Brown Henderson, now an official in the Kansas 
State Department of Education. "It's not just a question of who sits next to 
you at school. We want educational equality."

BAKER HOPEFUL OF LAST-CHANCE TRIP TO BAGHDAD

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III expressed optimism Sunday that the United 
States and Iraq will settle their quarrel over dates in time for him to visit 
Baghdad for a last-chance attempt to avert war. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Baker told reporters traveling with him to a North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he is convinced that the American 
public and the world community will blame Iraq instead of the United States if 
proposed high-level contacts collapse in the dispute over a difference of only 
nine days. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope something can be arranged," Baker said when asked if he believes that 
the impasse will be broken. Iraq proposed Jan. 12 for Baker's visit to Baghdad, 
but President Bush said that any date after Jan. 3 is too close to the U.N. 
Security Council's deadline for Iraq to end its occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"We are offering any one of the following dates as a possible date for the 
meeting in Baghdad: Dec. 20, Dec. 21, Dec. 22, Dec. 23, Dec. 24, Dec. 25. . . 
," Baker said, slowly intoning every date between Dec. 20 and Jan. 3, including 
Christmas and New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official later told reporters aboard Baker's aircraft 
that the secretary of state would go to Iraq on Christmas Day if Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein asked him to do so, although he would much rather be 
at home on the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also refused to rule out a compromise date between Jan. 3 and Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
"It's customary and even traditional when you are talking about holding 
diplomatic discussions and meetings that the two sides should agree on when and 
where those meetings will be held," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the U.N. Security Council voted Nov. 29 to authorize the use of force to 
drive Iraq out of Kuwait, the 15-nation council fixed a deadline more than six 
weeks into the future to give diplomats a last chance to settle the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Since the U.N. vote, however, nothing much has happened on the diplomatic 
front, and the most dramatic initiative -- Bush's proposal for Iraqi Foreign 
Minister Tarik Aziz to come to Washington and Baker to visit Baghdad -- is in 
danger of falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there will be any additional attempts to find a peaceful solution, 
Baker said only, "Stay tuned." 
</P>
<P>
However, he rejected suggestions that Congress, the U.S. public and allied 
nations might question the U.S. resolve to "go the extra mile" in search of 
peace if the Aziz and Baker meetings are aborted over a narrow point of 
protocol. 
</P>
<P>
"We are being very forthcoming," Baker said. " . . . It does seem to me that 
people will understand that, so far at least, there is an effort on the part of 
the Iraqi government to manipulate the President's good-faith offer of 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"The international community has made it as clear as they can that they are 
serious about the authorization for the use of all necessary means (to force 
Iraq out of Kuwait)," he said. "There doesn't seem to me, at least, to have 
been any walking away from that or any suggestions by any members of the 
international coalition than the (U.N.) resolution meant something other than 
specifically what it said." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he plans to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis with the foreign 
ministers of the 15 other NATO countries during the alliance's annual winter 
meeting today and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike special NATO meetings earlier in the crisis, Baker said he will not make 
any new requests for the allies to increase their military or financial 
contributions to the anti-Iraq coalition, although he will remind the foreign 
ministers that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney recently asked NATO defense 
ministers to provide additional ships and aircraft to transport troops and 
materiel to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also said the NATO ministers will discuss accusations that the Soviet 
Union has tried to cheat on the recently signed Conventional Forces in Europe 
Treaty by undercounting the tanks, artillery and combat aircraft that are 
stationed in Europe. He said the meeting also will consider charges that Moscow 
has tried to evade the treaty by moving some tanks and other weapons into 
Soviet Asia, which is not covered by the agreement, although he said this 
action apparently is not a technical violation of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
On a related subject, Baker said the United States has warned the Soviets that 
if they use police repression to prevent "the emergence of rudimentary markets" 
in the country's crumbling planned economy, it would reverse the warming trend 
in U.S.-Soviet relations. However, he said Washington has no objection to 
enforcement of "reasonable laws." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to elaborate, he said the United States objects to the use of police 
power to prevent farmers from holding their produce off the market in hopes of 
a better price because such behavior is driven by market factors even though it 
technically violates Soviet law. But he said it would be appropriate for Soviet 
police to crack down on hijacking and theft. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made the determination that instability in the Soviet Union is not in 
our interest nor in the interest of the world," he said. "We want to see the 
reform process continue. We take note of the degree to which it proceeded with 
a great deal more rapidity than anyone thought was possible. We take note that 
the central authorities in the Soviet Union meant it when they said they would 
not use force to prevent Central and Eastern Europe from reforming."

5 RECONSTRUCTION PLANS FOR COLISEUM PRODUCED; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: IT WILL BE MORE THAN A RENOVATION. PROPOSALS MAKE IT CLEAR IT 
WILL BE A FAR DIFFERENT PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After several days of work, a team of 13 prominent architects, engineers and 
historic preservationists from around the country has produced five alternative 
plans for reconstructing the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
All of the plans lower the playing field, bring thousands of seats closer to 
the action, provide for luxury boxes and elite club seating, maintain or 
augment the stadium's famous tunnels and retain both the historic eastern 
peristyle and the exterior walls. 
</P>
<P>
But the plans make clearer than ever that the new Coliseum -- now a national 
historic landmark as the only stadium to host two of the modern Olympic Games 
-- is going to be a far different place. 
</P>
<P>
It will truly be reconstructed and not just renovated. No matter where the 
boxes are placed, on the rim or between new decks of seats, the facility will 
have a substantially reduced seating capacity and a far different interior 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
Its major scoreboards may be moved from the columned peristyle to the west end. 
The number of seats in the west end is apt to be greatly reduced. Front-row 
seats are likely to be vertically separated from the field for the first time. 
In one of the alternatives, the boxes would be constructed on top of an 
entirely new structure built outside the present walls. 
</P>
<P>
The alternatives developed during the four-day workshop, sponsored by an 
unusual coalition -- the Coliseum Commission; the Spectacor Limited 
Partnership, financiers and builders of the new stadium; the Los Angeles 
Conservancy, a leading preservationist group; and the office of Mayor Tom 
Bradley -- are only the beginning of the design work. 
</P>
<P>
The alternatives vary sharply, mostly in the placement of the boxes, the 
lowering of some seats, the establishment of new sight lines and seating tiers, 
and the plans for providing new service concourses. 
</P>
<P>
But even more radical changes may be incorporated in the final official plan, 
expected in four to six months from the Kansas City architectural firm of HNTB. 
Three of the firm's leading designers participated in developing the 
alternatives released here late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Also emerging from the workshop was the likelihood of a longer construction 
period than officials had indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Work cannot begin until the expected yearlong process of preparing an 
environmental impact report is complete. A public hearing on the scope of the 
environmental study is scheduled for the Sports Arena on Tuesday at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In their 65-page report, the designers estimated actual construction would take 
27 months, making it plain that the Coliseum's prime tenants, the Los Angeles 
Raiders and USC football teams, will have to find somewhere else to play for 
two seasons, not just one. 
</P>
<P>
The time frame also makes it uncertain whether the new Coliseum will be ready 
to host World Cup soccer matches in 1994, as Bradley and others organizing a 
Los Angeles bid for the finals and semifinals have hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Coliseum Commission Chairman Matthew Grossman said at the end of the workshop 
that it may not be possible to begin construction until early 1993, which would 
rule out the Coliseum for World Cup use. Even if construction were to start in 
early 1992, it would be difficult to have the stadium ready in time, especially 
since one of the HNTB designers estimated construction could take 36 months. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the Coliseum would not rule out a Los Angeles area World Cup bid, 
but it would have to focus on the Rose Bowl, instead of offering both the Rose 
Bowl and the Coliseum to the international soccer federation as had been 
contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
As last week's design sessions began, workshop leader Michael John Pittas, 
formerly a Harvard faculty member and chief of comprehensive planning for New 
York City, described the goal. 
</P>
<P>
"Our work here is to find the middle ground between historic preservation and 
building a state-of-the-art modern facility," he said. "We are generating 
alternatives, not providing optimum solutions. We have to be sensitive to a 
range of concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Among the experts paid to come to Los Angeles to participate were Frank E. 
Sanchis III, lead architect with the National Trust for Historical 
Preservation; Michael Kwartler, director of Columbia University's Program in 
Historic Preservation; Walter P. Moore, a Houston civil engineer, and George 
Loschky, chief architect of Seattle's Kingdome. Among the Angelenos joining 
them were structural engineer John Kariotis and architects Francisco Behr, 
Craig Hodgetts and William Ellinger. 
</P>
<P>
Loschky and others said from the outset that while Coliseum preservationists' 
concerns in recent years have centered on retaining the peristyle and the 
exterior walls, retaining the basic arrangement of the Coliseum's inner space 
and its tunnels may be just as important. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they noted, there are no abrupt differences, row by row, in the quality of 
seats in the Coliseum. When club seats and luxury boxes are installed, that 
will no longer be true; there will be distinct class differences between people 
occupying adjacent rows of seats. 
</P>
<P>
"The present oneness of the spectator group, the democratic character of the 
Coliseum, is a prime issue," said Loschky. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Harris, dean of the USC School of Architecture, contended that retaining 
the tunnels in the new facility would be essential. "Coming through the tunnels 
into an extraordinary new place would actually augment our sense of history," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges between those being interviewed and the experts made evident many 
strong, widely varying opinions, about what the new stadium should be like. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Deputy Los Angeles Police Chief William Rathburn, long 
responsible for Coliseum security, expressed concern that in an earthquake or 
other disaster requiring evacuation, the tunnels would prove dangerous. He said 
he has long been concerned that stampedes there could result in fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
Raiders attorney Amy Trask said: "We want an intimate facility where our team 
can hear and play to the roar of the crowd and where the fans can feel they're 
part of the action. We don't have that now. . . . We cannot overemphasize how 
vital intimacy is to the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, USC Athletic Director Mike McGee said the school's focus is 
on well-placed club seating, where the school can continue to sell the best 
viewing at premium prices to loyal alumni who are supporting its scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Raiders and USC representatives stressed the importance of increasing 
the number of seats between the goal posts on either side of the field, noting 
that these seats total only 22,000 now. The Raiders said they wanted a seating 
capacity of 65,000 to 70,000; USC said it would prefer 72,000, temporarily 
expandable to 85,000 for USC's big games. 
</P>
<P>
Christy McAvoy, a member of the historic resources group of the Los Angeles 
Conservancy, said she recognized that "the guts of this building have to be 
renovated," but she pleaded with the designers not to construct any boxes or 
other seating that would rise above the perimeter of the present stadium. 
</P>
<P>
As the alternatives were developed, it became evident that not all desired 
features could be incorporated within any of them. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the alternatives, for example, manages to boost the number of seats 
between the goal posts to 50% of the total, or about 35,000, as the teams want. 
Three of the alternatives do raise structures above the present perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
Some alternatives are considerably more costly than others, although no figures 
were given by the experts. Coliseum authorities have talked of budgeting $145 
million for the reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
Although the emphasis of the workshop was on retaining the historic elements of 
the present Coliseum, both an official of the U.S. National Park Service and 
the chairman of the State Historic Building and Safety Board told the workshop 
participants that there is no authority by their agencies to actually block 
demolition of such features. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Dishman, the representative of the National Park Service, said, for 
instance, that the most punitive action the Service could take would be to 
withdraw the national historic landmark designation if too little of the old 
Coliseum were left standing. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, if federal authorities were satisfied that historic elements 
were retained, the buildings of the new Coliseum might qualify for a 20% tax 
writeoff. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOME POSSIBLE NEW ANGLES ON THE COLISEUM 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum, built from 1921 to 1923 and expanded for the 1932 Olympics, has a 
seating capacity of 92,516. Its comparatively shallow bowl, and large spaces 
between field and seats, is said to make it a poorer place to watch football 
than the stadiums listed below. The seating and the space profile of each of 
these stadiums, superimposed on the profiles of the Coliseum, show how fans in 
the other stadiums are closer to the field and watching from a steeper angle 
than Coliseum fans. All of the other stadiums also have luxury boxes, which the 
Coliseum does not. 
</P>
<P>
ARROWHEAD STADIUM 
</P>
<P>
This Kansas City stadium was completed in 1968 and has a seating capacity of 
78,097. 
</P>
<P>
MILE HIGH STADIUM 
</P>
<P>
This Denver stadium was expanded to its present capacity in 1977. It seats 
76,123. 
</P>
<P>
JOE ROBBIE STADIUM 
</P>
<P>
This stadium, outside Miami, was competed in 1987 and has a capacity of 75,000. 
</P>
<P>
TEXAS STADIUM 
</P>
<P>
This stadium, at Irving, outside Dallas, has permanent seating for 63,855 and 
can be expanded with temporary seating to 73,855.

BUSINESS: WHEN BART'S SHOP CLOSES FOR THE DAY, SOME OF THE MERCHANDISE REMAINS 
AVAILABLE OUTSIDE ON THE HONOR SYSTEM.

<P>
Bart's Books in Ojai believes in doing business on the honor system. 
</P>
<P>
When the store is closed, customers may still buy books from a dozen four-shelf 
bookcases mounted on outside walls. 
</P>
<P>
The honor system is in effect all day on Mondays and every night of the week 
from the time the store closes at 5:30 p.m. until it reopens the next day at 10 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
And very few of the bookstore's customers ever abuse their privileges and 
neglect to drop their money into the box sitting outside. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel good about it," said bookstore owner Gary Schlichter, 56. "It's a 
tradition going on since the store opened 26 years ago. Very seldom does 
someone take a book without paying. 
</P>
<P>
"It restores your faith in humanity," Schlichter added. 
</P>
<P>
The outside shelves are always stacked with about 1,000 used books -- 
paperbacks, hardbacks, a mix of fiction and nonfiction -- all selling from 15 
cents to 50 cents. Prices are marked on each book. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a person lacks the correct change or leaves an IOU. They'll come in 
when the store is open and say: 'Here's the money I owe you,' " said 
Schlichter. 
</P>
<P>
People on foot, bicycle, horseback, in cars and trucks patronize the store 
after hours. 
</P>
<P>
"If the overhead lights aren't strong enough for them, they will often use 
vehicle headlights or flashlights to help read the titles or browse," 
Schlichter said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart's Books is a bookstore that makes everybody feel good and proud of their 
hometown. It speaks very well for Ojai and the basic honesty of people who live 
here," said Ojai's mayor, Nina Shelley, 69. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai, population 7,000, is a picturesque Ventura County town with quaint shops 
and popular restaurants. Located in a valley rimmed by the Los Padres National 
Forest, it is home to many writers and artists. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents say they point out the bookstore to potential home buyers, 
citing it as an example of Ojai's small-town style. The image, they say, helps 
sell houses. 
</P>
<P>
"I drive my clients by Bart's and describe the honor system. . . . They are in 
awe," said Goldena Stallings, a real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Randolph, 53, the store's assistant manager, said out-of-towners 
constantly tell him that the system would never work where they live, that the 
books would be cleaned out overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all curious about what happens when it rains. The shelves have a large 
overhang and the books are fairly well protected. We may lose a few in a 
driving rainstorm but it doesn't happen very often," Randolph said. 
</P>
<P>
The bookstore is housed in a 55-year old home, two garages and a large patio 
jammed with shelves containing more than 100,000 used books. 
</P>
<P>
Books are arranged by topic, from travel to the occult. The kitchen of the 
house is full of cookbooks. Hallways have travel books. History is in a garage. 
</P>
<P>
The books come from estate and library sales as well as from individuals who 
bring boxes and shopping bags full of volumes to sell or trade. Many of the 
contributions come from people who are moving or cleaning out a house. 
</P>
<P>
People from all over Southern California find their way to Bart's. 
</P>
<P>
Lilibeth Bishop, 31, of Malibu, a writer for Women's Journal, a popular 
Philippines weekly, told how she looked all over the Los Angeles area for 
"Elmer Gantry" and "It Can't Happen Here," two Sinclair Lewis books long out of 
print. 
</P>
<P>
She found them at Bart's. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can't find a book anywhere else, chances are you will find it here," 
she said.

MILITARY ENLISTEES RETREAT AS CHANCES OF WAR INCREASE; 
</P>
<P>
SERVICE: THE NUMBER OF ENLISTMENTS HAS SLACKENED SINCE OPERATION DESERT SHIELD 
BEGAN. RECRUITERS ARE NOT MEETING THEIR QUOTAS AND SOME ARE CHANGING TACTICS.

Christopher Acosta wanted to join the Navy, but after the crisis in the Middle 
East heated up he changed his mind. So did his parents. Do not go until the 
conflict cools, they told their 17-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see fighting over oil," said Acosta, a high school senior in 
Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
In the months since Operation Desert Shield began, military recruiters have 
been having a difficult time wooing applicants, so much so that at least one 
branch of the service -- the Army -- has decided to give bonuses to recruiters 
for finding enlistees with particular specialties. And recruiters have resorted 
to more creative tactics to meet their quotas. 
</P>
<P>
Although military officials acknowledge their recruitment efforts are off, they 
are less than certain that tensions in the Middle East are the cause. 
</P>
<P>
"Recruiting is harder -- it would be foolish to say it isn't," said Vice Adm. 
Jeremy Boorda, chief of naval personnel and deputy chief of naval operations in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But, added Pentagon spokesman Maj. Doug Hart: "It's hard to say if Operation 
Desert Shield has had an effect. Recruiters are meeting their goals." 
</P>
<P>
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, Navy recruiting has slowed. In November, Navy 
recruiters missed their quota by 27% when they signed up 4,547 new recruits. 
During the same month, Army recruiting dipped 23% when 5,488 new recruits 
volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
In the Army, the decline in contracts signed by new recruits began in September 
when officials sought 8,371 and obtained 6,503 -- a 22% drop. In the next two 
months, the drop-off persisted. In October, Army officials sought 10,039 but 
found only 8,237 new recruits. 
</P>
<P>
So far, slowdowns in recruiting have had little impact because the Navy and 
other branches of the armed forces can dip into manpower "bank accounts" and 
call up deferred recruits, Boorda said. He and Hart said the military suffers 
no deficit in able-bodied, qualified recruits, especially since Congress asked 
the armed forces to reduce their numbers by 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
But critics argue that the Pentagon is scrambling to hide the fact that 
potential enlistees are shying away from possible participation in a war. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot discount the clear indications that the growing prospects of war in 
the Middle East are having a negative effect on volunteer enlistment. The young 
are saying, 'This is not my war,' " said retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll, a 
former assistant chief of naval personnel in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"To say that the military is continuing to meet monthly accessions because of 
delayed entry recruits is a natural cover-up, " said Carroll, deputy director 
of the Center for Defense Information. "They are going to fall behind -- and 
they are trying to avoid the bad publicity that will slow down recruiting even 
further. If you've got a dog at the box office, you don't advertise that you 
have unsold tickets." 
</P>
<P>
For recruiters in Southern California, the sting of Operation Desert Shield is 
sharp. They say some parents, like the Acostas, are voicing concerns and 
stopping their children from enlisting. Most potential recruits ask whether 
they will be sent to the gulf, and the longstanding selling point about 
learning a skill is not as effective today as it was before August. 
</P>
<P>
For Chris Acosta and others, the danger of combat outweighs the military's 
allure. Acosta wanted to enlist for typical reasons -- the chance for 
adventure, travel and educational benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"This Middle East thing really scared me," he said. "I didn't want to take the 
chance that they would put me out on a boat in the gulf." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he started working part time in the fish department of a pet shop to 
save money for next year, when he hopes to attend a local college. 
</P>
<P>
Denise Acosta Stringfield, his mother, said the family had many discussions 
about whether Chris should enlist. Stringfield's father had served 20 years -- 
including two tours in Vietnam -- as a Marine. Describing herself as 
pro-military, Stringfield, 34, says she had very mixed feelings about her son's 
dilemma. In the end, she let Chris decide. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though we may not go to war, a lot of young men are dying, more than 50 
so far. It just hit me that Chris could be killed, my son could be killed," 
said Stringfield, a customer service sales representative. "He's only 17 -- 
he's still pretty young. He's got plenty of time to enlist." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis, Pentagon officials have no plans to 
alter their $2-billion annual recruiting campaign to lure more enlistees, 
spokesman Hart said. But to help recruiters attract enlistees, the Army 
established $2,000 bonuses for positions such as water treatment specialists 
that have been difficult to fill during recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Some recruiters are changing their approach. Sgt. 1st Class Dave Eisenbarth, an 
Army recruiter in Simi Valley, has given up on cold calls to youngsters' homes, 
a standard recruiting method. Instead, he frequents shopping malls in hopes of 
finding potential enlistees. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than having interested youngsters come to his office, Eisenbarth now 
sets up meetings in their homes -- hoping to also chat with parents. In this 
way, he tries to short-circuit what seems to be an inevitable volley of 
questions that parents fire when they learn their children have seen a 
recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
Other recruiters note some unforeseen burdens caused by Operation Desert 
Shield. When Marine Corps Sgt. Joe Steele visits schools, he can no longer 
bring light armored vehicles -- one of the Marines' most popular calling cards. 
Most of the eight-wheeled Jeeps, which travel water and land, have been shipped 
to the Middle East, along with the men who drive them. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters were allowed to climb into the vehicles and their absence is a loss, 
said Steele of the San Diego Marine Corps Recruiting Station, which includes 
San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Imperial counties. To compensate, he 
is trying to arrange for historical displays of older equipment. It won't be 
quite the same, he acknowledges, but it beats just handing out pencils, 
stickers and posters. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, recruiters are facing numbers of applicants who want to know 
where they will be stationed. Selling what could turn into a war is not easy -- 
even if most new recruits would not be eligible to be shipped out of the 
country for at least four months. 
</P>
<P>
"It means we need to talk to more people. We are selling a way of life; not a 
job. . . . We are selling money, educational benefits, adventure and travel. 
But some parents say they would just as soon not have a son or daughter in the 
Army right now," said Lt. Col. Richard Holmes of the Army's Los Angeles 
recruiting battalion, a region that stretches from Santa Ana to Paso Robles. In 
that area, Holmes said, recruiters have been able to meet their monthly quota 
of 300. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting rates vary from region to region and from branch to branch of the 
armed services. Holmes and others explain that this often has to do with the 
area's economy and the strength of its recruiting staff. Recruiting rates can 
also vary from month to month. 
</P>
<P>
In the area reaching from San Diego to Barstow to Las Vegas, Navy recruiters 
met their goals in October and missed their mark slightly in November. But in 
September, they fell far short of their goal of obtaining 228 new enlistees 
when they recruited 106 -- about a third of what they recruited the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I really get frustrated when I invest so much time, when I talk with an 
individual and he is ready to go for it. Then it comes down to taking the 
physical and he says, 'I am not going, I am afraid,' " sighed Petty Officer 
H.L. Scott, recruiter-in-charge at the Navy recruiting station in Escondido. 
"Desert Shield has had an impact, everybody knows that."

MUCH ADO: Grove Shakespeare Festival staffers are wearing trumpet label pins 
nowadays as subtle political comment. 
</P>
<P>
It all started when a former Garden Grove councilman who voted against funds 
for the troupe said Shakespeare isn't part of American culture. A major donor 
retorted that a trumpet should sound at each councilman's Shakespearean 
reference. . . . The council hasn't budged an inch ("The Taming of the Shrew"), 
but there is something in the wind ("The Comedy of Errors"). Tonight the 
festival will ask that its lease be relaxed and intends to fight till the last 
gasp ("King Henry the Sixth, Part I"). Lily Eng and Jan Herman

<P>
Thousands of Romanians returned Sunday to the scene of their daring stand 
against tyranny a year ago, not to celebrate the revolution that ousted Eastern 
Europe's most depraved dictator but to mourn its failure to ease their 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters raising paper torches and lighted candles converged on Opera Square 
in an eerie evening vigil to remember the revolution's martyrs and to denounce 
the new Romanian government as little improvement over the one that was toppled 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
The daylong event swelled at times to include as many as 10,000 people taking 
part in flag waving, chanting of anti-government slogans and denunciation of 
President Ion Iliescu. 
</P>
<P>
Shouts of "Resign!" and "Down with Iliescu!" echoed through the dark, muddy 
streets, along with demands for a convertible currency and reforms that will 
put food back on store shelves and turn up the heat in dilapidated urban homes. 
</P>
<P>
Police stood by quietly at crowd-control barriers but made no effort to 
interfere with the rally, called by opposition forces in remembrance of those 
who fell in the fight against repression. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers addressing the assemblage from a second-floor balcony of the 
Opera House called on the crowd to kneel in the icy remnants of a recent 
snowfall to pray for the souls of those who died to bring democracy to Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Huge crowds commemorating last year's uprising were also reported in several 
other Romanian cities. In Bucharest, 2,000 protesters marched through the 
streets Sunday accusing the government of betraying Romanians' hopes for 
freedom and prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Anniversary demonstrations had been expected to continue throughout the month, 
marking last year's tumult that culminated in the capture and execution on 
Christmas Day of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his hated wife, Elena. 
</P>
<P>
But leaders of the recently fortified opposition in Parliament and the Civic 
Alliance movement have appealed for calm and called off many public gatherings 
for fear they could erupt in violence. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's protest in this birthplace of the revolution was the venting of 
pent-up frustration with a repressive system that seems to have remained 
despite the death of its chief architect. 
</P>
<P>
"Our revolution has been confiscated," lamented Simona Martin, a 28-year-old 
manufacturing worker from the town of Lugos. She said she had rushed to 
Timisoara a year ago when word that protesters had been fired on spread 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
"All the people on this square think as I do, that none of what we fought for 
has happened. It's very sad," she said. "But we know we are a minority. We are 
probably no more than 20%." 
</P>
<P>
It was in Timisoara on Dec. 16, 1989, that long-simmering resentment of 
deprivation escalated into an anti-Communist revolt that drove out Ceausescu in 
less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
The spark for that revolution was Bucharest's persecution of Laszlo Tokes, a 
popular ethnic Hungarian pastor based in Timisoara. Violent clashes broke out 
between demonstrators who gathered at Tokes' house and soldiers called in to 
quell the spreading unrest. Inflated reports of deaths in the tens of thousands 
sent shock waves of horror through the nation, fanning anger into full-fledged 
revolt. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 Romanians died in the struggle to oust Ceausescu, fighting 
bloody clashes with die-hard enforcers of the Securitate secret police who 
defended the dictator to the end. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu, once a high-ranking Communist before falling out of favor with 
Ceausescu in the early 1970s, came to the political fore after the revolution 
to create the National Salvation Front and head an interim government. Iliescu 
won resounding endorsement as president in national elections on May 20, and 
the front captured two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The front rode to victory on the strength of its support among the peasantry 
and fears among factory workers that their jobs were at risk if they voted for 
a more radical approach to rebuilding the country's devastated economy. 
</P>
<P>
But living conditions remained pitiful, and a sudden change in reform tactics 
by the government of Prime Minister Petre Roman has alienated many of those 
Romanians who thought they were gaining security by voting for the front. 
</P>
<P>
Disenchantment with the gains of the revolution has been feeding a wave of 
anti-government protests and strikes that Front opponents hope will topple the 
Bucharest leadership in the same way that unrest forced Communists from power 
in neighboring Bulgaria last month. 
</P>
<P>
Union representatives in Timisoara said 50,000 workers from 11 factories were 
striking on Saturday, and the numbers were expected to grow once business 
resumes today. Pilots and navigators with the national airline, Tarom, have 
also joined the protest action, idling much of the fleet and raising prospects 
of a military takeover of air transport. 
</P>
<P>
The government has also been fighting against calls for a nationwide general 
strike to protest price rises and poor supplies of heat and electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the broadening movement against his leadership, Iliescu 
agreed to negotiate today with Radu Campeanu, head of the National Liberal 
Party and one of the opposition figures who challenged Iliescu for the 
presidency in May. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the meeting has fueled speculation that Campeanu, who heads a 
new coalition of opposition parties in Parliament, may gain a top government 
post. 
</P>
<P>
By bringing in Campeanu and other opposition leaders, the front could appease 
some of the political factions that have so far refused to work with the 
government to improve living standards. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to address the opposition's concerns could ignite a second revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"The refusal of the current compromised leadership to relinquish power could 
generate an uncontrollable explosion of discontent," warned a statement issued 
by Civic Alliance, an increasingly influential union of opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Alliance ended a three-day conference in Bucharest over the weekend with 
an appeal for early elections and a "government we can trust" in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
Marian Munteanu, a student leader who was badly beaten in June when Iliescu 
summoned vigilantes to put down anti-government protests, said Civic Alliance 
was holding off on calling for any further demonstrations for fear of violence. 
</P>
<P>
"We know there are irresponsible people in this country who may want to turn it 
into a blood bath," Munteanu said. 
</P>
<P>
Tokes, the Hungarian pastor whose plight inflamed the revolt a year ago, 
appealed to fellow anti-government protesters to continue "to sweep away the 
old structures" while renouncing violence. 
</P>
<P>
"My advice would be to be calm and to fight by political means. Don't let 
yourself be provoked," he cautioned protesters on the eve of the anniversary 
observances. 
</P>
<P>
At an ecumenical service outside his church, Tokes called for "a second 
revolution -- a revolution of human rights, of dignity, but without bloodshed."

QUITTING TIME: An empty chair at the Cabinet table and the opening for the top 
job at the Republican National Committee are not the only major vacancies 
President Bush is facing as his Administration reaches the traditional midterm 
exit point. 
</P>
<P>
Within the White House, for example, James Cicconi, a top Bush aide and a 
protege of Secretary of State James A. Baker III, is leaving to return to the 
Washington law office headed by power-broker Robert Strauss. And Constance B. 
Newman, who heads the Office of Personnel Management, the government's 
personnel department, also plans to resign, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Their departures could have notable impact on policy, particularly in the area 
of civil rights. Newman, who is black, and Cicconi played key roles in efforts 
to avoid a veto of civil rights legislation successfully opposed by 
Administration conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
The open Cabinet position is secretary of education. 
</P>
<P>
QUITTING COLD TURKEY: Counselors who help people stop smoking say that 
motivation is always one of the biggest factors in success at kicking the 
habit. Alixe Glen, a deputy White House press secretary, has found a powerful 
motivation tool. 
</P>
<P>
She was all set to take a job as assistant secretary for public affairs at the 
Department of Health and Human Services. Then a reporter called an HHS official 
to ask whether Glen planned to quit her pack-a-day habit. Secretary Louis W. 
Sullivan, who has made opposition to cigarette smoking a major crusade, 
promptly called Glen at the White House. "This is a serious problem," he told 
her. 
</P>
<P>
"My last day at the White House I smoked my last cigarette" the now smoke-free 
Glen reports. 
</P>
<P>
CONFUSION REIGNS: Five weeks of hearings into the "Keating Five" scandal have 
brought members of the Senate Ethics Committee no closer to a consensus on the 
guilt or innocence of the five senators charged with improperly assisting 
former Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the hearings appear to have deepened the partisan division of the 
six-member committee. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's three Democrats are said to find no fault with the conduct of any 
of the five senators, with the possible exception of Sen. Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
The three Republican members, however, are understood to be much less willing 
to dismiss the allegations against the other four. 
</P>
<P>
When the hearings end next month, according to sources, the committee is likely 
to go along with special counsel Robert S. Bennett's recommendation that the 
charges against John McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (R-Ohio) be dismissed, but 
no one involved in the investigation has the vaguest idea how the panel will 
resolve its differences over the conduct of Cranston, Dennis DeConcini 
(D-Ariz.) or Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
COP SUMMIT: Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, seeking to gain control of runaway 
violent crime, will convene a law enforcement summit in early February, 
inviting more than 300 police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, academic experts 
and top federal cops to Washington. In addition to sharing information on 
crime-busting techniques, the law officers. will be asked to support some of 
the Bush Administration's favorite get-tough remedies that were stripped at the 
last minute from a comprehensive crime bill passed by Congress this year. The 
hard-line measures include a proposal to expand use of the federal death 
penalty.

AMERICAN ALBUM: HOLIDAY CAROLERS SING A TUNE TO THE TURTLEDOVES; 
</P>
<P>
ZOO VOLUNTEERS BEGAN THE TRADITION 14 YEARS AGO. THIS YEAR 7,000 PEOPLE 
SERENADED THE ANIMALS.

<P>
Dr. Dolittle would have been proud. 
</P>
<P>
"Deck the hall with boughs of holly," sang 9-year-old Christopher Jett, huddled 
around the sea lion pool at the Lincoln Park Zoo the other day. "Fa la la la 
la, la la la la." 
</P>
<P>
It's a precious Christmas image: Cherub-faced youngsters strolling down 
snow-covered streets, serenading families that flock to their doorsteps bearing 
warm cider and cookies. Try that in most big cities today and you're liable to 
get mugged or chased down the block by the neighborhood watch. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Chicago, however, the great yuletide custom lives on, albeit with a 
twist. Carolers don't sing to people anymore. They sing to animals. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, a few Sundays before Christmas, throngs of Chicagoans gather to 
warble a message of Peace on Earth, Good Will Toward Mammals to the lions, 
gazelles, elephants, giraffes, hedgehogs, armadillos, iguanas, turtles, 
turtledoves, partridges and all the other species on display at the 35-acre 
urban animal park just north of The Loop. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not supposed to anthropomorphize, but I think they love it," insisted 
Carol Leifer, a zoo spokesperson. " . . . I have seen spectacled bears swaying 
to the music." 
</P>
<P>
Little Christopher had no idea that "anthropomorphize" meant to attribute human 
characteristics to animals. He just knew that singing to animals in a cage was 
a lot more fun than doing it at home. "I tried singing to my cat but he 
scratched me," Christopher explained. 
</P>
<P>
Caroling to the animals began here 14 years ago when a handful of volunteer zoo 
workers did it on a lark. Over the years, the popularity has mushroomed to the 
point where it has probably become the city's most widely attended Christmas 
event. More than 7,000 people took part this year. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with tradition, everyone assembled first around the outdoor sea lion 
pool where Santa, sometimes known as Ron Solomon (remember, it's a tradition 
with a twist), arrived toting his satchel full of mackerel and herring. He 
tossed the fish into the pool, where Junior, the 800-pound major-domo of the 
water, and the rest of his pals merrily munched away to the strains of "O Come 
All Ye Faithful." 
</P>
<P>
From there, the choristers broke up according to animal preference. Some headed 
over to the lion house, some to the children's zoo, some to the large mammal 
area, and, yes, some to the reptile exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stand snakes," admitted Eryl Morgan, nervously turning her back to a 
reticulated python as she belted out a verse of "Jolly Old St. Nicholas." "But 
I can't see any of them with all these people in here. Besides, I'm not really 
singing to them. I'm singing to a plate of glass." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan might not have been crooning to the snakes, but the snakes might have 
been thinking otherwise. Clarence Wright, the curator of the reptile house, 
said snakes have ultra sensitive lower jaws and scales and probably pick up 
vibrations from the music. 
</P>
<P>
"It really doesn't bother them, but they're just aware of it more (than normal 
crowd noise)," he explained. "They're probably moving around a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
Experts are unsure how much other animals appreciate the musical interlude. "It 
certainly doesn't distress them," said Steve Thompson, the zoo's director of 
conservation of science. "Either they see it as 'just those silly humans again' 
or they may actually enjoy it. It's hard to tell." 
</P>
<P>
Some carolers swear that when they start singing en masse, lions roar back, sea 
lions bark and even snakes flick their tongues in time to the music. 
</P>
<P>
While the motivation behind such actions is open to debate, senior lion keeper 
Art Maraldi said he has noticed that big cats seem to enjoy classical music and 
jazz. Once, he said, the lions started "roaring like crazy" when a brass 
ensemble played outside their cages. 
</P>
<P>
As for Christmas carols, Maraldi said the cats could probably take them or 
leave them. When the singing began, leopards, jaguars and other cats did begin 
pacing back and forth anxiously. But Maraldi said such nervous behavior 
probably had less to do with the sound than the sight of hundreds of sumptuous 
looking youngsters massed tantalizingly just a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"They react to the little size of the children," he explained. "The children 
are just the right size to eat."

Rejecting U.S. opposition to the planned deportation of four Arabs, Arens said,

deportations. Israel renewed its deportation policy in hopes of ending a wave

Housing Secretary Jack Kemp predicted Sunday that the Bush Administration will 
find a way to preserve minority-only scholarships that are linked to students' 
financial needs. 
</P>
<P>
The White House and Justice Department are reviewing a controversial opinion 
from the Education Department's top civil rights official that cast doubt on 
the legality of race-based scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp, speaking on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," said: "Like most Americans, I 
don't believe in race-based or religious-based quotas." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "I do believe in affirmative efforts by colleges to open up 
opportunity to minorities and low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a mistake for the federal government to shut off federal aid to a 
college . . . because it's trying to promote opportunities for minorities based 
on need and minority status." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute, which has upset many college administrators and civil rights 
groups, was triggered by an opinion circulated by Michael Williams, the 
assistant education secretary for civil rights, that federal law bars college 
scholarships predicated only on race. He warned colleges could lose their 
eligibility for federal aid if they gave such scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
But Kemp said Williams' interpretation of the law did not rule out scholarships 
based on race as well as financial need.

CHRISTMAS TREE FIRE BURNS GIRL, 6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 6-year-old girl was critically burned Sunday when fire, fed by the family 
Christmas tree, swept through an apartment in the Jordan Downs Housing Project 
in Watts, and firefighters rescued five others trapped by the blaze, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A man in the apartment was also burned and listed in critical condition at 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
/Drew Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer who helped rescue the six people in the apartment suffered 
smoke inhalation and minor burns and was taken to the hospital, police said. 
Another officer was treated for smoke inhalation and released. None of of the 
injured was identified. 
</P>
<P>
The fire appears to have started in a living room couch in the two-story 
apartment and spread to the Christmas tree, Los Angeles City Fire Department 
spokesman Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
The six people in the apartment included the injured man, three teen-agers, the 
burned girl and another child, Wells said. Firefighters and police officers 
carried them from the building through a window on the second floor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire at 2148 E. 97th St. began at 5:20 p.m., and firefighters extinguished 
it 20 minutes later, Wells said. He estimated damage at $8,000 to the building 
and $5,000 to contents. 
</P>
<P>
The exact cause was under investigation.

MATCH GAME FRUSTRATES OFFICERS

Arthur L. (Larry) Kagele enjoys solving puzzles in his off-hours. 
</P>
<P>
It is the ones he tries to put together on the job that often make him want to 
tear out his hair. 
</P>
<P>
Kagele is among six detectives assigned to the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Pawn Detail, which regulates the city's 63 licensed pawnbrokers and more than 
2,500 second-hand stores and antique dealers. One need look no further than 
Kagele's desk at Parker Center to understand the frustrations of his job. 
</P>
<P>
On one side are stacked hundreds of burglary and theft reports taken citywide. 
On the other is a plastic shopping bag stuffed with hundreds of pawn tickets 
that Kagele picks up daily from the half-dozen shops he patrols. 
</P>
<P>
For hours, Kagele thumbs through the theft reports, then the pawn tickets, 
trying to match items stolen with items hocked. To their credit, Kagele and 
others assigned to the squad last year recovered more than $1 million in stolen 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Their mind-numbing task, however, is rarely fruitful: Fewer than one out of 
every 100 pawn tickets Kagele studies yields a stolen item. 
</P>
<P>
"There are thousands of pieces of jewelry out there, hundreds of televisions," 
he said, "and all these people calling wanting to know if we've found their 
things yet." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the work is by hand. Identification numbers of stolen and pawned items 
are fed each day into computers in hopes of matching them. The problem, Kagele 
said, is that most victims never bother to put personal identification numbers 
on their possessions, so a computer is useless in the majority of cases. 
</P>
<P>
The typical theft reports describing a missing "20-inch television set" or 
"10-speed bicycle" get little more than a quick glance before landing in 
Kagele's trash can. 
</P>
<P>
Kagele tries to concentrate on the unusual items. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a guy in a wheelchair once and I got him back the pendant that 
belonged to his father," he said proudly. "There were tears in his eyes. It was 
very satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
To some, the way Kagele and others in the Pawn Detail earn their paychecks may 
seem a waste of time and resources, particularly in a city where officers are 
hard pressed to investigate homicides, rapes and drugs. Other departments, 
including the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, have "civilianized" 
their pawn enforcement squads. 
</P>
<P>
Kagele and others, however, said police officers are needed to deter the 
minority of pawnshop operators who, if left to their own devices, would traffic 
in stolen goods. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had 10 more people," said Kagele's boss, Detective Mark R. Myrdahl, "I 
could find 10 times as much stolen stuff. But we're not going to get 10 more 
people. The department doesn't have them." 
</P>
<P>
Myrdahl said his detail is augmented by a retired detective who voluntarily 
comes in weekly to help sort through the reams of pawn tickets and theft 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
The pawn detail detectives are also responsible for policing the city's 2,575 
second-hand stores, used-jewelry dealers, antique shops, junk collectors, junk 
dealers and used-book stores, any of which can be outlets for stolen goods. 
</P>
<P>
But they rarely have the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Where would you start?" Myrdahl said. "All we're doing is shoveling sand 
against the sea."

SNAPSHOT / A GLIMPSE OF THE SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
A JILTED HUSBAND, A BOMBED CHICKEN CAFE, 74 DAYS IN JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one was inside the chicken restaurant on Sunset Boulevard when the pipe bomb 
blew up in August, 1989. A good thing, detectives would say. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody could have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators learned that the owner of the restaurant, Fernando Gonzales, 
recently "ran off to Texas" with the wife and only child of Ohannes 
Meguerditchian, a self-employed diamond setter, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
Meguerditchian eventually was arrested and charged with the bombing, which 
buckled a wall and did an estimated $40,000 damage. Prosecutors also filed a 
special charge against Meguerditchian stating that he had to go to prison if 
found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
But after Meguerditchian agreed to plead no contest, the district attorney's 
office dropped the special charge and reduced the primary accusation to illegal 
possession of explosives. 
</P>
<P>
In May of this year, Superior Court Judge Lance Ito sentenced him to six months 
in jail. A six-month sentence in Los Angeles today amounts to 74 days.

PASTORS ON PATROL; 
</P>
<P>
VOLUNTEER CHAPLAINS RIDE WITH POLICE TO LEND SPIRITUAL HELP IN CRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two weeks after signing on as a chaplain with La Habra police, the Rev. Tony 
Barnes stood in a living room with the sheet-covered body of an AIDS patient 
who had taken a drug overdose, seeking to console the grieving mother. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'I have a pastor.' I said, 'I'm just here in any which way. Do you 
want coffee? I'll make you some coffee.' " 
</P>
<P>
As police officers gathered information and evidence, he answered the 
telephone, relaying messages to her from friends and police. And they began to 
talk. "We talked about God, his situation. She told me all about everything. We 
talked about life from A to Z." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, minister of the Vine, a 160-member nondenominational church in La 
Habra, is one of 23 ministers, priests and rabbis who have volunteered at least 
24 hours a month to patrol with La Habra police officers in a recently 
established counseling program offering around-the-clock spiritual help to 
families in crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing his new badge and beeper, Barnes, 43, has advised parents with an 
out-of-control teen-age daughter. He has offered solace to an elderly woman 
whose 92-year-old husband died in his sleep. He helped discover and save a man 
in the process of suicide and accompanied him and his former fiancee to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to help," Barnes said. "We're just there to serve the people in a time 
of need." 
</P>
<P>
The program, which began Nov. 1, has come together just before the holidays, 
when authorities expect higher levels of depression and stress. This year, 
financial pressures related to the recession are expected to exacerbate 
domestic violence and alcohol-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of hurting people out there," said Lt. John Buchholz, a police 
officer and church elder who administers the program. "These people are here to 
help if they want it." 
</P>
<P>
He said he and the former police chief, both active in Christian churches, 
aimed to use a willing and "untapped resource" to fill the gap left when busy 
police officers were forced to return to the field and leave grieving or 
troubled families to deal with a death, a suicide or a domestic fight. 
</P>
<P>
The program was patterned after one in Billings, Mont., Buchholz said. While 
some local cities have a few chaplains on call and a few contract with the 
county's Law Enforcement Assistance Program, La Habra's is thought to be the 
county's only program in which chaplains are scheduled 24 hours a day, 365 days 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
So far, with the program eight volunteers shy of its goal of 31, some of the 
chaplains are signing up for extra duty. 
</P>
<P>
Buchholz said the program is unique in that it also tries to help the officers. 
</P>
<P>
After a month, they have had no complaints about their nonsectarian advice. 
</P>
<P>
In at least one other city, however, residents have alleged that chaplains and 
officers were too eager to help. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente City Councilman Thomas Lorch said he received a call six months 
ago from parents who complained that they could not get help from police in 
retrieving their 17-year-old son, who had left home and moved in with a 
born-again Christian family. 
</P>
<P>
The parents blamed the city's chaplains and some police officers who were 
affiliated with with the born-again Christian movement. The boy has never 
returned home, Lorch said. 
</P>
<P>
Suggestions were made that the city enlarge and diversify its four-pastor 
chaplaincy program to include religious leaders of other faiths. 
</P>
<P>
In La Habra, Buchholz said, he has tried to ward off potential problems by 
including Catholic and Jewish leaders and instructing chaplains not to 
proselytize community members or officers. Only ordained ministers are allowed 
to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern is the safety of chaplains. In a mandatory training course, 
they are instructed where and how to stand in certain situations and to 
interject themselves only at the invitation of the officer. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not always easy for the pastors to take a back seat. "It's kind of 
difficult for them to bite their tongue and wait until it's their turn," said 
Buchholz. 
</P>
<P>
"We respond when an officer asks us to respond," said the Rev. Rex Spraggins, 
pastor of New Life Bible Center and chaplain coordinator. "Then we can go in 
and talk to the individual. Hopefully, he will seek whatever counseling he 
needs after that." 
</P>
<P>
The chaplains are issued business cards with the title La Habra Police 
Chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
Spraggins was recently invited by a sergeant to console the victim of an 
attempted rape. 
</P>
<P>
"I was invited to go in and work with the woman, talk to her, go in and pray 
with her, calm her down, calm her daughter down." 
</P>
<P>
After he learned she was Catholic, he contacted a priest, who in turn contacted 
her. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident, he said, he began talking with a man who had been drinking 
and became involved in a minor traffic accident. "I told him he was blowing his 
life by using the alcohol. I tried to reason with him. All of a sudden it 
seemed like a light shined. He stopped right there in front of witnesses and 
everything and just hugged my neck. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him my card. I think I'll hear from him someday." 
</P>
<P>
Spraggins, 57 and a grandfather of six, said he was frustrated at first by 
situations involving children. After one call when he saw a 14-year-old beating 
his mother, Spraggins said, he talked to Barnes, who then began organizing a 
church program where such children can be referred. "They need someone to be 
with them on weekends, get them interested in something and show them somebody 
cares." 
</P>
<P>
In his new experience as a chaplain he has seen a different side of La Habra, 
where he has lived for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been shocked at some of the conditions of the city and what has happened 
in the neighborhoods, going into homes and seeing the conditions. It's very 
sobering, the disarray, the dirt, the way people allow themselves to live." 
</P>
<P>
But it is a learning experience that Barnes relishes. 
</P>
<P>
"You get unattached to the world, working with kids and ministering. It 
attached me back to what's really happening. I'm now getting those experiences 
that only life gives you."

1,500 ATTEND TEACH-IN AGAINST GULF PRESENCE; 
</P>
<P>
PROTEST: THE CROWD AT FAIRFAX HIGH SCHOOL IS THE BIGGEST YET OF THE LOCAL 
ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT. ELLSBERG, KOVIC, CLARK SPEAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An enthusiastic crowd of more than 1,500 jammed the auditorium and grounds of 
Fairfax High School on Sunday, yelling and applauding in support of several 
nationally known activists who oppose any U.S. offensive against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
It was by far the largest expression of anti-war sentiment in California 
regarding the Bush Administration's Persian Gulf policy since U.S. troops were 
sent to Saudi Arabia in August. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the largest turnout calling for withdrawing U.S. forces was in New 
York City on Oct. 20, when 4,000 people marched along Broadway from Columbus 
Circle to Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here today to protest what could only be a god-awful war," said former 
U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark, who received a number of ovations. 
</P>
<P>
"We really have to come to grips with ourselves, America," said Clark, who also 
vociferously opposed the Vietnam War. "Why is it we have this propensity for 
war?" 
</P>
<P>
Clark was joined by anti-war activists Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon 
Papers during the Vietnam War; Ron Kovic, the Vietnam hero whose combat injury 
left him paralyzed, and political activist the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The event that brought these familiar voices of protest together was a 
"teach-in" -- a forum organizers said is designed to arm would-be demonstrators 
with information to support anti-war positions and with guidelines for 
mobilizing public support. 
</P>
<P>
The turnout was reminiscent of the 1960s protests against the Vietnam War. The 
presence of Clark and Ellsberg served to underscore those years of strident 
debate sparked by that conflict. 
</P>
<P>
A banner onstage Sunday declared "You Can Stop The War." A "Desert Shield 
Memorial Wall" listed the names of the 56 Americans who have died since U.S. 
forces were deployed. 
</P>
<P>
The Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations for Iraq's withdrawal from 
Kuwait lent an air of urgency to the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, Ellsberg, Kovic and other anti-war activists have been participating in 
a number of demonstrations across the nation in an effort to end U.S. military 
deployment in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the speakers talked of a major national demonstration in January 
against any move by Washington to use military force to liberate Kuwait from 
the occupying Iraqi forces. 
</P>
<P>
"We will shut down every university and every military recruiting station," 
Kovic yelled from his wheelchair. "We will win." 
</P>
<P>
Ellsberg, a research associate at Harvard Medical School, told the audience 
that Iraq is preparing for war with concrete bunkers, land mines, napalm and 
razor wire. 
</P>
<P>
"American troops have never been asked to go against fortifications like this . 
. . since the Normandy landing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellsberg urged a special session of Congress to debate gulf policy. If Bush 
proceeds with war over congressional opposition, he said, the President "should 
be impeached." 
</P>
<P>
"We can make this system work," he said. "We have 30 days to do it." 
</P>
<P>
A broad cross-section of people -- reflecting diversity of age and ethnic 
background -- were present Sunday. Several brought their children. "I was 
impressed with the crowd," Ellsberg told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Several of those who turned out said they believed demonstrations such as 
Sunday's would have an impact on U.S. policy-makers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a broad spectrum of people," observed Carol Thompson, 46, a USC 
professor. "We think it's a very strong message to Bush to not go to war." 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the crowd, Linda Lotz of Pasadena, called the turnout 
"extraordinary, but not surprising." 
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-seat auditorium was filled to capacity, while loudspeakers carried 
speeches and songs to hundreds more outside. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Sgt. Wolfgang Hundertmark said a few shoving matches 
occurred among opposing activist groups, but there were no arrests. The 
sergeant said the event's sponsors had leased the public high school grounds so 
they could legally prevent perceived troublemakers from entering the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the school gates, about a dozen counterdemonstrators complained that 
they had not been allowed in. Several carried signs with slogans such as 
"Liberate Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
"Our point of view is that Saddam Hussein is another Hitler who must be 
neutralized," said Irv Rubin, chairman of the Jewish Defense League. "It's only 
a matter of time before he gets a nuclear weapon and he will use it." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin criticized the event's sponsor, Los Angeles Coalition Against U.S. 
Involvement in the Middle East, for including Palestinian groups on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Blase Bonpane, a spokesman for organizers of the event, said the pro-deployment 
group had been turned away to prevent "disruptive behavior." 
</P>
<P>
"People (are) wanting to hear the Palestinian position. Over the years, we've 
heard the Israelis' position to a much higher degree," Bonpane said. "This is 
not anti anything, except war." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers John Johnson and Judy Pasternak contributed to this story.

ROBBERY SUSPECTS' GETAWAY CAR HITS, KILLS GIRL IN WATTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A 7-year-old girl was killed when a car containing robbery suspects slammed 
into her in Watts on Sunday afternoon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, witnesses to the incident chased down the car that struck the 
child and held one of the two occupants for police. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the victim, identified only as Jennifer, was struck at 95th and 
San Pedro streets, five men attempted to rob a liquor store at 91st and 
Broadway, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Peter Vanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, something went wrong. A person working in the store opened fire on 
the robbers and chased them to their nearby parked cars and sped away. One of 
the cars struck Jennifer and narrowly missed her 12-year-old sister. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at the accident scene five minutes afterward," Vanson said. "It was 
terrible. But you have to distract yourself. Our job is to catch the suspects." 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses saw the hit-and-run incident and some of them chased the 
speeding car in their own vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
At 92nd and Flower streets, the hit-and-run car hit a street light and, 
although the two occupants attempted to run away, one was chased down and 
captured by a citizen in a nearby back yard. During an ensuing struggle, the 
citizen grabbed the man's handgun and disarmed him. 
</P>
<P>
A second man, believed to be the driver of the car, escaped on foot. 
</P>
<P>
The man in custody was taken to the Southeast Division station and booked for 
investigation of murder, police said. His name was not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
Vanson said Jennifer and her sister lived in a foster home and that, as of 
Sunday night, another team of detectives had not been able to locate their 
mother or father.

SUPERVISORIAL ELECTION ENDORSEMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
KEY LATINO GROUP BACKS MOLINA IN THE 1ST DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Mexican-American Political Assn. voted by a narrow margin Sunday to endorse 
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina in the Jan. 22 special election for 
Los Angeles County supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
The endorsement followed a two-hour question-and-answer session attended by six 
candidates and about 75 delegates to a countywide MAPA convention at a Rosemead 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
MAPA is one of the nation's oldest Latino political associations and the 
endorsement is considered important in the predominantly Latino 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
No candidate won a majority on the convention's first ballot: Molina received 
49% of the vote, state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) 44% and Sarah Flores (a 
former aide to Supervisor Pete Schabarum) 7%. State Sen. Charles M. Calderon 
(D-Whittier), who represents a large part of the San Gabriel Valley, did not 
receive a single vote. 
</P>
<P>
Molina defeated Torres on the second ballot 51% to 49%. 
</P>
<P>
The balloting was conducted during a closed meeting of delegates after the 
public question-and-answer session. Although MAPA officials declined to provide 
an exact tally of the vote, several delegates said Molina defeated Torres by a 
single vote. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge ordered the election earlier this year after finding that the 
all-Anglo Board of Supervisors had drawn district boundaries to discriminate 
against Latino candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In other key endorsements last week, Torres received the support of Los Angeles 
City Councilman Michael Woo, while Calderon was backed by the Assn. for Los 
Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's MAPA convention, the candidates discussed a variety of issues, 
including proposals for cityhood for East Los Angeles, rent control and the 
crisis in public health care. 
</P>
<P>
Candidate Joe Chavez, a county computer analyst, said he differed from the 
others seeking the post because he is "unbiased and not committed to any 
individual interest groups because of (campaign) contributions." 
</P>
<P>
Khalil Khalil, a county engineer and native of Egypt, said he would represent 
the county's diverse immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
All the candidates said they favor expanding the number of seats on the board 
from five to seven. They were also united in their criticism of the current 
board's policy of "contracting out" -- granting contracts to private companies 
to perform county services. 
</P>
<P>
Torres quipped: "The only people we should be contracting out are (conservative 
supervisors) Michael Antonovich, Pedro Schabarum and Deane Dana." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, Flores, Molina and Torres all spoke in favor of cityhood for 
unincorporated East Los Angeles. Khalil and Chavez, however, said they did not 
believe East Los Angeles could generate sufficient tax revenue to support 
municipal services.

<P>
The candidates also answered questions about the impact of development on 
impoverished Latino communities. 
</P>
<P>
Molina said the county needs to preserve low-cost housing by regulating 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to allow what happened in Chavez Ravine (now Dodger Stadium) 
and Bunker Hill (now a complex of high-rise structures) to happen again," she 
said. "We need to tell developers that the free ride is over." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon said: "We need to encourage growth development not that displaces 
individuals but that provides clean, new homes for those people." 
</P>
<P>
Flores added that developers should "be responsible for the impact of their 
projects."

TB RATES CLIMB TO RECORD IN '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tuberculosis rates apparently made a record climb in 1990, with the largest 
nationwide increase since national reporting on the disease began, the American 
Lung Assn. said last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing large increases in TB in many cities and states," said ALA 
President Dr. John Allen. 
</P>
<P>
The infectious lung disease, long associated with 19th-Century poverty and 
considered nearly vanquished in recent decades, has been on the rise since 
1985, and preliminary reports show its greatest increase in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
TB incidence through November, 1990, increased by 8% and appeared headed for a 
10% increase for the year by the end of December, the ALA said, citing new 
figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control. The CDC said that 20,792 
cases had been reported for 1990 by Nov. 24, compared to 19,205 by the same 
time in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Experts blame much of the rise on the immune depressing effects of the human 
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which is linked to AIDS. TB increases were 
especially marked among blacks and Latinos, young adults and children under age 
5, Allen said.

CITY OKS POLICE DOG FOR NARCOTICS SQUAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved the addition of a dog to the police force to make 
narcotic searches quicker and easier. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials say a dog can search an area in half the time it would take 
five officers and can uncover hidden narcotics that would otherwise go 
undetected by humans. 
</P>
<P>
"To speed our job up, to make us more efficient, we feel we need this 
additional tool," Cmdr. Gary Biggerstaff told the council, which approved the 
plan unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
The dog will be assigned to an officer and will live in that officer's home. 
Police dogs usually work five to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The dog will be able to detect marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines. 
Biggerstaff said that neighboring agencies could also use the dog. 
</P>
<P>
The Rotary Club of Los Alamitos will donate up to $6,000 for purchase and 
training costs and an additional $1,000 each year for food and medical 
expenses. The dog will go through about four months of training. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department will also provide $1,000 for travel expenses and up to 
$1,000 more to purchase a dog house and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics officers have been borrowing dogs from other departments for the 
searches, but Biggerstaff said that those dogs were sometimes difficult to get 
because they were in such demand. TED JOHNSON

BIG QUAKES FOUND TO BE PRECEDED BY SMALLER JOLTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists who have studied the historical record before major earthquakes in 
California over the last 150 years have concluded that large earthquakes may be 
preceded by smaller quakes in the same seismic zone during the one or two 
decades before the main event. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn R. Sykes and Stephen C. Jaume of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty 
Geological Observatory found that moderate earthquakes occurred with increasing 
frequency during the two decades before the San Francisco Bay Area quakes in 
1968, 1906 and 1989 and a Southern California quake in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
The areas remained seismically quiet for years after the larger quakes. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists concluded that the smaller quakes preceding the larger jolts 
"are casually related to those four main shocks," and thus it would be 
reasonable to assume that major quakes in California should follow years of 
increasing seismic activity. The scientists published their study last week in 
the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that the record suggests that there is a low probability of large 
quakes on the San Andreas Fault north of San Francisco or the northern half of 
the Hayward Fault in the next few decades, but the implications are less clear 
for other areas of California. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the same issue of the journal, Allan G. Lindh, chief of seismology 
at the U.S. Geological Survey's Menlo Park facility, warned against drawing any 
sweeping conclusions from the study.

CELLS: RESEARCH PROJECTS ARE DEMONSTRATING THAT HUMANS ARE NOT AS DIFFERENT 
FROM OTHER SPECIES AS THEY HAVE LONG IMAGINED THEMSELVES TO BE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Many people have heard about the Human Genome Project, the $3-billion, 15-year 
effort to map the 50,000 to 100,000 genes that make up the blueprint for human 
life. It's one of the federal government's "Big Science" projects, along with 
the $6-billion Superconducting Supercollider and the $1.4-billion Hubble Space 
Telescope. 
</P>
<P>
But how many know about the Mouse Genome Project? Or the Rice Genome Project? 
How about the efforts to map the genes of worms, tomatoes, yeast, fruit flies, 
wheat, onions, lettuce, bacteria, or a tiny weed called Arabodopsis? 
</P>
<P>
The projects have a functional purpose: Mapping the genes of fruit flies and 
the tiny nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, for example, will help 
scientists understand similar biochemical functions in humans, such as how 
vision works and how cell death occurs. Tracking rice and wheat genomes may 
keep the world's burgeoning population from famine. The mouse project, among 
other things, will help those tackling the enormous human genome project by 
validating mapping techniques. 
</P>
<P>
But the projects are also contributing to an overriding theme: that humans are 
not as different and separate from other species as they have long imagined 
themselves to be. 
</P>
<P>
"The real message is that all of life is extremely similar," said Tom Roderick, 
senior staff scientist at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Me. "We're all 
humming and moving along together -- our cells are behaving very similarly." 
</P>
<P>
Mapping various plant and animal species' genomes is the key to unraveling the 
chemical blueprint that determines the characteristics of all living organisms, 
such as resistance to a particular disease in lettuce, or the cause of a 
disease such as Alzheimer's in humans. 
</P>
<P>
Mapping a genome consists of locating landmarks or identified genes on a 
chromosome. Genetic mapping links a particular gene to a chromosome by studying 
the expression of that gene through successive generations. 
</P>
<P>
This type of mapping has been going on since 1911, when the gene for human 
color blindness was traced through several generations of families. It was 
linked to the gene that determines female gender, and thus determined to be on 
the X chromosome. 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of recombinant technologies in the 1970s, scientists began to 
isolate a piece of DNA -- the genetic blueprint of life -- with restriction 
enzymes that cut a specific sequence along the chain, then clone it and make 
more detailed physical maps. Physical maps use these molecular techniques to 
locate genes or identified sequences of DNA associated with genes on a 
particular part of a chromosome. 
</P>
<P>
Humans have 3 billion chemical-letter steps, or base pairs, arranged into 23 
pairs of chromosomes. On them are 50,000 to 100,000 genes. The most definitive 
mapping -- sequencing -- will identify all the base pairs in the genome in 
order, from one end of each chromosome to the other. 
</P>
<P>
The physical maps for two single-cell organisms -- baker's yeast and the 
bacteria Escherichia coli are essentially complete. In the animal kingdom, the 
nematode worm, C. elegans, is close behind, and is one of the more amazing 
projects to come out of biology. 
</P>
<P>
The story of the nematode began with Sydney Brenner, an English scientist at 
the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Medical Biology in Cambridge, who 
set a goal in 1963 to know all there was to know about a many-celled animal. He 
chose a tiny transparent worm no longer than a millimeter. Three hundred can 
fit in a biologist's petri dish. Their life span is only three days. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly three decades of research, Brenner and his graduate students, who 
continued the project at their own labs, now know that this little worm has 959 
cells. Like constructing a family tree, the scientists have traced the lineage 
of each cell to the original egg cell. They have also completed a wiring 
diagram of the 302 neurons (humans have 100 billion neurons) and connections 
that make up the worm's nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the physical map is nearly complete, scientists have decided to 
sequence the worm's 100 million base pairs, with its 3,000 to 8,000 genes. When 
that is done, a project estimated to last 10 years, they will know more about 
this tiny worm than any other multi-celled animal. 
</P>
<P>
Having that coding information will help scientists study biological mechanisms 
in other organisms, said Robert Horvitz, professor of biology at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., who researches cell 
death. 
</P>
<P>
By identifying the series of genes involved in cell death in the worm, he will 
have more information for studying cell death in humans. "Clinically, it's very 
important," he said. "There are lots of neurodegenerative diseases where cell 
death is involved: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's. It's a very basic component of 
stroke, trauma and heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
The fruit fly, the mainstay in the study of genetics, also can provide clues to 
human functions, and the effort to map its genome began three years ago. For 
example, said Dan Hartl, head of the genetics department at Washington 
University School of Medicine in St. Louis, some components of the fruit fly's 
visual system are the same in humans. "We can identify what receives light, how 
that protein signals the next protein, and how it changes to tell the organism 
that it's seen something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The physical map of the fruit fly should be completed in two or three years, 
and then, Hartl said, it's on to sequencing. "I want to identify and sequence 
all the genes in (the fruit fly)," Hartl said. "I'm still young enough -- 47 -- 
that it will be done in my professional lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
For years, the model species for the plant world has been a weed called 
Arabodopsis, "a miserable little beast," said Richard Michelmore, a UC Davis 
lettuce researcher. "It's the green thing you see between the cracks in the 
pavement." 
</P>
<P>
But its relatively small number of base pairs -- 70 million -- and the ability 
to grow eight to 12 life cycles a year, prompted the founding of a cooperative 
genome project this year. It is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Institutes of Health and the 
National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
A separate project -- the Plant Genome Project -- has scientists scrambling for 
the $11 million that the USDA will spread among those mapping rice, wheat, 
barley onion, corn, wheat, soybean, tomato, lettuce and "some of the smaller 
veggies," according to project director Jerome Miksche of the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
But some scientists are not relying only on the USDA. Michelmore, who completed 
a map of lettuce's nine chromosomes (consisting of 2 billion base pairs), 
receives part of his funding from California lettuce growers. He does not care 
about sequencing the entire genome. Instead, he is focusing on isolating genes 
for disease resistance, with the goal of incorporating them into lettuce crops. 
</P>
<P>
"Disease resistance is a hot topic," he said. "We don't know how it works in 
any organism." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Rodriguez, a UC Davis genetics professor, began coordinating a 
U.S.-Japanese effort to map the rice genome two years ago, after he learned 
that Japan had started its own rice genome project. His primary concern in 
pushing the project is to ward off world famine. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, the worldwide production of rice, which is a primary source of 
nutrition for 60% of the world's population and is 80% of the caloric intake of 
2 billion Asians, accelerated as a result of the Green Revolution that spread 
the results of classical plant breeding to other countries. "Now we're in a 
race to keep up with population demand," Rodriguez said. "We're looking for 
some way to create a second Green Revolution." With the acceptance of the Human 
Genome Project, he decided the time was ripe for rice. 
</P>
<P>
Although genetic engineering of plants has been touted as a solution to feeding 
the world's future millions, it is a long-term solution, Rodriguez said, at 
least 20 years away. But the demand for rice will double within the next 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A short-cut is to map the genes on rice chromosomes, enabling plant breeders to 
use genetic probes to determine if desired genes, such as those for salt 
tolerance or drought resistance, have survived in offspring of cross breeding. 
</P>
<P>
The genome project most closely linked to the Human Genome Project is that of 
the mouse, which officially began on Sept. 1, although scientists have been 
mapping parts of mouse chromosomes for years. So much of mouse and human DNA is 
alike -- more than 90% -- that some scientists suggest that the mouse genome be 
mapped before the human one. 
</P>
<P>
Since mice can be inbred to track genes -- something that cannot be done in 
humans -- it will be easier to develop the genetic maps more quickly. "But, for 
political reasons, the interest is in getting the human genome done," said Joe 
Nadeau, a Jackson Laboratory scientist working on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Early medical benefits from the human genome project will come from identifying 
genetic diseases and devising tests to detect those diseases in people. 
</P>
<P>
The quintessential laboratory animal model, the mouse has 20 chromosomes, with 
about the same number of base pairs and genes as humans. Many scientists study 
the mouse and the human genome together. 
</P>
<P>
That approach provides clues to molecular evolution by determining what parts 
of the DNA sequence were conserved in humans when the human and mouse trees 
separated 65 million to 70 million years ago. It also helps those looking for 
human disease genes by finding the same disease genes in the mouse first to 
figure out where to look on the human genome. 
</P>
<P>
So far, of the 2,720 loci -- genes and DNA markers associated with genes -- 
located on the mouse map and 1,884 located on the human map, 535 are the same. 
"I know there are going to be lots more," said Roderick. 
</P>
<P>
"It's healthy for human beings to know that we aren't somehow different and 
apart and special," Roderick said. "If you take the origin of life on Earth and 
make it the height of the Washington Monument, human beings are a postage stamp 
on top, proving we're still an experiment. To think that our special brain is 
going to keep us going isn't necessarily true. Evolution is trying out 
intelligence. It may not work." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simple Combinations Make Up Complex Ladder of DNA 
</P>
<P>
All genes -- whether in plants or animals -- are made up of DNA -- 
deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA is made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), 
thymine (T), cytosine (C) and guanine (G). These bases, arranged in pairs (A 
bonds with T, C bonds with G), form the steps of DNA's twisting ladder, known 
as the double helix. 
</P>
<P>
Genes are chains, or sequences, of these chemical-letter steps along the DNA. 
They code for particular proteins that perform the functions necessary for 
cells to function. In between the genes are long stretches of "junk" DNA, 
described as such because scientists don't yet know its function. The DNA in a 
cell is divided into long, thin strands called chromosomes that wind throughout 
the nucleus of a cell. During cell division, these chromosomes constrict into 
short, fat segments resembling rice grains and can be seen under a microscope. 
All the DNA in a cell's chromosomes is called a genome. 
</P>
<P>
Humans have 3 billion chemical-letter steps, or base pairs, arranged in 23 
pairs of chromosomes. On them are 50,000 to 100,000 genes. (An average gene is 
made up of about 30,000 base pairs.) Fruit flies, on the other hand, have about 
10,000 genes on 165 million base pairs arranged into four chromosomes. One 
would expect that humans, being so complex, would have more genetic material 
than any other species. They don't. Wheat has 4 billion base pairs. Pine trees 
have 5 billion. Salamanders have 90 billion. But all have fewer genes than 
humans.

MIKE PENNER: SURVIVOR OF TITAN FOOTBALL GETS SECOND CHANCE AT PURDUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A decade removed from his last head coaching job, Jim Colletto kicks back in 
his new office at Purdue University, reveling in the difference between then 
and now. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now," Colletto says, speaking by phone, "I'm looking out the window of 
my beautiful office at a stadium that seats 70,000. I can see an indoor 
practice facility that's as good as any in the country. I'm coaching at a 
school that plays in a great football conference." 
</P>
<P>
Colletto laughs. 
</P>
<P>
"My office in Fullerton, I had to put the plywood on the wall myself. My office 
also shared a wall with the girls' gymnasium and the hot steam from the showers 
made the plywood buckle." 
</P>
<P>
The wall makes an apt metaphor for Colletto's five-year tenure at Cal State 
Fullerton (1975-79). It, too, buckled -- bowing under the strain of having 
pushed the Division I issue before Fullerton was even close to ready. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Colletto was the youngest Division I head coach in the country and 
Fullerton was the youngest Division I football team in the country. Colletto 
was 30 at the time, a winner during his playing days at UCLA, where he 
captained the 1966 Rose Bowl champions. Fullerton football was six, having 
completed a successful run at the Division II level under Dick Coury and Pete 
Yoder. 
</P>
<P>
It was going to be a case of youth serving youth. The idea was for Colletto and 
the Titans to grow together, to learn together, to struggle and develop and 
mature together. 
</P>
<P>
Nice idea. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, Colletto was the oldest 35-year-old football coach alive, 
beaten down by a 17-38-1 record, exhausted from running the same obstacle 
course Gene Murphy runs today. After a 3-8 season in 1979, Colletto resigned, 
unsure if his head coaching career hadn't lost its grip on the very first rung. 
</P>
<P>
"Neale Stoner (then Fullerton athletic director) told me my best chance to get 
back was to go somewhere and be a coordinator," Colletto said. "Neale said, 
'That'll give you the opportunity to outlive this problem.' 
</P>
<P>
"It worked." 
</P>
<P>
Colletto returned to UCLA, where his old teammate, Terry Donahue, was head 
coach. "Terry was kind enough to hire me as an assistant and let me regroup for 
a couple years," Colletto said. From there, it was on to stints as offensive 
coordinator at Purdue, Arizona State and Ohio State before, 11 days ago, Purdue 
named Colletto as its new head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, good things can happen to old Titans who wait. 
</P>
<P>
Colletto lost many things at Fullerton -- games, naivete, hair, a smoothly 
functioning digestive tract -- but a sense of humor wasn't among them. Ask him 
about those bygone years and Colletto will crack, "I've tried to forget them 
all." 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't, though. For a long time those years seemed to be the albatross 
around the neck of his resume, but time -- along with a lucrative five-year 
contract at Purdue -- has shed a kinder light on the dark ages of Jim Colletto. 
</P>
<P>
"That whole situation, as difficult as it was, was a very valuable experience," 
Colletto said. "It was like a laboratory experiment, and I don't mean that 
facetiously. You're thrown into an environment where you're going to make 
mistakes. You learn pretty fast that there's a lot more to it than Xs and O's 
and that you're not going to be the next Knute Rockne. 
</P>
<P>
"But every problem I experienced there has been magnified at every school I've 
been at since. It's given me a little better perspective." 
</P>
<P>
A checklist of those problems, circa 1979, sounds painfully familiar. Has 
Colletto been sitting in on any of Murphy's media luncheons lately? 
</P>
<P>
"We played all over the place. We played every stadium dedication and 
homecoming across the country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I had great support from the athletic administration -- Neale Stoner, 
(president) Donald Shields -- but we didn't have many resources. There was no 
on-campus housing. There were very few funds for recruiting and there was zilch 
for game films. I had to use my own camera, my own Super-8 and my own film. I 
raked the practice field to have it soft enough for practice. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a whole litany of things. It was all the result of trying to move up 
to Division I when the school wasn't ready." 
</P>
<P>
Is it yet? Fullerton has just now broken ground on the on-campus football 
stadium that, Colletto says, "was first proposed when I was there." And this 
season, the Titans broke new ground of a different sort -- finishing 1-11, the 
worst single-season record in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep up with what's going on there," Colletto said. "I think Gene Murphy has 
done a great job. He had a rough year this year. but I don't know how they can 
expect to have winning records there, year-in and year-out. 
</P>
<P>
"The money problems are inherent. They'll always be there. And from a fairness 
standpoint, they're physically incapable of playing those big schools, where 
you get the big scores. Gene's done about as good a job as you can do there." 
</P>
<P>
Today, different problems confront Colletto. He has inherited from Fred Akers a 
Purdue program that was crippled by one quarterback transfer -- Jeff George, to 
Illinois -- and now has to ward off a second, now that run-and-shoot incumbent 
Eric Hunter no longer has Akers' run-and-shoot to run. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a meeting with Eric," Colletto said, "and told him that in nine years as 
an offensive coordinator, I worked with Scott Campbell, who's now 
quarterbacking the Atlanta Falcons; Jim Everett, who you know about; Jeff Van 
Raaphorst, who was a Rose Bowl MVP, and Greg Frey, who set records at Ohio 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Eric, if you want to play somewhere else, fine,' but I think he's 
going to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Colletto has a reputation for fine craftsmanship when it comes to grooming 
young quarterbacks. That's an improvement. At Fullerton, Colletto had a 
reputation for fine craftsmanship when it came to putting up office walls.

SEA VIEW LEAGUE; 
</P>
<P>
TUSTIN SHOWING IT'S THE TEAM TO CHASE FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among Sea View League boys' basketball coaches, there is little doubt Tustin 
High School is the favorite to win the league title. 
</P>
<P>
The only doubt comes from Tustin Coach Tom McCluskey, who is uncomfortable 
thinking so far into the future. In November, he ranked his team second in 
Orange County in the Times' preseason poll, fourth in the league behind Corona 
del Mar, Woodbridge and Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
After a fast start that included winning the championship of the Trabuco Hills 
Tournament, McCluskey admitted he was less than forthcoming with his 
prediction. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect to be fourth but we know it's going to be tough," McCluskey 
said. "The last couple of years, we've faded the last couple of weeks of the 
season, so we're going in kind of cautiously. We feel we have our best team in 
the four years I've been here, but you never know what is going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Said Newport Harbor Coach Bob Serven: "He's sandbagging a lot. They should be 
first, hands down. They have a great team. 
</P>
<P>
"His second string may be fourth, but his first team is first." 
</P>
<P>
A closer look: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CORONA DEL MAR 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Paul Orris (fifth year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 20-11, 7-3 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: One. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Jon Upham (F, 6-5, Sr.); Doug Hesse (F, 6-4, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Jeff Orris (C, 6-2, Sr.); Jason Clark (G, 6-1, Jr.); Mike Susson 
(G, 5-10, Jr.); Dave Olsen (G, 6-1, Sr.); Nick Mansour (G-F, 6-2, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Only two players remain from the team that lost to Dos Pueblos in the 
Division 3-A championship game, which helps explain why the Sea Kings have 
started slowly. A tough schedule -- the team plays Estancia (twice), Canyon 
Country Canyon, Capistrano Valley and Banning in nonleague games -- hasn't 
helped, but Orris believes it will once league starts. "I think we'll be right 
in there when league comes around, but we may take some lumps getting there," 
Orris said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEWPORT HARBOR 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bob Serven (second year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 20-7, 7-3 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Three. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: One. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Justin McIntee (F, 6-3, Jr.); Huy Nguyen (G, 5-11, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Mike Stipe (G, 6-0, Sr.); Mark McAnlis (F, 6-2, Soph.); Mike 
Klytta (G, 5-10, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Sailors, who were co-league champions with Corona del Mar last 
season, are a smaller, quicker team this year. The front line, which at 7-foot, 
6-7 and 6-4 was one of the tallest in the county, is gone but the team has 
started this season quickly, losing only to Irvine in the championship of the 
Tipoff Classic. Still, Serven is concerned with the Sailors' lack of depth, 
which was further diminished last week when Billy Nguyen, who averaged 16 
points in the first four games, was dismissed from school for disciplinary 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SADDLEBACK 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Pat Quinn (12th year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 18-11, 5-5 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: One. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Jason Register (F, 6-3, Jr.); Vince Chaverst (G, 6-1, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Chris Bradshaw (G, 5-11, Fr.); Rob Holloway (F, 6-4, Fr.); Luis 
Estrella (G, 6-1, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: A difficult schedule, set up when Saddleback was consistently 
challenging for division titles, has made the early going tough. Four players 
from last year's team are playing for Moorpark and Rancho Santiago colleges, 
two of the top community college teams in the state, and the remaining 
Roadrunners haven't yet jelled. With two freshmen getting playing time and the 
team's leader, Register, a junior, the Roadrunners have the youngest team in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TUSTIN 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Tom McCluskey (fourth year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 20-8, 5-5 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Five. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: David Beilstein (G, 5-11, Sr.); Thomas Clayton (G-F, 6-2, Sr.); 
Jentry Moore (G, 6-2, Jr.); Brian Reider (C, 6-6, Sr.); Robert Laubach (G-F, 
6-0, Sr.) 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Derek Roach (G, 5-10 Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Beilstein, who is averaging more than 20 points, is the most notable 
of the Tillers' four returning starters and some teams have already tried to 
stop him with gimmick defenses. But McCluskey said the other players should be 
able to ease Beilstein's load more than they were able to last season. Moore 
and Clayton were all-league selections last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UNIVERSITY 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Mike Dinneen (first year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 5-18, 0-10 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: One. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Donnell Dowdy (F, 6-3, Jr.); Luis Venegas (G, 6-0, Jr.); David 
Bianco (F, 6-5, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Ben Durham (G, 6-0, Jr.); Michael James (G, 5-10, Jr.); Josh 
Whelihan (G, 5-11, Jr.); Clark Duey (F, 6-3, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Dinneen takes over after 10 years at St. Paul in Santa Fe Springs and 
brings with him a running style that has already helped the Trojans score 100 
points for the first time in the school's history in a 103-100 loss to Los 
Alamitos. Venegas, who was called up from the junior varsity before last league 
season, made nine three-point shots in a victory over Foothill and averaged 29 
points in three Trabuco Hills Tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WOODBRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bill Shannon (10th year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 14-12, 5-5 in Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Seven. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Ryan Rauch (F, 6-4, Sr.); Toby Ramos (G, 6-0, Jr.); Mike Fenton 
(C, 6-7, Sr.); Romalis Taylor (F, 6-3, Sr.); Bryant McLemore (F, 6-3, Sr.); 
Matt Murphy (G, 6-3, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Todd Loewe (G, 6-1, Jr.); Robin Pingle (G, 5-9, Sr.); Ryan 
Sunderman (F, 6-2, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Returning to the league after four years in the Pacific Coast League, 
the Warriors are the pick to give Tustin the toughest challenge for the title. 
Besides the seven lettermen back, Woodbridge has five players up from the 
junior varsity team that was 23-0 last season. Rauch, who has visited Yale and 
Columbia, should become the school's third basketball player to earn an NCAA 
Division I scholarship. This is Woodbridge's 10th season of varsity basketball.

Tuesday -- The South Coast League.

KAROLIUSSEN FEELS RIGHT AT HOME IN U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: EXCHANGE STUDENT FROM NORWAY, WHO BEGAN PLAYING AT 5, HELPS CORONA DEL 
MAR TO 7-2 RECORD AND SHOT AT LEAGUE TITLE.

<P>
Draped on a soccer goal at Corona del Mar High School was a banner that read, 
"Ola, The Winter Formal???" 
</P>
<P>
Ola Karoliussen, an exchange student from Norway, smiled. He carefully removed 
the invitation, then neatly folded it up to take home. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a good girl; the answer will be yes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Karoliussen has adjusted to life in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
He came to the United States, like his father before him, to learn more about 
the country and its culture -- including American football. He has absorbed as 
much as possible and been a boost to Sea King soccer in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Corona del Mar finished fourth in the Sea View League. This year, 
the Sea Kings are 7-2 and a favorite to win the league title. 
</P>
<P>
Karoliussen, who plays every position except goalie, is big reason for that 
success, having scored four goals and assisted on six. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of players back from last year, so I felt we would be a pretty 
good team," Corona del Mar Coach Martin McGrogan said. "But Ola was a great 
bonus. He's a tremendous player." 
</P>
<P>
Karoliussen grew up in Namsos, a city of 7,000 about 420 miles from Oslo. He 
began playing soccer when he was 5 and has developed into an outstanding 
player, even by tough European standards. 
</P>
<P>
But Karoliussen's interests extend beyond athletics. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Eagal, was an exchange student in 1957 and remains in contact with 
his host family in Alabama. The Karoliussen family visited Alabama in 1974, 
Ola's first trip to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Karoliussen's three sisters also were exchange students; one went to 
Baltimore, the other to Wisconsin. So Ola decided he, too, wanted to see the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important to know many languages and cultures," he said. "It can 
help you in the business field. I wanted to build up my English and learn about 
this country." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Wellput and his family previously have been hosts to exchange students 
for the American Field Service. In the past four years, three students have 
lived with them. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Wellput wanted to take a year off, but agreed to help place students 
in other homes. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I came across Ola's application," said Wellput, a lawyer. "After 
reading it, I decided we had to have him live with us. He had such a strong 
academic record and other members of his family had been in the program. I 
thought it would be a positive experience for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Karoliussen had a few misconceptions about the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We know a lot about this country from what we see from music, movies and 
television," he said. "But I found that people here were a lot friendlier than 
I thought they would be. It's easy to get to know a person, because Americans 
are very open." 
</P>
<P>
Karoliussen made a smooth transition. His blond hair helped him fit in at 
Corona del Mar and his personality made him popular. 
</P>
<P>
One girl even asked him where his surf board was, because she thought he was a 
resident. Karoliussen told her that he was from Norway and had reindeer 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time, the exchange students we get here are very timid at first," 
Corona del Mar Athletic Director Jerry Jelnick said. "Not Ola. The first time I 
met him, he was outgoing and funny. I was trying to pronounce his name. He 
stopped me and said, 'Just call me Dallas. It's easier.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dallas is a nickname from Karoliussen's attempt to play football. He considers 
football as the American sport, so he felt compelled to try out for the team. 
</P>
<P>
Karoliussen was a wide receiver and kicker this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew a little about the sport from television, but I had some problems at 
first," he said. "I wouldn't run the right patterns and sometimes the ball 
would hit me in the face." 
</P>
<P>
Sea King football Coach Dave Holland said Karoliussen learned the game quickly. 
Although he never played in a game, Karoliussen became a good receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"Ola was very daring and he liked the contact," Holland said. "I think he could 
be a very good player. In fact, I wish I could have him for another year." 
</P>
<P>
But soccer is definitely Karoliussen's sport. He had contacted McGrogan when 
school began and asked for a tryout. 
</P>
<P>
McGrogan said the audition was a quick one -- it was obvious Karoliussen had 
superior skills. 
</P>
<P>
It was also apparent to opponents from the first game, when Karoliussen scored 
twice in a 4-1 victory over Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, opponents have double-teamed him, but they've done little to stop 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Soccer here isn't at the same level," Karoliussen said. "The practices are 
different. It seems like guys practice because they have to, not because they 
want to. But that's because soccer isn't as big over here yet." 
</P>
<P>
Karoliussen will return in July to Norway, where he plays for a club team. He 
said he would like to play in college and maybe as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
But those plans will have to be put on hold for at least a year. He has to 
repeat his senior year in high school next year in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind, because the experience I've had will help me," he said. "I've 
learned a great deal about this country and my English is much better. I have a 
lot of new friends and I have a new family." 
</P>
<P>
And a date for the Winter Formal.

<P>
Last month, President Bush signed into law the Clean Air Act of 1990, which 
some experts have touted as the most comprehensive legislation ever enacted to 
protect the environment. The law requires nearly every major industry to 
drastically cut its emissions of pollutants by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also strengthens regulations regarding land and water pollution. The 
message to business is clear -- clean up your act. The small- and medium-sized 
business person thinking this call to action applies only to oil refineries and 
car manufacturers is in for a rude awakening. Those polluting the environment 
are receiving record fines and even prison sentences if prosecutors can prove 
criminal negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Stewart has served as an environmental lawyer since the late 1970s. He 
briefly worked as a chemical engineer at Union Carbide Corp. before attending 
law school at the University of Michigan. After graduation, he went to work for 
the law firm of Jones Day Reavis &amp; Pogue. He has worked at the firm's 
offices in Cleveland, Dallas, Austin, Tex., and, most recently, in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm represents General Motors plants in California, Texas, Louisiana and 
Massachusetts. Texas Instruments is another client. Stewart and his colleagues 
have litigated cases in all 10 regions of the Environmental Protection Agency 
involving more than 100 waste cleanup matters, helping companies arrive at the 
most cost-effective solution. Because one company can be held liable for 
cleaning up an entire waste dump, environmental lawyers are employed to make 
sure no parties pay more than their fair share of the damage. Stewart, 39, 
recently sat down to talk about what companies need to know about environmental 
laws with Times staff writer Gregory Crouch. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the major pieces of legislation that apply to Orange County 
businesses, both federally and locally? 
</P>
<P>
A. The major federal and state legislation tend to parallel each other because 
both governments need to deal with the same issues in the environment. 
Generally there would be both a state and federal Clean Air Act that would 
regulate any kind of emissions of pollutants or contaminants that go into what 
we call the ambient air -- outside air. Then there are the statutes that 
regulate waste materials -- what results after the manufacturing process -- 
known as the Resource Conservation Recovery Act. The federal regulations in 
that area have historically focused on hazardous waste whereas the state 
regulations have historically been broader to focus on both hazardous waste and 
non-hazardous waste. What we've learned over the years is that non-hazardous 
waste has a lot of very hazardous things in it. And then there are laws about 
messes made in the past. The principal statute there is something we call 
Superfund, which imposes strict liability for past disposal of waste and 
requires companies or individual owners of property to clean up the mess. 
Finally, there are the Clean Water Acts, both federal and state. Those would 
regulate discharge of pollution into our waters. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Anything else? 
</P>
<P>
A. Those are the real highlights and there are a lot of laws filling in the 
gaps. For instance, there's a federal law called the Toxic Substance Control 
Act that is designed to regulate anybody who is inventing new chemicals to make 
sure we're not producing some more toxic substances. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do these laws affect relatively pollution-free businesses, such as a 
travel agency or an insurance firm? 
</P>
<P>
A. Perhaps the biggest impact is in the area of real estate. Everyone must 
ensure that the property they are purchasing for their business isn't 
contaminated in any way because, if it is, they might be held liable for some 
of the cleanup even if they weren't responsible for the mess. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You read in the newspaper about somebody getting fined by the EPA or the 
state for something as seemingly innocuous as dumping a can of motor oil. Why? 
</P>
<P>
A. Perhaps they change the oil in a delivery truck. The engine oil in 
particular has some very toxic chemicals. They are created during the 
combustion process in the engine so that the engine oil that you take out of 
your car is more toxic than regular oil. It has a lot of chlorinated 
hydrocarbons in it. There has been plenty of effort at the state and local 
level to set up recycling programs at the local gas stations where people can 
take their used motor oil and deliver it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How do regulators know someone has dumped some oil? 
</P>
<P>
A. Typically there are reporting requirements. If you spill hazardous materials 
on the ground, you need to report that to the local fire department or the 
local county agency, depending on whether you're in a city or a county 
jurisdiction. Probably a lot of small-business owners don't know about those 
requirements so they might get caught because a disgruntled employee knows that 
some dumping went on in the past. But I don't want to underemphasize the 
difficulty in enforcement. It's very difficult to catch. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What common types of pollution emanate from typical businesses? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think we'd be surprised at the number of businesses that do have air 
(pollution) emissions. For instance, utility boilers used to regulate the 
temperature in a building. The South Coast Air Quality Management District 
regulations cover very specific types of sources whether they are furniture 
builders or printing plants. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can you think of a business we might not ordinarily suspect of being a 
polluter? 
</P>
<P>
A. Bakeries have some air emissions. And restaurants have a lot of grease 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Let's say you're a bakery. How do you make sure your air emissions are 
within the limits set by law? Do you have to ask an environmental attorney? 
</P>
<P>
A. The best thing for the very small business to do would be to try to attend 
one of the South Coast District's public workshops to become familiar with 
their rules, just like you might learn about new fire codes affecting your 
business. I think more small businesses have to realize that the environmental 
laws are going to be with them forever. Fire codes didn't exist years ago. 
People don't run out and hire an attorney every time there's a new fire code; 
they call the fire department. Tell the district what your emissions are and 
they will tell you the designated amount allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What if your emissions exceed what's allowed? 
</P>
<P>
A. Hire an air-quality engineer or a land specialist or an expert in whatever 
area you're talking about. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So where do environmental lawyers come into the picture? 
</P>
<P>
A. If you get a notice of violation, I think that would be an indication to 
call an environmental attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think that most small businesses, such as dry cleaners and furniture 
manufacturers, realize that they need to comply with all of these regulations? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think that they're still very much in a reactive mode. Rather than 
developing a relationship with the South Coast district like they have with 
other regulators, they are simply reacting to another regulation. The 
regulators aren't typically as attuned to what a business can and can't do as 
the business itself. So getting involved with the agencies will serve two 
purposes. It will make the regulations more reasonable and increase awareness 
of those regulations. People become aware of these now in a very roundabout way 
and at a very late stage. Some become aware of it when they get a notice of 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The clean air regulations must be several thousand pages from the looks of 
your books. Is it becoming prohibitive for manufacturers to do business in 
Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
A. I know of at least one furniture manufacturer who used to do all its 
production here. Now, the company uses outside contractors for most of its 
coating, painting and foam manufacturing. It simply assembles the product here 
in Orange County. Unfortunately, this is one area where other areas of the 
country may have an advantage over Orange County because they don't have the 
ozone pollution problem. Because there will be no more difficult place than 
Orange County to do business in terms of air quality regulations, you might see 
these operations moving to other parts of the United States or to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Regarding land pollution, what kind of problems do companies encounter 
trying to figure out just how much they need to contribute to the cleanup of a 
dump? 
</P>
<P>
A. As soon as you get a notice that you're involved with property that has been 
contaminated, I think you need to get an environmental lawyer involved unless 
it's extremely minor contamination. What happens is that the EPA or the state 
will eventually get around to notifying the companies that sent waste there. 
These companies are called "potentially responsible parties" or PRPs. The 
earlier in the process you have a lawyer, the better. One person could be held 
liable for the whole amount. So you need to be in there talking about the 
allocation process. Some of these clean-ups can cost $50 million, $100 million 
or $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What can a lawyer do in such a situation? 
</P>
<P>
A. The first step is to study the contamination and determine the best way to 
clean it up. Generally, this involves looking at different options and the 
feasibility of those options. The lawyer's role in that phase of the situation 
is to be sure that the matter is not simply approached as an academic or 
scientific exercise. You want somebody who understands the importance of this 
matter to you and your company, particularly if you're talking about millions 
of dollars. Because when you're comparing one remedy that might cost $100 
million and another costing $30 million, you want a good practical analysis of 
what that $70 million is going to buy you. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So you assume that you may be held responsible for cleaning up the whole 
thing and you want to find out how much that's going to cost? 
</P>
<P>
A. Right. What you try to do is coalesce a group of similarly situated parties. 
Everybody has to understand that today we don't know exactly who's going to pay 
for what or how much. What we do know, however, is that it's in everybody's 
interest to make sure this is a technically competent investigation that can 
lead to not only an environmentally sound result, but a cost-effective result. 
So that's the early stage. As it moves along, you'll get more involved in who 
sent what and are we going to divide this cleanup cost based on volume. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is the majority of your work representing companies who contributed to an 
industrial dump? 
</P>
<P>
A. Only some. For air pollution, we represent any factory, like an automobile 
manufacturing plant, a refinery, a chemical plant or petrochemical plant. For 
land pollution, we work with real estate developers who are having to buy and 
sell land, and financial institutions who are lending money for real estate. 
And then there's a range of clients, such as plastics manufacturers and 
refineries, that have water discharge, processed water that needs to be treated 
and discharged or sent to a municipal sewage plant for similar treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Besides large corporations weaving their way through this maze of 
environmental law, are most of the people who come to you in trouble? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. For the smaller or mid-sized business, it's usually the people that 
have bumped into a problem, receiving a PRP letter from the government that 
says they were a contributor to a dump or a notice of violation. Another thing 
that's occurring quite a bit now is the leaking of underground storage tanks. 
These are underground tanks that held gasoline or diesel or waste oil and are 
located at some pretty small businesses like gas stations or equipment and 
truck rental firms. These steel tanks begin leaking in five years if the soil 
around them is very moist. If the soil conditions are pretty good, you might 
get 20 years out of a tank. But a lot of these tanks have been in the ground 
since 1950 and are leaking like sieves. Many smaller businesses don't know 
about the leaks. The major refiners now have a leak-detection program and have 
actually pulled most of their old tanks and replaced them with fiberglass or 
steel tanks with corrosion protection. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is it true that surrounding businesses might be harmed by these leaking 
tanks? 
</P>
<P>
A. Definitely. What you've got then is a piece of property that's not worth as 
much because nobody is going to want to buy a contaminated property. You're 
going to need to try to get that responsible tank owner-operator to clean up 
your property. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Besides environmental damage, what is the fallout from all this pollution 
for a small business? How high are the chances of having to endure a lengthy 
trial? 
</P>
<P>
A. They usually don't go to trial because the cases settle once everybody 
realizes what the facts are and the lawyers have analyzed the evidence and 
advised their clients. In an environmental problem, there simply is no winner; 
everybody is a loser. It's just a question of how much are you going to pay to 
do an environmentally sound remedy. So it's not typical litigation in which 
somebody walks away with millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are some of the range of fines you've seen? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think to date it's still true that the cleanup costs on the waste side and 
the cost of installation and maintenance of controls for air and water 
pollution far exceed any penalties. But penalties and containment costs are 
rapidly increasing. Typically, with a small business -- because of the direct 
involvement of the officers and directors or stockholders -- there can be some 
personal liability. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the range of fines or penalties? 
</P>
<P>
A. Typically, it's $25,000 a day per violation. Under the Clean Air Act, those 
have added up to as much as $6 million in one case. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the range of cleanup costs? 
</P>
<P>
A. They can range up to hundreds of millions of dollars if you have a large 
site with a lot of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about criminal charges? How often are those filed against company 
officials? 
</P>
<P>
A. Prosecutors need to show company officials were aware of the pollution. I 
would think a CEO, who has taken steps to employ a competent, honest 
environmental manager, wouldn't have to worry. But the environmental manager 
might get charged with a crime if there was pollution. Right now the emphasis 
is on higher fines and actually getting some people in jail. They're focusing 
on the very egregious cases of what we call midnight dumping -- someone who 
just goes out and indiscriminately dumps things -- or repeated violators. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there any insurance available to pay for a cleanup? 
</P>
<P>
A. Insurance is something the small-business person should keep in mind. Many 
businesses carry what we call comprehensive general liability policies. If you 
have a cleanup you're paying for or a problem with underground storage tanks, 
you should always contact your broker and file a claim under your insurance 
policy. If you ask your broker or the insurance company, a lot of times they'll 
say there's no coverage. But if the dollars are big enough, it may be worth 
talking to a lawyer who has expertise in filing environmental claims on general 
liability insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Besides insurance, are there any additional places a company can seek funds 
for a cleanup? 
</P>
<P>
A. The state of California is setting up a fund for the cleanup of leaks from 
underground storage tanks. Unfortunately, I don't think there's any money in 
the fund yet, and I know there are no regulations about how you get the money. 
The majority of states have this fund and you simply have to fill out the 
applications and be able to verify your expenses. You can get all your cleanup 
costs repaid.

FRANCE'S WORKING-CLASS HERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems like only yesterday that Gerard Depardieu was the enfant terrible of 
French film, startling filmgoers with his portrayal of an amoral delinquent in 
"Going Places," Bertrand Blier's outrageous 1974 sex comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Nibbling on pasta at a cozy Hollywood eatery, Depardieu is grumpily bemoaning 
the new generation of lazy, empty-headed French actors. "The young French 
actors are total egomaniacs," he growls in halting English. "These acting 
schools they go to -- all they do is turn them inward, not outward." 
</P>
<P>
Searching for an appropriately scathing image, Depardieu abruptly switches to 
his native tongue. "They've become so self-absorbed," he says in torrid French 
through an interpreter. "In my time, we read the classics. Moliere. 
Shakespeare. Anything we could get our hands on. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if you ask a French actor to recite from Racine, they wouldn't know what 
to do. All they know is Stanislavsky. When I started out 20 years ago, the 
great actors all had a strong theater background. But the young actors today 
only think about film." 
</P>
<P>
He frowns, running a meaty hand through his long mane of hair. "Now our actors 
do one or two movies and -- voila -- they're stars. They want everything 
without doing anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I get letters all the time from parents saying, 'My son loves the acting 
profession.' " 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu flashes a triumphant smile. "So I reply, 'That's wonderful, but does 
the acting craft love him?' " 
</P>
<P>
It's no secret that the camera loves Depardieu. At 41, he is the working-class 
hero of French cinema, as honored and beloved as Jean Gabin, Michel Simon, Yves 
Montand or any other titans of past eras. It's perhaps a sign of his screen 
magnetism that when Peter Weir needed a burst of inspiration to finish his 
script for "Green Card," he simply put a photo of Depardieu on display at his 
desk as he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Though Depardieu made his mark with Blier's raffish satires, the bulky actor 
has played everything from a 16th-Century wanderer in "The Return of Martin 
Guerre" to a baffled modern-day husband in "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine many actors who have ranged so far and wide in the cinema. 
Depardieu was Danton in Andrzej Wajda's compelling account of the French 
Revolution and Rodin in Bruno Nuytten's "Camille Claudel." He also picked up 
best-actor prizes in such films as "The Last Metro" (his only movie with 
Francois Truffaut) and Maurice Pialat's "Police." 
</P>
<P>
American audiences will soon be seeing Depardieu in two of his most formidable 
challenges. He opens Tuesday as the eloquent swordsman hero of "Cyrano de 
Bergerac," which won him the best-actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival. On 
Sunday, he opens in "Green Card," Weir's romantic comedy, which features 
Depardieu in his first major English-language film as a Frenchman who engineers 
a marriage of convenience so he can move to America. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, language was just as much a barrier making "Cyrano" as it was 
in "Green Card." The film, adapted from Edmond Rostand's classic play, was shot 
on location in both Hungary and France, using 2,000 actors and extras. Most of 
the extras were Hungarian. 
</P>
<P>
"That made it very difficult to coordinate everyone's movements during the big 
crowd scenes," he explains. "Since the extras didn't speak French, they didn't 
always know where I was going next. They all look very impressed by my 
speeches, but most of them didn't understand a word I was saying!" 
</P>
<P>
Since the film's dialogue is delivered in Alexandrine verse, which contains 12 
syllables in each line (English verse is commonly 10-syllable iambic 
pentameter), Depardieu found himself choreographing sweeping physical movements 
and sword play to fit the extended lines of verse. 
</P>
<P>
"We rehearsed the film like we would a play," says Depardieu, who spent an hour 
each day having his already ample nose enlarged for the part. "We all sat 
around a table for two weeks and practiced, so we could visualize how it would 
work." 
</P>
<P>
With 60 films to his credit in less than 20 years, Depardieu is an actor who 
seems obsessed with keeping busy. A chunky man with a torso that looks like it 
could support a freeway overpass, he says he enjoys carousing at night -- but 
insists he's always ready for work every morning. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu jokes that the only time he has free time is when he's making a 
movie. "I know it sounds strange, but I like a strict schedule. That's when I 
really feel free." 
</P>
<P>
He's certainly not enthusiastic about doing in-depth interviews to promote his 
films. Out with a reporter on a brief visit here, Depardieu only allows an 
occasional glimpse of the playfulness he displays on movie sets. (He does joke 
about Warren Beatty's legendary sexual exploits, but quickly adds that the jest 
was "in parentheses," apparently a rough translation for off-the-record.) 
</P>
<P>
He apologizes about missing a previous interview, saying he had been worn out 
from a long day of media encounters. "I was exhausted," he says. "And probably 
drunk too." 
</P>
<P>
This time around, accompanied by a pretty young girlfriend who was flying with 
him to Australia, he sticks to mineral water. "It's great for jet lag," he 
advises. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently peeved about a recent Interview feature that he says misquoted him 
as bad-mouthing Robert De Niro ("that's so untrue -- he is a hero to me!"), 
Depardieu is all business. An hour into his interview, he becomes bored and 
restless, signaling an end to the chat by abruptly heading off to his 
limousine. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu may find his publicity labors trying, but it was a series of 
interviews he did in Australia several years ago that got him his part in 
"Green Card." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been writing a romantic comedy about an Englishman who comes to America 
and has to get a green card," explains Peter Weir in a separate interview. "And 
when it wasn't going very well, my wife suggested that I use Gerard as the 
model for the character. So, almost completely on a whim, I wrote the entire 
movie for him. 
</P>
<P>
"After I got started, Gerard came to Sydney for a film festival. I thought of 
calling him up, but I was afraid he might say no. So instead, I took a picture 
of him that ran with an interview he gave in the local paper and kept it on my 
desk as I wrote." 
</P>
<P>
Too nervous to simply send Depardieu's agent the completed script, Weir got on 
a plane, flew to Paris and spent a weekend with the actor at his country house. 
Weir says that the two men took long walks in the fields surrounding 
Depardieu's home, getting to know each other. The fact that Weir speaks French 
with as little confidence as Depardieu handles English was hardly an impediment 
once the creative juices began flowing. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a real rapport from the start," Weir says. "When we had trouble finding 
the right words to explain something, we simply pooled our two languages and 
made them one. We were never embarrassed to use whichever language expressed 
what we were trying to say." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu prefers to work with strong-minded directors who can provide him with 
rich, provocative material. His favorite remains longtime collaborator Blier, 
with whom he has made four films, including "Going Places," "Menage" and "Too 
Beautiful for You." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu was born in a small town in central France that had a nearby U.S. Air 
Force base. Fascinated by American culture, Depardieu went to see rock 'n' roll 
movies, stole blue jeans from laundry lines and hung out at the local train 
station, perfecting his James Dean impression. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young I loved James Dean and Marlon Brando," he recalls. "But I 
liked so many American stars -- Gary Cooper, Robert Mitchum, Alan Ladd." He 
grins mischievously. "Even Victor Mature!" 
</P>
<P>
He insists he was extremely shy as a teen-ager. In fact, he believes his 
youthful timidity served him well as a performer. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been many great actors who stuttered in real life, but once they 
were on stage, they were completely relaxed," he says. "Certain kinds of 
obstacles can be assets, not just defects. There is something in the art of 
acting that transforms these difficulties into strengths and beauties." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu taps his fork on the table. "If you are only macho, like some actors 
you see today, you can't ever be shy. But if you are shy, you can still act 
macho. I am not afraid to show my feminine side -- it's part of what makes me a 
man." 
</P>
<P>
He waves the fork in the air. "Our society wants us to be men with (guts). But 
the greatest thing you can have as a man is to have the (guts) -- and the 
vulnerability too." 
</P>
<P>
Talk of success and celebrity bores him. "Who knows what success is anyway," he 
says. "I'm not a sportsman, trying to better my record. I try to make good 
movies, regardless of whether they make money or not. A good flop is better 
than two ordinary hits anyway." 
</P>
<P>
But are actors held in high regard in France, at least when compared to other 
artists? "The most respected artists are writers," Depardieu concludes after a 
thoughtful silence. "Then come the composers and musicians. After that, the 
film directors. The only actors who really matter are the ones who come along 
and release creative energy." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu throws his hands into the air, mimicking a bomb blast. "They are the 
detonators. They inspire writers to release a blast of creative energy, which 
can make great movies." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu is, of course, too modest to describe himself as such a detonator. 
But hearing him detail his relationship with Blier, it seems that he relishes 
just such a role. 
</P>
<P>
"We make movies together, the way Scorsese does with De Niro," he says. "I 
don't like to just take a script and say, 'OK, I'll do it.' Blier and I are so 
close that he doesn't even have to explain anymore. We know what each other is 
thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Could Depardieu ever reach such instinctive harmony with Weir (who hopes to do 
another film with him) or an American filmmaker? "I hope so," he says. "But 
when it comes to American movies, I have a long way to go, not just because I 
don't understand the language, but because I need to understand the spirit of 
the language. 
</P>
<P>
"But what makes film so beautiful is that it helps you discover so much about 
different cultures. If you see a Bunuel film, you learn about the Spanish and 
their problems with God. If you see a French film, you understand we have our 
problems with sex." 
</P>
<P>
And what has Depardieu discerned about Hollywood films and their vision of 
Americans? "Ah," he says with mock gravity. "You Americans. Your trouble is 
with guilt." 
</P>
<P>
Guilt but not sex? "Oh yes, sex too," he says with a laugh. "But only because 
it makes you feel so guilty!"

From "Pee-Wee's Playhouse" in New York to "Scrooge" in Yorba Linda? 
</P>
<P>
Some might see that as a leap from the extraordinary to the prosaic, but not 
Jeff Raum. He sees the Yorba Linda Civic Light Opera's production of "Scrooge," 
which opens Tuesday, as an opportunity to tap into two sides of his creativity 
at once. The artist who helped develop the surreal environs of television's 
"Playhouse" will perform the title role in the musical production and will 
create the character's distinctive look. 
</P>
<P>
Raum, 30, has done makeup and theatrical design, mostly in New York, for 
several years. Besides transforming a studio into Pee-Wee's playhouse, he 
helped devise much of the elaborate makeup for two major Broadway shows, "I'm 
Not Rappaport" and "Into the Woods." 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys resident manages a company that executes murals, trompe l'oeil and 
other faux finishes for homes and businesses. But he still does occasional 
stage projects. "I just thought ("Scrooge") would be a lot of fun, getting the 
chance to be both a visual artist and a performing artist," he said. "It has 
been great, but a lot of work, too." 
</P>
<P>
Raum spends as much as two hours turning himself from a nice young guy into one 
of the world's sturdiest symbols of mendacity. It takes time to get the 
prosthetic nose just right, then there's the wig to deal with. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The makeup requires a patient hand and attention to detail. "At one point, I go 
out into the audience, so it has to look authentic and hold up to close 
scrutiny. The demands are there," he said. "You can't take it casually." 
</P>
<P>
But the payoff, he continued, is not only a convincing appearance but a 
resonance that the makeup helps bring to his performance. "I really feel my 
personality changing . . . it really clicks when I get the makeup and clothes 
on and feel the character coming through. People have said I'm different during 
dress rehearsals, more real and vivid." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't Raum's first acting role. Although he started feeling early on that 
his talents are more on the technical side, he has acted since high school in 
Cockeysville, a suburb of Baltimore, in professional as well as amateur 
productions of "The Dresser," "A Man for All Seasons," "Twelfth Night" and "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream." 
</P>
<P>
His approach to "Scrooge" is straightforward. "I play him pretty traditionally, 
much the way Dickens' describes him. People go to the show not expecting to see 
something new; they go to see an old friend, so I don't deviate too much from 
what the audience expects." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from the University of Dayton in 1983 with an art degree, Raum 
worked briefly for an advertising firm in Washington, D.C., before moving to 
New York City to join Broadcast Arts, which developed animated television 
commercials and "Pee-Wee's Playhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Though he didn't get a chance to work with Pee-Wee himself, Raum found the 
"Playhouse" job to be a real hoot. "I designed some of the characters, like the 
dinosaur family, the magic screen, Globey and a few others. . . . I enjoyed it 
because it was so off the wall, there was a lot of freedom in the approach." 
</P>
<P>
Raum described his work on "Into the Woods" and "I'm Not Rappaport" as exciting 
and demanding. For "Woods," he applied the makeup for the witch, Rapunzel, the 
wolf and several other key characters; for "Rappaport" he helped age actor Hal 
Linden by about 20 years.

KOLL ANAHEIM CENTER PROJECT GETS AWAY TO A PROMISING START; 
</P>
<P>
 THE PROSPECTUS COMBINES VISION, PRACTICALITY AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
FUNCTION OF PUBLIC ART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Can it be? An Orange County city that knows how to plan wisely for a public art 
program? Well, although there are no guarantees that everything will turn out 
as neatly as planned, the Art Plan for Koll Anaheim Center has three important 
things going for it. 
</P>
<P>
One is a prospectus that reads very seductively, combining vision, practicality 
and a genuine understanding of the function of public art. Another is a fine 
group of artists to work on the first phase, selected by a trio of art-savvy 
folks. 
</P>
<P>
The third, and by no means the least significant thing, is the involvement of 
representatives of the public and private sectors and the art world on the 
nine-member, roll-up-your-sleeves Arts Advisory Committee appointed by the 
Anaheim Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
We've seen how other Orange County cities bungled their first attempts at 
adorning the great outdoors with works of art, by failing to devise a creative 
plan for the community as a whole or to appoint a panel of recognized art 
professionals charged with keeping quality standards high. 
</P>
<P>
Developers in Brea, which has a percentage-for-art ordinance, buy whatever 
pieces of "plop art" catch their fancy, however bland, hokey or unsuited to the 
site they may be. Various individuals in Irvine have loaned a miscellaneous 
array of sculptures to a city that is so humbly grateful, it can't say no. And 
the folks in Laguna Beach seem pretty leery of spending big money on anything 
that might be construed as big-time art. Bring on those dolphin sculptures! 
</P>
<P>
While the Anaheim project has the advantage of starting from scratch, it also 
represents an attempt to integrate art and life in a creative, contemporary way 
-- without denying that its whole reason for existence is to serve the needs of 
the commercial and civic entities sponsoring the project. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of the art is basically supposed to help solve a problem: how to 
get people interested in coming to a soon-to-be-refurbished downtown area to 
spend their money. But that doesn't mean that the art can't be good -- and 
genuinely exciting. In this project, the traditional notion of a bunch of 
free-standing sculptures makes way for a broader conception of what artists can 
do for a community. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the art project -- sited in the area bounded by Lincoln 
Avenue, Broadway, and Anaheim and Harbor boulevards, and due to be completed 
next summer -- will have a budget between $350,000 and $500,0000, based on 
building costs for the new Pacific Bell and City Utilities buildings. 
</P>
<P>
That figure is based on 1% of the "bricks and mortar" construction costs -- a 
percentage-for-art that will be applied to the entire $200-million mixed-use 
commercial enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Artists for the first phase of the project -- Daniel Martinez and Nobuho 
Nagasawa of Los Angeles and Buster Simpson of Seattle -- were chosen by a jury 
of professionals conversant with the contemporary art world as well as the 
problems and pitfalls of public art. (A fourth recommended artist, well-known 
New York sculptor Mary Miss, won't know until later this week whether she'll 
have time to work on the project.) 
</P>
<P>
Members of the jury -- appointed by the the Arts Advisory Board -- are Jessica 
Cusick, arts administrator of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission; 
Linda Forsha, curator at the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art, and Maudette 
Ball, former administrative director of the Urban Arts Program at Foothill 
Ranch in Saddleback Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The artists will be working on several projects intended to encourage 
pedestrian use, enliven the area by day and by night and also serve in some 
fashion as reminders of Anaheim's past. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to free-standing sculpture, the artist-designed elements will 
include such objects as drinking or decorative fountains, benches, trash 
receptacles, pavement ornamentation and lighting. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major art components is a "festivities center" at the western end of 
the center, envisioned as a gathering place for daily use as well as special 
events. The Art Plan suggests three possibilities for the site: a distinctive 
landscape element, a stage for performances, or a combination of both, plus a 
marker commemorating "the ongoing history of Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the artists spent a couple of intensive days checking out the area, 
learning about each other, presenting their previous work to the committee and 
listening to various points of view. I sat in on a couple of the sessions and 
became a believer, both in the artists' work -- previously all but unknown to 
me -- and the public art process, at least as it's being applied this time 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson showed slides of work in a practical but adventurous vein that he has 
done in such far-flung cities as Seattle, Raleigh, N.C., and Cleveland. One 
piece was a "streetscape" that paid homage to the former site of a "historic" 
cherry tree. Another consisted of a set of granite benches for a subway, 
configured to mimic the way the rails sit on the railroad bed, and arranged to 
provide for "social, antisocial and schizophrenic" seating. 
</P>
<P>
A "pre-gentrification" piece by Simpson involved laying a brick trail from a 
neighborhood to a nearby mall so that the worn pieces of brick could be 
permanently installed when the area was redeveloped. "I'm interested in wear," 
Simpson said. "It talks about time." 
</P>
<P>
A temporary "Banner of Human Occupation" consisted of ropes crossing a public 
space between two buildings in a low income housing area. In their bare state, 
the ropes created an aeolian harp effect in the wind; strung like a clothesline 
with sheets and clothing, they represented the kind of close-knit community 
experience "people go to Europe to see," the artist said -- his tongue only 
partly in cheek. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said he "constantly investigates things I don't understand." His 
frankly provocative art is involved with the ways people define themselves and 
the attitudes that lie behind these definitions. One of his favored media is 
the billboard because, he said, "the traditional advertising space moves an 
idea from an elitist place into the public sphere, with a potential for 
creating dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez is working on a piece for the Metro Green Line which, he pointed out, 
runs through the so-called "light" industrial sector of El Segundo -- actually 
the headquarters of such high-level purveyors to the military as Hughes 
Aircraft and McDonnell Douglas. One prominent portion of the piece is a 
40-foot-tall metal image of a giant chain-mailed hand holding a stainless steel 
"paper" airplane like a slingshot. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese-born Nagasawa -- who lived in Europe before coming to the United 
States four years ago -- has a deep awareness of the way such factors as wind, 
rain, drainage, plantings and human activities can influence the look and sound 
of an outdoor work of art. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern Italy, she made a huge, 10-foot-diameter drum (rain does the 
drumming) from bricks donated by a factory and a latex-covered sheet of canvas. 
In Japan, she worked with a landscape architect to create a sensitively sited 
amphitheater with a ring of granite seats, an altar enclosing a symbolic olive 
tree seedling and an entrance framing a view of an island. 
</P>
<P>
"Behind the Great Wall" -- an installation she made for the now-defunct Merging 
One Gallery in Los Angeles earlier this year to commemorate the Tien An Men 
Square massacre -- was a brick wall that extended past the gallery window into 
the street and incorporated the taped sounds of heartbeats, steps, marching and 
a Tibetan chant. 
</P>
<P>
Then the tables were turned, and the advisory committee and the three jurors 
convened again to give their impressions while the artists took notes. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Bay, the Anaheim Arts Council representative, noted that city residents 
are "not a very eclectic group, particularly in the old areas. They tend to 
criticize." She said she hopes the projects could incorporate "as much a degree 
of traditionalism" as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Renner, a member of the board of the Anaheim Museum, echoed Bay's 
concerns: "We do need a traditional kind of approach, rather than avant-garde." 
He said he hoped the project "would not try to alienate the human element with 
something harsh and abstract." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, I began to make faces. How could people involved with the arts 
sound so negative about the adventurous component of the program? Did Renner 
actually think the previous work of the artists in question was "harsh and 
abstract"? 
</P>
<P>
Dextra Frankel, director of the Cal State Fullerton Art Gallery, remarked 
temperately that, "with anything that is new, conservative or vanguard, you 
will get a reaction" but through repeated viewings, people generally begin to 
understand the work. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, it was Cusick's turn. She has worked with public art projects for 
15 years and obviously has been through this sort of thing before. 
</P>
<P>
After congratulating the group for the time it has invested in the project, she 
said pleasantly, "You never know what people are going to react to. It is very 
difficult to define what is traditional. It's different for each one of us. 
It's a real gray area. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes a successful art project is this process. Each of us is an 
ambassador to the community. The major stumbling block in public art is that 
Joe Public doesn't have a starting point (to understand) the artist's thinking, 
the artist's background. I encourage you to provide that access." 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, this is the committee that created the Art Plan. It seems 
to have thought of everything. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, for example, "commercial dealers and private for-profit art 
consultants are not eligible to serve as (jurors)." That was a wise move, 
eliminating accusations of marketplace-based favoritism. Another good sign: The 
artists get to designate the exact locations for the street elements. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also has a way of asking good questions. For example, regarding the 
potential of installing a fountain at the intersection of Lemon Street and 
Harbor Place, the plan wonders aloud just what is most important at that site. 
Is it the sound of the water? The visual dynamic? Participation by passersby 
who could drink from it or wade in it? 
</P>
<P>
In phase two of the project, which would be financed by construction of a 
multiplex cinema, the plan suggests that the art let people actually enjoy 
waiting in line and possibly incorporate lighting, since people mostly go to 
the movies at night. 
</P>
<P>
Phase three of the project would involve the programming of special events -- 
both already established festivals and new ones -- for the site. The publicity 
effort for these events sounds snappy and creative. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps best of all, the plan includes a public education program dealing 
with public art in general and this project in particular, because "the most 
important measure of the success of any public art program lies in its 
acceptance and appreciation by the community it serves."

EARLY 'GODFATHER III' WRITERS FILE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the writers of an early story treatment and screenplay for "The 
Godfather Part III," which Paramount Pictures purchased in 1985, has filed suit 
in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking credit for the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Marino's suit seeks to overturn a Writers Guild of America arbitration 
ruling that denied him and his partner, Thomas Lee Wright, credit for the film, 
which will open in 1,800 theaters on Christmas Day. The Writers Guild 
arbitration committee decided that producer-director Francis Ford Coppola and 
Mario Puzo should receive full on-screen credit. "Godfather III" is the sequel 
to their screenplays for "The Godfather" and "The Godfather Part II." 
</P>
<P>
Marino said that he and Wright, a former Paramount production executive, 
originally wrote a treatment on speculation during a time when Coppola was not 
involved with the project. When the studio accepted the treatment, it 
commissioned Marino and Wright to write a screenplay for which the pair was 
paid $35,000, with the stipulation that if the movie was made they would 
receive an additional $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Marino called the payment "embarrassingly low." The two writers were locked 
into selling the script only to Paramount, Wright said, since the studio had 
produced the first two "Godfathers." 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who wrote the screenplay for the upcoming Warner Bros. picture "New 
Jack City," had no comment when asked about his non-participation in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Marino's suit names Coppola, Puzo and the East Coast and West Coast branches of 
the Writers Guild of America. It claims that in conducting its arbitration 
proceedings, the guild "failed to apply its own arbitration rules," including 
the rules of anonymity. Under those rules, scripts are submitted to arbitration 
without the writer's name attached. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the guild had no comment on the suit. Puzo and Coppola could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In late August, the guild notified Marino and Wright and six other individuals, 
including Coppola and Puzo, that it would conduct an arbitration to determine 
the screenwriting credit. Guild rules provide for automatic arbitration when a 
production executive is designated for a writer's credit, and director Coppola 
had been designated by Paramount to receive co-writing credit. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Marino and Wright notified the guild that they wanted screenplay 
credit, contending that the final script of the movie was based on their work. 
In November, the arbitration committee ruled in favor of Coppola and Puzo. 
</P>
<P>
Marino and Wright claim that they sought anonymity during the arbitration.

49ERS MAKING ANOTHER RUN AT RAMS; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: SAN FRANCISCO, WHICH IGNITED ITS GROUND GAME LAST WEEK, TRIES TO AVENGE 
ITS ONLY DEFEAT TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Having rediscovered their running game, their zest for late-season charges and 
their ability to rely on Joe Montana in clutch situations, the San Francisco 
49ers get a chance on prime-time television to rediscover a way to beat the 
Rams, the team that wrecked their try for perfection. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, the 49ers come to their home-away-from-home, Anaheim Stadium (where 
Montana is 8-0 in games he has started), with a 12-1 record and the vivid 
recollections of their 28-17 loss to the Rams at Candlestick Park three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Lott, their Pro Bowl safety and emotional bonfire, injured his knees two 
weeks ago and could require surgery that would put him out for the season. But 
the 49ers' machine just rolls on, popping new bodies into the void and eager to 
banish all thoughts of 1990's only blemish. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for really the first time all season, the 49ers cranked out a 
powerful running attack in their overtime defeat of the Cincinnati Bengals, 
piling up more than 200 yards and re-energizing the battered body of tailback 
Roger Craig, who gained 97 of his own. Of course, they won it in the end on a 
couple of Montana-led late-game drives, but what's the news in that? 
</P>
<P>
Before last week, the 49er offense was strictly airborne, a method that crashed 
and burned when the Rams played a four-safety "big nickel" defense most of the 
game, switched their coverages relentlessly to confuse Montana, clogged up the 
passing lanes and dared the 49ers to run. 
</P>
<P>
After last week, the 49ers are running, and the Rams know that they'll have to 
do something vastly different this week in order to keep the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
"They won the (Cincinnati) ballgame, and that's what the 49ers do extremely 
well," said Fritz Shurmer, the Rams' defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"They win. They find a way to win the ballgame, whether it's last week running 
the ball 40 times for over 200 yards or it's with Joe with the ball in his 
hands on the last drive. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the thing that makes them great. Or if they've got to win one, 7-3, 
like they did (against the New York Giants), win it with their defense. That's 
what this team is. This team is a great football team that has a great capacity 
to be able to do whatever they need to do to win the football game. And if 
they've got to run 40 times to do it, they do it. And if they've got to throw 
it 50 times, they'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
The last time these two teams met in Anaheim, it took perhaps Montana's finest 
single-game performance ever to beat the Rams. Trailing, 24-10, going into the 
final quarter, Montana put 20 points on the board in that quarter, and passed 
for 458 yards overall to lead the 49ers to a stunning 30-27 victory. 
</P>
<P>
That was just the latest chapter in Montana and the 49ers' tradition of 
walloping their Orange County hosts. Montana, in his eight games at Anaheim, 
has averaged 321.5 yards of passing and thrown for a total of 17 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why that happens," Craig said. "But we can't go off the history 
of saying we win down there all the time so it's going to be a cakewalk for us. 
No, the Rams will be fired up. And they have more incentive now to play us than 
the first time they played us this year." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams limp into this game out of the playoff picture for the first time in 
three seasons. So, at 5-8, they are clutching at one final goal for 1990: 
</P>
<P>
Mess up the 49ers' season as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the league doesn't quite seem to be up to knocking off the two-time 
defending Super Bowl champions, who are vying with the Chicago Bears and the 
Giants for home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, but another Rams' 
victory almost certainly would do away with that air of 49er invincibility. If 
the Rams can sweep the 49ers, why can't a team with a winning record? 
</P>
<P>
"It'd be great, it'd be great for us," Ram defensive end Doug Reed said. 
"Knowing that we beat them twice (with another victory tonight). I think that's 
what it's all about at this point. Beating them and playing a hell of a 
football game." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, by the way, not only are quite comfortable in Anaheim Stadium, but 
everywhere: they have won 16 consecutive road games dating to 1988, and it's 18 
in a row if you count their two neutral site Super Bowl victories in that span. 
</P>
<P>
So don't ask Ram Coach John Robinson why the 49ers play so well in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no explanation for it," Robinson said. "I just don't know. That 
question has been asked, (but) I have no idea. The 49ers have played well in a 
lot of stadiums, what, 18 in a row, some number that's way out there. Fabulous. 
They don't lose on the road." 
</P>
<P>
One thing Robinson can explain is the most underestimated part of the 49ers' 
team: Their defense. In their last meeting, the Rams piled up 350 yards against 
the 49ers, whose best defensive player, linebacker Charles Haley, was banged 
up. Haley is injury-free now and leading the NFC with 14 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have the seventh-rated defense overall and are the No. 2 defense 
against the rush. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they have a great defensive team," Robinson said. "I can't imagine why 
people don't talk about what they've done. I guess people don't understand . . 
. what they've done defensively because they tend not to be individuals, they 
tend to be a group. 
</P>
<P>
"They're so much better than any other defense that I've dealt with over a 
period of time. There's been periods when other defenses have risen and such, 
but this is a consistently outstanding defense. And in big games, they play 
marvelous football. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take the time . . . you look back at their defensive record, in the 
games that were really big, they were phenomenal. Sometimes the other team 
scored, but it was usually in the last quarter when they were ahead by along 
ways. It's a very impressive group." 
</P>
<P>
Even without Lott? Last week, with Lott out, veteran Dave Waymer moved over to 
free safety and Johnny Jackson started at strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, he's missed some games," Robinson said. "I think it's a major blow to 
them, but they're used to it. They've never lost a game with him out, so I 
think they'll survive." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Coach George Seifert says he isn't a bit surprised that his 
former boss, Bill Walsh, is the subject of speculation about a number of 
coaching jobs. "I don't believe any of us are surprised by any of it," Seifert 
said. "He's one of the great coaches ever to coach in this game and probably 
did as fine a job as has been done as far as putting together a team and 
building it into the type of organization, along with Eddie (DeBartolo), our 
owner, as has been done over the years." . . . The Rams are 17-17 overall on 
Monday nights; the 49ers are 15-12. . . . The Rams' 5-8 record is their worst 
through 13 game since 1981, when they also started 5-8. To find a worse Ram 
record through 13 games, you have to go all the way back to 1965, when they 
started 3-10.

SPOTLIGHT / A GLANCE AT THIS WEEK IN THE NFL; 
</P>
<P>
PARTIAL ECLIPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warren Moon was enjoying the second-best passing day in NFL history, the 
Houston quarterback having thrown for 527 yards against the Kansas City Chiefs. 
The Oilers had the game well in hand, but there was still plenty of time left 
for Moon to eclipse Norm Van Brocklin's 1951 record of 554 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Should Moon have gone for the record? You make the call. 
</P>
<P>
Moon and the Oilers made theirs, electing to run out the clock in a 27-10 
victory without putting the ball in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone watching NBC's telecast of the game knows how broadcasters Don Criqui 
and Bob Trumpy felt. They wanted Moon to go for it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what records are there for," Criqui said, "to be broken." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like this," Trumpy moaned. "How often do you get in a position to 
break a record from 1951?" 
</P>
<P>
Moon knew he was within striking distance of the record. 
</P>
<P>
"But I was not going to throw the ball just so I would have gotten the record," 
he said. "Records are not important to me." 
</P>
<P>
When people say Moon is a classy quarterback, they aren't just talking about 
his skill. 
</P>
<P>
WAKE UP THE BACKUPS 
</P>
<P>
The Buffalo Bills and New York Giants are headed for the playoffs, but they 
will have to struggle for first-round byes without quarterbacks Jim Kelly and 
Phil Simms. 
</P>
<P>
Both were KOd in Saturday's 17-13 Buffalo victory and will miss at least two 
weeks -- the remainder of the regular season. A bye would give them a third 
week to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
So the Bills (12-2) and Giants (11-3) will press on. With Kelly and Simms out, 
the quarterback burden falls to Frank Reich for Buffalo and Jeff Hostetler for 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills' Kelly went down first, twisting his left knee when offensive lineman 
Will Wolford was pushed into him following a pass play. The preliminary 
diagnosis, pending further tests scheduled for today, was a sprained ligament 
that would keep him out from two to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, in my mind, I'll be ready for the first playoff game," Kelly said 
on NBC Sunday. If the Bills beat Miami next Sunday, he said, "Then we'll get 
the bye and I'll have enough time to rest and get ready." 
</P>
<P>
How's that for incentive? 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said the knee was sore and swollen Sunday. "They told me to keep it 
elevated and keep weight off it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Kelly went out, Simms suffered a sprained right foot when he was sacked 
by Leon Seals. The foot was taped at halftime but he came out of the game for 
keeps after attempting a third quarter pass to Dave Meggett. 
</P>
<P>
"I was turning to throw to the right," he said, "and it felt like somebody shot 
me. I heard it click." 
</P>
<P>
That finished his day and Simms left Giants Stadium on crutches, with his foot 
in a cast. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Coach Bill Parcells got a bad report from team doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a guess at the moment," Parcells said. "I think we'll have to 
wait until midweek to be more conclusive, but my best guess now is he is out 
for the regular season and possibly longer. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you lose your starting quarterback, it's a big loss. It's part of the 
game and you can't dwell on it." 
</P>
<P>
Reich was 3-0 last year when Kelly was out with a separated shoulder and played 
so well he was rewarded with a five year $2.5 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
Hostetler completed nine of 16 passes for 97 yards against the Bills after 
Simms went down. He has started only two games in six-plus seasons in the NFL, 
but the last one was a year ago in Phoenix, where he beat the Cardinals and 
where he returns as the starter next week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
Randall Cunningham became the first Philadelphia quarterback to throw for more 
than 3,000 yards in three consecutive years. . . . Cunningham has also rushed 
for 828 yards. . . . Philadelphia took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter on Keith 
Byars' eight-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Toney. It was Byars' third pass 
this season, his third completion and his third touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Vinny Testaverde's 105 yards rushing in seven carries was the most ever by a 
Buccaneer quarterback. Mike Rae gained 98 yards in four attempts against the 
Rams in 1978. Testaverde's 48-yard touchdown run was the longest run by a 
quarterback in Buccaneers' history. . . . The Vikings lost for the ninth 
consecutive time outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Marino has 3,084 yards passing and joins Joe Montana as the only players in 
NFL history to have seven seasons of passing for 3,000 or more yards. Marino, 
in his eighth year, also moved past Norm Snead into 10th place on the NFL 
all-time career passing yardage list. Marino ended the contest with 30,937 
yards. . . . Marino's four-yard touchdown pass to James Pruitt in the second 
quarter was the 237th of his career, breaking a tie with George Blanda for 
seventh place in that category. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Dickerson of Indianapolis rushed for 117 yards, the 60th time he has run 
for at least 100 yards. Walter Payton had 77 100-yard games. . . . Rookie 
quarterback Troy Taylor made his NFL debut for the New York Jets, coming off 
the bench to throw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Rob Moore in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas has won four games in a row for the first time since 1985. The Cowboys 
now own the longest current winning streak in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland sacked Atlanta's Scott Campbell three times and Hugh Millen five 
times. The eight sacks were the most by the Browns since they had nine against 
Philadelphia on Oct. 16, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's Mark Carrier tied a team record with his ninth interception. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOUGH GUY, TOUGH DAY 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't enough that Kansas City quarterback Steve DeBerg had to watch Warren 
Moon's record-setting performance, see the Chiefs fall out of first place in 
the AFC West and have his string of passes without an interception ended. He 
also suffered a broken finger, but kept playing. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, what they said was, 'If you can deal with the pain then you can 
play.' It's broken at the tip, so it's already broke," DeBerg said. 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg had a pass intercepted by Richard Johnson with 2:20 left, his first 
interception in 234 attempts, second only to Bart Starr's streak of 294. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THAT TOUCH OF MINK 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Falcon Coach Jerry Glanville wore defensive back Deion Sanders' mink 
coat during warmups for Sunday's game against the Browns at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had anything that expensive on before," Glanville said. "I thought I'd 
slip it on one time, and Deion was good enough to let me do it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sanders: "He probably has a hundred furs at home." 
</P>
<P>
Glanville and the Falcons would have been better off at home. They lost, 13-10, 
their 18th consecutive defeat on the road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City linebacker Derrick Thomas on Warren Moon's 527-yard passing game 
against the Chiefs: "One of the most unbelievable, incredible, awesome displays 
any quarterback ever put on." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer: "I would have bet my house that Warren 
Moon wouldn't throw for 500 yards against our defense. I'm glad I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota receiver Hassan Jones on the Vikings' 26-13 loss to Tampa Bay: "We 
didn't play like our season was on the line, even though it was." 
</P>
<P>
Packer Coach Lindy Infante, whose team fell to 6-8: "Until someone from the 
league office calls us and says we're out of it, we'll keep on trying." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's Bernie Kosar on the crowd of 46,536, the smallest for a home game 
in which Kosar has been the quarterback: "In my career, I haven't gotten too 
caught up in looking up in the stands and watching what's going on around me 
once the game starts. When you're playing at a solid level, you really block 
out the peripheral things." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Dickerson, who rushed for 117 yards against the New York Jets: "One 
hundred yards is OK, but it's no big deal to me, I've done it so much. I 
haven't even had an Eric Dickerson day this year." 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis quarterback Jeff George on Dickerson: "Eric is unbelievable. Eric 
Dickerson has nothing to prove to anybody. He is by far the best running back 
who ever lived." 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans Coach Jim Mora on quarterback Steve Walsh, who completed only eight 
of 26 passes for 95 yards in a 9-6 loss to Pittsburgh: "He probably could have 
played better, but I'm sure there were other players on our football team that 
could have played better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RIDE HIM, COWBOYS 
</P>
<P>
In a check of the NFL standings this morning, the most surprising item would 
have to be the Dallas Cowboys' 7-7 record, keeping them in the thick of the 
playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
Mention the Cowboys' resurgence from a 1-15 season and the first name that 
usually comes to mind is quarterback Troy Aikman, but rookie running back 
Emmitt Smith has been having an outstanding season. 
</P>
<P>
Smith scored four rushing touchdowns Sunday in a 41-10 victory over the Phoenix 
Cardinals, tying a club record set by Calvin Hill in 1971 against Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has rushed for 842 yards, also became one of only five Cowboys to 
score four touchdowns in a game. The others were Dan Reeves, Bob Hayes and 
Duane Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big day for the team, the coaching staff and the city of Dallas," 
Smith said. "And I think we can get better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Andre Rison was carried off on a stretcher with a sprained left knee 
sustained while making an 11-yard catch in the final minute, but the Falcons 
said he would probably be able to play next week. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay quarterback Anthony Dilweg, himself replacing the injured Don 
Majkowski, was knocked out of the game with 5:17 left with a sprained arch 
after a hit by Reggie White and replaced by Blair Kiel. 
</P>
<P>
Denver lost two of its top defensive players, safety Steve Atwater (with a rib 
injury) and linebacker Simon Fletcher (ankle). 
</P>
<P>
Chicago quarterback Jim Harbaugh suffered a dislocated right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Munoz, Cincinnati's All-Pro offensive tackle, suffered a sprained left 
shoulder in the second quarter and didn't return. There was no announcement as 
to the severity of the injury.

SUDDENLY, TIM BROWN IS MAKING THIRD DOWNS HIS OWN; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: THE FORMER HEISMAN WINNER, NEGLECTED FOR MOST OF THE SEASON, CATCHES 
TWO TOUCHDOWN PASSES AGAINST THE BENGALS, GIVING HIM THREE IN TWO GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Raider tailback Marcus Allen had a premonition before Sunday's game against the 
Cincinnati Bengals that wide receiver Tim Brown would play well. 
</P>
<P>
"Marcus has been my inspirational leader," Brown said. "He's been telling me to 
hang in there." 
</P>
<P>
His confidence bolstered by Allen, Brown caught two touchdown passes as the 
Raiders defeated the Bengals, 24-7, at the Coliseum to clinch their first 
playoff berth since the 1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
Brown caught a five-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jay Schroeder to tie 
the score, 7-7, in the first quarter. Brown scooped up a low pass from 
Schroeder at the goal line for his second touchdown reception of the season. It 
was the same play on which Brown scored a three-yard touchdown in last Monday 
night's 38-31 victory over the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Brown added a 44-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter to give the 
Raiders a 14-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
On third and three at the Bengal 44, Brown caught a pass at the 32 and outran a 
defender to the end zone. The Bengals left Brown in single coverage because 
they double-covered wide receivers Willie Gault and Mervyn Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a simple end route over the middle and I was supposed to hook it up the 
field," Brown said. "But there was a linebacker sitting where I was supposed to 
hook it up and I decided to keep on sliding and Jay stayed with me. Mervyn was 
supposed to run an in route and he ran an out and it opened up the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who had only 14 catches for 170 yards and one touchdown coming into the 
contest, had his most productive game this season, catching three passes for 69 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown almost set up a Cincinnati touchdown when he fumbled a punt at the 
Raider 44. However, the Raider defense thwarted the drive when Terry McDaniel 
intercepted a pass from quarterback Boomer Esiason in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough because (Bengal punter Lee Johnson) is left-footed and the ball 
takes off right and then slashes back to the left," Brown said. "I just didn't 
stay with it long enough." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the 1987 Heisman Trophy winner, made an instant impact after he was 
drafted by the Raiders in 1988. He was the NFL's best kick returner, he led the 
Raiders with 43 catches for 725 yards and made the Pro Bowl. He broke Gale 
Sayers' record for most total yardage by a rookie, compiling 2,316 yards on 
receptions, rushes, kickoff and punt returns. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown's 1989 season came to an abrupt end in the opener when he tore 
ligaments in his left knee while returning a kickoff against the San Diego 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors re-attached one of the ligaments to a hamstring and stapled another 
ligament to allow it to mend back to the bone. The staple was removed after 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
It was a devastating injury for Brown because the medial collateral and 
posterior cruciate ligaments enable the knee to withstand quick cuts, and quick 
cuts enabled Brown to elude defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"Early on I had doubts about whether I'd be able to come back and cut and run 
like I was able to before I got hurt," Brown said. "But after February I was 
able to cut and spin again without any problems. I can play this game at 4.5 
(speed in the 40-yard dash), but I can't do it without my moves. Once I stepped 
on the football field, I wasn't worried." 
</P>
<P>
During Brown's absence, Fernandez emerged as the Raiders' top receiver last 
season and Brown was relegated to a backup role when he returned. The Raiders' 
No. 3 receiver this season behind Fernandez and Gault, Brown has been employed 
as an extra wide receiver in third-down situations. 
</P>
<P>
"Mervyn had such a great year that it was tough for me to come back and say, 'I 
want my job back,' " Brown said. "And Willie is Willie. He's going to go out 
and beat people deep and do the things that Al (Davis) likes him to do. Right 
now I'm a third-down guy. I try to come in on third down and help the team 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Because teams have concentrated on stopping Gault and Fernandez, Brown has 
emerged as a potent weapon, catching three touchdown passes in the past two 
games after failing to catch a touchdown pass in the Raiders' first 12 games. 
All of Brown's touchdown receptions have come on third down. 
</P>
<P>
"Willie and Mervyn are playing so great that teams haven't been thinking about 
me," Brown said. "They've been double-teaming them and leaving me one-on-one. 
Now they're going to have to put six or seven defensive backs on field just to 
cover everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Although he went five games without catching a pass, Brown remained patient. 
</P>
<P>
"It was easy to stay patient because we were winning," Brown said. "It would 
have been a lot more difficult if we weren't winning games. But we started out 
the year 4-0 and then we went to 6-1 and it's tough to be complaining when your 
team is doing well. If it's my job not to catch any passes I've got to bide my 
time and go on. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never accepted my role, but you just have to adjust. I want to play every 
down, but right now my role is to go out and play on third down." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder isn't surprised that Brown has started to produce. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim's been the forgotten man all year," Schroeder said. "It's nice to see him 
get involved. We've been struggling all year trying to get everybody involved 
in the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's got his confidence back. It's tough to keep your confidence up 
when things aren't going well and you don't feel like you're a part of it. 
Coming out of college he was used to making every play. Let's just get him the 
ball and see if he can make some plays. He's proved that he can make some big 
plays."

HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
ITSALLGREEKTOME ECLIPSES FIELD IN THE TURF CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Itsallgreektome's fifth stakes victory of the year, in Sunday's $500,000 
Hollywood Turf Cup, could lead to another big prize in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old gelding's one-length victory in a 14-horse Grade I race enhanced 
his chances of winning the Eclipse Award as the nation's top turf performer. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody can question his credentials. He was first, second or third in nine 
consecutive stakes, lost by a neck to Royal Academy in the Breeders' Cup Mile, 
then raced 1 1/2 miles for the first time Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"(An Eclipse) would be nice," said trainer Wallace Dollase, still beaming after 
his biggest success. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be the cream. He's beaten some awfully good horses, he's gone 1 1/2 
miles and went a brilliant mile. Who else can say they've done that? 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's got to be right there. And this is an iron horse. You've got to 
call him an iron horse to run as often (12 times this year) and consistently as 
he has. I've got to find something to knock on because he's also been able to 
remain 100% sound. I give this animal a lot of credit. No doubt about it, he's 
something special." 
</P>
<P>
Ridden perfectly by Corey Nakatani, Dollase's son-in-law, Itsallgreektome saved 
ground early after breaking from the rail, was taken to the outside down the 
backstretch, began to rally around the final turn, led by a length with a 
furlong to run and finished in 2:24 4/5, breaking the Turf Cup record of 2:25 
4/5 set by Alphabatim in 1986 and three-fifths off Rivlia's course record. He 
paid $7 as the 5-2 favorite and earned $275,000 for his 83-year-old owner, 
Jheri Redding. 
</P>
<P>
"What a ride," Dollase said. "That's what I was worried about with all those 
horses. With all those horses, how was this horse coming from out of it going 
to be lucky enough to get through? Corey just moved him on the backside and was 
sitting perfect then. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse has a terrific three-eighths of a mile run in him. He has a lot of 
patience and when you ask him, he goes. He gives you everything he's got. 
Today, he just ran right on by them. It was a perfectly timed ride." 
</P>
<P>
Nakatani hasn't done much wrong on the gray son of Sovereign Dancer, and at 20, 
he has become a veteran in the world's strongest jockey colony. The Turf Cup 
was his 20th victory of the meeting, placing him fourth in the Hollywood Park 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, he was a little bit rank, but because he's such a nice horse 
he came right back to me," Nakatani said. "Going down the backside, I just 
wanted to get position and he relaxed just the way he always does. When I asked 
him to pick it up, he just took off. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never a question in my mind about the distance. I knew the horse was 
fit and I knew there wasn't a horse in the race who could run with him. I think 
he should get the Eclipse Award." 
</P>
<P>
Mashkour, a 20-1 shot who had been beaten by a head while carrying a $125,000 
claiming price in his last race at Oak Tree, came from far back to gain the 
place, finishing two lengths ahead of 11-1 shot Live The Dream. A head back in 
fourth was pacesetter Fly Till Dawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to check pretty hard at the three-eighths pole, and if that hadn't 
happened, it would have been a better horse race than it turned out to be," 
said Mashkour's rider, Chris McCarron. "He was coming out of some cheaper 
races, but he's legitimate. He got beat by a head by Rial at Del Mar and that 
horse came back to win some nice stakes. (Mashkour has) run some productive 
races and he should have been closer today." 
</P>
<P>
Although he won't be leaving Hollywood Park, Itsallgreektome will be taking a 
vacation. The San Francisco Mile, March 23, at Golden Gate Fields probably will 
be his 4-year-old debut. 
</P>
<P>
Rial was fifth in the Turf Cup, then came Hodges Bay. 
</P>
<P>
With six days remaining, Gary Jones is firmly entrenched atop the Hollywood 
Park trainer standings. He has 13 winners from 41 starters, putting him three 
ahead of Bill Spawr. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most encouraging development for Jones has been the emergence of 
Tabaman. 
</P>
<P>
A full brother to Turkoman, the 3-year-old didn't show a thing in his first two 
starts -- finishing 11th and sixth -- improved in his third race, around two 
turns, finishing 2 1/2 lengths behind in second. He went to the sidelines after 
that March 4 race and didn't return until Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Since coming back, Tabaman has been a different animal. He blitzed maidens by 
four lengths, then Saturday he defeated another highly regarded colt, High 
Energy, by more than a length in a fast 1:21 2/5 for seven furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
"He was too big and too soft (earlier this year)," Jones said. "He just needed 
a lot of time. He's come back a different horse." 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron, who has ridden Tabaman in three of his five starts, also 
notices a huge difference. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really matured a lot," he said. "He was something of a clown before. He 
didn't really want to put out everything he had. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has really helped him a lot. He's just the opposite of his brother

survive a stewards' inquiry. . . . Chris McCarron had two victories Sunday, 
running his total for the meeting to 48 and putting him 14 ahead of runner-up 
Alex Solis. . . . Festin ran the fastest 1 1/16 miles of the meeting when he 
won the seventh in 1:41 4/5 as the 4-5 favorite. . . . Timebank, another 
talented 3-year-old trained by Gary Jones, will be sidelined for a couple of 
months. He was second to Frost Free in the Vernon O. Underwood Nov. 24 in his 
last start. Jones also said Quiet American probably will make his 1991 debut in 
the San Pasqual Handicap, Feb. 3, at Santa Anita.

AMERICAN TO GET KEY TWA ROUTES FOR $515 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: CARL C. ICAHN'S CARRIER ALSO MAKES ITS SECOND BID IN A MONTH FOR 
AILING PAN AM -- THIS TIME FOR $375 MILLION.

<P>
Seeking to raise badly needed cash, Trans World Airlines said Sunday that it 
had agreed to sell all of its London routes and other assets to American 
Airlines for $515 million. Simultaneously, TWA made a new offer to acquire 
ailing Pan American World Airways for $375 million. 
</P>
<P>
The two moves further illustrate how weak U.S. airlines are getting weaker and 
stronger carriers are taking advantage of it. Struggling TWA said it needs to 
merge with Pan Am to help ensure both carriers' survival. And the sale to 
American of some of TWA's most coveted routes will make American an even 
stronger force internationally, while giving TWA cash to finance the Pan Am bid 
and survive the economic downturn. 
</P>
<P>
TWA had offered to buy Pan Am last month for $450 million, but the overture was 
quickly rejected because Pan Am felt it could go it alone following an 
agreement to sell its London routes to United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered Sunday to Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett, TWA 
Chairman Carl C. Icahn offered to enter into a definitive merger agreement with 
Pan Am in which TWA would pay $1.50 per share in cash and $1 per share of 
either a preferred stock or a promissory note. 
</P>
<P>
A Pan Am spokesman said "the letter was received too late on Sunday, so there 
is nothing we can say tonight." 
</P>
<P>
In its earlier unsuccessful bid, TWA offered $1 in cash and $2 in stock or 
notes for each share of Pan Am stock. Analysts were skeptical of the TWA 
proposal because of the low cash offering. 
</P>
<P>
In its deal with TWA, American agreed to buy for $445 million certain TWA 
routes between London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports and six U.S. cities, 
including Los Angeles. The routes agreement is subject to Department of 
Transportation approval. 
</P>
<P>
American also agreed to purchase from TWA for another $70 million a total of 40 
landing slots and three gates at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and 
some other facilities. American hopes the deal will enhance its competitive 
position in Chicago, its second-largest domestic hub, where it now runs second 
behind archrival United. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, TWA and American will mesh their frequent flier programs. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas-Ft. Worth-based American said it planned to finance the transaction by 
the sale of common stock in the first quarter of next year. 
</P>
<P>
The TWA-American deal continues a trend whereby strong carriers are gaining "by 
taking advantage of the current environment in which the financially ailing 
carriers need to raise cash to maintain their viability," said Hans J. 
Plickert, an airline analyst with the Transportation Group, an affiliate of 
Paine Webber, the New York-based investment house. 
</P>
<P>
But Plickert added that the current American-TWA deal and others like it might 
provide cash transfusions to allow weaker carriers to survive. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been predicting that some of the weaker carriers -- and TWA is one 
of these -- will not survive," Plickert said. "Now their disappearance is not a 
given." 
</P>
<P>
Icahn said that while he was "reluctant" to part with the London routes, "over 
the last two years earnings from these routes have seriously deteriorated." 
Icahn said those earnings "will almost certainly continue to erode," thanks to 
new competition brought on by United's recent agreement to buy Pan Am's London 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn said cash from the sale of the routes would "generate additional cash . . 
. which will enable us to position ourselves for growth, despite these 
extremely difficult times." 
</P>
<P>
Icahn, who owns all but about 10% of TWA stock, said that in addition to the 
Pan Am offer, he is continuing his talks with bankers and creditors to buy 
bankrupt Eastern Airlines' Atlanta hub and its Miami maintenance base. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the sale to American involves routes to London's Heathrow Airport, a 
development bound to perpetuate a major controversy. Under bilateral agreements 
between the United States and Great Britain, only TWA and Pan Am are 
specifically mentioned as being allowed to use Heathrow, the major British 
gateway to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Because Heathrow is so congested, the British have attempted not to transfer 
the route authority there from one U.S. carrier to another. Instead, it has 
insisted that any new routes go into Gatwick Airport. Gatwick, though closer to 
downtown London, doesn't have as large a European feed. Talks on the subject 
are under way between the two governments. 
</P>
<P>
A similar situation exists in Pan Am's agreement to sell certain routes to 
United Airlines for $290 million. Pan Am also sold United two Boeing 747 
jetliners, making the entire transaction worth about $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued late Sunday, American Chairman Robert L. Crandall said 
the purchase "will enable us to become a more effective competitor on both 
transatlantic and domestic routes." 
</P>
<P>
American is fast becoming a vast global airline. It already had routes to Asia 
and Europe, and earlier this year purchased Eastern Airlines' Latin American 
routes. Recently it greatly expanded its operations to the Caribbean. American 
has a fleet of 546 planes and operates 2,400 flights a day to 184 destinations 
worldwide. It has 81,000 employees and another 500 planes on order or option. 
</P>
<P>
An American spokesman said the announcement was made so late on Sunday because 
the negotiations with the Icahn group "were not completed and signed until the 
last minute." 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1989, American had agreed to acquire the Chicago-London route from 
TWA but that transaction has yet to be approved by the Transportation 
Department. It is not known why it has been held up so long. 
</P>
<P>
In the deal announced Sunday, American said it also will acquire TWA routes 
between Heathrow and Boston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Newark and New York's 
Kennedy International Airport. It also gives American Airlines routes between 
Gatwick Airport and St. Louis and Baltimore-Washington.

OFFICIALS WARY OF CHEVRON'S PLAN TO PUMP AT ARGUELLO 
</P>

Chevron Corp.'s announcement last month that it would start up oil production 
at its long-idle Point Arguello offshore project has raised questions among 
wary local officials who wonder if the oil company plans to try to circumvent 
local opposition to tanker shipments. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron, which leads a consortium of 18 oil companies, decided to fire up the 
$2.5-billion project in part to break an impasse with Santa Barbara County, 
which has so far turned down applications to ship the project's oil by tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Chevron said it would move 20,000 barrels of oil a day by pipeline 
from the project to refineries in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties or farther 
north. 
</P>
<P>
But some officials in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties are asking 
whether the project's sponsors really intend to ship the oil to ports in San 
Luis Obispo County, where it would be loaded onto tankers and shipped out. That 
would effectively circumvent Santa Barbara County and its objections 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal Corp., which operates the Avila Beach marine terminal near San Luis 
Obispo, was concerned enough about local reports intimating such a move that it 
issued a statement this week denying it. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron spokesmen also flatly denied any intention to get around the Santa 
Barbara County ban or to ship oil by tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, a prominent Santa Barbara County official has publicly questioned 
whether Chevron genuinely plans to pursue construction of a pipeline that would 
follow the old Southern Pacific Railroad right of way to bring Point Arguello 
oil to Los Angeles-area refineries. 
</P>
<P>
In its application to Santa Barbara County, Chevron had promised to ship oil by 
tanker only temporarily, saying it was aggressively pursuing the pipeline 
option. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tom Rogers, chairman of the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors, 
said he was told in a meeting with Assistant Secretary of the Interior David 
O'Neal "that Chevron's plans for a pipeline along the Southern Pacific route 
were dead, and since we had been leaning on that issue, we were shocked." 
</P>
<P>
A consultant to O'Neal who attended the meeting, former Santa Barbara County 
Supervisor Robert Kallman, confirmed Rogers' account. But Kallman said he and 
O'Neal were merely passing on rumors about the pipeline project. O'Neal could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron insists that it remains committed to such a pipeline, which it 
considers the likeliest prospect among a number of pipeline options for moving 
the offshore oil to refineries. 
</P>
<P>
But, added Larry Perkins, a project coordinator for Chevron in Walnut Creek: 
"The pipeline is not developed enough to the point where we could say it's a go 
project." 
</P>
<P>
Most frustrating to officials is the lack of hard information coming from 
Chevron about its precise plans for the new oil production out of Point 
Arguello. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Chevron has said it plans to pump oil through the All American 
Pipeline from the project's processing plant at Gaviota. Under one plan, oil 
would be transferred at a pumping station at Sisquoc to a Unocal pipeline that 
would carry about 10,000 to 15,000 barrels north each day to a Unocal refinery 
near Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
The other plan would pump the oil along the All American Pipeline to a pumping 
station at Emidio, where it would be transferred to Texaco Inc. pipelines. They 
would move it north to refineries in Kern County or the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
The first plan is the one that has raised questions for officials of Santa 
Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
Oil pumped into the Unocal refinery is turned into semi-refined products, such 
as gas oil and naphtha, that are then moved to other refineries for further 
processing into finished products, such as gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Unocal refinery's production is moved by pipeline north to the Bay 
Area; some of it is piped to Unocal's Avila Beach terminal and shipped out by 
tanker. 
</P>
<P>
John von Reis, energy projects manager for San Luis Obispo County, wonders if 
the increased production from Point Arguello would leave Unocal with no choice 
but to increase tanker traffic. "We don't know what will happen, and we would 
be very interested in the details of that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, he acknowledged, San Luis Obispo County has little authority to 
restrict tanker traffic moving in and out of Avila Beach, one of two county oil 
ports that see about 180 tanker trips a year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the California Coastal Commission, which is considering Chevron's 
appeal of Santa Barbara County's denial of a tanker permit, also want more 
information about the oil firms' plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to know exactly what's happening with (the oil), because they haven't 
said specifically where the oil's going to go or where it's being transported," 
said Susan Hansch, manager of the commission's energy and ocean resources unit. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement this week, Unocal said the Point Arguello crude oil would be 
used solely as feedstock for its Santa Maria refinery and would not be shipped 
out of Avila Beach. Unocal spokesman Jeff Callender also said the Point 
Arguello crude would not mean increased tanker shipments of semi-refined 
products out of Avila Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Santa Barbara County may have the last say on whether Point 
Arguello crude ever gets into Unocal's system: 
</P>
<P>
A 6.5-mile pipe link must still be built between the All American Pipeline and 
Unocal's pipelines -- subject to review and approval by the county.

FOOTNOTES: IF IT WALKS LIKE A DUCK . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As legal battles go, this one is pretty fowl. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge in San Francisco recently ruled that Sharper Image Corp. -- an 
upscale retailer and catalogue operation known for its unusual doo-dads -- did 
not infringe on a patent held by Sunnyvale-based Nobell Inc. when it sold the 
Quacky IV Fone. 
</P>
<P>
The Quacky IV Fone is a telephone that looks like a mallard duck decoy, and it 
quacks and moves its beak instead of ringing. Nobell's feathers were ruffled 
because it holds a patent on a toy that moves or makes sounds or flashes lights 
when a telephone rings. 
</P>
<P>
"The patent covers any personalized telephone signaling device," said Irving M. 
Weiner, Nobell's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge D. Lowell Jensen disagreed, saying that Nobell's device was 
separate from the telephone, while the quacking and beak-moving were an 
integral part of the Quacky IV Fone's operation. Nobell is appealing the 
ruling. Sharper Image no longer sells the Quacky IV Fone. 
</P>
<P>
Still pending is a section of the suit concerning the Fido Phone. Nobell 
contends that San Francisco-based Pacific Orient Trading Co. violated its 
patent by once importing a telephone that -- what else? -- barks. 
</P>
<P>

Sniffing Out Counterfeiters 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Giorgio Beverly Hills has had as much success sleuthing as it 
has selling its renowned perfumes, Giorgio and Red. 
</P>
<P>
The sleuthing is not part of a new detective-services subsidiary at Georgio. It 
is aimed at protecting Giorgio's core business -- fragrances -- from 
counterfeiters. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week the company reported the bust of a major counterfeiting ring in 
London. It said Al Vetter, its director of security, coordinated the 
two-year-long investigation that resulted in the arrest of the gang's four key 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Vetter, who was assisted by Jean Louis Faure, director of security for 
Paris-based clothing and perfume giant YSL, said a total of 27 arrests was 
made. Four fragrance-filling factories, four storage buildings and 20 
residences were raided, and more than 220,000 pieces of perfume-dispensing 
gadgetry were confiscated. The counterfeit items -- Giorgio, Opium, Chanel and 
Obsession -- were targeted for shipment to the United States, Australia, and 
Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
In the past seven months, Giorgio said, it and YSL have played key roles in a 
worldwide crackdown on perfume counterfeiting. In November, they cracked what 
is believed to be the final Singapore link in a global fake-fragrance 
syndicate. In September, they stopped the largest Singapore counterfeiter, 
seizing an estimated $1.8 million worth of bogus perfume. And in June, they 
raided three counterfeit perfume operations in Taiwan and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
Giorgio said the two companies' security departments have also been the 
industry leaders in uncovering bogus scents in California and New York.

Mortgage Rates Decline Again: Fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.56% last week, 
the lowest level in more than three years, according to Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corp. The average, down from 9.81% the week before, was the lowest 
since it fell to 9.43% during the week ending April 10, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
By Oct. 16, however, the average had jumped to 11.58%. On one-year, 
adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders asked an average initial rate of 7.91%, the 
lowest since it hit 7.90% on Aug. 5, 1988. The ARMs average peaked at 9.41% on 
Nov. 11, 1989. The rate was 8.04% last week. The rates do not include add-on 
fees known as points.

CHAIRMAN PREDICTS $4-BILLION FDIC LOSS IN 1990;

Troubled U.S. banks will need about $4 billion in government help this year and 
about $5 billion next year, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William 
Seidman said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two top Administration officials -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. 
Brady and Michael J. Boskin, the White House's chief economic adviser -- 
predicted that any recession would be mild and brief. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman estimated that about 1,000 banks are on the regulatory agency's danger 
list, down from 1,500 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The House Banking Committee opens a hearing on the industry today to review an 
FDIC report that many of the nation's banks are operating "near or on the brink 
of insolvency." 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said on NBC television's "Meet the Press" that the federal government 
is going to be about $1 billion short in meeting the $5 billion that it 
estimates it needs to help ailing banks next year. The industry, not the 
taxpayer, will have to come up with the money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The banks will pay for it," Seidman said, adding that regulators were working 
on ways to raise funds from the institutions to cover government costs of 
financial aid to banks whose loan portfolios have turned sour in a weakened 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The report expected to be made public today at the House Banking Committee 
hearing will predict losses even more glum -- $60 billion the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman brushed the report off, saying, "I don't take seriously" reports that 
project that far into the future. 
</P>
<P>
The federally chartered banks' problems are in addition to those that have 
swept the savings and loan industry, for which the government may have to pay 
as much as $200 billion, largely because of bad real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said regulators plan to crack down on banks that award shareholders 
dividends even though their profits have vanished in a wave of bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should stop it," he said. "I'm for reducing dividends unless they 
are paid out of earnings." 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, appearing on the same program as Seidman, 
agreed that banks are not "as healthy as we would like them." 
</P>
<P>
He said it was time to reform the industry so it can compete better 
internationally and to reflect changes that allow deposits and accounts to 
cross local and regional boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
While avoiding the word recession, Brady acknowledged what government numbers 
have been showing -- that the economy is in a "significant slowdown." 
</P>
<P>
But he said a recession is "no big deal" and this one will be over in less than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
He called on the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a little slow to declare 'national recession day,' " Brady said. 
"But it's quite clear -- there's no point in being unrealistic -- that we're 
going to have a significant economic slowdown in the fourth quarter of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect that that will continue into the first quarter of next year. We don't 
know how much, but we expect that during 1991 it will turn around and we will 
be back on the growth path (of) jobs and investment during that year."

Frequent-Flier Bonuses: Trans World Airlines Inc. sued a former Tustin travel 
agent, George Lemikis of GL Travel, alleging that he defrauded the airline's 
frequent flier bonus program out of millions of dollars over six years and 
amassed 20 million miles in flight credits by having airline tickets issued to 
fictitious passengers. 
</P>
<P>
The suit contends that in some instances "the actual tickets were returned for 
refunds, while the boarding passes were submitted to TWA for the purpose of 
posting mileage" to the phony accounts. The suit seeks an injunction stopping 
Lemikis from carrying on the alleged fraud and damages exceeding $1 million.

HOLIDAY CARDS PUT EXTRA EMPHASIS ON PEACE

With thousands of soldiers encamped in the deserts of the Middle East, peace on 
Earth may be too much to wish for this holiday season, but there's good reason 
to expect peace in your mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
Greeting card industry officials and analysts say holiday cards bearing peace 
wishes will sell briskly this holiday season, reflecting consumer concerns 
about the state of the world and events in the Persian Gulf in particular. 
</P>
<P>
And although the sputtering economy is expected to bring a not-so-merry 
Christmas for the nation's big retailers, sales of greeting cards should buck 
that trend, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"When times are tough, people cut back on buying expensive gifts and buy more 
expensive cards," said analyst Kendrick Noble at Paine Webber Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Greeting Card Assn., an industry group based in Washington, estimates that 
2.3 billion cards will be purchased this holiday season, up from 2.2 billion in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
But for the full year, consumers will spend $4.6 billion on 7.3 billion 
greeting cards, up nearly 10% from $4.2 billion last year, the association 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a pretty tough Christmas," said Kevin Moore at Ohio Co. "But 
on the other hand, greeting cards are a lower-priced kind of purchase and 
generally more of an impulse purchase." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Riviere, a spokeswoman for the trade group, said card sales overall have 
grown steadily for years. They totaled $2.1 billion in 1980, she noted. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas is by far the leading card-sending holiday, said Riviere. Valentine's 
Day and Easter are second and third, respectively, followed by Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to peace theme cards, the environment is another theme likely to 
dominate this season and throughout the 1990s, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a consumer preference for peace-themed items, such as doves, a 
reflection of people's concern over the world situation," said Steve Doyle of 
Hallmark Cards Inc. in Kansas City, Mo., the nation's largest greeting card 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
Riviere said many manufacturers are jumping on the environmental bandwagon by 
planning cards made of recycled paper or linking their products to 
environmentally friendly organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Retailers are being pushed by consumers to have a green ideology in all their 
products," said Jody Roberts, marketing coordinator at Cleveland-based American 
Greetings Inc., the No. 2 manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said American Greetings plans a complete environmental line of boxed 
cards for Christmas, 1991, and will introduce a line linked to the National 
Wildlife Federation before Father's Day next June. 
</P>
<P>
Other growing categories in the industry are cards that reflect changing social 
realities -- "Merry Christmas, Stepfather" is one example -- and cards, 
particularly those with humorous messages, designed to appeal to younger 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The average family sends a total of 44 Christmas cards, according to the group, 
37 of them from boxed sets and seven that are purchased individually. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 companies make greeting cards in the United States. But the three 
largest generate 80% of the sales, the association estimates. Gibson Greetings 
Inc., based in Cincinnati, is third behind Hallmark and American Greetings.

DEALS / ALLAN SLOAN: CBS CHIEF MADE A BIG SACRIFICE FOR OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Remember the famous Sherlock Holmes story, "Silver Blaze," in which the key to 
the mystery was the dog that didn't bark? Well, think of this as the story of 
the $130-million tax break that Laurence A. Tisch didn't take. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch, the tough, shrewd and frugal chairman of Loews Corp., the 
tobacco-television-insurance conglomerate, didn't become a billionaire by 
leaving money on the table. Certainly not amounts like $130 million. Tisch 
giving up a tax break of this size seems to be a violation of the natural order 
-- as if the sun rose in the west or a sucker got an even break. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the CBS stock buyback, announced last week, will someday cost Loews a huge 
tax payment that it could have avoided had CBS paid out $2 billion of dividends 
to its holders rather than buying back $2 billion of stock. Because Tisch is 
CBS' chairman and because Loews is by far CBS' biggest stockholder, you have to 
think that if Tisch made a fuss, CBS would have gone the dividend route. 
</P>
<P>
So why didn't he? No one involved in the deal wanted to discuss this with me. 
The reason, as best I can tell, is that while paying a dividend would have cost 
Loews less in taxes, it would have cost other CBS stockholders more. And that 
Tisch took seriously his obligation to maximize income for CBS holders, toward 
whom he has a fiduciary duty. 
</P>
<P>
CBS is buying 44% of its stock from its holders at $190 a share, an 
above-market price. Because Loews owns about a quarter of CBS' stock, it will 
get about a quarter of the total payout. Let's call it $500 million. For 
reasons complicated beyond belief, tax law allows Loews to treat the $500 
million as a dividend. And any corporation getting dividend income receives a 
huge tax break: 80% of the dividend is excluded from tax. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say that instead of buying back 44% of its shares for $190 each, CBS had 
paid an $83-a-share dividend -- which amounts to the same thing. That would be 
quicker, simpler and cheaper than the buyback plan, which is a logistical mess. 
</P>
<P>
Loews would get about $500 million of dividend income this way too. But because 
CBS is doing a buyback, the tax laws require Loews to reduce the value of its 
remaining CBS stock for tax purposes by $400 million. Had CBS paid a dividend 
instead, Loews could have avoided the $400-million reduction. The reasons for 
this disparity are mind-bogglingly complicated. You don't want to know about 
them. 
</P>
<P>
What all this means is that when Loews sells the CBS shares that it will keep 
after the buyback, it will pay taxes on $400 million of income that it could 
have sheltered. At today's 34% federal corporate tax rate, the tab would be 
$136 million. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that Loews knew about this and could have reaped the 
benefit," says Lehman Bros. tax genius Robert Willens, whom I consulted. And, 
Willens added: "Loews is obviously sacrificing a clear benefit for the common 
good of other CBS stockholders." 
</P>
<P>
Consider, if you will, what would have happened to the estate of the late 
William S. Paley, the longtime CBS chairman. Paley, who died Oct. 26, took 
advantage of the only fail-safe tax loophole: death. Your heirs get to value 
the stock in your estate at what it sells for on the day you die. No income tax 
is due, ever, on the difference between that price and the price you paid for 
the stock. In Paley's case, that's big dough: His 1.3 million shares cost him 
around $5 each but were worth $164 when he died. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that CBS buys 44% of the estate's stock at $190 a share, the estate 
will raise $109 million and will pay a $6-million income tax bill, by my math. 
If CBS had paid an $83-a-share dividend, the estate's tax bill would have been 
$43 million. 
</P>
<P>
Any other tax-paying CBS stockholder would be in the same situation, only with 
fewer dollars at stake. So Tisch is giving up a potential $136 million tax 
saving for Loews to save money for other CBS stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
Contrast this with the special deal that MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman got when 
he sold the company to Matsushita Industrial Electric Co. Other holders get $66 
a share of cash and have to pay a tax bill. Wasserman gets $327 million of 
Matsushita preferred stock in lieu of cash and owes no tax until the preferred 
is sold. Which surely won't be while Wasserman, 78, is among us. The reason, of 
course, is the death loophole. When Wasserman shuffles off this mortal coil, 
his heirs will be able to value the stock at $327 million for tax purposes and 
sell it back to Matsushita. The tax saving: $113 million of federal and 
California income tax, by my math. 
</P>
<P>
MCA said Wasserman wouldn't talk to me. But in an Associated Press story last 
month, he was quoted as saying, "Well, is that against the law?" No, but it 
would have been nice to offer the same deal to other MCA holders who wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
You can argue that I'm being too nice to Tisch, who has dismembered CBS, and 
too nasty to Wasserman, who built MCA. That's a whole other subject. But 
there's no question that, when it came to treating his shareholders fairly, 
Tisch bent over backward. And that Wasserman should have too.

SELL NOW? NO EASY ANSWER FOR CBS' HOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, CBS Inc. Chairman Laurence A. Tisch made a deal that he thinks CBS 
shareholders can't refuse: The company will spend $2 billion to buy back 44% of 
its stock for $190 per share. 
</P>
<P>
For anybody who bought CBS stock since last July, when it began to slide to 
$150 a share from $180, the tender offer represents a tidy profit. (Following 
Wednesday's buyback announcement, CBS stock has rebounded slightly, closing 
Friday at $173 a share.) 
</P>
<P>
But some investors may wonder if CBS shares will go higher and if they should 
hold out for a bigger payday. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the answer is not straightforward. Wall Street analysts have 
different opinions. For some, it comes down to a gut feeling that Tisch can be 
taken at his word, that he won't sell the network and that the shares will 
decline in price after the buyback. Others think that the buyback sets the 
stage for the network to be sold -- and for a price well above $190 a share. 
</P>
<P>
CBS said it would buy back 10.5 million of its 23.7 million outstanding shares. 
The Tisch family controls 5.8 million shares, or 24.8% of the stock, and the 
estate of company founder William S. Paley controls 1.3 million, or 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Both will tender all their shares, so if the offer is fully subscribed -- and 
CBS and its investment banker, Salomon Bros., expect it to be -- their relative 
stakes will not significantly change. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street has joked that owning CBS stock is like investing in a money-market 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the company has earned as much from its $3 billion in cash 
reserves as it has from operations, which include a TV network, five TV 
stations, 20 radio stations, two radio networks, a 50% stake in a home video 
company and 50% of a production facility in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the "fundamentals" of CBS are not particularly good. Weighted 
down by $3.6 billion in TV sports commitments, the network is spilling red ink 
because advertising and ratings did not meet projections. The network will take 
a $170-million after-tax loss in the fourth quarter from its baseball deal 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts believe that the price of CBS stock after the tender offer will 
fall below $165 per share. How far down depends on the analyst, but a few even 
venture to say it might trade under $120. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, analysts explain, is that the company will no longer enjoy the 
interest income from its $3-billion cash hoard, which earned CBS $180.7 million 
last year (after interest on debt) and $129.2 million through the first nine 
months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Tisch, sending a strong message that he won't expand CBS beyond its core 
broadcasting business, will instead use the company's cash hoard to repurchase 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
After the buyback, CBS says, it will have $800 million in cash left, which is 
almost exactly equal to its debt load. Next year, earnings will be solely 
dependent upon operations, and one major profit center -- the network -- is 
already projected to lose money in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Appert, a vice president at the C. J. Lawrence investment firm in New 
York, recommends that shareholders sell. 
</P>
<P>
He reasons that the price of CBS stock will fall to about $145 after the tender 
"because they won't have the interest income any longer." The near-term outlook 
for network earnings is "lousy," he said, and Wall Street is now focusing on 
how CBS will do in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
For the longer term, however, Appert suggests that changes in federal 
regulations -- the so-called financial interest and syndication rules -- 
allowing the networks to sell lucrative TV show reruns, along with the 
elimination of most of the cash on the balance sheet, signals a "reasonably 
good possibility (CBS) could be sold." 
</P>
<P>
Appert calculates that CBS' assets, if the company were sold, are worth $250 to 
$300 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Saler, assistant vice president at Lexington Management, a money 
management firm in Saddle Brook, N.J., admits to being "one of the bulls in 
this case." He believes that "people will wrongly look at this company from an 
earnings standpoint in the next year." 
</P>
<P>
Saler is among observers who think that the relaxation of the fin/syn rules 
will open the door for a Hollywood studio to buy CBS -- particularly Walt 
Disney or Paramount Communications. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at what the franchise value of the network can kick out in a 
normal year, along with changes in fin/syn. Then earnings can be substantially 
higher," he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard MacDonald, a partner in the New York investment firm MacDonald 
Grippo Riely, is telling shareholders to unload the stock. 
</P>
<P>
"We are recommending to our clients that they sell their shares now because the 
combined value of the tender offer and the stub left over afterwards will be 
lower than the current price of the stock," he warns. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald's advice is based on his calculation that the stock could go so far 
down after the tender offer that shareholders will not be able to get a decent 
price for what they have left, and the premium price of $190 that Tisch is 
offering does not make up for the difference. 
</P>
<P>
The main culprit, he says, are the sports deals, which will cause the network 
to lose perhaps $125 million next year. "They've got very deep problems there," 
he says.

MARKET BEAT: INSIDERS HIT FLASH POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Corporate insiders are rapidly changing their minds about the value in their 
own stocks. That could be bad news for the struggling market rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Insiders newsletter of Ft. Lauderdale tracks the number of insiders buying 
and selling their own companies' shares. The insiders must publicly disclose 
their transactions in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
As the stock market sank in October and early November, insiders were wildly 
snapping up their own shares -- a clear sign that they felt that the stocks 
were dramatically undervalued. The Insiders newsletter's "Flash index," which 
measures insider transactions over the most recent 30 days, counted nine buyers 
for every one seller in October. That 90% reading was an all-time high -- and 
it coincided with the start of the market's recent rally, which has lifted the 
Dow Jones industrial index to 2,593.81 as of Friday, from 2,365 in October. 
</P>
<P>
But in the past few weeks, insider buying has been on the wane. The Flash index 
tumbled to 75% buyers by Dec. 4. And as of Dec. 12, the latest available, the 
index was 60%, says Norman Fosback, editor of the Insiders. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, a shorter-term Flash index, measuring trades over the past 20 days, fell 
to 52% last week, Fosback says. That still means 52% buyers to 48% sellers, but 
it's obvious that stock prices aren't nearly as interesting to insiders as they 
were at October's lows. 
</P>
<P>
Does the slide in insider buying mean that the rally is over? Fosback doesn't 
think so. "If the index were a lot lower, I'd be concerned," he says. Still, 
the rate of drop in the buying in recent weeks is very steep and bears 
watching, he admits. 
</P>
<P>
Teradata's Rising Star: Teradata Corp., the Los Angeles-based computer firm, is 
in the middle of the hostile takeover battle between American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co. and NCR Corp. From Teradata shareholders' viewpoint, the middle 
isn't such a bad place to be. 
</P>
<P>
NCR owns 9.4% of Teradata and has been working closely with the company on new 
technology. The two firms have side-by-side operations in San Diego as part of 
a joint development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T wants NCR for the company's computer technology. Because Teradata's 
expertise is key to NCR's technology, AT&amp;T in essence needs Teradata almost 
as much as it needs NCR. What's more, AT&amp;T is already Teradata's largest 
customer. 
</P>
<P>
What this tangled web means, basically, is that Teradata probably has much 
greater value than the stock market currently is assigning it -- but maybe not 
in the short term. The stock closed at $12 Friday, up 75 cents for the day. It 
has rebounded from a low of $6.75 in November but remains far below its 1990 
high of $35.50. 
</P>
<P>
Teradata's computers are very high-priced systems known as relational database 
computers, which allow users such as AT&amp;T to keep track of trillions of 
data bits. After Iraq invaded Kuwait, and recession fears mounted in September, 
orders dried up as many corporate customers delayed capital spending decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Teradata reported a loss of 50 cents a share in the quarter ended 
Sept. 30. A turnaround in profits may not arrive until mid-1991, because 
customers are likely to remain cautious about spending. Rick Martin, analyst at 
Prudential-Bache Securities, sees earnings of just 25 cents a share for the 
year that will end next June 30. The company earned $1.25 a share last year. 
</P>
<P>
Some traders who have jumped into Teradata stock recently are betting that 
either 1) NCR will bid for all of Teradata, as a way to make itself too 
expensive for AT&amp;T, or 2) AT&amp;T will win NCR and eventually swallow 
Teradata as well. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, NCR rejected AT&amp;T's $6.1-billion offer. But some analysts say it 
would make little sense for NCR now to buy all of Teradata to try to halt 
AT&amp;T. Even if NCR were to bid $35.50 a share for Teradata -- the stock's 
all-time high -- the price would come to just $540 million. It's hard to 
imagine that such a merger would decrease NCR's attractiveness, when AT&amp;T 
itself spends millions of dollars on Teradata systems. 
</P>
<P>
"For both of these companies (AT&amp;T and NCR), Teradata is very strategic," 
says Jim Reynolds, analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As for a potential purchase of Teradata by AT&amp;T down the road, analysts 
caution that AT&amp;T wouldn't need to buy the entire firm to reap the benefits 
of the technology. And, in fact, folding Teradata into AT&amp;T might ruin 
Teradata's entrepreneurial spirit. 
</P>
<P>
So it's clear that any bet on the stock now should only be for the long term. 
The firm's sales success -- from $17 million in 1986 to $224 million in the 
recent fiscal year -- shows that its systems have enormous acceptance. The 
interest in Teradata by NCR and AT&amp;T merely confirms the potential in the 
technology. So beyond the current economic slump, there's good reason to assume 
that the firm's sales will rebound. But until the orders begin to flow again, 
the stock could languish -- and a takeover seems remote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE SELLERS REIGN 
</P>
<P>
Among NYSE stocks, insiders have sold these heaviest over the past year. Some 
issues show heavy selling because insiders got generous stock options.

A 27-year-old man died today after being struck in the back by a single gunshot 
Sunday night while trying to flee an altercation in a downtown alley, Anaheim 
police said.

<P>
Robert Rosado, whose address was unknown by authorities, was pronounced dead at 
5:17 a.m. today at UCI Medical Center in Orange.

<P>
Police said witnesses reported seeing three men fighting about 7 p.m. Sunday in 
an alley in the 500 block of East Wilhelmina Street. The witnesses said one of 
the men, who was later identified by police as Rosado, attempted to run from 
the fight. As he did, one of the two suspects pulled a handgun and fired once, 
hitting Rosado in the back.

The men then fled on foot. Police say they do not know what set off the 
altercation and have made no arrests in the case.

A powerful earthquake rumbled in southwestern Iran, triggering landslides that 
sealed off several mountain villages and injuring at least 44 people, Tehran 
radio reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The temblor hit the Persian Gulf port of Bushehr about 460 miles south of 
Tehran and was epicentered in the Zagros Mountains northeast of the waterfront 
city. 
</P>
<P>
A Tehran radio dispatch monitored in Athens said at least 44 people were hurt 
in the tremor, which had a magnitude of 6.5. 
</P>
<P>
Access to five villages was cut off when mountain roads were blocked by 
landslides touched off by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes with a magnitude between 6 and 7 are normally killers in highly 
populated areas in Iran. But the population in the southern Zagros during the 
cold season is low, and officials said that may account for the relatively 
small number of casualties.

A survey indicates Roman Catholic priests are becoming more willing to accept 
the ordination of women. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine U.S. Catholic sent 1,300 readers an article by Gregory F. 
Augustine Pierce, a syndicated columnist and Catholic author, in which he 
advocated the ordination of women. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine asked readers to comment on the article. 
</P>
<P>
The results were published in the magazine's January issue, released today. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-nine percent of the respondents were laywomen, 23% laymen and 8% clergy. 
Of the three groups, the biggest increase in support came from priests. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine percent of the priests said women should be ordained. That compared 
to 48% in a 1975 survey. 
</P>
<P>
More than three-fourths of the laypeople said they would welcome a female 
priest to their parishes. Women are more likely to attend a Mass celebrated by 
a female priest, but 78% of the men said they would have no objections to a 
female priest.

Brazil's daredevil president, Fernando Collor de Mello, had a slight car 
accident here Sunday, Brazilian newspapers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
O Globo, a pro-Collor newspaper in Rio de Janeiro, published a photo on its 
front page of a white Kombi that collided with a car driven by the president. 
</P>
<P>
It quoted the Kombi's driver, Geraldo Reis, as blaming Collor for the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers said the president turned to the right without warning and the Kombi 
following behind him crashed into the back of his car. The reports said Collor 
did not stop after the accident, which slightly injured two people in the 
Kombi. 
</P>
<P>
Collor has gained his daredevil reputation by piloting a jet, riding a 
motorcycle and diving in a submarine among other exploits since he took over 
the presidency in March.

EX-EAST GERMAN CHIEF RESIGNS AMID CLAIMS OF STASI TIES

Former East German Premier Lothar de Maiziere resigned today as minister 
without portfolio in the German federal government after claims that he had 
been an informer for East Germany's communist state security police. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere said he will also give up his positions as vice chairman of 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union and leader of 
the CDU in the eastern state of Brandenburg. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing his resignation at a news conference, he again rejected the 
contentions he had acted for the police agency -- known as Stasi -- under the 
code name "Czerny." 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, East Germany's last prime minister, made the announcement after 
meeting today with Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and Joachim Gauck, the 
government official in charge of evaluating Stasi documents. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement read by Schaeuble, Kohl said: "Lothar de Maiziere has earned my 
complete trust and I have no reason to doubt him." 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere, who worked as an attorney before heading the East German 
government, said he does not know whether the once-powerful Stasi kept a file 
on him. 
</P>
<P>
"My contact with the Stasi was limited to attempts to help clients. I accepted 
no money and signed no statement committing myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I will resign from my post as minister for special assignments, and will not 
be available for a Cabinet post in the new government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl is to form a new government early next year, after the victory of his 
center-right coalition in Dec. 2 all-German elections. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence in the files which could connect de Maiziere to Czerny is not 
clear enough," Schaeuble said. 
</P>
<P>
German media recently published statements by a former Stasi major, Edgar 
Hasse, who alleged that since 1982, de Maiziere had reported to the agency 
about church activities in East Germany and about his contacts with West German 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Stasi was disbanded after the collapse of East Germany's communist 
government in fall, 1989. Documents released recently showed that 85,000 people 
worked as full-time employees of the organization and as many as 300,000 people 
acted as informers -- about one in 30 East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
De Maiziere led the conservative CDU to victory in East Germany's first free 
elections March 18, and became the first non-communist leader in the country's 
40-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Upon the Oct. 3 unification of Germany, he joined Kohl's Cabinet as a minister 
without portfolio, or specific assignment.

<P>
Tens of thousands of students and workers staged strikes today to press demands 
for the government to resign, but Prime Minister Petre Roman vowed not to quit. 
</P>
<P>
However, Roman and President Ion Iliescu held talks with Radu Campeanu, leader 
of one of the two main parliamentary opposition parties, amid indications that 
the opposition party might join the government. 
</P>
<P>
The current Cabinet is made up solely of members of the National Salvation 
Front, which overwhelmingly won May's elections. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious disruption from today's strikes was a work stoppage at the 
national airline Tarom. Domestic flights were grounded, and international 
flights were delayed. Management announced that in view of a strike by 
navigators and other workers, all flights will be grounded Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Campeanu, leader of the National Liberal Party, demanded last week that 
opposition parties be allowed to join the government to broaden support for 
needed economic reforms and to improve democracy. He also demanded that Roman 
be replaced by someone unaffiliated with the Front. 
</P>
<P>
But Roman, speaking on national television late Sunday, firmly rejected calls 
for his resignation and stressed that he had sided with all those who rebelled 
against the communist government. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Campeanu, Roman said the Front was "open" to a "sharing of 
responsibility in a difficult moment" for Romania.

California billionaire Kirk Kerkorian disclosed today he has no immediate plans

</P>
<P>
In a filing today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Kerkorian said 
the purchase "is solely for the purpose of investment." 
</P>
<P>
He said he will consider general economic, money and stock market conditions in 
determining whether to buy more Chrysler shares. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler disclosed on Friday that Kerkorian had purchased about 9.8% of its 
stock, making him the company's largest stockholder. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian said today in a report filed with the SEC that his stake in Chrysler 
as of last Friday was 22 million shares, or 9.77% 
</P>
<P>
The stock was purchased, mostly on the open market between Oct. 11 and Nov. 16, 
at prices ranging from $10.50 to $11.25. Large, privately negotiated 
transactions for cash in Chrysler stock were made on Nov. 19, Dec. 10 and Dec. 
12 at prices ranging from $11.25 to $13.30 per share, the filing said.

The total price was $272 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian said he and his Beverly Hills-based Tracinda Corp. "have no present 
intention to purchase any additional shares" of Chrysler common stock. He said 
he had no plans to press for "an extraordinary corporate transaction" such as a 
merger, reorganization or liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC filing is required of anyone who purchases more than 5% of a company's 
outstanding common stock. 
</P>
<P>
Buying into struggling Chrysler Corp. during an auto industry recession may 
seem, on its face, like an unwise move. But some analysts believe that 
Kerkorian may turn a tidy, quick profit. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people assume this is nothing more than someone who views the stock as 
undervalued," said Michigan state Treasurer Robert Bowman. The state controls 
about 6.5 million shares, or about 3%, of Chrysler's outstanding stock. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York said the investment 
makes sense. "Barring a nuclear war in the Middle East, he gets his money 
back," said Brady, who is bullish on the Big Three. 
</P>
<P>
But William Steele of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco doubts that 
Kerkorian is a passive investor. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that a passive investor is somebody who's after dividends and 
price appreciation," he said. "His past history doesn't show that he is a 
passive person." 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian made the Chrysler purchase less than two months after his sale of 
MGM-UA Communications Co. for $1.3 billion became final. He received an 
estimated $950 million to $1 billion.

GATT Director General Arthur Dunkel has called a meeting of Uruguay Round trade 
negotiators for Jan. 15, his spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
The four-year round to liberalize global commerce, which was to have been 
concluded earlier this month at a ministerial meeting in Brussels, was instead 
suspended to allow more time for differences to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no indication yet that positions had moved sufficiently, 
especially on the key area of farm subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
David Woods, spokesman for the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, said the ambassador-level meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee 
would attempt to get the Uruguay Round moving again. 
</P>
<P>
The TNC is the coordinating committee and is made up of all 107 nations taking 
part in the Round, which has been negotiated under the auspices of GATT. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 3-7 ministerial meeting in Brussels tried but failed to wrap up the 
talks.

Stock prices were mostly lower in quiet year-end trading today, pressured by 
Middle East worries. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 0.49 points to 2,593.32. 
</P>

SINKING SABRES DEAL FOLIGNO TO MAPLE LEAFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The struggling Buffalo Sabres traded their captain, forward Mike Foligno, to 
the Toronto Maple Leafs today for two veteran players, Lou Franceschetti and 
Brian Curran. 
</P>
<P>
Trade rumors had surrounded Foligno, 31, for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
He played in all but one of the Sabres' 32 games so far this season, but seldom 
started and scored just four goals with five assists as the Sabres got off to a 
disappointing 10-15-7 start. 
</P>
<P>
Foligno, who was acquired from Detroit in 1981, has played in 663 games during 
his career at Buffalo, scoring 247 goals and 263 assists for 510 points. 
</P>
<P>
He holds Buffalo's all-time record for penalty minutes, with 1,450, including 
42 this season, and ranks in the team's all-time top 10 in most other major 
categories. He had been the Sabres' captain since Feb. 15, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Franceschetti, 32, a right wing, has appeared in only 16 games after sitting 
out part of the season with a broken foot. He has scored one goal and one 
assist this season. 
</P>
<P>
Curran, 27, has not played since being recalled on Dec. 13 from the Leafs' farm 
team at Newmarket, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
All players are expected to report to their new teams by Tuesday, when the 
Leafs will visit the New York Islanders and Buffalo will play at Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
Boston defenseman Ray Bourque, who had seven points in three games, was named 
NHL Player of the Week. 
</P>
<P>
Bourque had a goal and six assists in two victories over Hartford and a 1-1 tie 
with the New Jersey Devils, giving him 28 points in 29 games this season.

UCLA MOVES UP TO NO. 5 IN BASKETBALL POLL; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGES: COACH HARRICK CREDITS TEAMWORK FOR THE BRUINS' 7-0 START. UNLV 
REMAINS NO. 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Harrick promised stability when he became the sixth man to follow John 
Wooden as UCLA's basketball coach. What he is delivering is success. 
</P>
<P>
At 7-0, the Bruins are off to their best start since Wooden quit winning 
national championships in 1975, and they're among the elite with a No. 5 
ranking in this week's Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, I think we were 45th," Harrick said today. "That's probably the 
best part of it, where we were and where we've come to." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins haven't been ranked this high since the next-to-last poll of the 
1982-83 season. 
</P>
<P>
The top four teams -- UNLV, Arkansas, Syracuse and Arizona -- are unchanged 
from last week. Georgetown fell from No. 5 to No. 12 after losing to Texas-El 
Paso, 71-60, on Saturday, clearing the way for UCLA to move up from No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's early in the season," Harrick said, "but I'd rather be there than 
not." 
</P>
<P>
In his third season since replacing the fired Walt Hazzard, Harrick has 
compiled a 50-21 record. That's one more loss than Wooden had in his last 10 
seasons combined, but it's progress nevertheless for a school that lost 14 
games two of the three previous seasons before Harrick arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"What got us to the top five is playing together, sharing the ball and making 
the extra pass," Harrick said. "We have better defenders, more depth and we're 
sharing the ball. Those are the key things." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV (3-0), a 95-75 winner over Michigan State, polled 61 of 63 first-place 
votes and 1,573 ranking points. Syracuse, which beat Cal State Long Beach, 
94-79, and UCLA, which beat DePaul, 92-90, got the other two first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
Five UCLA players average in double figures, and three of them -- Don MacLean, 
Shon Tarver and Keith Owens -- are making 60% or better of their field-goal 
attempts. Tarver, a freshman, and Owens are reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seven starters," Harrick said, stressing the importance of Tarver and 
Owens. "We have goals of 20 to 25 assists and 52 to 55% (field-goal shooting). 
We've reached those goals most of the time this year. We have some very good 
shooters on this team." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick pointed to Owens and Tarver as keys to UCLA's success. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just been a catalyst," Harrick said of Owens, who has blocked 22 shots in 
UCLA's seven games. "I expected him to help us and contribute and it's been 
much, much more than that. 
</P>

MELVIN DURSLAG: AL DAVIS PLAYS SHELL GAME -- RAIDERS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Advancing to a place they used to know -- the NFL playoffs -- the Los Angeles 
Raiders exhale deeply today, their faith reaffirmed in their artistry. 
</P>
<P>
Up until 1985, it was an unconventional turn of events if the Raiders didn't 
advance to the playoffs. The only question was how far in the playoffs they 
would advance. 
</P>
<P>
It was like the old days in Texas when all the big shooters drove Cadillacs. If 
a man said he bought a new car, you never asked him what kind. 
</P>
<P>
All you asked was, "What color?" 
</P>
<P>
But when the Raiders fell out of rhythm and began to miss tournaments, the 
confidence of their curator, Al Davis, was shaken visibly. 
</P>
<P>
Coming to feel the problem may have been the fault of his coach at the time, 
Tom Flores, Al encouraged Tom's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Any time an owner is undecided whether the coach or the owner is at fault, the 
coach usually gains the nod. 
</P>
<P>
So now Al sits down and asks himself what ails the Raiders. Was his science 
dated? Was a young coach, with fresh concepts, the answer? 
</P>
<P>
This is how Davis comes to hire Mike Shanahan, offensive specialist for Denver, 
a modern, fast-moving team. Whatever questions Davis asked during the 
interview, Shanahan supplied the right answers. 
</P>
<P>
What he failed to supply were the right answers on the field, almost leading to 
Raider ruination. The team was losing. Attendance was falling. And, worst of 
all, the Raiders had become the object of ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
That meant bon voyage for Mr. Shanahan and, desperate for a fast replacement, 
Davis hands the ball to his old blocking lineman, Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
Shell never had served as a head coach. In the NFL, no black man ever had. What 
appealed to Davis most about Shell was that Art was around when the Raiders 
used to win, and maybe he remembered how they did it. 
</P>
<P>
It was that easy. In his first full season on the job, he takes the Raiders to 
the playoffs, making a hero of Art, a genius of Al and engendering new hope for 
those who follow the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Little things sometimes decide big issues. At the start of training camp, for 
instance, the Raiders faced the dilemma of playing at quarterback Jay Schroeder 
or Steve Beuerlein, holdovers from the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
Beuerlein simplified the decision. He didn't show up, contending that the 
Raiders were offering him less money than one of his station should be paid. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder goes to work and, at the last audit, he starts 14 games this season 
and wins 10. 
</P>
<P>
What would have happened if Beuerlein entered the argument isn't known. But, 
failing to appear at camp, he created convenience for Shell, not to mention 
Schroeder, and the Raiders have cashed a winning ticket here. 
</P>
<P>
It is none too soon, considering the club sold but 22,700 season seats this 
year, well below the figures of rivals in their division. 
</P>
<P>
Short of season sales, the Raiders have been made to depend on weekly sales, 
explaining the relatively moderate crowds this year for a team winning 10 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Interjecting this tawdry commercial note, let us pursue the matter further. If 
the economy continues to falter, teams next year depending upon weekly sales 
will be hurt the most. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime season-ticket buyers, such as those at Denver, Seattle and San 
Francisco, aren't likely to give up their locations. They will tough it out. 
</P>
<P>
But the Raiders and their 22,700? The club must boost its season following next 
year or it will suffer as it has this year. 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, the Raiders on Sunday were shooting for a playoff spot. They were 
playing Cincinnati, an exciting opponent. They drew only 54,000. 
</P>
<P>
But money is one thing and performance another. The Raiders aren't getting 
rich, but offer thanks, at least, they no longer are getting ridiculed.

BROWNS PROVIDE LESSONS IN LOYALTY; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: TEACHERS SAY STUDENTS PROFIT FROM THE EXAMPLE OF THE CLEVELAND TEAM 
AS IT ENDS ITS LOSING STREAK.

The beleaguered Cleveland Browns are providing the inspiration for young 
students at a Summit County school where lessons in loyalty are being taught. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers at Cathedral Christian School say it is important to show children 
that sometimes loyalty means sticking around during a losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
And what better example to stand beside than the Browns, who improved to 3-11 
and ended an eight-game skid with Sunday's 13-10 win over Atlanta? 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of a series of teachings about being faithful and fickle," said 
Melanie Kemp, administrator of the nondenominational school. "Being faithful as 
a fan is one of the little things of life. But being faithful as a fan teaches 
you how you can be faithful in relationships, faithful in keeping your word and 
faithful in carrying out your responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Pupils at Cathedral, pre-kindergarten through the seventh grade, have been 
sporting Browns duds -- hats, T-shirts and fake dog ears -- even through the 
team's lopsided losses. 
</P>
<P>
About 115 of them barked and cheered their way through a pep rally for the 
Browns on Friday. The barking was higher-pitched than the woofs emanating from 
the Cleveland Stadium's rowdy "Dawg Pound" bleacher section, but the little 
fans' fervor was there. 
</P>
<P>
"Our philosophy here is that a kid remembers 10% of what he hears, 50% of what 
he sees and 80% of what he does," said Kemp, who also teaches history. "We 
think it's very important to involve the kids and let them learn." 
</P>
<P>
Browns prizes were awarded to pupils for creating the best posters. Caps, 
sweatbands and field towels were handed out, and one student got a pair of 
tickets for Sunday's game.

STARS DONE IN BY KIDS' PLAY AT BOX OFFICE; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: "HOME ALONE," "LOOK WHO'S TALKING TOO" STEAL THE THUNDER AS REDFORD AND 
CHER RETURN TO THE SCREEN WITH DISAPPOINTING DRAWS.

Kid stars dramatically upstaged superstars Robert Redford and Cher at the 
weekend box office, as a trio of youth-oriented titles -- led by the runaway 
hit, "Home Alone" -- topped the charts with combined ticket sales of more than 
$26 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Mermaids" -- the first film from Cher since her Academy Award-winning 
performance in "Moonstruck" in 1987 -- had opening weekend ticket sales of 
about $3.5 million on 918 screens, for a weak per-screen average of $3,812 and 
seventh place. 
</P>
<P>
"Havana," which marks the seventh teaming of Redford and director Sydney 
Pollack -- following the 1985 Oscar winner, "Out of Africa" -- had opening 
weekend receipts of about $2.2 million on 826 screens for a disappointing 
per-screen average of $2,663 and ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, first place again went to 20th Century-Fox's family comedy "Home 
Alone." Starring Macaulay Culkin as a plucky 8-year-old who must defend the 
homestead when he's left home alone for the holidays, the film earned about 
$11.9 million on 2,017 screens for a per-screen average of $5,899. After five 
weeks' release, it is poised to surpass the $100-million mark. 
</P>
<P>
In second place, with receipts of about $8 million, was Tri-Star Pictures' 
sequel to last year's fall sleeper, "Look Who's Talking Too." About a trio of 
wise-cracking toddlers -- who "speak" via voice-overs by Bruce Willis, Roseanne 
Barr and Damon Wayans -- the film opened at 1,576 theaters, where it averaged 
$5,899 per screen. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's comedy-drama "Edward Scissorhands" -- directed by Tim Burton 
("Beetlejuice," "Batman") and starring Johnny Depp as an extraordinary young 
man with scissors for hands -- was third with ticket sales of about $6.2 
million. In its first week of wide release on 1,023 screens, the film had a 
per-screen average of $6,060. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere among the weekend's top 10: 
</P>
<P>
"Dances With Wolves" (Orion Pictures) was fourth with $4.5 million; "Misery" 
(Columbia Pictures), fifth, $4.1 million; "The Rookie" (Warner Bros.), sixth, 
$3.5 million; "Three Men and a Little Lady" (Buena Vista), eighth, $2.7 
million; "Predator II" (Fox), 10th, $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood's seasonal offerings continue this week, with the opening of 10 
additional titles, led by the Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy, "Kindergarten Cop" 
(opening Friday) and the Sean Connery-Michelle Pfeiffer romantic thriller "The 
Russia House" (opening Wednesday).

Actress Kathy Baker says critics have been using the "f" word to describe her 
performance in the new movie "Edward Scissorhands," and she couldn't be 
happier. 
</P>
<P>
"That's 'f' for funny," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first screen comedy. Until now there was this attitude in Hollywood 
that Kathy Baker can't do comedy." 
</P>
<P>
In "Scissorhands," Johnny Depp plays a creature built by Vincent Price who has 
blades instead of fingers. Baker's predatory suburban housewife fails to seduce 
him, then claims he attacked her. 
</P>
<P>
Before "Scissorhands," moviegoers saw her in such darker films as "Jacknife" 
with Robert De Niro, "Clean and Sober" with Michael Keaton and "Dad" with Ted 
Danson and Jack Lemmon. The National Society of Film Critics named her best 
supporting actress in 1987 for her role as a prostitute in "Street Smart." 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband and two children have taken an apartment in Kansas City 
while she makes the movie "Article 99" about a staff rebellion at a Veterans 
Administration hospital.

Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne and Kris Kristofferson held a concert with Indian 
performers aimed at bringing Indians and whites closer together. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's Concert for Reconciliation stemmed from Gov. George Mickelson's 
declaration of 1990 as Year of Reconciliation between whites and Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Between 150 and 400 Indian men, women and children were killed Dec. 29, 1890, 
by cavalry gunfire at Wounded Knee. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to raise funds and consciousness for the Lakota people," said 
Raitt, a Grammy-winning blues singer and guitarist. She referred to the name by 
which the Sioux Indians call themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Money will be donated to several causes, including Oglala Lakota College and a 
group of Indians riding horses across the state to Wounded Knee to commemorate 
the massacre.

SALES AND USE TAX REVENUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County cities' sales and use tax revenues dropped for the second 
consecutive month in October, the most recent month for which information is 
available. The October total, $20.1 million, was almost 20% less than the 
September amount, which itself was lower than in August. October's was the 
fourth lowest total during the 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
The amount was almost 12% higher than last October, however, and virtually all 
cities registered gains over October 1989. In fact, Dana Point and Villa Park 
both received at least 66% more than last year. The only exception was La 
Palma, which got about the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
This October Anaheim received the most money, about $2.8 million, but it's per 
capita amount, $10.44, was a little more than half Costa Mesa's $19.09 -- the 
highest per capita amount of any city. 
</P>
<P>
Each month city and county governments and other governmental organizations 
receive payments from the state in anticipation of actual sales tax revenues. 
In the fourth month, they receive a cleanup payment -- the difference between 
actual revenues and the amounts previously received -- plus the first advance 
payment for the next quarter. The amounts listed here are the second advance 
payment for the third quarter of 1990.

COUNTY ISSUE: LOCATING A NEW JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors voted recently to begin proceedings to seize property 
for a new jail. The site is on Todd Road near Santa Paula. Some people worry 
that the complex would be too near the Freeman Water Diversion Project and 
could pollute the Santa Clara River. Should Ventura County build a new jail on 
that site? 
</P>
<P>
* John V. Gillespie, Ventura County sheriff 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely. There is very minimal chance of problems environmentally or 
aesthetically in that area, and it will be a substantial boon to the area and 
help us maintain our low crime rate. We have now reached 1,100 inmates in a 
jail originally designed for 430. The overcrowding is severe. We have had the 
lowest crime rate in the Western United States, west of the Ohio River, for 
eight straight years. In order to maintain a nationally low crime rate, even 
though we're bordering Los Angeles, we must have someplace to put the culprits. 
I'm very concerned about the environment, but my environment -- the environment 
I'm speaking of anyway has to do with people feeling safe on the streets and in 
their homes from violence, gangs, drugs and other urban blight -- that 
certainly needs to be considered as much as any other part of the environment. 
I want to see trees grow, but I also want to see young children grow. YOu can 
cut trees down, and you can also cut young children down by feeding them 
cocaine. We need the new

We do not believe that a project at that location causes any concern with 
respect to pollution associated with the Freeman diversion project. That issue 
has been raised by some opponents of the project who are searching for an 
issue. They've talked about two things. One is if we have a sewage treatment 
plant on the site, discharge, if upstream, could contaminate the Oxnard 
aquifer. We've told the United Water Conservation District that we're willing 
to discharge anywhere they'd like. That is if we discharge at all, which we may 
not, because our plan is to attempt to reclaim all of the treated sewage for 
irrigation of the agriculture we plan to maintain at the site. The second issue 
is the potential discharge of pollutants from the site, such as motor fuel, 
lead, asbestos, any number of things. We plan to install facilities to capture 
the first flush after a rain and to separate those pollutants. When we find out 
if any of these problems are real, we will work to change them. We've worked 
too long to take any action which would detrimentally affect their efforts at 
recharging the ground-water basin. 
</P>
<P>
* Fred J. Glentke, General manager, United Water Conservation District 
</P>
<P>
We have two principal issues here. One is that an increase in liability to 
United could result from flood damage to any county facilities at the 
construction site. We've made all our prior decisions based on the fact that 
the land would be used as a lemon orchard and not as a facility for several 
thousand inmates and jail personnel. The liability to a facility and these 
people is much broader and deeper. United needs to have a release of liability. 
The second area of concern is the environment. We are aware that the site 
previously had oil-producing facilities on it and adjacent to it an oil sump. 
We're also aware of the nearby earthquake fault, the Oak Ridge. We have asked 
the county to first prepare a site-specific environmental impact report so any 
environmental concerns may be addressed. We have not found any ground-water 
pollution problems in that area, but that's our preliminary finding. You see 
right now considerable amounts of contaminated soil have been stockpiled at the 
site for disposal. We would prefer a site-specific environmental impact report 
be finished before the property is purchased. 
</P>
<P>
* Robert C. Pinkerton, Farmer

<P>
No. Building the jail there is breaking the greenbelt, and that is precisely 
why I'm against it. We recently sent a certified letter to Supervisor Erickson 
asking 10 specific questions about he project. We're wanting specific, 
meaningful answers. In keeping the greenbelt, we prevent the Santa Clara River 
Valley from becoming another Irvine Ranch or another San Fernando Valley. a 
federal policy says you don't jump into unincorporated land far out from a 
municipal center of influence. In other words, don't jump into the middle of ag 
land. You invite industry into an agricultural area, and industry and 
agriculture are not really compatible. There are problems with trespassing, 
vehicular flow . . . and irrigation. And the heavy traffic creates dust, which 
is a detriment to our crops. This is very serious and causes brown mite 
infestation. In order to keep that down, we have to do more spraying and we 
don't like to do anything unnecessary to the produce we raise. I'm not opposed 
to the need for a jail, I'm just opposed to the present location, which is in 
the middle of the greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
* Maggie H. Erickson, Supervisor, Ventura County 
</P>
<P>
Yes. Ventura County is facing serious overcrowding problems in our jail. We are 
involved in many diversion programs, such as work release and furlough, but it 
is not enough to relieve the overcrowding in the main jail. So the decision has 
been made to build a new jail. The Todd Road site between Ventura and Santa 
Paula was selected after many, many months of study, including looking at 
environmental issues. The cost of building at the government center was 
prohibitive. Now we are in the process of having a site-specific environmental 
impact report done. One of the issues to be addressed is the protection of the 
Freeman diversion project from any possible pollution. Other issues to be 
addressed include the access road, the possible flooding, the earthquake 
hazards and myriad issues that are included in environmental impact reports. 
The board wants to be very certain that every possible hazard has been 
identified and addressed so that there is no danger to people or to the 
environment.
