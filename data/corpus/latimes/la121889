POLITICIANS ASKED FOR THE PADDLING THEY'LL GET; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATURE: ADVOCATES FOR REFORM ARE BETTING THAT CORRUPTION AND OTHER CHARGES 
ARE THE AMMUNITION THEY NEED TO PERSUADE THE VOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Safe as most members are in their individual districts, the California 
Legislature nevertheless faces a set of tough elections in 1990. Even when 
angry voters are unable to oust members whose tenures were made secure by the 
1981-82 redistrictings, the electorate will have other ways of expressing 
displeasure with the Legislature. An unusual smorgasbord of legislative-reform 
measures seems destined for the 1990 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers can be expected to try extra hard to be on their best behavior and to 
do all they can to avoid offending the public, but it's probably too late. 
Nearly 20 years of freewheeling fund-raising practices have caught up with the 
Legislature, and its collective image is more tarnished than it's been in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
One state senator already is on trial in Sacramento on federal charges of 
corruption. A breakthrough in the FBI's long investigation of fund-raising 
practices of other lawmakers occurred recently when a key legislative staffer 
pleaded guilty to extorting $12,500 on behalf of her bosses. She is expected to 
cooperate with federal prosecutors looking into possible illegal campaign 
fund-raising by other lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Still other problems beset individual legislators. The Lincoln Savings &amp; 
Loan scandal, for example, has touched the California Legislature as well as 
the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
As these troubles continue to command newspaper headlines and television news 
time, the collective image of the Legislature inevitably will deteriorate 
further -- just as campaigning starts seriously on the various reform measures. 
Their sponsors will have plenty of ammunition in arguing that change is 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Several proposed ballot measures would limit the terms of lawmakers. At least 
one, an initiative by Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp as part of his campaign for 
the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, is likely to qualify for the June 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's proposal outrages some of his fellow Democrats who occupy 
legislative leadership posts. They see him as trying to make political hay at 
their expense. This perception, of course, is quite accurate, although his 
proposal would apply to all elected state officials and not just to 
legislators. Van de Kamp's initiative also would make officials subject to 
stricter ethical standards and limitations on outside income. 
</P>
<P>
That makes for interesting speculation about how long a honeymoon Van de Kamp 
would enjoy with the Legislature if he were elected governor. The sweetness and 
light might not last through Inauguration Day. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly less disturbing to lawmakers will be two competing initiatives to reform 
the redistricting process and prevent the kind of gerrymanders that have been 
enacted every 10 years by the Legislature's majority-party members. Sponsors of 
one of these initiative proposals announced last week that they had gathered 
965,000 signatures on qualifying petitions. They're confident that this is more 
than enough to place the measure on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Just about the same number of signatures were obtained earlier for another 
measure that would go beyond redistricting by imposing various ethical reforms 
on lawmakers. This, says its chief sponsor, Marin County businessman Gary 
Flynn, should add to its voter appeal. 
</P>
<P>
If forced to choose between one plan or another, state lawmakers probably would 
find the Flynn measure preferable to the rival proposal originated by San Mateo 
County Supervisor Tom Huening. Under the Flynn-sponsored measure, the 
Legislature still would have its finger in the redistricting pie. Flynn's 
reforms would allow the Legislature, although acting under new constraints, to 
continue its redistricting responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
That's the Flynn measure's chief flaw. A requirement that redistricting be 
subject to a two-thirds approval of each legislative house might eliminate the 
kind of abuses that took place in the 1981-82 gerrymanders, yet not prevent 
"sweetheart deals" in which lawmakers of both parties reshape districts to 
provide all incumbents with maximum protection from voter wrath. 
</P>
<P>
The Huening proposal recognizes the conflict of interest inherent in 
legislative action on reapportionment. That measure would accomplish greater 
reform by establishing a citizens commission to oversee the process. 
</P>
<P>
Given all the adverse news about lawmakers recently and the prospects for even 
more, voter approval of some reforms seems inevitable. The best hope that the 
Legislature's stand-pat elements have is that the least disruptive changes will 
pass.

CONSERVING OUR WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "A Taste of Shortages to Come"(Dec. 4) correctly addressed the 
impending water crisis and pointed out the most effective immediate solution: 
water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
What your editorial completely ignored may well be one of the most effective 
long-term solutions to Southern California's water deficit: I refer to water 
reclamation and reuse for a wide range of applications such as landscape 
irrigation, industrial uses, ground-water recharge, toilet flushing in new 
commercial high-rise buildings and other uses short of direct potable use. 
</P>
<P>
The technology for safe, dependable water reuse is here, now, as demonstrated 
by our own neighboring communities in Las Virgenes, Long Beach, Cerritos, 
Walnut, and several locations in Orange County and other California localities. 
The city of Phoenix, Ariz., is planning potable reuse and is designing a 
pilot-scale project now. California law does not permit potable reuse at any 
level of treatment at the present time, due to lingering health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
While health concerns persist in spite of demonstrated safety of water reuse 
for the less-intimate uses, reclamation will become an increasingly important 
part of our future water supply picture. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a consistent source of potentially usable water being dumped out to the 
ocean every day that could be further treated, placed into a separate 
distribution system and sent back to irrigate parks, supply many types of 
industries and free up the potable water that is now used for those purposes. 
The extra water thus freed would serve as a reserve to meet our shortages, just 
as if a new reservoir, canal or pipeline had been constructed. 
</P>
<P>
Water reclamation on a large scale, as I am suggesting, would require much 
advance planning, user cooperation, legislative muscle and political support. 
But, above all, it needs public awareness of its potential to reduce future 
water shortage. 
</P>
<P>
The Times would do the public a great service by indicating the relative 
significance and potential importance of water reuse among your list of 
solutions to this immense and immediate problem.

THE TWO-TERM ILLUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reforms of the Progressive era made California's state and local 
governments widely admired national models. But now the ability of most of 
those measures to guarantee open, honest government has declined. This is why a 
new reform movement has begun. Many of the proposals being advanced as part of 
it are welcome and constructive; others, particularly the suggestion that 
limits be placed on the number of terms an elected official may serve, would 
create problems more serious than any they might solve. 
</P>
<P>
The widespread frustration that attracts people to such proposals is 
understandable. On the state level, for example, the Progressive reformers' 
cherished instrument of direct democracy -- the initiative -- has become little 
more than another tool of political technology: Too often nowadays, ballot 
propositions are devices by which candidates can circumvent legal spending 
limits. Locally, Los Angeles' nonpartisan, managerial form of city government 
recently has been reluctant to deal not only with complex policy issues -- such 
as growth -- but also with allegations of its own malfeasance or corruption, as 
in the as-yet unresolved case of Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
The melancholy situation engendered by such institutional decadence can be seen 
either as an historical misfortune or as an historic opportunity. This was the 
attitude taken by Los Angeles' Cowan Commission. Its far-reaching proposals for 
the reform of local government ought to be passed by Los Angeles' City Council 
and closely studied by other municipalities. The commission's approach, which 
includes tough conflict-of-interest laws and public disclosure provisions, 
offers far more promise than attempts to use the initiative process to impose 
legal limits on the number of terms elected officials may serve. 
</P>
<P>
Two such problematic efforts currently are seeking signatures to qualify for 
the ballot. One, part of a statewide reform package, is being promoted by Atty. 
Gen. John Van de Kamp as part of campaign to win the Democrats' gubernatorial 
nomination. The other measure, which would deny Los Angeles' elected officials 
more than two consecutive terms in the same post, is being advanced by a 
coalition of neighborhood groups and unsuccessful candidates for local office. 
Both proposals ought to be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Superficially attractive and emotionally appealing though they may be, term 
limits are almost always of dubious legality. The courts already have struck 
them down for cities without charters and are considering challenges to their 
application in municipalities with charters, such as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Term limits are almost always bad public policy as well. In those cities -- and 
on the state level -- passage of term limits also would upset the balance of 
power between elected officials, who often require years of service to command 
the details of complicated policy questions, and senior civil servants, who are 
far less easily held accountable by the public. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most disturbing, imposition of term limits would constitute a 
collective admission that both our government and our politics have failed. 
Such limits presume that public service must inevitably corrupt the majority of 
those who seek it. This is a dark perspective, indeed, and, if true, suggests 
that California's problems are beyond mending by any ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
Term limits scoff at the ability of the people to recognize official corruption 
for what it is and to hold those who yield to it accountable through the normal 
political process: After all, whether the rascals have served one term or 10, 
they always can be voted out of office or recalled. There is no evidence that 
the people of California are either incompetent to work their will through the 
electoral process or that they wish to be relieved of the responsibility of 
political participation.

Great God Almighty, did you hear what they were singing? Did you hear the 
voices in the thousands at Wenceslaus Square? 
</P>
<P>
We have witnessed a mad rush to gain credit for the events in Eastern Europe. 
Some say that Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush in their stalwart stand 
against communism were the moving factors. Others point to heroes past, Joe 
McCarthy and even John Birch. Were they the spiritual forebears of the students 
in Prague? 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that none of these merit the accolades. Blind ranting against the 
"evil empire" saved no one in Prague in 1968, or in Budapest in 1956, or in 
Afghanistan for all of those horrible bloody years. If Russian tanks do not 
assault the gates of Prague or of East Berlin or Budapest now, it is because 
Gorbachev will not send them. That is the difference. It is a difference well 
known to the students of Tian An Men Square and the survivors of massacres 
past. 
</P>
<P>
And who else may we thank for the thousands who protest, who with their shouts 
and their songs have brought down governments? 
</P>
<P>
Is it not true that they have been inspired and bolstered by other Americans -- 
those who took to the streets and lunch counters, who offered themselves in 
sacrifice so that their brothers and sisters could be set free. 
</P>
<P>
Is it too much to say that at the back of the crowd in solidarity with all who 
have placed themselves in the tenuous forefront of history, the souls of Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr., Medgar Evers and others stood, listened to the songs 
and joined hands?

It's good to read something other than euphoric nonsense ("Bush, a Giving Guy, 
Gets Nothing," by Patrick Buchanan, Opinion, Dec. 10) about the Malta summit. 
As long as the Russians hold 11,000 warheads at our head, they can't be counted 
as friends, no matter the rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans and the Russians have done more than any other peoples to cause 
death and destruction in the 20th Century. Before we feel glee over the loss of 
power of the communists in East Germany, before we praise the possibility of 
German reunification, before we call Mikhail Gorbachev or any other Russian 
friend, remember the basic casualty figure of World War II: 50 million dead. 
That figure doesn't include the deaths of World War I or the Stalinist purges 
of the 1950s.

WHAT PRICE FASHION IF THAT 'BARGAIN' CAME FROM A SWEATSHOP?; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: AS BEFORE, THE GARMENT INDUSTRY EXPLOITS IMMIGRANTS AND CHILDREN. UNLIKE 
BEFORE, WE HAVE PROTECTIVE LAWS THAT NEED ONLY TO BE ENFORCED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELEANOR GOLD HIRSCH, Eleanor Gold Hirsch is a writer in North Hollywood and 
former research economist specializing in labor history. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times articles describing garment sweatshop operations in Orange County 
were a shock to those of us who take a "Made in the U.S.A." label as assurance 
of a law-abiding as well as a quality manufacturer. It is abhorrent that adults 
work in exploitative conditions; it is tragic that children do. 
</P>
<P>
A century ago, child labor was common in America in many industries, including 
the "needle trades." Youngsters of all ages did assorted jobs helping their 
parents make clothing in home sweatshops. Others worked in sweatshops in 
tenement basements and factory lofts. Children under 14, then the minimum age 
for employment, were hidden under cloth-draped tables or taught to lie about 
their ages when factory inspectors made the rounds. It was common for the 
youngsters to work up to 15 hours a day for about 40 cents. 
</P>
<P>
There are other striking similarities between yesterday's and today's 
sweatshops. One is the abuse of immigrant workers. In the late 1800s and early 
1900s, immigrants who'd "made it" typically employed more recent arrivals under 
horrendous working conditions. Many of the same excuses were given then as now: 
Nobody else will hire them because they can't speak English; it's better for 
them to work at a low wage than starve; bad as conditions here may be, they are 
better than in the old country. Yesterday, the old country was usually Russia, 
Poland or Italy; today, it's Vietnam, Mexico or El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Descriptions of the mini-sweatshops springing up today in garages and 
apartments resemble those graphically described by reformers Jacob Riis and 
Jane Addams at the turn of the century. Again children work with parents late 
into the night in cramped, airless quarters also used for eating and sleeping. 
Infants breathe air contaminated by dust from cuttings of material. The threat 
of tuberculosis and other respiratory disease has reappeared. 
</P>
<P>
As in the past, fire is a particular hazard in the "needle trades" because of 
the highly flammable quality of cloth. This was seen in all its horror in the 
recent fire in a high-rise garment-industry building in downtown Los Angeles. 
In 1911, a disastrous fire at the Triangle Waist Co. in New York, which took 
147 lives, became a rallying point for legislating workplace safety standards. 
Yet, as even a Los Angeles Fire Department official acknowledged, safety codes 
must be enforced, and enforcement has a low priority in government budgets. 
</P>
<P>
When unions were stronger, they acted as watchdogs to police workplace safety 
enforcement. Now, much of our clothing is manufactured by non-union companies. 
We must find new ways to guarantee that the clothes we purchase, at least those 
made in America, are manufactured in accordance with labor laws. One way is to 
look for the union label when we shop. It does provide some guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
Another solution worth reviving originated in the National Consumers' League in 
the late 1890s when few unions existed. The movement spread from New York over 
several states. The league devised a label issued only to companies that 
adhered to certain standards in wages, hours, rest periods and sanitary 
conditions, gave equal pay for equal work irrespective of sex, and did not 
employ children. The agreement also required that all stitched goods be made on 
the manufacturer's premises. Lists of participating firms were published. Why 
can't a similar system be used today? Why can't labels be attached to garments 
verifying that they were made in compliance with labor laws? 
</P>
<P>
We need to make tough decisions about our own participation in maintaining the 
status quo. "Bargains" may indicate cost-cutting at the garment workers' 
expense. We probably will have to pay more for lawfully made clothes, and that 
may require indulging ourselves and our children a little less or wearing the 
same outfits a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, public officials must be committed to forcing garment makers 
and subcontractors either to comply with existing legislation or cease 
operation. Appropriate city, county, state and federal departments must see 
that these companies are licensed to do business, pay city taxes, withhold 
income tax as required, make payments on behalf of employees for Social 
Security, unemployment and disability benefits, and maintain health standards 
with respect to air, light, seating, drinking water, restrooms and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, enforcing all the pertinent laws will close down marginal subcontractors 
and put people out of work. But is this a valid reason to justify a situation 
where clothing is manufactured with the labor of children? I think not. If a 
company can't operate without exploiting its workers, child or adult, then it 
should go out of business. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the plight of those who lose their jobs if marginal firms close? 
The surgery to cut out sick businesses will bring hardships, but public, 
private and volunteer agencies can help families bridge the transition. And one 
better-paid wage-earner per family may compensate for three or four earning a 
pittance. 
</P>
<P>
Putting the sweatshops out of business is a formidable, difficult task. If we 
must pay higher prices to buy clothing made in conformance with proper labor 
standards, so be it. It's bad enough that sweatshops thrived yesterday and are 
back in business today. We must say "no" to them for tomorrow. It is a moral 
imperative.

<P>
A font of originality, Rep. Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.) is again watering the 
nation's imagination. He wants to change the national anthem from "The Star 
Spangled Banner" to "America the Beautiful." His idea, proposed as legislation 
in Congress last January, has won the support of 315,000 Parade magazine 
readers who responded favorably to the question, should we change our national 
anthem? About 74,000 said "no". 
</P>
<P>
The Jacobs theory -- that "The Star Spangled Banner" is a martial song that 
should be scrapped in favor of "America the Beautiful," which "celebrates our 
power and our ability to live and work in peace" -- is on the mark, but only by 
half. 
</P>
<P>
The Star Spangled War Song deserves to be ditched, or at least dispatched to 
the parade grounds at West Point. But its replacement with "America the 
Beautiful" is little improvement. What's the appeal of a psuedo-patriotic hymn 
that turns God into a nationalistic prop and America into a surreal Shangri-La? 
</P>
<P>
"America the Beautiful" is provincial, not national. It's about Colorado. The 
words were written by a sub-minor poet -- Katherine Lee Bates -- who ascended 
Pikes Peak in 1893 and was apparently turned giddy by the rarefied heights. 
</P>
<P>
What's odd is that the congressman, strong in democratic populism, didn't come 
up with the one song that gives full expression to the popular will: "This Land 
is Your Land." 
</P>
<P>
Woodie Guthrie's treasure, called "the greatest song ever written about 
America" by Bruce Springsteen, begins with the familiar lines: 
</P>
<P>
 This land is your land, this land is my land, 
</P>
<P>
 From California to the New York island 
</P>
<P>
 From the redwood forests to the gulfstream waters, 
</P>
<P>
 This land was made for you and me. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, these verses: 
</P>
<P>
 As I was walking that ribbon of highway, 
</P>
<P>
 I saw above me the endless skyway, 
</P>
<P>
 I saw below me that golden valley, 
</P>
<P>
 This land was made for you and me. 
</P>
<P>
 I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps 
</P>
<P>
 To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts, 
</P>
<P>
 And all around me a voice was sounding, 
</P>
<P>
 This land was made for you and me. 
</P>
<P>
 Singable, hand-clappingly lively and populist, Guthrie's work is a fit 
national anthem because it is a song of the folk. "I am out to sing songs that 
will prove to you that this is your world," he wrote in the early 1950s when 
the Library of Congress established a collection of his recordings. "I am out 
to sing the songs that make you take pride in yourself and in your work. And 
the songs I sing are made up for the most part by all sorts of folks like you." 
</P>
<P>
From 1936 to 1952, Woody Guthrie produced about 1,000 songs, every one of them 
as truthful as the minstrel who sang them. The songs were messages of 
affirmation. "The main secret about singing," Guthrie wrote, "ain't so much to 
have other folks listen as it is to pick up your own spirits." 
</P>
<P>
With such a national anthem as "This Land is Your Land," the picking up will 
lift the country higher than any bombs bursting in air or purple mountain 
majesties, whatever they are.

<P>
REGULATION: UNSAFE STORAGE OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE AT OUR TWO PLUTONIUM-PRODUCING 
PLANTS COULD LEAD TO A LETHAL EXPLOSION. BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ISN'T 
PAYING ATTENTION.

<P>
On Sept. 29, 1957, a radioactive cloud 10 kilometers across and carrying 11,000 
curies of strontium-90 spread over the towns of Kyshtym and Chelyabinsk in the 
Soviet Urals. An area larger than Connecticut was seriously contaminated. More 
than 10,000 residents were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
The deadly cloud (one one-hundredth of a curie of strontium-90 is likely to 
cause death from bone cancer) was created when a storage tank containing highly 
radioactive wastes from plutonium production exploded. The tank's cooling 
system had failed and liquid wastes began to dry, leaving an explosive mixture 
at the bottom of the tank. Soon, runaway reactions produced the explosion. The 
tank's 3-foot-thick concrete cover was blown off. 
</P>
<P>
Could it happen in the United States? The Department of Energy doesn't want you 
to think so. But the answer is yes. Indeed, the more that is learned about the 
accident near Kyshtym, the more ominous are the dangers of a similar explosion 
occurring in eastern Washington state or South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Hanford, Wash., and Savannah River, S.C., are the sites of the country's two 
complexes that produce plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. About 100 million 
gallons of highly radioactive wastes are stored in 14 tanks at Hanford and in 
20 at Savannah River. 
</P>
<P>
The danger at Hanford stems from a chemical treatment applied to the wastes in 
the 1950s. That treatment, which was supposed to precipitate radioactive wastes 
to the tank bottom, made the mixture potentially explosive. 
</P>
<P>
At Savannah River, hydrogen and organic vapor generated by high-level 
radioactive wastes could lead to an explosion if the ventilation system failed 
for an extended time. A buildup of hydrogen reaching or exceeding the lower 
explosive limit has taken place at Savannah River on at least two occasions. An 
explosion there of a magnitude comparable to Kyshtym's could release an even 
greater quantity of strontium-90 and cesium-137 over areas that are much more 
densely populated than those contaminated in the Urals. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department's handling of this problem does not inspire confidence. 
It has misrepresented or ignored its own data, thereby failing to learn from 
the Kyshtym experience. For example, the department continues to downplay the 
risk of a tank explosion at Savannah River by citing only the probability of 
any given tank exploding. Since 20 tanks at Savannah River are at risk, 
however, the probability of an explosion occurring in at least one of them is 
considerably higher than the department's estimate. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department also claims, disingenuously, that even if a waste tank at 
Savannah River exploded, only a single gallon of the roughly 1 million gallons 
of radioactive material stored in the tank would become airborne. The Kyshtym 
data seriously undermine this estimate. Calculations we have performed suggest 
that a severe explosion in a single tank at Savannah River could release up to 
100 times the strontium-90 and cesium-137 that descended on the area around 
Kyshtym. Should that occur, large portions of South Carolina and Georgia may 
have to be evacuated and essentially written off for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the department commissioned a study of the explosive potential of the 
mixture resulting from the chemical treatment applied at Hanford in the 1950s. 
It disregarded the results of that study. Indeed, the Energy Department's own 
five-year waste-management plan does not even mention the possibility of a tank 
explosion at Hanford. Despite the promises of Energy Secretary James D. 
Watkins, this lack of scientific integrity is so institutionalized in the 
department that it cannot bring itself to address, much less redress, some of 
the most pressing and dangerous issues of radioactive-waste management. 
</P>
<P>
An independent agency must be created to manage the radioactive waste generated 
at nuclear facilities. Failing that, independent oversight and peer review of 
all Energy Department efforts in the field of waste management must be 
established.

BENGALS DO A NUMBER ON OILERS, WIN, 61-7

<TEXT>
<P>
Boomer Esiason threw four touchdown passes in single-digit temperatures as the 
Cincinnati Bengals tied a club scoring record in a 61-7 victory over the 
Houston Oilers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The victory didn't keep Cincinnati (8-7) in title contention in the AFC Central 
-- Cleveland's 23-17 overtime victory over Minnesota means the Bengals can only 
win a wild-card berth. And they're a longshot for that. 
</P>
<P>
But by scoring 61 points and preventing Houston (9-6) from clinching the 
division title, the Bengals got a sense of satisfaction from beating a team 
they have traded harsh words with over the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like playing against the bully in your high school," Esiason said. "You 
finally reach up and slug him in the teeth and he runs away." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Sam Wyche said: "We don't like this team. We don't like their people. 
When you get a chance to do it (run up the score), you do it. I wish today this 
was a five-quarter game." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers' loss sets up a showdown for the AFC Central title next Saturday 
against Cleveland (8-6-1) in the Astrodome. A victory would give the Oilers 
their first outright Central title. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what it takes to bounce back from a loss," quarterback Warren Moon 
said. "We'll just have to be more focused next week." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers let a chance to clinch the title slip off their icy fingertips, 
turning the ball over five times as Cincinnati took command, 31-0, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati didn't let up. When they were ahead, 45-0, the Bengals recovered an 
onside kick and kept throwing the ball. They even padded their lead with 21 
seconds left on Jim Breech's 30-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The 61 points equaled the club record, set in a 61-17 victory at the Astrodome 
in 1972. The Bengals' 589 yards of offense was the second-highest total in team 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"Our only real regret there is that Lee Johnson missed that extra point (after 
a fourth-quarter touchdown)," Wyche said. 
</P>
<P>
The drubbing didn't humble the Oilers, who enjoy their reputation for talking 
on the field and leading the NFL in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"They ain't no good team," cornerback Cris Dishman said of Cincinnati. "We were 
just playing bad. They got some breaks. They were trying to embarrass us and 
run up the score. 
</P>
<P>
"It's their style of play. Yeah, we're bitter. The guy (Wyche) could have run 
the ball. Instead, he kept throwing the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Esiason completed 20 of 27 passes for 326 yards without an interception, 
hitting on 11 straight during one stretch in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Brown caught six passes for 107 yards and two touchdowns and Tim McGee 
had six catches for 147 yards, including a 74-yard pass play in the third 
quarter.

49ERS BENEFIT FROM BILLS' GIVEAWAY 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, the Buffalo Bills have gone ice-cold in December. 
</P>
<P>
Handed two big opportunities Sunday -- Miami's loss to Indianapolis and San 
Francisco's decision to rest quarterback Joe Montana's injured ribs -- the 
Bills bobbled away five second-half turnovers and lost to the 49ers, 21-10. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig rushed for 105 yards and the go-ahead touchdown for the 
opportunistic 49ers, who were outgained 301 yards to 283 but turned their 
opponent's misplays into a victory for the second straight week. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Young was unspectacular in place of Montana but still passed for one 
touchdown to Jerry Rice and rushed for another as San Francisco relied on its 
ground game for a change. 
</P>
<P>
"We really wanted to establish the running game," said Rice, who caught just 
three passes as the 49ers ran the ball 43 times. "If we really can balance 
everything out with the running and the passing, we're going to be hard to 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
The game meant little to the 49ers, 13-2 and assured of the home-field 
advantage throughout the NFC playoffs, and everything to the 8-7 Bills, who are 
now in a three-way tie for first place in the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
But the difference wasn't apparent as the Bills lost for the fourth time in 
five games and fourth straight on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"All the last few games have been in our grasp," Bills nose tackle Fred Smerlas 
said. "How many teams beat us this year? None -- we beat ourselves. . . . When 
you keep cutting your throat, eventually you run out of blood." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills could have clinched their second straight divisional title with a win 
following Indianapolis' 42-13 rout of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they left here tied with the Colts and Dolphins and pondering another 
late-season slump -- they've hurt their postseason prospects by losing three of 
their last four in each of the last three years -- heading into Saturday's road 
game against the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
They still will win the division with a victory, but could miss the playoffs 
with a loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills set up a 21-point San Francisco burst in 5:10 of the second half by 
losing the ball in their own territory on three straight possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Beleaguered Bill quarterback Jim Kelly was 26 of 42 for 265 yards, but threw 
three interceptions, two in the second half. He scored Buffalo's only touchdown 
on a one-yard run with 7:49 remaining before Andre Reed's fumble and another 
interception killed any comeback hopes.

<P>
Don Majkowski and the Green Bay Packers, the masters of miracle comebacks, 
still need more magic to cap their longshot season with a longshot trip to the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski and the Packers did their part Sunday, beating the Chicago Bears, 
40-28, with an offense so sharp that punter Don Bracken set foot on the field 
only to hold for field goals and extra points. 
</P>
<P>
And Cleveland chipped in, beating Minnesota, 23-17, in overtime to leave the 
Vikings and Packers in a tie for the NFC Central lead at 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
But Minnesota has the better division record, so the Packers will have to win 
at Dallas next Sunday and the Vikings will have to lose a week from tonight 
against Cincinnati if Green Bay is to win the Central title. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers also have an outside shot at a wild-card spot. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what happens, I'm really proud of these guys," said Coach Lindy 
Infante, whose Packers were 4-12 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The confidence is there now. We're definitely a contender now," Majkowski 
said. "We have to keep our fingers crossed and see what happens. Hopefully 
we'll get a little help." 
</P>
<P>
As it has been all year, Majkowski was the catalyst. 
</P>
<P>
He threw for one score and ran for two more, Keith Woodside had a 68-yard 
touchdown run and 116 rushing yards and Chris Jacke contributed four field 
goals for Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers rolled up 456 total yards, 217 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"We went into the game with a lot of respect for the Bears' defense," Infante 
said. "I was shocked we were able to do as much as we did." 
</P>
<P>
One thing they didn't do was punt, after kicking 17 times the last two weeks. 
Or, as Chicago Coach Mike Ditka put it, "Any time a team doesn't punt the ball 
once on you, you've got a problem." 
</P>
<P>
The victory guaranteed the Packers their first winning season since 1978 and 
marked their most victories since 1972. It also was the first time in eight 
years they've swept the season series from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears lost for the fifth consecutive time, their longest losing streak in 
11 years. It also ensured that Chicago, which is 6-9 after losing nine of its 
last 11, will finish under .500 for the first time since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Take all your hurts and put them together and you can't even imagine how much 
I hurt," Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay's win was the product of offensive domination -- the Packers scored 
on six of their eight possessions.

TRUDEAU, DICKERSON SPUR THE COLTS, 42-13

<P>
It was a new Jack Trudeau and the old Eric Dickerson with a slightly different 
twist. 
</P>
<P>
Trudeau, pounded by opposing defenses and stung by the taunts and boos of 
Indianapolis fans all season, passed for a career-high four touchdowns Sunday, 
leading the Colts over the Miami Dolphins, 42-13. 
</P>
<P>
His top receiver was Dickerson, who had nine catches and also ran for 107 yards 
and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"The key was Eric running his routes on the back side of our formations," said 
Trudeau, who was knocked unconscious and hospitalized with a concussion only a 
week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"He did a great job, and when I saw he was really attuned to what we were 
doing, I was pretty sure we were going to have a great day. I don't know if 
they really knew what we were going to do." 
</P>
<P>
The victory lifted the Colts (8-7) into a three-way tie for first place in the 
AFC East with Miami and Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Miami Coach Don Shula called the loss "a major disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a poor performance when everything is so meaningful in the game and the 
season is on the line," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half we couldn't generate anything. Our running game struggled. 
Their offense was patient and did a good job. Dickerson is a great back. They 
threw to him underneath, giving him running room, and he turned it loose." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson, bothered most of the season by a hamstring injury and frustrated to 
the point that he has dropped hints about retirement, scored his first rushing 
touchdowns in a month and tied Jim Brown for second place in NFL history with 
the 58th 100-yard rushing game of his career. Trudeau completed 23 of 35 passes 
for 195 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis led, 14-13, at halftime, then put the game out of reach with 
third-quarter touchdowns by Dickerson on a one-yard run and James Pruitt on a 
five-yard reception. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as the offensive point production was encouraging, I still have to 
(praise) the defense," Colt Coach Ron Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins rushed for only 41 yards and had three turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Fredd Young intercepted a pass by Miami's Dan Marino at the Dolphins' 28 on the 
first series of the fourth quarter and seven plays later Trudeau passed six 
yards to Albert Bentley for another touchdown, making it 35-13. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts got the ball back 16 seconds later when Marino was sacked by Jon Hand 
and fumbled at the Miami 18. Dickerson then ran four times, scoring from the 
three to give the Colts their highest point production of the season.

topped this year's list of the 10 most boring celebrities, according to the 
Boring Institute of Maplewood, N.J. Next on the list were two women who spent a 
lot of time in court in 1989, tax criminal Leona Helmsley and cop-slapper Zsa 
Zsa Gabor, with Cher ranking fourth on the list and Malcolm Forbes, Elizabeth 
Taylor's part-time escort, fifth. Rounding out the list were fallen baseball

Sonya Friedman Leaves, Viscott Adds Hour: Radio psychologist David Viscott will 
expand his current KABC-AM program to two hours starting today. His 1-2 p.m. 
show will now be heard from 1-3 p.m., replacing fellow talk radio psychologist 
Sonya Friedman, who had been on the station from 2-3 p.m. Friedman has left the 
station in order to originate her Cable News Network show from New York, which 
will bring her closer to her husband and family in Detroit. Friedman 
temporarily replaced Viscott when he left the radio station from June to 
August. Claudia Puig

NORNING BRIEFING: THESE COACHES HAVE HEART-TO-HEART TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Majerus, the University of Utah's basketball coach, was understandably 
nervous before undergoing coronary bypass surgery Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Majerus said he called a friend, Indiana University assistant coach Don 
Donoher. "I told Don, 'I'm really apprehensive,' " Majerus said. " 'I don't 
know what I'm getting into. I wonder if Bob (Knight, Indiana's coach) could 
give me Bo Schembechler's phone number.' At 7 o'clock the next morning, 
Schembechler was on the phone to me." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler, the University of Michigan coach who will retire after the 
Wolverines play USC in the Rose Bowl, underwent open heart surgery in 1970 and 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
"He talked to me a long time and explained everything," Majerus told the 
Herald-Times of Bloomington, Ind. "And he said, 'You're going to be better than 
ever, and you're going to feel better. You're going to be more productive.' " 
</P>
<P>
Majerus, who coached at Ball State in Indiana, still is in intensive care at a 
Salt Lake City hospital. He said he plans to change his diet. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a cured man," he said. "I'm never going to that Choo-Choo Train and eat a 
bucket of ribs again. I don't know if I can go with a carrot souffle, but I 
can't eat every rib in the house like I used to." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Dec. 18, 1964, who scored 56 points, including 18 in the final 
quarter, in a 111-107 victory over the Lakers? 
</P>
<P>
Camera shy: Don't expect any interviews with Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan 
during the Eagles-New Orleans Saints telecast on ABC tonight. Ryan still is 
fuming over some comments by the ABC crew during Philadelphia's loss to the 
Bears at Chicago Oct. 2 and said he isn't going to talk to them. 
</P>
<P>
"They put down Buddy Ryan," he said. "They put down (Eagle quarterback) Randall 
Cunningham. They put down our football team. I don't have any respect for them. 
We don't need these guys. They need us." 
</P>
<P>
He touched 'em all: There's only so much good a pregame pep talk from Dodger 
Manager Tom Lasorda can do. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda, in Indiana for a visit, gave a brief talk to the Valparaiso Crusaders 
basketball team Saturday night before their nonconference home game against 
Xavier. 
</P>
<P>
The Crusaders appeared fired up as they emerged from the locker room after 
Lasorda's talk and, despite their 0-6 record, they took a 12-5 lead against the 
Musketeers. But the magic wore off, and Xavier improved to 3-1 with a 95-63 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Oscar Robertson of the Cincinnati Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: John Brockman of Spring Valley, Ohio, who saw his first race at 
Hialeah in 1939, on rumors that the Florida race track will be turned into a 
cemetery: "It's like a champion that's over the hill. Time has passed it by, 
that's all." GARR KLUENDER

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leave it to the New York Piper Cubs to take the excitement even out of a Los 
Angeles Rams game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It shouldn't be long before Cleveland Gary, the Rams' powerful-running rookie, 
makes a successful transition from garbage time to crunch time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
How good a year are the Rams having? If they beat the Patriots on Sunday in New 
England, they will equal John Robinson's best NFL regular-season record of 
11-5. . . . 
</P>
<P>
After it was announced in the Anaheim Stadium press box that Cleveland had 
beaten Minnesota on a touchdown from field-goal formation, someone quipped, 
"Great call.". . . . 
</P>
<P>
The smartest fans in Anaheim Sunday stayed until the end of the game, thus 
avoiding the traffic jam. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You'll see this one on "Football Follies." In the third quarter, Buford McGee 
caught a pass from Ram quarterback Jim Everett and fumbled. The ball was picked 
up by Jet cornerback James Hasty, who fumbled when hit by McGee. Aaron Cox 
recovered for the Rams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I guess it was too much to expect the Raiders to win in Seattle although the 
Seahawks were only 2-4 at home prior to Sunday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Raider substitution pattern and play selection were curious. No Marcus 
Allen in there to dive over the top from near the goal line in the first 
quarter. And Bo Jackson seemed to disappear after performing at peak efficiency 
early. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Happiness is having to listen to sportscasters explain NFL playoff 
possibilities only one more week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you watched the two Saturday games on the tube start to finish -- the New 
York Giants' shutout of Dallas and Denver's shutout of Phoenix -- you deserve a 
medal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It appears that Penn State is going to get a chance to avenge that 14-3 defeat 
to USC in the 1923 Rose Bowl after all. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The odds favoring USC over Michigan dipped from 2 1/2 to 1 1/2 points at some 
Las Vegas sports books after Bo Schembechler announced that he was going to 
retire. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible that Paul Hackett actually will be hired to replace Mike 
Gottfried at Pitt? The veteran assistant has been mentioned as a candidate to 
fill virtually every college or pro vacancy in the last decade. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' signing of Fernando Valenzuela will be significant only if they 
trade another starting pitcher for a center fielder. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Losing those first two games of the road trip to Washington and Orlando may 
have been beneficial to the Lakers, who have taken nothing for granted since. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Clipper guard Ron Harper -- who hung, floated, glided and made great 
last-second decisions in a 39-point performance against Denver Saturday -- has 
better body control than anybody in the NBA except Michael Jordan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
At age 35, Nugget forward Walter Davis can still shoot the lights out. In fact, 
the lights did go out at the Sports Arena after pregame warmups. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Chick Hearn after a questionable call: "You can tell the good players. They 
don't complain." Has he forgotten about Oscar Robertson? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics look old. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now you can start comparing Patrick Ewing to the great centers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ron Shelton, writer-director of "Blaze" and "Bull Durham," is back on the 
disabled list after being put there three times during his minor league 
baseball career. He suffered a broken right wrist while playing basketball at 
the Hollywood YMCA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
With his patient winning ride aboard Ten Keys in the Bay Meadows Handicap that 
was simulcast to Hollywood Park Saturday, Kent Desormeaux showed why he set the 
record for most victories by a jockey in a year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Macho Camacho-Vinny Pazienza news conference last week was the only one 
I've ever attended where highlights of previous news conferences were shown. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Women's basketball has caught on at Stanford, where 5,425 saw the Cardinal 
defeat Tennessee Friday night in Maples Pavilion. The next night, only 4,225 
watched the Stanford men beat San Francisco. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Larry Robinson might be right about the Kings trying to play too much of an 
offensive game, but he hasn't exactly been performing like an All-Star on 
defense lately, either. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It will be a homecoming for former King center Ralph Backstrom when he coaches 
Denver University against Michigan State tonight in the Great Western Freeze 
Out at the Forum. . . . Clipper Coach Don Casey on the Sports Arena crowds: 
"They remind me of those at the Palestra in Philadelphia. They're 
knowledgeable. They even coach pretty well from behind our bench." . . .

BIG PLAYS 
</P>
<P>
Holder Mike Pagel, Cleveland's backup quarterback, threw a 14-yard touchdown 
pass to linebacker Van Waiters on a fake field-goal attempt in overtime as the 
Browns remained in contention for the AFC Central Division title with a 23-17 
victory over the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Mark Rypien, who was sidelined with a sprained neck less than three 
minutes into the first quarter, returned midway through the second period and 
sparked three touchdown drives in a span of 3:38 in the third quarter to lift 
the Washington Redskins to a 31-30 victory over Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig rushed for 105 yards and the go-ahead touchdown as San Francisco 
turned three of Buffalo's five turnovers into touchdowns in a 21-10 victory 
over the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOWLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
Houston quarterback Warren Moon completed only nine of 20 passes for 96 yards 
and threw two interceptions before being replaced in the third quarter of the 
Oilers' 61-7 loss to Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie linebacker Derrick Thomas of Kansas City was ejected in the fourth 
quarter for kicking a player in the Chiefs' 20-13 loss to San Diego. Thomas 
refused to comment on the incident, but Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer said: 
"He was frustrated. They were holding him all day, but you can't respond in the 
way that he did. You've got to go out and find a way to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller left the game with blurred vision following a 
sack in the third quarter of the Falcons' 31-30 loss to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay quarterback Vinny Testaverde left the game with a sprained left ankle 
after a sack with 10:54 remaining in the second quarter of the Buccaneers' 33-7 
loss to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Pro Bowl safety Deron Cherry of Kansas City was lost to a knee injury in the 
Chiefs' 20-13 loss to San Diego. Cherry was injured after recovering a fumble 
in the second quarter and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bears' 40-28 loss to Green Bay was their fifth loss in a row, their 
longest losing streak in 11 years. It also guaranteed that Chicago, 6-9 after 
losing nine of its last 11 games, will finish under .500 for the first time 
since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Jet receiver Al Toon, with six catches for 53 yards against the Rams, extended 
to 62 his streak of games with receptions. . . Chief reciever Stephone Paige 
had four catches for 42 yards against San Diego, giving him receptions in 63 
consecutive games. . . Anthony Carter of Minnesota extended to 64 his streak of 
games with receptions with four catches against Cleveland. . . Art Monk of 
Washington has caught a pass in 99 consecutive games after making six 
receptions for 131 yards and two touchdowns against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAKING THEIR POINTS 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati Coach Sam Wyche offered a simple explanation for running up the 
score in the Bengals' 61-7 rout of Houston: He doesn't like the Oilers or their 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals had been waiting for a rematch since a fight-filled game in the 
Astrodome Nov. 13, and their mood was as raw as the weather at Riverfront 
Stadium, where the temperature was nine degrees with a wind-chill factor below 
zero. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like this team," Wyche said. "We don't like their people. When you 
get a chance to do it (run up the score), you do it. I wish today this was a 
five-quarter game." 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals had plenty of time to rub it in. Leading 45-0, they attempted an 
onside kick. On two fourth- 
</P>
<P>
quarter possessions, the Bengals, leading 58-7, ran the ball 13 times and 
passed eight times. They even had Jim Breech kick a 30-yard field goal that 
gave them their final points -- with 21 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
The 61 points matched the Bengals' scoring record and gave them the most 
lopsided victory in the franchise's history. 
</P>
<P>
Glanville had little to say in regard to Wyche's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"They played excellent. They did a great job. There are no excuses," Glanville 
said. "It's our job to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
But Wyche wasn't as guarded in his comments about the Oilers in general and 
Glanville in particular. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry is an unusual coach. He really is an unusual coach," Wyche said. "Drop 
me a note if you find somebody who likes this guy, will you?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson after the Rams' 38-14 victory over the New York Jets: 
"We're determined now. We're in a tournament now where if we win, we keep 
playing. Our position is that we have to win next weekend to make the playoffs. 
Then, if we keep winning, we go all the way to New Orleans (and the Super 
Bowl). It's simple. We have a chance, probably the best chance of any team I've 
coached, to go into postseason and play well." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Coach Mike Ditka after a 40-28 loss to Green Bay, the Bears' fifth 
loss in a row: "Take all your hurts and put them together and you can't even 
imagine how much I hurt." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CLASS ACT 
</P>
<P>
First in line to offer congratulations after Barry Sanders set a team record 
for rushing yards by a rookie was Billy Sims, the player Sanders supplanted in 
the Detroit Lion record books. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, the NFC's leading rusher, gained 104 yards in 21 carries and scored on 
a four-yard run in the Lions' 33-7 victory over Tampa Bay. The performance gave 
him 1,312 yards. Sanders had an 11-yard run with 6:34 to play in the third 
quarter to surpass Sims' previous mark of 1,308 yards, set in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Sims, whose promising career was cut short by a knee injury, rushed onto the 
field to congratulate Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate his support," Sanders said. "I don't know any other running back 
that would have done that. It's something I can look back on and be thankful 
for. It's not something I anticipated. It just happened." 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth 100-yard game for Sanders, who has rushed for more yardage 
than the entire Detroit team rushed for a year ago. With one game remaining, he 
is 125 yards shy of Sims' single-season club mark of 1,437 set in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was just a matter of time after they drafted Barry," said Sims, who 
postponed his return home to Hooks, Tex., by a day to be on hand. "Anybody who 
ever played sports and had some kind of record knows somebody's going to break 
it. I'm just proud I was here to see Barry break mine." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MILESTONES 
</P>
<P>
George Seifert became the winningest first-year coach in NFL history when the 
San Francisco 49ers improved their record to 13-2 with a 21-10 victory over 
Buffalo. Seifert bettered the previous mark of 12 victories shared by John 
Madden (Raiders, 1969), Chuck Knox (Rams, 1973) and Red Miller (Broncos, 1977) 
-- each set in 14-game seasons. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco safety Ronnie Lott became the team's all-time interception leader 
with his 48th career theft. Lott picked off intercepted a pass from Jim Kelly 
that was tipped by receiver Andre Reed. The play set up a touchdown that gave 
the 49ers a 21-3 lead in the fourth quarter. Lott moved past Jimmy Johnson on 
the 49ers' all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
Don Majkowski passed for 244 yards to become only the second quarterback in 
Green Bay history to pass for more than 4,000 yards in a season. Lynn Dickey is 
the other one. Majkowski threw for a touchdown and ran for two others as the 
Packers secured their first winning season since 1978 with a 40-28 win over 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Millard of Minnesota had two sacks, giving him 18 for the season to match 
Alan Page's team record. Millard surpassed teammate Chris Doleman, who has 17. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Dickerson, bothered most of the season by a hamstring injury, scored his 
first rushing touchdown in a month and tied Jim Brown for second place in NFL 
history with the 58th 100-yard rushing game of his career in the Indianapolis 
Colts' 42-13 victory over Miami. Colt quarterback Jack Trudeau, knocked 
unconscious and hospitalized with a concussion a week ago, completed 23 of 35 
passes for 195 yards and a career-high four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Butts, a rookie who spent his college career at Florida State blocking 
for Sammie Smith, rushed for 176 yards in a club-record 39 carries in San 
Diego's 20-13 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City kicker Nick Lowery became the 15th player in NFL history to score 
more than 1,000 points in the Chiefs' 20-13 loss to San Diego. Lowery, who 
converted field-goal attempts of 36 and 30 yards and an extra point, has scored 
1,004 points. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A FINE MESS 
</P>
<P>
Not a good day for sorting out the playoff races when three teams that had a 
chance to clinch their respective division titles with a victory lose. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota, Buffalo and Houston blew opportunities to wrap up berths. A fourth 
contender, Washington, staged a furious comeback to defeat Atlanta but was 
eliminated when the Rams beat the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the final week of the season, it appears that the only thing certain 
about the playoff picture is that the tiebreaker formulas will be put to the 
test. In fact, the AFC races are so muddled that the NFL was unable to list the 
full range of possibilities Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the various races: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE NFC 
</P>
<P>
West Division: The San Francisco 49ers (13-2) have clinched the title and the 
home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams (10-5) can clinch a wild-card berth with a victory at New England next 
week. Even if they lose, the Rams can make it if Minnesota, Green Bay or 
Washington loses. 
</P>
<P>
(Washington is already eliminated, but can still get involved in a tiebreaker 
situation at 10-6 with Green Bay and the Rams that would put the Packers into 
the playoffs by conference record; if there is a two-way tie, the Rams are in 
because they beat Green Bay; but if Washington is involved it becomes a 
three-way tie, with conference records the determinant). 
</P>
<P>
Central Division: The Minnesota Vikings (9-6) must win the division title to 
reach the playoffs; they cannot be a wild card. Minnesota can clinch with a 
victory over Cincinnati next Monday night, or if Green Bay loses to Dallas. The 
Vikings hold the tiebreaker over the Packers because of a better division 
record. 
</P>
<P>
The Green Bay Packers (9-6) must win next week to make the playoffs. If the 
Packers beat Dallas and Minnesota loses to Cincinnati, the Packers win the 
division title. If the Rams and Philadelphia each lose their remaining games 
and Green Bay wins, the Packers are a wild card. 
</P>
<P>
East Division: The Philadelphia Eagles (10-4) need one victory to clinch a 
wild-card spot and would clinch the division title with two victories or, if 
the Giants lose their final game, would clinch with one victory. The Eagles 
have the tiebreaker advantage over New York because they have beaten the Giants 
twice this season. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Giants (11-4) have clinched a wild-card playoff spot and can win 
the division title by winning their last game if Philadelphia loses one of its 
last two. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE AFC 
</P>
<P>
West Division: The Denver Broncos (11-4) have clinched the division title and 
the home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders (8-7) can gain a wild-card berth only by defeating the New York 
Giants on the road next week, coupled with an Indianapolis loss at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City Chiefs (7-7-1) and Seattle Seahawks are a long shots. Both must 
win next week and hope virtually all other contenders lose. 
</P>
<P>
Central Division: The Houston Oilers (9-6) will clinch the division title if 
they win next week at home against Cleveland. Even if Houston loses, it will 
earn a wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland Browns (8-6-1) will win the division title if they beat Houston. 
If Cleveland loses, it can be a wild card. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Bengals (8-7) must win and get a great deal of help to win a 
wild-card berth. Cincinnati could be eliminated by the time it plays next 
Monday night against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Steelers (8-7) must win next week and have almost all the other 
contenders lose. 
</P>
<P>
East Division: The Buffalo Bills (8-7) can clinch the division title by winning 
Saturday against the Jets. Buffalo holds the tiebreaker advantage in the 
division because it beat Miami twice and has a better AFC East record than 
Indianapolis. If the Bills lose, they can win the division title if 
Indianapolis and Miami both lose, or can be a wild card if Indianapolis, Kansas 
City, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Seattle and the Raiders all lose. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Dolphins (8-7) must win to reach the playoffs. They will win the 
division title if Buffalo and Indianapolis both lose. Miami can still be a wild 
card. 
</P>
<P>
The Indianapolis Colts (8-7) will clinch the division title if they win at New 
Orleans next week and Buffalo loses. They also clinch a wild card with a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TONIGHT'S GAME 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia at New Orleans, 6 p.m. -- The Eagles (10-4) can clinch a wild-card 
berth with a victory. The Saints (7-7), eliminated from contention for a 
playoff berth, are down to one goal: posting their third consecutive winning 
season. 
</P>
<P>
John Fourcade, who replaced the Bobby Hebert and passed for 302 yards in a 
victory over Buffalo last week, will start again for the Saints.

The Detroit Lions, behind the running of Barry Sanders and passing of Bob 
Gagliano, won their fourth consecutive game, beating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 
33-7, Sunday for Detroit's longest win streak since the start of the 1980 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, the NFC's leading rusher, ran for 104 yards and one touchdown in 21 
carries, giving him 1,312 yards and the Lions' club record for a rookie. Billy 
Sims, who set the former mark with 1,308 yards in 1980 and is now retired, 
rushed onto the field to congratulate Sanders after an 11-yard run with 6:34 
left in the third quarter that put him over the mark. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth 100-yard game for Sanders, who has rushed for more yardage 
than the entire Detroit team did a year ago. With one game remaining, he is 125 
yards shy of Sims' single-season club mark of 1,437 in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions (6-9) lost a bid for their first shutout in six years when Tampa 
Bay's Joe Ferguson and Mark Carrier hooked up for a 69-yard touchdown pass on 
the final play of the game. It was Detroit's first sweep of the Bucs (5-10) 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't good enough in any phase of the game," Tampa Bay Coach Ray Perkins 
said. "We got outcoached, outplayed and, if they had cheerleaders, we probably 
got outcheered." 
</P>
<P>
Gagliano, who has been the quarterback in all four games in the winning streak, 
completed 19 of 33 for 192 yards, including first-quarter touchdown passes of 
two yards to Richard Johnson and 55 to Jason Phillips. Sanders ran for a 
four-yard second-quarter touchdown and Eddie Murray kicked field goals of 33, 
43, 35 and 36 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucs' offensive line, which allowed only 22 sacks in the first 11 games, 
has yielded 17 in the last four weeks, including four by Detroit. The third 
sack, with 10:54 remaining in the second quarter, put Tampa Bay quarterback 
Vinny Testaverde out of the game with a sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson went the rest of the way, completing seven of 18 for 161 yards, with 
three of the Bucs' four interceptions. Carrier, who has eight 100-yard 
receiving games, including four of his last five, caught four passes for 131 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't execute," Carrier said. "We made a lot of mistakes. Every time we 
made a big play we didn't take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit took the opening kickoff and, with Sanders ripping off runs of 13 and 
34 yards, went 67 yards in six plays, with Gagliano hitting Johnson in front of 
Harry Hamilton for the score. 
</P>
<P>
On Tampa Bay's second possession, Jerry Holmes intercepted a Testaverde pass in 
front of Carrier at midfield. Three plays later, on a third-and-15, Gagliano 
found Phillips wide open behind blown coverage for a scoring play that put 
Detroit ahead 14-0 with 4:57 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With Gagliano passing for 25 yards and scrambling twice for 28, the Lions went 
53 yards in 12 plays on their next possession and Murray kicked a 33-yard field 
goal to cap the second-quarter drive.

CHUTIST DIES IN NIGHTTIME JUMP FROM OFFICE TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran sky diver was fatally injured early Sunday in what police said was an 
illegal parachute jump from atop a Century City high-rise office building. He 
slammed into the structure at least three times on his plunge. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the victim as Richard Allen Pedley Sr., 57, of Walnut. He was 
among a group of parachutists who jumped from the building at about 1:30 a.m., 
Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Pedley fell 12 to 15 stories before landing on another structure adjacent to 
the 40-story building, which was under construction at 1999 Avenue of the 
Stars, Police Sgt. Lee Bradford said. Pedley was flown to UCLA Medical Center, 
where he died later. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently three other parachutists made the jump successfully before Pedley's 
fatal jump, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Pedley's son, Richard Allen Pedley Jr., 22, also of Walnut, not one of the 
parachutists, was arrested by a security guard and booked at the West Los 
Angeles Division station for investigation of trespassing. He was released on 
his own recognizance, Lt. Lee Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was well known in sky diving circles, but had relatively little 
experience with the nuances of jumping from fixed objects. 
</P>
<P>
"Pedley had thousands of jumps from from aircraft," said Jean K. Boenish, 
executive Director of BASE, a base-jumping parachutists' group which -- unlike 
sky diving groups -- includes chutists who leap from fixed objects such as 
bridges, skyscrapers, antenna towers and towering earth formations. 
</P>
<P>
Boenish, 29, of Hawthorne, said that Pedley, although affiliated with her 
group, was "new to base jumping," with less than 10 jumps from fixed objects. 
</P>
<P>
Boenish said she was briefed Sunday on the fatal accident by individuals 
familiar with what occurred at the Century City site. Pedley's parachute, she 
said, "opened backwards," swinging the victim into the building, instead of 
away from it. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he hit it (the structure) at least three times," she said. "It was more 
than likely a packing error." 
</P>
<P>
The three other parachutists who preceded Pedley came to his aid and then 
called for medical help, she said. They were gone by the time police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Pedley's son, who could not be reached for comment, did not parachute off the 
building, Boenish said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known (the senior) Pedley for about 10 years," she said. "We used to jump 
together in Perris," a Riverside County community popular with sky divers. "He 
and I were in the same field of free-fall photography." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Boenish's husband, Carl, an internationally famous sky-diving 
photographer, successfully jumped off a 54-story building in downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, Carl Boenish was killed, at the age of 43, in a parachute 
jump from a 5,600-foot Norwegian peak. Two days after his fatal accident, his 
wife, Jean, scaled the same mountain and made a successful jump. 
</P>
<P>
Most jumps off buildings and other fixed structures generally go unreported in 
the media, Jean Boenish said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are about 100 a year in Los Angeles. They're done with frequency," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said it is a misdemeanor to jump from buildings in Los Angeles without a 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
People who jump from buildings, Boenish said, "try to keep as low a profile as 
possible. That's why it's usually done at night."

MONTOYA TRIAL BRINGS DISMAY TO DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: GLOOM DEEPENS IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY AS THE TESTIMONY CONTINUES. 
BUT THE STATE SENATOR IS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUPPORTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At Alice's Beauty Shop in the heart of La Puente's three-block downtown, there 
is talk of politics and disillusionment. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Alice Laughlin met Democratic state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya when they 
belonged to a Catholic youth organization about 30 years ago. She had all but 
forgotten him, but when he was running for the state Assembly in the early 
'70s, he came into her shop and greeted her by name. 
</P>
<P>
That impressed her, she recalled recently. She remembered thinking that he 
appeared to be a young man on his way up. 
</P>
<P>
But now, the local boy who made good is on trial in a Sacramento federal 
courthouse, facing 12 charges of extortion, racketeering, bribery and money 
laundering. Montoya has proclaimed his innocence. But virtually every day since 
the trial began Dec. 4, the prosecution has depicted him as a venal, 
money-obsessed politician who expected campaign contributions or speaking fees 
in exchange for his legislative support. Montoya offered "legislation with a 
price tag," one witness said; a prosecutor in the case claimed that the 
lawmaker relied on a "code green" staff notation on his calendar to remind him 
when he was scheduled to receive money. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear that kind of stuff so often about politicians," Laughlin said during 
a pause in business at her shop. "It's a shame that someone you knew would be 
part of a scandal." 
</P>
<P>
In Montoya's home district, which encompasses several working class cities in 
the San Gabriel Valley, the first reaction among many of those who have known 
and dealt with Montoya over the years has been to rally to the defense of their 
native son. Local officeholders, educators and Chamber of Commerce officials 
make a point of praising him as an effective legislator who has always watched 
out for their interests. In the past, they add, he served as a role model for 
Latinos who followed him into politics. 
</P>
<P>
But as his trial enters its third week, even some of those who consider 
themselves Montoya supporters say they are dismayed at the allegations being 
aired in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's going to come of this," said Jess Luera, a Norwalk-La 
Mirada school board member who said he has long admired Montoya's achievements 
and style. "I wish him well, but it doesn't look so good. Joe's worked hard. He 
moved up the ladder. Maybe he moved too quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, 50, is a product of the San Gabriel Valley, and of its politics, but 
especially of La Puente, a gritty town often overshadowed by the City of 
Industry, Whittier, El Monte and West Covina. La Puente has only 33,000 
inhabitants, although it has grown considerably since Montoya moved there with 
his parents at age 15. 
</P>
<P>
He graduated from La Puente High School in 1957. He was on the track and 
football teams, but otherwise did not distinguish himself, according to Robert 
Schilling, who was principal at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I don't remember much about him other than he was kind 
of a nice, outgoing little kid," Schilling said. "He was a runner. He wasn't 
one of these terrific standouts. He was just a nice little kid. 
</P>
<P>
"He's having a time now, isn't he?" Schilling added. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya served four years in the Air Force and then graduated from UCLA. Soon 
after, he began a long career in public service. At age 28, he became one of La 
Puente's youngest City Council members, and from 1971-72 served as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he lives only a stone's throw from the La Puente city limits, in a 
neighborhood called Avocado Hills, an unincorporated area of Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Ask people on the streets of his district about Montoya and many have only a 
superficial knowledge of his position and his current troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no. It's not the talk of the town," said La Puente Mayor Max Ragland, who 
has served on the City Council on and off since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the area is booming with a teeming immigrant population and myriad 
factories that provide its economic base and employ thousands of people. There 
are scores of recently built suburban tract homes. The town squares that once 
were the centers of activity -- and distinguished one community from the other 
-- were robbed years ago of much activity by modern shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
But the trial is the talk among those who knew Montoya and worked with him. 
</P>
<P>
At La Puente City Hall, some of the old-timers say they hope the trial goes 
Montoya's way. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally have no animosity against him, and I hope he's innocent -- or 
maybe I should say, I hope he can prove he's innocent," said Ruth Watson, 
assistant to the La Puente city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, he was honest and conscientious," Mayor Ragland said. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya also has defenders at the Chalet Basque, a restaurant in downtown La 
Puente that he used to frequent. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't pay attention to what they say up there (in Sacramento)," the Chalet's 
bartender, who would not give his name, said of the trial. "I don't believe 
that about the bribery either. I don't believe a lot of stuff in the paper. 
It's up to the courts to take care of it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are signs that the trial is eroding his popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the people that I've talked to and discussed this with . . . there are a 
lot of mixed feelings about this whole thing," said Isabel Gonthier, who serves 
on the Rio Hondo Community College Board of Trustees. "Many people feel that 
all people in state offices are often targets of their enemies. Then there are 
those who will say, 'The SOB is guilty.' 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us are taking a wait-and-see attitude," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who seem to be reflecting the most on Montoya's fate are the legions of 
Latino community leaders who have served on various boards or commissions 
throughout the San Gabriel Valley. Many of them feel beholden to Montoya for 
blazing the political trail at a time when there were few Latino elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe is gente," said Maria Avila, a long-time Montoya supporter from El Monte 
who is now president of the county's Commission on the Status of Women. "Joe's 
been supportive of his community. He looks out for us. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally get angry that he's been singled out for this," she said. "I 
think it's public knowledge that there are others that may have been involved 
in other things. They've decided to quit and that's that. But Joe's a fighter. 
He could have quit, but he didn't. That's the kind of person Joe is. Maybe 
that's why he's rubbed people the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
Luera, the Norwalk-La Mirada school board member, said he is saddened by the 
charges against Montoya, as are many of the Latino clients at the senior 
citizens' center where he works. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the seniors come to me and ask, 'Que pasa con Jose?' They want to be 
supportive, but they don't really know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Luera said that as the trial progresses, it will become more difficult for 
Montoya to get out from under the cloud of the scandal, even if he is 
acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
"When you throw mud at a wall, something is going to stick," he said. "The mark 
will remain. Joe, whether he's innocent or not, is going to live with this the 
rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Raul Ruiz, a Chicano studies professor at Cal State Northridge and longtime 
Chicano activist who knows Montoya, said Latino voters often have been too 
forgiving in their attitudes toward Latino politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe in the past we were not willing to hold someone up to a higher level of 
accountability because we were simply glad to have a Mexican in office," he 
said. "But (Latino politicians) have to realize that they must be more 
accountable, that they have to set an example, that there is absolutely no 
excuse for them.

NOISE IN VERNON CHURCH IS SIGN OF FAITH; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: HOLY ANGELS MARKS ITS FIRST ANNIVERSARY AS A CENTER OF WORSHIP FOR 
THE DEAF AND HEARING IMPAIRED. ITS SERVICES ARE NOT THE TRADITIONAL KIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A visitor's first impression of Holy Angels Church for the Deaf in Vernon is 
how loud it is. 
</P>
<P>
Babies bawl at the top of their lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Their older brothers and sisters talk freely to one another. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents don't hear them to control them," Debra Carey, a sign language 
interpreter, explained after 11 a.m. Mass Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Today marks the first anniversary of Holy Angels, which is the only Catholic 
church in the Los Angeles Archdiocese offering special services for the deaf 
and hearing impaired. 
</P>
<P>
Fathers Brian Doran and Tom Schweitzer, themselves hearing impaired, conduct 
all services, weddings and funerals in sign language. Even the Catholic 
confessions, traditionally heard in anonymity as a priest sits behind a 
curtain, are conducted in face-to-face sign language. 
</P>
<P>
Schweitzer, 34, said his deaf parishioners express no embarrassment at publicly 
professing their sins. 
</P>
<P>
"Deaf people are used to face-to-face communication," Schweitzer said Sunday as 
Mass was about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
According to church deacon James Dillon, Holy Angels was created last year in 
response to a request by the local deaf community that the Los Angeles 
Archdiocese establish a church specifically for the deaf and hearing impaired. 
Church officials say there are as many as 20,000 deaf and hearing-impaired 
people in the Los Angeles Archdiocese, which covers Los Angeles, Ventura and 
Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the deaf parishioners are able to read lips, they say it is 
difficult -- and sometimes impossible -- to do so in large churches. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to feel like I was missing something in Mass," David Rose, 28, of Santa 
Monica, said in sign language through an interpreter after services at Holy 
Angels. "Now, I understand more and more." 
</P>
<P>
Another of the church faithful, Gladys Study, 77, of Venice, said that she, 
too, was frustrated at sitting through Catholic services at other churches. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hear them (the priests), but I wouldn't understand what they were 
saying," said Study, who suffers from impaired hearing and can hear only the 
loudest noises through a hearing aid. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic Archdiocese selected as the home of its new deaf church the former 
Santa Marta Church, a 75-year-old stone chapel on Santa Fe Avenue in Vernon. It 
was closed almost a decade ago because of a dwindling congregation, Dillon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The church required nearly $300,000 in renovations, having been damaged in the 
6.0-magnitude earthquake that struck the Whittier area two years ago, Dillon 
said. Included in the renovation was repainting of the altar from white to 
purple. Dillon explained that the darker background color was needed to make it 
easier for the deaf parishioners to see a father's hand movements. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 18, 1988, opening of Holy Angels Church drew parishioners from as far 
as Hemet, San Diego and Orange. About 100 people began attending services there 
on a regular basis. Today, church officials estimate the congregation at 150 
and growing. 
</P>
<P>
Father Doran, however, does not want the church to outgrow its current small 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want it to get so big that people can't see," said Doran, 47, who was 
the first deaf Catholic priest ordained in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's 11 a.m. congregation filled the 125-seat church to overflowing. 
Fathers Doran and Schweitzer greeted the faithful with sign language. A 
fluttering of moving hands and fingers ensued as the congregation returned the 
greeting. 
</P>
<P>
Then, traditional Mass ensued in a most non-traditional manner. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the staid atmosphere that typically marks a Catholic Mass, this 
service resembled a television talk show. 
</P>
<P>
The fathers used candy, toys and balloons to emphasize points of a sermon. 
Several deaf parishioners jokingly covered their ears when a blue balloon was 
popped. 
</P>
<P>
Parishioners repeatedly chimed in their input. For example, Michael Bennett, 
35, of West Covina, frantically waved for attention and, when recognized, said 
in sign language: "I offer a prayer for the people who are not here because 
they are sick." 
</P>
<P>
The non-traditional church atmosphere is necessary, Dillon later explained, 
because deaf people communicate in an animated manner. 
</P>
<P>
Shaking hands with departing parishioners, Schweitzer said Holy Angels 
represents more to the deaf than a place for worship. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal of this church," he said, "is really to be a home for the deaf people 
-- a place where they belong."

'NATURAL GLUE' CLOSES INCISIONS, DOCTOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A clotting substance extracted from a patient's blood can be used as a natural 
glue to close some surgical incisions, and it eventually might offer a new way 
to stop bleeding during operations, a Los Angeles physician reports. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Journal of the American Medical Assn. last week, Dr. Mark A. 
Mandel said he had successfully used a spray of a patient's fibrinogen to 
replace most of the sutures that would have been needed to close the incisions 
of an eyelid lift. Fibrinogen is a blood component essential to blood clotting. 
</P>
<P>
This natural glue seals the incision and avoids the formation of cysts and 
lesions called granulomas at suture sites, said Mandel, who is in private 
practice in Century City. The extraction of the fibrinogen from a patient's own 
previously donated blood also avoids any transmission of disease, such as AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, where fibrinogen extracts are more widely used in surgery, he said, 
the fibrinogen is extracted from pooled blood donations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandel said fibrinogen sprays might also offer a new way to stem bleeding 
during certain surgeries or in emergency situations. Mandel plans to present 
the results at an American College of Surgeons meeting in Santa Barbara in 
January.

SYNTHETIC BLOOD PROTEIN REPORTED

<TEXT>
<P>
A major Japanese oil refining company says it has developed an artificial, 
contamination-free method of making the blood protein albumin. Masanori Suzuki, 
head of genetic engineering for the Tonen Corp., said in an interview Wednesday 
that the technique is the first to synthesize human albumin with an authentic 
cell structure. 
</P>
<P>
The protein, now commonly extracted from donated blood, is used to treat burn 
victims and people with albumin deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki said albumin taken from human blood is sometimes contaminated with the 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus or other disease-causing agents. 
Synthetic albumin, however, presents no risk of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Tonen aims for full-scale production in three to five years.

<P>
Taking aspirin early in pregnancy does not appear to increase the chances that 
a woman will give birth to a baby with a defective heart, researchers report in 
a finding contrary to previous studies. 
</P>
<P>
In the largest study of its kind, Boston University researchers failed to find 
any significant association between aspirin use and five types of potentially 
fatal heart birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, the researchers examined the aspirin use of 1,381 women who gave 
birth to babies with five types of heart defects and 6,966 women who gave birth 
to babies with other types of birth defects from 1976 through 1986 in Boston, 
Philadelphia, Iowa and Ontario, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers failed to find any significant association between aspirin use 
and the heart deformities overall, they reported in the New England Journal of 
Medicine.

<P>
Populations of frogs, toads and salamanders appear to be declining mysteriously 
in many places around the world, and scientists fear the dramatic disappearance 
of the amphibians may be a sign of widespread environmental degradation of some 
unknown kind. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, there have been rumors and scattered reports that frogs and 
toads appear to be far less common than they once were. More recently, many 
field biologists have begun documenting precipitous declines, sometimes 
measuring from 50% to 90%, and local extinctions in a variety of settings, from 
tropical forests to temperate mountain lakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned," said David Wake of UC Berkeley. "There seems to be 
something going on, something we don't yet understand." 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the decline remains a mystery. Some researchers suspect acid rain. 
But others believe the crashing populations could be caused by pesticides, 
viruses, hard winters or dry summers. In some locations, the frogs and other 
amphibians may have been wiped out by introduced competitors such as fish. The 
animals may also be exploited for food or even by scientists themselves, who 
collect specimens for research.

AT 96, FEUDING MATRIARCH OPENS NEW BUSINESS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tiny grandmother Rose Blumkin belongs alongside giants in the pantheon of 
entrepreneurial chutzpah. 
</P>
<P>
At age 96, Blumkin is starting over again in business. A legend among 
Midwestern shoppers, founder of what became the nation's largest single 
furniture store, the personification of the 20th Century immigrant experience 
and fulfillment of the American dream, she is not going back to work to acquire 
more wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need no more money," says the matriarch of a phenomenally successful 
family in her thick Russian-accented English. 
</P>
<P>
She's doing it for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Blumkin wants to get even with two of her grandsons, who she says forced her 
out as chairman of the Nebraska Furniture Mart, a $150-million-a-year furniture 
and carpeting empire she founded a half-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
It's a vendetta worthy of "Dallas" or "Dynasty," this Battle of the Blumkins 
that has been the talk of Omaha for months now. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish to live two more years and I'll show them who I am," said the feisty 
4-foot, 11-inch woman everybody calls Mrs. B. "I'll give them hell." 
</P>
<P>
"Them" are grandsons Ron and Irv Blumkin. "They told me I'm too old, too 
cranky," said Mrs. B. "I gave my life away for my family. I made them 
millionaires. I was chairman of the board and they took away from me my rights. 
I shouldn't be allowed to buy anything. No salesmen should talk to me. So I got 
mad and I walked out. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I lived too long. Maybe they're tired of me," she said of Ron and Irv. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever she says is fine," an unsmiling Ronald Blumkin said. He is 41 and 
president of the Nebraska Furniture Mart. "It makes a better story when you 
only hear one side." Irvin, 38, is vice president. He refused to meet with a 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Other family members, unwilling to be identified, support the version of the 
feud recited by Mrs. B, whose business philosophy is "sell cheap and never 
lie." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. B did not just walk out. She walked directly across Jones Street on the 
west side of Omaha where, three months ago, in a 360,000-square-foot building 
-- the size of a Midwestern cornfield -- she opened Mrs. B's Warehouse to 
compete with "my high-class grandsons . . . who only know fancy things and to 
always take vacations." (There is no room for vacations in Mrs. B's work 
ethic.) 
</P>
<P>
It is not exactly an even match. "They are the elephant. I am the ant," she 
recently told her granddaughter, Claudia Boehm, who is helping in the new 
venture. The grandsons' Nebraska Furniture Mart is well stocked with brand-name 
merchandise and a selection that meets the needs of everyone from college 
students in their first apartment to established business executives. 
</P>
<P>
Still, last month, with a relatively small inventory, with major manufacturers 
refusing to sell her merchandise and before she ran a single ad or officially 
opened, Mrs. B grossed $256,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a fast operator," said Mrs. B. "Thank God, I still got my brains, my 
know-how, my talent . . . but it's not so easy." 
</P>
<P>
Her grandsons have retaliated, she says, telling furniture and carpet 
manufacturers that if they sell to her the Blumkin boys will not carry their 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"All the national companies won't sell (to) me. It's a boycott," said Mrs. B. 
"And they are telling carpet layers that they shouldn't have nothing to do with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
"Suppliers have to make their own marketing decisions," said Ron Blumkin. "It's 
their decision to make." 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you're in the middle of internecine warfare it's difficult," said a 
salesman willing to deal with Mrs. B. "They made it plain they didn't want us 
to come over here. But she's terrific. She knows carpets better than anybody in 
the country. It's her specialty." 
</P>
<P>
Flattery did not help. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a time to be drunk and a time to be sober. Today I'm sober," Mrs. B 
said, sending the salesman on his way. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone that works lives long," said Mrs. B, who turned 96 last Friday and 
works 50 to 60 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
As she did for years at her other store, she races around her new sprawling 
warehouse in a three-wheeled electric golf cart looking more like a Jewish 
R2-D2 than the bubbee of 12 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren. She darts 
along the rows of reclining chairs and the stacks of carpeting alternately 
yelling at employees ("Dummy. Stupe. What do you know?") and charming customers 
("Honey, what are you looking for? Whatever you want, I'll give you a real 
bargain . . . the best deal.") 
</P>
<P>
"She is the 20th Century on three wheels," said Jerry Pearson, who sells 
furniture and carpeting at Mrs. B's and who believes the woman's life story 
reflects not only the immigrant experience but the energy that fueled America's 
entrepreneurial machine during much of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"For her, the ethos is the sale," said Pearson, whose job as a salesman belies 
his studies in business and economics. "Everything is the sale. It's her 
thrill. The sale has to be made. It's her kick." 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God I can multiply," said Mrs. B. "I can multiply quicker than any 
computer. . . . When a customer comes in, I tell them what to buy. I teach them 
economics." 
</P>
<P>
"I like the way she does business," said retired truck driver Edwin A. Oeltjen 
of Ames, Neb. "She'll tell you right up front what she'll do on price. There is 
no foolishness, no double talk." 
</P>
<P>
"I've dealt with her for 30 years," said Judd Gillespie, an Omaha businessman. 
"She was always the final authority on every carpet sale at the Nebraska 
Furniture Mart. The salesman made the sale, but she closed it." 
</P>
<P>
Business has been Rose Gorelick Blumkin's life since she was a teen-ager in a 
village near Minsk in Russia. Her father, a rabbi, "was too religious to make a 
living." Her mother supported the family selling groceries. At 13, Rose went to 
work in a dry-goods store to help the family. At 16, she was the manager with 
six employees working for her. She fled Russia in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the Russian guard (on the Siberian-Chinese border) that I was going to 
buy leather for the army and that I would bring for him a big bottle of vodka. 
He's still waiting," said Mrs. B. 
</P>
<P>
With little money, she made her way through China and Japan, eventually getting 
passage to Seattle on a peanut boat. Rose joined her late husband, Isadore, who 
had settled in Ft. Dodge, Iowa. They soon moved to Omaha because it was the 
closest place where Rose could speak Russian and Yiddish, her only languages 
until she learned English from her oldest daughter, Frances, who was learning 
it in kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
The Blumkins bought and resold used clothing. Rose went into the furniture 
business in the basement of her husband's store in 1937. In a short time, 
furniture became the main business and Mrs. B the family's main business 
person, building the Nebraska Furniture Mart into the country's biggest single 
furniture outlet. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a talent. I had ambition," said Mrs. B. Last year the Furniture Mart had 
sales of $152 million. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Mrs. B sold the Furniture Mart for $60 million to millionaire investor 
Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway, 
which holds major interests in companies ranging from See's Candy Shops to 
Capital Cities/ABC. The Blumkins retained 20% ownership in the business. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. B does not approve of what big business did to her big business. 
</P>
<P>
"Now there are too many executives, too many meetings, too many vacations, and 
all that is costing them money," Mrs. B said. "I told Buffett when I ran it 
expenses were $7 million. Now they are $27 million. Now every stupe is a 
president, a vice president." 
</P>
<P>
"The tragedy is that when they kicked her out it was like a death sentence," 
said Pearson. "She's a workaholic."

UCLA PLAN CLOUDS FUTURE OF 107-YEAR-OLD LAB SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In post-World War II Los Angeles, with a Japanese-American mother and a white 
father, Heidi Brandt grew up with prejudice and cultural conflict. Deed 
restrictions kept her family from living north of Santa Monica Boulevard. There 
were the emotional scars of her mother's internment and constant reminders that 
the girl was "not accepted in either community." 
</P>
<P>
All that faded when Brandt stepped onto the UCLA campus grounds of the Corinne 
A. Seeds University Elementary School. With its emphasis on respecting 
individual differences, the experimental research school for the Graduate 
School of Education "made me feel safe and cherished," Brandt recalled. "I 
truly believe I had the perfect education . . . in a tremendously rich, 
positive environment." 
</P>
<P>
Today Brandt, who sends her 8-year-old daughter to Seeds, belongs to a group of 
parents, alumni and school officials who are fighting UCLA over a plan that 
they say will destroy California's only remaining "laboratory" school. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly pressed for space, UCLA officials are considering giving the 
internationally renowned facility, now spread over nine idyllic acres, to the 
Santa Monica/Malibu Unified School District, where it would be staffed and run 
by the university under a long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA proposal comes at a time when many around the country -- from 
President Bush and corporate leaders to parents and educators -- are trying to 
find ways to get better results from America's schools. The debate over the 
107-year-old school's future raises the issue of whether the best way to train 
teachers and conduct educational research is in the rarefied atmosphere of a 
university campus, or in the "real world" of public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Some take the Santa Monica proposal as a signal that UCLA cares more about 
other disciplines than it does about improving the education of the nation's 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"If that were connected with the medical school or law school instead of the 
school of education, they would not dream of moving it off campus," said UC 
Berkeley education professor James W. Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, do not see the need for lab schools. Stanford University, for 
example, works closely with Bay Area schools to come up with ways to improve 
education. "The university is not the fount of all knowledge," said Beverly 
Carter, director of the Stanford/Schools Collaborative. "What we're doing is 
being fashioned with a lot more input from the teachers and administrators in 
the public schools." 
</P>
<P>
Lab schools, founded at the turn of the century by followers of philosopher 
John Dewey, flourished for years -- conducting research, training teachers and 
experimenting with new teaching techniques and curricula. 
</P>
<P>
Most were gone by the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't doing their job, and the benefit (of having a lab school) was not 
outweighing the financial burden," said George Barker, an associate professor 
of elementary education at Cal State Northridge and a former member of the 
Seeds faculty. Unlike the Seeds school, most "stopped taking on roles of 
innovation and research and became country clubs for professors' children," 
Barker added. 
</P>
<P>
Now lab schools are enjoying a resurgence. Across the country, there are about 
100 institutions that consider themselves laboratory schools, according to Mina 
Bayne, professor of education at the University of Wyoming and president-elect 
of the National Assn. of Laboratory Schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing that linkage with the university is very important, in part 
because it protects us from having to please school boards and parents," said 
Wendall McConnaha, principal of the University High School, associated with the 
University of Chicago and considered the granddaddy of laboratory schools. 
</P>
<P>
Almost from its beginning, UCLA's Seeds school, which takes its name from a 
noted education reform pioneer, has enjoyed the freedom to experiment with 
teaching techniques and philosophies. Unfettered by state education 
requirements and sheltered from the political vagaries of a local school board, 
it attracts innovative teachers who have been designing programs copied widely. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a neat little school that has influence far beyond its 450 kids," said 
Adrianne Bank, associate director of the Seeds school. 
</P>
<P>
Students, chosen to reflect the racial and socioeconomic makeup of the U.S. 
school-age population, get state-of-the-art educations in exchange for becoming 
guinea pigs. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens here affects children everywhere," Brandt, a lawyer and president 
of the Family School Alliance -- Seeds' version of the PTA -- told a school 
gathering one evening. "As lab school parents you have given the gift of your 
child to children everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
After announcing plans more than a year ago to build a new graduate school of 
management on part of Seeds' tree-dotted grounds, university officials began 
talks with the Santa Monica district. The preliminary proposal calls for UCLA 
to build a campus on parkland in the ethnically and economically diverse Ocean 
Park section of the city. The university, which hopes to draw most of the new 
school's students from the surrounding neighborhood, would have authority to 
staff and run the school and conduct research programs. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the talks drew immediate anger and skepticism from Seeds parents and 
alumni, some of whom are veterans of other crises that have periodically dogged 
the sometimes-controversial school. The parents' group began pushing university 
officials to consider other options, especially leaving the school on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"Practically speaking, it just couldn't be the same," said Seeds parent Kathy 
Seal, who lives near the site proposed for the move but would gladly give up 
convenience to keep the school at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"A school like this has got to be free of all outside influences. UCLA has not 
been able to guarantee to us that the new school would not fall prey to the 
political pressures that are a fact of life in a public school system," Seal 
said, adding it infuriates her that the university is tampering with "a school 
that works." 
</P>
<P>
The school was founded in 1882 for teacher training, affiliated with the 
university in 1919 and moved onto campus in 1947. Its low-slung, wide-windowed 
buildings include several by architect Richard Neutra (three of which will be 
torn down for the management school building). 
</P>
<P>
Grounded in the methods of the progressive movement, the school disdains tests 
and traditional textbooks. Report cards are eschewed in favor of detailed 
evaluations and frequent parent conferences. 
</P>
<P>
The school's 4- through 12-year-old students are not grouped by traditional 
grade levels. Classes are team-taught by faculty members who are given generous 
blocks of time to write their own curriculum. University students and visitors 
are often on campus conducting studies, trying out new ideas or merely 
observing. For their young subjects there are concerts at Royce Hall, visits to 
laboratories and scores of other advantages that come with being part of a 
major university campus. 
</P>
<P>
The roughly $1 million the University of California pays to run the school is 
supplemented with tuition of $1,700 a year (although about one-third of the 
students are on full or partial scholarships). The school strives for a mix of 
ability levels, ethnicity and income levels, but there are not enough places 
for all applicants. Siblings of current students get preference, and the 
chancellor gets a number of slots to designate as he sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the children of movie stars, politicians and other prominent 
people can often be found on the school's roster. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman, whose two daughters 
spent all their elementary school years at Seeds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they both got a great background and education and a love for learning 
there," said Edelman, who wrote to Chancellor Charles E. Young because he fears 
Seeds would lose "a lot of its uniqueness and sensitivity" if it becomes part 
of a public school system. 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis C. Solmon, dean of the Graduate School of Education, believes the 
"rarefied atmosphere" at the Seeds school may inhibit, rather than help, its 
research and demonstration function. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it is representative of the nation's (population distribution), it is 
not a public school, and it is not a community school," Solmon said. "It is in 
many ways atypical of the circumstances found in most public schools today, and 
therefore its student population is of limited interest to most of those doing 
research today." 
</P>
<P>
Solmon acknowledges that Seeds is indeed "a wonderful school . . . but that is 
not the issue." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not in the business of running schools. This is a laboratory school; 
its purpose is to conduct research, develop educational policy . . . and it 
doesn't do a good job of that now." 
</P>
<P>
Solmon said he finds the Santa Monica move "an interesting possibility" -- if 
ways can be found to guarantee the school's autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
His faculty, however, was asked its opinion on six options, including a move to 
Santa Monica, and keeping Seeds on campus but adding research or other Graduate 
School of Education facilities to the site. A majority of faculty members chose 
the latter; the Santa Monica proposal came in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Young will make the decision on the move, probably early next year. 
He has made it clear he believes the move to Santa Monica may be the best way 
of ensuring the school's future. 
</P>
<P>
Although he acknowledged Seeds facilities can be redesigned and even expanded 
-- for about $3 million to $4 million -- to allow it to share the site with the 
new management school, "the likelihood of its being there by the year 2000 is 
minimal," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether I make a decision to move the school or not, one of my successors is 
going to be put in the position where he will find it no longer possible to 
maintain that much land on this land-short campus," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Young added that the elementary school might "better serve its function by 
having an intimate relationship with a school system (that operates in) the 
real world rather than in an academic setting." The chancellor sent his 
children to Seeds, and three of his granddaughters are students there now, 
while his daughter is active in the parents' group that is trying to keep the 
school on campus. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that entering into such a relationship with a public school system 
would require the state's blessing, a willingness on the part of the Santa 
Monica school board to give up control over one of its schools for at least two 
decades and a contract that would ensure the laboratory school has the autonomy 
it needs to try new methods. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether all that is possible. I'd say the chances are probably 
about 50-50 now in either direction," 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has hired an attorney to help determine whether "to really take a shot at" 
moving the school to Santa Monica, Young said. It has also begun making plans 
to keep the school on campus and add at least research facilities if the public 
school plans don't work out. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica district Supt. Eugene Tucker, whose three grown children are Seeds 
alumni, said his school board is excited about the "opportunities that would be 
available to our youngsters and teachers" under a partnership with UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The district is waiting for UCLA's decision before holding formal hearings and 
a school board vote. "First the university needs to decide whether it is in its 
best interest to move the school, then we decide whether it is in our best 
interest to take it," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he sees "no significant issues" that could not be resolved and 
added he wants to work together with the present Seeds parents "to make it the 
best school we can." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, parents of Seeds students draw inspiration from the school's 
longtime pattern of beating adversity. 
</P>
<P>
Heidi Brandt has been digging in the UCLA archives, trying to glean guidance 
for the present battle from records of past skirmishes. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, the school weathered criticism when its students sent 
materials to Japanese-American children interned in relocation camps. A few 
years later it beat back attempts to change its progressive program. And in 
1969 and 1970, when the state tried to eliminate funding for the school, 
parents and alumni inundated legislators with telephone calls, telegrams and 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt recently found a 1970 letter that read in part: 
</P>
<P>
"For God's sake, let us preserve the treasure we now have, which is unique. It 
has been called the finest school in the United States. It must be allowed to 
remain. Without experimentation there can be no change."

FEDERAL JUDGES WARNED ABOUT POSTAL BOMBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

MOUNTAIN BROOK, Ala. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Marshals Service on Sunday warned federal judges throughout the nation 
to be on their guard in opening mail and packages after a package bomb killed 
federal appeals court Judge Robert S. Vance and seriously injured his wife, 
Helen. 
</P>
<P>
FBI Director William S. Sessions immediately dispatched technicians from the 
bureau's laboratory to assist in the investigation of Saturday's bombing at 
Vance's home in this affluent Birmingham suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday, the area around Vance's white-columned, two-story brick home was 
cordoned off, guarded by a single police cruiser, and a half-dozen vehicles 
belonging to federal and local investigators were parked in the driveway. 
Residents of the quiet neighborhood were stunned, and expressions of shock and 
sympathy poured into the community. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here, FBI officials said they and postal officials had 
questioned Vance's wife, who remains hospitalized in serious but stable 
condition. She "has provided information that will be helpful," said Allen P. 
Whitaker, FBI special agent in charge. He refused to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
FBI Special Agent Tom Moore described her as "coherent and helpful." He added 
that she had telephoned a neighbor after the explosion, which occurred at 2:51 
p.m. Saturday, and was outside the house in her van when paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
She had been in the house when the bomb exploded in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The device was far too powerful to be a letter bomb, Moore said. "You can 
deduce from the force and thrust" that it was much larger, he said, adding that 
it had seriously injured Helen Vance even though she was in another room. 
Authorities believe the package bomb was delivered by the regular mail carrier, 
Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about security for other federal judges, Moore said: "They have been 
warned." He would not say if any were under guard. One federal judge in 
Birmingham, giving interviews to the news media, did not appear to be 
accompanied by security personnel. 
</P>
<P>
While there was speculation that Vance's murder may be linked to the heavy 
volume of drug cases handled by the 11th judicial circuit on which he served, 
an official involved in the probe termed it "very unusual" for an appellate 
judge to be attacked because he is fairly remote from defendants, compared with 
trial judges. 
</P>
<P>
However, Moore said that Vance, 58, "does handle many drug cases," adding that 
possible retaliation against him is among other possibilities that 
investigators are probing. 
</P>
<P>
If Vance's killing did turn out to be drug-related, it would be particularly 
ominous because of the possibility that the Colombian drug cartels' war on 
judges had spread to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Vance, a moderate named to the bench in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter, 
died instantly Saturday when the package, said by one source to be a "nail 
bomb," exploded. 
</P>
<P>
The warning to judges reiterated cautionary advice the marshals have given to 
jurists in the past, a marshals official said. Vance was under no special 
protection by the marshals and had received no threats, he added. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the FBI, Marshals and Postal Service, the federal Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local police and sheriff's deputies are 
taking part in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Vance was only the third federal judge to be killed this century. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Richard Daronco was shot to death at his home in May, 1988, 
by a former New York City police officer unhappy over the judge's dismissal of 
a sex discrimination suit filed by the ex-policeman's daughter. Charles Koster, 
the former officer, killed himself after shooting Daronco. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, U.S. District Judge John H. Wood Jr. was killed by a sniper outside 
his San Antonio home. FBI Director Sessions, then a federal judge in Texas, 
presided over the trial of Charles V. Harrelson, who was convicted of the 
drug-related contract killing and is serving two life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, there was an attempt to kill Chief U.S. District Judge Paul Benson 
with a pipe bomb in Fargo, N. D., but a law clerk became suspicious about the 
package containing the bomb and it was successfully deactivated. The bomb 
appeared similar to one that exploded two days earlier at a nearby post office, 
injuring four workers. 
</P>
<P>
The Benson case has not been solved. 
</P>
<P>
In the Vance neighborhood, where Christmas decorations adorn huge homes and 
roadside mailboxes, residents expressed outrage at the killing and praise for 
Vance. 
</P>
<P>
"He was extremely well thought of," said Mary Dean Gray, who lives around the 
corner. "You don't hear about things like this in Mountain Brook. Maybe in New 
York, Philadelphia or L.A., but not Mountain Brook." 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," said her husband, Jim Gray. Both said many here 
believe the bombing was connected with drug cases the judge had handled. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Lindstrom, who lives two houses away from the Vance home, called the 
bombing shocking. Vance, he said, was "just a nice guy." 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood lots are spacious, filled with trees, giving residents privacy and 
isolation. Lindstrom said he knew nothing about the bombing until he heard 
sirens at about 3:30. 
</P>
<P>
Vance and his wife raised show dogs, and several were said to be on the 
spacious grounds surrounding his home when the bomb exploded. The judge often 
was at home Saturdays, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, several colleagues and friends praised Vance's dedication to the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very bright and very committed," said Charles Morgan Jr., a college 
classmate who practiced law in Birmingham in the 1960s. "I had great respect 
for his skills." 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh and Sessions, who had just returned from meetings in 
Europe on counterterrorism, expressed outrage over Vance's killing in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said acts such as the bombing "are at odds with the underlying 
belief of our nation and the rule of law." 
</P>
<P>
Sessions described the attack as "an affront to the very strength of our 
democratic society, our justice system." 
</P>
<P>
Vance, who served as a congressional page as a teen-ager and later became 
student body president of the University of Alabama, was chairman of the 
Alabama Democratic Party from 1966 to 1977. 
</P>
<P>
As a loyalist of the national Democratic Party during the presidency of Lyndon 
B. Johnson, Vance was often at odds with former Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace, 
who sought repeatedly but unsuccessfully to purge him from the party 
leadership. Vance was a moderate, while Wallace fought for segregation and 
states' rights. 
</P>
<P>
There was "never a time when Bob was on the side of the basest elements of 
Alabama," Morgan said. 
</P>

U.S. OFFICER, WIFE BEATEN IN PANAMA; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY ALERT: BUSH REVIEWS OPTIONS FOR ACTION IN WAKE OF FATAL SHOOTING. 
CHENEY ACCUSES NORIEGA OF FOSTERING VIOLENCE.

<P>
A U.S. Navy lieutenant was beaten and his wife was roughed up and sexually 
threatened by Panamanian soldiers late Saturday after they witnessed the fatal 
shooting of another American military officer in Panama City, Administration 
officials disclosed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The violence prompted President Bush and other Administration officials to 
quickly review a variety of possible actions by the United States to protect 
American lives in Panama against further provocations by the forces of 
Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the President received frequent briefings on the situation in 
Panama, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney huddled with his advisers at the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces in Panama were placed on alert to guard against further hostile 
actions by the Panamanian military, but there was no indication that Bush was 
considering military retaliation. Bush was harshly criticized in October for 
failing to assist in a failed coup attempt against Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney blamed Noriega for the slaying of the American officer and called for 
all of those responsible to be brought to justice. He issued a statement after 
his Pentagon meetings saying that the Panamanian leader's brutality against his 
own people had "created an atmosphere in which Panamanian Defense Forces feel 
free to fire on unarmed Americans." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting came closely on the heels of a declaration Friday by Noriega's 
rubber-stamp legislature that Panama is "in a state of war" with the United 
States, but it did not appear to U.S. policy-makers that the killers were 
acting under orders. Administration officials instead characterized the 
incident as part of a steady escalation in the harassment of Americans in 
Panama over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely concerned that a climate of aggression has developed that 
puts American lives at risk," said State Department spokeswoman Margaret 
Tutwiler. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the fatal shooting victim was being withheld pending 
notification of the next of kin. The Pentagon did not identify the others 
involved, either. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Sunday night, Pentagon officials said the victim and 
three other American military officers were fired upon as they drove away from 
a confrontation with soldiers at a checkpoint near the headquarters of 
Noriega's Panama Defense Forces. A second officer was "grazed," it said. 
</P>
<P>
After witnessing the shooting, an unidentified U.S. Navy lieutenant and his 
wife were detained for four hours by Panamanian soldiers, according to the 
Pentagon. Officials said that the officer was "repeatedly beaten and kicked in 
the groin and head" and threatened with death if he did not disclose the nature 
of his duties in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
While her husband was being interrogated, officials said, the officer's wife 
was harassed and "sexually threatened" by Panamanian soldiers. 
</P>

"His wife was slammed against a wall with such force that her head was cut," 
the Pentagon said. "After standing at the wall for half an hour with her arms 
above her head, she collapsed onto the floor." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials strongly denied a statement issued by the Panama Defense Forces 
on Sunday claiming that the American servicemen had fired on a crowd at a 
checkpoint, wounding a Defense Forces soldier and two civilians -- including a 
1-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
"That is bull," declared Mercedes Morris, spokeswoman for the U.S. Southern 
Command headquartered in Panama. "The U.S. forces were not armed. They did not 
shoot into the crowd. My own guess is that one of their (the Panamanians') 
bullets hit the civilians." 
</P>
<P>
The four men, dressed in civilian clothes, were driving to a popular downtown 
Panama City restaurant Saturday night when they made a wrong turn and were 
halted by soldiers at the checkpoint. According to the Pentagon, a crowd of 
five soldiers and about 40 bystanders swarmed the Americans' car when it 
arrived at the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The men received no answer when they inquired in Spanish why they were not 
being permitted to pass through the checkpoint, according to the Pentagon. 
Instead, the soldiers' rifles were loaded and aimed at the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
When the Panamanian soldiers grabbed at the Americans through the windows of 
their car and bystanders started chanting anti-American slogans, according to 
U.S. officials, the U.S. military officers "felt they were in a threatening 
situation" and drove off. 
</P>
<P>
The checkpoint guards responded by firing their Soviet-made AK-47s directly at 
the passengers in the fleeing vehicle, not at their tires, officials said. The 
Americans drove directly to nearby Gorgas Hospital, a U.S. Defense Department 
facility, where the victim died about 15 minutes after being admitted for 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy lieutenant and his wife witnessed the shooting because their car had 
been halted at the same checkpoint shortly before the four American soldiers 
arrived. The couple had become lost while driving home from a restaurant, 
according to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
They were immediately taken to a nearby Defense Forces office, blindfolded with 
masking tape and driven to another location for interrogation, according to the 
Pentagon. Officials said the lieutenant believed the questioning took place at 
Defense Forces headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
After the interrogation and beating ended, the couple were released about three 
blocks away from PDF headquarters. Officials said they arrived about 2:15 a.m. 
at the naval security office, where they told their story. 
</P>
<P>
It was apparently the bloodiest confrontation between the two nations since 
Jan. 9, 1964, when U.S. police and soldiers clashed with Panamanian rioters in 
the old Panama Canal Zone. Four U.S. soldiers and 22 Panamanians died in that 
clash. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, in a telephone interview from Panama City, attributed the shooting to 
escalating anti-American rhetoric by government forces in Panama, which she 
characterized as "an attempt to distract focus away from the fact that Gen. 
Noriega is a dictator, and a bloody one." 
</P>
<P>
A top State Department official, who declined to be identified, said it is 
unlikely the killers were acting under orders since the checkpoint 
confrontation occurred without warning. Likewise, he said, subsequent 
detention, beating and harassment of the American bystanders was probably not a 
premeditated act on the part of the Panama Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, American officials were taking strict precautions against further 
loss of American life in Panama. U.S. soldiers dressed in battle fatigues were 
mobilized along the perimeters of American installations a few miles northwest 
of Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, all 12,000 American military personnel in Panama were placed under 
a so-called Delta curfew, which requires them to postpone all unnecessary 
travel and confine their movements in Panama to restricted routes heavily 
guarded by U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
Another 40,000 Americans also live in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The curfew added to a feeling of tension in the city on Sunday, according to 
military officials. There were no golfers on the links at Ft. Amador, a 
military base shared by U.S. and Panamanian military units, and a popular 
picnic ground near the base was also virtually deserted. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increased tension brought on by the shooting, there were no 
reported incidents of renewed violence Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials refused to discuss what options were being considered for U.S. 
action or whether the President had considered a military response. But there 
was no sense of urgency in the statements made by Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is being intensely watched, and the President will continue to 
review status reports and briefings in the days ahead," said one State 
Department official. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk issued a statement accusing Noriega of 
using "force and intimidation" to thwart the will of the Panamanian people. "We 
deplore this act of violence," he said. "We are presently looking into the 
circumstances of this incident." 
</P>
<P>
Tensions between the armed forces of the two governments already were high as a 
result of the United States' long support for the overthrow of Noriega. Since 
October, the United States has been reviewing its legal options for direct 
action against Noriega, who is under indictment on drug charges in the United 
States.

Brooke Ward, the young leukemia patient who received a bone marrow transplant 
two years ago, died in her father's arms while on the way to a hospital, 
authorities said. She was 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery on Dec. 16, 1987, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in 
Seattle, was the first such transplant for which a donor was found through the 
National Bone Marrow Donor Registry. 
</P>
<P>
The little girl's widely publicized struggle brought recognition to the 
registry, and its list of donor names increased from 23,000 to 40,000. Her 
doctor said her death Saturday was caused by graft-versus-host disease, a 
condition in which the body rejects transplanted tissue. 
</P>
<P>
"They were really encouraged with Brooke since she had made it two years and 
had not relapsed," said the child's mother, Marguerite Ward. "It looked like 
just a matter of time and her body would accept the bone marrow." 
</P>
<P>
After a restless night, the girl's father, Michael Ward, took her to the 
hospital but she died en route.

The United States has started talks with Poland and Hungary on preventing 
diversion of U.S. high-technology exports to the Soviet Union, Commerce 
Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher's remarks came a day after President Bush signaled that his 
Administration is ready to consider relaxing of export controls involving 
Warsaw Pact nations. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher, appearing on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" program, was asked about a 
pending request by the Control Data Corp. to sell several high-powered 
computers to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
He responded that "we'll have to look at each item on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
"We released middle technology, and we're going to look to see whether it 
should go higher than that," Mosbacher said. "Eastern European countries, yes; 
the Soviet Union, we'd have to be very careful."

POLICE, DEMONSTRATORS CLASH IN ROMANIA;

EAST BLOC: ANGER OVER PLANS TO DEPORT A CLERGYMAN EXPLODES INTO A RARE PROTEST

Romanian security forces with tanks and water cannons battled thousands of 
anti-government demonstrators after police tried to deport a dissident 
clergyman, the Hungarian news agency and other sources reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It was believed to be one of the largest outbreaks of anti-government 
demonstrations in at least two years in Romania, where hard-line Communist 
leaders have crushed dissent and rejected the reforms under way elsewhere in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian state news agency, MTI, monitored in Vienna, quoted a local 
Hungarian television reporter in Szeged as saying an eviction order against the 
Rev. Laszlo Toekes of the Reformed Church in Timisoara was to be carried out 
Sunday afternoon. Timisoara is in western Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Other sources, however, said the authorities had intended to deport the 
minister Saturday. Toekes' fate was not known, MTI said. 
</P>
<P>
MTI said Toekes and his family had been guarded for several days by hundreds of 
ethnic Hungarians and other Romanian citizens. Toekes has championed ethnic 
Hungarian rights. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried to prevent the eviction of their clergyman, when hell broke loose 
and the human chain changed into a demonstration of thousands against 
(President Nicolae) Ceausescu and his regime," MTI reported, citing eyewitness 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"Riot police tried to suppress the demonstration, and a bloody brawl started," 
the Hungarian report said. "It took almost two hours for the policemen to gain 
the upper hand." 
</P>
<P>
The report did not say when the violence broke out, but other sources reported 
protests both Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
MTI, quoting the television reporter in Szeged, said eyewitnesses saw bloodied 
young people in the streets of Timisoara and that many of the demonstrators 
were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
However, no number was given for those arrested, and there was no immediate 
injury total. The Romanian state news agency did not report on the 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
MTI, quoting travelers returning from Romania, said police used water cannons 
against the demonstrators. A Czechoslovak citizen was quoted as saying he had 
seen tanks and blockaded streets. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a source at Hungarian television in Budapest told Associated Press 
that at least 10,000 Romanians had demonstrated Sunday against Ceausescu's 
authoritarian rule in Timisoara, about 30 miles from the Romanian border. 
</P>
<P>
The last major demonstration in Romania was believed to have been in November, 
1987, when thousands in Brasov protested Ceausescu's hard-line rule.

AQUINO ORDERS IMMEDIATE TRIAL FOR COUP PLOT LEADERS

<P>
Philippine President Corazon Aquino on Sunday ordered the immediate trial of 
leaders of this month's failed coup, branding them traitors who were paid "30 
pieces of silver" to bring her down. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino, speaking on a pre-recorded radio program, urged civilians to come 
forward with information that could help prosecute leaders of the Dec. 1-7 army 
revolt, in which more than 100 people were killed and nearly 600 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I order Gen. (Renato) de Villa to immediately investigate their top leaders," 
she said. "I also order military courts to hold a continuous trial, and I ask 
the people to attend the proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
De Villa, the country's armed forces chief, said the military has captured 
1,800 of about 3,000 mutineers who took part in the coup attempt, the sixth and 
bloodiest since Aquino came to power in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino vowed to show no mercy to the mutineers' leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did the rebel troops do that contemptible act? They did it . . . for 30 
pieces of silver," she said. "For the leaders of these rebel troops . . . our 
policy is to show them no mercy." 
</P>
<P>
Aquino did not say who paid the coup leaders. The military has said unnamed 
financiers paid some of the rebel officers $1.3 million to mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
The president said the coup attempt was backed by politicians who "knew they 
had no chance in an election." She did not identify them, but last week she 
hinted that her estranged vice president, Salvador Laurel, and Sen. Juan Ponce 
Enrile, a former defense chief, were involved. Both have denied any 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Government troops moved into position around Manila and the southern city of 
Davao during the weekend to stop possible new attacks by army rebels. But De 
Villa ruled out the likelihood of a major new attack by the rebels, believed to 
be led by cashiered Col. Gregorio (Gringo) Honasan. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is still any group planning to do this, I am warning them -- the 
armed forces will be there to confront them and stop them and crush them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
De Villa said the military, on full alert in Manila, has strengthened its 
forces around the capital and will maintain its combat readiness throughout 
Christmas if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The general appealed to troops to support the government, saying army 
"adventurists" seeking to grab power would only deliver the country to 
communism. 
</P>
<P>
"If the armed forces is destroyed by these few misguided elements . . . the 
nation will be pitiful because then the Communists will take over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, De Villa ordered commanders to speed up a proposed consolidation of 
the armed forces to prevent "further misadventure from misguided elements."

IRAN MODERATES SCORE GAINS BUT HARD-LINER IS REELECTED

Moderates scored gains over the weekend in Iranian elections seen as the first 
test of popular support for reformist President Hashemi Rafsanjani in his 
campaign to overhaul the economy. 
</P>
<P>
To the delight of the radicals, however, fiercely anti-Western Ali Akbar 
Mohtashemi, a middle-ranking cleric, was returned to Parliament for one of 
Tehran's four seats, winning a valuable platform for his militant stance on 
both foreign and domestic issues. But Mohtashemi's victory appeared to be an 
isolated one. The election results suggested that support is waning for the 
radical camp opposed to the market economy pursued by Rafsanjani's government. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-liners won a majority in the general elections of June, 1988, and have 
dominated the 270-seat Majlis. 
</P>
<P>
Mohtashemi's election did mark a comeback for the 43-year-old Islamic 
fundamentalist. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's so-called pragmatists, dumped Mohtashemi and 
other hard-liners in August, when he formed a Cabinet dominated by technocrats 
designed to revitalize Iran's economy after last year's cease-fire in the war 
with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Mohtashemi is allied with Ahmed Khomeini, son of the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini, the late revolutionary leader. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 64 candidates ran for nine seats in Friday's by-elections. The four 
winners in the provinces were relatively unknown figures.

SANTA CLAUS GOES OFF THE DEEP END IN DIVING TRADITION

SANTA CATALINA ISLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Keyes met Santa Claus this week -- on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
But when the 28-year-old Anaheim diver swam up to claim her Christmas present, 
Santa didn't give her anything from his soggy bag of goodies. 
</P>
<P>
"He said my hands were too full," Keyes, a computer instructor, lamented 
afterward. "I had a camera in one hand and I was trying to take pictures of 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Keyes was participating in one of Southern California's more unusual Yuletide 
celebrations. She accompanied a diving expedition of 24 people Saturday who 
erected a Christmas tree and received gifts from a diving Santa in the chilly 
waters off Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Santa Claus Dive has been an annual ritual of the Los Angeles 
chapter of the Underwater Photographic Society for much of the chapter's 
32-year history. The little-known tradition is also observed by a handful of 
other Southland scuba clubs and shops. 
</P>
<P>
"To us it's pretty normal, but every time we tell someone else they think it's 
abnormal," said Mark Dell'Aquila, 27, of Manhattan Beach, president of the 
underwater club's local chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a nice, calm way to celebrate Christmas, unlike going to the 
malls," added Susan Hamusek, 45, a first-time Christmas diver from Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
Embarking from San Pedro in the 78-foot dive boat Charisma, veterans of past 
Christmas dives swapped stories. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we were pushing the Christmas tree through the kelp beds and people 
passing in other dive boats just looked at us like 'What are you doing?' " said 
Mary Wicksten, a marine biology professor who travels for the dives from her 
home in Texas. "But that was nothing compared to the way the fish were looking 
at the tree. Apparently, the fish thought we were crazy too." 
</P>
<P>
With the Charisma anchored in 30 feet of aquamarine water in the Isthmus Cove 
off northeastern Catalina, the divers assembled a collapsible tree, lowered it 
into the sea and swam it in place on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Dell'Aquila suited up as Santa Claus, strapping on a beard and squeezing a 
Santa costume over his diving suit. Then he held his nose and jumped 
boots-first into the 60-degree water.

Perched underwater next to the tree, he handed out gifts -- liquor bottles 
wrapped in foil, for the most part -- and posed for pictures. Orange-colored

JACK SMITH: TRAVELERS DISCOVER ANEW THAT SEEING IS BELIEVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I have said, one of the rewards of travel is that it validates what one has 
read of famous places. Today we see everything in movies or on TV, but there is 
still no substitute for being there. 
</P>
<P>
Except for excursions to Long Beach, Balboa and Mojave, I had never traveled 
any distance from home until, at 18, I hitchhiked around the Southwest. I went 
to Yuma, Phoenix, Albuquerque, Taos, Denver, Salt Lake City and Sacramento, 
before coming home. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until I got to Salt Lake City, and gazed upon the famous Mormon 
Tabernacle, that I had that sense of verification. My books were right. There 
was indeed such a place. I was also reassured by the Capitol in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, as a scullion on the Matson Line, I sailed to Hawaii, American 
Samoa, the Fijis, New Zealand and Australia. Perhaps my greatest thrill in 
traveling was the early-morning sight of Diamond Head from the ship's bow. I 
believed then in King Kamehameha, Capt. Cook, Bligh and Mr. Christian, Robert 
Louis Stevenson and all the lore of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Since then I have stood inside the Parthenon, heard Big Ben toll from across 
the street, stared up into the dome of St. Peter's, heard the singing of 
bishops and the glory of Bach in Notre Dame and stood before the Great 
Emancipator's statue in the Lincoln Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Each of these confrontations, as I say, reinforced the beliefs that I had had 
about the world. If my books were right, if there was a Parthenon, then there 
must be a Colosseum, a Sphinx, a Taj Mahal; and if those edifices indeed 
existed, then there must have been a Caesar, a Napoleon, a Washington, a Madame 
de Pompadour and a Cleopatra. 
</P>
<P>
I am aware, however, that sometimes our first exposure to great monuments can 
be a disappointment. Perhaps that is subjective. I am reminded of the two women 
from Iowa who stood on the Palisades in Santa Monica and gazed out for the 
first time at the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
One said, "Why, it's not so big." 
</P>
<P>
"Speaking about having to see places to see if they really exist," writes John 
Degatina, "I finally went to the Grand Canyon. It didn't look as real or 
impressive as it did in Cinerama. . . . Maybe it's just too vast for me to 
appreciate. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, Degatina says he has never been out of the United States, but he has 
more feeling of reality about vacation spots around Paris than he does about 
Malibu. He thinks this might be due in part to the French Impressionist 
painters. 
</P>
<P>
That may be true. When I saw "A Day in the Country," that marvelous exhibition 
of French Impressionism at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, I felt as if I 
were actually walking through the French countryside or flying over it in a 
balloon. 
</P>
<P>
Degatina makes a provocative point about our own landscape. "Come to think of 
it, David Hockney's paintings look more like Southern California than the real 
thing does. Can't help but wonder why." 
</P>
<P>
I do not have the language, expertise or insight of an art critic, but I 
suspect Hockney's paintings look more like Malibu than Malibu does because they 
are Malibu intensified -- the vivid reds and greens, the sapphire pools, the 
golden flesh, the sense of time stilled in an exquisitely sensual environment. 
Also, they reflect a life too lush, opulent and sterile for ordinary mortals, 
yet in his work it seems palpable. If we had entree to that private Malibu, we 
would probably say, "Yes, there is such a place." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, I did not have a sense of America as reality until World War II, when I 
was transferred from Los Angeles to Washington by train. I remember that when 
we pulled into St. Louis, and I saw the name of some St. Louis brewery painted 
on the side of a brick building, I finally realized that America -- the 
heartland, the Mississippi River, Chicago, Toledo, Buffalo, New York City and 
Washington itself -- in fact existed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the miracle of jet travel, many children today are doomed to live their 
lives in the neighborhoods of their birth. Many Los Angeles children will never 
see the Music Center. And most will never see a David Hockney painting. 
</P>
<P>
We should make sure that, at least, they see the books that will tell them 
those things exist.

Big Screen Scene: San Francisco mayor Art Agnos got rave reviews for his 
performance after the big quake, but it will be months before critics review 
his big-screen debut. Agnos played himself last week in a scene from "Class 
Action," with Gene Hackman as a civil rights attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays the lawyer daughter of Hackman's character. 
Agnos sounded like an actor when he said, "I'm a little dissatisfied. My part's 
not big enough. I'm not talking, just walking."

Dallas, Live: The Jingle Bell Run, a zany Dallas event that mixes racing and 
costume competitions, this year featured 45 people in spotted suits 
masquerading as "101 Dalmatians" and barking a Christmas carol while jogging. 
</P>
<P>
Another group was dressed as a Nintendo game set, complete with video screen. 
Other zanies acted as rap-singing and dancing reindeer and as "Christmas 
seals," wearing brown trash bags and whiskers.

Tough Talk: The Rev. Jesse Jackson has warned students that drugs are more of a 
threat to black Americans than the Ku Klux Klan ever was. "What difference does 
it make if the doors are wide open and you are too drunk to stagger through the 
door?" Jackson asked students at Westport High School in Kansas City, Mo. "No 
one should have to beg you, no one should have to bribe you . . . to make you 
save yourself," he said. "Opportunity just gets you on the court; it doesn't 
make you win." 
</P>
<P>
Gown Goes: A sequined dress worn by Marilyn Monroe brought $14,300 at an 
auction of Hollywood memorabilia last weekend at Sotheby's auction house in New 
York. The siren-red gown, from the 1953 classic "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," was 
sold by an unidentified seller to an unidentified buyer. It had a presale 
estimate of $8,000 to $12,000. The long-sleeve dress sports a thigh-high slit 
and a flesh-tone chiffon panel over a neckline that plunges to the waist.

Two men killed when a Southern Pacific freight train hit them on tracks near 
the Contra Costa County community of Port Costa were identified by coroner's 
officials as a mentally retarded man and his counselor. Alan Boursse, 39, of 
the Berkeley area, and Georgio Melloni, 20, of Pinole, died in the accident 
about 25 miles northeast of San Francisco. Southern Pacific police officer 
Barry Ballence said two counselors and three clients from a Pinole residential 
facility were walking along the tracks when the eastbound train rounded a curve 
behind them. The train engineer saw a man about 100 yards away, walking in the 
middle of the tracks, with his back to the train, a Southern Pacific spokesman 
said.

A Silicon Valley exporter was sentenced to 33 months in prison and fined 
$150,000 for conspiring to ship guided missile parts to Iran. Ken Park of Los 
Altos Hills, owner of Ellin International Co. in Sunnyvale, pleaded guilty in 
August to the felony charge, and the government dropped six charges of export 
violations. He was sentenced in San Francisco by U.S. District Judge John 
Vukasin, who could have given him five years in prison. Prosecutors said Park 
shipped wing assemblies, illumination devices and other parts for the Hawk, 
Sidewinder and Sparrow missile systems, and falsely labeled them as truck and 
tractor equipment destined for South Korea.

Three thousand city officials from throughout California gathered in San 
Francisco for the 91st annual conference of the League of California Cities -- 
a three-day meeting scheduled for October but postponed due to the Oct. 17 
earthquake. The temblor not only changed the dates of the meeting but altered 
the agenda as well. A special series of sessions dealing with the earthquake 
were added for the conference.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: MOONSTRUCK SCHOLAR BARES THEORY IN UNUSUAL CARDIFF 
QUARTERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Articles about mooning always attract me. 
</P>
<P>
"Early Mooning in America" is the title. Lincoln Diamant, a New York historian 
and biographer, is the author. 
</P>
<P>
His argument is that European explorers discovered mooning -- described as the 
contemptuous baring of the buttocks -- in the Americas and joyfully took the 
practice home just like their other discoveries: corn, potatoes and tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
"Within half a century of Columbus' landing on San Salvador," Diamant writes, 
"the literate population of Europe was adding New World mooning to its broad 
arsenal of uncivilized rejoinder." 
</P>
<P>
It's all there, complete with scholarly footnotes, in Volume I of the Journal 
of Unconventional History. The Cardiff-based quarterly is the offbeat 
brainchild of co-editors Aline Homaday and Ann Elwood. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to provide a place for people who may have been shut out by the 
traditional professional journals," Elwood said. "We want things that are 
scholarly but controversial; new ideas that are not yet accepted." 
</P>
<P>
Volume I also has an essay by La Jolla historian Alice Goldfarb Marquis on "The 
Ballad of Jackson Pollock: Marlboro Man," and one on "Science, Reason and the 
German Utopia" by Hugh Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Elwood, 59, and Homaday, 66, have their own unconventional histories. Each 
earned a doctorate in history at UC San Diego after a career outside academe. 
</P>
<P>
Elwood was a free-lance writer (including children's books). Homaday was the 
publisher of the (San Diego) Daily Transcript from 1950 to 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Volume II, soon at selected bookstores, will look at wife-beating in Rhode 
Island and the European avant-garde. Volume I has already stirred up a ruckus. 
</P>
<P>
The mooning article brought a hot response from a San Francisco writer who says 
Diamant has it all wrong: that mooning was spotted as far back as the fall of 
Constantinople in 1204. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the invigorating give-and-take of intellectual life. 
</P>
<P>
Highfalutin Food for Thought 
</P>
<P>
Radicalizing prose is sometimes found in unlikely places. 
</P>
<P>
In the days before last week's strike authorization vote by Union-Tribune guild 
members, there was a clipping from the society pages of the San Diego Tribune 
posted prominently on the newsroom bulletin board at the San Diego Union. 
</P>
<P>
The clip told of the recent Christmas party at the La Jolla home of David 
Copley, president of Copley Press Inc. and son of publisher Helen Copley. A 
party complete with caterer and designer. 
</P>
<P>
"The party played out in a scene that was a nostalgic tour de force, the kind 
of glowing, sparkling, fragrant ideal seldom realized by even the most 
committed Christmas mad . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Copley greeted his guests at the entry, where a brightly lacquered antique 
sleigh was moored as backdrop for Dickensian costumed carolers. Santa cut 
through the crowd sampling cheeses and fine pate . . . 
</P>
<P>
"With champagne to wash it down, fare ranged from traditional ham biscuits to 
quail ragout and shellfish bisque (fun to slurp off cloudy puff pastry shells). 
Dessert included toothsome persimmon tarts and a deadly delicious chocolate 
density." 
</P>
<P>
To newspaper guild members, the message was clear: Let 'em eat cloudy puff 
pastry shells. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping Sweets Tax-Free 
</P>
<P>
Political rumble. 
</P>
<P>
* Libertarians don't win many elections but they do have fun. 
</P>
<P>
Take Dennis Thompson, the San Diego computer firm owner who is running for 
governor as a Libertarian. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't like Atty Gen. John Van de Kamp's proposal to tax candy. So he sent 
Van de Kamp a box of sour ball candies to show his displeasure. No response 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably hear from his dentist," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
* Opposition research has begun in the race for sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Jimno, on leave as police chief in Escondido, gave a stump speech Friday 
to San Diego's Catfish Club, a black professional organization. 
</P>
<P>
In the front row, with a tape recorder, was a visiting Jeanette Roache, wife of 
a rival candidate, Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache.

OPPOSING SIDES ON ABORTION RALLY AT CARL'S JR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-abortion and pro-choice factions clashed Sunday outside a North Hollywood 
Carl's Jr. over financial support the founder of the fast-food chain has given 
to anti-abortion efforts. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen pro-choice demonstrators held up signs urging motorists to 
boycott the restaurant on Sherman Way near Bellaire Avenue while about 65 
abortion opponents waved soft drinks and hamburgers at passers-by to show 
support for the restaurant and its founder, Carl Karcher. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-choice demonstrators were led by members of the San Fernando Valley 
chapter of the National Organization for Women, which in recent months has 
conducted similar protests at Carl's Jr. restaurants in Burbank, Studio City 
and Glendale, said spokeswoman Barri Falk. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out here because Karcher is giving money from his profits to 
anti-abortion groups," Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pro-choice and the majority of people are pro-choice. We're trying to 
tell them not to support Carl's Jr. because when they support Carl's Jr. 
they're supporting anti-choice people, people who would keep women enslaved. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
But anti-abortion activists -- who said they were alerted to the NOW protest by 
church ministers and a conservative radio talk show host -- packed the 
restaurant for more than an hour and demonstrated alongside Falk's group on the 
sidewalk in an effort to blunt NOW's boycott. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the man and I don't eat here," said Richard Pfeffer, an abortion 
opponent who said he decided to show support for Karcher after hearing about 
NOW's plans at his church, Bible Baptist in Tujunga. "But he's making a stand 
and I like that." 
</P>
<P>
Julia Lennan, spokeswoman for the Right to Life League of Southern California, 
said NOW's efforts to boycott the restaurant "blew up in their faces" because 
they were outnumbered by abortion foes "by 5 to 1 or more." 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to shut Carl's Jr. down and we're telling them that they don't 
have the numbers to do that," Lennan said. 
</P>
<P>
NOW's Falk countered that her organization was less interested in how many 
demonstrators showed up than in informing the public of Karcher's anti-abortion 
stand, hoping that will hurt his business. 
</P>
<P>
Carl's Jr. corporate spokesman Paul Mitchell declined to comment on the 
protest, saying his firm issued a blanket press statement responding to NOW's 
efforts several weeks ago. The restaurant's acting manager also declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, spokesmen for Anaheim-based Carl Karcher Enterprises, the parent 
firm of Carl's Jr., have denied allegations that a portion of every dollar 
spent at its restaurants is donated to the anti-abortion movement. They also 
said the boycott is misguided, since donations made to anti-abortion groups 
have come from individual executives, rather than from the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
In August, company spokeswoman Patricia Parks said that at most, the firm has 
contributed several hundred dollars to candidates and organizations associated 
with the anti-abortion movement. In the past five years, she added, no 
donations have been made directly by Karcher Enterprises to Operation Rescue or 
similar groups. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she said, "It's true that Mr. Karcher has been very open and 
public regarding his support of the pro-life philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Karcher is not going to change his views, we expect that the opposition 
against him will continue. . . . But from the company's perspective, we believe 
Mr. Karcher and the company shouldn't be punished for exercising his right to 
freedom of speech," Parks said.

SANTA CLAUS FLIES IN TOYS ON A BITTERSWEET MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Claus flew into Acton on Sunday afternoon, but via a helicopter instead 
of a sleigh. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the helicopter was piloted by Bob Garland, 36, outfitted in a Santa 
Claus suit. He surprised about 50 children, and undoubtedly a few adults, when 
he landed at the Robin's Nest trailer park with a big bag of presents. 
</P>
<P>
Garland's wife, Perri, 30, said the couple staged the giveaway to help them 
cope with the loss of their 5-year-old son, Ryan, who was killed in a horseback 
riding accident in October. The Garlands, who live in the trailer park, operate 
a small helicopter service. 
</P>
<P>
Garland said that her husband and Ryan talked several months ago about 
delivering presents to the youngster's friends by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
"Ryan used to ride around with Bob in the helicopter all the time," Garland 
said, "and he always wanted to see Santa Claus in a helicopter." 
</P>
<P>
After Ryan was killed, the Garlands decided to abandon their plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We just sat around and got very depressed," said Perri Garland. "But then we 
thought, 'Wait a minute. Let's do it for Ryan.' That's the biggest reason we 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
The couple's neighbors helped organize the event. On Sunday, Bob Garland went 
to Van Nuys Airport and rented a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
About 2:15 p.m., Garland's helicopter appeared above the Robin's Nest trailer 
park. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents ran outside and shouted to their children, 'Look, Santa's here,' " 
Perri Garland said. "Some of the kids said, 'Wait a minute, Santa's supposed to 
have a sleigh and reindeer.' They just got real excited." 
</P>
<P>
After landing, her husband stayed about two hours handing out presents and 
candy to the children, who ranged in age from 3 to 12, Garland said. 
</P>
<P>
A helicopter crew from a radio station spotted her husband flying in the area, 
followed him to the trailer park and joined in the fun, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Garland and her husband, who also have a 2-year-old daughter, Aron, had not 
called the media because they did not want publicity. However, she understood 
why the radio crew investigated the sighting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not every day you see Santa flying across the sky," she said.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood man was arrested on suspicion of murder after his wife died 
from injuries the man said she received "falling down the stairs, " authorities 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to an apartment in the 11000 block of Morrison Street 
shortly before 6 p.m. Saturday and found the woman unconscious on the living 
room floor, said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Christopher Vasquez. The woman died 
two hours later at North Hollywood Medical Center, Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had not learned the couple's identity, Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was arrested after detectives determined that the blunt-force injuries 
that killed the woman "were inconsistent with falling down stairs," Vasquez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The man complained of chest pains and was taken to the jail ward of Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center, Vasquez said.

IT'S TIME NFL ACTS TO KEEP UP WITH TELEVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY TRECKER, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Television so completely controls America's major sports decisions that one has 
to wonder what the NFL is going to do in order to keep the cash flowing to its 
teams at record levels. With the league's contract up for renewal, speculation 
is rife that changes must be made for the NFL to keep its megabuck image in a 
changing TV world. 
</P>
<P>
Pro football, of course, was the first American sport to truly understand the 
power of television. Back in the days when "knowledgeable" people argued for 
restrictions on the number of televised games in order to protect gates, the 
NFL offered maximum exposure to its teams in their home markets. The result was 
that a barely noticeable sport of the 1950s -- you could buy Giants tickets on 
game day quite easily -- became the spectator giant of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Now, baseball and basketball, both college and pro, are threatening football's 
television pre-eminence. With Major League Baseball looking at $1.5 billion in 
national television revenues in the next four years, college basketball netting 
at least a cool $1 billion in the next decade, and the NBA rights at more than 
$600 million annually, pro football is no longer the unchallenged rights-fee 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's current TV package funnels about $11 million annually to its teams, 
but not everything is wonderful about the way that deal works. For one thing, 
NBC simply doesn't have the guns to match CBS on Sunday coverage because it is 
stuck with the weaker American Football Conference. The AFC is not only less 
attractive on the field, it lacks the major market impact of the National 
Football Conference, so NBC loses in two ways: audience appeal and potential 
viewer reach. 
</P>
<P>
In a perfect world, the NFL leaders would recognize the easiest way to solve 
that problem is realignment. Although there would undoubtedly be much gnashing 
of teeth, such a straightforward bow in the direction of TV's needs would 
probably net the league increased long-range revenues. Not only would it solve 
the immediate imbalance between CBS and NBC's properties, but a "made for TV 
sales" alignment might even entice ABC to bid for Sunday afternoon games, thus 
driving up the price. 
</P>
<P>
How might such a divisional setup look? Try something like this: 
</P>
<P>
CBS divisions 
</P>
<P>
East: Giants, Jets, Patriots, Eagles, Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
Central: Vikings, Lions, Packers, Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
West: 49ers, Raiders, Chargers, Seahawks, Saints. 
</P>
<P>
NBC divisions 
</P>
<P>
East: Dolphins, Buccaneers, Falcons, Bills, Steelers 
</P>
<P>
Central: Bears, Colts, Browns, Bengals 
</P>
<P>
West: Rams, Cardinals, Cowboys, Oilers, Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
In such a setup, each network would retain eight "home" teams and acquire six 
new ones. The keys, obviously, would be the Rams and Bears moving to NBC, 
giving that network strong attractions in those major markets. CBS would gain a 
monopoly in New York as partial compensation and would keep the strong San 
Francisco, Washington and Philadelphia markets. 
</P>
<P>
There is another reason why the NFL ought to consider such an apparently 
radical change as it heads for the new decade. The growing power of regional 
sports networks could make them realistic players in the TV rights game by the 
end of the next decade. It behooves leagues -- right now -- to realign along 
smart geographic lines to avoid the type of cable TV problems we see in 
Connecticut, where NBA and NHL territorial rules cause market confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the NFL thinks along these lines or not, the fact is television ratings 
and markets are the key elements in healthy leagues. 
</P>
<P>
While the above is pure speculation, there is one NFL-TV move that seems quite 
likely to occur. That's the expansion of the ESPN cable package from its 
current eight Sunday nights to a full season of 16. It's a clear-cut way for 
the NFL to increase its cable revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The success of ESPN's NFL coverage was anticipated, of course, but the fact 
that there has been so little criticism of the league for removing those eight 
games from "free" television might well encourage further commitments to cable. 
That's another reason to plan ahead for the day when regional networks can 
offer their own megabucks for properties. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, cable remains only a source of additional revenues. Even its most 
optimistic proponents recognize that the inability to reach the whole nation 
remains a drawback. The next decade will see cable closer to 75 percent 
national penetration, but 100 percent coverage seems well into the future. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the broadcast networks are still so important to major sports, just 
one more reason why it makes sense for the NFL to deal with the Sunday 
afternoon imbalance in some concrete way. Realignment of the conferences and 
divisions is just one of the ways they might come to grips with television's 
"real" world of ratings and advertising sales.

Alberigo Evani scored on a free kick in overtime Sunday to give European 
champion A.C. Milan of Italy a 1-0 victory over South American champion 
Nacional Medellin of Colombia in the Toyota Cup soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
With just two minutes left in extra time, Evani's sharp kick from just outside 
of the penalty area got past Nacional's goalkeeper in the match played before a 
crowd of 62,000 at Tokyo's National Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, Roberto Donadoni was to kick but there was an opening to the left of 
the wall of the Colombian players, so I did it," Evani said. 
</P>
<P>
A.C. Milan came to Japan after winning the European Champion Clubs' Cup for the 
first time in 20 years. Nacional is the winner of the Copa Libertadores, the 
first time for Nacional.

SOUTHLAND GAS STATIONS GETTING SCARCER, BIGGER; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: THE LUNDBERG SURVEY SHOWS A 5.3% DROP IN OUTLETS THIS YEAR. AN ANALYST 
CITES THE SOARING COST OF LAND AS A MAJOR FACTOR FOR THE TREND.

Motorists are finding fewer service stations in Southern California than they 
did a year ago, but the ones remaining are bigger and more likely to be open 
all night. 
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a recent census by the Lundberg Survey, the number 
of stations in a four-county area fell 5.3% to 4,972 this year from 5,252 in 
1988. That is far below the 8,961 service stations 15 years ago, reported 
Lundberg, a North Hollywood-based gasoline marketing research firm. 
</P>
<P>
But the average number of gasoline nozzles per station actually increased this 
year, to more than 13 from 11.7. That's an average of one nozzle for every 150 
cars on the road in 1989, compared to one for every 155 cars in 1988 and one 
for every 105 cars in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The September census, which surveyed every retail gasoline and diesel outlet in 
the area, confirmed a decadelong move away from the once-familiar service 
station at virtually every major intersection -- with a mechanic on duty. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend has been toward fewer service stations with larger volumes, and 
that's just a matter of economics," said McDonald J. Beavers, an industry 
analyst and head of the Whitney Leigh Corp., a market research firm in Tulsa, 
Okla. "In the 1960s, major oil companies attempted to increase market share by 
building more outlets, and not enough attention was paid to the economics of 
each individual outlet, hence they were overbuilt. 
</P>
<P>
"But starting in the late 1970s, particularly, companies looked more at the 
economics of retail marketing and found that they'd best get rid of those 
outlets that did not stand on their own two feet," he said. "Nowadays, if 
you're talking about a major metropolitan area, it can cost as much as $1 
million just for the land and building." 
</P>
<P>
This year -- as another sign of the need to pump higher volumes of gas -- 202 
more stations in Southern California converted to 24-hour operation, an 
increase of 9.2% over a year ago, the census found. Virtually no stations were 
open all night in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"A service station today produces four- or five-fold what a station did four or 
five years ago," said Clay Warnock, the head of Western Regional Marketing for 
Unocal Corp. "It's essential to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the census confirmed that the continuing disappearance of 
service bays -- well-known to anyone who has ever searched in vain for a gas 
station to fix a broken fan belt. 
</P>
<P>
The average number of service bays per station declined to 1.3 from 1.6. About 
half of the stations continued to have a convenience store on the premises, the 
census added. 
</P>
<P>
But the decline does not necessarily translate into more hassles for motorists, 
observers said. For one thing, there are now quick lube and fast tuneup shops 
to take up the slack left by service stations. 
</P>
<P>
For another, new cars do not require as much of the maintenance that service 
station attendants once performed routinely: checking battery and oil levels, 
tire pressures, radiator water. 
</P>
<P>
For the driver who just wants to drive in, get gas, pay and go, the advent of a 
smaller number of larger, low-service stations means less time at the pump. 
</P>
<P>
"In that sense, the consumer can save money and time both," said Thomas F. 
Hogarty, research manager with the American Petroleum Institute, the oil 
industry's main trade group. "And the time saving is perhaps the biggest 
factor." 
</P>
<P>
Results of the census, which covered Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties, were provided to The Times prior to their publication in an 
upcoming edition of the survey's widely read Lundberg Letter. 
</P>
<P>
Other findings: 
</P>
<P>
* The total number of gasoline nozzles in the four-county area jumped to 65,052 
in 1989 from 61,572 in 1988. That is not much below the 65,415 in 1974, when 
there were more than twice as many service stations in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
* The total number of service bays dropped to 6,455 in 1989 from 8,545 in 1988 
and 20,610 in 1974. Some observers believe that the pace at which service bays 
are disappearing has slowed as some oil companies, such as Unocal and Chevron, 
use service as a marketing tool. 
</P>
<P>
* From 1988 to 1989, the total number of motor vehicles in Southern California 
has increased 2.2% to 9.76 million from 9.55 million. In 1974, there were 6.87 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* Southern California accounts for roughly 45% of all gasoline consumed in the 
entire state.

Harold Lloyd Copyright Suit Filed: A trust set up by silent film star Harold C. 
Lloyd filed suit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles Tuesday seeking to block 
the use of a picture of Lloyd on the cover of a videocassette catalogue. The 
suit charges that a firm called Video Yesteryear used a photograph of Lloyd 
without paying a fee to the Lloyd estate. The photo was from the film "Safety 
Last," in which Lloyd is shown clinging to the hands of a clock high above a 
street. Video Yesteryear could not be reached for comment. (Filed Dec. 12,

Fraud Prompts Court to Appoint Trustee: An independent trustee was appointed to 
manage 240 acres near Fontana, Calif., after a bankruptcy judge in U.S. 
District Court in Denver found that the current real estate management company 
had committed fraud and mismanagement, executives of Kaiser Steel Resources 
said Thursday. Kaiser is the largest creditor in the estate of Perma Pacific 
properties, the property owner, and is seeking control of the land. Kaiser had 
filed suit against Perma Pacific for return of the land, which it claimed Perma 
Pacific swapped for worthless Colorado real estate in 1985. Perma Pacific could 
not be reached for comment. (Filed Feb. 6, 1987, Case No. 87E135.)

the sale of stock by a company trying to raise $17 million to buy controlling 
interest in Mustang Ranch, the state's largest brothel. Mustang Ranch Inc. will 
be permitted to sell the shares at $10 apiece. The proceeds would be used to 
buy a 60% interest in the brothel, which is just east of Reno and owned by Joe 
Conforte, who would retain his 40% and continue to run the business. The 
underwriter, American Wallstreet Securities Inc. of Tampa, Fla., said 22 states 
have authorized sale of the stock.

ON TARGET: NICE SURPRISE FOR A BUSY VOLUNTEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lucille Boswell was the surprised weekend recipient of the Woman of the Year 
award from Women on Target at the group's annual Christmas brunch. 
</P>
<P>
Boswell, manager of consumer affairs for the Los Angeles office of Coca-Cola, 
had believed all along that Women on Target president Joan Graham was going to 
get the award. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked you," said a stunned Boswell, who even as she was receiving the 
award Saturday, thought it was to go to Graham. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so touched, you are all my friends. Bless you -- and yes, I'm going to 
cry," she said, wiping tears from her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Boswell was singled out for her involvement with many community groups, 
including the Child Guidance Centers, the Florence Crittenton Center and for 
founding Coca-Cola's Salute to the Black Family. 
</P>
<P>
Women on Target's focus is on the community as well. This 11-year-old Los 
Angeles-based organization of black businesswomen, artists and civic leaders is 
dedicated to improving the quality of life in the city's neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 women attended the brunch at the Wilfandel Club on West Adams 
Boulevard. It is a nonprofit clubhouse that was founded 44 years ago when 
minority groups were denied access to public meeting places. It is now used for 
cultural events, meetings, parties and weddings. 
</P>
<P>
The women brought gift-wrapped toys to be distributed by Elnido Service, the 
Youth and Family Center and the Los Angeles Unified School District Police 
Department's Christmas Program. Representatives outlined each group's programs 
and stressed the need for assistance, especially during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"Women on Target will continue to benefit the youth of tomorrow," Joan Graham 
said of the 150-member organization. "It's important for us to be a catalyst to 
ensure a future for them and equipping them with the necessary educational 
background -- that's what we're committed to. 
</P>
<P>
"This upcoming year we will also focus on the problem the black community has 
with racism," she added. "It's something we need to talk about more. We want to 
try and be a little more honest with each other, to bridge that gap. Racism is 
the cause of a lot of ills, and this is the core of what we need to start. And 
that will be a benefit to our children." 
</P>
<P>
Added Juanita Dudley, last year's Woman of the Year and past president of the 
group: "Very few people want to hear what women have to say. People say, 'Oh, 
you give to charitable groups and that's so great, but we don't want to hear 
what you have to say about political issues.' 
</P>
<P>
"But we do educate our members to what's important in the community. We started 
out with basic issues like housing and education, and we bring speakers in to 
tell women what's going on. And we have so many black women now who are 
entrepreneurs, it's very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's program also included performances by the Lafayette Players-West, 
directed by Virginia Capers. Cast members performed works by Alice Walker, 
Samm-Art Williams and Paul Laurence Dunbar. 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests were Ouida Gee, Betty McGill, Grace Robinson, Vera Branker, 
Tanis Johns, Honora Wells, Dr. Ann Shaw, Bette Cox, Aiko Mura-Taylor, Olivia 
Mitchell, Marguerite Williams, Wilmer James, Hilda Allen and Jean Sides.

SUNNY SIDE UP FOR EGG AT THE ATLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD ROUILARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malcolm Forbes was "on his motorcycle somewhere" according to Hal Rubinstein, 
the editor in chief of Forbes' new magazine Egg. The supreme no-show went 
mostly unnoticed. The Atlas Bar &amp; Grill on the ground floor of the Wiltern 
Theatre -- Mario Tamayo's latest restaurant -- was enough of an attraction to 
make up for the less than star-struck Egg magazine fete. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlas interior, a beyond-gilded extravaganza by designer Ron Meyers, 
knocked out the guests. Enormous wrought-iron sculptures of the gods surround 
an eating arena over which hang chandeliers the size of Rhode Island. The eye 
is further accosted by enough gold leaf to please Louis XIV. Jeff Goodman, who 
created most of the finishes in the cafe, said that, "it took two weeks to get 
the gold paint out from underneath my fingernails." 
</P>
<P>
Fox chieftain Barry Diller thought the place "looked like a museum." Actress 
Marsha Mason proclaimed that "it's just too hip." Franco-American clothing 
designer Michelle Lamy could only say "ooh la la, look at thees." Other too-hip 
trendies ooh-la-la-ing included Barbara and Tim Leary, art collectors Tony and 
Karen Barone, Trumps restaurant's Michael Roberts, composer Allee Willis, actor 
Steve Antin, jewelry designer Diana Hammro and fashion designer Jef Huereque. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Yarborough, the West Coast editor of Egg, was pleased about the turnout. 
"Egg is really bicoastal," said Yarborough about the New York-based 
publication. "But we're only going to use Angelenos to talk about this city. No 
New York writers here." 
</P>
<P>
"It's stupid to avoid the pre-eminence of L.A. in a pop culture magazine," 
added Rubinstein. "Don't compare Los Angeles to anything." 
</P>

Pete, who nevertheless seems to be in the good graces of his TV assistant Magg

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: HE'S DANGEROUS AS ANGRY DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Whenever my husband gets really angry, he invariably jumps 
into his car and drives off. He's had several serious accidents and I believe 
this is no coincidence. Why does he do this and how can I help him?-C.W. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR C.W.: Cars represent power to many people, especially young males. This is 
one of the many reasons that automobile insurance is frequently more expensive 
for young male drivers. This is why motors are revved and why tires squeal as 
young drivers try to go around corners at excessive speed. Now, it's possible 
that you're saying that your husband isn't young. Some men don't mature as 
quickly as others and continue to use cars in the same way they did as 
adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
Anger results from a feeling of powerlessness. When a person leaps in his car 
in a flash of anger, he's much more likely to have an accident and to injure 
himself or someone else. When people take their anger out on their car, when 
they get behind the wheel when they're in a rage, the likelihood of serious 
accidents soars. Studies reveal that when people are angry, their reflexes 
aren't as good and they're definitely more accident-prone. 
</P>
<P>
Your husband needs to learn how to talk about his feelings and to find 
constructive ways to solve his problems. He would profit from assertiveness 
training. He needs to learn that it's all right to be angry, but it is also 
possible to talk rationally about feelings without resorting to aggression or 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: As long as I can remember I've had a terrible fear of 
flying. It was so bad I even contemplated going to a hypnotist to overcome it. 
What really concerned me was that I was planning a honeymoon trip to Europe. My 
new husband convinced me that everything would be fine. I didn't have time to 
get therapy for my phobia, but much to my amazement, when I got on the plane I 
had no fear and have had none since. What happened? -- R.D. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR R.D.: I'm not sure, but my guess is that your new husband gave you a sense 
of trust you didn't have before. The fear of flying is frequently related to a 
fear of losing control. Unconsciously, you feel if you're not in the driver's 
seat -- at the controls -- something dreadful will happen. 
</P>
<P>
On your honeymoon, you may have discovered that the world didn't come to an end 
if you lost control. In a satisfying sexual relationship, both partners must 
have enough trust to be able to surrender themselves and to lose control or to 
be swept up in the moment of passion. 
</P>
<P>
It may sound absurd, but this surrender may have laid the groundwork for you to 
enjoy your flight.

PROTECT EYES FROM LIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I've read about the dangers of artificial tanning, especially how it 
could affect the eyes. Would this be a problem if the person closed his eyes or 
used sunglasses? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Closing the eyes or using regular sunglasses is not sufficient 
protection when you expose yourself to light from artificial tanning equipment. 
If you insist on using such equipment despite the risks involved, you should 
wear special protective glasses.

A Film Goes to Washington: There will be a Capitol Hill screening of Miramax 
Films' critically hailed film "My Left Foot," the story of Ireland's late 
disabled artist Christy Brown, on Feb. 6 to focus attention on the proposed 
American Disabilities Act. The legislation, which Congress will vote on 
sometime after it reconvenes in January, is a sweeping mandate to end 
discrimination against the disabled in the workplace and to bring them into 
America's economic and social mainstream. Actor Daniel Day-Lewis, director Jim 
Sheridan and members of the Brown family from Dublin will attend the screening, 
which will include a rally in support of the legislation. In the film, 
Day-Lewis plays Brown, who had cerebral palsy but became a painter and writer 
while able to move only his left foot. According to director Sheridan, 
Day-Lewis learned to paint with his left foot, stayed in his wheelchair from 
morning to night and had other people feed him his meals in order to immerse 
himself in the role. Claudia Puig

SECOND JOFFREY CAST BRINGS CHILL OF FORMALITY TO 'NUTCRACKER'

<TEXT>
<P>
A chill wind of formality blew over the Kingdom of the Sweets as a new Sugar 
Plum Fairy presided over a second cast in the Joffrey Ballet "Nutcracker" at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Jodie Gates danced the role with a seriousness, aloofness and self-sufficiency 
that belong more properly in some other classical or Romantic ballet, but she 
offered fascinating compensations Thursday: gorgeous placement, generous 
amplitude of phrasing, fearfully strong pointe work, even a sense of the 
burdens of monarchy. 
</P>
<P>
For once, someone was able to look unmechanical in the propelled, hard-edged 
style of arm movement that seems to have become a company affliction. 
</P>
<P>
Mismatched as her Nutcracker Prince was the pliant, expressive Tyler Walters, 
who had a bad night technically, blurring shapes in the air and consistently 
making bad landings. But he partnered attentively and mimed the recapitulation 
of the Mouse Battle with a terror and vulnerability missing in the scene 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' hauteur was all the more noticeable after Charlene Gehm's beaming warmth 
and elegance as the Snow Queen in the opening performance of the engagement. 
Gehm had been partnered strongly by the noble Daniel Baudendistel. 
</P>
<P>
Filling in for Carl Corry, who had injured his knee, Edward Stierle repeated 
his virtuosic performance as Fritz and again appeared in the Chinese Dance, 
this time opposite a springy Cameron Basden. Carole Valleskey and Pascal 
Benichou enacted the hectic courting of the Columbine-Harlequin duet with fine 
sense of comic timing. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Narbutas attended Valerie Madonia in the Arabian Dance with even more 
heat and fixated sensuality than his predecessor had showed. Joseph Schnell 
inherited the Nutcracker Doll duties and executed them with crispness and 
clarity (however, unlike his Wednesday counterpart, Schnell was given no 
opportunity to take a curtain call with unmasked face). Alexander Grant and 
Mary Barton again took the roles of Drosselmeyer and Clara. 
</P>
<P>
John Miner conducted the Pacific Symphony with similar speed but marginally 
more shaping and sensitivity than his predecessor, and the orchestra responded 
optimistically.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 30TH ANNIVERSARY SHOWING OF ORIGINAL 'ANNE FRANK' AT BING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To commemorate the 30th anniversary of George Stevens' "The Diary of Anne 
Frank" LACMA will present the film Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in the Bing Theater in 
its original roadshow version, which has been out of circulation for three 
decades and is 20 minutes longer than the cut that went into general release. 
</P>
<P>
"The Diary of Anne Frank" stands the test of time magnificently. In replicating 
meticulously the tall old building in Amsterdam in which Anne Frank, her family 
and others hid from the Nazis for over two years, Stevens left off one side, 
which allowed him to move the camera swiftly from floor to floor, letting us 
see what the Franks et al could only hear from their split-level attic. Stevens 
puts what sounds like a theatrical device to an intensely cinematic effect, and 
it is typical of the imagination with which he and writers Frances Goodrich and 
Albert Hackett adapted their play, based on Frank's diary, to the screen. The 
film is never stagy, yet we experience both the claustrophobia of those in 
hiding and the soaring of Anne's poetic imagination, which knew no walls. 
</P>
<P>
The film is at once the story of an exceptional individual's coming of age and 
the study of eight people living in constant fear and in cramped quarters but 
managing to hold on to their humanity and to live their lives with as much 
meaning and fullness as possible. There have been many Holocaust dramas and 
documentaries since this film was released, but time has only increased the 
impact of "The Diary of Anne Frank" and underlined its tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
The cast is ensemble playing at its best. There was considerable controversy at 
the time in the casting of the non-Jewish Millie Perkins as Anne, but she is 
certainly radiant and captivating. Joseph Schildkraut and Gusti Huber are 
Anne's parents, figures of enormous strength and dignity. Shelley Winters is 
the vulgar but kindly Mrs. Van Daan, and Ed Wynn is Dussell, a gentle but 
crotchety and pessimistic elderly dentist. Rounding out the attic's inhabitants 
are Lou Jacobi as the portly Van Daan, Richard Beymer as his teen-age son and 
Diane Baker as Anne's older, more reserved sister. Their benefactors are played 
by Douglas Spencer, proprietor of the building's spice factory, and his 
secretary Miep (Dody Heath). We soon forget the cast's variety of accents. 
</P>
<P>
The romantic and creative yearnings of Anne, who is 13 when she goes into 
hiding, play against the film's frequent suspense, which occurs most 
agonizingly when Spencer's office is robbed not once but twice while the antics 
of Beymer's cat threaten to expose the hiding place. Punctuating the daily 
lives of the Franks and their friends are air raids, the sound of Nazi soldiers 
marching on cobblestone streets and the ominous siren of the Black Marias in 
which the Nazis round up the Jews. In the face of unceasing peril and 
uncertainty Anne somehow was able to summon within herself the faith to confide 
to her diary that "I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are 
really good at heart."

D'ARBY SHOWCASES POWERFUL VOICE 
</P>

The amps had hardly heated up at the Park Plaza Hotel on Friday when Terence 
Trent D'Arby and his band executed a heart-stopping drop-down, from the 
martial-tempo storm warning of "Rain" to the elongated lament of Smokey 
Robinson's ballad "Who's Lovin' You." In that one bravado stroke, the 
London-based American staked out the breadth of his emotional and musical 
spread and forged a firm link with his audience. 
</P>
<P>
There was one problem though: Rather than riding a triumphant crest, the man 
with the million-dollar voice is battling to keep his head above water. Radio 
isn't playing his new album "Neither Fish nor Flesh," people aren't buying it, 
and instead of moving up from the Palladium to amphitheaters or forums, he 
presided over a handful -- fewer than 1,000 -- in the ersatz Egyptian splendor 
of a ballroom at the old hotel. 
</P>
<P>
That could be demoralizing for someone as insistent on his own importance as 
D'Arby, but he responded with a charged, intensely personal performance. It was 
like a leader and his loyal troops huddled in there against the puzzling 
indifference outside, and it yielded a different kind of triumph. 
</P>
<P>
The concert took its main cues from the spirit of the old soul revue: playful, 
split-second stops and starts, gospel-derived pressure and release, volcanic 
ballads. Throw in James Brown splits, a David Lee Roth toe-touching leap, and a 
rubber-legged brand of dancing that's calculated enough to be sharp but 
instinctive enough to be loose. 
</P>
<P>
Decked out like a rock 'n' roll privateer, D'Arby was sweet and playful, and 
imperial without being arrogant -- he seemed to take true joy in spanning the 
front of the stage, crouching down and clasping hands with the fans. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly, though, there's that voice, from raspy roar to piercing wail to agile 
scatting. It's a wonder of nature and a sacred trust not to be used lightly. 
The vision thing will either come together or it won't, but as long as he can 
sing like that, you have to listen. RICHARD CROMELIN

POP CAPSULES: PAN-CARIBBEAN SOUND FROM THE SYSTEM BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN

<TEXT>
<P>
The System Band didn't need to warm up the audience at the Music Machine on 
Saturday. Thirty seconds into the 13-piece Haitian group's set, a steady stream 
of couples was en route to the dance floor, setting the tone for the second 
night of the New York-based band's local debut. 
</P>
<P>
The Haitian compas style became something of a Pan-Caribbean sound in the 
System Band's hands. The keyboard melodies frequently recalled the steel drums 
of Trinidad, the 4/4 bass drum and loping bass pulse brought zouk to mind -- 
not surprisingly since compas was a big early influence on zouk. But the horn 
parts and overall ambience of the music had a pronounced Latin tinge, although 
a more rounded sound than the sharp, angular lines of, say, salsa. 
</P>
<P>
The group's focus on the dancers and the spirit of the moment -- be it 
reflected in on-stage clowning, ebullient dance steps or a middle-of-the-road 
lounge touch -- enabled the System Band to weather the set's rough edges and 
ragged patches. And the Formula One's potent opening set indicated that the 
local compas unit has arrived as a pretty formidable force in its own right.DON

LONG BEACH 'NUTCRACKER' HAS TOO MANY ORNAMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lewis Segal 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crammed with special effects, the familiar Long Beach Ballet version of "The 
Nutcracker" has nearly everything that money can buy. This year, the 
spare-no-expense innovations include a shower of fireworks behind the 
production's trademark flying sleigh, the dancing of two guests from the 
Bolshoi Ballet and the authoritative conducting of ballet specialist Patrick 
Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, if all you want from any "Nutcracker" is an opulent, 
family-oriented, nominally cultural holiday entertainment, seek (and read) no 
further. 
</P>
<P>
Those who prize choreography and dancing may be less satisfied. On Saturday 
afternoon at the Terrace Theater, the version by David Wilcox and Terri Lewis 
again lurched from broad storytelling pantomime to faceless classicism and back 
for no apparent reason. Clara kept going onto pointe and noodling about -- but 
who could tell how her steps and poses related to her feelings or the plot? The 
why of this version proved very weak indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Corps passages (including the Mirlitons ensemble) looked well drilled Saturday 
afternoon, but all of the company soloists were technically unreliable except 
for the accomplished Helena Ross as Dewdrop. Indeed, Ross' refinement and the 
bravura of the Bolshoi guests only heightened the sub-professional execution of 
Long Beach Ballet as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Dancing their Bolshoi choreography in their Bolshoi costumes, Vitali Artyushkin 
and his wife, Alla Khaniashvili-Artyushkina, capitalized on the extreme stretch 
and velocity of Soviet style. Unfortunately, they also demonstrated some of the 
crudities of that style: stop-and-go phrasing (lots of walking and waiting 
between feats) and the tendency to force virtuosity onto unsuitable music. 
</P>
<P>
Artyushkina is far too unyielding a dancer to be an ideal Sugar Plum Fairy -- 
if she had been in the original cast, Tchaikovsky would probably have scored 
her solo for steel guitar rather than celesta. But she can do turns 
brilliantly, and did on Saturday at every opportunity. Her husband partnered 
her attentively and their daughter appeared with 19 other kiddies in the Mother 
Ginger divertissement. 
</P>
<P>
Twins Meagan and Leah Watson doubled as Clara, bringing off switcheroo effects 
in both acts. Dudley Davies made a sprightly Drosselmeyer and Tzer-Shing Wang 
looked highly promising as the Snow Queen.Lewis Segal

PACIFIC DANCE ENSEMBLE SHOWCASES CHOREOGRAPHER MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because modern dance is an art emphasizing both personal vision and an original 
movement language, sampler programs often prove frustrating. Case in point: the 
five-part Pacific Dance Ensemble performance Friday at the Assistance League 
Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of drawing you into an individual artist's unique sensibility, this 
evening emphasized variety -- as if the components were interchangeable 
showpieces. The juxtapositions yielded no new insights and there were none of 
the extenuating justifications for such programming: a shared special premise 
or purpose, for instance, or the chance to reach the big audiences unavailable 
to struggling single-choreographer companies. This was variety by default. 
</P>
<P>
First up, Gilberte Meunier's formal quintet "It Was a Large Room" (music by 
Laurie Anderson) deftly contrasted weighty circular motion and paths with 
buoyant forward-and-back actions and trajectories. Increasingly, however, 
Meunier's resourceful spatial design dominated (and unified) her contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
Next at bat: Young-Ae Park's perplexing "A Wrinkle in Space (Par Avion)," 
largely overwhelmed by a haunting original score by Lorenzo Buhne and obsessed 
with contrasts of its own -- between walking steps and fluid, lyrical dancing, 
for example. Sometimes Park took commonplace gestures (including a handshake) 
and isolated them, and sometimes the formal dancing highlighted the rigidity 
and artifice of academic placement. 
</P>
<P>
Park set up all manner of tantalizing dichotomies, but who had time to sort out 
her ambitious playoffs between "natural" and "unnatural" movement, societal and 
artistic codes of motion? -- because on came Lisbeth Davidow's "Full Circle." 
This surging duet incorporated a wedge-shaped sculpture unit with seven 
attached doors (each one smaller than the last) by Megan Williams. Set to music 
by Egberto Gismonti, it was exactly the kind of piece that succeeds on such a 
program: simple, showy, with no loose ends or aftereffect whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
Following intermission came Karl Schaffer and Erik Stern's ironic "The Curse of 
E.S.P." (previously reviewed) and Tina Gerstler's new trio "Talking to Myself," 
which featured an artfully layered score by Brad Dutz that ideally complemented 
Gerstler's theme: the paralysis resulting from overlapping confusion and 
self-doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Using gesture to objectify states of mind and structural ploys to make 
purposeful movement statements out of supposedly purposeless behavior, Gerstler 
created something distinctive, exciting and very finely wrought. She is an 
increasingly important locally based artist, not always well served by these 
grab-bag bills, but here quietly triumphant. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Dance Ensemble performed all five works capably and the program boasted 
first-rate lighting and sound.

'KOVACS AND KAUFMAN': GETTING THE PICTURE ON COMIC GENIUSES; 
</P>
<P>
FANTASY: LONG BEACH MUSEUM OF ART ALSO OFFERS 'MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR '89,' A 
CHRISTMAS SHOW OF ART ROOTED IN FANTASY TO ENTICE CHILDREN'S WONDER AND 
IMAGINATION.

<P>
"I never told a joke in my life," the late comic genius Andy Kaufman once 
declared. As can be seen in "Kovacs and Kaufman," a retrospective survey of the 
television work of Kaufman and early video pioneer Ernie Kovacs (on view at the 
Long Beach Museum of Art through Jan. 7), Kaufman wasn't kidding. Often 
dismissed as a tasteless vulgarian with a few screws loose, Kaufman's comedy 
was in fact so revolutionary and sophisticated that no one knew what to make of 
it. People tended to laugh nervously at Kaufman if they laughed at all. 
</P>
<P>
Best known as the lovably innocent Latka, a featured character in the TV series 
"Taxi," Kaufman adopted a persona as a stand-up comic (a term that hardly 
encompasses what he did) that was anything but innocent. Perplexing and 
willfully annoying, he seemed driven to violate the rules of TV etiquette, and 
he got away with some amazing things on the air; he taunted women into 
wrestling matches, started a brawl on a variety show and panhandled David 
Letterman's studio audience. Much of his material was designed to point up the 
questionable authenticity of the emotions engendered by television, and to 
confront audiences with their own expectations. In the two Kaufman specials on 
view here (one from 1977 and one shot in 1983 just before his death of lung 
cancer), we see him at the peak of his powers. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman claims never to have seen Ernie Kovacs, who died in a 1962 auto 
accident, but Kovacs covered much of Kaufman's turf 20 years earlier. Like 
Kaufman, Kovacs didn't tell jokes, was essentially a conceptualist, and had the 
soul of a mutineer. The leading provocateur of television's Golden Age, Kovacs 
was the first to poke holes in the fake reality of television, and he came up 
with dozens of brilliantly innovative ways to wiggle out of the talking-head 
box and push the limits of the medium. Employing techniques revolutionary for 
the time -- split-screens, negative images, miniaturizations -- he talked to 
his crew while on the air, discussed the sponsors products in a candid 
off-the-cuff manner, drew attention to the technology of TV and barraged the 
audience with abstract visual non sequiturs. 
</P>
<P>
Kovacs had an innate understanding of the sight-gag potential of video space, 
and there is very little dialogue in his comedy -- he was big on choreographing 
weird scenes in sync with music, and employed music as a central structuring 
device. As with Kaufman, there's a dark undercurrent of violence to much of 
Kovacs' material, which is invariably presented as harmless silliness; the 
drunk magician accidentally stabs his assistant, the track star is shot by the 
official with the starting pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Kovacs' material is 30 years old, it doesn't seem remotely dated or 
quaint. With roots in Dadaism and Surrealism, it has a timeless quality, and 
this show should be required viewing for anyone with an interest in comedy or 
video. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view is "The Magical Mystery Tour '89," this year's installment of the 
museum's annual Christmas show celebrating art rooted in the idea fantasy. 
Designed to tickle the child's sense of wonder and imagination that supposedly 
lurks within all of us cranky, overworked adults, this is a colorful, 
lighthearted show, at turns silly and strange. Showcasing work by 10 artists, 
it's a charmingly unpretentious exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Botto shows color photographs of surreal tableaux constructed out of 
miniature toys. Crowded compositions cluttered with brightly colored junk, his 
pictures spell fun at a glance, but in fact, they pulsate with paranoia. In 
"Suburbia," for instance, we see an urban landscape grided with a row of 
identical houses nestled under a freeway jammed to a standstill with cars. 
Unfortunately, this fantasy is a dead ringer for reality. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Lujan (a.k.a. Magu) offers "Magulandia," a hysterically cheerful 
life-size tableau reminiscent of Red Grooms. In Magulandia, dogs have taken the 
place of people and they mimic human behavior; we see dogs strutting cool 
threads on the avenue, dogs driving low-rider cars. Tom Foolery employs the 
humble carrot for his central motif and shows several works from his Carrot Air 
Force, a series he's been working on since 1979. Struck by the resemblance 
between the carrot and the body of an airplane, he makes highly detailed model 
planes (piloted by rabbits) and positions them in beautifully crafted settings. 
</P>
<P>
The piece de resistance of the show is a room filled with life-size animals by 
various artists. Included are two bizarre hooved creatures by Ken Dawson 
Little, whose coats are made of dozens of pairs of shoes, two inscrutable sheep 
by Francois-Xavier Lalanne and Felipe Archuleta's wooden pig (accompanied by 
his family), who is being kissed on the top of his porcine head by a 
long-necked wooden swan made by John Meyer. Also on the scene are two sleek 
wooden coyotes and an aluminum hawk by Gwynn Murrill (known for her gracefully 
crafted sculptures of animals), and a screeching bald eagle carved by an 
anonymous folk artist. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Frimkess Wolff creates shimmering curtains made of monofilament line 
(plastic string) strung with tiny silver and brass bells, while Sheila Klein 
designs jewelry for plants and buildings. Illustrating her ideas with blow-ups 
of re-photographed photo montages, Klein shows us a skyscraper wearing a 
bracelet, a palm tree sporting an ornate earring. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by a visit to relatives who live in a Scottish castle, Slater Barron 
created an ornate room decked out in 18th-Century drag, whose walls are lined 
with ancestral portraits. Barron's material of choice is lint which she 
scavenges from clothes dryers, and the portraits are executed in colored lint. 
All that lint sets the mind spinning, and one comes away from the piece with a 
vision of the artist sneaking in and out of self-service laundries.

"Do the Right Thing," Spike Lee's dramatic anatomy of an urban race riot, was 
named best picture of 1989 by the Los Angeles Film Critics Assn. Saturday, and 
Lee was named best director. 
</P>
<P>
The film, which was a hit with critics but ignored by the jury at this year's 
Cannes Film Festival, also won awards for Danny Aiello for best supporting 
actor and for Bill Lee -- Spike's father -- for music. 
</P>
<P>
"Do the Right Thing," made for a modest $6 million and distributed by Universal 
Pictures, chronicles the events that take place during one day, the hottest day 
of summer, in the racially tense Bedford-Stuyvesant area of New York City. 
Aiello plays the pivotal role of Sal, an Italian-American whose neighborhood 
pizza parlor becomes the setting for the day-end's violence. 
</P>
<P>
Three other films -- "My Left Foot," "sex, lies and videotape" and "The 
Fabulous Baker Boys" -- were multiple winners with the L.A. critics. 
</P>
<P>
"My Left Foot" won the best actor award for Daniel Day-Lewis, who portrays the 
severely crippled Irish painter Christy Brown, and the best supporting actress 
award for Brenda Fricker, Brown's indomitable mom. 
</P>
<P>
Andie MacDowell, the frigid New Orleans housewife in "sex, lies and videotape," 
and Michelle Pfeiffer, the sensuous lounge singer in "The Fabulous Baker Boys," 
tied for best actress. "The Fabulous Baker Boys" also won for Michael Balhaus' 
cinematography. "sex, lies and videotape" got a second honor when the 26 voting 
critics selected Laura San Giacomo, MacDowell's lustful younger sister in the 
film, for their New Generation Award for promising new talent. 
</P>
<P>
The best screenplay award went to Gus Van Sant and Daniel Yost, co-writers of 
"Drugstore Cowboy," a sort of Bonnie and Clyde of '60s drug culture, which they 
adapted from a novel by James Fogle. Van Sant, singled out for a special award 
by the L.A. critics group two years ago for his first film, "Mala Noche," 
directed "Drugstore Cowboy," which was the runner-up to "Do the Right Thing" in 
the best picture category. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger &amp; Me," Michael Moore's documentary quest to bring General Motors 
Chairman Roger Smith to Flint, Mich., to see the effects of his closing of 11 
auto plants in the town, was named best documentary. Warner Bros. picked up the 
film for commercial distribution and launches its national opening Tuesday 
night in Flint. 
</P>

Hollywood.

Bomb squads found explosives in a package addressed to "someone in the court 
system" at the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals headquarters today, two days 
after a letter bomb killed an 11th Circuit judge in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Shaken employees were evacuated from the five-story court building in downtown 
Atlanta shortly before 10 a.m. The bomb, in a small brown package, was 
discovered during a random sampling of the mail. 
</P>
<P>
An officer in head-to-toe protective gear removed the package -- about 10 
inches by 10 inches and four inches deep -- and placed it in a bomb-proof 
canister. It was taken "to a safe location," police Maj. W. W. Holley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta incident occurred just two days after 11th Circuit Judge Robert 
Vance was killed by a letter bomb in his Alabama home. Vance's wife remains 
hospitalized with injuries suffered in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
"While screening the mail in the federal courthouse in Atlanta, a second device 
containing a similar explosive device was found," FBI Agent Allen Whittaker 
said. "That matter is being approached with a great deal of caution." 
</P>
<P>
Whittaker said the package was addressed to "someone in the court system" but 
would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Police and military bomb experts continued to search the court building, a 
national historic site. 
</P>
<P>
Military explosives experts from nearby Ft. Gillem arrived on the scene and 
carried bomb disposal equipment into the structure. 
</P>
<P>
The package had an address label on the front and had come by mail, not hand 
delivery, Holley said. He refused to say to whom the package was addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Officers examined X-ray pictures before removing the package through the 
court's front door under a large flag flying at half-staff in memory of Vance. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have speculated that Vance's murder may have had something to do with 
his reviews of drug cases in Florida, including a connection to Colombian drug 
lords. One official played down the Colombian drug angle, saying, "We have no 
motive and no suspects."

A 16-year-old boy was killed on the Glendale Freeway in a traffic accident 
Sunday night between two cars headed to a party, the California Highway Patrol 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified as Michael Gold of Los Angeles, a coroner's spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold was riding in a Volkswagen van that was following a car to a party in Los 
Angeles when the van and car collided, CHP Officer Tami Low said. The accident 
occurred about 7:15 p.m. on the southbound Glendale Freeway north of Holly 
Drive, Low said. Six youths, ages 14 to 17, were riding in the van and car. 
</P>
<P>
As the two vehicles headed down a hill, the 16-year-old girl driving the car 
braked to avoid moving too far ahead of the van, Low said. But she lost 
control, spinning into the center divider and striking the van, which 
overturned and threw Gold to the pavement, Low said. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger in the van and two passengers in the car sustained minor injuries, 
Low said. Gold was pronounced dead at the scene.

KILLINGS REPORTED IN ROMANIA AS FORCES FIRE ON DEMONSTRATORS

Dozens of anti-government demonstrators may have been killed by security forces 
in Romania, the first deaths in the wave of uprisings against Communist rule in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
A Yugoslav witness said today that security forces -- some firing rifles and 
from helicopters -- crushed a protest by 10,000 people who took to the streets 
Sunday shouting "Freedom!" and "Down with Ceausescu!" 
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of people were falling on the pavement in front of my eyes," Radislav 
Dencic, a student at Timisoara, where the protest occurred, told reporters when 
he returned to Yugoslavia from the Transylvanian city today. 
</P>
<P>
Dencic estimated dozens were killed and said he personally saw three corpses, 
including that of a little child wrapped in white linen, lying in the street. 
</P>
<P>
He said smoke poured from the city's police headquarters, apparently after it 
was attacked in the toughest protest in two years against the government of 
President Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
First details filtering out in Yugoslav and Hungarian media of the protest in 
one of Europe's most rigid Communist states spoke of many injuries and arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Timisoara was sealed off by army tanks and other armored vehicles, the Yugoslav 
news agency Tanjug said. Romania closed its borders with Bulgaria, Yugoslavia 
and Hungary.

Japanese and Soviet negotiators trying to draft a treaty to formally end their 
World War II hostilities wound up talks today with "absolutely no new points of 
contact," a Foreign Ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
Although both governments have expressed a desire to improve their chilly 
relations, the Japanese official said neither was willing to compromise on a 
territorial dispute over several islands in the southern Kurile chain held by 
the Soviets since the end of the war in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
"There were absolutely no new points of contact," said the Japanese official. 
He said the Soviet delegation called Soviet possession of the islands a 
"postwar reality" and urged Japan to "assume a stance that recognizes the 
results of the war."

<TEXT>
<P>
The National Parks Service plans to relocate the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, the 
nation's oldest and tallest brick lighthouse, once it can be strengthened for 
the move. 
</P>
<P>
The lighthouse is threatened by wave action now that sand dunes have eroded and 
can no longer protect it. When the black-and-white-striped lighthouse was built 
in 1870, it was 1,500 feet from the Atlantic Ocean. It currently is 160 feet 
from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Workers will renovate and strengthen the 208-foot-tall lighthouse to reduce the 
risk of damage when it is moved, said Robert Baker, the park service's 
Southeastern director. 
</P>
<P>
The service has dropped plans by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build a 
$5.6-million barrier around three sides of the lighthouse to keep waves from 
bashing it, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Attempting to protect the lighthouse from its present location is ultimately 
futile," Baker said.

Mayor-Elect David N. Dinkins today named Houston Police Commissioner Lee Brown 
as his new police commissioner after he takes office New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Brown will replace Acting Police Commissioner Richard Condon, who was named by 
Mayor Edward I. Koch after Benjamin Ward resigned Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm most happy Chief Brown has chosen to come to New York to take this job," 
Dinkins said. "Of all of the finalists, he seems to be the absolute best in the 
country. I think that the Police Department will recognize Lee Brown for who he 
is and what he is. He is a true professional." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 51, a native of Wewoka, Okla., became Houston police chief in 1982, the 
first black to hold the job. He began his police career in 1960 in San Jose 
where he served as a patrolman for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose Police Chief Joseph McNamara was among those considered for the New

China and the United States said today they have opened talks on resuming the

China's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. 
</P>

China's State Education Commission and the U.S. Embassy said their 
representatives met for the first time last week -- just days after U.S. 
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft's fence-mending visit to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side linked the talks to Scowcroft's visit, but embassy spokesman Ed 
Loo acknowledged, "There wasn't much going on before." 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States had been seeking a renewal of the 
government-sponsored Fulbright program "for some time." 
</P>
<P>
China announced this fall that it was halting the program for a year.

Jeff Sagansky, a former NBC executive who now heads Tri-Star Pictures, was 
named today as president, CBS Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Sagansky will take over programming for the network on Jan. 1. CBS, which once 
dominated television entertainment, has been No. 3 in prime time since the 
1987-88 season. 
</P>
<P>
Sagansky replaces Kim LeMasters, who resigned Nov. 30 after two years in the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted that Jeff Sagansky will be joining CBS," said Howard Stringer, 
president, CBS/Broadcast Group. "He has earned the respect and admiration of 
the Hollywood entertainment community. He brings to our entertainment division 
not only a clarity of vision but a combination of creative and organizational 
skills that will prove invaluable to the company." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made jointly by Stringer and Alan J. Levine, head of the 
filmed entertainment group of Columbia Pictures Entertainment, the parent 
company of Tri-Star, which released Sagansky from the remaining year of his 
contract so he could accept the CBS post. 
</P>
<P>
Sagansky developed and oversaw a variety of successful films for Tri-Star 
including "Peggy Sue Got Married," "Like Father, Like Son" and the current 
releases, "Look Who's Talking," "Steel Magnolias" and "Glory." 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Tri-Star in 1985 Sagansky was senior vice president of series 
programming at NBC for two years, where he was involved in developing such 
series as "St. Elsewhere," "Cheers," "The Cosby Show," "Miami Vice," "The 
A-Team" and "Family Ties."

<P>
A hearing was scheduled this afternoon in federal bankruptcy court here.

The sale of slots at Chicago's O'Hare and New York's LaGuardia would provide 
Braniff an estimated $400,000, about a week's worth of cash, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
That sum, in addition to about $1.3 million on hand, would give Braniff roughly 
one month's operating expenses.

Prominent Wall Street stock speculator Salim B. (Sandy) Lewis was sentenced 
today to three years' probation and fined $250,000 after pleading guilty to 
manipulating the price of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe told Lewis she spared him a prison term 
and sentenced him to work in a drug rehabilitation clinic because "your skills 
should not be wasted." 
</P>
<P>
Lowe fined S. B. Lewis &amp; Co., the firm founded by Lewis, a total of 
$400,000 on two counts of falsifying records and violating securities margin 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing of Lewis was the latest in a series for securities industry 
figures implicated in wrongdoing as an outgrowth of the Ivan Boesky insider 
trading scandal. Lewis' punishment was among the lightest meted out so far. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 50, faced up to 15 years in prison and a fine of $750,000.

He still must settle related charges with the Securities and Exchange

East Germany's wall of Stalinist prudery fell today as the first editions of

The glossy girlie magazines stood out among a new selection of West German 
newspapers and weeklies the exclusive Grand Hotel has started importing from 
West Berlin.

A strict ban on racy publications was one of the pillars of communist 
asceticism that East Germany's disgraced former leaders imposed on the people 
while they themselves lived in luxury homes.

<P>
But the democratic upheaval shaking the country has swept away much of the old 
system, including a bureau controlling the import of Western publications. It

Marriott Corp. today announced a major restructuring, including the sale of its 
fast food and family restaurant businesses, in an effort to reposition the 
company for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said that it has completed the sale of its airline catering 
division to a group of senior managers for $570 million. That sale was expected 
to yield more than $200 million for Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
"As we move into the 1990s, we want to sharpen Marriott's focus on mega-markets 
in lodging and contract services which together have an estimated aggregate 
potential of more than $400 billion in industry annual sales," J. W. Marriott 
Jr., chairman and president, said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the restructuring will help the company to grow at 15% to 20% per 
year from our 1989 profit base for continuing operations," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the sale of 358 company-operated Roy Rogers fast food 
restaurants in the Middle Atlantic states in the first quarter of 1990. Those 
stores were expected to register about $400 million in sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott also said it intends to sell the 434 units operated by its family 
restaurants division, including 235 Bob's Big Boys, 79 Wags, 31 Bickfords, 57 
Howard Johnsons and 32 Allies restaurants. In total, these restaurants had 1989 
anticipated sales of about $440 million.

The company also announced it has repurchased 32 million shares, or 24%, of its 
common stock over the last three years, leaving 104 million outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott said one of the company's key objectives is to be a leader in each of 
its segments. 
</P>
<P>
"We have concluded that it is unrealistic for us to continue to pursue this 
goal in 'stand-alone' restaurants," Marriott said. 
</P>
<P>
"In fast food, we have a strong regional concept in a highly competitive 
segment dominated by a handful of national chains. In the family restaurant 
segment, competitive conditions have changed significantly within the past 
year, and we believe it now is too difficult . . . to become number one," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The company, headquartered in suburban Bethesda, Md., expects to record pretax 
restructuring charges and write-offs of between $225 million and $250 million 
on continuing operations in the fourth quarter of this year.

O.C.-BASED GROUP'S HOME DRUG TESTS SPARK DEBATE

<P>
The war on drugs is turning into a battle of credibility for the promoters of a 
do-it-yourself eye test that some of the nation's leading medical experts say 
is useless in helping parents ferret out drug abuse on the home front. 
</P>
<P>
Since its introduction more than a year ago, the "Winners Program" kit marketed 
by Athletes for a Strong America has become the center of a debate over whether 
it is an effective tool or a gimmick to make a buck off the country's alarm 
about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In August, a federal judge in Colorado deemed the eye test extremely 
inaccurate. A month later, prominent doctors and researchers cut through the 
exam's glowing testimonials from sports figures and concluded that the $49 kit 
was almost worthless. Family counselors too have joined the fray, saying the 
weekly regimen of home testing could destroy trust between parent and child. 
</P>
<P>
"The wholesale use of the eye test needs to be evaluated very carefully," said 
Dr. Don Catlin, a UCLA professor of medicine, who directed drug testing for 
athletes in the 1984 Olympic Games. "I am concerned about this product and 
other products that go out on the market in an attempt to diagnose things." 
</P>
<P>
But Athletes for a Strong America, a nonprofit organization based in Mission 
Viejo, is undaunted by its critics. The group's directors say that the kit, 
with its handy penlight and tips on drug prevention, is a trust builder in the 
family and the best available tool to screen children for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Our critics don't see enough addicts to put in a thimble," said Dr. Forest 
Tennant, a drug adviser to the National Football League, who helped adapt the 
eye examination for the home. "If people don't start learning how to recognize 
drug use and get people off drugs by using this test, I don't think we have any 
choice but to legalize drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant, a former mayor of West Covina and the owner of a string of drug 
treatment clinics in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Fresno, developed the test 
for home use more than 14 months ago at the urging of Athletes for a Strong 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, support for the organization has come from more than 100 of the 
nation's professional and college sports figures, including Los Angeles Dodgers 
manager Tommy Lasorda, Los Angeles Rams head coach John Robinson, former Green 
Bay Packers quarterback Bart Starr and Denver Broncos head coach Dan Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
Besides a penlight, the kit contains a scale for measuring pupil size, an 
instructional videotape and a 32-page manual to teach parents how to recognize 
and prevent drug use. It also contains tips on how to maintain a child's 
self-esteem. The program, which has been revised, expanded and renamed several 
times, is now called the "Super Deluxe Winner's Kit." 
</P>
<P>
A key part of the program, however, is an eye test similar to that used by law 
enforcement officers during field sobriety tests. It takes no more than a 
minute or two. 
</P>
<P>
During the exam, parents check for redness, puffiness and excessive tearing. 
Next, pupils are checked for dilation or constriction and whether they react 
properly to light. Finally, the eyes are observed for involuntary jerking and 
the inability to focus on an object coming toward them. 
</P>
<P>
If drug use is suspected, the kit recommends that urinalysis can be done at 
Tennant's Community Health Projects Medical Group, which owns 25 drug and 
alcohol clinics. Urine tests can cost up to $100. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant and David Hannah, president of Athletes for a Strong America, hope the 
eye check will become as commonplace as the toothbrush or thermometer. To 
institutionalize the technique in the family, they suggest that parents start 
the test when their children are about 7 years old, and administer it every few 
days from then on as a deterrent and detection device. 
</P>
<P>
Although much of the group's activity is in Southern California, colleges, 
school districts and businesses in several states have adopted the test. The 
promoters also have appeared on radio and television talk shows across the 
country, and Hannah estimates that the group has sold kits to about 10,000 
families in the Southland alone and made enough money to cover its overhead. 
</P>
<P>
"We are struggling with a tremendous drug problem," Hannah said, "and the eye 
test is the best method we've got. As a screening tool, it can be tremendously 
helpful. If there is a better deterrent you can give to parents, I want it." 
</P>
<P>
But a group of ophthalmologists, pharmacologists, medical researchers, and 
sports medicine experts at UCLA Medical Center and the University of Iowa are 
not convinced. They became concerned about the eye test last summer after the 
media reported that the device, then marketed under the name "Rapid Eye Check 
Kit," was being sold for home use. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the group from UCLA also said they were worried that Bruins head 
football coach Terry Donahue, who was co-chairman of Athletes for a Strong 
America, was lending his name and the university's reputation to something they 
thought didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the eye test and the kit's videotape, the doctors contacted the 
news media about their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA physicians said in interviews with The Times that the home test is based 
on some medical fallacies about the eye's reaction to drugs. Research by Dr. 
Robert Hepler at UCLA, for example, shows that marijuana has very little if any 
impact on the pupil -- a result that prompted warnings to law enforcement about 
using eye tests in the field as a basis for marijuana arrests. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, heroin constricts the pupils, while cocaine can have the 
opposite effect in large doses. But, the UCLA doctors said, it is unknown 
whether low and moderate doses of cocaine consistently change the eye in ways 
that can be measured by the home drug test. 
</P>
<P>
More important, they said, many eye conditions indicative of drug use, such as 
jerky motions while following an object, dilated or constricted pupils, the 
inability to focus on an object inches from the face, frequently occur for 
reasons unrelated to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, the group concluded that the test will be highly inaccurate in 
the hands of parents and could cost families thousands of dollars for 
unnecessary urine tests. They said many symptoms of drug use are readily 
noticeable without the home drug test, and that parents would be better off 
consulting their family doctors if drug use is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us get upset in these witch-hunt days," said Dr. Robert N. Pechnick, 
an assistant professor of pharmacology, who teaches drug abuse classes at UCLA. 
"The scientific community must take action to see that something that doesn't 
work doesn't get promoted." 
</P>
<P>
During the review, the UCLA group asked Dr. Stanley Thompson, a widely known 
pupil expert at the University of Iowa, to further evaluate the kit. Thompson 
and four other neuro-ophthalmologists agreed with UCLA's conclusions. 
Ophthalmologists at USC and Dr. Irving Leopold, a retired UC Irvine professor 
and an expert on the effect of drugs on the eye, had similar concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to us that the pupil test is a sham and the flashlight is just 
something for parents to wave about in the hope of scaring their kids into 
staying clean," Thompson wrote to UCLA in October. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Donahue, who appeared in the kit's videotape, has dropped out of Athletes 
for a Strong America. He declined to comment on the reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing we in the substance abuse field need are Oliver North-type 
loose cannons rattling around," said Dr. J. Thomas Ungerleider, a UCLA 
psychiatry professor and former presidential appointee to the National 
Committee on Marijuana and Drug Abuse during the Nixon Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant and Hannah, who say they never have been confronted with UCLA's 
concerns, defend the test, saying the physicians and researchers are ignorant 
about the program and its successes. It was never meant, they say, to be the 
sole criterion for suspected drug use and must be combined with more accurate 
urine testing. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant pointed out that it is common knowledge among law enforcement 
officials, drug treatment experts and medical professionals that drugs 
frequently affect the eyes in ways that can be easily detected with a little 
training. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be a whiz kid to do the test," said Tennant, who has run 
drug abuse clinics for almost 20 years. "I want these people at UCLA to tell me 
about their drug clinics, and how many people they examine that have eye signs. 
The eye test works, and if you are a parent and you don't have it, you have 
given your child another chance to get on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Athletes for a Strong America claims that if done properly, the eye test can 
detect drug use 80% to 90% of the time. Tennant said that has been his 
experience testing drug users at his clinics as well as that of law enforcement 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the test were inaccurate, Hannah says, the screening regimen gives 
children an excuse to stay off drugs. He added that parents are wrong if they 
think they can detect drug use by merely watching for falling grades, changes 
in behavior and undesirable friends. By then, he says, it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Tennant's and Hannah's accuracy claims, an August court decision in 
a civil rights lawsuit challenged the credibility and reliability of the eye 
test, which was given thousands of times to University of Colorado athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleged that the athletic department's drug testing program, which 
included the eye test used by Athletes for a Strong America, was 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Joseph Bellipanni, armed with the university's own 
statistics about the test, concluded that the examination falsely indicated 
drug use 97% to 98% of the time. Medical experts said the tests are also 
capable of yielding false negative results -- failing to detect actual drug 
use. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiff in that case, David Derdeyn, a former University of Colorado 
track team member who now lives in Hollywood, flunked the eye test, qualifying 
him to take a urine test, which later detected no drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing has Orwellian overtones and a terrible potential for abuse," said 
Derdeyn, who described the eye test as "kind of hokey" and "voodoo science." 
</P>
<P>
Similar inaccuracy rates were reported at Youngstown State University in Ohio, 
where trainer Dan Wathen estimated that 80% to 90% of athletes fail the test 
although they haven't taken drugs. Nevertheless, Wathen said he considered the 
eye exam useful for screening. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant and Hannah contend that University of Colorado trainers improperly 
flunked athletes for failing one part of the test instead of at least two 
portions as required. Court testimony indicated otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Colorado lawsuit is under appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Besides questions about accuracy, family counselors and others in the drug 
abuse field contend that home testing can undermine the trust between parent 
and child during the already trying time of adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
They say the exam could bring a heavy-handed, police atmosphere into the house 
if parents insist on testing children who are not using drugs and should be 
suspicion-free. 
</P>
<P>
"To create a situation where the parent is playing detective with teens might 
fuel resentment and anxiety," said UCLA Assistant Prof. Tom Kennon, a family 
counselor. "Overcontrol could have a reverse effect and widen the gap between 
parent and child." 
</P>
<P>
Naomi Siegal, a licensed clinical social worker in Los Angeles who deals with 
family problems, said approaching an adolescent with a home drug test is bound 
to threaten an already difficult stage in the parent-child relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"During adolescence, there is experimentation and rebellion," said Siegal, 
former director of psychiatric social work at St. John's Hospital in Santa 
Monica. "If you have a heavy-handed and authoritarian kind of practice, it 
could really give the kid something to rebel against." 
</P>
<P>
But Hannah and Tennant say trust is not an issue. Parents routinely check the 
whereabouts, health and appearance of their children, so adding another check 
won't matter, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"I test my son, and his eyes respond pretty well," Hannah said. "I have come to 
realize that this is actually a trust builder in the home and brings out better 
communication. Kids and parents feel comfortable with it." 
</P>
<P>
As proof, Hannah said, a survey by Athletes for a Strong America found that 
only six of 400 parents felt they could not give their children the eye test. 
If the test is given in a caring, understanding way, there should be no 
problem, Hannah said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some parents remain skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"From a medical standpoint it is not functional, and as a parent I'd be 
ill-advised to use it," said Dawn Ahart, a registered nurse and chairwoman of 
Orange County Parents Against Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Ahart said the group did not endorse the technique because the membership was 
afraid of a high inaccuracy rate. When members of Parents Against Drug Abuse 
got a look at the kit for the first time a while ago, "some of them laughed," 
Ahart said.

AIRPORT CHOICE: Portreros Los Pinos, a high plateau in the Cleveland National 
Forest near Ortega Highway, will be a coalition group's top recommendation for 
a new regional airport, sources say. . . . The site -- one of four to be 
offered to the Board of Supervisors soon after the first of the year -- would 
be the most accessible to the majority of Orange County residents. The group's 
second choice will be South Camp Pendleton in San Diego County. . . . Even an 
expanded John Wayne Airport will be seriously overmatched by the air traffic 
over Orange County in the 1990s. Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky

AREA CODE: In two years, when a big chunk of Los Angeles area code 213 gets a

the new area. . . . Even though the 714 area has not reached capacity -- and 
won't for at least a few more years -- company jurisdictions and switching 
complications will keep the three cities from joining the rest of Orange

STREET SMART: SEAT-BELT OFFENSE NOT THE SAME AS A MOVING VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I was very shocked recently when I received a traffic ticket. I was stopped by 
a patrolman, and he said, "You're going a little bit fast," and I said, "I 
didn't think that I was." And he said, "Well, you're not wearing your seat 
belt," which I wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
He said, "I'll have to cite you for your seat belt." So he gave me a citation, 
which carries a $25 fine. I thought, OK, they need the money. So I sent in the 
$25. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until a year later that I received a bill from my insurance company 
showing that the seat-belt citation raised my rate almost $100. I called them 
and they told me that a ticket for not wearing your seat belt is a moving 
violation and counts against your driving record. 
</P>
<P>
So for the next three years I will be paying about $100 more a year on my 
insurance because of that seat-belt violation. I think that fact should be 
published so people are aware of that. I had no idea that it would be a moving 
violation ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Frances Carey 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
Shame on your insurance company. They didn't tell the whole truth. 
</P>
<P>
A seat-belt violation isn't a moving violation, and it does not count a point 
on your official driving record with the state, according to Gina McGuiness, a 
Sacramento spokeswoman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, some insurance companies seem to be raising rates these days no 
matter what the violation. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem may lie with the DMV computer printouts of driver records, 
which insurance agencies use to determine how much they charge clients. For 
basic bookkeeping purposes, the printouts list all traffic citations, 
everything short of parking in a red zone. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the printouts don't indicate whether a citation is a moving 
violation or something less serious -- like a ticket for driving without a seat 
belt. It is left up to each insurance firm to check the severity of a ticket, 
and some probably don't even bother. 
</P>
<P>
Hope is in sight. The DMV is developing a new "user-friendly" printout that 
will specifically identify "in good plain English" which tickets are moving 
violations, McGuiness said. The new system is expected to be in place next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But even that improvement will do nothing to keep some insurers from hiking 
rates at the first sign of even the lowliest traffic citation. Motorists who 
suffer such a fate might consider asking the firm to call the DMV in Sacramento 
for clarification. If they still insist your rate should be hiked, you might 
consider shopping for a new insurer with less strict rules. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I read with interest the letter of James Hyek (Nov. 27) and your encouraging 
reply regarding the problem existing at the notorious bottleneck of the 
eastbound Garden Grove Freeway to the Orange and Santa Ana freeways. 
</P>
<P>
There is a similar problem at the junction of the Costa Mesa and Garden Grove 
freeways. The northbound exit from the Costa Mesa Freeway onto the westbound 
Garden Grove Freeway lacks any sort of ample exit lane. Anyone so unfortunate 
as to travel northbound on the Costa Mesa Freeway, at a snail's pace of course, 
is condemned to crawl in traffic the entire distance from 17th Street to the 
Garden Grove Freeway before an exit ramp finally appears. 
</P>
<P>
On many other freeways, special extra lanes are provided well in advance so a 
motorist can pull out of the traffic and head to an exit ramp hundreds of yards 
up the freeway. Ample room exists to do the same thing along the northbound 
Costa Mesa Freeway and provide motorists with an escape route to get to the 
westbound Garden Grove Freeway. But the land is simply left covered with ice 
plant, Caltrans' favorite. 
</P>
<P>
It would stand to reason that if a substantial number of cars left the Costa 
Mesa Freeway even sooner to head west, it would only be a welcome relief to all 
the through traffic continuing north. Let me guess the possible replies: "Not a 
Caltrans priority," "Proposition M defeated," or some such thing. 
</P>
<P>
John P. Lejeune 
</P>
<P>
Orange 
</P>
<P>
Now, now. Sounds like you already know all the answers. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials say they would like to see just such a special escape lane 
laid down on the northbound Costa Mesa Freeway to funnel off cars heading west 
on the Garden Grove Freeway. Just as you suggest, these sorts of extra lanes, 
which are separated from the regular freeway traffic by thick white lines known 
as "elephant track," help to clear out motorists from the regular through lanes 
of a freeway. 
</P>
<P>
While such a lane has already been designed, construction has been delayed 
because of funding problems, a common refrain at Caltrans these days. Maybe it 
will be built in 1991, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, the extra lane will siphon off traffic only about 2,000 feet before 
the exit ramp onto the westbound Garden Grove Freeway, not all the way from the 
17th Street exit further to the south. The reason, Caltrans officials say, is 
that the freeway cuts under a highway bridge at Santa Clara Avenue that is too 
narrow to permit the extra lane.

NOT A WET BLANKET PRESENT AS PARTY-GOERS TAKE A DIVE

SANTA CATALINA ISLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Keyes met Santa Claus on Saturday -- on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
But when the 28-year-old Anaheim diver swam up to claim her Christmas present, 
Santa didn't give her anything from his soggy bag of goodies. 
</P>
<P>
"He said my hands were too full," Keyes, a computer instructor, lamented 
afterwards. "I had a camera in one hand and I was trying to take pictures of 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Keyes was participating in one of Southern California's more unusual yuletide 
celebrations. She accompanied 24 other divers Saturday who raised a Christmas 
tree and received gifts from Santa in the chilly waters off Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Santa Claus Dive" has been an annual ritual of the Los Angeles 
chapter of the Underwater Photographic Society for much of the chapter's 
32-year history. The tradition, little-known even among many local divers, is 
also observed by a handful of other Southland scuba clubs and shops. 
</P>
<P>
Sea D Sea, a dive shop in Redondo Beach, for example, has been sponsoring a 
Christmas dive every December for the past 20 years, shop owner Barry Friedman 
said. This year's Sea D Sea dive drew a full boat of 35 divers, including Ed 
Mandich of Rancho Santa Margarita and his two brothers, Steve and Jerry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun," said Steve Mandich, 32, a mortgage banker from San Pedro who has 
joined his brothers in Christmas dives for the past 12 years. "The owner of the 
shop dresses up like Santa Claus and we all have a big barbecue." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's dive by the underwater photographers drew novices and veterans 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
"To us, it's pretty normal, but every time we tell someone else they think it's 
abnormal," said Mark Dell'Aquila, 27, of Manhattan Beach, president of the 
underwater club's local chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Hamusek, 45, a first-time Christmas diver from Lynwood, said she signed 
up because she thought it would be a serene experience. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a nice, calm way to celebrate Christmas, unlike going to the 
malls," said Hamusek, a nurse who belongs to South Coast Divers, a South Bay 
scuba club. 
</P>
<P>
The divers rendezvoused at daybreak on a San Pedro dock, where the 78-foot dive 
boat Charisma awaited them for the two-hour cruise to Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
They brought with them two small boxes; one containing a collapsible, plastic 
Christmas tree with silver and gold garlands, and the other a red and white 
Santa Claus suit with a white beard made, appropriately from a mop. 
</P>
<P>
En route to the island, veterans of past Christmas dives swapped stories. Dick 
Turner, a 43-year-old engineer from La Canada, for instance, was marveling at 
how nice the weather was Saturday. Two years ago, he recalled, the underwater 
Christmas celebration had to be scrubbed because of rough waters. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Wicksten, a marine biology professor at Texas A &amp; M who travels all 
the way from her home in College Station for the dives, laughingly recalled the 
odd reception that the event receives from other divers. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we were pushing the Christmas tree through the kelp beds and people 
passing in other dive boats just looked at us like: 'What are you doing?,' " 
said Wicksten, a former San Pedro resident. "But that was nothing compared to 
the way the fish were looking at the tree. Apparently, the fish thought we were 
crazy, too." 
</P>
<P>
With the Charisma anchored in 30 feet of aquamarine water in the Isthmus Cove 
off northeastern Catalina, the divers set about locating a smooth, level place 
upon which the tree could rest. That done, they assembled the tree aboard the 
boat, lowered it into the sea, and swam it down to its chosen location, 
anchoring the tree's round, wooden base with divers' weight belts. 
</P>
<P>
The role of Santa Claus this year fell to Dell'Aquila, who said he would have 
preferred to take pictures. Grudgingly, he suited up, strapping on the scraggly 
white beard and wrestling an ill-fitting Santa costume over his diving suit. 
Then he held his nose and jumped boots-first into the 60-degree water. 
</P>
<P>
Santa, without Rudolph, had a little trouble finding his target. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the tree?," he said patiently at first. Then, "Where the hell's the 
tree?" 
</P>
<P>
Charisma skipper John Hess gestured in the direction of a concentration of air 
bubbles, which marked the spot where the other divers were gathered. Within 
minutes, Santa had moved into position, perching on a ledge next to the 
six-foot tree and receiving fellow divers on his lap. 
</P>
<P>
He spent the next 20 minutes handing out gifts -- liquor bottles wrapped in 
foil, for the most part -- and posing for pictures as the diver-photographers 
swarmed around with cameras and video recorders. Orange-colored garibaldis, 
California's protected state fish, darted in and out of yellow beds of kelp. 
</P>
<P>
Back topside, Dell'Aquila was roundly praised as he squirmed out of the Santa 
suit and the tree was disassembled. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good Santa Claus," allowed Cory Gray, a Culver City engineer and club 
membership chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Keyes, who learned to dive only a year ago, was left with a warm 
impression -- despite having failed to receive her present. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll have another one next year," Keyes said as the divers toasted from 
bottles of wine on their return to shore. "We'll make it even better than 
this."

YOUTH HOME GIVES TEENS NEW HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chad was 13 years old, he says, when his mother told him to find somewhere else 
to live. 
</P>
<P>
"Her boyfriend told her to pick: him or me. She chose him," said Chad, now 15 
and a two-year veteran of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Chad's life took a turn for the better a few weeks ago when he arrived at Casa 
Youth Shelter, the largest of Orange County's three shelters for troubled 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"Every week this place changes -- we handle over 400 kids a year," said Luciann 
Maulhardt, director of the Los Alamitos shelter. "Every day a new one might 
come in. You never know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the teens stay about two weeks while they try to work things out with 
their families or find somewhere else to live. During their stay, residents 
attend group counseling twice a day, individual counseling as needed and family 
counseling once a week when possible. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the residents feel helpless when they get here; they feel that they 
don't have the power to change their lives," Maulhardt said. "In counseling, we 
work to change that attitude. We try to show them that they can change their 
lives for the better. Anyone can." 
</P>
<P>
Life in the shelter, residents admit, can be tough. They do chores, make phone 
calls with supervision only, and must ask permission to smoke, use appliances, 
go to the kitchen, watch television or leave the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
But the house rules, along with the support of their peers, the counseling, the 
art program, the merit and demerit system, give structure to their lives and 
help the teen-agers heal and move forward, Maulhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave up a lot of freedom when I came here," Chad said. "You know, I lived on 
my own for two years -- I did anything I wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's not the most important thing now. I'm alive. I'm off drugs. I at 
least have a chance now. The way things were looking, I don't think I would 
have lasted much longer on the streets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter can house up to 12 teen-agers at a time. A few are permanent 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
"People should be really happy that we're here instead of at home being abused 
or neglected," said Isaac, 15, who has been a ward of the state for four years. 
"We're lucky to be away from the people who make our lives terrible. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never really had a fun Christmas at home anyway," he said. "Christmas was 
just like an ordinary day at home -- nothing special." 
</P>
<P>
At Casa, a big Christmas party is planned, and Isaac says he expects to get 
just what he wants: "a lot of clothes." He and Denise, the other permanent 
resident, will open gifts and share the holiday with whoever happens to land 
there that day. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it gets kind of lonely, celebrating Christmas in places like this, 
because you wish you were at home with family," Isaac said. "But then you 
realize it's not so bad. The people here are just like family, they are my 
family. And we have more fun here than I ever did at home," he said. MICHELLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Antonio Valle Jr. is the new president of the La Habra Board of Education, 
succeeding Nancy S. Zinberg, who was named vice president for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy deserves a lot of credit for the parenting goal that has been 
established for the district," said Supt. Rich Hermann. Zinberg has served 10 
years on the board and the 1989 term was her second as president. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Supt. Ruth Fehr said that Zinberg "does whatever she can to ensure 
quality education for every student in the district." 
</P>
<P>
Valle was elected to the board in 1980 and begins his second stint as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a hard-working board member; he is around the schools and he is around 
the community," Hermann said. "He's a valuable resource to the district."

HARBOR GLOWS FOR 81ST YEAR OF BOAT PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He has taken top honors for eight of the last nine years. And Bobby Cornelius 
of Lido Island admits that, when it comes to the array of lights and 
decorations that mark the Newport Harbor Christmas Boat parade, he is "the bad 
guy everyone else wants to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Cornelius, a 59-year-old developer, was so intent this year on keeping his 
dynasty intact that he spent about $5,000 to adorn his 120-foot yacht, and even 
kept his boat hidden in Huntington Harbour for a while to discourage spies. 
</P>
<P>
But finally on Sunday night, he cruised down the harbor as the parade opened 
its seven-night run for the 81st consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's spectacular," Cornelius said of the holiday event. "The parade is such a 
fun thing to do. All the kids get such a big kick out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of children and adults, fighting the traffic and parking crunch that 
come with the event, got a glimpse of the parade Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what the holiday is all about around here," said Jill Moss of Balboa, 
as she watched the cavalcade of more than 100 boats with her children and other 
family members. "It's a great chance to get into the Christmas spirit and all 
that, and to see who can do outdo who in the decorations." 
</P>
<P>
Others seemed less pleased, however. 
</P>
<P>
After years of cajoling, Sylvia Miller of Mission Viejo finally persuaded her 
husband to make the trek to the parade. But once there, neither thought it was 
worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really impressed at all," Jack Miller said as the boats began to pass 
by at the outset of the parade. "I love boats and all, but I don't see anything 
so far to make it worth driving through all this traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials could give no immediate estimate of the turnout. But 
in past years, organizers say, the event has drawn up to 250,000 spectators 
nightly, and longtime harbor observers said this year's parade seemed off to a 
favorable start. 
</P>
<P>
Among those enjoying the festivities were local merchants. As the event has 
grown in recent years into a major tourist attraction, thousands of people and 
millions of dollars are drawn into waterfront stores, restaurants and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
At Newport Landing Sportfishing, for instance, office manager Pam Watts was 
kept busy Sunday night readying chartered boats for some 400 people who wanted 
an on-the-water view of the parade. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely important time for us," Watts said. "Having the Christmas 
parade rush gets us through the rest of the winter." 
</P>
<P>
The event, launched on July 4, 1908, has become no less important for the 
boating enthusiasts who participate. 
</P>
<P>
The procession of yachts cruising around Newport Harbor, adorned with thousands 
of lights, giant balloons and animated features, has drawn parade-watchers from 
as far away as Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Winners of the boat-decoration competition have only plaques to take home with 
them. But the lure of the big prize has nonetheless reportedly driven boat 
owners to spend thousands of dollars in preparing their vessels, which will be 
judged later in the week, according to Richard R. Luehrs, president of the 
Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce, the parade sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
"There are engineers and draft people to design the boat decorations. There are 
the materials and the generators to buy," Luehrs pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
Perennial winner Cornelius, for instance, this year extended his 120-foot 
Crystal Kona Hawaii into a 300-foot, floating extravaganza by adding a sleigh 
and reindeer, a manger scene, and three skiffs carrying a trio of wise men and 
camels. The boat is lighted by more than 5,000 lights and adorned with a 
22-foot-high Santa Claus and two giant snowmen. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he took home top honors when he cruised into the harbor with a Santa 
Claus atop a propane-fired rocket that shot out real flames. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing like it anywhere in the world," Luehrs boasts of the annual 
parade. "Where else could you watch million-dollar yachts cruise by John 
Wayne's house, decked out in thousands of dollars worth of lights?" ERIC 
LICHTBLAU

RESTAURANT IN PARK WILL BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city-owned, hilltop restaurant with a 270-degree panoramic view of Orange 
County and the Pacific Ocean could sit atop a public park in the East Coyote 
Hills next year. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will hold a public hearing Tuesday afternoon to consider plans 
for the restaurant and the layout of the proposed 11-acre Vista Park. The 
restaurant would be built on the highest portion of the park, about 40 feet 
above the intersection of State College Boulevard and Bastanchury Road. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the park's design have been tentatively approved by several city 
commissions, but the design of the proposed 438-seat restaurant has been a 
sticking point among city officials and residents. 
</P>
<P>
In separate meetings this month, the Planning Commission and the Redevelopment 
Design Review Committee said the proposed 38-foot-high restaurant was too 
massive. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim-based Summit Restaurant Co. then scaled down plans for its English 
country-style restaurant and on Tuesday will bring council members sketches for 
a 30-foot-high building. 
</P>
<P>
Summit has a lease with the city to build and operate the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to design something that will satisfy the citizens of Fullerton 
and also create a building that will be a focal point of the community," said 
Gary Parkinson, a partner of Summit in the Catch Restaurant in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
But an English-style restaurant isn't what some Fullerton residents want to see 
as the focal point of the park. 
</P>
<P>
"It will look like an English mansion," said Miriam E. Sheddon, member of a 
resident's group called the Coyote Hills Committee. "That doesn't go with a 
park; it stands out." 
</P>
<P>
The Coyote Hills Committee, which has about 15 members, wants to see the 
planned restaurant blend in more naturally with the park's design. 
</P>
<P>
According to the city's plans, landscaping for the park will consist of 
drought-tolerant plants requiring little irrigation and maintenance. TOM

JAMBOREE RAMP TO I-405 WILL CLOSE FOR ROADWORK 
</P>

<P>
Drivers heading south on Jamboree Boulevard today will find the entrance to the 
northbound San Diego Freeway closed for construction. 
</P>
<P>
The ramp will remain closed until late January as work continues on the San 
Diego Freeway widening project. 
</P>
<P>
However, the other Jamboree entrance to the northbound San Diego Freeway, which 
had been closed since late November to drivers heading north on Jamboree, will 
reopen today. 
</P>
<P>
Other openings and closures of Jamboree-San Diego Freeway interchange ramps 
include: 
</P>
<P>
* The reopening of the northbound San Diego Freeway off-ramp to Jamboree on 
Tuesday. It has been closed since late November. 
</P>
<P>
* The northbound Jamboree on-ramp to the southbound San Diego Freeway will 
remain closed until Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
* The southbound Jamboree on-ramp to the southbound San Diego Freeway, which is 
open, will close in early January for most of the month. 
</P>
<P>
The widening project will add car-pool lanes in both directions of the San 
Diego Freeway through the county and is scheduled to be completed by April, 
Caltrans spokesman Albert Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
The work is part of the project's second phase, from the Corona del Mar Freeway 
to the Santa Ana Freeway, Miranda said. Caltrans finished the first phase of 
the project, from the Corona del Mar Freeway to the San Gabriel Freeway, in 
August. LEN HALL

Record-setting defensive back Tim Manning of Trabuco Hills High School was 
named Orange County's back of the year and Oscar Wilson of Santa Ana was 
selected lineman of the year on Sunday at the 30th Times' awards brunch at the 
Anaheim Hilton and Towers. 
</P>
<P>
Manning intercepted 24 passes in three seasons, setting a county career record, 
and led Trabuco Hills to the Division VIII championship this year by passing 
for 17 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Manning started as a defensive back, wide receiver and quarterback during his 
standout career. He also was a starting guard on the school's basketball team 
that advanced to the state Division III championship game last March. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is the only player in 30 years to earn first-team honors for three 
consecutive seasons. He also became the only player selected as the lineman of 
the year for two years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Coach of the year honors went to Orange's first-year walk-on coach, Tom Meiss. 
Meiss led Orange to the Division VIII championship game, marking the first time 
the school had advanced to a football title game in 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
Orange had struggled to a 2-8 record in 1988, but Meiss led the Panthers to a 
10-3-1 record despite teaching at Santa Ana High. 
</P>
<P>
The Times honored 276 players from Southern California. Dennis Green, Stanford 
football coach, was the guest speaker.

PREP REVIEW;

<P>
NELSON IS BACK WITH LAGUNA HILLS . . FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pat Nelson said Sunday that he has rejoined the Laguna Hills High School 
basketball team after sitting out two games because of a dispute with Coach 
Dave Brown over playing time and productivity. 
</P>
<P>
But Nelson said he might not be with the Hawks for long. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, the team's leading scorer and only returning starter from last season, 
said he will be ready for the Hawks' game Tuesday at Estancia, but he is 
considering transferring to Pacific Coast League rival Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I will play in the Estancia game and see what's going on," said Nelson, a 
6-foot-4 senior forward who transferred from Estancia to Laguna Hills after his 
freshman year. "There are still a lot of problems between me and my coach. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless things work out in the Estancia game, I'm out of here." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who benched Nelson in the third quarter of a 55-50 loss to Estancia Dec. 
8, is in his first year at Laguna Beach after leading Fountain Valley to seven 
Sunset League titles in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who averaged 19 points in four games this season, quit the team and 
missed two games -- losses to Orange Lutheran and Corona del Mar in the Irvine 
World News Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I don't want to see this thing get too overblown," Brown said. "The 
basic idea was that offensively we wanted to make sure he understood the 
philosophy and how we wanted him to play. Hopefully, we have communicated that 
to him." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who has been nursing a sore ankle, said he doesn't fit into Brown's 
deliberate offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Laguna Hills isn't used to the way Brown coaches," Nelson said. "We usually 
like to run and shoot. It's more my style of play versus his style of play. 
It's a lack of communication." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson currently lives with his mother, Kathy, in Laguna Hills. He said he 
would move in with his father, Steve, in Santa Margarita if he decides to 
transfer to Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Weight a second: After tipping the scales at Savanna last season, Mustapha Abdi 
has been tipping in a few more shots this season with Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Abdi went on a diet last summer after transferring from Savanna to Huntington 
Beach, cutting his playing weight from 194 pounds to 183. 
</P>
<P>
"I cut back on all the sweets, the cakes and candy, all the good stuff," said 
Abdi, a 6-4 junior. "I'm much quicker and I move better on the floor. Last 
season, I couldn't run the floor very well." 
</P>
<P>
As Abdi's weight has decreased, his productivity has increased. He has averaged 
26 points and 16 rebounds for the Oilers (4-4). Last season, he averaged 17.7 
points and was the only sophomore named to The Times' All-County team. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Clark, Southern Section administrator, said the 1989 football playoffs 
were one of the most successful in the section's history in terms of 
attendance. The nine divisional championship games drew an estimated 80,000 
fans, the most since 1979, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good year," he said. "There's been a revival of interest in high 
school football and we had some great matchups in the finals." 
</P>
<P>
It's the time of year when college football coaches begin courting the top high 
school players in the nation, and Orange County players have been drawing 
plenty of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Hartwell Brown, a first-team all-county defensive lineman at Los Alamitos, is 
picking from a list that includes USC, UCLA, California, Stanford and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes said Brown's size (6-fee-4, 240 pounds) and 
Scholastic Aptitude Test scores (1,410 out of 1,600) appeal to recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said Nebraska recruiters noticed Brown while watching game film of Todd 
Gragnano, a second-team all-county selection at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"They said Brown was the best they had seen at his position in the nation," 
Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Gragnano is being recruited heavily by Nebraska and Big Eight champion 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama and Oregon are pursuing Mater Dei quarterback Danny O'Neil. The 
Monarchs' Ryan Motherway, a 6-4, 255-pound offensive lineman, has drawn 
interest from Cal, Stanford, UCLA and USC. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Henigan will resume his position as head football coach at Irvine High 
next year. Rick Curtis, who was a co-coach along with Henigan this season, will 
return as an assistant. Irvine experimented with co-head coaches the last two 
seasons and finished a combined 9-11. Henigan said he and Curtis decided at the 
end of the season to return to the traditional format. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis also will become the Irvine boys' golf coach this spring, replacing 
Craig Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Seckman, in his first season as Santa Margarita girls' basketball coach, 
had a hard time putting the Eagles' 48-44 upset of Gahr last Monday into 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
One can't blame Seckman, who moved to Santa Margarita from Wheeling, W.Va., 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he had to be informed what a big victory he had scored over Gahr, the 
4-AA's top-ranked team, in the opening round of the Brea-Olinda Lady Cat 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"That is what everybody was telling me," Seckman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles are 5-2 with a starting lineup of three sophomores and two juniors. 
The school opened two years ago and does not have a senior class.

BREA'S WILLIAMS MAKES RAPID RISE TO THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BREA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago, Jinelle Williams was a scared eighth-grader riding the pine 
for the Pole Cats, an elite developmental girls' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Williams had played virtually no organized basketball. She was only on the 
bench because Brea-Olinda High School Coach Mark Trakh had seen her in his 
junior high physical education class and recognized her athletic talent. He 
suggested that she play for the Pole Cats, a junior high team coached by 
history teacher Jon Joslin. 
</P>
<P>
Not that she actually was playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to play then," said Williams, who is now a junior and the 
leading scorer for Brea-Olinda, the defending Division III state champions. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be sitting on the bench watching the clock move and hoping time would 
run out so I wouldn't have to go in." 
</P>
<P>
Williams didn't want to play, because she didn't know how to play. To Williams, 
a stutter step could have meant a shoe with a twisted tongue. A travel? Isn't 
that something you do on vacation? A zone? Uh, you mean like the ozone layer or 
the Twilight Zone? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know at all what I was doing," Williams said. "I didn't know 
anything. One thing I'll always remember was three seconds. You know how you 
can't stay in the key? I thought it was on both offense and defense so I was 
jumping out of the key on defense." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Williams, she is a quick study. 
</P>
<P>
In her freshman year, she made an impression, starting on a junior varsity team 
that won 24 games and lost only to Mission Viejo's varsity team, which was 
ranked second in the county at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Williams made her mark. In her first season on the varsity, all 
she did was score 23 points in the Southern California Regional championship 
victory over Lemoore and 24 points in the state championship victory over 
Mercy. She also was a second-team all-state Division III selection. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Williams again is an impact player for top-ranked Brea. Two weeks 
ago she was named the most valuable player in the 16-team Irvine tournament 
that featured some of the county's top teams and players. 
</P>
<P>
"When she was voted MVP of the Irvine tournament, she got a huge hand (of 
applause)," Trakh said. "She is like a crowd favorite. People in Brea just love 
her." Williams also is the Wildcats' leading scorer, averaging 14 points a 
game. Quite an accomplishment considering she plays on an experienced team that 
includes senior point guard Aimee McDaniel, the state player of the year last 
year, and senior Tammy Blackburn, another guard who has signed to play at San 
Diego State in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Williams gets more opportunities to score because guards McDaniel and Blackburn 
try to feed her the ball. Nothing unusual there, because Williams is the team's 
center. What is unusual is that she can dominate as much as she does with her 
limited experience -- and her limited height. She is only 5-feet-8 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
"She is just a great athlete," Trakh said. "We almost saw her touch the rim the 
other day. She can really jump. She plays like she's 6 foot. She jumps over a 
lot of those kids and she is quick. She is a quick jumper. She is so fast she 
can beat a lot of those people down the court. She has to have an incredible 
time in the 40." 
</P>
<P>
Williams jumps well enough that her thoughts of dunking a basketball some day 
can't quite be categorized as fantasy, at least not to her face. 
</P>
<P>
"I am about an inch from (the rim)," she said. "My goal is to be able to dunk 
by my senior year. I want to score the winning basket on a dunk and break the 
backboard. 
</P>
<P>
"My freshman year I could touch the rubber on the bottom of the backboard. Last 
year, I got up there a little bit more." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who was once intimidated by the prospect of taking to the court for a 
few seconds, now loves the game so much that in the off-season she spends hours 
honing her game at Tamarack Park in Brea. That's where she perfects the moves 
that help her dominate taller centers. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Trakh shows us a lot of moves for different situations," Williams said. 
"We do them a lot as a warmup in practice and it just becomes routine. If you 
see that (situation), you just go ahead and do that move that he showed you. 
</P>
<P>
"I think many times I can score because I don't realize the (opposing centers) 
are there, and by the time I turn around, I am already up shooting so I don't 
have time to be intimidated too much." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' toughest test lies ahead in college where 5-8 centers usually get the 
best look at the brand name of the basketball -- as it is stuffed back down 
their throats. 
</P>
<P>
She is aware that she has to make the transition to play the wing in college. 
She doesn't start at wing for Brea despite the fact that there are taller 
players who could play center. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to be as strong a team if she plays outside," Trakh said. 
"And who does she replace outside? Jody (Anton)?, Tammy? Those people are 
better outside shooters. It's a balancing act. We have to look out for her 
future and, at the same time, we have to look out for the team, the high school 
and the rest of the kids, too. I think she has a better chance of getting a 
Division I-scholarship than if she did not play at all." 
</P>
<P>
Trakh has been working with Williams on her guard skills during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"She is a good enough athlete that she can teach herself," Trakh said. "She has 
a good attitude and a super personality and she is intelligent. She picks up 
things very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Williams is not too concerned with her impending transition to guard. "That 
seems like a long way away for me to think about," she said. "It's what, a year 
and a half away?" 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she's not only quick, she's a quick study.

1990 ORANGE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY'S ECONOMY WILL CONTINUE TO GROW IN THE NEXT DECADE, BUT AT A 
SLOWER PACE THAN IN THE 1980'S. THE COUNTY'S EMPLOYMENT BASE WILL CONTINE TO 
SHIFT TO SERVICES.; 
</P>
<P>
O.C. ECONOMY WILL SLOW SOME BUT IT SHOULD STAY ON THE GO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like a front-running racer who cuts the pace to conserve energy, Orange 
County's economy is expected to slow to a jog in the 1990s after nearly a 
decade of sprinting flat-out. 
</P>
<P>
But even a slow jogger covers a lot of ground. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the '90s, the economic landscape of Orange County will have 
undergone some profound changes. But things won't really look a lot different 
to the casual passer-by because the physical layout of the county has been 
well-established by past development. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the familiar facade will be a county in which white-collar office 
workers, engineers, computer programmers, bankers, consultants and executives 
far outnumber lunch bucket-toting machinists, carpenters, plumbers and 
drill-press operators. 
</P>
<P>
Many manufacturing companies that grew up here -- makers of machinery and 
industrial equipment, of spas and TV sets -- will relocate to places where land 
and labor costs are cheaper and environmental constraints and tax laws more 
hospitable. 
</P>
<P>
Acres and acres of the windowless concrete tilt-up buildings that housed those 
manufacturers in places like Garden Grove, Santa Ana, Orange and Anaheim will 
give way to offices and business parks devoted to cleaner, more 
service-oriented pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
Unless a national calamity should strike, Orange County's economy -- now 
10th-largest among counties nationwide and larger than many sizable countries 
-- will certainly get bigger, economists and business executives said. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the '90s, the county's gross product -- the value of all goods 
and services produced locally -- should be approaching $104 billion, up from 
$64 billion this year. And that is at an annual pace of 5%, half the growth 
rate of the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
The area's population is projected to grow by 262,000 to 2.6 million by the 
year 2000, spurring retail sales, fueling a demand for new housing and bringing 
a steady supply of both unskilled, foreign workers and highly educated 
professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Employment should grow by some 25,000 new jobs a year to a total of about 1.4 
million jobs by 1999. And because most of those employees will be hired into 
positions at the top end of the pay scale because of the need for highly 
trained technical and professional workers, the median annual family income in 
the county could grow from the current $49,916 to almost $90,000 by the end of 
the decade. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the county's economic engine will remain small business, the 
nearly 80,000 enterprises that make, market, sell, design, distribute and 
deliver everything from toilet valves to computer memory chips. 
</P>
<P>
John Galvin, vice chairman of the Irvine Co., the county's largest land owner 
and developer, said that while the '90s will be marked by a slower economy, the 
county still "is positioned to have spectacular economic growth. We should lead 
the rest of California." 
</P>
<P>
But from scores of interviews with regional economists and local business 
executives it is clear that the next decade will have some rough spots. Some of 
the more important trends that will effect Orange County include: 
</P>
<P>
* A decline in defense spending. This will mean a loss of aerospace and other 
defense-related jobs as international tensions ease and the federal government 
struggles to balance its budget. Defense contractors will grapple with 
"economic conversion," attempting to develop private-sector markets for their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
* Growth of the service sector. A drop in defense and other manufacturing jobs 
will be offset by increases in service jobs, which are expected to jump 26% in 
just the first half of the decade to about 373,000 jobs. The shift from an 
industrial to a service economy has been going on for most of the past two 
decades as land and housing costs, traffic congestion and air pollution and 
environmental control measures make the county too expensive for traditional 
manufacturing and for the lower-paid workers who support an industrial economy. 
</P>
<P>
* A construction slump. The pace of commercial and residential construction 
will lag well behind the frenetic pace of the past decade. Construction 
employment is expected to stagnate at just about 5% of the total jobs in the 
county. High vacancy rates will curb commercial building. High prices and 
overbuilding will pressure housing construction. 
</P>
<P>
* Slowing of housing appreciation rates. The average yearly appreciation of 
houses in the '90s will be below 10% annually, particularly in the early part 
of the decade. That is far below the 20% increase in values the county has seen 
the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
* Expansion of import-export opportunities. Orange County business will compete 
more in the international marketplace as Eastern Europe opens its borders, the 
Pacific Rim nations continue flexing their economic muscle and the major 
nations of Western Europe form a single market economy in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
* Greater environmental controls. Some businesses will be forced to leave 
Orange County because of stricter air pollution and toxic waste rules. Rules 
already proposed for the Southern California basin would place more than 100 
restrictions on oil companies, factories using paint and solvents, automobiles 
and other sources of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The major economic uncertainty in Orange County for the '90s is whether the 
U.S. economy can continue to move forward, avoiding a full-scale recession -- 
something many economists now think is possible. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of an all-encompassing slump, the economic scene of the '90s is likely 
to be marked by what Chapman College economist James Doti refers to as "rolling 
corrections" -- mini-recessions in individual industries, offset by the 
relative good health of the rest of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The deregulation of banking and other industries," Doti said, "has reduced the 
buildup of pressures that in the past were relieved by 
recessionary-inflationary cycles." 
</P>
<P>
The last decade saw the county solidify its position as a leading center of 
high technology and biomedical research and emerge on the cutting edge of the 
new industrial and information revolutions. 
</P>
<P>
But the pace at which the county has been developing is one that economists and 
business leaders say is practically impossible -- and, quite possibly, 
impractical -- to sustain. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s alone have seen median annual family income nearly double to $50,000; 
the creation of more than 300,000 new jobs and about 10,000 new businesses, and 
an almost 90% increase in the gross county product. 
</P>
<P>
That growth has put tremendous strain on Orange County's infrastructure, 
however, testing almost to the limits the county's ability to support the very 
business community that has helped make it a desirable place to live and work. 
</P>
<P>
The principal economic problems the county faces in the '90s -- upheaval in 
defense-related employment, a transportation system that barely works and 
soaring housing costs -- are not easy to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the county's business base is in its diversity and broad base 
of small businesses with few employees -- 96% have fewer than 50 workers and 
64% have no more than five. That diversity means that the business community 
can, and does, adjust rapidly to change. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the county likely will enter a period of slower growth tempered by major 
readjustments in aerospace, manufacturing and construction -- the so-called 
goods-producing sectors. Those industries carried the county to its current 
economic heights. 
</P>
<P>
The changes will be particularly dramatic in manufacturing, which in Orange 
County has never been marked by belching smokestacks and grime-encrusted 
workers trudging home from the factory. 
</P>
<P>
There has always been a small segment of heavy manufacturing in the county, but 
with the exception of the large aerospace companies that came here in the 1950s 
and still churn out rockets and radar systems, manufacturing in the county 
today is largely assembly of prefabricated components. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly in the '90s, manufacturing facilities will be research and 
development-oriented, employing 20 or 30 engineers and a handful of highly 
skilled specialists to turn out prototypes of the medical instruments, computer 
systems and other high-technology items they have designed. 
</P>
<P>
But the manufacturing companies dependent on defense spending are not expected 
to fare well in the county. A 15% drop in national defense spending by 1994 is 
estimated in a new long-range forecast prepared by Esmael Adibi, director of 
the Chapman College Center for Economic Research. 
</P>
<P>
Because Orange County manufacturers receive a disproportionately high 
percentage of the defense dollar -- about $4 billion of the $241 billion spent 
last year, Adibi says -- the decline will translate into substantial job 
losses. He predicts that aerospace employment, which now accounts for about 
96,000 jobs in the county, will drop to 88,000 jobs by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The ability of some major firms to convert to peacetime products could offset 
deep damage to the economy, but there will be a lot of disruption over the 
short term, Adibi predicts. 
</P>
<P>
In construction, employment will bounce up and down over the years because of 
changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
And as the county's available store of raw land continues to diminish, the bulk 
of the residential construction business will move into faster-growing areas, 
such as Riverside and San Bernardino counties, said Paul Whelan, a development 
consultant with the Meyers Group in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
Within Orange County, the trend increasingly will be to the development of 
multiple-family housing. More and more people will live in apartments for 
longer and longer periods -- by preference or through necessity as they try to 
save money to buy a home, said Earl Timmons, a recently retired development 
consultant and former Irvine Co. executive. 
</P>
<P>
And except for resales in older parts of the county, he said, the detached 
single-family home will be out of the price range of all but the wealthiest. 
The average price of a home in the county -- new and resale, condo and detached 
single-family combined -- is a hefty $246,000. But when only new detached 
single-family homes are counted, it rises to a staggering $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Housing Slowdown 
</P>
<P>
Because the county is still considered a desirable place to live, the 
population will continue to grow and demand for housing will continue to 
outstrip the supply, helping to prop up prices. Duplexes, townhouses and 
condominiums will be all that is available for middle-class new home buyers, 
Timmons said. 
</P>
<P>
That economic slowdown will affect Orange County housing price appreciation, 
however, with the 20% annual hikes common in the last years of the '80s 
dropping dramatically. In fact, in real terms when inflation is considered, 
housing prices in the county could deflate slightly next year, Doti projects. 
</P>
<P>
The growing population will also create demand for more retail development -- 
although the county likely has seen the end of major shopping mall 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. officials still insist that the proposed Irvine Center at the 
junction of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways will be built, but Timmons 
argues that the population of the county simply won't support another huge 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
With or without the Irvine project, other retail development likely will 
concentrate on specialty centers because that is the direction in which the 
retailing business is heading, industry specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the population growth and residential and retail construction 
will occur in the South County, the bulk of the commercial and industrial 
building activity will stay north of El Toro, principally in Irvine and the 
central core area of Anaheim, Orange, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa, predicted James 
Renzas, president of Location Management Services of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to commercial development in the south is transportation," said 
Michael Dorsey, head of the Grubb &amp; Ellis Co. commercial real estate office 
in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slow Going Ahead 
</P>
<P>
A number of improvements are expected to be made to the county's jammed-up 
transportation system during the decade, but they aren't expected to bring much 
relief to residents or business commuters anywhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The hope is simply that new traffic-control technologies, freeway widenings, 
monorails and other proposed mass transit systems will keep things from 
deteriorating further. 
</P>
<P>
An expanded John Wayne Airport will open sometime next year. Airport manager 
George Rebella predicts that the new terminal and a nearly 100% increase in 
flights, to an estimated 150 a day, won't be enough to meet the demand. 
</P>
<P>
He said the new terminal and flight schedules are designed to handle no more 
than 8.4 million passengers a year, while the demand already exists for an 
airport big enough to serve about 21 million. 
</P>
<P>
The airport expansion -- limited by the terms of a settlement of a noise damage 
lawsuit -- also doesn't provide for increased cargo capacity. "And everybody in 
business wants air cargo service," said J.J. Broadbeck, Orange County research 
director for Grubb &amp; Ellis commercial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the prospect "a long shot," he predicts "a supernova of commercial 
construction" if the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station could be opened for joint 
use by civilian cargo carriers. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, the nearly 4,000-acre Irvine Spectrum, which borders the Marine 
facility on the south and east, is likely to be the single most important 
industrial complex in the county almost until the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, smaller retail, commercial and light industrial centers will spring 
up in the hills of East Orange to serve the 13,000 homes the Irvine Co. is 
planning to build there; in Rancho Santa Margarita and the Coto de Caza areas 
to serve the homes being built in the county's backcountry, and in Santa Ana 
canyon to serve the growing residential developments in Placentia and east 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
A sizable chunk of the Irvine Coast -- 9,000 acres of rugged hills and pristine 
canyons between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach -- will be shorn, torn, graded, 
compacted and shaped into building pads that will be covered with 2,300 
million-dollar homes, several resort hotels and a small tourist-oriented retail 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The desirability of Orange County land also will continue making the area a 
prime target for overseas investors, said Ralph Sabin, head of the 
entrepreneurial business consulting division of Ernst &amp; Young in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Major investment in the '90s should come from companies in Japan, Europe, Korea 
and Singapore, Sabin said. And Orange County firms will have to seek out 
markets abroad to stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
And as traffic, air pollution and other environmental and social problems make 
downtown Los Angeles less livable, a number of large Los Angeles-based firms 
will probably move their headquarters to Orange County to be closer to the kind 
of white-collar workers they need. 
</P>
<P>
Marta Borsanyi, managing partner of the Newport Beach office of Robert Charles 
Lesser &amp; Co., a national development consulting firm that specializes in 
future planning, compares the economic changes in the '90s to those of the 
industrial revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"All in all, I'm very optimistic," she said. "The economy is changing from a 
manufacturing base to an information and technology base, and Orange County is 
in the forefront of the movement." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's economy will continue to grow in the next decade, but at a 
slower pace than in the 1980s. The county's employment base will continue to 
shift to services. 
</P>
<P>
Business Hot Spots 
</P>
<P>
The focal point of Orange County's economy should remain its central core -- 
Anaheim, Santa Ana, Orange, Costa Mesa, Newport Beach and Irvine -- but 
employment centers in South County and other scattered areas will emerge as 
development continues. 
</P>

 Up-and-Comers 
</P>
<P>
These executives -- among OC's best and brightest business minds -- could 
emerge as leaders in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ochs, pres. Fieldstone Co.: A successful homebuilder and political 
infighter, he is likely to weild his growing clout on behalf of the local real 
estate community. 
</P>
<P>
Kathyrn Braun, sr. vp. Western Digital Corp.: Rising through the ranks of the 
computer company, she is a possible successor to Chairman Roger Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Mc Craw, CEO-designee, Fluor Corp.: After making it to the top of the 
county's largest public company, he will become more involved in local civic 
business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Reed: partner, Reed &amp; Davidson: A well-connected lawyer involved in 
fund-raising for business-supported issues, he could emerge as a candidate for 
county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Lu: pres. Advanced Logic Research: From obscurity, he created a successful 
PC firm and could emerge as a force in the computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
Job Growth 
</P>
<P>
The county should add 181,280 new jobs in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
1994: 1,339,527 
</P>
<P>
Retail Sales 
</P>
<P>
Increased sales at stores, restaurants and other retail outlets should help 
keep the county's economy healthy.

1994: $25.69 billion 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
1994: 8.9% 
</P>
<P>
Personal Income 
</P>
<P>
Wages should continue to grow to keep pace with the county's high cost of 
living.

Michael Jackson says his hit songs are not his doing, that he is merely a 
conduit for tunes already written. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson made the remarks in a 1984 home video taped at his home in Encino. It 
was scheduled for broadcast tonight on "A Current Affair," said Jeff Erdel, a 
spokesman for the syndicated program. 
</P>
<P>
In the video, the reclusive star said he feels his songs existed somewhere else 
before he wrote them. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm just a tunnel, a tube through which they come," Jackson said in the 
video. "I mean, 'Billie Jean' and 'Beat It' and all those songs have been up 
there somewhere and just came through to me. So even if I did it, I just can't 
always take credit." 
</P>
<P>
The video also shows Jackson playing with his pet llamas and performing scenes 
from "Peter Pan."

BUSH TRAILING REAGAN IN FIRST-YEAR TV COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush has gotten significantly less television coverage than his 
predecessor during his first year in office and that coverage is increasingly 
negative, according to a media-monitoring group. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lichter of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan 
research group that monitors television news coverage, said an analysis of the 
Bush coverage, from his inauguration through Dec. 1, indicates that Bush has 
received about a third as much television exposure as Ronald Reagan did in the 
same period of his presidency. The amount of coverage is declining almost 
weekly and getting significantly more negative, according to Lichter. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Bush retains high public approval ratings. The latest Washington 
Post poll, taken Nov. 30-Dec. 4, found the President's job-approval rate was 
62%. While that is considered strong, it is 10 points lower than his rating a 
month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Lichter said the lack of correlation between positive media coverage and high 
poll ratings is strong evidence that the public's perception of how a President 
is doing relates only in part to his media image. "A President's image is not 
just a result of his media portrayal. It results from a general level of 
satisfaction with the public," he said. If the economy is generally strong and 
"communism is crumbling across the world," Lichter speculated, the public feels 
satisfied with presidential performance even if the news media are criticizing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lichter's assessment of about 1,800 reports on Bush and his 
Administration, the President has been the subject of 574 stories, contrasted 
to 1,782 for Reagan in the same period. Unlike Reagan's team, which consciously 
aimed at a daily television message, Bush's media aides appear to make no such 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Lichter found Bush generally had better report cards on TV for foreign policy 
and defense expertise than for domestic issues and that by far the heaviest 
coverage he has received has been in the foreign policy area, particularly 
relations with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
The study also confirmed that the Bush family dog, Millie, has been a media 
godsend. Millie, the study found, has been mentioned in more television stories 
than three Cabinet secretaries, Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos, 
Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter and Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward 
J. Derwinski.

NASH PHOTOGRAPHY SALE WILL BENEFIT MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pop musician Graham Nash has decided to auction his widely acclaimed collection 
of photography, but he won't take all the money and run. A generous portion of 
the proceeds will go to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for the 
acquisition of non-traditional photographs. 
</P>
<P>
A sale of more than 450 works from Nash's collection, scheduled for April 25 at 
Sotheby's New York, is expected to bring more than $2 million. Nash intends to 
recoup his investment -- an amount that has yet to be determined by his 
accountants. Once he has recovered his costs, he will split his profit with the 
museum. In addition, Nash will donate about 140 of the most up-to-date 
photographs to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Why is he selling? 
</P>
<P>
"I love the thrill of the chase and the energy of new fields. In the '60s, that 
energy was in rock 'n' roll. In the '70s, it was in collecting photography," 
said Nash, who rose to fame in the '60s with the rock group Crosby, Stills 
&amp; Nash. 
</P>
<P>
During the '80s, Nash said, his interests turned from photography's historical 
spectrum to contemporary works done with experimental techniques including 
computers. He has collected up-to-the-minute photographs, but now he will turn 
that job over to an institution that can handle the job professionally. 
</P>
<P>
Nash's gift of about 140 works from the '80s will give a considerable boost to 
the museum's small collection. The auction proceeds should put the County 
Museum of Art on the map as a collector of contemporary photography. While 
photography prices have risen dramatically along with the rest of the art 
market, photographs are still relatively affordable. Nash's money gift -- which 
could total several hundred thousand dollars -- will be significant. 
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted and very grateful, particularly at a time when gifts to 
museums are very hard to develop. Graham Nash's generosity will go a long, long 
way to help us build a mature department of photography," said museum director 
Earl A. Powell. 
</P>
<P>
The Nash auction will be "the most important single-owner sale of photographs 
ever to come to auction," according to Beth Gates-Warren, director of Sotheby's 
department of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive piece, expected to bring at least $60,000, is Paul 
Outerbridge's 1927 photograph depicting himself in a mask and top hat. 
</P>
<P>
A complete report on Nash's collection will be in the Tuesday Calendar section.

Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev may soon follow former President Ronald 
Reagan onto the silver screen. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Reagan, however, Gorbachev will portray himself in an Israeli-Soviet 
film based on the true story of a Soviet plane hijacked to Israel by armed 
robbers, the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported. 
</P>
<P>
The film's scriptwriter, who also serves in the Soviet Parliament, told 
Gorbachev he was looking for a double to portray him in the film. 
</P>
<P>
"Why look for a double? If I am free, I will play myself," Yedioth quoted 
Gorbachev as responding. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president will have only one line in the film titled "Direct 
Flight": 
</P>
<P>
"Do everything to protect the children." 
</P>
<P>
Last December, five Soviet robbers seized a busload of schoolchildren before 
hijacking a plane to Israel, believing it had elected an anti-communist 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Israel immediately sent the thieves back, paving the way for improved ties with 
the Soviet Union.

Stephen F. Austin Athletic Director Jim Hess was named today as New Mexico 
State's head football coach, taking over a program that has had only one 
winning season since 1967 and owns the nation's longest losing streak in 
Division I-A football. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State Athletic Director Al Gonzales announced the appointment of 
Hess, the former head football coach at Stephen F. Austin and Angelo State, to 
replace Mike Knoll, whose contract was not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Hess, 53, was the head coach at Stephen F. Austin for seven years before 
resigning after the 1988 season to devote full attention to the job of athletic 
director. He has a career collegiate coaching record of 112-53-5. 
</P>
<P>
Knoll, the fifth coach to be fired by New Mexico State since 1972, was not able 
to rebuild a sagging program that has produced only one winning record since 
1967, 6-5 in 1978. The Aggies finished 0-11 in 1989 and their 17 straight 
defeats dating back to the 1988 season is the longest losing streak in Division 
1-A. New Mexico State compiled a 4-40 record during Knoll's four-year tenure.

Italian newspapers are blaming Danny Ferry for Messaggero Rome's seventh loss 
in the Italian basketball league Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Milan's Gazzetta dello Sport and Rome's Corriere dello Sport, Italy's two 
largest sports dailies, both criticized Ferry for a streak of unforced errors 
in a 75-74 loss to Benetton Treviso at Rome's Palaeur. Massaggero led by seven 
points with two minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry elected to play in Italy after failing to come to terms with the Clippers 
of the NBA. The Clippers have since traded his rights to the Cleveland 
Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
Gazzetta wrote that Ferry could be blamed for his team's defeat. "The American 
had an inglorious day," the sports daily said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry, who made one of six 3-point goals, scored 17 points.
