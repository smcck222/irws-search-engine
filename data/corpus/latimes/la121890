"It says something about our priorities in L.A.," Dorothy Ingebretsen of Culver 
City said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
While working as a librarian at UCLA, she learned that a non-faculty employee 
who retires after 10 years is entitled to full health and medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
But . . . an employee must work 20 years to become eligible for a much bigger 
prize in this car-clogged metropolis: The right to buy a campus parking pass.

Menu Item of the Week: At Orleans restaurant in West L.A. -- "Cajun popcorn." 
It consists of chunks of meat fried in batter. Choice of crab or alligator.

<P>
Our innocent reference to "the Oingo Boingo song 'Pico and Sepulveda' " the 
other day created the biggest traffic jam of readers' calls since we blew the 
lyrics to the 1940s classic, "When Veronica Plays the Harmonica on the Pier at 
Santa Monica." (Or whatever the title was.) 
</P>
<P>
While "Pico" is included in a Boingo tape (which was all we meant to say), 
numerous people, including the distinguished radio authority, Dr. Demento, 
informed us that it was written by Eddie Maxwell and Jule Stein in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
"Pico's" definitive recording was made that year, the good doctor says, by "a 
pseudonymous contingent from the famous Freddy Martin band." The group went by 
the name "Felix Figueroa and His Orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
Don't know if you're aware, but a 2.7-magnitude earthquake struck north of 
Pomona over the weekend, causing no injuries or damage. So far no one claims to 
have predicted it. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Burton of Sunland received a dreaded "recall" letter from his auto dealer. 
It instructed him that he could remedy the problem himself or have an 
"authorized Volkswagen dealer" do it. The work amounted to replacing an 
incorrect label on the underside of his hood with the correct one. In his best 
Mr. Goodwrench manner, Burton said: "I felt I could handle it myself."

Elvis Head Update: 
</P>
<P>
L.A. radio personality Magic Matt Alan of KIIS-FM claims to have made the 
largest bid for the floral skull of the singer, last seen when it appeared in 
the 1990 Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
While two L.A. sculptors previously said they offered $75 to the owner, a 
Jackson, Miss., scrap yard, Alan is willing to part with "$500 and 100 pounds 
of extra crispy chicken straight from the Colonel." Not Col. Parker, we assume. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Martz of Hollywood shot the accompanying photo in San Clemente -- one 
that might make an unsuspecting tourist conclude that an earthquake had moved 
L.A. south of San Diego. All we know is that Pico and Sepulveda are to the 
north.

PALESTINIAN LINKAGE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Graham E. Fuller's column "Steal Iraq's Thunder on 'Linkage' " 
(Commentary, Dec. 10): 
</P>
<P>
Fuller has an excellent point. This is an opportune time to arrange a peace 
treaty in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with his general thinking with additions: Since Jordan has more than 
half of its population as Palestinians, another million or more would make 
little change there. This would give Israel more assurance of peace, if the 
West Bank and Gaza Arabs were accepted in Jordan. I'm sure Israel would help 
with the prosperity of Jordan if this could be arranged. This, too, would help 
towards a long-lasting peace in the region. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to go one step further: Include Iraq in the Arab/Israel peace 
treaty. The more Arab countries that join, the better the treaty. That is after 
Iraqis pull back from Kuwait and they are denied any gain in their aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Too, I would suggest the Arab countries that join in a peace treaty agree to 
include "democracy" as their future form of government, giving each citizen the 
right to vote and have an education. The percentage of illiteracy is too large 
in most Arab countries. 
</P>
<P>
I pray that President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker are smart enough 
to take advantage of this momentous opportunity.

<P>
We are seeing a substantial number of articles about Israel "giving up land for 
peace" in order to settle with the Arab nations on the Palestinian issue. 
</P>
<P>
It is so interesting that never do these same articles indicate that the Arab 
nations should consider "giving up land for peace." 
</P>
<P>
We see a number of articles on the anniversary of the intifada uprising, 
usually accompanied by the number of Palestinians killed by the Israelis during 
their period. Rarely do we see articles written on the number of Palestinians 
killed by fellow Palestinians because they are moderates and seek an alternate 
settlement with Israel.

A SIGN OF HOPE FOR BRAZIL'S MASSES; 
</P>
<P>
A VERDICT REFOCUSES ATTENTION ON THE 2-MILLION-SQUARE-MILE AMAZON RAIN FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The conviction of two Brazilian ranchers on charges they plotted and carried 
out the murder of environmentalist Chico Mendes is not simply a vindication of 
the late union leader's life and work. It also is a sign of hope to Brazil's 
struggling masses and a challenge to those foreigners who have embraced Mendes' 
goal of preserving the 2-million-square-mile Amazon rain forest, the world's 
largest remaining tropical woodland. 
</P>
<P>
The killers were cattle ranchers whose plans to expand their holdings by 
burning forest lands were thwarted by the activities of the rubber-tappers' 
union Mendes founded. Rubber tappers live by extracting latex and gathering 
nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, more than 1,000 members of unions and other peasant associations 
have been murdered in disputes with Brazilian landowners. Only twice before 
have the killers been convicted of their crimes. Human-rights workers hope the 
decision signals a break with Brazil's long history of judicial indifference to 
such outrages. 
</P>
<P>
The international outcry that followed Mendes' murder already has helped induce 
the Brazilian government to abolish the tax credits that made it profitable to 
convert rain forests to pastureland. It also has established a 2.4-million-acre 
"extractive" reserve in Mendes' memory, where 3,000 families earn their 
livelihood through the traditional gathering of latex and nuts. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be discovered, however, whether Chico Mendes' many vocal admirers 
in the industrialized world were attracted by his values or his brief 
celebrity. This year alone, three books have been published on his life; a film 
biography is about to go into production. But long after those books have sunk 
to the bottom of dusty remainder piles and the movie has been relegated to the 
insomniac wasteland of late-night cable, Brazil still will be struggling to 
reconcile the needs of 150 million desperately deprived people with its 
obligation to be the responsible steward of an irreplaceable natural resource. 
</P>
<P>
Successful resolution of that struggle will require not only the vigilance of 
watchful scolds, but also the constructive advice and concrete assistence of 
generous friends.

DEALING WITH WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was both annoyed and depressed by William Kahrl's article ("Can War-Ready 
Environmentalists Deal With Wilson?" Opinion, Dec. 9) regarding "war-ready" 
environmentalists' approach to Gov.-elect Pete Wilson and President Bush. 
Concern for the environment is no longer and should not be limited to a few. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has never been a trail-blazer nor a strong supporter of much of anything 
except his own career, and got on the off-shore drilling bandwagon only when it 
looked as if it was politically expedient. Why should he have to be patted and 
praised and coaxed to do what is right? The Reagan and now the Bush 
Administration have been consistently anti-environment. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidizing of wealthy agribusiness with cheap, taxpayer-supported water 
has long been a disgrace not only in terms of the deficit, but also the very 
real importance of water conservation, and Wilson should not have to be coaxed 
to help correct this problem. And to blame environmentalists for using the 
wrong tactics with these two gentlemen instead of blaming them for making poor 
decisions is ridiculous.

DRUNK-DRIVING ARRESTS INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've never been more motivated to respond to an article as I was after reading 
your front-page report on drunk driving arrests in Los Angeles over the past 
year (Dec. 3). Enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose prohibition is next, but personally, I hope I'm not around to see it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of mothers, students and everyone else against drunk driving 
self-proclaiming what progress they've made to get almost 29,000 people off the 
streets this year, why don't they put some of that energy into creating ways to 
assist people who nonmaliciously want a few drinks to get home? As a Westside 
resident for 10 years, let's face it, public transportation stinks. I do drink 
and drive because I choose not to be a prisoner in my apartment. 
</P>
<P>
To have organizations and government brag about the fact that they got that 
"alcoholic" secretary, mailman or grocery checker, who maybe had a bad day and 
just had a couple of drinks -- who might have not had a drink in months -- into 
an AA program, jail and fines far beyond their means just makes me sick. What 
rehabilitation are we talking about here? 
</P>
<P>
I, too, lost a close friend this year over a drunk-driving accident. Why not 
make part of drunk-driving punishment for first offenders 30 days of driving 
legally intoxicated people home instead of attending classes that they don't 
need, paying fines they can't afford and causing anger and hardship where it 
didn't exist? It's the season to help -- will someone?

FOWLER RIPS REPORTS ON SOCKER SALE; 
</P>
<P>
MSL:TEAM OWNER SAYS NO DECISION HAS BEEN MADE, NOR HAS ANY DEAL BEEN DISCUSSED.

<TEXT>
<P>
Socker owner Ron Fowler denied newspaper reports, which surfaced last week in 
Tacoma and Sunday in Baltimore, that said he would sell the Major Soccer League 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only have I not made a decision on this," Fowler said. "I have not even 
discussed it." 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore Sun, citing a league source, reported that Fowler would sell the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun also quoted Baltimore Blast owner Ed Hale saying, "Ron Fowler is one of 
the top owners in the league, and I will personally miss him." 
</P>
<P>
Hale went on to say that Fowler wants to sell because "his business takes him 
to Florida a lot and to Belgium often." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler says he is considering a business opportunity with the Miller Brewing 
Co. in Miami, but that he has not reached the point of making an offer. 
</P>
<P>
As for Belgium, Fowler said he has been there twice in the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted on Monday before Fowler denied the reports, Hale said he understood 
Fowler's decision to sell "is a done deal. It's kind of disappointing that an 
owner like Ron Fowler wants to get out." 
</P>
<P>
But Hale also said he thought San Diego newspapers had reported that Fowler 
will sell. No such reports have surfaced here. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said he hasn't talked to Hale for a couple months. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is something I can't explain," Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, however, did theorize that writers in Tacoma and Baltimore saw an 
article in the recent Soccer Digest that repeated a report from February that 
said Fowler would sell if a number of conditions were present. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all I can think of," Fowler said. "But most of the information in that 
article was historical. There were things in it pulled from the files 18 months 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
Another point of confusion, Fowler said, could have been a statement he made in 
July when he indicated he would sell a minority share of the club. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday he said he has not carried out that plan because some of the seven 
potential investors are friends and he does not want to let them buy into the 
club until he can "look them in the eye and tell them it would be a prudent 
investment." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman vouched for Fowler's continued interest in the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat by him on the plane coming back to San Diego (on Sunday as the team 
returned from a game in Kansas City)," Newman said. "And he was talking about 
long-term goals. Long-term league goals like whether we play too many games at 
this time of year, or whether we should move the season to the summer. He was 
talking about all different scenarios." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, however, did say he is not ruling out selling the team in the future 
and that he "fully intends to look at things after the first of the year."

MORNING BRIEFING: SMELL OF ROSES LURES DOLLARS FROM HUSKIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here come the Huskies. There goes $1,026,894. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Washington is about to become the first school to spend more 
than $1 million on its Rose Bowl excursion, a 16-day funfest that begins with 
the team's arrival in Southern California today. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items under the heading "team and staff" in the Huskies' bowl budget, 
as itemized last week by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer: 
</P>
<P>
"Awards (watches): $90,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Dry cleaning, laundry: $10,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Team Christmas party: $9,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Power-lift: $1,750." 
</P>
<P>
The power-lift is the overhead platform Coach Don James uses for viewing 
practice sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Add budget: The marching band's share of the million-plus is $181,265, with 
$1,000 going for "care of mascot." 
</P>
<P>
The president's office will spend $141,144, which includes a $20,300 
"reception-dinner" for donors and regents. 
</P>
<P>
Last add budget: Said Athletic Director Mike Lude: "It's supposed to be a 
quality experience for the people who got us where we are." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jim Muldoon, Pacific 10 assistant commissioner: "Our people have always 
had the feeling that being in the Rose Bowl is special and people should have a 
good time." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which NFL punter was the victim of the most blocked punts in his 
career? 
</P>
<P>
Cutting edge: John Eisenberg of the Baltimore Sun reported from Shreveport, 
La., on Maryland's 34-34 tie with Louisiana Tech Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
"It has long been a sporting axiom, of course, that you just never know what's 
going to happen when you tee it up in the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl. 
The only certainty is that the field will be immaculately groomed." 
</P>
<P>
Road kill: Philadelphia defensive tackle Mike Golic told Greg Logan of Newsday 
he was sidetracked more than once during the Eagles' 31-0 victory over Green 
Bay Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Said Golic: "I can't believe how (Eagle defensive end) Reggie (White) was 
throwing (Packer tackle Tony) Mandarich around. It was amazing. They're 
basically the same size, and Reggie treated him like a toy. I'd start to rush, 
and I had to watch to keep from tripping over (Mandarich). It opened up stuff 
for the rest of us, but we didn't know where to go because we didn't know where 
Reggie would throw his guy." 
</P>
<P>
Sooner, often: The Blair Rasmussen watch continues. In his team's first 22 
games, the Denver Nugget center has eight disqualifications. Barring injury, 
that pace would take him well beyond the NBA single-season record of 26, set by 
Don Meineke of the Fort Wayne Pistons in 1952-53. 
</P>
<P>
Peter May of the Boston Globe wondered: "Is Rasmussen the only Nugget who plays 
defense?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Rasmussen: "Well, being the last stand on a lot of two-on-one or 
three-on-one situations doesn't help. You try to take the charge, and sooner or 
later, you get caught." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Herman Weaver, 14 blocked punts while with the Detroit Lions 
(1970-76) and the Seattle Seahawks (1977-80). 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Rookie center Felton Spencer of the Minnesota Timberwolves, after 
Coach Bill Musselman had thrown a bar of soap at a chalkboard during halftime 
of a recent game: "It could have been worse. He could have shot somebody." TED

<P>
So the 49ers won at Anaheim Stadium and the Rams won at Candlestick Park. What 
else is new? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don't blame this one on Cleveland Gary. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire shouldn't have to apologize for trading Hubie Brooks and keeping a 
younger and better hitter, Kal Daniels. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Less than 48 hours after the Dodgers dealt Brooks to the New York Mets for Bob 
Ojeda, they sang happy birthday to Ojeda at a Stadium Club news conference and 
wheeled out a cake big enough for 33 candles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Gary Carter would be a good pickup for a team whose candidates to back up 
catcher Mike Scioscia are Carlos Hernandez and Barry Lyons. . . . 
</P>
<P>

PHILLIPS TO DISCUSS FUTURE

<P>
Nose tackle Joe Phillips will hold a news conference today at his agent's 
office in La Jolla to discuss his future with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, on injured reserve since late September after he was assaulted in 
Mission Beach, has been medically cleared to return to practice but hasn't 
because of a salary dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard said Monday the Chargers intend to pay 
Phillips 50% of this year's salary. Beathard said the Chargers wanted Phillips 
to practice during the bye week to determine if he could handle normal contact. 
According to Beathard, Phillips said he wouldn't return to practice unless he 
was granted full payment on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
The salary dispute is apparently only part of the holdup. Beathard said the 
Chargers asked Phillips to sign a waver relieving the team of responsibility in 
the event Phillips was re-injured on the football field. Beathard also said the 
Chargers wanted Phillips to sign a new contract before his current one expires 
Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Billy Ray Smith reinjured his elbow in Sunday's loss to the Broncos 
but said he expects to be ready for this week's game against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Richard Brown (hamstring) is eligible to come off injured reserve 
this week and Coach Dan Henning said he may be activated. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Chargers would consider activating rookie quarterback John Friesz, 
Henning said: "The only reason that we would consider that is if we we were 
going to start him and we're not going to do that right now." 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean Friesz won't give Billy Joe Tolliver a run for the starting 
job in the future. Henning said the quarterback situation would be evaluated 
during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said it would be nice to see what Friesz could do but that activating 
him for the remainder of this season might do him and the team more harm than 
good because of his limited experience. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing game films, Henning didn't agree with the call that ruled tight 
end Derrick Walker had fumbled on the Broncos' one-yard line in the first 
quarter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"My impression is that he was down," Henning said. "The ball should have been 
blown dead on the one-yard line." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have distributed about 43,000 tickets for the last home game 
Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs, said Jack Teele, assistant to the 
president. Teele expects a crowd of about 47,000 by kickoff. DON PATTERSON

SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES: PS GROUP REMOVES HURDLE FOR BERKSHIRE STOCK PURCHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PS Group has modified its anti-takeover defense to clear the way for Berkshire 
Hathaway Inc. to acquire up to 45% of the San Diego-based company. 
</P>
<P>
Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
-based Berkshire Hathaway, which serves in part as an investment vehicle for 
investor Warren E. Buffet, now owns 22.1% of PS Group's shares. 
</P>
<P>
PS Group's board of directors on Friday modified corporate bylaws that 
prohibited Buffet from acquiring more than 22.5% of PS Group's shares. 
</P>
<P>
However, Berkshire Hathaway, which has indicated that it will seek additional 
PS Group shares, won't be able to acquire more than 25% of PS Group's common 
shares until after the Federal Trade Commission reviews possible antitrust 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
According to a prepared statement released by PS Group, Berkshire Hathaway's 
future acquisitions of the company's shares "will depend on price, market 
conditions, availability of funds and Berkshire's evaluation of other 
investment opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Berkshire, which holds large shares in Capital Cities/ABC Inc., Washington Post 
Co., GEICO Corp. and other companies, is known to be a largely passive 
investor. Buffet has agreed not to sell his PS Group shares to a hostile 
bidder, not to wage a proxy contest to oust PS Group's board and not to oppose 
the company's board, according to PS Group Vice President Larry Guske. 
</P>
<P>
PS Group is an aircraft leasing and holding company that owns controlling 
interests in USTravel Systems Inc., a travel management company, and Recontek 
Inc., which recycles metallic hazardous wastes.

SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cubic Corp. on Monday settled a shareholder lawsuit that alleged that 
executives at the San Diego-based defense contractor used defense-industry 
consultants to bribe federal officials in order to win lucrative contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, in which Cubic acknowledged no wrongdoing, was approved during 
a brief hearing before U.S. District Court Magistrate Harry R. McCue. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement approved on Monday included $1.2 million for plaintiffs' 
attorney fees but no monetary award for Cubic shareholders who had sought 
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement was driven in part by the "unavailability of insurance coverage 
to satisfy a judgment" against the company, according to terms of the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement approved on Monday, Cubic agreed to have a 
"distinguished professor of corporate law" lecture its executives on "a 
director's obligation to shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Cubic also agreed to stage "regular presentations" to its employees about 
"ethical considerations in government contracting." 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed in 1988, shortly after federal agents searched Cubic's San 
Diego-based Defense Systems division during the ongoing "Ill Wind" 
investigation into procurement fraud in the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been brought against Cubic or its executives in connection with 
that investigation. However, the settlement reached on Monday acknowledged the 
possibility that Cubic might seek a "compromise disposition" of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
No shareholders appeared at Monday morning's hearing. GREG JOHNSON

PEOPLE: LYNN NAMED PRESIDENT OF PRICE CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mitchell G. Lynn, 42, has been named president of Price Co., the San 
Diego-based chain of membership discount warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
Price Co. stock closed down $1.375 to $36.875 in over the counter trading 
Monday but retail analyst Sarah Stack of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los 
Angeles discounted a "link between the news announcement and the stock price 
decline." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Costco fell by $.75 and that May Co. was down $1 in Monday trading, 
Stack said other retail stocks declined on Monday, possibly a result of the 
segment being "overvalued" on the whole. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn has held a variety of posts within Price Co. since joining the company as 
controller in 1979. Most recently, he was president of Price Club Industries, 
which includes the chain's photo processing, optical services, food packaging 
and other warehouse operations. 
</P>
<P>
A certified public accountant, Lynn is a graduate of UCLA. He replaces Robert 
Price, who will continue to be Price Co. chief executive and board chairman. 
Lynn will be given a seat on Price's board of directors after the annual 
shareholders meeting next month, the company said.

QUANTUM FUND INVESTS IN AUTOFINANCE'S BAD CREDIT RISKS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: THE BURBANK CAR LOAN COMPANY SOLD THE INTERNATIONAL MONEY FUND ON ITS 
20% INTEREST RATES AND BELIEF IN BORROWERS WITH POOR FINANCIAL HISTORIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is how Quantum Fund, N.V., the legendary international investment fund run 
by renowned money-manager George Soros, made some of its money this year. It 
reportedly laid down about $900 million on the risky bet that Japanese stocks 
would take a dive, and staked about $2 billion on the gamble that the fall of 
the Berlin Wall would cause the German mark to soar. Both bets paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Then Quantum took some of its smart money to Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
In late November, Quantum acquired a 25% stake in AutoFinance Group Inc., an 
obscure 17-month-old Burbank auto lending company, for about $5 million. On the 
surface, the investment looks strange. AutoFinance lost nearly $700,000 in the 
three months ended Sept. 30, and its business is making car loans to people 
whom other lenders consider bad credit risks. So why did Soros, one of the 400 
richest people in the United States, according to Forbes magazine, consider 
Quantum a good investment? 
</P>
<P>
Quantum doesn't comment on its investment decisions. But AutoFinance 
executives, who effectively went to Quantum to sell it on investing in their 
company, argued that AutoFinance has a chance to grow fast because borrowers 
with bad credit histories represent a large but neglected market and a risk 
worth taking. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tremendous growth opportunity there," said AutoFinance Chief 
Executive A.E. Steinhaus, former chief operating officer of Nissan Motor 
Acceptance Corp., a Torrance-based financing arm of the big Japanese car maker. 
</P>
<P>
Another attraction is that AutoFinance's loans carry interest rates of 20%, 
compared to the more typical 12% to 16% charged to more credit-worthy auto loan 
borrowers. AutoFinance figures the high rate more than makes up for the risk of 
lending to people whom other institutions turn down. 
</P>
<P>
AutoFinance makes loans through car dealers in California and New Mexico. Its 
$16.87-million auto loan portfolio mainly consist of loans to "non-prime 
credits," lending lingo for people with scanty credit records or who have been 
through bankruptcy or have had late-payment problems in the past, but are 
looking to mend their records. 
</P>
<P>
AutoFinance is dwarfed by lenders such as General Motors Acceptance Corp. 
(GMAC), which has about $90.5 billion in outstanding auto loans. But Steinhaus 
says the biggest auto lenders -- such as GMAC, the finance arm of General 
Motors -- don't consistently lend to "non-prime" borrowers, leaving an opening 
for others. "They come out with a first-time buyers program when they need to 
sell cars," Steinhaus said of the big auto makers, but they don't offer car 
dealers a consistent source of loans for marginal borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime auto industry analyst Arvid Jouppi, with Keane Securities in Detroit, 
agreed. "The Big Three go in and out of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
AutoFinance's strategy for making loans is to stay in much closer touch with 
the borrowers than do most auto finance companies. The company reminds 
borrowers that their payments are due 10 days ahead of time, then calls if 
payments are as little as two days late. Steinhaus said most car loan customers 
are used to making bill payments 20 to 60 days late. "We are basically trying 
to educate them," said Steinhaus. As of Sept. 30, less than 1% of the company's 
loans had payments more than 30 days overdue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of close attention to borrowers requires a big staff. And AutoFinance 
figured that "in this business the worst thing you can do is hire people after 
they're already needed," said Chief Financial Officer Blair T. Nance. 
</P>
<P>
So in June, 1989, the company hired 34 people before it actually started 
lending. Today, the same size staff monitors nearly 2,000 loans, and the 
company only expects to hire a few more people as it grows during the next six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Steinhaus said such hiring ahead of time accounts for AutoFinance's current 
losses, which he expects to last through much of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Steinhaus and Nance helped start AutoFinance after both quit top positions at 
Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp. -- Nance was treasurer and controller. They got 
the money for their company through private placements and bank loans secured 
by stockholders.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Woodland Hills real estate agent was sentenced Monday to five years probation 
and 300 hours of community service for understating his 1984 and 1985 real 
estate commissions by more than $84,000, the Internal Revenue Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp also ordered Martin Parker Williams II to 
pay all back taxes, including penalties, interest and the costs of prosecution. 
A jury convicted Williams in October of signing false federal income tax 
returns for 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is the owner and president of White House Properties in Woodland 
Hills. The case grew out of an investigation by the IRS and the U. S. 
Attorney's office, IRS spokeswoman Jan Gribbon said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: JUDGE LIFTS BAN ON SALE OF ART WITH CAFE'S LOGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal district judge in Los Angeles has lifted a temporary restraining 
order barring Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc., an art retailer and 
distributor based in Van Nuys, from delivering silk screen prints bearing the 
Hard Rock Cafe logo. 
</P>
<P>
Judge J. Spencer Letts said Hard Rock Cafe America, which sought an extension 
of the order, failed to prove that buyers would think that the Hard Rock Cafe 
issued the print or authorized Martin Lawrence to use its logo. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary order was lifted Friday, a week after it was issued. 
</P>
<P>
Hard Rock Cafe will appeal the ruling, said the company's attorney, Harry B. 
Swerdlow. The company also will pursue its lawsuit against Martin Lawrence, 
claiming that the serigraph print by Hiromichi Yamagata violates its trademark 
rights, Swerdlow said. The suit also seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
The print shows a hot-air balloon in the shape of an upside-down teapot bearing 
the Hard Rock Cafe logo. Martin Lawrence Chairman Martin S. Blinder said each 
print in the 555-piece edition has a retail value of about $3,800. The company 
began selling the prints earlier this month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Blinder said the company has not determined what effect, if any, the 
restraining order had on fourth-quarter earnings.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nu-Med Inc., an Encino operator of hospitals and other health care facilities, 
reported a $3.32-million loss for its fiscal second quarter, compared with a 
$2.89-million loss a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The latest loss, which Nu-Med attributed in part to lower occupancy rates at 
its hospitals, came on a 7% decline in its revenue, to $60.8 million in the 
quarter that ended Oct. 31 from $65.5 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of its fiscal year, Nu-Med had a loss of $2.36 million, 
compared with a $1.85-million loss a year earlier. Nu-Med's six-month revenue 
fell 9%.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: SEMTECH REPORTS LOSS OF $152,000 IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Semtech Corp., a Newbury Park maker of rectifiers and other electronic 
components, reported a $152,000 loss for its fiscal third quarter, contrasted 
with a $251,000 profit a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The loss in the quarter that ended Oct. 28 came despite a 12% increase in 
revenue, to $5.47 million from $4.90 million. The loss partly reflected a 
$300,000 charge that Semtech incurred during the quarter in connection with 
closure of a subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Semtech's net income fell to 
$40,000 from $830,000 a year earlier, and its nine-month revenue edged up to 
$14.8 million from $14.6 million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: ATI MEDICAL POSTS $290,800 QUARTERLY LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATI Medical Inc., a Glendale company that rents medical equipment to hospitals, 
reported a $290,800 loss for its fiscal first quarter, compared with a $792,364 
profit a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The loss in the quarter ended Oct. 31 came despite a 13% increase in ATI's 
revenue, to $13 million from $11.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
ATI blamed the loss on rivals' price cutting in certain markets, and reduced 
orders during September in response to threatened health care cutbacks in the 
federal budget. "Volume improved dramatically in October following a 
congressional decision to keep that funding intact," ATI said.

Dressing Down: For the second year in a row, the International Assn. of Custom 
Tailors &amp; Designers has omitted Donald Trump from its "best-dressed" list, 
although apparently the slight has nothing to do with wardrobe. Don Case, a 
spokesman for the tailors' group, said Trump's own tailor has pointedly told 
the besieged tycoon that he needs a haircut. 
</P>
<P>
"A pile of hair in back of his neck is not conducive to a gentlemanly 
appearance," Case said. 
</P>
<P>
* Dressing Up: Those who did make the list include Britain's Prince Charles, 
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 
former President Ronald Reagan. Among the rest: Vito Pascucci, president of the 
Leblanc musical instrument company, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. 
</P>
<P>
* A Princely Sum: U.S. District Judge Hugh Robinson has ordered the auctioning 
of the Atlanta mansion owned by Saudi Prince Faisal Mohamed Al-Saud Al Kabir. 
The judge ruled Friday that Faisal had abused the judicial process by 
transferring the mansion, its furnishings and a gun collection to a holding 
corporation to protect it from bankruptcy. One of the prince's chief creditors 
is the CJS Corp., which is headed by former Georgia Gov. Carl Sanders, who says 
the prince owes CJS $11 million. The prince reportedly is in Saudi Arabia 
seeking financing. 
</P>
<P>
* Street Talkers: Neighborhood volunteers trying to discourage prostitution are 
posing as hookers and handing "johns" literature about AIDS in the Uptown area 
of Chicago. Wearing heavy makeup, furs and other streetwalker garb, residents 
have been flagging down men in the middle of the night to spread the word about 
the risk of disease. Police Sgt. Robert Sarnowski says the program could be 
dangerous for the activists. "Once a john is in a car with a girl, I don't 
think he's going to be inclined to read any literature," he said.

DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS BEING EYED AS ARENA BY OWNER OF L.A. LAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Buss, sports entrepreneur and owner of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball 
team, has expressed interest in building a "world-class" sports arena at the 
Del Mar Fairgrounds, operators of the facility said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Buss met last month in Encinitas with three members of the 22nd District 
Agricultural Assn. board, which operates the fairgrounds, to discuss "the 
construction and placement of a world-class facility," said Allan Royster, a 
member of the board. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an exploratory conversation at best," Royster said. "He was putting out 
his feelers. He outlined his feelings for the San Diego area, which were very 
positive. And he wanted to get a handle on our feelings about such a venture, 
what the community reaction might be. 
</P>
<P>
"But I get the feeling that he is looking at several other areas of the county 
as well. It wasn't a conversation that went, 'You're my choice. This is what I 
want to build and this is where I want to build it.' He was very casual." 
</P>
<P>
Buss, 57, could not be reached for comment Monday. But Bob Steiner, public 
relations director for California Sports Inc., the parent company for several 
of Buss' sports ventures, said Del Mar is among several sites the owner has in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mr. Buss has decided on a spot, he hasn't told me," he said. "As far as I 
know, he hasn't narrowed down just where he'll put in his bid for a new 
expansion team -- in Anaheim (in Orange County) or San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"He just hasn't ruled anything out at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Royster said that by the term world-class facility, he assumes that Buss' plans 
call for building a multiuse arena such as the Forum, the facility Buss owns in 
Inglewood that is home to two professional sports teams -- the Los Angeles 
Lakers of basketball and the Los Angeles Kings of hockey -- as well as the site 
of rock concerts and other special events. 
</P>
<P>
"I assume he's got several uses in mind or he wouldn't be spending the kind of 
money it takes to build such an arena," Royster said. 
</P>
<P>
The Del Mar Fairgrounds has two construction projects under way and a third 
scheduled to begin next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A $5-million horse arena and a $13-million satellite wagering facility are both 
due to be completed in 1991. Also next year, officials will begin building a 
$107-million public grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there's always room for another project, Royster said. "There are places 
to build" a new arena, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While the full board has yet to consider the issue, Royster said a new sports 
arena would get his vote of approval. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar Mayor Jan McMillan said she has not received any word on the potential 
project. "But if traffic problems increase," she said, "then it would be a big 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Royster said, officials are content to sit and wait for a decision.

GROUP ASKS FCC NOT TO RENEW KCET'S LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON BERNSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A conservative media watchdog organization that criticized Los Angeles public 
television station KCET for airing the newsmagazine "South Africa Now" has 
asked the Federal Communications Commission not to renew the station's license. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-member Committee on Media Integrity filed a petition against license 
renewal with the FCC on Monday, according to its chairman, David Horowitz, a 
former '60s radical who rejected the left and co-wrote "Destructive Generation: 
Second Thoughts About the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
The petition also asks the FCC to turn down KCET's request for a new 
transmitter in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Goen, spokeswoman for KCET, said the station could not comment about 
the petition because executives there had not yet seen it. 
</P>
<P>
Under FCC rules, anyone may file a petition to deny a station its license, but 
such petitions are rarely successful. They are most often used as a tactic to 
compel a station to respond to the petitioner's complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz said his organization will withdraw the challenge if certain demands 
are met, including the creation of an elected board of directors for the 
station. The group also wants the station to set up a paid position for an 
ombudsman. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz became the focus of national media attention in October, when KCET 
decided to pull "South Africa Now" for alleged bias -- a decision the station 
later rescinded -- and he claimed credit for raising the issue of the program's 
balance with station executives. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz said his organization decided to challenge KCET's license because ever 
since the "South Africa Now" controversy, members have been unable to get a 
fair hearing for their views. 
</P>
<P>
KCET's Goen disagreed with that contention, saying, "Mr. Horowitz has had an 
unprecedented amount of communication and access to KCET. He has had meetings 
with the chairman, the president, the executive vice president, the general 
counsel, the head of programming and several other board members over a 
two-year period. . . . There comes a point where certainly we think we have 
heard what he has to say."

PANEL SEES THREAT TO 30,000 JOBS HERE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT WOULD LEAVE 
RATHER THAN IMPLEMENT COSTLY NEW CLEAR AIR RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tough clean air rules could cost 30,000 jobs if Southern California companies 
leave the region rather than implement costly anti-smog regulations, a 
coalition of business and labor leaders said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Coalition for Jobs and a Clean Environment delivered a 
simple message to the South Coast Air Quality Management District: Let's talk. 
</P>
<P>
"We want clean air. We want clean water. But at the same time, the quality of 
life is dependent on having a job," said William Campbell, president of the 
California Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition said 106 companies in the region estimated they would lose 
between 24,000 and 30,000 jobs during the next decade because of the new clean 
air rules. 
</P>
<P>
With an existing 6.7% unemployment rate in California, the area can ill afford 
to lose the jobs, industry leaders told reporters at a Greater Los Angeles 
Press Club news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The survey was taken in reaction to rules imposed by the AQMD, the regional 
agency assigned to battle the country's worst smog. Its regulations are so 
far-reaching that critics say they will stifle the regional economy. 
</P>
<P>
District spokesman Bill Kelly estimated costs for complying with the rules 
adopted in March, 1989, would vary widely. A large power plant might pay 
roughly $8 million per smokestack, while a dry cleaning operation might pay 
several thousand dollars for new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said business leaders are concerned about environmental issues, and 
that fewer jobs would be lost if they could sit down and discuss "creative" 
ideas with district officials. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell cited Unocal's recent program under which gas-guzzling older model 
cars were purchased and snatched from roadways as being better than sweeping 
directives which simply indicate what a business cannot do. 
</P>
<P>
The year-old coalition includes the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, the 
Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, the California Manufacturers Assn. and 
the Ethnic Coalition of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition members asked to meet with district Chairman Norton Younglove to 
discuss its recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Those include providing job retraining and turning the AQMD's public advisory 
office into an ombudsman to help small businesses deal with the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
District spokesman Tom Eichhorn said he was surprised by the appeal for 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had been talking," he said. "We're willing to meet with them any 
time they want. We want dialogue. However, we still have a bottom line of 
emissions reduction we have to meet."

PROBE TARGETS 2 EX-OFFICERS ON CHARGERS' PAYROLL; 
</P>
<P>
TASK FORCE: RECORDS ARE SEIZED IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE IF THE FORMER 
POLICEMEN 'DOUBLE-DIPPED' BY COLLECTING TWO SALARIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A law enforcement task force investigating police corruption has seized 
financial records from the San Diego Chargers to determine whether two former 
San Diego police officers "double-dipped" by simultaneously collecting salaries 
from the football team and the Police Department, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks ago today, members of the Metropolitan Homicide Task Force served a 
search warrant at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium for the payroll and employee 
records of Dick Lewis and George Varela, longtime liaisons between the police 
chief's office and the Chargers football team. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Lewis nor Varela could be reached for comment during repeated attempts 
during the past week. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 52, and Varela, 53, both worked for the Police Department for 20 years. 
From 1981 until last year, they worked as "community relations assistants" to 
the Chargers and reported directly to the police chief. 
</P>
<P>
Their primary job was to work with Charger players in promoting drug education 
and crime prevention efforts in underprivileged communities. They also were 
employed by the Chargers to provide security on the sidelines during games and 
had approval to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Both Lewis and Varela were mentioned in a 1986 Times series on ticket-fixing 
that found that a number of tickets, some to Charger players, were dismissed at 
their request. The scandal led to written reprimands for then-Police Chief Bill 
Kolender and then-Assistant Chief Bob Burgreen. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 1989-90 San Diego County Grand Jury reportedly heard testimony 
suggesting that team members received preferential treatment from police 
because of Lewis and Varela. 
</P>
<P>
The pair retired from the Police Department last year after Burgreen, who was 
appointed chief after Kolender retired, became concerned with the perception 
that the Chargers were getting preferential police protection. He asked Varela 
and Lewis to decide whether to stay with the department or join the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1989, the Chargers hired both men full time to provide security. 
Team spokesman Bill Johnston said they provide player security during road 
games. Marketing director Rich Israel said they make sure players are in bed at 
the proper times and guard the team's hotel floor to make certain they are not 
disturbed. Both men can be seen on the team's sideline during games, where they 
provide protection for Head Coach Dan Henning. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston and Chargers business manager Pat Curran said they had no comment 
about the investigation. Jack Teele, assistant to the president, said he had 
not heard anything about it. General Manager Bobby Beathard did not return 
several telephone calls to his office. 
</P>
<P>
The task force seized the team's financial and business records that related to 
Varela and Lewis on Nov. 6, looking primarily to compare the hours that the 
pair worked for the Chargers and for the department, according to a source 
close to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The focus of the records is (to investigate) the income they received," the 
source said. "That's one of the issues -- whether they were paid by both" the 
department and team at the same time. "If they were working for the Chargers on 
city time, that's taking city money." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Police Chief Norm Stamper said he would not comment on the 
investigation, but said the department has a "very strict policy on what's 
commonly referred to as double-dipping. You get paid by one (organization) or 
the other but not both." 
</P>
<P>
If police officers get paid for outside jobs, that work must take place during 
off-duty hours, Stamper said. All officers must submit requests for outside 
employment, and department administrators determine whether "there's any chance 
that outside employment would reflect poorly on the department or compromise 
the integrity of the department in any way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stamper said the department, for example, has denied some requests for police 
officers to work as private security guards when it might be perceived that a 
business is getting preferential police protection under such circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Varela and Lewis held "unique positions," Stamper said, in that they reported 
directly to Kolender and were the first full-time employees devoted to 
developing better community relations between the chief and various ethnic 
communities in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Stamper said the department believed it was a good idea for Varela and Lewis to 
work with the Chargers because drug abuse and crime prevention programs worked 
best with professional football players as role models for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Both men did such a good job promoting the department's programs, Stamper said, 
that Burgreen now has four community relations assistants: one for the black 
community, one for the Latino community, one for the Asian community and one 
for the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Burgreen determined that having Varela and Lewis work for the 
Chargers "was a relationship that constituted a violation of our policy," and 
both were given a choice of staying or leaving, Stamper said. They retired 
within two weeks of each other. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers and their superiors are responsible for accurately accounting 
for their hours on time cards and overtime slips, Stamper said, adding that 
Varela and Lewis could be prosecuted if the investigation concludes that the 
pair collected money from both sources for working the same hours. 
</P>
<P>
Besides investigating police corruption, the 2-year-old Metropolitan Homicide 
Task Force is probing the murders of 44 prostitutes and transients since 1985. 
The task force is a collection of detectives and prosecutors from the district 
attorney's office, the state attorney general's office, the Police Department 
and the county Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The branch of the task force probing police corruption is also seeking to 
determine whether police had anything to do with the disappearance or murders 
of any prostitutes.

JUDGE DENIES RETRIAL OVER LAND SEIZED FOR JAIL; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: DECISION LEAVES THE COUNTY TO DEAL WITH THE $55.6-MILLION VERDICT 
AWARDED BY A JURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Creating the time and the incentive for settlement talks, a Superior Court 
judge refused Monday to order a new trial in a case in which San Diego County 
was hit with a $55.6-million verdict for land it seized from developer Roque de 
la Fuente II to build the East Mesa jail. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Jeffrey T. Miller sharply rejected a series of claims by the county 
urging a new trial, including contentions that the verdict is excessive and 
that jurors sought to punish the county with the whopping sum. He said there 
was no merit to those -- and several other -- claims. 
</P>
<P>
Miller held off, however, from concluding formally at a lengthy hearing Monday 
that the jury clearly could not have come to any other verdict, the legal test 
for a new trial. He said he simply wanted time to think about it. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for De la Fuente said the judge had until Jan. 7 to make up his mind. 
De la Fuente said that Miller created not only a ready-made time frame for 
settlement talks but -- having essentially shot down the request for a new 
trial -- the incentive for the county to come to terms. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, basically, he's giving the county one more opportunity to sit down 
and negotiate," De la Fuente said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was amenable to a deal. "I've been willing to negotiate since 1985," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Thorsnes, one of De la Fuente's attorneys, said there have been only 
preliminary talks with county officials since the Sept. 28 jury verdict. 
Thorsnes declined, however, to say what settlement sum would be acceptable to 
De la Fuente. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't try this case in the papers and we're not going to settle it in the 
papers," Thorsnes said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller also was due Monday to take up a request from De la Fuente's attorneys 
for $15.4 million in fees, which -- as the winning side -- the lawyers are 
seeking from the county on top of the $55.6 million. That request was put off, 
at the county's request, until Jan. 14, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
With interest on the $55.6 million accumulating daily, as it has been since the 
county seized the 525 acres from De la Fuente in 1987, and adding in the 
lawyers' fees, De la Fuente and his attorneys are believed to be asking for a 
total of $80 million from the financially strapped county. Supervisors have 
said the county does not have that kind of cash. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have envisioned the East Mesa facility -- near the U.S.-Mexico 
border, about seven miles east of Interstate 805 -- as the central ingredient 
in solving a longstanding jail crowding problem. The county's six jails hold 
hundreds more inmates than the state recommends. 
</P>
<P>
The East Mesa site is immediately east of a state prison -- built on land that 
also had been owned by the De la Fuente family. The family owns real estate, 
car dealerships and a bank. 
</P>
<P>
De la Fuente wanted $10.24 million to settle the case before trial. The 
county's final pretrial offer was $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the county claimed that the East Mesa site would be best used 
for residential housing. The jury, however, bought De la Fuente's contention 
that it was a remarkable plot ideally suited for a jail, returning the $55.6 
million verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1985, the county and De la Fuente began negotiations for the 
family to sell the site. Unable to reach agreement, the county condemned the 
parcel on Sept. 16, 1987, through its eminent domain powers. 
</P>
<P>
The jury had to decide the "highest and best" use of the land -- defined as one 
that produces the most economic benefit -- and, then, the value of that land 
for that use. It decided the site was best suited for a jail and put the fair 
market value at $55.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident the jury completely rejected the county's position with regard 
to the 'highest and best' use (of the land), and rightly so," Miller said 
Monday. He said the county's notion -- that prospective home buyers would buy 
two-acre estates overlooking the state prison -- was unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
He also said there was no reason to believe the jury made its award out of 
sympathy, passion or prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
The county made several other claims in arguing that the $55.6-million verdict 
was improper, suggesting that the jury was biased, that De la Fuente's 
attorneys had access to a secret county juror computer and that Miller allowed 
the developer's lawyers to discuss irrelevant issues. 
</P>
<P>
Rejecting all those claims, Miller said the county provided no evidence to back 
up any of them.

HOLIDAY SHELTER NEEDS VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1,000 homeless men and women are expected at the fifth annual Mayor's 
Holiday Shelter next week, a mayor's spokeswoman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Medical attention, showers, haircuts, clothing, dinner and lodging will be 
available to the homeless in Plaza Hall at the Community Concourse for three 
nights, beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Organized activities and entertainment featuring singers, an African 
storyteller, the Curbside Players (a group of homeless musicians) and others 
are planned. 
</P>
<P>
"What has made this shelter so successful year after year has been the 
tremendous effort of volunteers," Mayor Maureen O'Connor said. "They treat each 
person coming into the shelter as if he or she were a guest in their own home." 
</P>
<P>
With less than a week to go, however, the shelter is about 400 volunteers short 
of the 1,000 needed to work the shelter's various 4-hour shifts. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers should call United Way Volunteer Center at 492-2121. Barbers and 
beauticians can volunteer to give haircuts by calling Chris Urquhart at 
Episcopal Community Services, 260-8128. 
</P>
<P>
Blankets, ribbons or bows for tree trimming, used books, letter writing 
materials, men's clothing, trial-size hygiene items and board games are among 
needed items. 
</P>
<P>
Blankets can be brought to branch libraries and local fire stations until 
Friday. All items can be dropped off at the city operations building parking 
lot, on A Street between 1st Avenue and Front Street, from 10 a.m.-4 p.m. 
Saturday and 10 a.m.-8:30 p.m. Sunday and Monday.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A masked gunman robbed a San Diego bank Monday morning in what appears to be 
the sixth of a series of related bank robberies across the county in the past 
two months, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A man wearing a gray ski mask entered the Jackson-Hyde Park branch of Bank of 
America shortly after it opened at 9 a.m., leaped over the teller's counter and 
demanded money from two tellers, touching them with his revolver for emphasis, 
San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber stuffed an undisclosed amount of money into a canvas bag before 
escaping on foot, Robinson said. The tellers and eight customers inside the 
bank, at 7404 Jackson Drive, were unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
The robber's methods were similar to those used in a series of bank robberies 
that began Nov. 2, leading police to believe they may have been committed by 
the same man, Robinson said. One difference, however, was the color of the 
man's ski mask, which was described as flesh-colored in a previous robbery.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN MARCOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Marcos firm that provides health care services for migrants and the poor 
in several North County cities will receive a federal grant of $1.5 million 
next month, an official in the agency said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has agreed to provide the 
money to North County Health Services, a private nonprofit corporation with 
clinics in Ramona, San Marcos, Oceanside and Encinitas, said Susan Westlund, an 
NCHS director. 
</P>
<P>
The firm is funded largely by federal and state grants. 
</P>
<P>
"The money allows us to give our clients a sliding-scale discount off the cost 
of health care," Westlund said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of a three-year commitment by the federal agency, the grant is to be used 
by NCHS during 1991, she said. Much of the money is used to offer health care 
to migrant workers and others who could not otherwise afford medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
NCHS sees an average of 4,000 to 5,000 patients per month, Westlund said.

NEED FOR VIGILANCE SEEN TO ENFORCE ETHICS LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scandals have swirled around Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and City Hall for 
nearly two years, prompting investigations, voter-approved reforms and creation 
of a new government watchdog agency. 
</P>
<P>
From a small, nonprofit research office in West Los Angeles, lawyer and 
government ethics expert Robert M. Stern has been a key figure in the 
continuing drama and debate. He helped reporters covering City Hall work 
through a thicket of state and local campaign and conflict-of-interest laws. He 
helped a citizens panel, headed by former California Common Cause Chairman 
Geoffrey Cowan, craft a new Code of Ethics for the city. And he helped shepherd 
the landmark package of reforms through the City Council and onto the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Slim, slightly rumpled and soft-spoken, the bespectacled 46-year-old looks more 
symphony musician -- he plays French horn in a Westside orchestra -- than 
political guru. But said Cowan: "He's an intellectual force and one of the 
leading and most knowledgeable people on law and political tactics in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
As general counsel of the California Commission on Campaign Financing, Stern 
has co-written major studies of politics that have shaped several recent state 
and local reform measures. The views in this interview are his, not necessarily 
the commission's. He also drafted much of the state's current 
conflict-of-interest and campaign law while serving eight years as general 
counsel for the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Under Los Angeles' new ethics law, which will be phased in beginning in 
January, Stern sees a chance to begin rebuilding public confidence in local 
government. But ensuring that the spirit of the law is aggressively enforced 
requires vigilance, he warns. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When you look at the ethics controversy over the last couple of years in Los 
Angeles, what do you see as the crux of the problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: People coming in, wanting government to make decisions which involve 
millions and in some cases billions of dollars. And the question of how do they 
influence the government to make those decisions. In court what we do is make 
the best case you can. . . . You don't give campaign contributions to the 
judges. . . . You don't wine and dine the judge. . . . When it comes to 
legislative bodies, campaign money and honoraria and gifts are given to 
decision makers at the same time decisions are being made. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How is that different than what has historically happened? 
</P>
<P>
A: Historically, it was worse. I think it's getting better. We have much more 
honest and honorable decision makers today than we had 20 or 30 years ago. . . 
. One of the reasons, I think, are the (campaign and personal finance) 
disclosure laws. Another reason is a very aggressive press. And a third reason 
is, I just think we have better people. 
</P>
<P>
When I was in Sacramento in the early '70s the word was that several people 
were taking money from lobbyists and just pocketing the money. . . . I think 
legislators now are raising money to ensure they stay in power, as opposed to 
getting rich. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Polling shows voters think that elected officials sell votes for campaign 
contributions. Do we have "legalized bribery," as some say? Is the public 
perception that the system is corrupt accurate? 
</P>
<P>
A: I wouldn't go so far as to say it's legalized bribery. But I would say that 
the public is ahead of the politicians. The public knows something is wrong, 
(but) probably exaggerates it. 
</P>
<P>
I think (elected officials) are much more honest than the public gives them 
credit for, given the pressures they are under, given the amount of money 
that's involved. It must be very tempting to want a piece of the action, if you 
are a city councilman, having people that are making five times your salary 
coming in and begging you for a decision . . . that means millions. Yet, we see 
very few examples where the City Council person or the staff or the city 
administrators have benefited financially. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time I think the City Council members underestimate the perception 
of receiving all this campaign money (from) the developer or the person who is 
coming before them. Their vote on it tells the public, well, there's 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
You don't see developers making very many contributions at times when their 
developments aren't before the City Council or the supervisors. You don't see 
cable companies making great contributions now that the cable contracts have 
been awarded. 
</P>
<P>
You have to pay to play. And there's this feeling by many people that there is 
nothing wrong with that. The givers . . . feel it's sort of a cost of doing 
business. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, the campaign money is the way a politician says: I'll be making the 
decision but there's something in return that everybody has to give in order to 
be involved. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who are the culprits in the system? Is it the politicians, is it business, 
is it apathetic voters, is it the news media? 
</P>
<P>
A: Probably the apathetic voter is No. 1. You have a turnout in the city of Los 
Angeles that is 23% in this last mayoral election. In the City Council election 
before that it was 13%. Part of the reason for that is . . . the election is 
held all by itself (in April). If the election was held in November, you'd have 
a turnout of 60%. 
</P>
<P>
The politicians are to blame in the sense that they are very reluctant to 
change the system. The press is less to blame. I'm just not sure enough people 
are reading the newspapers. People are getting their news now from TV and I 
think TV news certainly isn't as aggressive as the print media. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You often hear people say, "That's just politics and it doesn't really 
affect me." For those who are not political junkies, what do all these ethics 
scandals and reform efforts mean? Why is it important to them? 
</P>
<P>
A: For most people, it's not important. And it probably shouldn't be important. 
If it were really important, we would be seeing some unrest. We would be seeing 
marches on City Hall. . . . In Berlin, they tore down the wall. They're not 
tearing down City Hall. And they shouldn't be because the politicians are 
certainly much more responsive here. . . . I think most people are basically 
satisfied, but unhappy. There's a sense of something's wrong, but there's not a 
great outrage that something is so wrong that we need to overturn the system. 
</P>
<P>
Term limits are really interesting . . . sort of the responsible response (to) 
a sense that government can't respond to the problems. 
</P>
<P>
One of the big problems you have (in Los Angeles) is that they've had a mayor 
there for so many years . . . you need to get some new energy into city 
government. . . . Same thing with the Board of Supervisors. It has almost been 
a kingdom. (Supervisor) Kenny Hahn has been there for 40 years. I guess the 
most recent supervisor is (Deane) Dana in 1980, 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you think should happen next, in terms of reforms? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think what you are going to see is an extraordinary change (under the new 
law) in L.A. city government, at least in terms of the elections, and hopefully 
in terms of perceptions. . . . As of July 1 of next year, there will be no fund 
raising by City Council members for at least two years. . . . After '93, you'll 
see a two-year period where there won't be any fund raising (by any city 
official). That's an extraordinary change in the way business is conducted. You 
won't have this year-round fund raising going on. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2, City Council members and elected officials will not have any outside 
income. . . . Their (city) salary is the total salary they can receive. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3, you'll see no gifts being given by anybody appearing before the council 
or before any of the city agencies. Anybody doing business with the city can't 
be making any gifts at all. 
</P>
<P>
You'll be seeing changes in the campaign (disclosure) statements. Unless you 
get the occupation and employer of the contributor, you can't accept the money. 
. . . One of the big problems is that when you go in and read the campaign 
statements, about 50% of the (contributors') occupations and employers are not 
listed. And you don't know who these people are. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, you have this ethics commission which is given tremendous powers by 
the Charter to administer this. One of the big problems you always had was a 
question of enforcement and administration. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you ensure the commission is not a paper tiger? 
</P>
<P>
A: (The press) will be monitoring it, I hope. . . . The first danger is they 
won't be budgeted by the City Council. There's no guaranteed budget there, 
unlike the (state) Fair Political Practices Commission. We tried hard for that 
and the City Council wouldn't go along with it. The second danger is the City 
Council reviews all the (ethics) regulations. And that's not done at the state 
level either. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And finally, we have to watch the commission itself and make sure that they are 
doing the job. 
</P>
<P>
Q: The state Political Reform Act was adopted in 1974, major amendments have 
been made over the years, in 1985 the city campaign reform law was approved. 
The laws are very complex and the same kinds of problems still come up. How do 
you get at the root problems? Can you really legislate solutions? 
</P>
<P>
A: There's never an assurance. I think this new law will help, but it's not 
nirvana. I found the (state) Political Reform Act needed changing after about 
five years. I'm sure this law will need changing. 
</P>
<P>
The reason (campaign and ethics laws are) so complex is that there are so many 
potential ways to get around it. 
</P>
<P>
The other question is: Do you live within the spirit of the law? 
</P>
<P>
Willie Brown has said: You write the law and I'll follow the law, but don't 
expect me to follow the spirit of the law. . . . Basically, what he's saying is 
I'll look for all the loopholes. I think that's wrong. . . . The leader should 
be complying with the law and the spirit of the law and they should be setting 
an example and a standard.

TRIAL STARTS IN MURDER THAT SHOCKED PALISADES; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: TEEN-AGER WAS KILLED JUST DAYS BEFORE HER GRADUATION. A PRIVATE 
SECURITY GUARD IS ACCUSED OF THE CRIME.

<P>
At dawn on the eve of her high school graduation, the battered body of 
18-year-old Teak Dyer was found on the floor of a Pacific Palisades bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Before day's end, a security guard who told police he had "stumbled upon" the 
bloody scene was arrested and later charged with the murder of the young woman. 
</P>
<P>
Now, more than two years after the crime that shocked Westsiders and sparked 
efforts to tighten controls on the private security guard industry, Rodney 
Darnell Garmanian -- also charged with soliciting the murders of a judge, 
prosecutor and investigator while in custody -- is on trial for his life. 
</P>
<P>
The emotion-laden proceedings, which began last week and are expected to last 
well into next year, offer a glimpse into the less-than-storybook lifestyles of 
affluent teen-agers, the workings of an unregulated cadre of gun-toting 
security guards, and the private anguish of two sets of parents seated on 
opposite sides of the Santa Monica courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the trial was set by Deputy Dist. Atty. Lauren Weis, who told the 
six-man, six-woman jury that the victim's last night -- June 21, 1988 -- began 
as "a night of joyous celebration," capped by a Palisades High graduation party 
at the Santa Monica Pier carousel. 
</P>
<P>
"They toasted to life and their futures," the prosecutor said, as the girl's 
parents wept in the front row. "No one could know that Teak Dyer had no 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Rod Dyer, is a noted graphics artist; her mother, Jackie Dyer, 
worked as comptroller for film producer Steve Tisch before moving to Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Weis said the evidence will show that the former MacGuard night patrolman 
accosted the girl while on duty, attempted to rape her in the locked bathroom 
of the Topa Building in the Palisades village, handcuffed and beat her when she 
rebuffed his advances, and killed her with three shots from his service 
revolver to avoid arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Garmanian is charged separately with trying to arrange the contract killings of 
Los Angeles Municipal Judge David Horwitz, Deputy Dist. Atty. Harvey Giss and 
Los Angeles Police Detective John Rockwood in the fall of 1988, again, said 
Weis, "to save his own head." 
</P>
<P>
Tapes of radio transmissions on the night of the murder, and testimony from 
Garmanian's supervisor and other guards, show that he failed to maintain 
contact with his office at about the time witnesses said they heard noises 
similar to gunshots. The defendant reported finding the victim's partially nude 
body on his routine early-morning rounds by radioing, "I've got, uh, I guess, a 
187 here," a reference to state Penal Code Section 187 -- murder. 
</P>
<P>
Fingerprints of the Brentwood teen-ager were found on the passenger-side door 
of Garmanian's patrol car, a .38-caliber bullet found beneath her body was 
linked to the defendant's handgun, and several fellow guards testified to 
uncharacteristic behavior by the usually reliable man on the night of the 
murder. The co-workers added that they had noticed scratches on Garmanian's 
face and arms -- "like fingernails leave" -- after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial's first week, a heavy scratch reappeared on Garmanian's nose 
in exactly the same place shown in his booking photographs. The scratch 
worsened as the week wore on, prompting Weis to comment that the defendant's 
scratching of the spot "shows a consciousness of guilt" akin to Lady MacBeth's 
repeated attempts to wash away her "damned spot" in Shakespeare's drama. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony from the last person to see the victim alive, her 
friend, Nicole Rabin, Teak Dyer began the summer night at her mother's home, 
preparing food for the party. She and friends later drank champagne and each 
did a line of cocaine before leaving for the pier, where police broke up the 
festivities two hours later because of alcohol on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin, now 20, testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution for perjury 
and providing drugs. She said she had lied at Garmanian's preliminary hearing, 
when she said her friend had not been drinking or taking drugs, because she did 
not want to besmirch the victim's name. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy found that Dyer was legally drunk and had traces of cocaine in her 
system. Defense attorneys fought to introduce that as evidence, arguing that 
the girl may have gone willingly with Garmanian because people on coke often do 
things they would not ordinarily do, to get more drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting shot three times is not one of those," snapped Superior Court Judge 
Jacqueline Weisberg. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin said Dyer remained in the car when they stopped briefly at a friend's 
home en route to Rustic Canyon Park, where the party was to resume. It was just 
after midnight when she returned to find an empty car, and assumed that Dyer 
had left with another friend. 
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked fear and distrust among many residents of the Palisades, 
which averages less than one murder a year, and caused many to switch security 
firms or eliminate such services. Some parents began teaching their children 
how to distinguish a "real" policeman from a security guard. MacGuard Security 
Services was sold to Westec Security Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys Ezekiel Perlo and Paul Takakjian made no opening statement 
and declined to disclose their strategy. At sidebar conferences outside the 
presence of the jury, they have indicated that they may follow the lead of 
Garmanian's previous attorney, Melvin Belli, who attempted to point the finger 
at another security guard who had access to the same building. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Dyer, often beside her ex-husband, sat in the front row of the 
courtroom, hiding her eyes when blowups of her daughter's bloody body are held 
up. Like family members of many crime victims, she has found herself 
reluctantly thrust into an activist role, fighting -- unsuccessfully so far -- 
for state reforms in the screening, monitoring and accountability of security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
A MacGuard security guard testified that the firm offered little training and 
that Garmanian worked there for six months, despite complaints that he behaved 
inappropriately toward women. Earlier, the Dyer family won a $1-million 
settlement in a wrongful death suit against MacGuard and its owner. 
</P>
<P>
Across the courtroom sit the defendant's mother, Jane Garmanian of Chicago, his 
sister and his infant nephew. 
</P>
<P>
The mothers, brought together by a murder that has ruined both families' lives, 
do not acknowledge each other's presence.

LOCAL POLICE WANT CRIMINALS TO PAY THE PRICE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ASK JUDGES TO REQUIRE THAT CONVICTED OFFENDERS 
COVER MOST OF THE $1 MILLION A YEAR IN BOOKING FEES SOON TO BE CHARGED TO 
CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Area police agencies, struggling to absorb a $120 fee each time they book a 
prisoner at the Ventura County Jail, asked Monday that the burden be 
transferred to those convicted of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to presiding judges of the county courts, five police departments 
and the sheriff's department asked that criminals be forced to pay most of the 
$1 million a year in booking fees that otherwise will be charged to cities 
beginning in January. The fees are retroactive to July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"A very appealing alternative is to levy this fee against the people who have 
caused it, namely the offender," wrote Oxnard Police Chief Robert P. Owens in a 
letter from the police agencies to court officials. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin M. Osborne and Lee E. Cooper Jr., presiding judges of the superior and 
municipal courts, said they could not comment because they had neither reviewed 
the letter nor researched the legality of court-imposed booking fees for 
convicts. 
</P>
<P>
State law allows judges to fine inmates for the cost of their incarceration in 
local jails if they are convicted and can afford to pay the penalties. It is 
under this law that the police chiefs think the booking fees can be 
implemented, Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our window of opportunity," the Oxnard chief said. He was referring to 
his agency and those in Ventura, Simi Valley, Santa Paula and Port Hueneme, as 
well as the sheriff's department, which provides law enforcement services in 
the county's other five cities. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the state's largest association of criminal defense attorneys 
quickly condemned the proposal, saying it is illegal and far beyond the intent 
of the Legislature when it approved incarceration charges. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Philip Schnayerson, a spokesman for the California Attorneys for Criminal 
Justice, predicted that Ventura County's judges will embrace it. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not heard that Ventura County is the bastion of liberalism," he said. 
"I'm told it's not the Athens of the West. And I don't think those judges are 
going to be sympathetic to the absurdity of this proposal. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Despite angry objections by the cities, booking fees were approved by the 
county Board of Supervisors in September to partially offset a $6-million cut 
in state funds to the county this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Courts statewide already collect a variety of fees from criminals who are not 
destitute -- everything from levies for drug and alcohol lab tests to fees for 
public defender and probation services. The law also allows cities to recover 
from drunk drivers the cost of sending emergency equipment to the scene of an 
accident in which the drivers were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Although a decision on booking fees lies solely with judges, the courts' 
executive officer, Sheila Gonzalez, said booking fees can be collected 
efficiently here because Ventura County has a collections department, which is 
unique in the state. 
</P>
<P>
That 14-person department collected $4 million in overdue fees charged by 
judges in criminal cases last year at a cost of $500,000, she said. The office 
collected 60% of all the overdue fees, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the judges determine it is appropriate, it is very feasible that it would 
be successful," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
If judges agree to levy booking fees against criminals, Owens said he will also 
ask them to impose fines to pay his department for detention costs whether they 
lead to bookings into the County Jail or not, as long as they end in 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
That would mean, Owens said, that people who are arrested in Oxnard would have 
to pay the wages of officers who supervise them at the city police station. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the courts' interpretation of what is incarceration," Owens 
said. Theoretically, "anybody brought in here could be assessed a fee whether 
we transport them or not. That's kind of an interesting angle to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
As things stand, Oxnard faces a bill of at least $500,000 for bookings in 
1990-91 even though the Police Department has greatly expanded its program of 
giving misdemeanor criminals citations and then releasing them, Owens said 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Cmdr. Robert Brooks, supervisor of the jail, said bookings are down 
15% countywide from December of last year, presumably because of the new 
booking fees.

L.A. SCHOOLS MOVE TO REMEDY HEALTH SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District took the first step Monday toward 
revamping its school health-care program after hearing a report that criticized 
the district's 50 doctors and 500 nurses for being busier with paper work than 
medical services. 
</P>
<P>
School board members adopted the report's harsh findings and its recommendation 
that the district join forces with the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
Services to eliminate overlapping services and inefficient use of staff and 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
County officials attending Monday's meeting indicated they would be willing to 
share health-care services with the district, which is expected at its Jan. 14 
meeting to adopt a resolution seeking the county's help. 
</P>
<P>
The report said district programs are out of date and fail to meet the needs of 
students, especially those of recent immigrants who have never seen a doctor. 
Adequate services do not reach the one in five city schoolchildren who live in 
poverty and the one in three who lack medical insurance, the report also 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Compiled for the district by an educator, a health-care specialist and a 
pediatrician, the report presented a number of proposed changes that could be 
implemented starting immediately. 
</P>
<P>
If only "relatively few dollars (were) spent in school-based preventive and 
primary care, (it) would save the county enormous sums in inappropriate 
emergency care," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report also found that money to improve the district's student health-care 
program is available but the program would have to be reorganized before 
additional funding could bring improvements. 
</P>
<P>
One suggestion was for the district and the county to explore possible linkups 
with colleges, universities or medical schools to provide better health care 
for children. The Department of Nursing at Cal State Los Angeles, for instance, 
has expressed interest in jointly developing a training program to upgrade the 
skills of new school nurse practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Julie Korenstein said she was not aware that school nurses could 
be put to better use. "Frankly I was very amazed to find . . . what nurses can 
do on our campuses," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the report's recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
* Turn over responsibility for some medical services such as screening for 
tuberculosis to the county Health Department, which already performs such 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
* Install nurse practitioners in school clinics to care for children with minor 
medical problems, instead of sending such children home and having them enter 
county hospitals, which proves costly to the county. 
</P>
<P>
* Reevaluate the assignments of 320 district psychiatrists, who spend a 
significant part of their time performing tasks that do not require their 
professional expertise. 
</P>
<P>
* Restructure the jobs of the district's 50 doctors and 500 nurses so that 
doctors are able to treat more ailing students and nurses are able to prescribe 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which took one year and cost $40,000 to compile, was based on 
interviews with more than 100 medical experts, educators and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
In other business, the board said it plans early next year to review its 
expulsion policy, toughened last June to allow automatic expulsion of students 
who bring firearms to class or seriously assault others. 
</P>
<P>
Board members said they want to offer an alternative to students as young as 12 
who are currently being expelled and left to the streets because there is no 
place for them at county-run programs. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the fate of such delinquents, the board on Monday voted to 
suspend the expulsion of nine teen-agers whose cases had come up for review.

WATCHDOG GROUP CHALLENGES KCET'S LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A conservative media watchdog organization that criticized Los Angeles public 
television station KCET for airing the newsmagazine "South Africa Now" has 
asked the Federal Communications Commission not to renew the station's license. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-member Committee on Media Integrity filed a petition to deny license 
renewal with the FCC on Monday, according to its chairman, David Horowitz, a 
former '60s radical who rejected the left and co-wrote "Destructive Generation: 
Second Thoughts About the '60s." 
</P>
<P>
The petition also asks the FCC to turn down KCET's request for a new 
transmitter in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Goen, spokeswoman for KCET, said the station could not comment about 
the petition because executives there had not yet seen it. 
</P>
<P>
Under FCC rules, anyone may file a petition to deny a station its license, but 
such petitions are rarely successful. They are most often used as a tactic to 
compel a station to respond to the petitioner's complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz said his organization will withdraw the challenge if the station 
agrees to establish an elected board of directors. The group also wants the 
station to set up a paid position for an ombudsman. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz became the focus of national media attention in October, when KCET 
decided to pull "South Africa Now" for alleged bias -- a decision the station 
later rescinded -- and he claimed credit for raising the issue of the program's 
balance with station executives. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz said his organization decided to challenge KCET's license because ever 
since the "South Africa Now" controversy, members have been unable to get a 
fair hearing for their views. 
</P>
<P>
KCET's Goen disagreed with that contention, saying, "Mr. Horowitz has had an 
unprecedented amount of communication and access to KCET." SHARON BERNSTEIN

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 SISTERS ACQUITTED IN JEWELRY DISTRICT 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal court jury on Monday acquitted two sisters of conspiracy and 
money-laundering charges in a case involving "Operation Polar Cap," a massive 
drug and currency investigation focused in the jewelry district in downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors found Joyce Momjdian, 25, and Zepur Moroyan, 22, both of La 
Crescenta, not guilty of 26 charges against them in a 1989 indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The jury has now exonerated four of nine defendants in 12 days of deliberations 
and is continuing deliberations on the five other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy, very happy" said a smiling Moroyan, a receptionist, after the 
verdicts were announced in the 7-month trial. Momjdian, a bookkeeper, said she 
was scared about what the jury might do, even though "inside I knew I hadn't 
done anything." 
</P>
<P>
The two worked at Andonian Bros., a jewelry company on West 5th Street where a 
huge drug-laundering ring allegedly was centered. They said they are cousins of 
Nazareth Andonian, who is described by authorities as a key defendant in the 
case.

MISTRIAL DECLARED IN MURDER CASE 
</P>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County Superior Court judge Monday declared a mistrial for 
child-murder defendant Gregory Scott Smith and appointed new lawyers for him 
after Smith's public defenders said they also represent a key prosecution 
witness in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the conflict of interest, Judge Steven Z. Perren ordered the 
dismissal of 72 potential jurors who were already qualified to hear the 
death-penalty case. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 23, of Canoga Park, was to have been tried Jan. 8 on charges of murder, 
kidnaping and arson in the death of 8-year-old Paul Bailly of Northridge, whose 
gagged and burned body was found in a field near Simi Valley on March 23 after 
his disappearance that morning. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection was to have continued Monday. But Perren's order effectively 
postponed the trial until the spring, allowing the new court-appointed defense 
attorneys, James M. Farley and Willard P. Wiksell of Ventura, time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict that prompted the mistrial involved Tracy Ray Prell, 26, of Simi 
Valley, a jailhouse informant in the Smith case who is serving a two-year 
sentence for misdemeanor battery and obstructing a peace officer. 
</P>
<P>
The public defender's office has represented Prell in the past and would be 
forbidden from cross-examining him at trial, said Assistant Public Defender 
Duane Dammeyer. MACK REED

CONTRACT APPROVED FOR 143 CITY WORKERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Council approved a three-year contract Monday to increase the 
salaries and benefits of the city's 143 maintenance and operations workers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract negotiated with the Public Employees Assn. of Ventura 
County, the city's skilled and unskilled tradesmen and maintenance workers will 
receive a 4.5% salary increase the first year of the contract, 3.6% the second 
year and 4.5% the third year. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, which takes effect Friday, adds a vision care plan to health 
benefits provided to these city employees and their dependents. Employees will 
also receive $25 more per month from the city to help offset other health or 
medical costs. Presently, they are allotted $175 per month to pay for 
additional benefits or for dependents' health needs. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Hammitt, executive director of 6,500-member Public Employees Assn. 
chapter, said the employees were pleased with the contract that they approved 
Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
"It provides them $1,587 more in base wages alone," he said of the average 
yearly increase. "We think the salary increases will help protect them from 
inflation over the next three years." KAREN McKEAN

SHELTER PROGRAM WILL DO WITHOUT ARMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles launched a new 60-day shelter program for the homeless 
Monday, but had to find new homes for part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The National Guard, citing factors such as the Persian Gulf mobilization, 
refused to allow two armories to be converted from part-time shelters to 
nightly use. 
</P>
<P>
New shelters will be established in the San Fernando Valley at Van Nuys Airport 
and on the Westside at Stoner Park Recreation Center, officials said, replacing 
the West Los Angeles and Van Nuys National Guard armories. 
</P>
<P>
Those facilities had been designated as two of the 13 shelters in the 
three-year-old city program, which the City Council last week voted to operate 
on a continuing basis during the coldest part of the year. Previously, the 
program operated only on nights when temperatures dipped below state emergency 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The change grew out of a study that found the Van Nuys armory was used on 40 or 
more days of the 60-day cold weather period during the past two winters, and 
that other shelters were used with equal frequency, said Bob Vilmur, 
coordinator of city programs for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Officials hope that opening shelters for the entire 60 days will allow them to 
serve more homeless people and offer more and better medical and social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most humane way to do it," said Wendy Greuel, an aide to Mayor Tom 
Bradley. "We are disappointed that they did not allow us to do it this way." 
</P>
<P>
Guard commanders told Bradley's office that the armories should be used only on 
an emergency basis. The Guard cannot open the armories to the homeless for two 
months consecutively because that could lead to similar demands in colder parts 
of the state and interfere with preparations by guard units that may be called 
to duty in Operation Desert Shield, said Sgt. Phil Jordan, a spokesman for the 
California National Guard in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
City officials plan to use a hangar at Van Nuys Airport in the Valley, where 
more than 40 people have been housed at the National Guard Armory on five 
nights since Nov. 1. The Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners is expected 
Wednesday to approve the city's request to use the hangar, Vilmur said. 
</P>
<P>
The Westside homeless program will move temporarily to a recreation center in 
Stoner Park this week, Vilmur said, while program officials search for another 
facility to use until Jan. 15. The city of Santa Monica has agreed to provide a 
shelter from Jan. 15 until Feb. 15, he said.

AMBULANCE FIRMS SEEK RATE INCREASES

<P>
The three ambulance companies that serve Ventura County will ask the County 
Board of Supervisors Tuesday to allow them to charge 10% more for their 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Because the ambulance companies operate under a contract with the county, 
supervisors must approve rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1989, the board approved a 22% increase, the first jump in five years, 
county Emergency Medical Services Administrator Barbara Brofuehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura ambulance companies need to raise their fees primarily because of a 
jump in fuel prices and higher personnel costs, Brofuehrer said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, emergency transportation would increase from $232.50 to 
$256 and non-emergency transportation would jump from $175 to $193. Ambulance 
paramedic charges would go from $250 to $275. The new prices would be effective 
the day the increases are granted by the supervisors. JOEL BRAND

The body of a woman between 25 and 35 years old was discovered by a sheriff's 
deputy Monday morning off the side of California 33 between Ojai and Rose 
Valley, prompting a murder investigation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at this as a homicide," Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Joe 
Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
As of early Monday evening, the coroner's office was still attempting to 
identify the body, found fully clothed. 
</P>
<P>
The woman is described as 5 feet, 8 inches tall, with brown hair and eyes. 
Wingate estimated that the body had been at the site 12 to 24 hours. GERRY

4-DAY SEARCH FOR MISSING OFFICER WAS ROUTINE PROCEDURE, POLICE SAY; 
</P>
<P>
MANHUNT: THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ANY PRIVATE CITIZEN WITH A SIMILAR RECORD OF 
DEPENDABILITY WOULD WARRANT SUCH AN EFFORT, OFFICIALS INSIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Authorities who conducted a massive four-day search in Ventura County for a Los 
Angeles police officer, who mysteriously vanished only to turn up unharmed, 
said Monday that the manhunt was launched under routine missing person 
procedures, not because he was a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
They said the search for Sgt. Christopher Vasquez by more than 250 people was 
launched because his disappearance last week was such a departure from his work 
habits and reputation for dependability as a 20-year Los Angeles Police 
Department veteran, and because evidence at his home indicated that something 
was amiss. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision to search was not affected by who was involved," said Los Angeles 
Police Capt. Dan Watson, Vasquez's supervisor at the North Hollywood station. 
"If we are dealing with anybody who is consistent and reliable and has no 
pattern of this behavior . . . we would act the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Arve Wells, who headed the search for Vasquez, 
agreed with Watson and said the intensity of the search was no different than 
it would have been for a private citizen reported missing under similar 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The search for Vasquez, 41, began shortly after he failed to show up Dec. 10 
for his 3:30 p.m. shift as assistant watch commander. When Vasquez did not call 
in, supervisors sent officers to his townhouse in Moorpark. They found his two 
cars, a wallet and police identification, but no sign of the officer. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez, who had recently separated from his wife, was reported missing to 
Ventura sheriff's deputies. A search team began combing the hills behind the 
officer's townhouse because deputies theorized that Vasquez, an avid runner, 
might have been hurt or lost in the undeveloped area while jogging. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officers launched an immediate search. A force of 260 
people, most of whom were off-duty Los Angeles police officers or members of 
the sheriff's search team, unsuccessfully combed 45 square miles for the next 
three days until the search was suspended Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Wells said the cost of the search had not been tabulated but that the 
searchers, including many unpaid volunteers, spent 2,600 hours looking for 
Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez showed up at his estranged wife's Simi Valley home Saturday night. He 
told officers that he had hitchhiked north to Salinas because he needed time to 
think about personal problems, then hitchhiked back. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said Monday that Vasquez will undergo physical and psychological 
examinations and then a personnel investigation before authorities decide 
whether to return him to duty. Vasquez could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret that the tremendous effort was unnecessary, but, frankly, I am glad 
he turned up safely," Watson said. He praised the Ventura search team and said, 
"I apologize for the expenditure of a great amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, police receive about 60 missing person reports a week. Few 
result in organized searches, largely because experience shows that 70% of the 
reports involve people who dropped from sight voluntarily, said Detective John 
Sack of the Los Angeles Police Department's missing persons unit. Only about 5% 
of missing persons are the victims of foul play, Sack said. 
</P>
<P>
But searches are organized when investigators believe that the disappearance is 
a serious departure from the known habits of the missing person, Sack said. He 
said the search for Vasquez was not conducted because he was a police officer, 
but because he was a dependable employee with no record of missing work without 
notification. 
</P>
<P>
Sack said Vasquez's disappearance was similar to a recent case in which a West 
Los Angeles doctor did not show up for work and police immediately began a 
search involving 400 officers and volunteers in Topanga Canyon. As Vasquez did, 
the doctor later showed up unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
In the Vasquez case, police said the fact that the missing person was a police 
officer only added to the belief that he could be hurt or in some kind of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a quasi-military organization and a failure to report to work without 
notifying someone is considered a very serious matter," said Lt. Fred Nixon, a 
Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. "That signaled that there was a very 
good chance something could be wrong."

CHIEF CAN SOON JUST IGNORE THE ALARM -- CLOCK, THAT IS; 
</P>
<P>
RETIREMENTS: BOBBY HORNE IS ENDING 38 YEARS OF VENTURA FIREFIGHTING. HE WAS 
LATE TO HIS OWN FAREWELL DINNER BECAUSE HE WENT OUT ON A FIRE CALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The electronic firefighter, just one of many toys on Ventura Fire Chief Bobby 
Horne's desk, climbed to the top of the ladder, then down, then back to the 
top, as Horne pressed the controls. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only fireman that always does whatever I tell him to and never 
gives me any back talk," Horne said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
Horne, 61, has been doling out orders to the city's fire teams for much of his 
life. He's been with the Ventura department for 38 years, first as a 
firefighter, then as a captain, then as assistant fire chief and finally as 
chief for the past 13 years. Dec. 28 will be his last day at work. 
</P>
<P>
"People ask me if I'm retiring because I'm sick of the job after all these 
years. . . . I love it, but it's just time to go," said Horne, who still 
chooses to respond to many fire alarms, even though his job is administrative. 
Earlier this month, Horne was late to his own retirement dinner because he was 
responding a two-alarm fire. 
</P>
<P>
His awards are already packed away. The many toy fire engines, fire hydrants 
and other memorabilia on his desk, mostly given to him by his secretary, Nancy 
Oechsle, will be taken home soon along with the picture of Tahiti that hangs 
behind his chair. 
</P>
<P>
Horne and his wife, Lee, count Tahiti among their favorite vacation spots and 
hope to head back. The couple has also planned a trip to Germany in March. 
</P>
<P>
Horne said he'll continue his hobbies of gardening and ballroom dancing and 
maybe take up golf. "One of my most important goals is to learn how to relax," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Family and friends know the slim, gray-haired, bespectacled man as "a real 
calm, mellow person," Ventura Police Chief Richard Thomas said. But after 
almost four decades of life-and-death situations, tension and grief are not 
foreign to him. 
</P>
<P>
One episode that has haunted Horne for more than 15 years was the death of a 
small child he tried to rescue from drowning. 
</P>
<P>
"That stuck with me," Horne said. "I've seen a lot of people die. . . . But 
that little boy, I held him, I tried to help. But he died. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a traumatic event and I've suppressed it for so long. I think every 
fireman that's been around for a while has something stuck back there. You can 
psychologically deal with a lot. But once in a while, something hits you." 
</P>
<P>
Working for the Ventura Fire Department since the days of President Harry S. 
Truman, Horne has seen a lot of changes. Firefighters no longer rush into 
smoke-filled buildings without protective masks. In 1981, the Ventura 
department was the first in the county to hire a woman, he said. New technology 
in communications, Horne's pet project, has been introduced to the profession. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing that hasn't changed is the color of the department's trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of tradition. Firetrucks are red," Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
Some fire departments, including Oxnard's and the county's, use greenish-yellow 
trucks, which tests have shown are more visible at night than their red 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone hits a truck that's as big as the side of a building and has 40,000 
lights flashing and blaring all over it, it's not because that truck is red and 
not yellow," Horne said. "And if God had wanted firetrucks to be another color, 
he would have painted them that way."

ROADSIDE TREE TURNS FESTIVE EACH YEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
A December ritual continues along a stretch of California 33 between Ventura 
and Casitas Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists stop their cars on the freeway shoulder, walk to a lone pine tree 
near the Canada Larga off-ramp and hang a length of tinsel or a handwritten 
message in its branches. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weeks, the lower portion of the tree is masked with trimmings, and a 
star generally appears near the top about 50 feet above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Oak View resident Ruby Blackmon, 80, admits beginning the tradition 
about 15 years ago when the tree was just a bush. 
</P>
<P>
She keeps an eye on it each year, going out after windstorms to rehang items 
that blow off. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually undecorate it, too, as far as I can reach," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I sort things out and save them for the next year." 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon said that in 1976 Caltrans felled a tree closer to the pavement that 
she had helped trim, and the community was not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, she suspects that Caltrans crews put the star on the tree to 
make amends. 
</P>
<P>
But her theory was quashed by Bruce Dyer, Caltrans maintenance superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do anything about decorating it, and we don't do anything about 
taking it off," he said, "It just shows up. It hasn't cost us any money." 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol Officer Jim Utter warns that people who park on the 
freeway shoulder or trespass on the right of way where the tree grows risk 
citations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a violation of the Motor Vehicle Code," he said, but "don't make me look 
like a bah-humbug-Christmas guy." KATHLEEN WILLIAMS

<P>
Ojai officials are preparing to ask residents if they will need special medical 
attention or can help others in the event of a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday approved the first draft of a new pamphlet, "Plan 
to Be a Quake Survivor," with tips on what to do before, during and after an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who are willing to offer portable phones, generators, ham radios, 
medical training or ability to transport animals may list their skills or 
services on a portion of the pamphlet and mail it to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Counselors, language translators and those with tow trucks or construction 
equipment are also asked to sign up before disaster strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're motivated by our topography because the potential for isolation from 
other emergency agencies is very real here," said Elaine Willman, assistant to 
the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The brochure will be mailed to all Ojai households early next year after it is 
reviewed by the Ventura County Fire Protection District and the Sheriff's 
Department Office of Emergency Services. THIA BELL

MONROVIA FIRM'S UNIT GUIDES DESERT SOLDIERS; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: HAND-HELD SATELLITE RECEIVER CAN LOCATE TROOPS WITHIN 75 FEET. THE 
ARMY HAS ORDERED 592 FOR PERSIAN GULF OPERATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
Soldiers used to march off to battle guided only by the humble compass. But 
U.S. Army troops will soon be negotiating the Saudi Arabian desert with the 
help of $3,500 hand-held satellite receivers made in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
The Monrovia-based Magellan Systems Corp. was recently awarded a $2-million 
contract to send 592 of the devices -- about the size of a mobile phone -- to 
the Army's 1st Infantry Division, which is shipping out to the Persian Gulf 
this month from its base at Ft. Riley, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Similar devices made by other companies already are in use in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a shortage of this type of navigation system in the Army's 
inventory," said Mark Meseke, media relations officer for Ft. Riley and the 1st 
Infantry Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Army bought the devices to make sure that its soldiers would not get lost 
in the desert, he said. The receivers will be distributed among the division's 
11,500 soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
To operate the device, a soldier presses the "position" button and punches in 
his approximate latitude and longitude, within 300 miles. The correct location 
then is displayed on a small screen at the top of the receiver. The device can 
pinpoint a location within 75 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The receiver uses signals from four satellites to make its calculations. It 
provides information on longitude, latitude and altitude. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan already has delivered 240 of the portable devices, said Randy D. 
Hoffman, the company's president and chief executive officer. The rest will be 
delivered Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan also has contracts with the British Ministry of Defense and the Saudi 
Arabian frontier forces. Hoffman said France and Italy have also bought a few 
for their soldiers in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Degen, the company's sales operation manager, said Iraqi troops would be 
unable to pick up the satellite signals because they lack the receivers and the 
technological know-how. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not allowed to sell to countries that the federal government has a 
trade embargo against," Hoffman said. These countries include Iraq, Iran, North 
Vietnam, North Korea, Cuba and Libya, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan began designing the hand-held receivers for commercial use more than 
three years ago.

YOUNG GUITARIST IS STILL IN AWE OF RAPID RISE TO TOP

What a year it has been for guitarist Mark Whitfield. At this time last year, 
Whitfield, who plays two shows at Elario's tonight, was virtually unknown to 
music fans outside New York City, his home at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Then his association with such other young lions as trumpeter Wynton Marsalis 
landed him coverage in Time magazine, the New York Times and other prestige 
publications -- just in time for the release of his first album, "The 
Marksman," in September. 
</P>
<P>
The album is getting raves from critics who appreciate Whitfield's mature and 
restrained continuation of jazz guitar traditions that began with Charlie 
Christian and continued through Wes Montgomery, Grant Green, Jim Hall, George 
Benson and others. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Whitfield, just 24, is enjoying a heady brand of success as one of the 
newest members of a nationally acclaimed traditional jazz brat pack. He toured 
Japan last month with singer Carmen McRae, and television appearances are 
booked with Johnny Carson, Arsenio Hall and David Letterman. Whitfield has also 
taped a "Nightline" program, hosted by closet jazz guitarist Forest Sawyer and 
featuring a Whitfield duet with Benson. 
</P>
<P>
All that attention could go to a young man's head, but Whitfield takes it in 
stride, keeping his reverence for the legends who came before him. To him, they 
are like gods. 
</P>
<P>
"It's taken so much studying and appreciation of the founding fathers of jazz 
to get where I am that, along the way, I've fallen in love with all of their 
music, personalities, contributions," he said. "I hold them most high in my own 
estimation of their contribution to the art. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was Freddie Hubbard's age and grew up in the '60s, I might look at them 
differently -- to stand there and talk to 'Trane is different than to revere 
him and study his music 20 years after he's dead. Us young guys think of these 
people as superhuman, and their contribution as being priceless." 
</P>
<P>
Whitfield's smooth, melodic style shows amazing polish for someone his age, yet 
he doesn't showboat his talents. He also stands out for being a jazz purist 
among peers whose music mirrors broader influences ranging from rock to rap. He 
has consciously honed his approach in another direction. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first went to Berklee (a music school), I was 16, and all I could do 
was play really fast," Whitfield said. "I went through a period where I liked 
to play like Hendrix, and I listened to '70s rock bands like Aerosmith, and 
rap. I had played a lot of classical music on acoustic bass, and I had strength 
in my fingers. I spent three or four years working on playing fast, and I got 
known just for playing fast. 
</P>
<P>
"But my parents are real big jazz fans, and they would take me to see Basie, 
Ellington, Joe Pass. I knew there was something different about jazz musicians 
and their virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to have a knowledge of theory and harmony like a classical player but 
be able to improvise. I realized there wasn't much lyricism, soul or expression 
in my playing. I knew I'd have to take a strong approach scholastically to 
learn the music and history. I felt that, to get a strong foundation, I had to 
go right to the source. 
</P>
<P>
"When I joined (organist, composer) Jack McDuff's band, I began to pay 
attention to Wes Montgomery, realizing that less is a lot more in most 
settings. I can certainly play fast whenever I want, but it's easier to develop 
a sound, a style, if you handle solos as conversations. They need an intro, a 
climax and an exit. That's what I had to start developing. I was just getting 
to that when we started recording the record last April and May." 
</P>
<P>
For his debut, Whitfield mixed a few of his favorite jazz tunes by other 
composers, including Ellington's "In a Sentimental Mood," with six of his own 
songs. He recorded with Marsalis' rhythm section: Marcus Roberts on piano, 
Reginald Veal on bass and Herlin Riley on drums. 
</P>
<P>
According to Whitfield, the sound on the album was carefully tailored with the 
help of veteran producer Tommy LiPuma to make a strong first impression that 
doesn't reflect the full diversity of his playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to develop something that hadn't been messed with much in a quartet 
setting," he said. "I didn't do much chord work, and I played relaxed, not 
fast. I kind of tried to set a mood like a singing horn." 
</P>
<P>
Like, say, 1960s Miles Davis? 
</P>
<P>
"That's along the lines of what I was thinking, Whitfield said. "Marcus and 
those guys bring that sound to life. 
</P>
<P>
"When you come to see me play, though, I'll do something with my thumb like Wes 
Montgomery, then some solo music like Joe Pass. I might even play Charlie 
Christian's 'Air Mail Special.' When you're playing live, there's more time to 
develop a show and an audience and a sound than on record." 
</P>
<P>
To reach a larger audience, Whitfield reworked some of his music to gain 
exposure on light jazz stations, including KIFM (98.1) in San Diego. Three 
songs were edited to commercial radio length -- under four minutes -- which cut 
two of them virtually in half. 
</P>
<P>
"Marcus will be mad. A few of his solos disappeared," Whitfield said. "Sitting 
there and chopping up the music was painful, but it does pay off in the end. 
Stations in New York, L.A., throughout the country are playing it. Even some of 
the rap stations are playing the edited versions." 
</P>
<P>
Whitfield's one night in San Diego is part of a West Coast tour that will take 
him to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle later this month, then back to 
Catalina's in Los Angeles for a week with Carmen McRae in January. 
</P>
<P>
Pass is in town for the second of two weeks at Elario's, and he and Whitfield 
are acquaintances, so it's not out of the question that Pass might join 
Whitfield for a song or two. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to hang out with him at the Blue Note in New York last summer, and we 
fooled around and jammed," said Whitfield, who now lives in Baton Rouge, La. 
"He's a genius. I've always been a big fan of his solo playing and trio work. I 
wanted to soak up the things he did that made his style unique."

'CYRANO' A MOST HANDSOME FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The glorious new "Cyrano de Bergerac" (opening today at the Royal) brings 
together the right man -- Gerard Depardieu -- at the right time of his life and 
career with one of the juiciest roles in European drama, one he was born to 
play. And with precisely the right nose. 
</P>
<P>
What could be a better harbinger of the pleasures to come than the perfection 
of this Cyrano's nose? Depardieu's already generous proboscis has not been 
built out all that much; it's been expanded into the Jimmy Durante schnozolla 
range and boasts a Bob Hope ski slope. It's just outsized enough to obsess a 
vain, brilliant man like Cyrano, but not so big as to be all-out Pinocchio 
freakish. This allows us to perceive that Cyrano sees himself as a beast far 
more than we do, which gives fresh meaning and poignancy to Edmond Rostand's 
hero, who has enchanted audiences around the world for 93 years. 
</P>
<P>
A poll once revealed that Cyrano is France's favorite literary character, 
beating out even Jean Valjean and D'Artagnan. This makes perfect sense. Most of 
us, rightly or wrongly, are less than thrilled by our looks and have 
experienced unrequited love, which inevitably carries with it the desire to 
make it bearable by romanticizing it. 
</P>
<P>
Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau, who adapted the play for the screen with 
Jean-Claude Carriere, one of the most distinguished of screenwriters, doesn't 
bring on the object of Cyrano's secret adoration, his cousin Roxane, played by 
witty, heart-stopping beauty Anne Brochet, until we're well into the 138-minute 
film. Rappeneau is being neither digressive nor draggy; to the contrary, he 
wants to sweep us up and immerse us in his lusty, exuberant evocation of 
17th-Century France, a world of elegance and earthiness, grandeur and squalor. 
Have no fear: This "Cyrano" is a film of dash and vigor, an exceptionally 
graceful adaptation of a play for the screen. 
</P>
<P>
How appropriate that the film begins in a theater, for Cyrano is the most 
theatrical of men yet also a poet, playwright and critic as well as a career 
military man. Arriving fashionably late and undetected, he suddenly appears in 
a high balcony box to denounce the old ham declaiming away on stage. In the 
ensuing mayhem (eagerly anticipated by the audience), Cyrano ends up prepared 
to duel anyone so foolish as to mock his nose. Gradually, we come to see the 
perceptive, lonely creature beneath the bravado. You can already envision an 
Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, a la "Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
The one man who gets away with making fun of that nose is the handsome 
Christian de Neuvillette (Vincent Perez), but then, he is Roxane's suitor and 
at her request has arrived to join Cyrano's regiment. Although a wit in verbal 
parrying with Cyrano, Christian admits to becoming tongue-tied in expressing 
love and admiration for women. In one of the most famous instances of vicarious 
love in all of literature, Cyrano is soon writing Christian's love letters to 
Roxane, who swoons in response, and is coaching him in his pursuit. All that 
has gone before and all that is to come -- including the battle of Arras -- 
provides a turbulent, large-scale backdrop for the disguised expression of 
Cyrano's consuming love for Roxane and its consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Within this most extravagant of romantic gestures that Rostand created for his 
tormented hero, the filmmakers and the actors express the full range of human 
nature. Cyrano is at once noble and self-sacrificing yet self-aggrandizing and 
-dramatizing as well. For more than 15 years, Depardieu has been establishing 
himself as a premier actor of his generation, right up there with Robert De 
Niro, his co-star in Bertolucci's "1900." Cyrano taps Depardieu's incredible 
inner reserves, his passion, intellect and physicality, and he has the strength 
and presence to sustain one of the most drawn out death scenes of all time, 
showing us at once Cyrano's vaunting gallantry and monumental, outrageous 
egoism. There is complexity and intelligence in Perez's Christian and Brochet's 
Roxane, too; they are not beautiful blanks but reflective individuals with 
their own emotional capacities. There's also a delightful comic portrayal from 
Jacques Weber as another of Roxane's suitors, a middle-aged nobleman and 
self-deluded poseur who has the pomposity knocked out of him in battle. 
</P>
<P>
This "Cyrano" (rated PG) is well-nigh flawless, with scarcely a moment's lull. 
Legions of people both in front and in back of Pierre Lhomme's effortlessly 
fluid camera have striven successfully to make the past seem to be happening in 
the present. In addition to Lhomme, whose palette is muted and luminous, 
principal contributions are Franca Squarciapino's period-perfect settings and 
costumes that seem lived in, and Jean-Claude Petit's full-bodied score. Anthony 
Burgess' fine English subtitles even go so far as to translate Rostand's verses 
whenever feasible. And let's not overlook Michele Burke, who designed that 
wonderful nose for Cyrano.

'JOURNEY OF LOVE' ON A SEA OF MEMORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Journey of Love" (at the Beverly Center Cineplex) is a warm and gentle Italian 
film in which a sturdy elderly couple (Omar Sharif and Lea Massari), after 40 
years of procrastinating, abruptly decide to take off -- on foot yet -- for the 
Adriatic Sea, which they have never seen. 
</P>
<P>
As they follow the course of the river from their dying mountain village, they 
find the past washing over them, yielding mainly happy memories but also, not 
surprisingly, uncovering a few regrets and guilts. 
</P>
<P>
Since this is a sunny film with virtually no action and few incidents, director 
Ottavio Fabbri, his distinguished veteran writer Tonino Guerra and the stars 
have no small challenge in sustaining interest. For the most part they succeed, 
although the film could lose about 10 minutes and probably be only the better 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
What the filmmakers beautifully evoke through the couple's journey is an aura 
of reconciliation -- with life, nature and mortality. 
</P>
<P>
Sharif has been doing some of his best work in recent years, much of it in 
Europe, some of it in his native Egypt, where he was a top romantic star before 
being cast by David Lean in "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Dr. Zhivago." However, 
virtually none of Sharif's recent films have surfaced in general release in the 
United States. Now silver-haired, he remains as handsome and dashing as ever, 
even in the humble villager's clothing of this film. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Massari, who first came to international attention as the young 
woman who disappeared in Antonioni's "L'Avventura" (1961), has been seen little 
in America since she played the seductive mother in Louis Malle's "Murmur of 
the Heart" (1971). Under the gray wig, padded clothing and creepy eyelid makeup 
of the simple old woman she plays here, Massari remains as vibrant and sensual 
as ever. She and Sharif clearly have lots of fun playing this adorable couple a 
generation older than they actually are. 
</P>
<P>
Much of "Journey of Love" (Times-rated Mature for one brief nude scene) 
consists of a trek through some glorious countryside, photographed in muted 
earth tones by Mauro Marchetti. Along the way, they encounter a philosophical 
old priest (Ciccio Ingrassia), and, in effective counterpoint to their journey, 
we watch unfold a near-silent vignette in which a beautiful young woman 
(Florence Guerin) comes to terms with the loss of her handsome truck-driver 
fiance (Stephane Bonnet) to another woman. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the sentimental pleasures of this endearing little movie is Andrea 
Guerra's romantic score with its waltz theme.

PHOTOGRAPHY: A DUANE MICHALS RETROSPECTIVE AT A SAN DIEGO MUSEUM MAKES A STRONG 
IMPRINT ON THE PSYCHE.

<P>
Perhaps it is just coincidence that the simple title of "The Duane Michals 
Show" seems more fitting to a comedy hour than a 30-year museum retrospective 
of a New York photographer. But images of, say, Howdy Doody, persist when a 
visitor is faced with a blow-up self-portrait of Michals using head and hands 
to make a shadow image of a duck on the wall behind him at the entrance to his 
show at the Museum of Photographic Arts in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Guileless and often goofy, Michals seems contented to leave a first impression 
of himself as an entertainer in this first American survey of his work. But as 
the more than 200 black-and-white photographs quickly show, Michals is much 
more. A mix of portraits and multi-image narratives with short written texts, 
this wonderful show combines humor with nostalgia, religious commentary, astute 
social observation and personal fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
A bluntness and modesty pervade this work, a simplicity that leaves each viewer 
to go further beyond the surface. To project and extrapolate. To be swept up in 
the nostalgia, without being trapped in sweetness. To keep an eye on the 
gimmick inherent in the medium, while still appreciating its enormous power. 
</P>
<P>
An early work sets the tone of surrealist quasi-religious symbolism and 
photographic manipulation that remains consistent throughout: "The Illuminated 
Man," 1968, shows a shadowy man whose head has been transformed into a 
featureless, glowing flash of light. "I Met God in the Subway," 1990 -- the 
latest here -- takes the same theme further: A man is shown riding the New York 
subway, his head lit from behind to look like a halo. Just below, the artist 
has written: "I met God in the subway/He looked like you and me/I asked which 
train went to Heaven/He said take number three./When I got off in Heaven/It 
looked like Union Square/Seems when you go to Heaven/You don't go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Constantly questioning reality in art and in life, in both of these works 
Michals plays the mysterious powers of manipulation available to the 
photographer against the mysticism of religion. Calling himself a "lapsed 
Catholic," Michals has spoken often of his devoutly religious childhood. A 
sense of paradise lost governs much of his work, imbued with a nostalgia for 
the transcendent visions that can come through faith. There is a slightly 
mocking tone to such quasi-religious work, but it is dryly mixed with the 
possibility of optimism. That Heaven and Earth are equal, that death does not 
transcend life. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1932 in blue-collar McKeesport, Pa., a Pittsburgh suburb that was also 
the birthplace of Andy Warhol, Michals has made many works that appear directly 
autobiographical. His unresolved relationship with his father is often a 
subject. Among these, one of the most subtle, yet most poignant, is the 1978 
"Self Portrait Shaking Hands With My Father." 
</P>
<P>
In a barren room, the two men shake hands at the extreme right side of the 
photo and the contrast between them is striking. The older man, slightly bent 
from age, wears a somewhat rumpled suit, a mark of formality that hides the 
fact that he is a retired factory worker. The younger Michals wears a dark 
turtleneck, casually formal as would befit an artist. In their handshake is the 
symbol of resolution, across what appears to be significant distance. An open 
door at the left of the picture appears as an escape route from these powerful 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Death comes up often in Michals' work, too, with a sense of both sorrow and 
curiosity yet never morbidity. "Hamlet's" Yorick, for example, is remembered in 
a memento mori picture of a young man holding a skull. Scrawled below in the 
artist's rough hand is a short poem "All Things Mellow in the Mind . . . ." 
about the brevity of life. "So let's hold tight, and touch and feel," Michals 
wrote. "For this quick instant we are real." 
</P>
<P>
There are lighter moments, too, belying Michals' Pop background and his links 
to a post-modern real-life metaphysic similar to that found in the work of such 
artists as John Baldessari and Edward Ruscha, among others. A group of 
exquisite celebrity portraits -- many of them commercial work done for 
magazines -- starts the show. Some are of well-known artists, like a rare pair 
of portraits of Joseph Cornell, as well as images of Warhol, Marcel Duchamp and 
Rene Magritte. Others are of movie and arts stars: Dennis Hopper lounging on 
the floor in a smoke-filled room, Joe Dallesandro as a gargoyle on a New York 
rooftop and a beautiful but apparently narcissistic Russian ballerina, Ludmila 
Tscherina, shown just in the circular frame of a hand-held mirror in a 
photograph from 1964. 
</P>
<P>
And the narrative can be both sweet and borderline cute, like children's book 
illustrations. One well-known work shows a child who looks up at a coat and hat 
hanging on a rack, then falls asleep and dreams the bogey man has come to life. 
</P>
<P>
A series of forays into painting show the artist painting on top of vintage 
photographs, obliterating the precious images of photographic masters with 
colorful, childlike imagery. Here, Michals exhibits a bad-boy daring 
reminiscent of Robert Rauchenberg's erasure of a Willem DeKooning drawing. 
</P>
<P>
Michals' 1989 work, too, takes a tongue-in-cheek jab at the pretentions of 
photography. "There Are Nine Mistakes in This Photograph" shows a man reading 
an upside down newspaper with an upside down top hat on his head, sitting 
across a breakfast table from a blindfolded girl eating cake, among other 
foolishness. "Can you find them?" the picture teases. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, all of Michals' art seems immediately accessible. A renegade 
from the seriousness of both fine art photography and photojournalism, Michals 
makes it all seem easy. But, again, there is more than meets the eye. Lighting 
and darkroom techniques often add enormous subtlety to the beauty of the 
prints.

RICK DU BROW: HOLIDAY SEASON A TV PARADISE FOR FILM BUFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

TV or not TV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
RETAKES: It's movie-buff heaven on TV during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
For the next few weeks, old and new classics will pour forth -- for example, 
"From Here to Eternity," on both cable's TBS and KCOP Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
TBS offers the film -- with Montgomery Clift, Burt Lancaster, Deborah Kerr, 
Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed -- on Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
It's part of a weeklong TBS package that also includes "Sergeant York" on 
Monday, "Casablanca" on Christmas and "On the Waterfront" on Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
KCOP, meanwhile, airs "From Here to Eternity" at midnight on New Year's Eve as 
the first entry of a commercial-free day of top films, ending with Jack 
Nicholson in "Chinatown." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's "My Left Foot," with Daniel Day-Lewis' Academy Award-winning 
performance, which turns up on Cinemax on Thursday, Christmas Day and Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
And you can also catch Judy Garland in "Meet Me in St. Louis" Thursday at 5 
p.m. on TNT. 
</P>
<P>
VCR owners -- on your mark. 
</P>
<P>
MODERN TIMES: With KTTV Channel 11 airing the Rose Parade without commercials, 
and KCOP offering its sponsor-free film festival, New Year's Day is a fine 
example of the impact of cable and VCRs on traditional TV. 
</P>
<P>
BOX OFFICE: NBC's 83rd-place rating with a documentary about Robert Redford 
showed again that movie stars may be swell on TV in motion pictures, but they 
don't draw much in television projects. TV creates its own stars. 
</P>
<P>
HEAVY: Not many performers captured the spirit of film noir more than the 
wonderful Mike Mazurki, who died the other day but remains unforgettable as the 
pathetic goon Moose Malloy in the 1944 Philip Marlowe tale "Murder, My Sweet." 
Catch it when it's rerun. 
</P>
<P>
DRAWING BOARD: Tough guy Ray Sharkey in a sitcom? Intriguing. He's made an ABC 
pilot for a backup series tentatively called "The Ray Sharkey Show," playing a 
street hustler who makes a death-bed promise to his father to take care of the 
family, running a grocery. "He's very imposing, very close to the character," 
says creator Ed. Weinberger. 
</P>
<P>
TWIST OF FATE: We were shocked -- shocked -- to see Josie (Joan Chen) suddenly 
become a virtual slave to Catherine (Piper Laurie) on Saturday's "Twin Peaks." 
Don't fall for all the cult malarkey that you have to see every minute of "Twin 
Peaks" to really enjoy it. We watch it just when we can, and it's a hoot any 
old time. 
</P>
<P>
THOUGHT FOR THE DAY: After Madonna's "Nightline" interview, the Jay Leno camp 
was wondering: "What's next -- a Persian Gulf special on the 'Tonight' show?" 
</P>
<P>
CHECKERBOARD: NBC's upcoming move to sandwich "Night Court" and "Seinfeld" 
between "Unsolved Mysteries" and "Hunter" on Wednesdays looks good on paper. 
And who could ask for more perfect continuity than comedian Jerry Seinfeld 
leading into Fred Dryer of "Hunter"? 
</P>
<P>
MOVING TARGET: Does NBC's planned move of "Dear John" to Saturdays at 10:30 
p.m., replacing "American Dreamer," mean that the network feels the Judd Hirsch 
sitcom has just about run out of steam? 
</P>
<P>
DECISIONS, DECISIONS: Foolish of CBS to cancel its Charles Kuralt-Lesley Stahl 
late-hour entry, "America Tonight," as of Jan. 18. It wasn't doing that badly 
in the ratings considering CBS' late-night, station-clearance problem. And CBS' 
11:30 p.m. replacement against "Tonight" and "Nightline," starting Jan. 21, is 
a group of action-adventure series -- the same formula that flopped before. 
</P>
<P>
TYPECAST: Really, Anita Morris is much too good to be stuck in another of those 
routine sex-bomb roles in which she turned up in CBS' "WIOU." 
</P>
<P>
VALUES: Now, let's see, local TV has plenty of room for "Inside Edition" and "A 
Current Affair," but there's no place for "Teen Talk," the prize-winning series 
canceled by KCAL Channel 9. Well, there should be. It'll only bring honor to 
whoever picks it up. 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCH: The 50-and-over crowd has latched on to NBC's strong Tuesday lineup 
of "Matlock," "In the Heat of the Night" and "Law and Order," which could turn 
out to be the network's most successful new series. 
</P>
<P>
DOUBLE TAKE: "Matlock" star Andy Griffith turns up in his old life Christmas 
Day -- on another channel -- when TBS launches the first of its fully restored 
episodes of "The Andy Griffith Show." The episode, "The Christmas Story," which 
co-stars Don Knotts, airs at 3:35 p.m. Other shows from the 1960-68 series will 
be rerun for a month starting New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
SILVER LINING: CBS, looking for some good news, must have taken heart from how 
well its two recent "Face to Face With Connie Chung" specials did in the 
ratings. Even the one on Thanksgiving night, when viewers usually tune out, 
scored nicely. 
</P>
<P>
SLEUTH: Great premise: 1930s private eye does research for famous writers like 
Hemingway and Faulkner for their Hollywood scripts. Fiction, of course. Arts 
&amp; Entertainment is doing it as a series, with Tony Peck (Greg's son) as the 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
DROPOUTS: No network scored big this fall, but NBC hollered loudest about its 
new shows, so it must be shaken by the fast flop of such entries as "Ferris 
Bueller," "Parenthood," "Working It Out," "The Fanelli Boys" and "Hull High." 
</P>
<P>
TURNABOUT: Would you believe that NBC, once the cutting-edge network, now is 
third behind ABC and CBS in drawing the pivotal young audience of men between 
18 and 49? 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: "I know how to do anything -- I'm a mom." Roseanne Barr in 
"Roseanne."

Say good night, Gracie. . . .

PBS PRIMER ON SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like last week's "Frontline" report on "The Struggle for South Africa," PBS' 
"The Death Throes of Apartheid" (tonight at 10 on KCET Channel 28) shows that 
PBS is beginning to seriously unpeel the complex onion that is South Africa. It 
is in some ways a better primer for the newcomer to the issue than the 
outstanding BBC-produced "Frontline" edition. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, "Death Throes," perhaps reflecting the fact that it was produced 
by Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service and hosted by the school's 
dean, Peter F. Krogh, gives us a map of South Africa's splintered face. 
</P>
<P>
It zooms in on three distinct regions -- the Natal province and its KwaZulu 
homeland, the Capetown metropolitan area and the central Orange Free State 
province -- to examine a nation trying to free itself of a 300-year legacy of 
racial strife and economic feudalism. 
</P>
<P>
Amidst the myriad factions and deep alphabet soup, certain patterns emerge in 
Krogh's report. While President F.W. deKlerk's government and Nelson Mandela's 
African National Congress (ANC) are trying to jump-start their 
on-again-off-again negotiations, each faces tough opponents. 
</P>
<P>
DeKlerk may lose his right flank to the growing Conservative Party, which 
demands to be part of the negotiations (the paramilitary right could be 
serious, but appear here to be overfed white men playing soldier). 
</P>
<P>
The ANC may lose its left to the anti-capitalist Pan-African Congress (PAC), 
whose "colored," or mixed-race leader, Barney Desai, calls for a national 
redistribution of wealth and laments that "apartheid is alive and well." 
</P>
<P>
Both Desai and the Conservatives ask whom the negotiating parties are 
representing, as does Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, whose fellow Zulus are 
now in locked combat with ANC supporters. This could be dismissed as so much 
opportunistic cynicism, except that delegates at the ANC's conference last 
weekend asked the same of Mandela. In a sense, "Death Throes" is already dated, 
as South Africa's onion layers get thicker and thicker.

'HOME' IS ALL ALONE IN FIRST PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Kid stars dramatically upstaged superstars Robert Redford and Cher at the 
weekend box office, as a trio of youth-oriented titles led by the runaway hit 
"Home Alone" topped the charts with combined ticket sales of more than $27 
million. (See box-office chart, F2.) 
</P>
<P>
"Mermaids," the first film from Cher since her '87 Academy Award-winning 
performance in "Moonstruck," drew opening weekend ticket sales of $3.5 million 
on 920 screens, for a weak per-screen average of $3,820, and sixth place. 
</P>
<P>
"Havana," which marks the seventh teaming of Redford and director Sydney 
Pollack -- following the 1985 Oscar winner "Out of Africa" -- had opening 
weekend receipts of $2.2 million on 824 screens, for a disappointing per-screen 
average of $2,640, and ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, first place again went to 20th Century Fox's family comedy "Home 
Alone." Starring Macaulay Culkin as a plucky 8-year-old who must defend the 
homestead when he's inadvertently left home alone for the holidays, the film 
earned $11.6 million on 2,017 screens for a per-screen average of $5,760. After 
five weeks' release, it has now grossed $99.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Star Pictures' "Look Who's Talking Too" grabbed second place with receipts 
of $8.1 million. The sequel to last year's fall sleeper, this one about a trio 
of wise-cracking toddlers who "speak" via voice-overs by Bruce Willis, Roseanne 
Barr and Damon Wayans, opened at 1,576 theaters where it averaged $5,140 per 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's comedy-drama "Edward Scissorhands," directed by Tim Burton 
("Beetlejuice," "Batman") and starring Johnny Depp as an extraordinary young 
man with scissors for hands, was third with ticket sales of $6.3 million. In 
its first week of wide release on 1,023 screens, the film had a per-screen 
average of $6,183. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere among the Top 10: "Dances With Wolves" (Orion Pictures) was fourth 
with $4.5 million; "Misery" (Columbia Pictures), fifth, $4 million; "The 
Rookie" (Warner Bros.), seventh, $3.5 million; "Three Men and a Little Lady" 
(Buena Vista), eighth, $2.7 million; "Predator II" (Fox), tenth, $1.2 million.

'LIFESTORIES' SPONSORS MAY DRAW FIRE FROM CHRISTIAN GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he had yet to see tonight's episode of "Lifestories," Rev. Donald 
Wildmon, a leading proponent of boycotts of corporations that advertise on TV 
shows that some Christian organizations find objectionable, hinted that its 
sponsors might find themselves on his hit list. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem with the depiction of the treatment of AIDS in a realistic 
manner," Wildmon said from his office in Tupelo, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem I have with the networks is that every program that I know of 
depicts homosexuality as a positive, normal, acceptable, approved, alternative 
lifestyle, and that is not in harmony with what the overwhelming majority of 
the American people believe. 
</P>
<P>
"If the message is not included in there that the best way to avoid AIDS is to 
refrain from homosexual activity, then I think the program is seriously 
deficient and harmful to the very people they are trying to help." 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon is the executive director of Christian Leaders for Responsible 
Television (CLeaR-TV) and president of the American Family Assn., which monitor 
television for what Wildmon calls "sexual immorality, violence, positive 
portrays of homosexuals, hedonism, materialism and anti-Christian bigotry." 
They identify advertisers and organize boycotts against those that are deemed 
to be heavy sponsors of such programs. 
</P>
<P>
Wildmon said that his organizations are tracking all programs that 
sympathetically depict the gay lifestyle and will identify the leading sponsor 
of such programs. Asked if he will then call for a boycott, Wildmon replied, 
"That's what we're known for." STEVE WEINSTEIN

49ERS STRIKE BACK AT RAMS, 26-10; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: SAN FRANCISCO TAKES CONTROL WITH 16-0 LEAD. AT 5-9, L.A. IS 
MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED FROM PLAYOFFS. 
</P>

<P>
The San Francisco 49ers, Big Nickel-ed and dimed to death by the Rams only 
three weeks ago, performed a little math lesson for their inferiors Monday 
night in front of a national audience that is used to these 49er 
teacher-student sessions. 
</P>
<P>
One superstar quarterback plus one superstar wide receiver plus one darting 
young running back plus a surging defense equals a Super Bowl contender, just 
about any season you want. 
</P>
<P>
Even subtracting 49er all-pro safety Ronnie Lott, all that added up to a 26-10 
defeat for the Rams (5-9) and the mathematical end to any of their far-fetched 
playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
The team that came into the preseason called "the Second-Best Team in Football" 
probably won't even be the second-best team that doesn't make the playoffs this 
season, while the best team in football keeps on besting everybody. And the 
Rams will second that proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
"They just show you what championship-level is," Ram Coach John Robinson said 
of the 49ers. "They cover for an injured player very well." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, after stopping the 49ers at Candlestick Park with an imaginative 
four-safety "Big Nickel" defensive scheme, were just another bump on the road 
Monday night. And the 49ers do love the road -- this victory made it 17 in a 
row on the road and nine of their last 10 in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
You can confuse the 13-1 49ers once, spoil their shot at a perfect season with 
defensive tricks and gadgets and big plays, but Joe Montana and Jerry Rice and 
all the rest aren't about to be swept. They do their own sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night marked Montana's ninth consecutive victory in Anaheim, his own 
personal Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
This time the difference was two big 49er offensive plays -- a 60-yard scoring 
pass from Montana to Rice and a 74-yard burst by rookie runner Dexter Carter -- 
and a relentless defense that separated the NFL's best from one of its most 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's run was the longest touchdown run in the NFC this season. And it was 
an almost perfect duplication of last week's game-turning 67-yard dash around 
the left side by New Orleans runner Gill Fenerty as Ram safety Vince Newsome 
again took the wrong angle on the runner. 
</P>
<P>
"Last time we played them, they didn't get the big plays," Robinson said. 
"Their two big plays in the game tonight were pretty much the difference." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams got no game-shaking big plays of their own against a scrappy 49er 
defense that was missing a Lott but not missing a beat. Ram quarterback Jim 
Everett completed 17 of his 35 passes for 232 yards and was intercepted twice, 
and the Rams managed only 53 rushing yards in 19 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the 49ers piled up 173 rushing yards in 36 tries -- thanks mainly 
to Carter's 124 yards in 13 carries. The Rams dared the 49ers to run again, 
using variations of six-back and seven-back defensive sets, but not only did 
the 49ers run, Montana found open passing lanes where last meeting he did not. 
</P>
<P>
After Carter blew past the Rams' defense early in the fourth quarter to 
transform a 19-10 game into a 26-10 laugher, the Rams' season was over, with 
two meaningless games left. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams, who have been pounded in their three nationally televised night 
games this season and still have one left, said they will charge on this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought we'd dig ourselves out of the hole, but we never did," tackle 
Jackie Slater said. "The good thing about team sports is that, at times like 
this, you can find a bright side. I can look at my teammates, look them in the 
eye, and see no quit there." 
</P>
<P>
They may not have quit, but the Rams were pushed around by the 49ers from the 
opening kickoff until the final gun. The Rams did not force the 49ers to punt 
until less than two minutes remained in the third quarter, and Everett didn't 
complete his second pass of the night until the game was well into the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers started the scoring on their second possession, using their patented 
short-passing game to march for more than five minutes down to the Rams' 
five-yard before settling for Mike Cofer's 23-yard field goal. Montana 
completed five straight at one point, dinking and dunking to Rice and John 
Taylor on quick hits over the middle and his backs flying out to the flats. 
</P>
<P>
On their next possession, the 49ers swallowed up 9:03 in 15 plays, scoring on 
fullback Tom Rathman's one-yard dive on fourth and goal. The 49ers converted 
three third downs and the one fourth-down try on the drive, but failed on the 
extra-point attempt when the snap was low and two 49ers ran into each other 
vying for holder Barry Helton's pass. That made it 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-and-out Ram possession, the 49ers did it the quick way: a 60-yard 
pass to Rice streaking down the left sideline past Jerry Gray and Anthony 
Newman for a 16-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams mustered up a challenge as the half ticked down, moving 78 yards on a 
long drive of their own. Rookie wide receiver Derrick Faison caught the first 
touchdown pass of his NFL career to cap the drive, a perfectly thrown 
eight-yard lob by Everett over cornerback Darryl Pollard, closing the score to 
16-7. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, after starting out one for eight, completed four of his five passes on 
the drive, for 71 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their defense turned it up a notch, and we just couldn't score," 
Robinson said. "We just couldn't sustain it enough." 
</P>
<P>
With the 49ers' defense harrying Everett into hurried throws and with the 
49ers' secondary -- led by free safety Dave Waymer and cornerback Don Griffin 
-- swarming all over the timing patterns the Rams usually hit to Henry Ellard 
and Flipper Anderson with ease, the Rams' defense was under intense pressure to 
stuff the 49ers' offense. Too much pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Rams started the second half by fumbling away a snap on the second 
play of the third quarter to set up Cofer's second field goal of the night, a 
31-yarder to push the 49ers' lead to 19-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams came back with Lansford's chip shot field goal to narrow it to 19-10 
late in the third, but Carter's gallop came just as the final period began. 
</P>
<P>
When did it hit the Rams that they were absolutely out of the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
"When we walked in here right after the game and looked at each other," Pete 
Holohan said. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ram inside linebacker Frank Stams suffered a right knee sprain in the first 
quarter and did not play after returning for one play. He will be examined this 
morning for possible cartilage damage. Guard Tom Newberry sprained his left 
ankle in the first half and rookie Bern Brostek played at his spot the rest of 
the way. Safety Vince Newsome suffered a left shoulder contusion. . . . 
Fumble-prone tailback Cleveland Gary did not get into the game until eight 
minutes remained in the third quarter, carried three times for 11 yards, caught 
two passes and did not fumble. Gaston Green started in his place and gained 34 
yards in 12 carries. Gary had no comment when asked about his playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Rams were logically thrust from the playoff race after last 
month's loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Monday night's loss put the mathematical 
finishing touches on the season. The best the Rams can finish is 7-9, which 
would at best tie them with the Dallas Cowboys. Because the Rams lost their 
game against the Cowboys and also cannot finish with a better conference record 
than Dallas, the Rams cannot gain the one NFC wild-card berth still up for 
grabs. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams also clinched their first losing record under John Robinson since 
1987, and their first losing record in a non-strike season in Robinson's eight 
years as coach.

FLASHES IN PAN PUT RAMS INTO THE FIRE AGAIN

They meet in November and a perfect season ends. 
</P>
<P>
They meet in December and a season ends perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
When the math finally caught up Monday night with what was general knowledge a 
month ago, at least the Rams got to name their poison. 
</P>
<P>
It had to be against San Francisco, which finally gave the 1990 Rams something 
in common with the 1989 Rams. 
</P>
<P>
It had to come at Anaheim Stadium, where Joe Montana never loses, where Joe 
Montana's 49ers have turned the Rams into the 0-9ers. 
</P>
<P>
And it had to happen on a night when the Rams caught the 49ers down one Ronnie 
Lott and down the real Roger Craig -- and proceeded to usher their 
replacements, Dave Waymer and Dexter Carter, into the prime time, big time. 
</P>
<P>
As they had for Anthony Dilweg. 
</P>
<P>
And Jim Harbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
And Bubby Brister. 
</P>
<P>
And Emmitt Smith. 
</P>
<P>
And Gill Fenerty. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Rams, they all can be heroes . . . for one day. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the George Romero portion of this Ram season is over. The Rams are 
dead on their feet no more. Monday night's 26-10 defeat left the Rams at 5-9 
and officially eliminated from the NFL playoffs until 1991, when they may or 
may not be coached by John Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Unthinkable as it might have sounded before this season, Robinson might have 
coached his last home game at Anaheim Stadium. Rumors had the Rams playing for 
Robinson's job three weeks ago in San Francisco, where they retrieved a 
reprieve until last Sunday, when the Rams outpassed New Orleans, outrushed New 
Orleans, outdefensed New Orleans, but didn't outpoint New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson still has a year left on his contract, and Ram management has been 
known to gag while trying to eat $750,000 salaries, but if Robinson wanted out, 
who could possibly blame him? 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Slater, the veteran Ram offensive tackle who has seen it all, except a 
Ram Super Bowl victory, would like to see Robinson back. 
</P>
<P>
"This season has been like turning on a record," Slater said. "(But) every game 
we've played, we've been well-prepared. We were never outcoached, we were never 
fooled by another team. 
</P>
<P>
"We have one of the best football staffs in the league and one of the best head 
coaches in the league." 
</P>
<P>
So why have they had the most disappointing season in the league? 
</P>
<P>
Monday night didn't provide the answer. 
</P>
<P>
The Ram running game, as confused as it has ever been under Robinson, was 
thrust into hands of Gaston Green because whatever's been thrust into the hands 
of Cleveland Gary has usually wound up on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Green, however, didn't sit out the 1988 and 1989 seasons for no reason, and 
when Robinson went with the switch, he did it reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
"Gaston's a speed runner, the kind of guy who can hurt you if he gets into the 
secondary," Robinson said. "(But) when you run against the 49ers, you've got to 
try to nickel-and-dime them, plug away for four, five yards at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Green is a dollar-or-nothing kind of runner and Monday, he spent most of the 
evening with the pockets pulled out of his pants. In 12 carries, Green netted 
34 yards. His longest run covered eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
By the third quarter, Gary was back in, fumble fingers and all. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers also have a speed runner, a 5-foot-9, 170-pound oversight named 
Dexter Carter, who, like Green, had been a No. 1 draft choice and who, like 
Green, usually strikes his best poses on the sidelines. But with Craig slowed 
by a troublesome knee, San Francisco Coach George Seifert decided to go with 
little Dexter . . . and a little Dexter went a long way. 
</P>
<P>
Carter rushed 13 times and gained 124 yards. One time, he gained 74 yards. That 
one, good for a game-icing fourth-quarter touchdown, set the Ram season high 
for Longest Run Allowed By A Previous Unknown, eclipsing Fenerty's week-old 
mark by a good 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Simply punch in the names and punch the Rams out. An injury also claimed Ronnie 
Lott, the longtime Ram nemesis, so Seifert shifted Waymer over from strong 
safety and watched him create a Lott of havoc. 
</P>
<P>
Waymer made five tackles, intercepted a pass and generally made life miserable 
for Jim Everett. Everett, needing a quick strike if the Rams were going to have 
any kind of chance, completed one of seven passes in the first quarter and was 
one for 10 before he completed a second pass. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Everett would pass for a total of 232 yards, more than Montana, but 
as usual, Montana passed him on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
The play of the game, if not the Rams' season, came as the first-half ended. 
The 49ers led, 16-7, and were lining up for a what-the-heck 63-yard field goal 
attempt by Mike Cofer. Never mind that Cofer couldn't kick 63 yards with a good 
head monsoon; the Rams made no attempt to block it and then, when Pat Terrell 
caught the ball in the end zone, he made no attempt to run with it. 
</P>
<P>
No, Terrell elected to run to the exit, with the rest of the Rams falling over 
themselves to join them. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty minutes later, they exitted this season for good. And for the past 
month-and-a-half, isn't that all the Rams wanted?

THOMPSON: DEFENDING AGAINST RACIST CHARGES 'IDIOTIC' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Georgetown basketball Coach John Thompson said in an interview released Monday 
it would be "idiotic" for him to defend himself against accusations that he is 
anti-white, and added blacks sometimes question whether he is "black enough." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson also addressed in the Gentlemen's Quarterly interview his players' 
contact with drug kingpin Rayful Edmond and his own battle with illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
Race-related accusations against Thompson stem from the fact nearly all his 
players at Georgetown have been black. Blacks question Thompson because of his 
19-year association with a school that is nearly all white. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to get down on my knees and say 'I'm not a racist,' " Thompson 
said. " . . . That's the most idiotic and degrading thing I could do." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 49, said that when he was a teen-ager, people told him he was 
mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 14 years old, I still couldn't read," he said. "That was the most 
degrading, humiliating experience of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson has compiled a 429-143 record at Georgetown with a national title in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
The key to that championship was Patrick Ewing, whom Thompson protected from 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I caused that problem by putting myself in a situation where we were 
restrictive (in allowing media access)," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
On the meeting in which he told Edmond to stay away from his players, Thompson 
said, "Rayful didn't want any harm to come to any of my players. And I wanted 
to make sure no harm came to them -- including guilt by association." 
</P>
<P>
Edmond, sentenced in February to life without parole for his drug distribution 
activities, met socially with center Alonzo Mourning and at least one other 
Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
"Rayful understood me and I understood him because there is honor in guys like 
Rayful," Thompson said. "At least I know what his rules are. It's the guys in 
suits and ties that give me problems sometimes. I have a hell of a lot more 
trouble figuring out what rules they play by."

BEST START IN YEARS PROPELS UCLA TO FIFTH IN NATIONAL BASKETBALL POLL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Harrick promised stability when he became the sixth man to follow John 
Wooden as UCLA basketball coach. He is delivering success. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins (7-0) are off to their best start since Wooden quit winning national 
championships in 1975, and they are ranked fifth in this week's Associated 
Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, I think we were 45th," Harrick said Monday. "That's probably 
the best part of it -- where we were and where we've come to." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins haven't been ranked this high since the next-to-last poll of the 
1982-83 season. 
</P>
<P>
The top four teams -- Nevada Las Vegas, Arkansas, Syracuse and Arizona -- are 
unchanged from last week. Georgetown fell from No. 5 to No. 12 after losing to 
Texas El Paso, 71-60, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas (3-0), a 95-75 winner over Michigan State, got 61 of 63 first-place 
votes and 1,573 points. Syracuse, which beat Cal State Long Beach, 94-79, and 
UCLA, which beat DePaul, 92-90, got the other two first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the top 10 after UCLA are Indiana, Ohio State, North Carolina, 
Duke and LSU.

JACKSON'S SPECTACULAR RUNS DON'T DIMINISH ALLEN'S ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hardest play to make in football today, because of the way they defend 
against it, is the long run from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
You hardly see it at all anymore -- except when Raider running back Bo Jackson 
has the ball. 
</P>
<P>
As the Raiders made the playoffs, Jackson, merging speed and power, zipped 
through the Cincinnati defense for nearly 150 yards Sunday on one play alone. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Don Shula of the Miami Dolphins, impressed, never expects any back to get 
away for more than 25 or 30 yards these days. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got linebackers and defensive backs now that have sprinter speed," 
Shula said. "They utilize that speed to keep long plays from happening." 
</P>
<P>
Except Bo Jackson's plays. 
</P>
<P>
Most Bengals had at least two shots at him Sunday when he was racing about 15 
yards left, 45 right and 88 downfield. 
</P>
<P>
It was Jackson's third big play in as many weeks, after earlier touchdown runs 
of 62 and 55 yards. In his short Raider career, he also has sped for 91- and 
92-yard touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He seems to have taken football to a new level, although, as he frankly admits, 
he plays baseball and football for the fun of it. He isn't much of a 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Coach Art Shell wisely runs Marcus Allen most of the time, reducing the 
chance that Jackson will be hobbled by minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
One difference between Allen and Jackson is that Allen finds football fun even 
when nicked. 
</P>
<P>
The run-and-shoot offense made an unforgettable impression on the NFL Sunday 
with two upsets: the Houston Oilers over the Kansas City Chiefs, 27-10, and the 
Detroit Lions over the Chicago Bears, 38-21. 
</P>
<P>
There were two similarities: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Both losing teams obviously were loaded with better players than the 
winners. Most NFL people acknowledge that. The two losers are among the NFL's 
leaders in talent, offensive and defensive, except at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
They were simply ground up in the run-and-shoot machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The two winners, after struggling this season because of defensive -- not 
run-and-shoot -- deficiencies, both appeared to have improved defensively. In 
any case, their defenses both regained possession of the ball repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
That is essential for any offensive team. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense is coming around," said Houston quarterback Warren Moon, who 
completed 27 passes for 527 yards and three touchdowns. "Our (problem) this 
year is that we have brand-new systems on offense and defense both." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit quarterback Rodney Peete, who beat a sound Chicago team with four 
touchdown passes, said, "The defense kept getting us the ball back." 
</P>
<P>
Peete emerged as something of a Moon-type long passer, though not right away. 
After beginning the evening with two overthrows, he returned with a broad smile 
to the bench and told Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes, prophetically, "Let's keep 
doing it. I'll hit it." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions and Oilers are the only two run-and-shoot teams in a league in which 
Atlanta uses a lot of shotgun football, which is something else. And the NFL 
has learned the run-and-shoot belongs in pro football. 
</P>
<P>
You can compete with it in the NFL. You can win with it. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's many conservatives challenged that. 
</P>
<P>
Next question: Can you win the Super Bowl with it? 
</P>
<P>
Probably, but it's not likely this year. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's defensive coaches have spun a lot of wheels throughout the season 
looking for ways to slow down the run-and-shoot. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's games, for example, the losing Chicago and Kansas City coaching 
staffs both seemed to be concentrating too many of their resources against 
running backs Barry Sanders of Detroit and Lorenzo White of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
That enabled Peete and Moon to focus on the passes that led to both routs. 
</P>
<P>
And in clutch situations, Sanders and White ran well anyway. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Detroit and Houston are becoming increasingly successful on the 
ground as the season advances -- thus worrying the life out of opposing coaches 
-- is that run-and-shoot football builds confidence in running backs. 
</P>
<P>
Although they run only draw plays, Sanders and White, when called on, see so 
many holes in the defense that they want the ball on every down. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's Houston coach, Jerry Glanville, complained that White is only an 
east-west runner. This year, bolting north and south, he has been giving Moon 
more and more help. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting the balance everyone wants," Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
When Miami (11-3) plays at Buffalo (12-2) this week in the season's decisive 
AFC game, the Bills will have the cold-weather advantage, but the Dolphins will 
have Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
"He's having a big year," Shula said. "This is the old Dan Marino." 
</P>
<P>
And the old Marino is still the NFL's quickest, hardest-throwing pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
He's quicker than Joe Namath ever was, and he can throw the ball twice as hard 
as Joe Montana, and almost as accurately. 
</P>
<P>
But not always. In recent years, as the Dolphins lost their defense and running 
game, Marino became a minimum contributor. 
</P>
<P>
He was seldom sacked, true -- but that was because he declined to hold the ball 
long enough to take a hit. 
</P>
<P>
At the first sign of trouble, he unloaded. He either forced the ball somewhere 
or threw it away. And why not? Why stand in against a mayhem-minded blitzer 
when, even if you throw it for a touchdown, your defense is just going to give 
it back? 
</P>
<P>
So Marino saved himself, riding out the storm until Shula could rebuild the 
blocking line and defensive team. 
</P>
<P>
As Marino faces Buffalo, the NFL's new No. 1 defensive player, Bruce Smith, 
will represent one problem. A new Buffalo passer, Frank Reich, who has 
succeeded injured Jim Kelly, could be another. 
</P>
<P>
Winning three games in relief of Kelly last year, Reich, in some respects, 
seemed the better quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"Very few backups can come in and win for you," Buffalo General Manager Bill 
Polian said. "(Reich) is one of them." 
</P>
<P>
New York Giant quarterback Phil Simms didn't seem to be badly injured when he 
left Saturday's Buffalo game. 
</P>
<P>
But an hour or two later, when he went out to get in his car for the short 
drive home, he was on crutches, and, with a big plastic cast on his bad foot, 
trudged along slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Putting himself carefully behind the wheel, Simms rested the cast on the 
accelerator and said: "At least I have an excuse for speeding." 
</P>
<P>
There's never a good time to lose your quarterback, but for the Giants this is 
a better time than some. They should be able to win their last two against 
Phoenix and New England with backup Jeff Hostetler and get some momentum for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Against Buffalo, the Giants played a different kind of game when Hostetler came 
in, throwing the ball on first down and generally opening up. That suggested 
that part of Coach Bill Parcells' conservatism may be traced to a lack of 
confidence in Simms' aptitude for Joe Montana-type football. 
</P>
<P>
Simms, however, is a painstaking competitor. The Giants will miss him.

GORBACHEV CALLS FOR REFERENDUM ON SOVIET UNITY

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, battling to hold the Soviet Union together 
through an ever-deepening political and economic crisis, called Monday for a 
national referendum to decide whether the nation's constituent republics will 
join to form a new federal state or break away. 
</P>
<P>
Warning that the Soviet Union's very existence is now imperiled, Gorbachev 
said: "In going away from extreme centralization, we must not allow the union 
to be turned into something amorphous or to disintegrate. This would hit hard 
at the destinies of millions of people and at the whole world." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, acknowledging the growing chaos across the country, also asked the 
Congress of People's Deputies, the national Parliament, to approve a series of 
constitutional amendments restructuring the Soviet government and increasing 
his powers. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have strong government, tight discipline and control over the 
implementation of our decisions, then we shall be able to ensure normal food 
supplies, rein in crime and stop interethnic strife," Gorbachev said. "The most 
important thing now in overcoming the crisis is to enforce order in the 
country," he added. 
</P>
<P>
"If we fail, then deepening discord, a rampage of dark forces and the 
disintegration of the state become inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
To deal with the economic crisis, Gorbachev sketched a series of further 
reforms intended first to stabilize the fragmenting Soviet economy and then to 
shift it gradually from state ownership and central planning to free enterprise 
and market forces, but they appeared to delay more than accelerate the changes. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president described the present food shortages in Moscow, Leningrad 
and other major industrial centers as among the gravest of the country's 
problems. It results from "the unprecedented breakdown in mutual deliveries of 
goods between regions, the disruption of economic ties and the collapse of all 
normal relations between cities and the countryside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What is happening now is not simply insufficient output. It is a consequence 
of disorder, lack of control, criminal negligence and irresponsibility toward 
the people. . . . The indignation among the people is reaching the critical 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Assessing the overall state of the nation, Gorbachev has never been more stark, 
and he acknowledged that the increasing criticism of his leadership by many 
here has been correct. 
</P>
<P>
"The current situation in the country is grave," he said. "The crisis continues 
to deepen in the national economy, in political and social spheres and 
especially in interethnic relations. Stability and public order have been 
undermined. Each citizen, every family, workers and the entire country feel 
these effects. Society is greatly concerned about today and the future. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more the question is being asked whether the line toward perestroika 
has been chosen correctly. Are we following the right beacons and striking to 
achieve the right goals? Have we swerved off course? We are living through a 
truly critical moment. The great cause that we embraced five years ago and that 
has created conditions for a deep transformation of the country and the entire 
world is now under an obvious threat." 
</P>
<P>
Yet with this acknowledgement of the country's problems, the admission that his 
own errors had contributed to them and a call for "discipline, civil accord and 
selfless work," Gorbachev sought to rally the country out of what is perhaps 
its greatest crisis -- a crisis of confidence in his leadership, in 
perestroika, as his reforms are known, and in itself. 
</P>
<P>
"We should neither give up ourselves nor scare other people with talk of 
impending catastrophe," he said at the conclusion of his hourlong address to 
the congress. 
</P>
<P>
In an appeal to conservatives, first of all, Gorbachev promised to take the 
"most resolute actions without delay" as president to pull the country out of 
the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a question of reverting to the long-condemned and rejected methods 
of unlimited dictatorship and arbitrariness," he said. "What I mean is power 
acting on the basis of law and capable of ensuring stability and civil peace 
and thus overcoming the crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Even before Gorbachev spoke, a deputy from the Communist Party, which Gorbachev 
heads, called for a vote of no confidence in him and sought his replacement as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"Mikhail Sergeyevich (Gorbachev) has no moral right to lead the country any 
longer," declared Sazhi Umalatova, 37, a foreman at a machine tool factory and 
a member of the Supreme Soviet, the country's legislature. "You brought 
devastation, hunger, cold, blood and tears. Innocent people are perishing." 
</P>
<P>
Her resolution was excluded from the agenda of the session, 1,288 votes to 426, 
but the support it did gain demonstrated the discontent with Gorbachev among 
the deputies, who were elected in 1989 and have generally done his bidding. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev faced further criticism, even from his supporters, as deputies began 
to debate his proposals Monday afternoon. More than 430 deputies have asked to 
speak in the debate. The congress, scheduled to last 10 days, was convened to 
approve the draft "union treaty" and to amend the Soviet constitution to 
provide for a presidential system of government. 
</P>
<P>
Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan 
and a possible Gorbachev nominee for the new post of Soviet vice president, 
called for faster, more radical economic reforms rather than the government's 
planned stabilization program. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Blokhin, the leader of the conservative Soyuz group, castigated 
perestroika for bringing the country to the brink of collapse and leading to 
the likely breakup of the Soviet Union as it is now constituted. 
</P>
<P>
And Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov, a radical economist, objected to increasing 
Gorbachev's powers and proposed instead a political compact among the country's 
republics to tackle the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation, the largest 
republic, said that Gorbachev had brought no fresh thinking to the congress, 
and he dismissed the proposed referendum as "a waste of time" because the 
republics would have worked out a new set of relationships among themselves and 
with the center. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected to hear nothing new and my expectations came true," Yeltsin told 
journalists. "It looks like we are returning to the diktat of the center." 
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation has declared its willingness to sign the new treaty, but 
only if it provides for a greater decentralization of power than does the 
present draft. 
</P>
<P>
But the legislatures in the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania 
as well as in Moldova and Georgia have voted to reject the document, and 
nationalist leaders in Armenia and the Ukraine have expressed serious 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev described the result of the referendum in each republic as the "final 
verdict" on the issue, apparently to get around nationalists who control many 
of the republican legislatures, but he provided no details on how the 
referendum would work. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the new union treaty is concluded, determining the legal status of all 
its participants, the supreme legislative act to be enforced unconditionally 
remains the Soviet constitution," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
He pledged that he would use his enhanced powers as president to crack down 
hard on "the destructive activity of separatist and nationalist forces," 
acknowledging that his failure to move against them earlier resulted in "grave 
consequences in a number of cases" where ethnic tensions flared into riots and 
civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
He also said a "counteroffensive" would be launched against crime, particularly 
gangs responsible for economic crimes. "Tough measures are needed and we will 
resort to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative character of the speech was also clear from the promises 
Gorbachev made to the police and military to uphold their honor despite 
widespread criticism and to provide them with additional authority to maintain 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev was also hard on the country's intelligentsia. Most of them were 
among his most ardent supporters at the outset of perestroika but some are now 
among his most caustic critics. 
</P>
<P>
"The squandering of their energies by a significant number of intellectuals on 
bickering over the past and on infighting does a disservice, helping to stir 
destructive, destabilizing passions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Amid the escalating crisis, the talents and knowledge of some intellectuals 
have been directed not at pacifying peoples and looking for sensible approaches 
to worsened problems but at fanning the flames, including in interethnic 
relations where things have gone as far as open enmity, bloodshed and 
confrontation between republics."

NO ONE THROWS BOOK AT SMALL L.A. CRACK DEALERS; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG WARS: USUALLY, ONLY BIGGEST PEDDLERS AND WORST CHRONIC ABUSERS FACE 
LENGTHY PRISON TIME, RECORDS SHOW. 
</P>

<P>
California legislators in 1987 passed a law intended to stiffen the penalties 
for selling crack cocaine. Upon conviction, the new statute said, crack dealers 
had to go to prison, except in unusual cases. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, hundreds of crack dealers convicted in Superior Court each 
month do not go to prison, The Times has found. They are sent to County Jail 
for no more than a few months -- or weeks -- before returning to the streets, 
where they often commit new crimes. 
</P>
<P>
So goes the war on drugs in the nation's second most populous city. 
</P>
<P>
Violations of narcotics laws, particularly those involving cocaine, account for 
more Superior Court cases in Los Angeles County than all other felony filings 
combined. More than half of all criminal defendants in Superior Court today 
have been charged with dealing narcotics, possessing drugs for sale, or keeping 
them for personal use. 
</P>
<P>
Many have been convicted time and again for selling or using narcotics. Yet, 
only the biggest dealers and the most chronic abusers have the proverbial book 
thrown at them, records show. 
</P>
<P>
In studying more than 1,800 random Superior Court cases, The Times found that 
maximum sentences were given to only 3% of 184 defendants convicted of selling 
cocaine, heroin or other illegal drugs, excluding marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Of the other convicted dealers, 70% were granted probation on condition that 
they first serve time in the County Jail. In part because of jail overcrowding, 
none served more than five months. 
</P>
<P>
Those who sell marijuana received similar treatment, The Times found. Only one 
of 69 dealers charged with felony sale of marijuana received the maximum 
four-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"You wonder why people deal drugs? I'll tell you why," said Arvis Bruveris, a 
Los Angeles County deputy probation officer. "Because nothing happens to them 
when they get caught." 
</P>
<P>
Take Leonard Dean. Since moving to Los Angeles from Denver in 1985, he has been 
arrested or detained at least 24 times on suspicion of selling or possessing 
small quantities of cocaine, marijuana or fake drugs, or for possession of 
narcotics paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
He has been sent to the County Jail at least six times for drug law violations, 
serving an average of three months for each conviction, records show. He had 
never been to state prison -- until this year. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, it was not cocaine that sent him there. Dean's undoing was a 
bunch of "bunk," or bogus drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In April, an undercover officer approached Dean in the parking lot of a 
convenience store in Hollywood and asked to buy a "dove" -- a street term for 
$20 worth of rock cocaine. Dean handed him a small bindle. 
</P>
<P>
"This is good stuff," he told the officer, taking his money. The stuff, as it 
turned out, was an over-the-counter headache medicine. Narcotics detectives 
contend that dealing phony narcotics can be more dangerous than peddling the 
real thing because users have been known to kill dealers who cheated them. 
</P>
<P>
Dean was arrested and charged with sale "in lieu of" narcotics, which carries a 
possible prison sentence of 16 months, two years or three years. In July, he 
agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a 16-month term. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Corrections gives "one for one" time credit to 
virtually every prisoner. That means an inmate sentenced to 16 months serves 
about half that. In Dean's case, with credit for time served in jail, his 
sentence was closer to 4 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
As far as Dean was concerned, 4 1/2 months was too long. 
</P>
<P>
"I got screwed," Dean, 40, lamented in an interview at the California 
Institution for Men at Chino soon after he was sentenced. "I'm not a dope 
dealer. I'm a dope user. Every cop in Hollywood knows I don't deal dope. I deal 
bunk." 
</P>
<P>
Judges and prosecutors say they have no choice but to offer lesser sentences to 
most street dealers and other drug offenders so that court time and resources 
can be spent on criminals who pose greater threats to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the price we have to pay," said Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan. 
"We've got to move the lightweight stuff through the system so the heavy cases 
can be tried." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in law enforcement believes that the system should compromise with 
drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
While testifying before Congress in September, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl 
F. Gates suggested that casual drug users "ought to be taken out and shot." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the chief's hyperbole, The Times found that low-level crack dealers in 
Los Angeles routinely spend little time in custody -- even after selling 
cocaine to undercover officers. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that few are ever charged under the law passed in 1987 that was 
designed to put dealers in prison for selling crack cocaine, known in legal 
terms as cocaine "base." Widely regarded as more addictive than powdered 
cocaine, crack resembles small, white-colored rocks and is usually smoked in a 
pipe. 
</P>
<P>
Possessing powdered cocaine for sale is punishable in California by two, three 
or four years in prison. The 1987 statute increased the punishment for 
possession of crack for sale to three, four or five years. It also mandated 
that convicted crack dealers had to go to prison, except "where the interests 
of justice would best be served" by a grant of probation. 
</P>
<P>
However, before a prosecutor can charge a suspected dealer with having sold 
crack cocaine, he must first be able to prove in court that the drug is, in 
fact, crack. That requires special laboratory testing with a device called an 
infrared spectrofotometer. 
</P>
<P>
Testing normally takes between 20 and 30 minutes. Police criminalists mix a 
piece of suspected crack cocaine with chemicals, then place a glass slide of 
the mixture inside a spectrofotometer. An infrared beam scans the slide and 
determines whether the sample is crack by the way it absorbs light. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department's Scientific Investigations Division owns three $40,000 
spectrofotometers -- hardly enough, criminalists say, to process samples of all 
crack cocaine seized each day by the city's police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't have time to run the base test on every rock that comes in," 
said Donald Hale, a supervising criminalist. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the police and district attorney's office quietly struck a deal 
soon after the 1987 crack law was passed: Unless the case involves more than 2 
grams of cocaine, police criminalists will not conduct lab tests to confirm 
whether the cocaine is truly crack unless specifically requested by 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office, with plenty of bigger cases, rarely makes the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
So, dozens of small-time street dealers arrested each week in Los Angeles are 
charged with selling powdered cocaine, rather than crack. Instead of a minimum 
three years in state prison, they are subject to no more than a year in County 
Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The lab's restrictive testing policies benefit the vast majority of drug 
dealers arrested in Los Angeles today, narcotics detectives say, because 
street-level dealers usually carry no more than a gram or two of crack -- which 
still can amount to a dozen or more rocks of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
When questioned by The Times, Gates indicated that he was unaware of the 
arrangement between his lab and the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"The Legislature has come out with a very tough law and we're not following 
through on it," Gates said. "I'd be very happy to make sure that the lab 
processes whatever the amount of (crack) if the district attorney will file 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner pointed out that his prosecutors have filed more than 
1,800 cases of sale of crack this year, the majority arising from arrests made 
by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner noted that the Sheriff's Department, unlike the police, performs 
necessary laboratory tests in all crack cases, even when the amount seized is 
less than 2 grams. 
</P>
<P>
He said the district attorney's office would be willing to file all crack cases 
generated by the Police Department as long as laboratory analysis is done in 
each case. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no more work for us to file," Reiner said, "and it gives us more 
leverage" against dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Small quantities of crack are not the only evidence for which the Los Angeles 
Police lab has little time today. 
</P>
<P>
Criminalists also no longer analyze drug paraphernalia for traces of narcotics, 
according to staff members. Consequently, a user or dealer caught with an empty 
pipe probably would not face criminal charges -- even though possessing drug 
paraphernalia is a misdemeanor, punishable by six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to do every narcotics booking," said Hale, who has worked in the lab 
for 24 years. "But it's gotten to where that's just impossible. . . . It's all 
these filings." 
</P>
<P>
Of 544 cocaine cases of all types examined by The Times, two-thirds involved 
dealers or users caught with a gram or less. Among them was Fernando Molina 
Rodriguez, a transient from Mexico who last year was sentenced to six months in 
jail for robbing and knifing a man near MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested in April in the same area after selling suspected crack to an 
undercover Los Angeles police officer. The amount, records show, was less than 
2 grams -- not enough for Police Department laboratory testing -- so he was 
charged with selling powdered cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
In Georgia, a judge recently sentenced a man to life in prison for selling an 
undercover police officer $20 worth of cocaine -- the same amount that 
Rodriguez sold. In Indiana, judges are authorized to mete out 20 to 50 years 
for a mere 3 grams. 
</P>
<P>
In May, after Rodriguez agreed to plead guilty to selling cocaine, Los Angeles 
County Superior Court Judge Clarence (Red) Stromwall sentenced him to three 
years' probation, with the first year to be spent in jail. 
</P>
<P>
With 65 days of credit for time already served, Rodriguez was released a little 
more than four months later. 
</P>
<P>
In central Los Angeles alone, about 100 people each week arrested on suspicion 
of selling crack or possessing it for sale are charged instead with dealing or 
possessing powdered cocaine because the amounts do not warrant lab testing, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. John A. Perlstein. 
</P>
<P>
Even when suspects are charged with selling small amounts of crack, the charges 
often are dropped during plea bargaining and defendants are given probation -- 
sometimes with serious consequences, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Rivera Perez, 21, sold an undercover police officer 12 cocaine rocks -- 
2.89 grams -- in April, 1989, and was charged with selling crack. 
</P>
<P>
During plea bargaining, prosecutors tossed out the crack charge and Perez 
pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of selling powdered cocaine, court records 
show. He was placed on three years' probation by Superior Court Judge Sam 
Burbick and ordered to serve the first six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Perez was released after about three months and promptly deserted probation. 
</P>
<P>
Early one morning in December, 1989, while allegedly fleeing a drug deal gone 
sour, Perez forced his way into an apartment in Mid-Wilshire and held a tenant 
at knifepoint for 2 1/2 hours, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
As dawn approached, a neighbor knocked on the door. Perez, according to police 
reports, chased him with the knife and shoved him out of a second-story window. 
The neighbor suffered a broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Perez was detained by the building's security guard until officers arrived. He 
was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and violating his probation. 
</P>
<P>
In May, as the case was about to go to trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Marsh M. 
Goldstein dismissed the assault charges, records show. Perez's former hostage 
could not be located to testify, and the neighbor whose ankle was fractured was 
in prison on a narcotics charge, according to Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
"The case," he said, "was going down the drain." 
</P>
<P>
With the assault charges dropped, Goldstein pressed the probation violation. 
Perez in June admitted he was in violation and was sentenced to three years in 
prison -- the lowest term for selling cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
With credit for time that he already had served in jail, he will likely remain 
imprisoned for less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Why wasn't Perez sent to prison in 1989, instead of being granted probation? 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with volume today," said Goldstein, a prosecutor for 25 years. 
"The way the system is, it almost ensures that guilty people are going to slip 
through the cracks or get sentenced to less." 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, prosecutors under John Perlstein's supervision each week 
reviewed about 100 narcotics cases of every type. By last year, the weekly 
average had grown to 400. Today, it is approaching 500. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the reality of life in Los Angeles," Perlstein said, staring out his 
office window at the downtown skyline. 
</P>
<P>
With so many cases, the process of filing charges against drug offenders begins 
before the sun rises. 
</P>
<P>
At 4:30 a.m. each weekday, narcotics detectives at the Police Department's 
Parker Center headquarters begin compiling paper work on drug offenders 
arrested the previous day. Five copies of each document are then stuffed into 
large, gold-colored envelopes called "packages" and carried to the district 
attorney's offices on the 17th floor of the Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
By 7 a.m., the envelopes are stacked on a table next to Perlstein's desk. Three 
detectives working in assembly-line fashion jot cryptic notations on each 
envelope, collate additional documents and pass each package to Perlstein. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor examines the cases, rejecting about 1 in 4, referring about 1 in 
10 to the city attorney as misdemeanors, and assigning the rest to the 
half-dozen deputy district attorneys who will draw up felony criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, secretaries will type up formal "charge sheets," so that the 
suspected drug offenders can be arraigned -- or formally accused -- before a 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
Filing procedures, authorities say, are faster today than ever. By law, police 
and prosecutors in California once had three days to formally charge a suspect 
or free him. But under a 1989 court decision, a suspect can be held only two 
days without being charged. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities, as if to pick up the slack, have taken a more aggressive 
role in prosecuting local drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad fact . . . is that state drug sentences are notoriously weak (in 
California)," former drug czar William J. Bennett was quoted as saying last 
month. "This means that (the federal agencies) must shoulder a disproportionate 
share of the burden of apprehending drug criminals in California." 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, according to agents, the U.S. attorney routinely referred 
federal narcotics investigations to the district attorney's office for 
prosecution if defendants were arrested with less than with 1,000 grams (2.2 
pounds) of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Today, federal charges, which can be much harsher than state laws, are filed in 
cocaine cases where a minimum of 500 grams is involved, said Special Agent John 
Marcello of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. He noted that the U.S. attorney 
nowadays will take on cases in which less cocaine has been seized but where 
there are "aggravated circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
In December, a 22-year-old south Los Angeles man arrested with about 150 grams 
of cocaine became the first person in California to be sentenced to life in 
prison without possibility of parole under a new federal law designed to put 
away offenders upon their third drug conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Although Superior Court judges in Los Angeles County tend to give comparatively 
light sentences to street dealers, they show no reluctance to impose heavy 
sentences when defendants are linked to sizable amounts of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge William Pounders, in July, sentenced a man with no 
criminal history to 14 years in prison after officers watched him unload from a 
van 300 kilogram-size packages of cocaine -- about 660 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
There are special statutes on California's books that allow judges to impose 
mandatory prison terms when much smaller amounts of drugs are involved, 
particularly when defendants have a previous drug conviction. In Los Angeles, 
prosecutors often overlook those special statutes when filing charges or drop 
them during plea bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of drug user Benjamin Jimenez, 36, and drug dealer Effrain 
Velasquez, 20, both illegal immigrants from El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
In March, officers arrested the two men after watching Velasquez sell Jimenez 
$20 worth of suspected crack cocaine outside a bar on Alvarado Street, west of 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Officers recovered 15 pieces of suspected crack from Velasquez. However, the 
Police Department's lab did not not analyze the contraband and Velasquez was 
charged with selling powdered cocaine rather than crack. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez, who apparently had a clean record, was granted probation and given a 
six-month jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that Jimenez last year was twice convicted on felony drug charges 
and twice granted probation. He deserted probation both times. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time that he received a clear and unambiguous signal that California's 
drug laws were meant to be obeyed by all who choose to live in this country," 
Deputy Probation Officer Ray Chavira wrote in a report to the court after 
Jimenez's most recent arrest. 
</P>
<P>
With his previous convictions, Jimenez was potentially ineligible for 
probation. However, prosecutors did not file a special charge that would have 
compelled a judge to send Jimenez to prison, records show. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Jimenez pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine and Superior Court 
Judge Candace D. Cooper ordered that he spend a year in jail, followed by two 
years on probation. 
</P>
<P>
"I plead guilty," Jimenez told the probation officer beforehand, "because I 
like the plea-bargain arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
The judge ordered that Jimenez report to the Probation Department within three 
days after serving his jail time. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me advise you . . . Mr. Jimenez," Cooper is quoted as saying in court 
transcripts, "(that) if you fail to report to probation in this case, if you 
desert this probation, I will send you to state prison." 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez was released from jail Sept. 26, less than four months later. 
</P>
<P>
He has yet to report to the Probation Department.

U.S. SEEKS BANK LEVY TO AID FDIC; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: INDUSTRY WILL BE ASKED FOR $25 BILLION TO SHORE UP INSURANCE SYSTEM. 
FIRMS IN RETURN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ENTER OTHER BUSINESSES, SEIDMAN SAYS.

<P>
The Bush Administration and federal regulators will ask the banking industry -- 
rather than U.S. taxpayers -- for an extra $25 billion to replenish the rapidly 
dwindling insurance fund that protects depositors in case of bank failures, a 
top federal regulator said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators are discussing with bankers the details of a major financial 
contribution by the industry, an amount equal to approximately 1% of all 
deposits, L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 
told a congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time levy would represent a vast increase in payments by banks, which 
already are scheduled to pay insurance premiums of approximately $6 billion a 
year over the next three years. The special levy would substantially exceed the 
current yearly profits of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
But Seidman said the levy is essential to save the fund, adding: "The resort to 
the taxpayer is the last resort. It ought not to be done while the industry can 
handle the problem." 
</P>
<P>
In return for providing badly needed cash for the insurance fund, banks should 
be granted broad new powers to move into other lines of business, and the 
traditional state barriers limiting bank expansion should be abolished, Seidman 
told the financial institutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee. 
The expansion of bank powers will be the centerpiece of the Bush 
Administration's financial reform program next year. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman called on Congress to take action early next year on the reform 
package, including the special levy to bolster the fund that protects deposits 
up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers say they are willing to pour additional money into the insurance fund 
as part of a legislative package enabling them to enter the insurance and 
securities businesses without restraints. 
</P>
<P>
"We have always paid whatever was necessary to keep the fund on a sound 
footing, and we have the willingness to continue doing so," said Mark Burneko, 
a spokesman for the American Bankers Assn. "The bottom line is the need to get 
the fund up as quickly as possible without imposing an overwhelming financial 
hardship on the industry." 
</P>
<P>
The insurance fund, which held $18.3 billion just four years ago, will finish 
this year at $9 billion and plunge to $4 billion by the close of 1991, Seidman 
said. The fund has declined as more than 800 banks have failed since 1986. 
Approximately 180 more are expected to fail next year. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, banks pay 19.5 cents into the insurance fund for every $100 worth of 
deposits. Those premiums, interests on investments and the special 1% levy on 
all deposits could generate $52 billion over the next three years to pay for 
losses involved in shutting down insolvent banks and paying off insured 
deposits. Almost half the money, about $25 billion, would be generated by the 
one-time 1% levy on deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Outlays by the insurance fund depend on the size of losses at individual banks, 
with the insurance money filling in the gap between the bank's deposits and the 
weakened value of its real estate loans and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
A $52-billion cushion could enable the fund to handle bank failures involving 
total assets of $270 billion to $320 billion, Seidman noted. With that cushion, 
the FDIC "fund should be able to handle the problems of the next three years 
unless a disaster occurs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A special assessment of $25 billion would represent about two years' worth of 
bank industry profits, according to a projection by R. Dan Brumbaugh Jr., an 
economist who testified before the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"The ability of the banks to take that additional money out of earnings depends 
on what happens in the economy," said Burneko of the ABA. "There is still 
considerable uncertainty. The scenarios on losses are quite widespread." 
</P>
<P>
One possible way to ease the financial burden on banks would be to permit them 
to spread the contribution over several years, according to government and 
industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
The banks' additional contribution would be included in the Bush 
Administration's plan for the most sweeping overhaul of the financial system 
since the Great Depression. The proposal will be offered to Congress early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
If banks are allowed to enter nontraditional businesses as part of this 
overhaul, Seidman and other regulators want so-called "fire walls" built 
between divisions so insured deposits are not placed into risky ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators and bankers alike are quick to assert that the problems of banks are 
manageable. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's 12,400 banks had profits of $15.4 billion for the first three 
quarters of the year -- a 13% improvement over the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), the subcommittee chairman, said: "We need to make 
certain that the taxpayers of this nation, who already have been forced to pay 
too much for the savings and loan bailout, are not asked to bail out the banks 
or the bank insurance fund." 
</P>
<P>
Several panel members suggested that regulators should stop banks from paying 
dividends to stockholders until the crisis passes. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials and members of Congress believe the banking industry, 
although threatened by falling real estate values that have turned many loans 
sour, can avoid the crisis that gripped the savings and loan business. 
Financial and regulatory standards have been more strict for banks, and federal 
oversight has been more intense. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of hundreds of S&amp;Ls bankrupted the insurance fund protecting 
their deposits. It will cost taxpayers as much as $130 billion, without 
counting future interest on bonds, to finance the S&amp;L cleanup by closing 
crippled institutions and paying off insured depositors. 
</P>
<P>
But if Seidman is correct, and the economic situation doesn't worsen, the extra 
assessment on banks should keep the insurance fund for banks solvent. 
</P>
<P>
The costs of bank failures over the next three years could range from $17 
billion to $63 billion, depending on the severity and duration of the 
recession, according to a report presented to the subcommittee Monday by 
Brumbaugh and two other economists, Robert Litan and James R. Barth. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasting can "only be educated guesses," said Seidman, offering a skeptical 
view of the report. "Three years ago, who would have predicted that Germany 
would be reunited and that we would be shipping food to Russia? In three years, 
will we be in a booming economy, stagflation or a deep recession?" 
</P>
<P>
His own educated guess is that a $25-billion infusion would keep the "weak" 
insurance fund working.

POPULIST PRIEST WINS IN HAITI, IS BACKED BY U.S. 
</P>

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unofficial returns Monday swept the populist priest Father Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide to a landslide victory in Haiti's presidential election, bringing an 
immediate pledge of support from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We congratulated him on his victory and told him the U.S. fully supports the 
democratic process in Haiti," said Assistant Secretary of State Bernard 
Aronson, representing President Bush's official observer delegation to the 
remarkably peaceful Sunday election. 
</P>
<P>
Aristide's radical posture and anti-American rhetoric had initially worried 
U.S. officials. Before becoming a candidate, the charismatic priest continually 
called on his nation's poor to take matters into their own hands rather than 
trust to elections. After joining the race for president, he took steps to 
moderate his platform and tone down his sermons, but questions remained Monday 
as to the direction his government would take. 
</P>
<P>
"We fully respect him as the apparent president-elect of Haiti and look forward 
to working closely with his government," Aronson said. He indicated that U.S. 
financial aid to Haiti will resume as soon as the new Aristide government, to 
be inaugurated Feb. 7, makes clear "its plans and policies and its needs." 
</P>
<P>
Former World Bank President Robert S. McNamara, a member of another observer 
delegation led by former President Jimmy Carter, said he is "certain" that the 
bank and other international financial institutions also will offer assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Aristide had campaigned against foreign aid as a panacea for Haiti's massive 
economic and social problems. 
</P>
<P>
The streets of the capital were engulfed for much of the day by torrents of 
impoverished but joyous supporters of the 37-year-old slum priest, tens of 
thousands of them dancing, singing and waving tree branches symbolic of 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
One act of violence marred the citywide celebration when a member of a police 
patrol fired into a crowd of chanting demonstrators, killing a pregnant woman, 
then drove a pickup truck across her body, according to eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The killing took place directly in front of St. John Bosco Church, where 
Aristide used to preach before he was expelled from the Salesian order two 
years ago after upsetting the Catholic hierarchy with his tirades against 
authority and outside influences -- including the U.S. Embassy here. 
</P>
<P>
One of several failed attempts to assassinate Aristide took place in the church 
in September, 1988, when 13 of his parishioners were hacked and clubbed to 
death by a still-unpunished band of thugs operating under Haitian army 
protection. Witnesses identified the attackers as former strong-arm men of the 
Tontons Macoutes, the ruthless private militia that kept the Duvalier family 
dictatorship in power for 29 years. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from the one incident, police and army troops maintained polite 
security, and there were no signs of the Macoute thugs. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at Aristide's political headquarters said the priest would have no 
comment on his victory until it is officially confirmed by Haiti's Electoral 
Council, the constitutional body that organized and conducted the long-delayed 
first democratic election in Haiti's 186-year history. The council said it 
would be releasing results piecemeal over the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
But as Aronson's early congratulations suggested, there was no doubt concerning 
the final result. A senior member of the 202-person observer team from the 
Organization of American States said data collected by OAS and U.N. experts 
gave Aristide 60% to 70% of the total vote. His nearest competitor in the 
11-man race was Marc Bazin, 58, a former World Bank official, who polled less 
than 20%, the OAS source said. 
</P>
<P>
The single partial result released Monday night by the Electoral Council showed 
Aristide with 70.6% to Bazin's 12.6% of a small cluster of precincts totaling 
27,227 votes. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated 1,000 international observers from Carter's group, the OAS, the 
United Nations and other organizations appeared to be unanimous in certifying 
the elections as free, fair and credible. Carter said there were 
irregularities, mainly delays in distributing ballots and other election 
materials, in only 4% of the more than 14,000 polling places around the 
country. He said that was insignificant "even in nations that have been 
conducting democratic elections for generations." 
</P>
<P>
Aristide's stunning victory left Haiti's traditional social and financial power 
structure, as well as foreign governments that had long urged democratic 
elections here, feeling vaguely uneasy concerning the direction his government 
will take. 
</P>
<P>
The wispy, bespectacled priest has been an emotional and often mystical 
champion of Haiti's downtrodden poor, often urging them to take justice into 
their own hands to eradicate Tontons Macoutes and others with links to the 
oppressive Duvalier dynasty. For months he opposed democratic elections as a 
trick of the conservative Establishment designed to further oppress the poor, 
who flocked to him as to a new messiah. 
</P>
<P>
But after entering the presidential race, Aristide moderated what seemed to be 
class-war elements in his version of liberation theology and his vaguely 
socialist, anti-American rhetoric. Instead, he offered an imprecise program of 
"justice, participation and transparency." 
</P>
<P>
Conservative critics fear that his mass of poor followers, if not Aristide 
himself, may have in mind the same kind of street justice that during the past 
five years has repeatedly seen mobs kill suspected Duvalierists and storm their 
houses and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
They also fear that Aristide's idea of mass participation in government may be 
to appeal to the mob rather than work through the constitutionally elected 
legislature after he takes power. Legislative opposition appears inevitable 
because Aristide's party fielded only a few candidates for the Senate and 
National Assembly in Sunday's election, virtually guaranteeing that the 
majority of both houses will represent the parties of his election opponents.

S.F. ADOPTS SAFETY RULES FOR USE OF VDTS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE SUPERVISORS' ACTION MAKES IT THE FIRST MAJOR CITY TO ADOPT SUCH 
REGULATIONS. THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WILL ASK THE MAYOR TO VETO IT.

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an action watched closely by businesses and worker-safety proponents 
nationwide, San Francisco on Monday became the nation's first city to set 
safety rules for the use of video display terminals in the workplace when the 
Board of Supervisors approved a controversial ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, which has hotly opposed the measure as 
unreasonable and costly despite compromises aimed at appeasing businesses, 
immediately said it would urge Mayor Art Agnos to veto it. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the bill by a 7-4 vote puts San Francisco in the forefront of 
dealing with an issue that many observers have said represents a serious 
downside of technology. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, thousands of workers have begun suffering from vision problems 
and debilitating hand, wrist, arm and other injuries associated with frequent 
VDT use. Other concerns have been raised that radiation emissions from the 
ubiquitous machines might cause miscarriages and birth defects, although such 
cases have not been as thoroughly documented. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by outgoing Supervisor Nancy Walker, the legislation has engendered 
intense debate and drawn the interest of government agencies, employers, 
politicians and worker-safety advocates nationwide. Although dozens of previous 
efforts to mandate such safety measures have failed, the bill's supporters hope 
this legislation can serve as a model for other cities and counties in 
California and other states. 
</P>
<P>
"The workers of this town do have a victory," Walker said after a tense 
hourlong debate. She added, however, that earlier compromises have made it "a 
very weak ordinance" compared to what she had envisioned when she introduced 
the legislation in August. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which a week earlier had been approved 8 to 1 on a preliminary 
reading, would give companies with 15 or more employees two years to provide 
VDT users with adjustable furniture, anti-glare screens, proper lighting, 
training and 15-minute breaks every two hours. Failure to comply would make 
employers subject to a $500-a-day fine. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also establishes a seven-member advisory panel that would begin in 
April to study VDT safety issues and recommend ways of preventing ailments 
associated with the machines. 
</P>
<P>
Among revisions worked out in recent weeks by labor and business was the 
elimination of a requirement that VDT stations be at least five feet apart to 
minimize any potential exposure to radiation. Employers had successfully argued 
that such a rule would have forced them to rent far more office space, making 
the change too costly. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, estimates of the cost of compliance vary widely, with businesses 
saying they would be forced to spend as much as $3,000 per VDT workstation and 
unions saying that the cost could be as little as $350. 
</P>
<P>
Despite previous compromises, last-minute lobbying by Supervisor Doris Ward on 
Monday threatened to undermine the bill. She proposed an amendment that would 
have eliminated furniture requirements and instead would have simply mandated 
that the VDT task force make recommendations within two years. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of Walker, she changed her mind and voted against the amendment 
when it was reintroduced by Bill Maher, a supervisor opposed to the 
legislation. Walker, who said she has invested 4 1/2 years in the effort to 
regulate VDT use, agreed later that Ward had done her a favor. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, however, said she fully expects that amendments will be proposed as the 
measure is more closely analyzed. In particular, she foresees that employers 
might win a hardship clause that would entitle some businesses to seek 
exemptions because of the expense of buying new furniture. 
</P>
<P>
James L. Lazarus, vice president of the San Francisco chamber, said the 
amendment would have been preferable to "requiring every employer to convert 
existing equipment." In opposing the legislation, many of the city's big 
employers have said they should be allowed to continue to take voluntary steps 
to upgrade workstations. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Kellogg, an organizer with Local 790 of the Service Employees 
International Union in San Francisco, said the debate came down to this: "We're 
fighting for workplace safety; they're fighting against government 
intervention. It's a shame . . . with people getting injured on the job." 
</P>
<P>
The matter poses a sticky question for Agnos, who leads a city widely regarded 
as being pro-labor and anti-business. Small businesses, in particular, have 
argued that the VDT legislation would force some employers to relocate outside 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Shafer, Agnos' press secretary, said the mayor has not yet made up his 
mind and plans to talk with labor and business leaders. The mayor, who is 
expected to receive the legislation on Wednesday, is required to act within 10 
business days. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to sign VDT legislation that both labor and business can hold as a 
model," Agnos said. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, a similar law in Suffolk County, N.Y., was struck down by a 
judge; that case is being appealed.

ANDERSON'S REMOVAL LAID TO LACK OF FIRM FIST; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSE: IN A SIGN OF TODAY'S POWER POLITICS, THE VETERAN CONGRESSMAN WAS REMOVED 
AS CHAIRMAN OF THE PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE. HE SAYS HE DIDN'T CHOOSE TO 'PLAY 
THE GAME.'

<P>
After parlaying two decades of dogged political toil into one of the U.S. House 
of Representatives' most coveted positions in 1988, veteran Congressman Glenn 
M. Anderson of Harbor City was unceremoniously stripped of the prize this month 
in a rare vote of rejection by his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's undoing? As chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation 
Committee, he failed to wield power with the firm fist of his predecessors, 
opponents in his own Democratic Party said. He lost precious turf to other 
House committees and to the Senate. He failed to get things done during a 
period when voters are angry with Congress' inability to solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The word was getting around . . . that he couldn't do the job," said Rep. 
Norman Mineta (D-San Jose), who led the campaign to unseat Anderson from the 
chairmanship of the committee on Dec. 5. Others said Anderson's abilities had 
so slipped in recent years that virtually all his comments had to be written 
out for him. 
</P>
<P>
Since his first Congressional election in 1968, Anderson, once California's 
lieutenant governor, had become renowned for his ability to land coveted 
federal projects for his South Bay-Long Beach constituents. The voters rewarded 
him with routine reelection to his 32nd Congressional District seat, including 
sending him back for a 12th two-year term on Nov. 5 with 65% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
But neither district loyalty nor his congressional seniority could save the 
Public Works post that Anderson won just 33 months ago. At age 77, Anderson 
became one of only three members to be stripped of their chairmanships in the 
last 15 years, losing by a vote of 150 to 100 in the House Democratic Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
As Anderson tells it, his failing was being overly generous with the power that 
traditionally was concentrated in the chairmanship of the 50-member committee, 
the chief dispenser of pork-barrel federal projects. He said his decision to 
share power with his five subcommittee chairmen fostered a false perception of 
weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Anderson says his defeat may actually benefit his home district and 
California. As chairman, he said, "whenever I went to bat for California on any 
public works issue, some of my colleagues accused me of not having a national 
infrastructure perspective . . . I certainly cannot be accused of this 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson may have been a genius over the years in winning local projects, but 
when it came to more complex issues and to the care and feeding of 49 political 
egos on his committee, he seemed out of his element. Interviews with those who 
know both Congress and Anderson paint a complex picture that offers lessons not 
just about Anderson, but also about the political system and the delicate power 
politics of Congress: 
</P>
<P>
* Twenty years ago, the seniority system was so sacrosanct that Anderson 
probably could not have been budged from his chairmanship. Congress is 
protective of its own. The more powerful the member, the more protective others 
tend to be. Alcoholism, mental lapses and other questionable behavior were 
tolerated or overlooked. That is no longer so. 
</P>
<P>
* The inability of a chairman to do the job can be overcome by a top-notch 
staff. But Washington sources were unanimous in saying Anderson's staff was 
unresponsive, overly protective of Anderson, too deferential to committee 
Republicans and generally not up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
* Newer members of Congress have become restive with older chairmen who cling 
to their posts by virtue of seniority and little else. One other chairman was 
dumped and several others faced unexpected challenges this year. On the other 
hand, seniority still ruled in the selection of their successors. 
</P>
<P>
"It showed we want a meritocracy, not just a gerontocracy," said Rep. David 
Skaggs, (D-Colo.), a public works committee member. "But that when there's a 
contest among capable people, seniority does play a role." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio, (D-Ore.), a committee member who helped unseat 
Anderson and who will begin his third term at 43: "There's a real concern about 
the public perception of Congress and the effectiveness of Congress. We want 
people to represent us who seem to be dynamic, to be getting things done 
nationally." 
</P>
<P>
Stories circulated in the Capitol that Anderson couldn't be counted on to 
remember crucial information. 
</P>
<P>
"The chairman was simply unable to operate without a script," said one 
Democratic committee member. "In committee and particularly on the floor, this 
conveys to colleagues that you're at their mercy." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Lee Anderson told The Times that her husband always has needed 
his memory jogged to some degree. "I've always had to stand beside him and 
whisper him things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not 25 years old (and) he's not 35 years old. . . . You always have a 
slowdown in memory, but that doesn't affect his judgment. " 
</P>
<P>
One supporter, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), said he went to Anderson time 
and again to get help for projects in his district and found him capable of 
delivering on his promises. 
</P>
<P>
"In my experience, on the issues I worked with Glenn on, he was quite 
effective, focused and able to accomplish what he set out to accomplish," 
Levine said. "I have seen him come through time and again on issues of 
significance to California." 
</P>
<P>
It is no coincidence that the deepened Los Angeles ship channel is named for 
Anderson. So is the Century Freeway, officially called the Glenn M. Anderson 
Freeway. The new federal building in Long Beach is expected to carry his name 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only two ship channels that I know of that were ever named after a 
member of Congress: One is the Sam Houston Channel in Texas and the other is 
the Anderson Channel in Los Angeles. You can't knock that," Anderson said in 
answer to his critics. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Anderson managed to succeed in politics, beginning back in 1940 as 
mayor of Hawthorne, despite his soft-spoken, unaggressive and -- many say -- 
indecisive style. The best-remembered event of Anderson's early career came in 
1965 when as lieutenant governor to Edmund G. (Pat) Brown he hesitated in 
calling out the National Guard during the early stages of the Watts riots. The 
next year, Anderson was defeated in a try for a third term, but was elected to 
Congress two years later. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, however, found himself in deep water when running one of the premier 
committees of the U.S. Congress. In addition to the complaints that Anderson 
from time to time would forget a member's name or give his staff too much 
authority, there was grumbling that he allowed his wife too much influence over 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Said one Republican member: "With Anderson, the committee has been adrift for 
two years." 
</P>
<P>
Turf is power in Congress. And committee members' biggest single complaint was 
that Anderson did not guard the public works committee's turf. 
</P>
<P>
They contend that Anderson constantly lost ground to the appropriations 
subcommittees that actually hand out the money for projects authorized by 
public works. More turf was lost to the Senate when competing versions of House 
and Senate bills dealing with committee subjects were reconciled in conference 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
Within public works, Democrats complained that Anderson and his staff were too 
accommodating to minority Republicans. As an example, one House aide said it 
was traditional that a painting of the chairman hang in the committee's hearing 
room. Members were astounded one day to find a picture of Rep. John P. 
Hammerschmidt of Arkansas, the ranking Republican member, on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"They never heard of such a situation," the staff member said, and committee 
members were irate that Anderson had allowed it. 
</P>
<P>
Another day, while the committee was conducting a session to put an important 
piece of legislation in final form, Democratic members were unable to get 
copies of the chairman's proposed bill that were given to Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the young members were furious and demanded a caucus of the committee 
Democrats, only to be told that the committee did not hold party caucuses. A 
shouting match ensued. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 3, public works Democrats met privately and 26 of the 28 voted to seek 
Anderson's ouster. Ironically, one of those who supported Anderson was Rep. 
Robert A. Roe, (D-N.J.), the chairman of the Science, Space and Technology 
Committee who was elected to replace him. Roe, who was second in seniority to 
Anderson at public works, thought "the challenge was premature," an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee caucus presented Anderson with its decision Dec. 4 during a 
meeting in the Speaker's dining room. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem to bother him," one Democratic member said. "He looked the same 
when he left the room as when he came in." 
</P>
<P>
Although his statement revealed bruised feelings, Anderson said he was not 
bitter: 
</P>
<P>
"I must say that, I did feel a bit let down by those in whom I put so much 
trust. I chose not to play the game. I never have in my career and I don't 
intend to start now."

SALCIDO GETS DEATH SENTENCE IN 7 MURDERS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: HIS FATHER-IN-LAW CALLS HIM A COWARD IN THE SLAYINGS OF 6 FAMILY MEMBERS 
AND A CO-WORKER IN A 1989 WINE-COUNTRY RAMPAGE.

<P>
A former winery worker was sentenced to death Monday for killing his wife, two 
daughters, mother-in-law, his wife's two young sisters and a co-worker in a 
wine-country rampage. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Salcido's father-in-law, Robert Richards, called him a coward and 
tearfully asked for swift justice. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido, 29, was convicted on Oct. 30 of the April, 1989, murders. 
</P>
<P>
Richards, taking advantage of a California law that permits victims or their 
relatives to address the judge before sentencing, urged Sierra County Superior 
Court Judge Reginald Littrell to follow the jury's recommendation for the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"Why drag this thing out for years?" Richards said. "He admitted he did it. 
He's showed no remorse." 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican-born Salcido, speaking through an interpreter, did express remorse 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to express that I repent for the things that have happened to the 
family that I loved the most, and for all the grief and pain I have caused," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said Salcido will be transferred to San Quentin prison within 10 
days. Since he was sentenced to death, California law requires that his case be 
automatically appealed to the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
California has not executed anyone since 1967. About 280 prisoners are on Death 
Row. 
</P>
<P>
Salcido's attorney, Public Defender Marteen Miller, asked that sentencing be 
delayed until Jan. 17 to allow time for Mexican officials to prepare a request 
that Salcido's life be spared under a no-death clause in Mexico's extradition 
treaty with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The judge delayed sentencing for an hour Monday before rejecting the motion 
because Miller had not received the request. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the spree were Salcido's wife, Angela; their two daughters, Sophia 
and Teresa; Salcido's mother-in-law, Marian Louise Richards; his 
sisters-in-law, Ruth Richards, 12, and Marie Richards, 8; and winery supervisor 
Tracy Toovey. 
</P>
<P>
Only his daughter, Carmina, now 4, survived the rampage.

ON CALIFORNIA: A REQUIEM FOR CHAKA -- AND DANIEL

<TEXT>
<P>
Think back to September, 1989. A sleepy time, not much happening in the city. 
Out in the projects of downtown L.A., a teen-age kid is hanging around the 
family apartment. 
</P>
<P>
This would be Daniel Bernardo Ramos. A sweet boy, by most accounts. He's small 
for his 17 years, with calf eyes and a great affection for his skateboard. 
Daniel is the kind of kid who would ride a skateboard to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, on this evening Daniel's brother strolls by. He, the brother, has some 
spray cans and plans to decorate a few blank walls in the neighborhood. Daniel 
can come if he wants. 
</P>
<P>
So out they go, and Daniel puts a paint can in his hand for the first time. He 
wonders what he will write. Then it comes to him. He will use the nickname that 
his friends gave him several years before. "Chaka" is born. 
</P>
<P>
That was the beginning of one of the most remarkable careers in graffiti 
history. A career that apparently ended only last week. As you may know, Chaka 
is currently cooling his jets in County Jail, having been busted while writing 
his name on one more light pole. 
</P>
<P>
Before the end, it is estimated that some 10,000 Chakas had been scrawled on 
everything from freeway signs to store windows. This number is all the more 
impressive when you realize that Daniel's career lasted only 15 months. That 
comes to 25 Chakas per day, month in and month out, with no time off for 
vacations. During this period, Daniel surely did little else beside travel 
through our neighborhoods and write advertisements for himself. 
</P>
<P>
I know about Daniel's beginnings as a graffiti artist because he told me. Not 
in person. On videotape. Some months before he was busted by the Los Angeles 
Police Department, Daniel was approached by the RTD police and asked if he 
would tell Chaka's story. Since buses were not targets of Daniel's spray cans, 
the interview would be friendly. Daniel said OK; he would spill. 
</P>
<P>
What's revealed on that tape is surprising. The boy who has befouled thousands 
of urban landscapes shyly nibbles M&amp;Ms and presents himself as courteous, 
quiet and determined. This is no common goon but a young man absorbed by a 
quest. 
</P>
<P>
His work day starts at 11 p.m. and ends at 5 a.m. He sets out from home 
camouflaged as a kid headed for algebra class, never forgetting his glasses. 
You can fool the cops that way, Daniel says. In his knapsack he carries not 
books but seven spray cans -- five black and two silver. This is enough 
firepower for 85 Chakas. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the knapsack is accessory equipment as complete as any doctor's bag. 
There are paint nozzles and glass scratchers for the right effect. There are 
color-coded freeway maps and a directory of all Chief Auto Parts stores. 
</P>
<P>
The last item is maybe the most comic. The Chief is Daniel's store of choice 
for stealing paint. Since he steals so much, he knows he can't depend on any 
one branch. So he chooses a different store each week from the directory. 
</P>
<P>
This is a kid fascinated with detail. He knows you don't put up 10,000 Chakas 
without having your act together. So he uses devices such as a list of Southern 
California neighborhoods. It's an organizing tool. The neighborhoods are 
divided into "to do" and "done" categories. 
</P>
<P>
If you live in Marina del Rey, Studio City or Irvine you have been "done." 
</P>
<P>
If you live in Venice, El Monte or El Segundo, not to worry. Chaka has plans 
for you. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of competition out there," Daniel says on the tape. "It's all 
about who gets around the most." 
</P>
<P>
As for why a kid would spend most every night from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. dodging 
cops and urban predators, Daniel has his answer. By creating Chaka, he has 
created himself. Chaka/Daniel is now everywhere. When he overhears someone 
mention the notorious Chaka, Daniel says, he gets "real excited." It makes him 
want to write even more. 
</P>
<P>
And the nights spent on the streets of a dark, sleeping city have brought other 
rewards. He meets people, has adventures and plays his game with the cops. 
</P>
<P>
"It brings memories," he says, and nibbles another M&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
You wonder if Daniel is thinking about those memories in the slam. The 
prosecutors want to nail him for 48 separate counts and say they plan to put 
Daniel away for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Was Chaka worth it? This is a question that would seem laughable to most of us. 
</P>
<P>
But we are not Daniel. And somehow I get the feeling that for this kid, even 
now, the answer may not be obvious at all.

MEDELLIN CARTEL OFFERED NEW CONCESSIONS TO SURRENDER; 
</P>
<P>
COLOMBIA: GOVERNMENT PROMISES DRUG TRAFFICKERS NO EXTRADITION TO U.S. IN RETURN 
FOR CONFESSIONS TO AT LEAST ONE CRIME EACH.

<P>
The Colombian government granted Medellin drug cartel members new legal 
guarantees Monday in yet another concession to try to persuade them to turn 
themselves in. 
</P>
<P>
But the administration of President Cesar Gaviria tried to answer critics' 
charges that it is caving in to traffickers by rejecting the cartel's main 
condition for such a mass surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Medellin traffickers have denounced as unconstitutional a government 
requirement that surrendering suspects confess to at least one crime in order 
to receive lenient treatment. The government refused to drop the demand, saying 
confessions are necessary to ensure that the drug traffickers are jailed. 
</P>
<P>
"The foundation of this process is (traffickers) submitting themselves to 
Colombian justice," said Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo Angel in a Monday press 
conference. "On this point the government has not budged one millimeter." 
</P>
<P>
Giraldo was responding to strong criticism of the government's policy by 
foreign officials as well as some local press commentators and politicians. The 
critics say that the Gaviria administration is repeatedly changing the law 
according to the cartel's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier government decree, issued Sept. 5, promised no extradition to the 
United States and reduced prison sentences for traffickers who confess their 
crimes. A subsequent statement from the Extraditables, as cartel members call 
themselves, demanded that the government further clarify its promise. 
</P>
<P>
Giraldo said the new decree gives those who confess even one crime an "absolute 
guarantee" of no extradition -- a major demand of the cartel, whose members 
greatly fear being prosecuted in U.S. courts. 
</P>
<P>
The cartel statement also said the government should protect the human rights 
of its members by housing them in special compounds guarded by either the army 
or human rights groups. The cartel members have long sought to be treated in a 
category separate from common criminals. 
</P>
<P>
The government's latest decree seems to meet that demand. It stipulates that 
the attorney general's human rights office must delegate an agent to oversee 
each drug suspect's surrender and trial. The decree also says that suspected 
traffickers and terrorists will be housed in special jails -- guarded by the 
army to prevent attacks from "outside source" -- currently being prepared in 
several cities. 
</P>
<P>
The new decree states that suspects will serve no more than 30 years in prison 
no matter how many crimes they have committed. It maintains reduced sentences 
for traffickers who cooperate with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Pablo Escobar, the Medellin cartel leader accused of 
killing hundreds of people, could spend as few as 15 years in prison, Giraldo 
said. But he stressed that Escobar and others will either accept the decree and 
serve a significant sentence in Colombia or be captured and extradited. 
</P>
<P>
Giraldo's statement is unlikely to reassure those foreign and Colombian 
officials who view the government's offer of lenient treatment as mistaken, if 
not disastrous. They say Gaviria should never have shown traffickers any 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time the government makes a change in the law, the drug traffickers make 
new demands," Carlos Lemos Simmonds, a member of the president's Liberal Party 
and a former interior minister, said in a recent interview. "This process is 
not likely to end until the drug traffickers receive something approaching full 
amnesty." 
</P>
<P>
An international law enforcement official said Gaviria was making "a horrible 
mistake" by believing the promises of the Medellin cartel. He noted that 
traffickers had courted the government with a pledge to turn in their cocaine 
laboratories. But a recent report from Interpol, an international police 
agency, states that the cartel has moved a significant amount of its operations 
into neighboring countries including Brazil, Ecuador and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
"What the drug traffickers will turn over here will be the leftover garbage," 
said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia's police force, the official adds, has not eased its efforts to rid 
the country of drug traffickers and their operations. "But everyone is 
discouraged because after so many sacrifices, the government is now ready to 
cut a deal (with the cartel)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar and other cartel leaders are accused of masterminding a terrorist 
campaign that killed hundreds of Colombians, including 250 police officers in 
1989 and early this year.

LATIN SUMMIT ASSAILS SALVADOR REBEL TACTICS; 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL AMERICA: THE PRESIDENTS OF COSTA RICA, GUATEMALA, HONDURAS AND 
NICARAGUA SAY THE WARFARE IS AFFECTING THE ENTIRE REGION.

<TEXT>
<P>
El Salvador's Central American neighbors Monday condemned a month-old leftist 
guerrilla offensive against the Salvadoran government and called for a 
cease-fire and revival of face-to-face talks to end the 11-year war. 
</P>
<P>
The statement by the presidents of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and 
Nicaragua was their strongest censure of the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front. It reflected their concern that continued warfare in El 
Salvador is impeding an ambitious project to integrate the impoverished 
region's economies. 
</P>
<P>
Central American leaders said their declaration, read at the end of a 
five-nation summit, was meant to persuade the FMLN to halt its attacks so that 
full-scale peace talks can resume. Direct negotiations were last held Oct. 31, 
but United Nations mediator Alvaro de Soto has been shuttling between the two 
sides ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The FMLN has said its attacks since Nov. 20 -- which have left more than 300 
people dead and two government warplanes downed by surface-to-air missiles -- 
are intended to force Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani to trim the armed 
forces and punish military officers for human rights violations as a prelude to 
a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
But the summit declaration rebuffed the guerrillas and avoided criticizing 
well-documented abuses by the Salvadoran military or civilian casualties caused 
by air force bombings. It gave Cristiani a one-sided endorsement of what it 
called his "repeated and permanent efforts" to end the war through negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
"The process of dialogue to achieve peace has been blocked by the persistent 
violent actions of the FMLN . . . that have caused pain and death among 
Salvadoran civilians and grave damage to the country's economic 
infrastructure," the four presidents said. 
</P>
<P>
They urged the guerrillas to stop using their new anti-aircraft weapons and to 
respect El Salvador's legislative elections next March. 
</P>
<P>
They asked U.N. peacekeeping forces to stay in the region, beyond a mandate 
expiring this month, and monitor weapon flows to the rebels. And they offered 
to join U.N. mediators in seeking terms for a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the statement, Cristiani said, "The channels of negotiation are 
open." He repeated his willingness to put reform of the army atop the agenda 
for peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
Ana Guadalupe Martinez, an FMLN spokeswoman in Mexico City, said the summit 
communique "was to be expected from such a homogeneous forum." She said the 
presidents' call for an immediate cease-fire contradicts an April agreement 
between the government and the rebels to negotiate a political accord first. 
Despite the offensive, she insisted, "there is no stagnation" of U.N. mediation 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
A Costa Rican official said the presidents might sway the FMLN "because they 
have some moral authority with (the guerrillas). The guerrillas must see how 
isolated they are. Nobody is buying their offensive or the justification they 
give for it." 
</P>
<P>
Under former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez, the region's leaders 
helped settle the Contra war in Nicaragua. Their negotiations led to elections 
last February that ended leftist Sandinista rule there and to the subsequent 
disarming of U.S.-backed anti-Sandinista rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The five current presidents, all elected conservative civilians, are trying to 
turn their collective efforts to economics. At their previous summit last June, 
they created an Economic Community of the Central American Isthmus to 
coordinate trade policies, debt management, food production, environmental 
protection and the quest for foreign aid for their 30 million people. 
</P>
<P>
But the new surge of fighting in El Salvador dominated the three-day meeting at 
this Pacific beach resort. One rebel attack last week forced 200 Salvadoran 
soldiers to retreat into Honduras, reviving that nation's memories of the 
spill-over into its territory from the Nicaraguan war. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is no peace in El Salvador, there can be no economic security in 
Central America," said Honduran President Rafael L. Callejas. "Our dreams of 
free trade and unrestricted movement of people are a fallacy as long as there 
is conflict just across the border." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the presidents took modest steps here to give substance to their 
vaguely defined economic initiative. They set a deadline at the end of 1992 for 
lowering tariff and trade barriers among their countries to a uniform rate and 
eased visa requirements for officials, businessmen and professionals traveling 
from one country to another. 
</P>
<P>
They agreed to submit inventories of military manpower and hardware in each 
country by Feb. 26 -- a step toward mutual arms reductions. Within 90 days, 
they promised a regional environmental plan to halt deforestation and the 
dumping of toxic wastes. 
</P>
<P>
The summit document welcomed President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas 
proposal to create a hemispheric free-trade zone.

ECOLOGISTS ALARMED AS MEXICO CITY'S SMOG SEASON COULD BE WORST YET; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: HIGH LEVELS OF CONTAMINANTS ARE SATURATING THE AIR IN THE 
7,000-FOOT-HIGH CAPITAL.

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A quivering red sun rose over the world's largest city Monday, but rather than 
inspiring joy, dawn brought to mind a hangover-ridden morning-after as muted 
sunlight forced its way through a cloud of gaseous haze. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "smog season" has hit Mexico City with a particular vengeance 
this year, and ecologists are warning that dangerously high levels of 
contaminants are saturating the oxygen-thin air over this 7,000-foot-high 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
Windless, colder-than-usual weather is producing daily thermal inversions that 
prevent the gray veil from dispersing. The ecologists warn that this may be 
Mexico's worst winter if the government does not take stronger action soon to 
control emissions from automobiles and industry. 
</P>
<P>
"This is alarming. It is very serious," said Luis Manuel Guerra, head of the 
Autonomous Institute of Ecological Research. "If this were Los Angeles or 
Denver, we would be in an alarm situation with the concentrations of pollutants 
that we have now." 
</P>
<P>
While publicly downplaying the problem, government officials did invoke the 
first stage of an emergency Environmental Contingency Plan over the weekend to 
reduce operations by 30% at dozens of industrial plants. Officials also 
restricted operations at the 18 de Marzo oil refinery in the heart of Mexico 
City's urban sprawl, saying that a mechanical failure had caused it to spew 
toxic sulfur dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
The plant resumed full operations on Monday after the problem was fixed, 
according to Sergio Reyes Lujan, assistant secretary of ecology and urban 
development. He said the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos oil company, known as 
Pemex, would be heavily fined for the mess. 
</P>
<P>
Guerra said that his air samples show levels of lead, carbon monoxide and ozone 
two and three times higher than the maximum acceptable under Mexico's air 
quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, the maximum ozone level is 0.11 parts per million for one hour 
once a year. We have surpassed that 1,000 hours this year . . . over 300 days," 
Guerra said. Last Thursday, he said, the ozone measured .30 parts per million 
-- nearly three times the maximum. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government initiated a program called "Today, Don't Drive," 
requiring motorists to leave their cars home one day a week. Although the 
program initially produced results, ecologists say its effect has been 
neutralized by the estimated 275,000 automobiles newly registered in Mexico 
City during 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The government also began requiring semiannual exhaust tests on the estimated 3 
million cars in the capital. But critics say that corruption has diluted that 
program, too. 
</P>
<P>
"You can show up with the oldest, dirtiest car, but if you pay (a bribe), you 
pass," said Homero Aridjis, president of Mexico's Group of 100, an organization 
of leading intellectuals and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Aridjis and Guerra, the most outspoken activists on the smog issue, say the 
government should adopt a more flexible contingency plan that goes into effect 
before pollution reaches such extreme levels. Industries should be forced to 
clean up their emissions, and much of the public transportation should be 
converted to butane and propane gas. 
</P>
<P>
"In the medium and long term, industries should leave the city. The only thing 
that can salvage the city is industrial and economic decentralization," Aridjis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government announced a 21-step plan to fight pollution in 
1987 and a program of 100 actions to improve air quality in the capital in 
1988, neither of which were completed. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists are urging the government to repeat a measure taken in 
1989 prolonging Christmas vacation in public schools until February, when the 
weather warms a bit and winds pick up. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors contacted Monday said they are seeing a dramatic increase in 
respiratory ailments, particularly among children, but lack the data to 
determine whether it is due to a virus, the cold weather or pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Carlos Javier Arnaiz Toldeo, past president of the Mexican Pediatrics 
Assn., said 75% of the patients he sees now are suffering respiratory problems. 
That is about 10% above last winter. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely, during this period of cold temperatures when the layer of 
contamination is (closer to the ground) for longer periods of time, respiratory 
problems increase, and especially in children," Arnaiz said. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents of Mexico City are complaining of chronic itching eyes, 
headaches, irritability and fatigue. El Universal newspaper reported that the 
Health Ministry registered 140,000 cases of respiratory illnesses in the first 
weeks of December. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes Lujan of the Ministry of Ecology and Urban Development said such ailments 
are "normal illnesses in the winter season." He admitted that ozone is still a 
serious problem in the capital, but insisted that lead and sulfur dioxide in 
the air are down sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes Lujan said the emergency plan was put into effect over the weekend 
because the oil refinery was emitting sulfur dioxide, but Aridjis said the 
government's own measurements showed unacceptable levels of ozone and carbon 
monoxide as well for Friday through Sunday. It was the fourth time the plan has 
ever been implemented. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the contaminants reached extremely dangerous levels, some two and three 
times above the acceptable level," Aridjis said. 
</P>
<P>
"This winter is very bad," added Guerra. "If it continues, it could become the 
worst winter yet."

Genc Polo, spokesman of the five-day-old Democratic Party, said a surprise 
meeting with Prime Minister Adil Carcani was a hopeful sign that they would be 
allowed to work with the Communist authorities to quiet unrest. Rioting 
unleashed last week by promises of political reform has died down, but at least 
157 people who were arrested await trial on charges such as illegal assembly, 
looting, attempted murder and assault. Gramoz Pashko, a Democratic Party 
founder who also met with Carcani, said he asked that elections scheduled for 
Feb. 10 be postponed by several months.

ROMANIAN LEADERS MEET OPPONENTS, DISCUSS COALITION

<TEXT>
<P>
The Romanian government began unprecedented coalition talks Monday with a key 
opposition party in a bid to defuse political tension and form national unity. 
</P>
<P>
President Ion Iliescu told local radio he had begun mediating with National 
Liberal Party leader Radu Campeanu and Prime Minister Petre Roman in an effort 
to pull Romania out of its political and economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, anti-government protests broke out in the western city of Timisoara, 
cradle of the Romanian revolution a year ago, with about 15,000 people calling 
for Iliescu's resignation. At the same time, all major factories were hit by 
strikes, with workers protesting against the government's economic reform 
program, price liberalization, low wages and food shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu said, "The talks concentrated on a dialogue and negotiations to be 
conducted over the next few days. The NLP pledged to contact other opposition 
parties to find possible solutions for co-participation in government by 
opposition parties." 
</P>
<P>
Roman said there is a good chance the talks will yield concrete results. "We 
shall see ways to share responsibilities at a moment which is by no means easy 
for the country." 
</P>
<P>
Campeanu and four National Liberal Party colleagues were negotiating with 
Roman, ruling National Salvation Front Vice President Claudiu Iordache and the 
front's parliamentary leaders, Alexandru Barladeanu and Dan Martian. 
</P>
<P>
Political sources said that Campeanu hopes to gain four Cabinet portfolios -- 
possibly the ministries of trade, agriculture, education and labor. Campeanu 
ultimately wants Roman's job. 
</P>
<P>
The main grudge against Roman is that he unleashed harsh austerity by 
liberalizing prices last month and ending four decades of Communist-style price 
subsidies. Iliescu's chief flaw in the eye of his opponents is that he is an 
unrepentant Communist with autocratic ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
The National Liberals are one of six major parliamentary opposition parties 
that formed a united front last Saturday as the ruling front faced popular 
opposition and labor and student strikes.

INDIA'S TAJ MAHAL CITY NOW GHOST TOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
The Taj Mahal city of Agra has become a virtual ghost town after at least 11 
people were killed there in the Hindu-Muslim violence gripping India. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people have died across the nation since Dec. 7 in violence 
sparked by a dispute over a shrine in Ayodhya in the northern state of Uttar 
Pradesh. Officials describe the violence as among the worst since India gained 
independence 43 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In Agra, also in Uttar Pradesh, police spokesman M. P. Solanki said Monday that 
at least 11 people have been killed and 28 injured in Hindu-Muslim clashes 
since Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers, paramilitary units and police patrolled the streets and stood guard 
around the Taj Mahal, closed since the fighting broke out. The soldiers turned 
back two Australian tourists who tried to enter the grounds of the sparkling 
marble masterpiece of 17th-Century Muslim architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The huge wooden gates were shut, and an official said it was too dangerous to 
allow anyone inside the Taj Mahal, built by the Muslim ruler Shah Jehan in 
memory of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The official appeared to be referring to fears that Hindu extremists might make 
a target of the Taj Mahal, one of the few popular destinations left for 
tourists visiting India. 
</P>
<P>
An indefinite curfew and heavy security kept most people off Agra's streets, 
and nearly every shop was boarded up. 
</P>
<P>
The Hindu militants are campaigning to claim the Ayodhya site as the birthplace 
of the Hindu god-king Lord Rama. They say Muslim invaders razed a temple on 
Lord Rama's birthplace in 1528 to build a monument to the Islamic conquest of 
India. 
</P>
<P>
In New Delhi, Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar said that he is prepared to use 
"any amount of force needed" if dialogue fails to halt the Hindu-Muslim riots. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain people are trying to create trouble. They are exploiting this thing," 
he said in an interview with Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
The sectarian violence helped bring down his predecessor, Prime Minister V. P. 
Singh, about a month ago. Parliament then gave Shekhar a vote of confidence to 
form a new government. 
</P>
<P>
He said Monday that he is optimistic that dialogue can defuse the sectarian 
rivalries and fears that have spurred Hindus and Muslims to murderous riots in 
several cities. Mobs have slaughtered infants with axes, burned people alive 
and lynched passengers on passing trains. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to grapple with the situation," Shekhar said, adding: "We 
want to deal with the situation with restraint and patience." 
</P>
<P>
Shekhar, a veteran politician, tends to speak in political platitudes in 
public. But he has a reputation for tough-minded effectiveness when it comes to 
wheeling and dealing in private with his friends and foes. 
</P>
<P>
Shekhar said his willingness to make political deals and engage in dialogue 
should not be interpreted as a sign of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he said he soon will present a new peace plan for Punjab, where Sikh 
extremists have killed more than 3,100 people this year, the highest annual 
toll since they launched their separatist campaign in 1982.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III told NATO allies that Iraq might 
partially withdraw from Kuwait as a ploy to divide the coalition arrayed 
against it. The foreign ministers of the 16 NATO nations then issued a 
statement reiterating that Iraq must completely and unconditionally withdraw 
from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush insisted that there will be "no negotiations, no concessions for 
one inch of territory." 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council said Iraq will not allow the 
United States to dictate the date of a meeting between Saddam Hussein and 
Baker, saying to do so would be "surrender." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>

Iraqi civil defense officials have opened 342 training centers, the Iraqi media 
reported. It also said that the Iraqi Defense Ministry has recalled men born in 
1957 to boost the mobilization in Kuwait and southern Iraq.

Soviet diplomats began negotiating for the release of at least 2,000 Soviet

terminate the contracts of the Soviet workers in Iraq. 
</P>

Meanwhile, Britain's ambassador to Kuwait and his consul -- the last two 
Western diplomats in Kuwait -- boarded a plane and headed for London. The 
British Foreign Office also advised the 10,400 British women and children in 
Bahrain, Qatar and parts of Saudi Arabia to leave before Jan. 15.

CHILDREN'S SEDATIVE MAY BE CARCINOGENIC, FDA TOLD

Food and Drug Administration officials said Monday that they were looking into 
reports that a drug commonly used to sedate children may cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The concerns were raised by California Health Director Kenneth Kizer, who said 
that, if carcinogenity is confirmed by an Environmental Protection Agency 
study, the FDA should issue a warning. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to FDA Commissioner David Kessler last week, Kizer said interim 
results from the EPA study found cancer in mice that had been given oral 
chloral hydrate. 
</P>
<P>
"Interviews with health-care professionals who prescribe, dispense and 
administer chloral hydrate, including neonatologists, pediatricians, 
pedodontists and hospital pharmacists, indicate that these practitioners are 
unaware of the carcinogenic risks of this drug," Kizer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer sent with his letter brief summaries of more than 20 studies conducted 
during the 1970s and 1980s involving chloral hydrate. The findings ranged from 
changes in cell development to genetic mutations. In one study, young mice 
developed cancer after a single dose. 
</P>
<P>
FDA spokeswoman Eva Kemper said that the agency had received the letter but 
that "at this point we have no comment." 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials conducting the study in Cincinnati, Ohio, had left for the day 
and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Chloral hydrate has been sold for many years as a branded and a generic product 
for use as a hypnotic and sedative. 
</P>
<P>
It is used by doctors and dentists as a sedative for children to keep them 
still for examinations. Also, neonatologists give it to newborns on 
ventilators.

A company is betting Americans so dearly want to fly in space that they will 
pay to enter a sweepstakes for a chance to win a trip aboard a Soviet rocket 
and a week on the space station Mir. 
</P>
<P>
"Our long-term business strategy is to arrange for space travel opportunities 
for anyone who wishes to go into space," James Davidson of Space Travel 
Services said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Would-be American cosmonauts can call 1-900-258-2MIR -- at a cost of $2.99 per 
call -- to enter a random drawing. Space Travel gets more than half of that 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials could not be reached Monday to confirm the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
But Americans reacted immediately to the contest offer. Thousands of calls to 
the number Monday overloaded the service company's circuits and made the line 
inaccessible, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the problem should be corrected by today. 
</P>
<P>
The winner, to be selected in December, 1991, gets six months of training, 
including Russian language lessons, and a seat on a Soviet rocket in late 1992 
or early 1993, plus $500,000 cash.

<P>
In an Administration where most of the power and glamour have been focused on 
foreign policy, President Bush's choice to head the Department of Education is 
likely to emerge rapidly as a major force in shaping the domestic side of the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Lamar Alexander is also likely to join the already long list of Administration 
figures who are talked about as potential presidential candidates when Bush 
leaves office -- a list that includes Housing and Urban Development Secretary 
Jack Kemp, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
and Vice President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
All that will be quite a change for the Education Department, whose former 
leader, Lauro F. Cavazos, was virtually never heard from prior to his 
resignation under fire last week. 
</P>
<P>
As a Republican, Alexander is a self-described "activist" who has consistently 
prodded his party to support an expansive problem-solving role for state and 
local governments. 
</P>
<P>
In his own eight years as Tennessee governor, Alexander focused on two 
interrelated problems -- education and jobs. He won applause for an ambitious 
program to improve the state's schools and attract major new employers, 
particularly General Motors' huge new Saturn plant. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander commented on the two during a brief appearance with Bush at the White 
House on Monday morning. The two questions employers ask when looking for a 
place to relocate, Alexander said, are: "Where can I get good schools for our 
children?" and "Where can I go back to school?" 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to be competitive, if we're going to keep our good jobs, we're 
going to have to answer those questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer by training, Alexander, 50, married and the father of four, has spent 
much of his adult life in politics. At 26, he signed on as an aide to another 
attorney, Howard H. Baker Jr., who was then running for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
When Baker won, Alexander went with him to Washington. A few years later, he 
moved to the White House as executive assistant to Bryce Harlow, President 
Richard M. Nixon's congressional relations adviser. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, immediately after the Watergate scandal, Alexander's Nixon connection 
helped sink his bid for Tennessee's governorship. But four years later, after 
another stint as an aide to Baker, then Senate Republican leader, and a job as 
a television commentator on a Nashville station, Alexander won easily. 
</P>
<P>
As governor, Alexander anticipated the current movement among Republican 
conservatives toward establishing a "new paradigm" for the party to fill the 
vacuum left by the loss of anti-communism as an issue and the weakening of the 
party's stand against taxes. 
</P>
<P>
His ideas, now reflected in the "empowerment agenda" pushed by Bush 
Administration conservatives, were intended to help Republicans match the 
Democrats' focus on dealing with the problems of schools, highways, public 
health and other nuts-and-bolts programs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Alexander convened a little-noticed meeting in Tennessee's Smoky 
Mountains. In attendance were three other Republican governors -- John H. 
Sununu, then governor of New Hampshire, now White House chief of staff; Dick 
Thornburgh, then governor of Pennsylvania, now attorney general; and James G. 
Martin, then as now chief executive of North Carolina -- and a group of 
conservative GOP House activists led by Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the meeting was to lay the groundwork for what the participants 
called the "Reagan Revolution, Stage Two," which was intended to help 
Republican candidates in the 1986 elections. One big theme: making the United 
States more competitive through state and local efforts at improving school 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander chided GOP activists at a March, 1986, Southern Republican leadership 
conference in Nashville, suggesting the party was failing to focus adequately 
on those issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Washington issues" -- foreign policy, the federal budget and welfare -- are 
"tremendously important and so fascinating," Alexander said. "But when we get 
together, that's all we talk about, and the Democratic governors are running 
down the street proposing programs to improve the schools, clean up the 
garbage, fix the roads and make the children more healthy -- and they get 
elected."

Ed Parker, credited with bringing the traditional style of Chinese karate to 
the United States and who later owned an international chain of karate schools 
bearing his name, died Saturday night, it was reported Monday. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, who lived in Pasadena, once was a bodyguard for Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
He collapsed shortly after arrival at Honolulu Airport and died of a massive 
heart attack en route to Kaiser Hospital, according to David Parker, a nephew. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, a native of Hawaii, earned a black belt in karate and then moved to 
California, where he opened his first school in Pasadena in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
He said he learned karate in his native Honolulu to protect himself from other 
youngsters who taunted him because he did not drink or smoke. A devout Mormon, 
Parker studied sociology and psychology at Brigham Young University. 
</P>
<P>
For 27 years, Parker staged an annual karate tournament in Long Beach. At the 
1964 tournament Parker introduced Bruce Lee, who later starred in a series of 
kung fu films. 
</P>
<P>
His students also included producer Blake Edwards, who featured Parker in one 
of the "Pink Panther" movies. Parker, a burly six-footer with long gray hair, 
also was choreographer and martial arts expert for a number of other films. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his widow, Leilani, and five children.

SMALL QUAKE STRIKES BIG BEAR AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small earthquake jolted the Big Bear Lake area Monday morning, causing some 
jitters but no damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The quake had a magnitude of 3.5 and struck at 9:44 a.m., said Katrin Douglas, 
a researcher at the California Institute of Technology's Seismology Laboratory 
in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The temblor was centered 16 miles northeast of San Bernardino in the mountains 
below the lake, Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
The quake was apparently felt from Lake Arrowhead to Orange County, authorities 
said. Bill Shackelford, a California Highway Patrol officer in Running Springs, 
was close to the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it all right," Shackelford said. "I was at my desk, writing reports. . 
. . It was like an explosion, like a sonic boom right over our building. It 
didn't last long, but it was powerful." 
</P>
<P>
Shackelford said the CHP received about half a dozen calls from curious 
residents, and other law enforcement agencies reported scattered inquiries. 
Douglas said the quake did not appear related to any other temblor.

PROPOSAL TO REDUCE RENTERS TAX CREDIT ASSAILED; 
</P>
<P>
STATE FINANCE: FOES OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET-TRIMMING PLAN TELL A LOS ANGELES 
HEARING IT AMOUNTS TO SPECIAL TAX INCREASE THAT WOULD HURT THE POOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal by lame-duck Gov. George Deukmejian to reduce the renters tax credit 
was strongly denounced Monday as a special tax increase on the poor during a 
rare hearing in Los Angeles by the state Senate Budget and Fiscal Review 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Majority-party Democrats opposed to the governor's plan moved the hearing from 
Sacramento because of the high renter population here. Renters constitute about 
65% of the households in Los Angeles, or 817,000 families, according to city 
housing officials. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's proposal would reduce the credit to a flat $52 a year, down from 
the current credit of $120 for married couples, heads of households and 
surviving spouses and $60 for individuals. Those amounts are paid to all 
renters, even people such as welfare recipients who have no taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the governor's plan in Los Angeles was predictable as Mayor Tom 
Bradley led a group of critics in the County Board of Supervisors hearing room 
in voicing strong disapproval of the governor's budget move. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley called the proposal "an insult to the people of this state who can 
least afford it." The Democratic mayor released figures showing that of the 2.2 
million households that qualify for the credit statewide, more than two-thirds 
have incomes of $10,000 a year or less. In Los Angeles, the average renter 
earns $26,000 annually, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Squier, head of Bradley's housing program, sharply disagreed with the 
portrayal of the proposal by the Republican Deukmejian as elimination of a 
benefit, arguing that "it will have the identical effect of a tax increase." 
</P>
<P>
The credit dates back to passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, which dramatically 
reduced taxes for property owners. Lawmakers created the special tax program to 
provide some equality to renters in the face of huge benefits given to property 
owners when the initiative passed. 
</P>
<P>
With the state facing a potential $800-million deficit in the current year's 
budget and a shortfall next year in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion, 
Deukmejian offered up the renters credit reduction as part of a $1-billion 
emergency plan of cuts and revenue increases. 
</P>
<P>
But the governor's plan, which also called for a reduction in funding for 
public schools of $526 million annually, fell on its face almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, lawmakers said they would rather wait and deal with Pete Wilson 
after the governor-elect is sworn in Jan. 7 before tackling a comprehensive 
budget plan. 
</P>
<P>
More specifically, Democrats criticized the proposal because it would single 
out low-income Californians for an extra tax bite. The plan ignored a tradition 
in the Legislature of dealing with renter and homeowner tax benefits together 
as a matter of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing Monday, Gail Greer Lyle, director of the nonpartisan 
Commission on State Finance, fueled the controversy when she released a chart 
showing that bank and corporation taxes over the last five years have steadily 
declined, in part because of tax breaks approved by the Legislature in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
David Hamlin, president of the Park La Brea Tenants Assn., said, "I was 
astounded to hear that the bank and corporation taxes in California have been 
dropping steadily. I don't think it is appropriate to ask the renters, who 
represent the lowest level of income earners in this state, to make up the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), one of five Los 
Angeles-area lawmakers who attended the hearing, said he and other Democrats 
strongly oppose the governor's plan. Roberti said it makes no sense to target 
renters for tax increases when wealthier corporate and individual taxpayers are 
not touched. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the nine people who testified during the three-hour hearing was in 
favor of the governor's move. James S. Dwight Jr., chief deputy director of the 
Department of Finance, defended the proposal in light of the state's pressing 
budget problems.

CALIFORNIA &amp; CO.: YOU'LL FIND WELFARE IN THEM THAR HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL AKST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Welfare saps initiative, right? Generation after generation, it creates a 
culture of dependence. 
</P>
<P>
Sure. Doubters need only look to the minerals mining industry, a business so 
addicted to government handouts that it apparently can barely lift a shovel 
without taxpayer help. 
</P>
<P>
California is having a second great gold rush. It's a leader in boron and 
gypsum too, producing $3 billion a year in non-fuel minerals overall and 
ranking second only to Arizona. But the interesting thing about minerals mining 
is how perfectly its checkered history recapitulates much of what ails American 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Here was a mighty industry built on dazzling natural abundance and unbridled 
domestic growth. It was blessed with sweetheart legislation and enjoyed a 
degree of worldwide pre-eminence. But it resisted innovation, relying instead 
on its ability to extract private profit at public expense, especially by 
ignoring the cost of the environmental degradation that it had a habit of 
leaving behind. 
</P>
<P>
Times got tough in the early 1980s, and the industry was brutally restructured. 
The result, nowadays, is a scaled-down but profitable $30-billion-a-year 
business that seems to lack the will -- and possibly the wherewithal -- to 
invest in its own future. 
</P>
<P>
That's a shame. In California, tougher environmental rules and lower-grade ores 
will increasingly demand higher technology, but the minerals and metals 
companies aren't likely to have it. 
</P>
<P>
"Expenditures for internal and contracted R&amp;D declined from $133.5 million 
in 1980 to $22.5 million in 1988," says the startling new report of a special 
panel commissioned by the National Research Council, which advises the 
government on such things. By contrast, federal spending on mining research -- 
excluding safety -- was $86 million in fiscal 1989. Ray Beebe, vice chairman of 
the panel and an astute senior vice president at Homestake Mining Co. in San 
Francisco, adds: "Much of the technology in use today was already on the shelf 
in the late 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
Take gold. California's 1989 output was $367 million, second only to Nevada's. 
Our gold boom has been abetted by U.S. Bureau of Mines research into "heap 
leaching" -- soaking pulverized rock in cyanide to extract the ore. The 
technique is so cheap that it can pay to mine 20 tons of rock for one ounce of 
gold, and it was developed partly at taxpayer expense when gold was cheap. But 
the U.S. gold mining industry probably spends less than $7 million of its own 
on research and development annually. 
</P>
<P>
What's the solution? More public assistance, of course. The study panel 
recommends greater cooperation between government, universities and mining 
companies to make the technological leaps the industry so badly needs. 
</P>
<P>
But the panel didn't flatly recommend the most obvious thing of all: that 
mining companies spend more on research. 
</P>
<P>
Given the industry's history, that omission is perhaps less than startling. 
Corporate welfare is practically second nature to these folks. Much of American 
minerals mining occurs on federal land, and thanks to a classic government 
giveaway, mining interests pay Uncle Sam nothing for the ores they extract. 
</P>
<P>
The mining law of 1872, drafted and guided through Congress by mining industry 
mouthpiece and Nevada Sen. William Morris Stewart, lets miners reap minerals on 
federal lands for free. Not only that; if a miner or mining concern really 
likes a tract, they can buy it, for $5 an acre or less. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, miners took the ore and left behind a mess, but when the land is 
worth keeping, they take it. Reviewing 20 such deals since 1970, the General 
Accounting Office found that the government got less than $4,500 for lands 
valued in 1988 at $13.8 million to $47.9 million. Predictable horror stories 
include the giveaway of federal lands in suburban Phoenix and Las Vegas and 
next to ski resorts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, miners paid $170 for 34 federal acres near Sonora, Calif., in Gold 
Country; local realtors figured the land was worth perhaps $510,000. Since 
1872, a combined area larger than Connecticut has been ceded this way 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. land and mineral giveaways have historically characterized settlement of 
the West, but by now the government gets decently paid for oil, gas, coal and 
timber from its -- our -- land. Nor does it routinely cede title without 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Gold, copper, gypsum and other such minerals remain the great exception. Nobody 
seems to know what proportion of mining revenue is drawn from federal lands -- 
a group lobbying to change the law guesses $4 billion a year -- but even the 
American Mining Congress, the trade and lobbying group, admits that most known 
metallic mineral reserves in the West are on U.S. property, which is vast. The 
U.S. government owns nearly half of California, for example. 
</P>
<P>
An 8%-royalty plan died in Congress last year but is likely to be revived soon. 
Aghast, the industry says that exacting payment for the minerals will hurt the 
competitiveness of U.S. mining companies and that tampering with the law will 
let environmentalists change it somehow so they can tie the miners up in 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
No property owner in his right mind would buy that. Anyone who finds gold in my 
back yard is going to pay me for it, and California, among other states, 
agrees. You want to mine state property? You pay the state. 
</P>
<P>
The miners are right about one thing: Like environmental regulations, 
government royalty or leasing requirements will raise the lowest level of ore 
the companies can profitably mine -- at least until new technologies come 
along. 
</P>
<P>
But these are unlikely, considering the sorry state of the industry's knowledge 
infrastructure. California's only full four-year mining program is at UC 
Berkeley, where undergraduate enrollment in the field is a dismal 14. Mike 
Hood, a Berkeley mining professor who looked into this, says enrollment at the 
six major Western mining colleges is down 80% since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Will the U.S. cavalry ride to the rescue? Hardly. Those pesky federal deficits 
are still with us; Bureau of Mines staffing is off 20% since 1980, and its 
research spending is way down. 
</P>
<P>
But before you get mad at the miners -- and we're not talking about the odd 
grizzled prospector here, although they're also to blame -- remember that the 
industry isn't unusually greedy in all this. 
</P>
<P>
Subsidy-addicted farmers aren't much different. Nor are holders of broadcasting 
licenses. Much of the middle class gets its goodies, too. Where is it written 
in stone that home mortgage interest must be tax deductible? 
</P>
<P>
Hood says prior advances in technology helped mining bounce back from its 1980s 
depression. But he worries that "in the event of another downturn, there won't 
be any R&amp;D to implement to save the industry again." 
</P>
<P>
Could there be a larger message in all this? Gee, let's hope not.

YEAR-END TAX-SAVING PLOYS ARE HARDER TO FIND, LESS LUCRATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government has taken the fun out of the year-end tax dodge. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, avoiding taxes could be exciting. It caused people to invest in wind 
farms, cattle ranches and oil wells. Some would hire their 3-year-olds and pay 
them exorbitant salaries. Others might claim their dogs as dependents. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so some of it was shady. At least it was interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Now, because of tax legislation passed by Congress and stricter rules enforced 
by the Internal Revenue Service, the choices are less lucrative -- and far less 
dicey. 
</P>
<P>
You can give money to charity, prepay a few bills, sell some investments and 
put money away for retirement. Still, the chance of dramatically reducing your 
tax is slight. 
</P>
<P>
"People who tell you they can solve all your year-end tax problems are probably 
going to charge you more in fees than they'll save you in tax," sighed Gregg 
Ritchie, partner with the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, because of new tax rules that go into effect next year, you might want 
to avoid tax avoidance altogether this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally you would want to defer income and accelerate deductions to postpone 
tax liability," said Tim Kochis, national director of personal financial 
planning at Deloitte &amp; Touche in San Francisco. "But since the top marginal 
rate goes up to 31% next year from 28% this year, that logic often reverses 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
Some people might at least think about paying more tax this year to pay less 
next year, Kochis added. 
</P>
<P>
Given all this, there are still a few things you can do to reduce your 1990 tax 
bite. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best options is to put money aside for retirement, Kochis said. How 
you do this will depend on a variety of factors, including how much you earn 
annually and where you are employed. 
</P>
<P>
If your company has a 401(k) plan, you should consider contributing the maximum 
amount allowable, which is $7,979 in 1990. (The allowable amount is indexed for 
inflation.) These plans have two advantages: Money contributed is taken out 
before tax, and interest earned on the account accrues tax-free until the money 
is withdrawn at retirement. 
</P>
<P>
What does that mean in dollars and cents? 
</P>
<P>
Consider a couple earning $100,000 annually. They are in the so-called bubble 
bracket, which means that they pay 33% in federal tax for every dollar earned 
over a certain amount. If they contribute the maximum amount to a 401(k) plan, 
they will save $2,633 in federal tax and $742 more on their California return, 
said Phil Holthouse, partner at the West Los Angeles accounting firm Parks 
Palmer Turner &amp; Yemenidjian. In other words, the government is paying for 
nearly half of their retirement savings. 
</P>
<P>
If you are self-employed, or have at least some self-employment income, you can 
also start a Keogh plan, Holthouse added. These plans are similar to a 401(k) 
but may allow larger contributions. The IRS limits deductions to the lesser of 
13% of self-employment income or $30,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
And many taxpayers can take advantage of individual retirement accounts. These 
accounts allow for tax-deductible contributions of $2,000 annually if your 
income is less than $25,000 individually or $40,000 for a married couple. And 
taxpayers who have no pension plan at work may contribute to an IRA at any 
income level. 
</P>
<P>
Another tax-saving strategy: Pay your January mortgage in December. This allows 
you to deduct the interest expense in 1990 instead of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Some individuals might consider prepaying property and state taxes, too. 
However, the advantage of getting a deduction for these payments needs to be 
weighed carefully against the disadvantage of losing the use of that money for 
the three or four months between the time you pay the bill and the actual due 
date. 
</P>
<P>
For example, say you needed to pay $5,000 in state taxes in April. If you paid 
that early, you would save $1,400 in 1990, assuming a 28% federal tax bracket. 
However, since you are using up 1991's deduction in 1990, you are only 
deferring the tax payment for one year, not avoiding it altogether. So in 
reality, your only real gain is the interest you've earned on the $1,400 
deferral. Assuming an 8% rate of return, you would have earned $112 on your 
$1,400. But, had you invested the whole $5,000 for four months, you would have 
earned slightly more -- about $133. 
</P>
<P>
If, however, you are now in the 33% "bubble" bracket, accelerating these 
deductions could make sense again because your tax rate may drop slightly next 
year, said Mark Collins, partner at Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. in Los Angeles. 
In other words, this year's deductions are worth comparatively more and next 
year's comparatively less. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if you are like most middle-income individuals and your tax rate is 
set to climb next year, the opposite is true. The deduction would be more 
valuable in 1991, Kochis said. 
</P>
<P>
Philanthropic-minded individuals can time their charitable contributions to get 
the maximum allowable tax benefit, too. Again, if you are currently in the 
highest tax bracket of 33%, you might want to consider making these 
contributions before year-end. If you are in the 28% bracket, you might want to 
wait until next year. 
</P>
<P>
Other tax-saving ideas: 
</P>
<P>
* Consider bunching up business and medical expenses. Because deductions for 
these expenses are valuable only if they exceed a certain percentage of your 
income, you might want to try to accelerate or defer these expenses to get them 
all into one year. That would include having elective surgery in the same year 
as you had other large medical expenses or paying for business publications and 
union dues up-front. Notably, too, cosmetic surgery will not be deductible in 
1991, so get those nose jobs now. 
</P>
<P>
* Pay off consumer debt. Interest paid on credit cards, car loans and other 
types of consumer debt are 10% deductible in 1990. But you'll get no deduction 
in 1991, Collins noted. Consequently, pay off as many of these debts as you 
possibly can this year. 
</P>
<P>
* If you have unrealized investment losses, you might consider selling the 
investment to trigger the loss for tax purposes. You can use the loss to offset 
investment gains and up to $3,000 of other income. Be aware, however, that if 
you repurchase the same security within 30 days, the IRS will won't allow the 
deduction. 
</P>
<P>
* If you are planning to buy luxury items or a gas-guzzling car, you might want 
to do it before year end. In 1991, the government will impose a special tax on 
luxury items that cost more than specific amounts. And the gas-guzzler tax will 
double. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
YEAR-END TAX TIPS 
</P>
<P>
Determine if your tax rate next year will be higher than this year's. If so, 
you may wish to defer many deductions until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Contribute the maximum allowed to your tax-deferred retirement program, such as 
an IRA, Keogh or 401(k) plan. 
</P>
<P>
Make your January mortgage payment in December. 
</P>
<P>
Contribute to charity. 
</P>
<P>
Pay off consumer debt if possible; interest payments on these debts will not be 
deductible next year.

MACY LINES UP $162.6 MILLION IN BAILOUT FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: THE FRESH CASH FROM SOME TOP SHAREHOLDERS WILL LET IT TRIM DEBT AND, 
SOME ANALYSTS SAY, AVOID FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Debt-burdened R. H. Macy &amp; Co., easing persistent worries about its 
financial health, on Monday announced agreements with investors expected to 
bring the company at least $162.6 million in fresh cash. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts had said that the New York-based retailer, owner of Southern 
California's Bullock's and I. Magnin stores, could collapse early next year if 
it suffered a weak Christmas season and failed to attract a big bailout 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
But the new batch of investment agreements will let the company reduce its debt 
and "definitely keeps them out of Chapter 11 (bankruptcy) for a year or two," 
giving Macy's time to turn around its business, said Thomas R. Razukas, an 
analyst with Fitch Investors Service. 
</P>
<P>
For Macy's forceful chairman, Edward S. Finkelstein, the announcement was an 
important victory in his campaign to calm the fears of suppliers and lenders. 
Two weeks ago, Finkelstein lambasted critics in an open letter published in the 
trade paper Women's Wear Daily. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted at the time that Macy's has no plans to close stores or to sell 
divisions, and he disputed assertions that this holiday shopping season could 
"make or break Macy's." 
</P>
<P>
Macy's had announced on Nov. 1 that it was planning to raise about $150 million 
through a stock offering, with its four biggest shareholders contributing 
two-thirds of the total. Still, analysts then raised concerns that investors 
would wait to see how Macy's fared in the crucial holiday shopping season 
before actually committing any money. 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, despite a slow economy that has dampened business at Macy's and 
at other big U.S. retailers, the company said its non-management shareholders 
agreed to buy $119 million of preferred stock. That deal is expected to close 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the money is to come from the four top shareholders -- GE Capital 
Corp., Loews Corp., Mutual Series Fund and Taubman Investment Co. 
</P>
<P>
Another $18.6 million in preferred stock is being sold to "several shopping 
center developers" led by an affiliate of New York-based Corporate Property 
Investors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Macy's confirmed that it is negotiating a deal with Hong Kong 
entertainment mogul Sir Run Run Shaw. Macy's said Shaw has agreed in principle 
to buy $25 million of Macy's preferred stock and has an option to buy $25 
million more by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
If that option is exercised, it would bring the total investment from the deals 
announced Monday to nearly $188 million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned, however, that Macy's still faces big financial problems and 
will likely need another major investment to cover big interest payments coming 
due in 1993. The company is weighed down by $5.6 billion in debt, largely from 
the buyout that took it private in 1986 and the acquisition of the I. Magnin 
and Bullock's chains in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not out of the woods yet," said analyst Evan I. Mann of Dillon Read 
&amp; Co. "This just gives them some breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
Macy's plans to use its new funds to buy back junk bond debt, and it is 
planning to do the same with its $100 million in proceeds from the expected 
sale of its credit subsidiaries in January or February. Analyst Barbara 
Wedelstaedt of the Chicago investment firm Duff &amp; Phelps estimated that the 
buybacks will save the company $120 million in interest expenses this year and 
$250 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
The company's various categories of junk bonds, which all trade at depressed 
prices of less than 50 cents on the dollar, climbed about 2 cents on the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Macy's announcement follows Friday's news that Carter Hawley Hale Stores, the 
Los Angeles-based owner of the Broadway-Southern California, cut its burdensome 
debt load by completing the sale of its Richmond, Va.-based Thalhimers chain to 
May Department Stores for $317 million.

Drexel Blasts Regulators: Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. accused thrift regulators 
of inventing and exaggerating some of the government's $6.8 billion in damage 
claims against the collapsed Wall Street firm. 
</P>
<P>
In papers filed in Manhattan federal court, Drexel also accused the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. and Resolution Trust Corp. of seeking to blame the 
former junk-bond pioneer for the savings and loan industry collapse. The 
agencies contended last month that Drexel contributed to the failure of more 
than 40 thrifts by fraudulent sales of risky high-yield bonds. Drexel said the 
regulators' actions were threatening to derail its bankruptcy reorganization 
and jeopardize its negotiations with creditors.

ZENITH, AT&amp;T OFFER PLAN FOR DIGITAL HDTV; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: THE SYSTEM, WHICH COULD BECOME THE U.S. STANDARD, SHOULD MAKE IT 
EASIER TO LINK COMPUTERS WITH TELEVISION.

Solidifying their strong position in the race to develop an American 
high-definition television (HDTV) system, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph 
and Zenith Electronics on Monday announced a new all-digital version of the 
HDTV broadcasting scheme that they will present to the Federal Communications 
Commission next year. 
</P>
<P>
The companies said that digital transmission -- which sends information as a 
series of ones and zeros rather than as a modulated electrical wave -- would 
reduce interference and assure that even television viewers receiving a weak 
broadcast signal would see an unadulterated HDTV picture. 
</P>
<P>
HDTV will vastly improve the quality of pictures and sound available on 
television sets, and the new generation of TVs and related equipment is 
expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue for consumer electronics 
companies in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies have a big lead in HDTV technology, but the FCC rejected the 
Japanese HDTV system as a standard for the United States because it is not 
compatible with existing television broadcasts. Following a series of tests 
beginning next year, the FCC will select a U.S. standard for HDTV sometime in 
1993. It now appears it will be a digital system. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the nearly 2-year-old AT&amp;T-Zenith partnership, competitors 
in the U.S. HDTV race include General Instruments, the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (which has developed a modified 
version of the Japanese system), and a consortium that includes Thomson of 
France, Philips of the Netherlands, the David Sarnoff Research Laboratory and 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, General Instruments surprised the HDTV world with the announcement 
that it had developed an all-digital HDTV format, and the Thomson-Philips group 
said it would have a digital system as well. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Cripps, publisher of HDTV Newsletter, said he would not be surprised if 
MIT came out with a digital proposal, but added that too little technical 
information was available about any of the systems to judge which was better. 
</P>
<P>
Digital HDTV, in addition to offering better quality, should also make it 
easier to link computers with television, since computers also use the ones and 
zeros of digital code as their internal language. The merger of television and 
computers is seen by many as the next wave in electronics. 
</P>
<P>
The new AT&amp;T-Zenith system will send regular TV signals on existing 
channels while sending digital HDTV signals on unused channels that currently 
serve as buffers between stations. The digital HDTV signals are compressed via 
sophisticated algorithms and then sent at very low power to eliminate 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal also promises to offer better pictures than other HDTV systems 
by increasing the number of lines on the screen, and by using so-called 
progressive scan to refresh the image.

Date for New GATT Talks Set: To try to revive trade talks that collapsed this 
month, the head of the governing body on world trade called on negotiators to 
return to the bargaining table Jan. 15. The session was called by Arthur 
Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. There 
has been no sign that the positions among GATT nations have changed enough -- 
especially in the key area of farm subsidies -- to salvage efforts to 
liberalize global trade.

UNIVERSAL STUDIOS PLANS $100-MILLION EXPANSION; 
</P>
<P>
THEME PARKS: MCA SAYS IT WILL COMPLETE THE PROJECT -- WHICH INCLUDES LUCILLE 
BALL AND "E.T." ATTRACTIONS -- BY THE BUSY SUMMER SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The battle for Southern California theme park supremacy intensified Monday as 
MCA Inc. announced that two of Hollywood's great icons, "E.T." and Lucille 
Ball, will be saluted with new attractions as part of a $100-million expansion 
of Universal Studios Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
MCA executives said the changes will bring tour visitors closer to the 
filmmaking process. Universal plans to revamp its tram service, cutting the 
ride from 2 hours to 45 minutes. It will also provide better access to the 
studio back lot and the special-effects stages. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Bension, president of MCA's recreation division, said the work will be 
completed in time for the busy summer season. The expansion is the biggest in 
the 26-year-old theme park's history. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the past four years, we've made dramatic changes and improvements, from 
parking to new attractions," Bension said. "This is a continuation of that 
ongoing reinvestment into the park. . . . It will be a whole new experience for 
visitors, especially local ones." 
</P>
<P>
News of the expansion comes just a few weeks after MCA agreed to be purchased 
by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. for $6.59 billion. Bension said the plan 
is unrelated to the sale of the company because construction started nearly a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The upgrading appears to have been motivated at least partially by the growing 
competition among such rivals as Disneyland, Magic Mountain and Knott's Berry 
Farm for a weakening tourist dollar. After a record-setting year in 1989, 
Universal Studios Hollywood revenues declined to $115 million for the first 
nine months of this year, compared to $118 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
MCA is also coming off a disappointing first season at its $630-million 
Universal Studios Florida, which was plagued by mechanical difficulties on its 
attractions until recently. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment analysts said the Universal Studios Hollywood expansion makes 
sense economically. "They have to doll the place up," said Jeffrey Logsdon of 
Seidler Amdec Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Vogel of Merrill Lynch said the Southern California tour could be 
considered primitive by current standards. "It's been around a long time, so it 
wouldn't be at all surprising that they would need to do some modernizing and 
updating," Vogel said. "And $100 million is not a lot of money these days. It's 
probably a necessity these days just to stay competitive." 
</P>
<P>
The new attractions will be added gradually. The tribute to Lucille Ball opens 
March 15 and will feature the original "I Love Lucy" set. "E.T.'s Adventure" is 
set to open June 1. The $36-million attraction, which can also be found at 
Universal Studios Florida, will be housed in a 60,000-square-foot sound stage. 
It will allow visitors to feel the sensation of traveling through the galaxy on 
airborne bicycles with E.T. as he searches for his home. 
</P>
<P>
Other additions include a "Back to the Future" special effects show, a new 
restaurant, an "E.T." toy store and a New England seacoast village.

P-I-E International Is Going Out of Business: The trucking firm that filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October will cease operations Dec. 29, 
laying off its 3,000 employees. P-I-E, a unit of Olympia Holding Corp. of Miami 
and a sister company of insolvent Transcon Lines of Los Angeles, said a 
bankruptcy trustee will be appointed to oversee its liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
The company cited the economy, fuel prices and adverse publicity associated 
with the Chapter 11 filing for its inability to continue operations. It also 
announced an agreement to sell its business to Intermodal Transportation 
Services Inc. of Downer's Grove, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Intermodal's parent is controlled by some of the same people who control 
Transcon Lines and P-I-E. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

WEISWASSER GETS A TOP POST AT ABC NETWORK

<TEXT>
<P>
Stephen A. Weiswasser, senior vice president and general counsel for Capital 
Cities/ABC Inc., has been named executive vice president of the ABC Television 
Network Group, one of the most senior positions at the network. He will report 
to John B. Sias, president of the ABC TV Network Group. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment thrusts Weiswasser, 50, into an operating post from the senior 
staff job he has held since 1986 and gives him a clear shot at running the 
Network Group when Sias retires next year. Network Group oversees the company's 
high-profile entertainment, news and sports divisions and last year accounted 
for 49% of Cap Cities/ABC's combined revenue.

As Cap Cities' top in-house lawyer, Weiswasser has spearheaded the network's 
campaign to overturn the financial interest and syndication rules and was the 
lead negotiator for the networks in private talks with Hollywood studios 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Sias said Weiswasser will "work in all areas of the Network Group," 
particularly on policy and operations, and eventually have some of the group's 
eight units reporting to him. He will continue to oversee the area for which he 
is currently responsible until a new general counsel is named.

<P>
The executive vice presidents at the Network Group are generally viewed as 
being groomed for bigger jobs. Other people who have held the post include 
Robert Iger, now president of ABC Entertainment in Hollywood, and Roger Werner, 
former president of all-sports cable network ESPN. JOHN LIPPMAN

CHRYSLER TRADING HECTIC AFTER KERKORIAN DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOS: SHARES IN THE NO. 3 CAR MAKER ROSE 62.5 CENTS. MEANWHILE, THE 
BILLIONAIRE INVESTOR TOLD THE SEC HIS PURCHASE WAS FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES.

<P>
Traders did a vigorous business in Chrysler Corp. shares Monday as billionaire 
investor Kirk Kerkorian, keeping all his options open, pondered his new 9.8% 
stake in the auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler led the most-active list on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at 
$12.875 a share, up 62.5 cents from the close Friday, the day Kerkorian's 
$272-million investment in the No. 3 auto maker was made public. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian's purchases were disclosed by Chrysler at the same time it announced 
that its board, in a special meeting, had tightened its anti-takeover measures 
to dilute the investor's holdings if he bought 10% or more of the company's 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
In a required filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Kerkorian reiterated that the purchase of 22 million Chrysler common shares by 
his Tracinda Corp. was "solely for the purpose of investment." 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian also said he had no plans to buy more shares of Chrysler. But he said 
that could change, depending on his "evaluation of the company's business and 
prospects." 
</P>
<P>
However, under provisions of the "poison pill" defense, even a small increase 
in Kerkorian's holdings would enable Chrysler to drastically dilute his stake 
by issuing new shares to all other shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC filing also said Kerkorian isn't proposing any "extraordinary corporate 
transaction" such as a merger or liquidation, shake-up in management, or other 
major changes. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian's Los Angeles attorney, Terry Christensen, said Kerkorian is "taking 
a few days off" and has no immediate plans for his Chrysler shares. Contrary to 
earlier indications, he also doesn't plan legal action against Chrysler's 
poison pill defense, Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't any next step," Christensen said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he criticized what he termed Chrysler's "significant over-reaction" in 
lowering the poison pill threshold to 10% from 20%. Christensen suggested the 
auto company should "straighten itself out" by revoking the anti-takeover 
amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chrysler officials said in response to questions Monday that the 
company has discussed other transactions with Kerkorian, including his possible 
purchase last year of its Gulfstream aircraft subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Looking to sell Gulfstream, Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca met with Kerkorian 
at the behest of Gulfstream Chairman Allen E. Paulson in the fall of 1989 to 
see if he was interested, a Chrysler spokesman said. Kerkorian, who controls 
MGM Grand Airlines, was approached because of his experience in the 
transportation business. 
</P>
<P>
Those discussions went nowhere, the spokesman said -- as did Kerkorian's query 
at the same meeting about Chrysler's interest in investing in MGM/UA 
Communications Corp., which he then owned. The entertainment business "was 
determined to be inappropriate for Chrysler as too far afield" from cars and 
trucks, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Gulfstream was sold to Paulson and others earlier this year for $825 million. 
</P>
<P>
In his 13-D filing with the SEC, Kerkorian detailed his purchase of Chrysler 
shares in 42 transactions starting Oct. 11, when the stock was priced at 
$10.50, and ending Dec. 12, when he bought his largest chunk of 6 million 
shares at $13.30 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Along with shares in General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., Chrysler's stock 
has been depressed for months. All three companies recorded modest gains Monday 
amid a general market decline as Kerkorian's investment focused attention on 
auto stocks. 
</P>
<P>
But automotive analyst Joseph S. Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Bros. said the 
muted market reaction to Kerkorian's investment in Chrysler means that Wall 
Street doesn't expect it to trigger a run-up in Chrysler's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
"The trading community is extremely skeptical," said Phillippi. 
</P>
<P>
Kerkorian said all the shares were bought with cash from the working capital of 
Tracinda, the investment company he owns. In November, Kerkorian walked away 
with $967 million from the sale of MGM/UA Communications to Pathe 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler officials said the SEC filing "was essentially what we expected."

CHRYSLER TO OFFER AIR BAGS ON ITS MINIVANS IN EARLY '91 
</P>

Chrysler Corp. said Monday that it would start equipping its minivans with 
optional driver-side air bags in February, becoming the first U.S. auto maker 
to offer the safety devices on the popular vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
For customers who don't want them, Chrysler will refund $500. 
</P>
<P>
From Feb. 1 to March 31, Chrysler will offer minivans with driver-side air 
bags. Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski said it hasn't been announced what will 
be done after that. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler could make the devices standard equipment, keep them as options or 
discontinue their availability. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company began an incentive program Monday with a $500 cash 
rebate offer for buyers of 1991 model Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager series 
minivans through the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
Through Dec. 10 of this year, Chrysler's minivan sales have dropped 4% from 
last year, to 346,944. Chrysler holds 43% of the minivan market. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler made driver-side air bags standard equipment starting with its 1990 
cars. General Motors Corp. makes them standard on about 15 car lines, while 
Ford Motor Co. puts driver-side air bags on its major lines, or about 1 million 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government, which requires automatic seat belts or air bags in cars 
being made today, will require passive restraint systems in light trucks by the 
1995 model year. Minivans fall under that category.

3. PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE TO ETHNICITY: CAN THE NATION-STATE SURVIVE?;

NOW THAT THE LID OF THE COLD WAR IS OFF, MANY ARTIFICIAL 'MELTING POTS' ARE 
BOILING OVER.

PRISTINA, YUGOSLAVIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a peaceable revolt. On a sultry Balkan summer day last July, 114 members 
of the provincial Parliament of Kosovo, enough to constitute a quorum, 
assembled in front of their offices in this shabby capital. Discovering they 
had been locked out of the building by higher-ranking authorities, the motley 
collection of farmers, peasants and local businessmen decided to vote in the 
open air. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot was unanimous: Tiny Kosovo, a land-locked and desperately poor 
province in the southeast corner of Yugoslavia, declared its independence. 
</P>
<P>
It was a case of one fragment breaking away from another fragment. Kosovo, with 
a population that is 90% ethnic Albanian, was rejecting domination by ethnic 
Serbs. They in turn are struggling against Yugoslavia's other major ethnic 
groups, the Croats and Slovenes. The divisions run so deep they could bring on 
civil war, but for members of Kosovo's Parliament, the overriding issue was not 
national unity but freedom to express their Albanian identity. 
</P>
<P>
"The Albanians, being a small people, want to preserve the traditions they 
have," declared Ibrahim Rugova, a wiry, intense literary critic and leader of 
Kosovo's Democratic Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
At one level, Kosovo's action simply reflects the increasingly dangerous 
conflicts among rival nationalities in a Balkan state that did not even exist 
until 1918, when it was fashioned from the rubble of World War I by the 
victorious Allies. 
</P>
<P>
At a deeper level, however, the vote in Pristina reflects powerful forces that 
are tearing at governmental institutions all around the world -- forces that 
may redraw the map of nations, usher in decades of new instability and pose 
difficult and unfamiliar challenges to even the strongest powers. 
</P>
<P>
From China to Czechoslovakia, from South Africa to the Soviet Union, political 
movements centered around ethnicity, national identity and religion are 
re-emerging to contest some of the most fundamental premises of modern 
statehood. In the process, they are reintroducing ancient sources of conflict 
so deeply submerged by the Cold War that they seemed almost to have vanished 
from history's equation. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, for example, Czechoslovakia was gripped by a struggle between 
liberal reformers and one of the most rigidly Stalinist governments in the 
Communist world. Today, the liberal reformers control Hradcany Castle, but 
ethnic tensions may split the country into two separate nations -- and the 
reformers themselves are divided over what to do. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought that ethnicities and nationalisms and all the other primordial 
loyalties would disappear as a result of modernization was premature," said 
Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a sociologist at the American University of Cairo, in 
assessing the post-Cold War era. "That was probably one of the big lessons of 
the 20th Century: Ideology is no substitute for interest or for geography. 
That's what we are rediscovering." 
</P>
<P>
And the implications of this resurgence of national, ethnic and religious 
passions are profound: 
</P>
<P>
* A host of modern nation-states are beginning to crumble because the concept 
of the "melting pot," the idea that diverse and even historically hostile 
peoples could readily be assimilated under larger political umbrellas in the 
name of modernization and progress, has failed them. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the strongest nations, including the United States, the task of such 
assimilation has proved difficult and the prognosis is for even greater tension 
in the decades ahead. 
</P>
<P>
* Turmoil in the Soviet Union and parts of China threaten to blow apart the 
last remnants of an imperial age that began more than 500 years ago. The 
turbulent dismantling of 19th Century European empires after World War II may 
be matched by new waves of disintegration within the Soviet and Chinese 
Communist empires, with incalculable consequences for the United States and 
other world powers. 
</P>
<P>
Stretching from the Gulf of Finland to the mountains of Tibet and beyond, the 
sheer scale of the potential instability would tax the world's capacity to 
respond. Ethnic unrest could spill into neighboring countries, old border 
disputes could reignite and, if the central governments tried to impose order 
with force, civil wars could erupt within two of the world's largest nuclear 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
* Around the globe, fundamentalist religious movements have entered the 
political arena in a direct challenge to one of the basic principles of the 
modern age: that governments and other civic institutions should be 
predominantly secular and religion confined to the private lives of individuals 
and groups. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Middle Ages, when religion dominated not only government 
but every other aspect of society, the pervasive trend in the past 500 years 
has been to separate church and state. Now, in many parts of the world, 
powerful movements are insisting on a return to God-centered government. 
</P>
<P>
One consequence of this trend is to make dealings between states and groups 
more rigid and volatile: As the United States has learned with the Arab-Israeli 
conflict and the Iranian revolution, disputes are far harder to manage when 
governments root their positions in religious principle. 
</P>
<P>
For the major powers, what all this is likely to mean is decades of the most 
demanding kinds of foreign policy challenges. After years of being able to deal 
with many problems in simple East-West terms, policy-makers must now struggle 
to understand a profusion of diverse but inter-connected peoples and issues, 
decide which are important and which can be ignored, then devise effective 
strategies for responding. 
</P>
<P>
And the challenge may be particularly difficult for the United States because, 
especially in such areas as religion and ethnic identity, Washington will be 
forced more and more to cope with problems that Americans have traditionally 
regarded as personal matters lying outside the realm of politics or foreign 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ETHNIC CONFLICTS REBORN 
</P>
<P>
There is no official demarcation line between Kosovo, one of Yugoslavia's two 
autonomous provinces, and Serbia, one of its six constituent republics. But the 
gulf separating them is evident all over Kosovo. Big red banners emblazoned 
with a black double-headed eagle, the Albanian flag, hang from the windows of 
shops and apartment blocks. Tall white minarets rise above rustic dwellings in 
what is now a Muslim stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
Here and there, anti-tank obstacles in the shape of small cement pyramids have 
been lined up beside the rough pavement in readiness for possible conflict. As 
cars pass, three children under the age of seven flash their fingers in a V, 
Kosovo's symbol for independence. 
</P>
<P>
But the feeling runs both ways. The day after Kosovo's Parliament declared it a 
separate republic, it was suspended by the Serbian government -- which has 
administrative authority over the police and other official institutions in 
Kosovo despite its nominal autonomy. Although they now account for only about 
10% of its population, Serbs regard Kosovo as "the cradle of the Serbian 
nation." They are determined not to lose their historical heartland. 
</P>
<P>
The roots of the conflict go back centuries. Orthodox monasteries dot Kosovo's 
craggy mountainsides, mute testimony to a time when the region was 
unquestionably Serbian. The Battle of Kosovo in 1389 still haunts the Serbian 
memory: The Ottoman Empire vanquished Serbia's armies and imposed a dominion 
that lasted for 500 years. 
</P>
<P>
When modern-day Yugoslavia was carved out of the remains of the Ottoman and 
Austro-Hungarian empires by the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, Serbia 
regained control of Kosovo, only to begin losing it again to a demographic tide 
of ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict between Serbs and ethnic Albanians is one of several divisions 
troubling Yugoslavia. Predominantly Catholic Croatia and Slovenia now demand 
autonomy. And the old quarrels are kept alive by present-day slights and 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent trip to Slovenia from Serbia, Predag Simic, director of the 
Institute of International Politics and Economics in Belgrade, was stopped by 
Slovene police six times in two days because his car had Serbian license 
plates. At local businesses, his checks on a Belgrade bank were not accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem really reaches very deep," sighed Franjo Tudjman, the burly 
president of the Croatian republic, who was twice imprisoned during the 
Communist era. During an election campaign stop in a Serbian stronghold inside 
his own republic last spring, someone tried to shoot him. 
</P>
<P>
Such things should not be surprising. The Treaty of Versailles bundled together 
five nationalities, four languages, three religions and two alphabets to create 
the Adriatic nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Having Yugoslavia was wrong to begin with," mused Veton Surroi, a young writer 
and president of the Yugoslav Democratic Initiative in Pristina. "It was an 
unnatural country." 
</P>
<P>
And, while Yugoslavia is sometimes dismissed as unique, the kinds of national 
and ethnic currents pulling it apart are battering many countries around the 
world. Of all the "isms" of the 20th Century -- or, indeed, the 18th and 19th 
centuries -- nationalism is among the most enduring. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of the melting pot and assimilation was part of the American 
imagination," said Firuz Kazemzadeh, a Yale historian. "It worked to some 
extent, imperfectly, in the United States. But it did not work in other parts 
of the world where assimilation was usually imposed by forces which were not 
acceptable to the masses of the people." 
</P>
<P>
In Eastern Europe, the unhappy marriage between Czechs and Slovaks threatens to 
break up; Bulgaria's Turkish population, long suppressed so ruthlessly that 
parents were forbidden to give their children Turkish names, is demanding 
freedom; and in Romania, ethnic nationalists clash with the Hungarian minority 
in hand-to-hand combat. 
</P>
<P>
In Africa, tribal hatreds that produced decades of slaughter continue unabated. 
</P>
<P>
In parts of South America, Indian and Mestizo and European-stock populations 
inhabit the same countries but live in different worlds with little hope of 
unity. Although Peru has been independent from Spain since 1824, "We are still 
not a nation," lamented Luis Bustamante, a Peruvian lawyer and politician. 
"Most Latin American countries are not yet nations." 
</P>
<P>
Across Central Asia, vast areas of the Soviet Union and China are torn by 
ethnic conflict. More than 1,000 people have already died in fighting among 
Kirghiz, Uzbek, Meshketian and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
In European Russia, Lithuanians, Latvians, Georgians and other national groups 
are asserting their independence as well. And if such tensions lead to the 
breakup of the Soviet empire, and parts of China as well, the result would be 
instability over a vast portion of the globe, with the possibility of many 
conflicts spilling beyond national borders. 
</P>
<P>
Even the West is plagued by both nationality and ethnic conflicts. In Canada, 
French Quebec threatened to secede if it was not given special status, while 
Mohawk and Cree Indians and Eskimos have confronted the government over 
millennia-old claims to ancestral lands. 
</P>
<P>
In Belgium, after 600 years, only an uneasy truce curbs the hostility between 
Dutch-speaking Flemings and French-speaking Walloons. The split has divided the 
country with such surgical precision that the ancient University of Louvain 
even divided the books in its library equally between two new, and separate, 
universities, a Flemish University of Louvain and a French Universite Leuven. 
</P>
<P>
France itself, where one of the world's most dominating cultures has absorbed 
centuries of newcomers by transforming them into Frenchmen, now struggles to 
digest new waves of Arab immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Especially in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and other areas subjected to 
colonialism, national boundaries often reflect decisions imposed from outside. 
The modern map of Africa was drawn by Europeans under the guidance of Belgium's 
King Leopold at the 1884 Conference of Berlin, for example, with total 
disregard to tribal lands and divisions. 
</P>
<P>
In the Middle East, much of the Arab world was divided into new nation-states 
by France and Britain in the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916, with limited 
recognition of sectarian, communal or religious divisions. The same is true for 
much of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"Not many nations around the world can claim to be genuine nations," asserted 
Luis Bernardo Honwana, Mozambique's minister of culture and noted African 
writer. 
</P>
<P>
"We not only have historically different national individualities," explained 
Croatia's President Tudjman. "We also have nations who belong to completely 
different civilizational and cultural spheres. Serbs belong to the Eastern 
Byzantine civilization. Croats and Slovenes belong to the Western Catholic 
civilization. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not by chance that this is the line where the Roman Empire split. 
Christianity split in the same place into Eastern Orthodox and Western 
Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
Why do people attach such profound importance to ethnic traditions seemingly so 
remote from the modern world? 
</P>
<P>
"What we are facing is the reaction of these groups against oblivion," 
Mozambique's Honwana believes. "In order to be part of an ensemble, of a group, 
one had to give up something, probably much more than one was prepared to give 
up. And one had to absorb some foreign, some strange values. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're trying to make sure that we are not destroyed as a cultural entity," 
he said. "Simply, unity cannot be built at the cost of the existence of some of 
the elements which are going to be part of this unity." 
</P>
<P>
"Mankind has known itself for 8,000 years, in terms of written history," 
reflected Tudjman. "During all that time, there have been great universalist 
ideas, civilizational, cosmopolitan efforts to create a unified world -- 
Christian, Islamic, Buddhist, even Communist. 
</P>
<P>
"But all of that is disappearing and what remains is man and his ethnic 
national community. It still exists today when the world is turning into a 
global village. And still the smallest national individualities claim a place 
in that world." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great task ahead to clarify what exactly a nation is, what its role 
is in modern liberal civilization, whether it has, in fact, meaning," said 
Daniel Kroupa, a political philosopher and member of Czechoslovakia's new 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that many states and societies are fragmenting over religion, 
ethnicity and national culture, their people nourish hopes of achieving 
economic progress by allying themselves with one or another of the new trade 
blocs now taking shape. Yet in many cases such dreams may be difficult to 
realize. Civil strife and dogmatic politics hold little enticement for foreign 
investors; bankers lend money to people whose first priority is money. 
</P>
<P>
But the future well-being of millions of people appears to depend on whether 
ways can be found to reconcile the potentially conflicting impulses toward 
political separatism and economic integration. 
</P>
<P>
As such tiny but thriving entities as Switzerland, Hong Kong and Singapore 
attest, large size is not a prerequisite for economic growth and prosperity. In 
the abstract, there may be no reason why Serbs, Croats, Czechs, Slovaks, 
Quebecois and English Canadians could not go their separate ways in peace and 
plenty. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, that is what many national and ethnic groups expect. "The next stage, 
they are liberated, they feel free. They will be able to make their choice," 
said Helmut Wagner, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"They will long for, they will pray for becoming part of a bigger union which 
they can accept freely and which gives them their autonomy in special areas, 
especially in language, culture and their own ways," he said. "This is as 
strong as the disintegration effort, to become a member of a bigger union." 
</P>
<P>
Again, Yugoslavia illustrates the hope. Even as the country hurtles toward 
disintegration, Croatia and Slovenia have opened independent offices in 
Brussels, seat of the European Community. "I would certainly prefer that the 
capital of Croatia be Brussels and not Belgrade," which lies in the Serbian 
republic, declared Dr. Zvonko Letrovic, a political science professor and 
member of the Croatian Social-Liberal Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the nations now torn by internal strife, however, qualifying for 
admission to something like the European Community may not be easy. Some of the 
fragments that result from the disintegration of existing states may have 
little to offer the large economic blocs or the global economy as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Equally hazardous, their focus on issues of religion and national and ethnic 
identity -- as well as the potential for continued strife, since hostile 
minorities are likely to remain inside most of them -- may itself be an 
impediment to the outside investment that is indispensable for economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
And West Germany's Wagner pinpointed the probable cost if successful liaisons 
are not made: "If you don't do that, you have to pay a price and the price is 
economic misery." 
</P>
<P>
Where such obstacles are overcome, analysts predict, the traditional 
nation-state may be replaced by new, still-undeveloped forms. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to find and create something new . . . structures as open as possible 
and as cooperative as possible," said Goertmaker, the German historian. 
</P>
<P>
"We see localization, villagization of the globe. But you also see an 
internationalization of the globe. The two trends are emerging side by side," 
said Ibrahim, the Egyptian sociologist. "The challenge for everybody is how to 
reconcile these two trends -- not stop either one, because they are 
nonstoppable." 
</P>
<P>
"How could I assert my local identity in food, in lifestyle, in dress, in 
feelings and so on and yet not be isolated or insulated or enclaved or 
marginalized or forgotten? That is the challenge now, and it will continue to 
be the challenge in the first two or three decades of the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TALES FROM THE TEMPLES 
</P>
<P>
Blowing rams horns, the band from the Temple Mount Faithful set out Oct. 8 on a 
symbolic march. A court order barred the 300 Israelis from bringing a three-ton 
cornerstone for a new Jewish temple anywhere near Jerusalem's most sacred 
square -- the site of two successive biblical-era Jewish temples, but, for the 
last 13 centuries, the preserve of two of Islam's holiest shrines. The 
Faithful, however, were determined to show that "the Temple Mount will not be 
silent until it is again the religious and national center of our people." 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, the ancient city witnessed its worst violence since the 1967 war: 
20 Palestinians killed and hundreds of Arabs and Israelis injured. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two days later, the tragedy was repeated in India. 
</P>
<P>
In Ayodhya, a holy city in the great basin of the sacred Ganges river, Hindus 
massed to build a temple at the birthplace of the god Rama. Villagers 
countrywide had baked bricks inscribed with the Lord Rama's name for a ceremony 
astrologers ordained most auspicious between 9:44 a.m. and 11:48 a.m. on Oct. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
For four centuries, however, the site has been occupied by a mosque. It is 
considered no less sacred by Muslims than by the Hindus. 
</P>
<P>
As in Israel, the government tried to preempt trouble. The ceremony was banned, 
a curfew imposed and 90,000 Hindus detained. Police surrounded the simple 
mosque. But, by day's end, the march had been attempted anyway and 20 were 
dead, hundreds wounded in violence that swept six Indian states. 
</P>
<P>
The tale of two temples reflects one of the most striking trends at the end of 
the 20th Century: In the world's most secular age, religion has emerged as a 
major political force. Vigorous and successful religion-based political 
movements are challenging the political status quo worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"With few exceptions, not since before the Age of Enlightenment has religion 
been so globally vital, energetic and ambitious," said Ehud Sprinzak, a 
political scientist at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. 
</P>
<P>
But politicized religions have less to do with changes among major faiths than 
with the contemporary political and cultural environment. 
</P>
<P>
The common denominator among disparate movements with diverse flash points, 
tactics and goals is a reaction against -- even a rejection of -- some of the 
most basic characteristics of the modern world. For millions of people in 
different parts of the world, the search for identity, security and fulfillment 
remains unquenched by the logic of the Age of Reason, by the universal rights 
promised by the Enlightenment or by the material progress of the scientific 
era. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a theological revolution, not that suddenly some philosopher came and 
demonstrated the existence of God that wasn't available before," said Rabbi 
David Hartman, a philosopher and director of Israel's Hartman Institute. 
Rather, he and other scholars suggested, it is a reaction against the 
predominantly secular quality of modern politics and public culture. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a reaction to the tendency of traditional values to be swept aside 
in periods of rapid change. 
</P>
<P>
"The worldwide upsurge in religion owes less to renewed piety than to the fact 
that religious institutions offer a familiar and psychologically comfortable 
alternative to the status quo elites and their politics," said the Peace 
Institute's Norton. 
</P>
<P>
Three prominent voices from three prominent religions echoed similar themes: 
</P>
<P>
Said Rachid Ghannouchi, a philosopher and founder of Tunisia's Islamic Tendency 
Movement: "Western thought is based on the principle that society can build a 
civilization without God. The slogans of development and nationalism and 
science were represented as substitutes for God. But this new God did not give 
happiness or stability to people. Science acknowledges that the human is so 
high and so wide, but it does not take into account man's depth." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Eliyakum Haetzni, a member of Israel's Knesset and a West Bank 
settler, reflected: "After we try to shed in this century all those things 
which have nothing to do with pure reasons, we found that pure reasons are 
something very sad, very empty." 
</P>
<P>
Added Gustavo Gutierrez, the founder of Catholicism's Liberation Theology: 
"Modernity was born with the affirmation of the individual as the beginning, as 
the basis of the social contract. But a mentality which has the individual as 
the absolute principle" does not fulfill the basic human needto believe that 
life is something more than just a process of survival. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all modern ideologies have divorced faith from government. Communism 
erased religion. Democracy privatized it. Even Zionism originally separated 
synagogue from state. 
</P>
<P>
Ideologies in countries with strong, single religious traditions -- Peronism in 
Catholic Argentina and Kamalism in Islamic Turkey -- either ignored or gave lip 
service to those traditions. Even apartheid, justified by South Africa's white 
Calvinist leaders with Old Testament quotations, is secular. 
</P>
<P>
And for substantial numbers of people, in varying degrees, each has failed. 
</P>
<P>
"The promises of modernity in its various forms -- whether an industrial 
consumer society or a classless society -- don't seem to have worked out," said 
Harvey Cox, a Harvard theologian. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all these terrible features all over, from atomic war to new 
diseases like AIDS to the fact that people in New York are sleeping, in the 
richest city in the world, on the streets," said Teddy Kollek, Jerusalem's 
legendary mayor. "The normal liberal attitude has not provided the answer." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of disillusionment or malaise, Hebrew University's Sprinzak added, 
"More people today are leaving ideology on the road to theology in search of 
political solutions to the miseries of our times." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, religion is a refuge of last resort; in countries where 
opposition is outlawed, the church, mosque, synogogue or temple provides an 
alternative to mobilize dissent. 
</P>
<P>
When most of South Africa's black leaders were exiled or imprisoned, Desmond 
Tutu, now the Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, led the anti-apartheid 
campaign; he won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize. Buddhist monks have spearheaded 
opposition to Chinese Communist control of Tibet; the Dalai Lama won the 1989 
Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, the Lutheran Gethsemane Church was the command center for 
public vigils and the pro-democracy movement before the fall of the Berlin 
Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"The (opposition) movement came out from the churches. I think it is quite 
impossible that (the revolution) would happen without the church," said Konrad 
Vekel, a member of New Forum during an interview after Sunday services at the 
19th-Century church. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, religion is an anchor at a time of turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"Modernity is like a violent tornado. When there's a tornado, what do people 
do? They go to the basement and cling to pillars," said Max Hernandez, a 
Peruvian psychiatrist and historian. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same with the current political transition. As the tornado sweeps 
through, people go to the basements of their soul and cling to the pillars -- 
things that have survived other political tornadoes, things like religion and 
ethnic roots." 
</P>
<P>
And in many corners of the globe, religion is not just challenging an existing 
order: It is defining the political spectrum where no clear consensus has 
existed. 
</P>
<P>
"In those countries in which the national struggle has not yet been completed, 
religion -- in the form of religious parties, extremist movements and religious 
leaders -- is going to be a major participant," said Sprinzak. 
</P>
<P>
But politicized religions add complex new dimensions to the political spectrum, 
as the 1979 Iranian revolution demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
Islam has since become a powerful player throughout the Middle East, testing 
all forms of government, often by violence but sometimes by democratic means. 
The Islamic Salvation Front swept the first multi-party elections in socialist 
Algeria's independent history in June. In the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, 
Muslims last year won 33 of the 80 parliamentary seats in the first elections 
since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere, however, is the challenge to the secular identity of the state more 
visible -- in scope or complexity -- than in India, the world's largest 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
This year, India was near war with Pakistan over Kashmir, where Muslims are 
fighting to secede. In Punjab, the death rate now averages 600 a month in 
violence over the Sikhs' demand for autonomy or, among extremists, secession. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue that sealed the fate of the last two governments is the hill in 
Ayodhya where Hindus want a temple for Lord Rama. When former Prime Minister 
Rajiv Gandhi allowed fundamentalist Hindus to lay a foundation stone for the 
temple last year, Muslims withdrew their support from his Congress Party. In 
last year's elections, Gandhi, whose party had ruled India all but two years 
since independence in 1947, lost. 
</P>
<P>
The same election marked the stunning rise of the Hindu fundamentalist 
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). With the temple issue as the centerpiece of its 
campaign in a country that is 82% Hindu, the BJP's seats in Parliament soared 
from two to 86. It became the third-largest party in India and the key member 
in the coalition succeeding Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
"The overall growth of the party can be attributed to the people's 
disillusionment that the other ideologies are not . . . able to deliver," 
explained BJP leader Lal Krishan Advani, who looks more like a soft-spoken 
grandfather than a fanatic. 
</P>
<P>
Advani claimed that the BJP is a "Hindu renaissance movement rather than a 
fundamentalist or revivalist movement" and that he himself only occasionally 
went to temple. 
</P>
<P>
But he then asserted: "I am against secularism. It has become a euphemism for 
covering up your allergy to Hinduism. Here's a party that does not shy away 
from the word Hindu." 
</P>
<P>
When police cracked down after a defiant Advani led a monthlong, 6,200-mile 
"chariot journey" across India to mobilize support for the new temple, Prime 
Minister V.P. Singh defended the action in a televised speech, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a question of saving the government, but of saving the country. This 
is the biggest challenge we have faced since the independence of the country. 
Religious fanaticism is the first step toward the foundation for a theocratic 
state. It will be the death of India as a secular state." 
</P>
<P>
It was not an overstatement. Three groups more extreme than the BJP now 
advocate a Hindu Raj or Hindutva, a Hindu nation-state. 
</P>
<P>
And after Advani's arrest, the crisis exploded. Despite the ban on the temple 
ceremony, thousands of youths, many wearing saffron headbands signifying the 
Hindu faith and shouting: "Hail the Lord Rama," broke through police 
barricades. Defying tear gas and rifle fire, they planted three saffron flags 
on the mosque's domes. 
</P>
<P>
With their leaders under arrest, militant BJP Hindus withdrew their support for 
the coalition. Singh's government collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, historians seriously doubt the site really was the birthplace of 
Lord Rama. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you prove this is the birthplace of Rama?" Advani said. "No, you can't. No 
one can prove it. The issue is not whether it is the birthplace of Rama. The 
issue is whether it is believed to be the birthplace of Rama. 
</P>
<P>
"This," he pronounced, "is a belief." 
</P>
<P>
Religious fanaticism is hardly new. The words thug, zealot and assassin are 
derived from ancient extremist movements within Hinduism, Judaism and Islam. 
But in modern times, religious issues have rarely had such grass-roots impact 
on political agendas, nor such global repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, what began as a religious march by 300 members of the Temple 
Mount Faithful resulted in two U.N. resolutions and a crisis so dramatic it 
threatened to shift world attention away from the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
And it offers a vivid example of how disputes rise to a higher plane when a 
religious component is added. 
</P>
<P>
For the Temple Mount Faithful, the issue is not just whether a small band of 
Jews should be allowed entry to an area. It is instead man's salvation. "We 
live now in an age which uses words like redemption and is a little ashamed to 
do so because it is a very logical age," explained Gershon Solomon, the 
Faithful's leader. "My struggle is not just for the physical site. We must make 
the Temple Mount as it was in the past, the religious, spiritual and national 
center of all the Israeli and Jewish people." 
</P>
<P>
Like Advani, Solomon, a white-haired scholar, said he is not a fundamentalist 
and only occasionally goes to synagogue. "Our movement is nationalist," he 
insisted, adding in the same breath: "Our coming back to the Temple Mount is 
the will of God." 
</P>
<P>
But in this case, fulfilling God's mission means replacing the two Islamic 
shrines where Mohammed is believed to have ascended into heaven to hear the 
word of God. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem, eventually, will only be divided on religious lines: conflict 
between Arabs and Jews and between Jews and Christians," Mayor Kollek 
predicted. "Nationalism will fade out, and it will remain a religious 
conflict." 
</P>
<P>
The shifting focus has already altered the longstanding political equations 
within the Arab and Israeli communities. While the Temple Mount Faithful is 
only a fringe group, Israel's religious parties have since 1984 gained 
sufficient clout to determine which of the country's two major political 
parties can form a coalition. 
</P>
<P>
But their support comes with demands, including bans on El Al flights on the 
Sabbath and movies on the Sabbath eve, as well as control of key government 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
As with India, the secular qualities of the Israeli state are eroding. 
</P>
<P>
Among Arabs, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two Islamic factions, have challenged 
both the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israelis since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The two Islamic parties differ deeply from the PLO on long-term goals. "The 
Islamic Resistance Movement considers that Palestine is inalienable Islamic 
land, assigned to Muslims until the end of time," the 40-page Hamas manifesto 
declares. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sprinzak, "Toward the end of the century, we find out that religious 
movements do not just want to participate in politics. They are fighting for 
ascendency, to take over. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to make it, but they will change the agenda. They've already 
changed the agenda, and they will change it more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

THE RUSH TO THE CITIES IS STRAINING THE SOCIAL FABRIC OF NATIONS

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PHOENIX SETTLEMENT, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ninety years ago, when Mohandas K. Gandhi established Phoenix Settlement on 
this fertile knoll, it was a rural commune sheltering a dozen families. 
Dedicated "to serve mankind," it grew its own crops, operated a clinic and 
published a newspaper preaching nonviolent resistance to discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy of Gandhi's 21 years of exile in South Africa lives on at the 
clinic. But what happened to the rest of Phoenix Settlement reflects the "urban 
revolution" now sweeping at least 120 of the world's 170 countries. 
</P>
<P>
Today, more than 10,000 squatters are crammed around the shells of 
now-abandoned buildings from Gandhi's era. They have come from rural and tribal 
homelands, in search of better jobs, better homes -- better just about 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they end up in homemade shacks of cardboard and plastic sheeting. 
Crates marked "Toyota spare parts" are favored building materials; their 
thickness better protects barefoot children from rain and biting winter winds. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix Settlement squatters are but a tiny fraction of the mass of humanity 
rolling into cities around the globe. In 1800, only 3% of the world's 
population lived in cities. In 1900, it was 10%. By the beginning of the 21st 
Century -- for the first time in history -- at least half the people of the 
world will be urbanized. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of that transformation, which is occurring at its most uncontrolled 
in Third World countries least able to handle it, is staggering -- on the 
people pouring into cities, on the cities themselves and on the nations of a 
world grown so interconnected that few will escape the shock waves from one of 
the greatest migrations in human experience. 
</P>
<P>
For the Third World, "this situation is going to produce a social disaster, 
increasing the level of illiteracy, downgrading public health, converting 
cities to slums and creating a social structure with a deep cleavage and a 
large percentage of marginalized people," warned Atilio Boron, an Argentine 
political economist. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among the consequences of runaway urbanization: 
</P>
<P>
* The economic and political fabric of countries is strained perhaps to the 
breaking point as national treasuries are drained without meeting even the 
minimal needs of urban migrants. Food production drops in rural areas and 
existing institutions collapse under the strain of unsupportable burdens. 
</P>
<P>
* As the public and private sectors fail to cope with millions of new 
residents, so-called "informal" institutions mushroom to deal with everything 
from jobs and housing to commerce and social services -- de facto 
states-within-states, all outside the control of government. 
</P>
<P>
* The rise of impoverished megacities, urban centers besieged by rings of 
teeming slums, sets the stage for explosive urban strife as the burgeoning 
fringe vies for limited resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Urbanization usually means housing problems, job problems, overcrowding, 
disease, social conflict," said Dr. Simon Baynham of Pretoria's Africa 
Institute. "As more and more impoverished people come in from the rural areas, 
they come into areas that are already limited in terms of the amount of land 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"So you've got fighting over land, fighting over housing, over influence in 
these areas." 
</P>
<P>
The developed world is not exempt. The populations of Los Angeles, New York, 
London and Moscow are all expected to top 10 million by the year 2000, while 
Tokyo-Yokohama will exceed 20 million. Advanced nations have far more resources 
available for dealing with such growth than poorer nations, however. 
</P>
<P>
Some countries are already facing nightmares -- intensified, ironically, by 
political and economic reforms. New freedoms stimulate urban migration even as 
they reduce governments' control over patterns of growth. 
</P>
<P>
In Turkey in 1983, for example, the end of military rule and the accompanying 
economic reforms triggered a rush to the cities -- and the rise of hundreds of 
gecekondus, or built-by-night suburbs. The fastest-growing area in Turkey is 
Sultanbeyli, a gecekondu outside Istanbul. In 1985, it was home to 3,741; today 
the population is 180,000. 
</P>
<P>
In China, which has the world's largest rural population and limits migration, 
new urbanization fervor has broken out since the end of forced programs that 
had sent millions of city dwellers into the countryside during the Cultural 
Revolution. By the end of this decade, up to 200 million Chinese -- equivalent 
to two-thirds of the U.S. population -- are expected to move to cities, 46 of 
which already have more than a million inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, the repeal of apartheid laws limiting black migration from 
rural areas is spawning an influx so massive that Johannesburg's Urban 
Foundation predicts all of that country's major cities will double in 
population in just the next 10 years. With as many as 7 million urban 
squatters, South African cities would have to construct 800 homes a day for the 
next 10 years just to resolve the housing crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the century of the great urban explosion," concluded a recent United 
Nations report. And, it said, "governments are discovering the impossibility of 
reversing urbanization -- or even of slowing it down." 
</P>
<P>
They are also discovering that when existing institutions -- public or private 
-- fail to meet the needs of urban migrants, the newcomers begin to develop 
their own, often-imperfect answers. The result: mushrooming growth of informal, 
ad hoc institutions that spring up to deal with human needs when governments 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
Greater Lima, now teeming with 7 million of Peru's 22 million people, is among 
the worst cases. Some 800 illegal slumlets ring the capital, including San Juan 
de Miraflores, a labyrinth of mud-brick and reed-thatch hovels, bleached 
colorless by the sun, in which the entire extent of government services is a 
single telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Destitute and all but officially abandoned by a debt-ridden government, Peru's 
squatters have started mobilizing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Lima, always alive with street vendors, is now a giant open-air market. On 
decrepit main roads, hawkers walk among speeding cars or near stoplights 
pushing hardware, magazines, fly swatters, cake covers, car fluid or any other 
new product or import. At Plaza dos Armes, the site of Lima's ornate 17th 
Century city hall, hundreds of street merchants offer fruit, underwear, toys 
and watches, each "business" neatly laid out on the sidewalk. Near one vendor, 
a child taps out tunes on empty Coke bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Once called the subsistence sector, such informal institutions are becoming 
among the most dynamic -- and volatile -- elements in Peruvian society. 
Analysts estimate that "informals" now account for 80% of all markets and bus 
transport in Lima and at least 40% of the capital's overall economic activity 
-- patterns mirrored throughout the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
"Many planners see the informal sector as probably the greatest source of new 
urban jobs in the next few decades and as an important safety valve to fill the 
gap created by inadequate city services," the World Resources Institute 
reported this year. 
</P>
<P>
Informals are creating vast networks of wholesalers, suppliers, service 
industries and even quasi-governments, everything from bus lines and small 
cooperatives to police forces dispensing informal justice. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the magnitude of economic problems, the informal sector is going to 
increase in importance and significance," said Yunus Carrim, a South African 
sociologist. 
</P>
<P>
In Mozambique, informal businesses in homes and garages make shoes, clothes, 
even car parts. "Our markets are now 50% informals. They began to develop in 
1983-84. They were doing a significant part of the nation's business by 1986," 
said Firminio Mucavele, a Maputo economist. 
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, the roads between Johannesburg and its black suburbs bustle 
with some 4,000 Toyota or Nissan mini-buses, all operated by informals. 
Informals even extend into the arms industry: there is the qwasha handgun, 
named for the sound it makes, as well as a rifle that takes standard-issue 
military ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
Informals account for at least 20% of South Africa's GNP, according to 
Johannesburg's Small Business Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But the hope of self-generated communities is matched by potentially 
self-destructive problems -- for the informals themselves and for the states. 
As Carrim warned: "It's going to become a much more strident feature of 
urbanization. It's going to be very difficult to have a controlled, orderly 
pattern" of development. 
</P>
<P>
One problem is declining food production. "All the expected growth in Latin 
America is going to be in urban settings. That means a decreasing percentage 
for feeding growing urban populations," said Eric Rodenburg of the World 
Resources Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that "none of the cities in the developing world can afford 
the infrastructure of mega-cities," the U.N. report said. Lima is expected to 
double in 14 years -- theoretically requiring a doubling of services. That is 
an impossible task for a city government unable to meet even the current 
demands for schools and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A third danger is political breakdown. "The fact that (informals are) growing 
usually is a commentary on the failure of the political system," said Jonathan 
Moyo, a Zimbabwe political scientist. "You can't tax them. You can't ensure 
standards in health." Nor does construction conform to building codes, 
schooling to basic curricula, or businesses to safety, sanitation or 
environmental standards. And homemade guns are not registered. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the process will play differently in different cities on different 
continents," said Francisco Sagasti, a World Bank forecaster, "it's clear that 
the future of cities around the world will be determined more by the 
overwhelming numbers coming in at the bottom than by the people who now run 
them at the top." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, left on the fringe, the informals' alienation and isolation could turn 
to instability and conflict. Squatter camps and informal suburbs worldwide are 
riddled with drugs, crime and prostitution. San Juan de Miraflores and other 
Lima slums, for instance, offer ripe recruits for Peru's Shining Path 
insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
Violence caused in part by the urban crunch is already part of daily life in 
informal slums from Argentina to Zimbabwe -- including Gandhi's beloved Phoenix 
Settlement. 
</P>
<P>
In many countries, the result may be that cities, traditionally centers of 
human and societal progress, will stagnate and decline under the rising burden 
of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"Dating back to Greek times, cities have been seen as places where people 
become 'urbane' and have access to the benefits of progress," Sagasti said. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the close of the 20th Century, the historic role of cities is now being 
compromised. They still offer the main means for upward mobility and 
modernization. . . . The problem is that cities are becoming massive ghettos of 
people confined in small spaces with little interaction with the rest of the 
city except through violence or illegal activities. The danger is that these 
ghettos will be institutionalized."

<P>
THE AIDS TOLL IS GROWING TOO LARGE TO IGNORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HARARE, Zimbabwe 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the epidemic an entire country tried to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Zimbabwe's minister of health appeared before Parliament to 
announce that infection with the human immunodeficiency virus did not 
necessarily lead to AIDS. He already had declared that the strain of AIDS 
prevalent in Zimbabwe was non-lethal. 
</P>
<P>
The government of Zimbabwe discouraged national testing for AIDS. Blood donors 
were not told if they were HIV-positive unless they asked. Ignorance was so 
prevalent that a rumor circulated in Harare this year that the cure for AIDS 
was raping a white woman. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the evidence became irrefutable. The number of confirmed AIDS cases in 
Zimbabwe jumped from 119 three years ago to 9,000 in September, with another 
12,500 people known to be HIV-positive. Even more chilling, an unpublished 
analysis by Zimbabwe's Central Statistical Office estimates that the nation's 
future population eventually will be halved by the epidemic, from a potential 
18 million in the year 2017 to only 8 million -- fewer than live in the country 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is symptomatic of the terrible toll that AIDS is expected to inflict 
in Africa and in other developing areas, ranging from Haiti to the Philippines. 
The impact, however, will not be limited to deaths. The crippling side effects 
could end up shaping the future of many nations far more than traditional 
social and political events will. In some hard-hit nations, AIDS could become 
the central issue of the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, AIDS is an issue of living or dying, of individual survival. Tomorrow, 
it may be an issue of nations surviving," said a European envoy in Harare. 
</P>
<P>
Since the most mobile segments of society tend to be the most vulnerable, 
groups pivotal to national security -- most notably the military -- could be 
ravaged. Officials in Zimbabwe acknowledge that up to 50% of the 46,000-man 
army is HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point down the road, this country may not be able to protect itself 
from an external threat," the European diplomat said. "More than half the army 
will have died off, and there won't be the manpower to replace them. That is 
going to be a big problem throughout this region among unstable or insecure 
countries that have tribal or other disputes, either at home or with neighbors. 
It opens up some hideous possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the epidemic will wreak havoc with already troubled economies in 
developing nations. Because AIDS is most widespread among the 20-to-45 age 
group, the most productive strata of societies will be decimated in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"The economic and social impact of a disease that kills people in their most 
productive years will be immense," said Dr. Michael H. Merson, director of the 
World Health Organization's AIDS program. "The selective impact on young and 
middle-aged adults, who include business and government workers as well as 
members of social, economic and political elites, could lead to economic and 
even political destabilization in some developing countries." 
</P>
<P>
The dying generation will in turn leave behind a generation of orphans, 
creating an enormous welfare strain. 
</P>
<P>
Since the cost of caring for AIDS patients in poor nations is prohibitive, any 
serious effort to take care of them will further drain national economies and 
set back development. In effect, African and other Third World countries are 
trapped in a no-win dilemma. If they use limited resources to treat people 
already condemned to die, they will have less for the education and development 
that are vital to both slowing the growth of AIDS and enabling countries to 
enter the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
But as Zimbabwe eventually acknowledged -- it replaced its health minister and 
launched its first anti-AIDS program -- it is a dilemma that can no longer be 
ignored.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ahmed Fakhr, a career military officer who risked his life for Egypt in three 
wars, sat back in his chair and paused. The words were clearly difficult. 
"Fifteen years ago, I used to tell my two boys, if you leave this country and 
go work abroad, you are betraying your national cause. Stay here. Develop 
Egypt. The government paid for your health care, for your education. Stay 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Fakhr sighed, then shrugged. "Today, I am preparing my two boys to emigrate," 
he said. "It's a question of the resources available, and the population." 
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, a country overwhelmed by a million new mouths every nine months, 
leaving has long been a response to an economy unable to keep up with an 
exploding population. But its desperation is reaching new heights, and similar 
despair is evident in many other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Like a global game of musical chairs, the world is witnessing the uprooting of 
tens of millions of people as factors once unique to countries like Egypt -- 
economic misery, uncontrolled growth and limited space -- spur an unprecedented 
human exodus. 
</P>
<P>
"This is likely to be the biggest movement of humanity in world history," said 
Doris Meissner, former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. "All corners of the globe will be affected, directly and because of 
the rippling-down effect." 
</P>
<P>
The list seems endless: Soviet Jews to Israel. Vietnamese to Hong Kong and Hong 
Kong Chinese to Australia, Bolivia, Canada, Belize or Singapore. Moroccans, 
Tunisians and Algerians to France, Spain and Italy. Burmese to Thailand; 
Mozambicans to Malawi. Afghans to Pakistan and Iran. East Europeans to West 
Europe. Filipinos and Gypsies to any place that will take them. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is hardly exempt. Although only a few of the vast numbers who 
want to emigrate there make it, the total still is enough to change the 
American complexion. In the 21st Century, white descendants of European 
settlers will become a minority -- reflecting the effects of immigration and 
higher birthrates among blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
The change in other countries will be just as dramatic. Birth control in the 
West and Japan is creating aging societies and shortages of younger laborers, 
while developing nations produce more people than they can ever hope to 
accommodate, further fueling emigration. 
</P>
<P>
But the two countervailing trends are unlikely to neatly cancel each other out. 
Indeed, the world's widening demographic imbalance and the momentous flow of 
humanity will be among the most divisive and destabilizing issues of the 21st 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration already is emerging as a powerful political issue, contributing to 
resurgent racism and nativism, providing a tempting target for right-wing 
movements and producing a sharper international division between North and 
South. 
</P>
<P>
Although it cannot be calibrated precisely, emigration appears to be growing 
exponentially. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past 10 years, since 1980, we've seen at least a doubling of the pool 
of people seeking access to other countries," said David Simcox, director of 
the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington. "And that's a conservative 
estimate." 
</P>
<P>
Many specialists predict that emigration could double again by 2000, especially 
with political upheavals worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet empire's possible collapse could trigger a massive exodus. More than 
500,000 Soviets left this year after exit permit requirements were scrapped; 
between 7 million and 20 million are expected to leave in the 1990s. One 
million have applied for U.S. residence -- more than the total number of Soviet 
emigres bound for all destinations since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, the anticipated end of apartheid has led thousands of whites 
to apply for the British citizenship of their ancestors. As Hong Kong nears the 
1997 transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China, 1,000 already are leaving 
weekly. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to home, 22% of Mexicans who participated in a 1989 Times Mirror poll 
said they were likely to move to the United States -- a figure comparable to 
the number of North Africans and East Europeans who would like to get into 
Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The new human wave underscores a shift from previous eras. In the postwar 
period, most emigrants sought refuge from political oppression or conflicts; 
today, the main motive is economic, often the byproduct of population growth. 
</P>
<P>
But doors are rapidly closing in front of them as the world runs out of 
inhabitable frontiers. Many industrialized nations no longer want the 
developing world's demographic overflow -- the largely unskilled workers once 
welcomed to foster industrialization. Australia and Canada, which once 
encouraged immigration, have begun to limit refugees and unskilled laborers, 
particularly Southeast Asians, in favor of skilled immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
And the asylum once offered to those living under totalitarian rule is being 
curtailed as ideologies like apartheid and communism are waning. Nicaraguans 
who fled the Somoza dictatorship in the 1970s or the Marxist Sandinista rule in 
the 1980s now want to escape the economic mess that was inherited -- and 
remains unsolved -- by Managua's new democracy. But no country is eager to take 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"For all the free flow of information, the tremendous flow of capital, the 
great mobility because of transportation, borders are more impenetrable than 
they've ever been for people," Meissner said. "It's a paradox between the 
rigidity of the state in physical terms and a world where everything else is 
opening up." 
</P>
<P>
In France, home to 4.5 million immigrants, Jean-Marie Le Pen's right-wing 
National Front has become a credible political force by calling for limits on 
immigration. Likewise, Italy's Lombard League, Austria's Freedom Party and 
Germany's neo-Nazi National Alternative Party are stimulating new waves of 
nativism through anti-immigration campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"The spillover of the demographic explosion is no longer going to be confined 
to the cantons and the bush," said Saad Eddin Ibrahim, an Egyptian sociologist. 
"The spillover will go north (to the developed world) and will create tension 
and the emergence of racism and all kinds of chauvinisms in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants already are feeling the pressures. Vietnamese in Czechoslovakia have 
complained publicly about increasing assaults and racial insults. Street 
protests erupted in Hong Kong against the government's policy of offering 
asylum to Vietnamese "boat people" -- despite their restriction to detention 
camps. And North Africans in France went on the rampage in a housing project in 
Lyon to protest police harassment of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the North-South fault line, tension over immigration is playing 
out between East and West. Once an escape route for East Bloc refugees, Austria 
has deployed army patrols along the border in response to domestic protests 
against an influx of Romanians seeking escape from economic hardships. It also 
reintroduced visa requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The wave of nativism is ironic, because some major political and economic 
powers are facing unprecedented population decreases and will need infusions of 
labor. Indeed, several European countries and Japan have birthrates so low they 
may be unable to maintain their economic superiority. 
</P>
<P>
Before reunification, West Germany's average birthrate was only 1.4 child per 
couple, well below the 2.1 average that sustains a population without growth. 
Italy's rate is only 1.3, lowest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Japan faces the same crisis. Its birthrate dropped from 3.1 per couple after 
World War II to 1.6 today. It also has the longest life expectancy -- and fewer 
workers to support an increasing population of pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
The developed world -- including Europe, North America and Japan -- accounts 
for 23% of the world population. By 2000, it will generate only 6% of world 
population growth. In contrast, Africa, which contains 12% of the world's 
people, will provide 23% of the growth by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the developed world, however, is reluctant to balance its population 
shortfall with new immigrants -- and the accompanying alien cultures, religions 
and higher birthrates that could erode the dominant social fabric. Rather than 
take more immigrants, France introduced welfare and tax incentives to existing 
citizens who have more children. Italy is attempting to lure emigrants back 
from Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Fakhr's sons -- Hossam, 31, and Haten, 33 -- are among the fortunate few 
who have options. Both are multilingual and college-educated; they have skills 
that open doors. Hossam is a U.N. translator; Haten has worked for U.S. 
companies in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
For others, the outlook is bleak. Fakhr, for one, predicts that efforts to 
erect legal barriers to new immigration in many countries will fuel resentment 
and possible strife. 
</P>
<P>
"The moment these people find that it's their survival," he said, " . . . 
they'll use violence and force."

EPILOGUE; 
</P>
<P>
ON ENTERING AN AGE OF PARADOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Start with the recognition that something profound has happened," said former 
Secretary of State George P. Shultz, reflecting on the changes sweeping the 
world. "This is a new epoch. That doesn't mean everything is different -- but 
it means all the important things are different." 
</P>
<P>
For five centuries, history seemed to move -- with frequent reverses and 
sidetracks, of course -- largely in one direction: toward a single, global 
civilization based on universal democracy, free trade and secular governance by 
increasingly powerful nation-states. 
</P>
<P>
But now history has bumped into new realities, from the revival of ethnic and 
religious fervor to the increasing obsolescence of the nation-state. Is this, 
as some have argued, the "end" of the historical progression? Is it a return to 
an earlier age, the game of nations of the centuries before the Cold War? Or is 
it a transition to a new path? 
</P>
<P>
We are still caught in midstream; our vision is still too close up. When 
Columbus returned home to Spain five centuries ago, he believed that he had 
found the Indies; it never occurred to him that he had, instead, found an 
entire hemisphere and helped invent the modern world. Like Columbus, we may 
need another decade or two of exploration before we know exactly where we are. 
</P>
<P>
The least that can be said is that we are entering an age of paradox: 
</P>
<P>
* A world that is becoming simultaneously more violent and less dangerous -- 
more warlike in some ways, more pacific in others. For every conflict resolved, 
from Berlin to Managua, a new one springs up to take its place. 
</P>
<P>
* A world in which the United States stands uncontested as a global leader -- 
the organizer and spearhead of a vast alliance in the Persian Gulf -- yet finds 
its power more circumscribed than at any time in a century. The real change has 
not been the historically common redistribution of power among a few big 
countries, but a wholesale diffusion of influence among countries, corporations 
and populist groups of many stripes. 
</P>
<P>
* A world in which nations still pursue power and wealth, but sometimes find 
that the best way to gain more power is to surrender some to others. Witness 
the nations of Western Europe that have found greater strength and influence 
than at any time since World War II by yielding sovereignty to the European 
Community. 
</P>
<P>
* A world in which the quest for new political freedom and the demands of 
economic competition push societies in two directions at once, integration and 
disintegration. Czechs and Slovaks, Kashmiris and Croats, all want some variant 
of the same paradoxical goal: political and cultural autonomy combined with a 
place in the global economy. 
</P>
<P>
* A world in which the standard of living of billions of people surges ahead, 
accompanied by a rising sense of dissatisfaction. From the new democracies of 
Eastern Europe and Latin America to the emerging economies of India and 
Thailand, people expect democracy to bring an approximation of the Western 
prosperity they see on their television screens. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to this new world of paradox, the 40-year-long Cold War was an era of 
unusual clarity: two superpowers, two economic systems, two competing creeds, 
each fully occupied with the overriding purpose of besting the other. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge facing President Bush and Americans today is more ambiguous. As a 
people, Americans like their foreign policy to join the national interest with 
solid principles. But how far can that be carried in such a fragmented and 
tumultuous world? 
</P>
<P>
Bush for one has insisted that the United States must continue its world 
leadership. And he has made gestures toward defining a new goal, especially in 
his speeches explaining the dispatch of U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia: "Out of 
these troubled times . . . a new world order can emerge . . . " he told 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
What the Administration has failed to do is develop a plan for achieving that 
new world order. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a strategic concept, and we aren't hearing one," said Paul H. Nitze, 
who helped draft President Harry S. Truman's strategies for containing 
communism. Last spring, the 83-year-old ex-Cold War warrior drafted another 
one, much as he had 43 years before. "The central theme the United States 
should support in the future is the accommodation and protection of diversity," 
he wrote -- "a world climate in which a large array of political groupings can 
emerge, each in its own individual, and perhaps eccentric, way." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it is Nitze's vision or something else, the objectives of a strategy 
for the decades ahead will be complex. One element must be preventing the 
outbreak of major wars. Another must be enhancing America's economic 
competitiveness. But the nation must do more than avoid military conflagration 
and make money. It must renew its own vision -- for the sake of its own people 
and for millions around the world who still look to America for evidence that 
ideals can be made real. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for something new -- organization, structure, concept," said 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former president of France. "What is strange is 
that, at the moment, there is no thinker who is suggesting a possible course." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, ironically, stems from America's success in winning the 
Cold War: It may be more difficult to unlearn old habits and remake old 
institutions in the wake of victory than in the face of defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime around 1985, in his third year as secretary of state, Shultz came to 
see that the world was changing in fundamental ways and asked his aides at the 
State Department to prepare a study. But the bureaucrats, adept as they were at 
examining immediate, specific problems, could not focus on the long range. 
"Everybody wanted to discuss the subject in terms of the treaties we had to 
negotiate," Shultz recalls, "but I said . . . 'That's not what I have in mind. 
I'd like to have somebody who's capable of thinking big and broad.' " 
</P>
<P>
Unable to delegate the task, the secretary of state, an economist and former 
university professor, did it himself -- "in my spare time," as he explained 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"My thesis was (that) the world is in a different age and it's an information 
age, and in order to flourish in such an age, people have to have a sense of 
freedom and openness," Shultz says. He realized that an opportunity might exist 
to influence the basic attitudes of a newly appointed Soviet leader, Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev. In a series of contacts with Soviet officials, Shultz tried to 
convince him that the Soviet Union could prosper only if it opened up its 
political and economic system. It was an effort that Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze later described as "very important" in the evolution of 
Soviet reform. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, deriving immediate policy from a comprehensive vision of the future is 
the exception, not the rule. Moreover, the way the government is organized 
often fragments policy-making. Economic policy, for instance, is often divided 
from political and diplomatic policy, even though -- especially in today's 
world -- the three should be closely coordinated. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the government's institutions have tried to change in response to the 
new realities. One year ago, the Central Intelligence Agency created a new 
division -- the "fifth directorate," to focus on global changes that fell 
between the cracks of traditional, region-by-region intelligence analysis. But 
one involved official observed: "We know how to watch, but we don't know how to 
get people (in the Administration) to pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
The transition from one era to another is never a simple affair. Historians 
cannot mark the point clearly on a calendar; they can only note the seismic 
events, like the collapse of the Berlin Wall or the invasion of Kuwait, which 
reveal that the terrain has changed. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the Middle Ages and the opening of the Modern Age began around the 
time of Columbus' first voyage in 1492, but it was two centuries before that 
transformation was complete. Even the birth of the Cold War in the ashes of 
World War II took more than two years. History is moving faster now, but its 
path is far from fixed. Many and various as the snares may be, there is still 
time for leadership to affect history's course -- for good or ill.

FAMILY'S WORRY ENDS; O.C. MAN HEADING HOME

The waiting and uncertainty ended Monday for one local family upon learning 
that Awni Younis, a 43-year-old businessman in Kuwait, had safely left the 
region and is heading home to his wife and children in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"This is amazing," said Younis' son, Abdullah. "We kept on waiting and waiting. 
I didn't expect him home until after Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Younis was one of the last people from Orange County known to remain in Kuwait 
since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion. At least four families have escaped since 
October, the most recent coming last week with the jubilant return to Fullerton 
of Michelle and John Richert. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve days ago, in what was viewed as a diplomatic attempt to head off war, 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced that he was freeing all remaining 
Westerners in his country and in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Younis told his family in an early morning phone call to Garden Grove on Monday 
that, after several false starts because of exit-visa problems, he had made it 
out of Bagdhad and was staying temporarily with relatives in Jordan. He planned 
to return to Orange County on the first available flight from Frankfurt, 
Germany -- by Thursday or Friday, he hoped. 
</P>
<P>
"He sounded good," said Younis' wife, Kazuko. "He said, 'I'm out of this mess.' 
He just wants to come home and have a nice Christmas and New Year's." 
</P>
<P>
Younis' wife, son and two daughters lived with him in hiding until October, 
when Hussein freed all women and children. Younis, a general manager at a 
trading company in Kuwait City, was then allowed to travel within the 
Iraq-Kuwait region for business and other matters but could not leave the area, 
his family said. 
</P>
<P>
A native of the Middle East, Younis told his family that he plans to travel to 
London at some point to tend to business affairs left behind in his quick exit 
from Kuwait. But in the meantime, he plans to spend his time in Garden Grove 
relaxing, watching some television and catching up on his reading, his wife 
said.

Marion Barry warned against the evils of drug use and proudly outlined his 
accomplishments as mayor during a farewell address to city workers. "We need to 
stop using cocaine and other illegal drugs," said Barry, who has admitted to 
alcoholism and addiction to two prescription drugs as well as occasional 
cocaine use. "I leave here with no regrets, but joy, and relief, quite frankly, 
that we can move on to a new life," the mayor said.

The judge in alleged New York mobster John Gotti's racketeering case postponed 
a bail hearing until Friday while he considered a prosecution request to play 
secretly recorded tapes in court. Prosecutors say the tapes show that Gotti is 
a threat to the community and should be held without bail. Gotti is accused of 
ordering the killing of Paul Costellano to take over as boss of the Gambino 
Family.

COUNCIL OKS PACT RAISING OFFICERS' PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday unanimously approved a one-year contract with the 
Tustin Police Officers Assn., giving officers a 6% salary increase. 
</P>
<P>
The contract will take effect Dec. 31 and will increase the salary range for 
officers to $2,951 to $3,587 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Union representatives had requested that the city include a modified workweek 
in the schedule, allowing officers to work four 10-hour days instead of five 
eight-hour days. But Royleen A. White, director of community and administrative 
services, said a city study showed that was not feasible. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point the city feels it can't afford it," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the union have already voted on the contract and representatives 
have signed it.

PANEL SAYS MAYOR VIOLATED STATE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laguna Niguel Mayor Patricia C. Bates violated state law but did no "public 
harm" when she chaired City Council meetings about a ridgeline-protection 
ordinance, according to a letter from the California Fair Political Practices 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was mailed to Laguna Niguel resident Eddie Rose, who lodged the 
complaint against Bates in October. Rose is a leader in the attempted recall of 
Bates and three other council members. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, dated Dec. 4, the commission said that although Bates abstained 
from the vote, she should not have chaired portions of meetings in September 
and October during which the ridgeline-protection initiative was discussed. 
However, it also says her participation was "nominal, involving only the 
orderly progression of the meeting" and did not warrant enforcement action. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would have prohibited development within 300 feet of ridges, 
preventing property owners from building on their lots in areas such as Bear 
Brand Ranch and Monarch Point. Bates owns a Monarch Point lot. 
</P>
<P>
Although residents gathered sufficient signatures for the measure, the council 
refused to pass it as law or put it to a citywide vote. City officials said it 
would open the way for lawsuits harming the city. 
</P>
<P>
According to the commission's letter, a public official is prohibited from 
participating in a "governmental decision in which he knows or has reason to 
know he has a financial interest." Chairing a council meeting "constitutes 
participation and is prohibited if the official has a conflict of interest," it 
says. 
</P>
<P>
When notified of the initial complaint, Bates said she had consulted with the 
city attorney before participating in the meetings. Since early November, the 
mayor has delegated the leadership of a meeting to another council member when 
she has had a possible conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
A commission spokeswoman said Monday that Bates had received a warning letter 
advising her of the violation. Bates could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rose said on Monday that he was "somewhat satisfied" with the response from the 
commission. LESLIE EARNEST

CITY MAY BE FACING $1.9-MILLION DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BILL BILLITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council heard Monday night that the troubled economy will result in a 
budget shortfall of about $1.9 million for the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
"We must do something about this very quickly," City Administrator Michael T. 
Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
He recommended that the council consider cutting the budget of each city 
department by 2% to 3%. The Police Department would be exempted from that 
proposal, but the department has been overspending and would have to meet its 
budget. Uberuaga said the Police Department currently is running about 4.5% 
over budget, or about $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg told the council that the department is 
already taking steps to deal with the shortfall, including cutting back on 
overtime, leaving existing positions unfilled and possibly ending the city's 
new experimental mounted patrol. That patrol started last summer, assigning two 
police sergeants and four police officers on horseback to patrol areas such as 
Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very successful program, and I'd like to keep it, but we may 
have to eliminate it because of budget considerations," Lowenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members were pessimistic about the city's finances for the rest of 
the fiscal year that ends June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We better start tightening our purse strings right now," said Councilman Don 
MacAllister. "I just came back from a trip back East, and the situation looks 
bad. Thousands of people are being laid off across the country. We're going to 
see less revenue (in city government) for next year than we received this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Uberuaga told the council that one stroke of good fortune could save the city 
from a financial disaster this year. He said the city will receive a 
$5.7-million refund from the state because of an overpayment into the city 
employees retirement fund. He said this could more than absorb the $1.9-million 
shortfall, but he urged the city not to rely on "a onetime windfall" to solve 
budget problems. BILL BILLITER

MIXING UP A BATCH OF JOB SKILLS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the bakery at Esperanza School is no Mrs. Field's Cookies, it is an 
industry of giant importance to the students who study there. 
</P>
<P>
At Esperanza, a special-education school, students with Down's syndrome and 
other developmental handicaps turn out chocolate chip cookies to learn job 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of this, I'm getting to work at Taco Bell," said Shannon Tierney, a 
19-year-old student as she helped package a batch. "I'm going to get a good 
job. It's nice to be able to work, and it's lots of fun." 
</P>
<P>
The 22 students, who range from 15 to 22 years old, work two days a week making 
the cookies, which are sold at Mission Viejo High School and at Los Alisos 
Intermediate School, and are given to various service groups. 
</P>
<P>
The students mix the batter, bake the cookies, package them in plastic bags, 
box them, clean up and then help deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
"Upon graduation, we want our students to be able to move straight into a job," 
Principal Ruby Edman said. "We want our students to be able to live as 
independent a lifestyle as possible. They want to have the gratification of 
working and being contributing members of society. They want the full-life 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
After working in the cookie-making program and taking other job-training 
courses, the students are assigned to one of 18 sites, including fast-food 
outlets, a clothing store and a hardware store, where they work without pay 
until graduation. Then, hopefully, they land paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The students "assemble the products, make the salsa, sweep the floors," said 
Joe Mbugua, manager of the Taco Bell where Tierney and others have received 
their outside training. "This has been very positive for them and us." 
</P>
<P>
Edman said that although today most people are open to the idea of training the 
developmentally disabled for jobs, that wasn't always the case. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came to Esperanza as principal 15 years ago, I remember people saying 
to me, 'Don't we spend a lot of money on training these people when we know 
they are never going to be able to pay society back?' I was stunned by the 
bluntness," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the program's graduates are paying back society, not only through income 
tax taken from their wages, but in other ways as well, Edman said. 
</P>
<P>
She told of one graduate with Down's syndrome who learned that the school was 
trying to raise money for a van. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought in $100 from what he was earning at Carl's Jr.," she said. "He said 
he wanted to help his friends." TERRY SPENCER

SCHOOLS TO ENFORCE STRICT SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning in January, smoking will be prohibited on all school campuses, 
including offices and football fields, in one of the most restrictive smoking 
bans in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Only the school district's maintenance yard in Laguna Canyon was exempted from 
the rule. 
</P>
<P>
To this point, teachers and staff members have been allowed to smoke in 
designated areas at each city school, Supt. Dennis Smith said. But the Laguna 
Beach school board voted unanimously last week to prohibit all campus smoking 
as of Jan. 7. Students were never allowed to smoke on campus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said there was virtually no opposition to the proposal, which the board 
began discussing about six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't the result of controversy," he said. "Everyone has agreed this is a 
positive move on the district's part." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Jim Kreder agreed that the prohibition was widely supported. 
"Our feedback from our teacher representative is that even those teachers who 
smoke supported the idea and have been very cooperative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the Ocean View school board in Huntington Beach banned smoking on 
all school district grounds, including the maintenance yard and transportation 
facility. That policy will become effective Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although other school districts have not banned smoking, according to an Orange 
County Department of Education official, the trend is in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're going to find that more school districts are going to be 
reviewing and looking at that potential," said Vicki Walker, a department 
spokeswoman. "It's a risk factor for the kids." LESLIE EARNEST

GUN DEATH MAY BE TIED TO DRUGS

<P>
The death of a 27-year-old man who was shot in the back Sunday night while 
trying to flee an altercation in a downtown alley may be related to illegal 
drug activity, Anaheim police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert A. Rosado of Anaheim died at 5:17 a.m. Monday at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said drugs were thought to be behind the altercation which 
led to the shooting, but he declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Police said witnesses reported seeing three men fighting about 7 p.m. Sunday in 
an alley in the 500 block of East Wilhelmina Street. The witnesses said one of 
the men, who was later identified by police as Rosado, attempted to run. As he 
did, one of the two suspects pulled a pistol and fired once, hitting Rosado in 
the back, police said. 
</P>

RAM FANS RUN INTO TROUBLE AT ANAHEIM STADIUM, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Snarled traffic and a few fender-benders accompanied the sellout crowd at 
Anaheim Stadium for the Los Angeles Rams' Monday night football game against 
the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was extremely congested for a long time," said Anaheim Police Lt. Ray 
Welch. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of late arrivals because of the traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Welch said the stadium parking filled to capacity, along with several nearby 
lots, forcing many spectators to park "a greater distance away" than during 
most Rams games. He said there were several vehicle mishaps, but no major 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Six additional officers were stationed in the stadium area to contend with the 
football traffic and rush-hour gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Richard Zschache said the extra officers were on duty to keep 
traffic moving. They were stationed at entry and exit points of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"When the stadium lots fill up, we get a lot of people trying to make turns 
from the middle lane of traffic when they see a parking space," Zschache said. 
"We are prepared for that." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, police were advising motorists to steer clear of the 
stadium-area freeways and streets before game time if travel wasn't necessary. 
Traffic began to build up about 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like other Monday night games," Zschache said. "There are more cars 
on the road because people are leaving work to come to the game and don't have 
time to go home and pick up their friends."

NEWPORT MUSEUM IN COURT OVER NEA OATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Attorneys for the Newport Harbor Art Museum and the Bella Lewitzky Dance 
Foundation asked a federal judge Monday to declare unconstitutional the 
National Endowment for the Arts' anti-obscenity oath. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys argued that the controversial NEA provision, which required arts 
groups applying for 1990 grants to certify the content of art or dance works 
when applying for federal grants, places a "potential chill" upon free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the vagueness of the anti-obscenity stipulation -- its lack of 
clear-cut standards and procedural safeguards -- violate the arts groups' right 
to due process of law, the attorneys argued. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is not only the anti-obscenity provision, which has been dropped for 
1991 grantees, but also two grants totaling $172,000 to the Newport museum and 
the dance company that were awarded but not distributed to the groups because 
they refused to sign the provision. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge John G. Davies declined to make an immediate decision about 
granting a summary judgment in the case. 
</P>
<P>
James V. Selna, a Newport Harbor trustee and an attorney with O'Melveny &amp; 
Myers, which is representing the museum, said he expects a ruling in a week or 
10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in response to protests over federal support for a few controversial 
art exhibits, new legislation required 1990 recipients of NEA grants to sign an 
agreement that they produce or exhibit no "obscene" work. No grant money is 
being released to recipients unless they sign. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor was to receive a total of $100,000 for three separate grants, 
and the Lewitzky Foundation was awarded a $72,000 grant. NEA funding represents 
slightly more than 5% of the museum's $1.8-million operating budget this year 
and about 8.5% of the dance company's budget of about $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Newport Harbor became the third arts organization -- and first 
museum -- in the country to file a lawsuit seeking a court order barring the 
obscenity certification. The Lewitzky Foundation filed a similar brief in July. 
On Oct. 23, the court denied an NEA motion to dismiss the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 19, the museum submitted a request for funds for three of the 
exhibitions covered by the grants, but with a paragraph stating its 
noncompliance with the obscenity certification.

Re the "Europe Braces for Hungry Hordes" Commentary Dec. 3: I'd like to commend 
Robert Hunter for his concern and insight into the plight of Soviet and East 
European refugees and citizens. 
</P>
<P>
With the breakdown of the Soviet economy and the opening of Eastern Europe, 
Western European nations are facing the very serious possibility of 
ever-increasing floods of migrant workers and refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Since World War II, the United States has consistently fought for the growth of 
democracy and human freedom throughout the world. Now that most of Eastern 
Europe has taken that first step, is the United States going to "blink" in its 
commitment to help them reach their goals? Is the U.S. going to allow these 
people to starve before they have a chance to enjoy the fruits of democracy? 
</P>
<P>
It's time to show the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe some "openness" of our 
own and to assure them of our continuing commitment to human life and 
democracy.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: MELODY EARLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School: Estancia High School 
</P>
<P>
Sport: Basketball 
</P>
<P>
Position: Guard 
</P>
<P>
Class: Senior 
</P>
<P>
Even Torrance's box-and-one defense designed to stop Earle couldn't slow her 
down. Earle, a 5-foot-9 point guard, moved inside and had nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
She set picks for teammates, ran around picks to get open and scored 23 points 
to lead the Eagles to a 68-55 victory in the championship game of the Beverly 
Hills tournament. Earle, who was named the tournament's most valuable player, 
scored 22 points in an 83-30 victory over El Segundo and 24 points in a 70-36 
victory over South Torrance. Earle, who is averaging 8.4 assists, is in her 
third season as a starter for Estancia. Earle's all-round ability is one of the 
reasons the Eagles, who are 7-0 this season, have started so well. 
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
Erika Miller, who made nine three-pointers, one shy of the Southern Section 
single-game record, and scored 43 points in Edison's 73-32 victory over Los 
Amigos. 
</P>
<P>
Stacy Thurber, who scored three goals for Sunny Hills in a 6-1 victory over 
Foothill and two in a 6-1 victory over Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Jinelle Williams, who was named most valuable player of the Brea-Olinda 
tournament after leading Brea-Olinda to the tournament title. In three games, 
Williams averaged 22 points.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: INJURY LEADS OKURA TO HER FUTURE CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When doctors talk about performing major reconstructive knee surgery, most 
athletes begin to think their sports careers could be over. 
</P>
<P>
But for Kristen Okura, a Saddleback College basketball player, such surgery 
turned into on-the-job training for her future career. 
</P>
<P>
Okura, a 5-foot-10 forward, had once considered becoming a lawyer. But because 
of the work she put into coming back from her knee injury, she is now 
interested in physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
She hurt her right knee in a scramble for a loose ball in a game at Riverside 
last January. Okura, from Mission Viejo High School, was expected back within a 
couple of weeks. But after the swelling went down, it was clear the extent of 
the damage called for an operation. She would not play again that season. 
</P>
<P>
With Okura, who averaged 17 points and 10 rebounds, in the lineup, Saddleback 
was 10-8. Without her, the Gauchos went 3-8. 
</P>
<P>
After surgery, Okura hobbled into her second-semester classes on crutches. 
Among her classes for the spring semester was one in sports medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"There I was the first day, the perfect model for when we studied the knee," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Okura also spent a lot of time that semester at a rehabilitation center near 
campus, where she now has a part-time job. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I'm going to aim for now," Okura said of a career in athletic 
injuries. "There are a lot of different things I can work on." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, her favorite project is herself. 
</P>
<P>
Okura spends more than an hour getting her legs (her left knee also bothers 
her) and two fingers taped before practices and games. 
</P>
<P>
She has learned to tape herself in case the home team doesn't have a trainer 
present when Saddleback is on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Saddleback trainers) say that I'm using up all their tape," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Before her injury, Okura led Saddleback in scoring and rebounding last season. 
This season she is again near the top and Saddleback is 8-3. Okura is averaging 
nine points and seven rebounds despite jammed fingers and soreness in both 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
Though she has bounced back from surgery sooner than expected, she isn't 
pleased with her play this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been frustrated this season at times," Okura said. "I still don't think 
my rhythm is back, but I'm getting better. The injury taught me patience, which 
is not my middle name. It wasn't in my vocabulary." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden West women's basketball team is off to another good start this 
season. The defending state champion Rustlers are 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West won its sixth in a row Saturday -- a 70-58 victory over Cuesta in 
the championship game of the Cuesta tournament. Golden West started sluggishly 
in the title game and trailed, 20-16, with about five minutes left in the first 
half. The Rustlers then scored 16 consecutive points and lead at halftime, 
34-22. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the sixth consecutive time Golden West has won this tournament. 
Bits Sirchia, a sophomore guard from Golden West, was selected the tournament's 
most valuable player. This season, Golden West also has won its tournament and 
finished third in the College of the Sequoias tournament. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Rustlers should find stiffer competition once the Orange Empire 
Conference season begins Jan. 3. Fullerton (10-2), Saddleback (8-3) and Orange 
Coast (9-5) are playing well, and Rancho Santiago (5-9) and Cypress (1-11) have 
struggled. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress (9-5) is the only men's basketball team in a tournament this week. The 
Chargers play Snow College of Utah on Thursday in the first round of the Dixie 
tournament in St. George, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament concludes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago (13-1) won the annual Pasadena tournament for the second 
consecutive year Friday. The Dons, who are the top-ranked team in the state, 
defeated Ventura, 78-66, in the title game.

Price Cuts: Toshiba America Information Systems Inc. said Monday that it is 
cutting prices on two lines of laptop computers to stay competitive in the 
crowded market. 
</P>
<P>
The company's Irvine-based Computer Systems Division said it will reduce prices 
on six portable computers by $300 to $1,200 to improve its market position. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Charlton, computer analyst for Dataquest, a market research firm in San 
Jose, said he is not surprised at Toshiba's price cuts. 
</P>
<P>
He said other firms, such as AST Research and Advanced Logic Research, both of 
Irvine, have recently introduced low-priced machines aimed at taking some of 
Toshiba's 26% share of the estimated $5.4-billion U.S. market for portable 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
Charlton said he expects other players to enter the laptop market in the next 
six months, including a long-awaited model from International Business Machines 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
IBM isn't commenting on the rumors, but analysts expect the giant computer 
company to announce its own model in the first quarter of next year.

AST Stock Sold: Two of AST's founders are selling a small chunk of their 
holdings in the Irvine personal computer company. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas C. Yuen, AST's co-chairman and chief operating officer, recently sold 
10,000 shares of the company's stock at $27 a share for a total of $270,000. 
</P>
<P>
Yuen still owns 1,669,536 shares of stock. 
</P>
<P>
Safi U. Qureshey, co-chairman and chief executive, filed to sell 20,000 shares 
of AST stock at an unspecified price on Dec. 7. He still owns 1,931,336 shares. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Don, an AST spokesman, said the sales were routine actions in which 
company officers exercised their rights under a stock option plan. 
</P>
<P>
AST stock has risen sharply over the past several months. It closed Monday at 
$26.50, off 87.5 cents a share, in over-the-counter trading.

YULETIDE TIPTOES INTO LITTLE SAIGON; 
</P>
<P>
RETAIL: HOLIDAY GIFT-BUYERS ARE SCARCE IN THE COUNTY'S LARGEST ASIAN SHOPPING 
DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was a slow day for Santa. 
</P>
<P>
He waited patiently on a Saturday afternoon for a child to perch on his knee, 
whisper a few gift wishes and sit still for a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
But there were few takers at the Asian Garden Mall in the heart of Little 
Saigon. Santa sat idly, ignored by the men seated at a long line of tables 
playing an Asian board game that looked something like checkers. 
</P>
<P>
As he ho-ho-hoed his way to his red velvet throne behind an illuminated plastic 
snowman, Santa admitted that even if business picks up, he might have a little 
trouble understanding the Christmas dreams of some children. Santa, as it 
turned out, is a Latino who doesn't speak Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas has come to Little Saigon. But don't look for giant candy canes and 
garlands draping street lamps along the bustling commercial strip that is 
centered along Bolsa Avenue in Westminster. And forget about long lines at cash 
registers or shopping-weary customers sinking under the weight of presents. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County's most prominent Asian shopping district, the yule season is a 
more elusive creature. Many Vietnamese are Buddhist and do not observe 
Christmas as a religious holiday. Vietnamese Catholics celebrate Christmas, but 
the economic downturn has forced many to cut back on holiday gift-buying. 
</P>
<P>
"Shopping this year is not as strong" because of the weaker economy, said Dr. 
Co Dang Long Pham, president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. Some shop 
owners are hoping for business to pick up as the Chinese Lunar New Year 
celebration -- the biggest holiday for many Asians -- begins Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it's beginning to look a bit like Christmas in Little Saigon. 
Christmas carols, sung in Vietnamese, blare into the parking lot of the Vinh 
Quang Gift Shop, where tables bulge with inexpensive imported model planes and 
baby dolls. Smiling counter workers wear Santa caps at the Song Long French 
&amp; Vietnamese bakery. And Hong Phuc Dim Sum to Go has painted its windows 
with wintry scenes and a cheery "Happy Holidays" message. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Wynn, who operates a seasonal toy business under a blue canvas tent in 
the parking lot of Today Plaza, said her customers -- primarily Vietnamese with 
a smattering of Koreans and Anglos -- tend to spend $50 or $100 in one shot. 
</P>
<P>
"They do it all in one trip," she said as she tended store with her brother, 
niece and son. Like other shopkeepers, Wynn said business had been slow, 
although it perked up last week. 
</P>
<P>
Tuyet Tran, owner of the Au Printemps clothing store, said her sales have been 
among the lowest she can recall in a holiday season. Tran has owned the store 
for 10 years in the busy Bolsa Mini Mall, a pink, U-shaped cluster of about 40 
shops. She blamed the same economic downturn and war jitters that have cut into 
the profits of stores at other county malls. 
</P>
<P>
Customers are still coming to the store, but they are buying smaller items and 
spending less, Tran said.

Binh Nguyen and his wife, Hien, of Westminster were shopping for toys for their 
2-year-old son at Vinh Quang's parking lot sale. Nguyen said he prefers to buy 
clothes at shopping malls but looks for items such as toys in Little Saigon 
because the small shops and bustling atmosphere remind him of the Vietnam he 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more like my country," he says with a hint of pride. 
</P>
<P>
He explained that his wife is Catholic and that the family celebrates 
Christmas. But he said the extravagant gift-giving that has become a mainstay 
of American culture contrasts with Vietnamese tradition.

O.C. DESIGN FIRM TAKES COMPUTERS OUT OF THEIR BOXES 
</P>

<P>
For Doug Patton, president of Patton Design Enterprises in Costa Mesa, one of 
the most frustrating tasks is trying to talk computer manufacturers into 
creating something more than a plain "box" when building a personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
Patton's firm has served as a design consultant to Apple Computer Inc. since 
May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, his company has generated more than 100 designs -- with 
plenty of what company designer Rick Jung calls "soft curves and sensuous 
crowns" -- for a series of low-cost computers Apple launched in October. 
</P>
<P>
More than a half-dozen firms competed to develop the new look for Apple, each 
of them designing three different concepts known as Papa Bear, Mama Bear and 
Baby Bear. The final version of the work was called Goldilocks. 
</P>
<P>
"We let our imagination loose on the project," he said. "It was very exciting 
trying to come up with a vision of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Patton said he worked 12 to 15 hours a day on the project, which represented 
his firm's first big consulting contract. Only a portion of Patton's designs 
were incorporated into the showcase Mac Classic computer, Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
But if Patton gets his way, the computers of the future will be designed like 
sculptures, as pleasing to look at as they are to operate. 
</P>
<P>
"People are beginning to realize that there has to be an emotive quality, 
something that makes you feel good about the work, something more human and 
exciting in the design of a computer," Patton said.

JOSEPH N. BELL: A TALE OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS OFFERS A LESSON TO MIDDLE CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I came face to face with the scooter today. I couldn't avoid it. I had to get 
out the Christmas decorations that were boxed in the deep recesses of our 
garage. And when I dug my way back to them, there it was, forlorn and 
despairing. One wheel on and one wheel off. 
</P>
<P>
His mother and I had given it to my stepson for Christmas four years ago. Or 
was it five? He rode it a few times and then blew a tire. It wasn't the kind of 
scooter I remembered from my own boyhood, the kind we made sometimes with a 
piece of board and discarded wheels. This one had brakes and balloon tires. And 
one of the tires blew out. 
</P>
<P>
My stepson asked me if I would fix it, and I said, "Sure," and put it in the 
garage, out in the open where I would see it every day. After about six months, 
I took off the wheel with the blown tire. And that was it. 
</P>
<P>
The wheel rested on my work bench -- an oxymoron if ever there was one -- for a 
while, then got moved to a remote shelf, then to a remoter shelf. Same thing 
with the scooter; it got put farther and farther out of sight. I don't know 
where the bolts are now that hold the wheel on. 
</P>
<P>
So today I found the scooter and had to deal with my guilt. My stepson asked 
about it several times early on, then went on to other things -- of which he 
has an ample supply. I was defensive -- "been so busy I just haven't been able 
to get to it" -- and then the inquiries stopped and the guilt receded and the 
scooter disappeared from our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at it today made me face some other unfinished business in the garage. 
In even deeper recesses are an electric train and a pool table. The electric 
train is from six years ago, the pool table probably a year later. My wife 
bought the train, badly overestimating both my skills and my persistence. I got 
it to run in a kind of half-baked fashion, but never properly. The engine kept 
jumping the track, and in an effort to fix that, I jimmied the track so the car 
wouldn't run at all. So out to the garage, to the shelves, to the dark 
recesses. 
</P>
<P>
The pool table was a little different matter. There was no room for it in the 
house, so we set it up in the garage where my stepson and his friends used it 
in a desultory fashion for a few months, then it was just in the way. I 
stumbled over it whenever I was working in the garage, so I pushed it to the 
side and finally took off the legs and stored it. No one objected. 
</P>
<P>
I have a feeling there's a disassembled aquarium back there too. It lasted 
about a year and had to be cleaned constantly -- or should have been -- and 
fish kept dying in it. This was no fish bowl. It had machinery and temperature 
gauges and other devices I never quite understood. It's in pieces, too, taken 
apart gratefully when the last fish -- a very tough customer -- finally died. 
</P>
<P>
So today, instead of brushing it aside as I usually do, I looked straight on at 
all this largess and allowed it to speak to me. It said two things loud and 
clear: we fall into conspicuous consumption in our comfortable middle- and 
upper-middle-class environments so easily that we never stop to examine the 
validity of it. And we get ourselves tied up with work and life stresses so 
inextricably that we don't allow ourselves time to smell roses. Or fix 
scooters. 
</P>
<P>
I could have fixed that scooter. I wouldn't have done it easily -- I don't do 
such things easily -- but I could have done it. I would have required time and 
energy and attention, and I seemed to be in short supply on all three counts 
when it came to scooters. So it didn't get fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuous consumption is a more pervasive problem, a disease of the haves in 
this Orange County society that is being split ever more sharply between the 
haves and the have-nots. I'm as guilty as the next guy, even though I can still 
remember quite vividly a period in my life when a single present at Christmas 
time was the norm. It's a big mistake to look back at the Depression as the 
good old days, and yet there were some real virtues. I learned the value of a 
single, loving, hard-to-come-by Christmas present. I didn't feel discriminated 
against. And that single present sure as hell didn't end up buried in the 
garage while it still had life in it. 
</P>
<P>
It would be easy to blame greedy kids for all this, but that isn't fair at all. 
Our kids are the products of their times, their social condition, and their 
environment. . . . If their friend next door gets a pair of $200 shoe skates, 
then pretty soon every kid in the neighborhood has them. 
</P>
<P>
This is the way we live, and this is the climate our children reflect. God help 
them if they ever find themselves in a situation where they have no money for 
necessities, let alone exotic shoe skates. I suppose most of them are tough 
enough to survive, but it will be a lot more painful than it would have been 
had the elders in their lives controlled consumption more than we have. 
</P>
<P>
I don't fight this any more. That also takes time and energy -- and it makes me 
feel like a brontosaurus. Maybe the scooter and train and pool table were small 
protests on my part. You don't have the scooter, then use the bike with all its 
expensive accessories or the overpriced shoe skates. You want to shoot pool? Go 
rent some movies instead, or get out your Nintendo games. 
</P>
<P>
But that's probably just an excuse for my own laziness and dereliction of duty 
in not repairing those toys -- or getting them repaired. Maybe I allowed them 
back into my life today because I was ready to do something about them. 
</P>
<P>
They will be removed from their hiding places. And they will be fixed. Our 
stepson has long since outgrown them, so they will be put in hands that will 
love and cherish and enjoy them. If we can't make such decisions at 
Christmastime, then there would seem to be no hope at all.

<TEXT>
<P>
Description: White overall with black crown, nape and eyeline. The bill is 
orangish-yellow with black tip; legs are also orangish-yellow. Black feathers 
edging wings are predominant in flight. 
</P>
<P>
Tail is short and deeply forked. This is the smallest North American tern. 
Length: 9 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Prefers open, flat beaches and shallow water of rivers and lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Aquatic insects, shrimp, small fish and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Male flies with fish in bill, chased upwards by several terns, then 
glides down; courtship feeding. Hovers and defecates over intruders. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Unlined depression scraped in sand or dirt, just deep enough to keep eggs 
from rolling away. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Olive-buffed with dark brown markings, 1.2 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
Call: A short kip, or a harsh chir-ee-eep. Terns lack song, but the calls serve 
varied functions in mate calling and warning of predators. Mates recognized by 
call. 
</P>
<P>
Notes: Currently protected by the Endangered Species Act, the Least Tern was 
close to extinction by the early 1900s when the plume industry claimed up to 
100,000 terns during a single season.

A SPECIAL 'THANKS' TO THOSE WHO CARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph Bell's column in the Nov. 11 View focused on Hershell Hardimon, a man 
who collects and distributes food for the needy. This is Hardimon's response to 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to express a big "thank you" to each of the people who helped me 
so much with donations of food, clothes and cash. There are no words to express 
my gratitude and appreciation, but I am going to try. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks so much to: 
</P>
<P>
* Beacon Bay Enterprises for allowing me to collect donations here. 
</P>
<P>
* All my customers for their support and understanding when I left you stranded 
in the shoeshine chair to accept donations. 
</P>
<P>
* All the new faces and business people who left their card and said, "call me, 
let me know what you need. I want to help." 
</P>
<P>
* All my beautiful "seniors" who are so special to me. 
</P>
<P>
* My personal "doughnut man." 
</P>
<P>
* Rams football players who took their holiday time to stop by and help. 
</P>
<P>
A super thanks to Joe Bell and Mark Boster from The Times (Orange County 
Edition). Also to Matt Stevens and the crew from KCAL-Channel 9. 
</P>
<P>
Without all of them, a lot of you beautiful people would never have known about 
my dream of helping. 
</P>
<P>
A very special "thank you" to Vons supermarket of Woodbridge, because without 
their support we could never have accomplished so much. 
</P>
<P>
All of us working and giving together made this Thanksgiving very special for 
so many homeless and less fortunate families. I only wish each of you could 
have been with my wife and me to see the smiles of the little ones and the 
sparkle of hope in the eyes of the adults. 
</P>
<P>
I realize that the holidays are a special time. However, hunger and poverty do 
not have a special season, and, with your continued support, we can make all 
year a little easier and happier for so many. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to leave you with a thought that my family and I try to live by: 
"God never gives you a dream or challenge without giving you the strength and 
resources to carry it out." Each of you are my strength and resource He has 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
God bless each of you and yours. 
</P>
<P>
Call me or stop by if you would like to help, or if you know of someone who 
could use a little help. Together we're a GREAT team.

SOME DRUG-EXPOSED INFANTS GO UNDETECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because not every baby is tested for drugs at birth and some do not initially 
show signs of drug exposure, it is impossible to say how many drug babies are 
actually born in Orange County each year. 
</P>
<P>
One study -- based on a survey returned by 19 of 28 Orange County hospitals -- 
estimated that 1,248 drug babies were born here last year. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine remains the most frequently detected drug, followed by 
methamphetamines, according to the study by Coordination of Resources to 
Infants for Better Services (CRIBS), an interagency coordinating council. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Harris, program analyst for the Orange County Social Services Agency, 
believes that the 1,248 figure is conservative. 
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals are not legally mandated to report a positive toxicology screen, so 
we've always felt there was just a percentage that came to our attention," said 
Harris, who estimates that only 20% to 25% of drug babies in the county are 
referred to Social Services' Child Abuse Registry. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Harris said, Social Services was involved with 24 cases of newborns 
who tested positive for drug exposure. The number, for unknown reasons, had 
dropped from an average of about 25 a month to 22 a month in previous months. 
</P>
<P>
To get a better idea of how many drug-addicted babies are being born in Orange 
County, blind drug testing in 26 county hospitals was conducted during an 
unannounced seven-day period this fall. Results of the confidential study, 
co-sponsored by the March of Dimes, public health agencies and UCI Medical 
Center, will not be made public for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Milford, assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at UCI Medical 
Center, said most babies exposed to opiates such as heroine and methadone go 
through physiological withdrawals. But babies exposed to stimulants such as 
cocaine and amphetamines may have tremors, feeding problems or sleeping 
problems and don't go through a life-threatening withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of drug-exposed babies, she said, "probably are not going to 
show any significant difficulties like retardation. We don't know in terms of 
the more subtle things like behavior problems or mild learning disabilities. 
Nobody's been able to follow them that far yet, but those studies are in 
progress right now, of which we are one." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said some hospitals either have no protocol or they have varying 
policies for testing drug babies. "Or, they might test a baby and determine 
that things otherwise look OK," she said. "The hospital and the (mother's) 
doctor make the decision whether or not to test and what to do once they have 
tested." 
</P>
<P>
The test, she noted, only detects drugs that the mother has ingested in the 
last few days, "so there's a lot of room for variation in how things are 
handled. The mother may have explanations they think feasible" for why drugs 
were detected. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said that if Social Services is called by a hospital, a social worker 
will talk to hospital personnel and the baby's parents to determine whether the 
baby would be at risk for abuse or neglect if he went home. 
</P>
<P>
As required by law, Harris said, an emphasis is placed on trying to keep the 
mother and baby together if at all possible in order to maintain the 
parent-child relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said that if the parents are cooperative and it is determined that 
intervention will reduce the risk of abuse or neglect to the baby, the services 
of a social worker are offered to the parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally," she said, "that consists of having a social worker making monthly 
visits to the family, helping them find different resources in the community 
they might need and helping the parent find drug treatment -- whatever might be 
called for." 
</P>
<P>
The condition of the baby is also part of the decision-making process, said 
Harris. "It's difficult when we don't see all the symptoms right away, because 
then everyone is left not sure of what special needs the child will have." 
</P>
<P>
If it is determined that the baby would be at risk even with all available 
services to the parents, the social worker would ask for a legal order to 
prevent the hospital from releasing the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said that any time Social Services places a hold on a baby, a detention 
hearing will be scheduled within 48 hours. "If we wish to continue protective 
custody, we must file a petition" with juvenile court to give Social Services 
legal authority in the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said three things can then happen: "The court can dismiss our petition, 
they can return the baby to the parents and order us to supervise, or they can 
order the baby to be placed in foster care." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said the Social Services Agency for years has been encouraging hospitals 
to make reports of substance-exposed babies "so we could assess the situation." 
</P>
<P>
But Harris believes that recently passed state legislation, the Perinatal 
Substance Abuse Act, may have a negative impact on the number of drug babies 
reported to the Child Abuse Registry. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation says that a positive toxicology screen at the time of delivery 
of an infant is not in and of itself a sufficient basis for reporting child 
abuse or neglect. It goes on to say that hospitals shall not report babies who 
have a positive toxicology screen unless other risk factors are identified. 
</P>
<P>
"So it places the responsibility of doing a more in-depth assesment -- of the 
mother's situation, of the child's special-care needs and the risk of neglect 
or abuse of the child -- on the hospital personnel," said Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that if hospitals had been already spending the time to consider all 
the circumstances that it (the legislation) should not make any difference. But 
I'm concerned that other hospitals will not have the time or the interest to 
work with families on this and, as a result, they simply will not receive any 
services." DENNIS McLELLAN

SPECIAL REPORT: SEEKING A NEW WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
AN AGE OF CHALLENGE AND MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The ending of the Cold War has plunged the globe into a period of rapid and 
pervasive change. As old tyrannies and antagonisms dissolve, new freedoms and 
opportunities blossom. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is a paradox. New tensions are rising, seemingly rushing to fill a 
vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's special edition of World Report examined two challenges to the 
post-Cold War world: how the ability to wield economic power, through control 
of technology and markets, will determine who leads the industrialized world; 
and how democracy, even in its hour of triumph, faces untold new pressures 
around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
This week, World Report explores the powerful forces that are now challenging 
the dominant cultural and sociopolitical trends of the 20th Century: explosive 
ethnic and national movements that contest some of the most fundamental 
premises of modern statehood; vibrant religious movements that deny the 
"truths" of the secular age; and the spread of weaponry that alters the very 
concept of "superpower." 
</P>
<P>
It looks to the death of the world's last empires, and the birth of a 
post-modern age of challenge and mystery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shifting Realities in Global Power 
</P>
<P>
War: What happens when ancient ethnic feuds go modern with chemical arms and 
other high-tech weaponry? 
</P>
<P>
Religion: Who determines God's will when fervent, well-armed men disagree? 
</P>
<P>
Society: What's the future of chaotic megacities in which squatters outnumber 
residents? 
</P>
<P>
Geopolitics: How do spheres of influence change when the Third World can 
suddenly target the First with long-range missiles? 
</P>
<P>
Peace: Can the world find unity when so many of its peoples want to divide?

European Community foreign ministers today ruled out a meeting with Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz on the Persian Gulf crisis unless he first sits 
down with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
But they seemed to leave open the possibility of a change of policy if 
Washington and Baghdad stay deadlocked as a Jan. 15 deadline nears for U.S.-led 
military action in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The ministers scrapped a meeting between Aziz and the Community's Italian 
presidency in Rome Thursday because Aziz did not go to Washington on Monday to 
meet with Bush and discuss Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
(In Washington, President Bush said his efforts to arrange direct talks with 
Iraq had stalled but vowed he was more determined than ever to enforce a U.N. 
mandate that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait. "I guess I'm about where I was a couple 
of weeks ago when I made that proposal," Bush told reporters when asked to 
quantify whether he was now closer to a war in the Persian Gulf.) 
</P>
<P>
The Aziz visit to Washington was called off because of a wrangle over the dates 
of a return visit to Baghdad by Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
Washington rejected Saddam's proposal for a meeting on Jan. 12, saying it was 
too close to the U.N. deadline and would not give Iraq enough time to withdraw 
from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in a Turkish television interview released 
today in Ankara, said, "There is no need for us to go to Washington if Bush is 
to repeat to us the U.N. Security Council resolutions." The resolutions call 
for the complete withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats named Britain and the Netherlands as among countries strongly 
opposing talks with Aziz and said several ministers argued against any change 
in policy at today's meeting. They quoted Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens 
as saying any change would be premature. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said the ministers left unclear whether their decision might be 
reviewed if efforts failed to resolve the Persian Gulf conflict peacefully.

Blood tests confirmed that 12 people who died during a religious ceremony led 
by a self-styled spiritualist suffered carbon monoxide poisoning, Baja 
California police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Blood samples from three of the victims revealed lethal levels of 
carboxyhemoglobin, which carried carbon monoxide rather than oxygen to the 
victims' organs, said Miguel Pallares, a forensic chemist with the Baja 
California state police. 
</P>
<P>
"The tests showed high enough levels to kill these people, Pallares said.

Baja California Assistant Atty. Gen. Victor Vazquez Fernandez also said tissue

toxic substance as first suspected, the official news agency Notimex reported.

The republics of Moldova and Uzbekistan today delivered a powerful double blow 
to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plans to save the Soviet Union from 
breaking up. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Moldovan delegates stalked out of the Congress of Peoples' 
Deputies, the national legislature, while Uzbek President Islam Karimov lashed 
Moscow for what he called decades of mismanagement and exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he wants Soviet citizens to vote this winter in a referendum on 
whether to sign a unity pact. 
</P>
<P>
"I introduced a suggestion to hold a referendum, and those who don't want a 
union, let them go and secede," Gorbachev told reporters in the Parliament 
building's lobby. But he reiterated his demand that any secession must take 
place within the framework of Soviet law. "It's a divorce process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan delegates said they were furious the Kremlin was ignoring their 
call for a crackdown on the southwestern republic's breakaway ethnic 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are leaving for good," Moldovan Deputy Dumitru Matkovsky told reporters 
outside the hall, saying only a few Russian-speaking deputies had remained 
inside for the second day of debate on Gorbachev's state-of-the-union address. 
</P>
<P>
He said Moldova would not sign Gorbachev's planned new Union Treaty, designed 
to redefine relations between the central government and the 15 increasingly 
rebellious republics and restore some order to the crisis-ridden country. 
</P>
<P>
Matkovsky said Moscow had interfered in Moldova's internal affairs by 
encouraging the republic's separatists. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not being allowed to sort out our sovereignty by ourselves. We won't 
sign the Union Treaty. There is no chance of that now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Karimov raised the specter of a powerful Central Asian coalition against the 
treaty when he echoed criticisms of the document made by the head of 
neighboring Kazakhstan. 
</P>
<P>
"The center should not limit the rights of the republics but it should be the 
other way around. . . . We support Kazakhstan on this point," Karimov said. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Estonia, meanwhile, rejected Gorbachev's plan for a referendum 
on the union treaty.

DAILY NEWS SUES UNIONS OVER VIOLENCE

The Daily News has sued its striking unions on charges they have used violence 
to disrupt the publication and sale of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The News on Monday, in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, 
accused the unions of violating federal labor law. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second lawsuit brought by the newspaper against the unions since the 
strike began Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The first lawsuit, brought Nov. 29 under the civil racketeering statute, 
accused the nine striking unions of coordinating a violent conspiracy to force 
a favorable labor settlement or the sale of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The new complaint claims that the unions violated the Labor-Management 
Relations Act, which prohibits unions from interfering with the business of 
parties not involved in a labor dispute, in this case News' dealers and 
advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit asks for more than $50 million in losses the News claims it 
incurred as a result of the campaign, which it said included "many hundreds" of 
incidents of arson, assault, vandalism, threats and harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Kheel, a labor attorney and adviser to the unions, denied the 
allegations. He cited recent testimony by senior police officials who said 
investigations found that the violence was committed by individuals and was not 
part of a coordinated conspiracy.

U.S. EASES ITS BAN AGAINST RACE-BASED AID

<P>
The Education Department today backed away from a total ban on financial aid 
targeted for minorities. It said colleges and universities will be allowed to 
award scholarships based solely on race as long as federal funds are not used. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary Michael Williams, who heads the department's Office of 
Civil Rights, announced a six-point policy regarding race-exclusive 
scholarships at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the new policy should "prevent disruption to the efforts of 
colleges and universities to attract minorities to their campuses and to 
reassure students that no scholarships that have already been awarded . . . 
will be affected in any way." 
</P>
<P>
Central to the policy is the Education Department's decision to let 
universities that receive federal funds administer scholarships funded entirely 
by private persons or organizations where the donor restricts eligibility for 
the scholarships to minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Under past Administration policy, public and private universities could set 
aside public or private funds for scholarships targeted to minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, public schools will be able to offer only non-federally 
funded scholarships for minorities. Private schools that receive federal funds 
will be prohibited from offering any scholarships based on race. 
</P>
<P>
There are no restrictions on scholarships offered by private schools that 
accept no federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Most minority scholarship programs already are privately funded. 
</P>
<P>
The policy announced today is less restrictive than a proposal made last week 
by Williams under which schools would have been barred from administering any 
scholarships based solely on race. 
</P>
<P>
The department also said: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Universities will have four years to review their programs under Title Six 
of the Civil Rights Act and to assure that students do not suffer from the 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- During the four-year transition period, the Administration will investigate 
any complaints it receives but it will not make a broad review of whether 
schools are complying with the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Administration will encourage state legislatures, local governments and 
private universities receiving federal funds to review the legal restrictions 
on minority scholarships. The goal of the reviews will be to ensure that 
minorities and other needy students get the maximum possible amount of 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush called Williams on Monday to discuss his concerns, said an 
Education Department source who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
In early drafts of the ruling that was announced today, Williams had wanted 
merely to soften the department's decision by giving colleges two years to 
comply. But that relaxation was dropped in favor of a complete retreat. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that 
Bush was "very disturbed" about Williams' decision. The President ordered a 
quick review with advice from lawyers in the White House and the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Williams acknowledged last week that he had not consulted with anyone at the 
White House before issuing the ruling.

Japan has rejected U.S. demands to allow more foreign lawyers to practice here, 
a Justice Ministry official told reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the end of two days of talks between U.S. government 
representatives and officials from Japan's justice and foreign ministries. 
</P>
<P>
Japan rejected U.S. requests to allow foreign lawyers to employ or form 
partnerships with Japanese lawyers in Japan, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be difficult for U.S. lawyers to employ or enter into partnerships 
with Japanese lawyers because the two countries have very different legal 
systems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign law firms, previously banned from Japan, gained limited entry under a 
1987 law allowing them to advise Japanese clients. But the law banned them from 
practicing Japanese law and employing or forming partnerships with Japanese 
lawyers.

U.S. District Judge Ralph Thompson sentenced former football player John Green,

Dallas to 18 months.

The judge also ordered Monday that the two be supervised for three years after 
release and receive drug treatment.

Thompson, serving time in a Texas federal prison after pleading guilty in 
April, 1989, to a cocaine conspiracy charge, testified during the two

Green and Harris.

KIAM JUGGLING PIECES TO REASSEMBLE PATRIOTS;

Sam Jankovich may be coming, Pat Sullivan may be staying and New England 
Patriots Coach Rod Rust says he doesn't worry if he's going. 
</P>
<P>
They are the pieces in the puzzle Victor Kiam is trying to put together to get 
the team he owns out of its current mess. 
</P>
<P>
Kiam wants Jankovich, athletic director at the University of Miami, to become 
the Patriots' director of operations. Sullivan, whose contract as general 
manager runs through 1996, could stay on in a reduced role. The three are 
scheduled to meet in New York today. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the next step is for Pat Sullivan to sit down with Jankovich and find 
out if they can work together," according to a source quoted in today's Boston 
Globe. "Once that is done, the deal should be done fairly quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the Boston Herald reported Jankovich might try to persuade Hurricanes 
Coach Dennis Erickson to join him in trying to rebuild the Patriots. Erickson 
and Jankovich have been together both at Montana State and Washington State 
before their latest teaming at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Rust has three years left on his four-year contract. The Patriots are 1-13 in 
his first season after losing their 12th consecutive game last Saturday, 25-10, 
to the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
Rust, 62, said Monday he doesn't let speculation about his future affect the 
way he does his job. 
</P>
<P>
"Career-wise and job-wise I came to peace with all that stuff many years ago," 
he said. "Having done that, (the speculation) really has a very minimal effect 
on how I go about my daily chores." 
</P>
<P>
Kiam has talked with Jankovich about giving Jankovich total control over club 
operations, including the power to hire a new coach, the Globe reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Herald reported Monday that Kiam had offered Jankovich $3.5 million 
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
"Sam hasn't demanded that Pat be fired, but he has told Victor Kiam he would 
like to start with a clean slate," the Herald quoted a source close to 
Jankovich as saying. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining six years on Sullivan's contract are worth $2.7 million, the 
Herald said. The contract says he can't be fired unless certain provisions are 
violated; none have been, the paper added.

Six cities and prospective ownership groups, including three from Florida, were 
chosen today as finalists for two National League expansion teams. 
</P>
<P>
The NL's "short list" is composed of Buffalo, Denver, Miami, Orlando, St. 
Petersburg-Tampa and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminated were Nashville, Tenn., Charlotte, N.C., Phoenix and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The league has said two new teams will begin play in the 1993 season with final 
selection of the franchises expected before the end of next September. 
</P>
<P>
Cubs reliever Mitch Williams, who struggled through the 1990 season after 
saving 36 games in 1989, said he wants out of Chicago after the club signed 
free-agent reliever Dave Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"They signed Dave so they could get rid of me," Williams said Monday in a 
telephone interview from his Arlington, Tex., home. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't care for the things I've heard about (Manager) Don Zimmer talking 
behind my back. There's no question now that I want out of Chicago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Daiei Co., Japan's largest supermarket chain, today denied a U.S. news 
report that its owner was trying to buy a stake in the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report from New York last Saturday quoted unspecified 
documents as saying that Daiei Chairman Isao Nakauchi was considering buying a 
9.6% stake in the Yankees.

Ivan Lendl scored a surprise victory over Stefan Edberg today when the 
International Tennis Federation named him its men's world champion for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf was named women's world champion for the fourth year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Although Edberg ends the year as world-ranked No. 1, the ITF said it gave the 
title to Lendl, who is ranked third, because of his consistent form in the four 
Grand Slam tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
The Swede's first-round loss in the Grand Slam Cup last week also weighed 
against him, the ITF said. 
</P>
<P>
Both players matched each other for Grand Slam triumphs, Lendl taking the 
Australian Open title and Edberg winning at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
But the ITF nominating panel of former champions Fred Perry, Frank Sedgeman and 
Tony Trabert, said Lendl, who missed the French Open to concentrate on 
preparing on grass for Wimbledon, was more consistent overall. 
</P>
<P>
He won 16 matches in three Grand Slam events while Edberg won 13 in four. 
Although Edberg finished second in Australia, he was beaten in the first round 
at both the French and U.S. Opens.

Author Salman Rushdie, who recently emerged from nearly two years of hiding 
over Iran's order that he be killed for blasphemy, said today that he hopes to 
rebuild his bridges to the Muslim community and live a more normal life. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm trying to do is seize back bits of my life," Rushdie said in an 
interview on ABC's "Good Morning America" program. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian-born writer emerged from hiding Dec. 5, signing copies of his new 
book at a north London bookshop. He went underground in February, 1989, when 
Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini ordered him put to death for allegedly blaspheming 
Islam with his book, "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
Iran's Islamic Culture and Guidance Minister Mohammed Khatami renewed the 
sentence this month, and an Iranian charity said it would pay $1 million to 
anyone who kills Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie said he has been contacting Muslim leaders in Britain and elsewhere to 
resolve what he called "this terrible misunderstanding" and was encouraged by 
the conversations.

COMEDY CHANNEL, HA! TO MERGE;

CABLE TV: THE COMBINED EFFORT, WHICH WILL GO INTO EFFECT EARLY NEXT YEAR, WILL

Two all-comedy cable services that have battled each other since April Fool's 
Day said today they are ending their war of the chuckles and merging into a 
single cable network called Comedy TV. 
</P>
<P>
Home Box Office's The Comedy Channel, begun in November, 1989, and MTV 
Networks' HA! The Comedy Network, on the air since April 1, will start their 
merged service early next year, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Each is a 24-hour operation, and each has faced difficulties getting onto cable 
systems due to a shortage of available channels. 
</P>
<P>
They made it official less than than a month after two proposed rival cable 
services devoted to law -- In Court and American Courtroom Network -- also said 
they would merge into one service called American Courtroom Network. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner Inc., which had hoped to launch one of the all-law networks, owns 
HBO. 
</P>
<P>
The Comedy Channel is seen in 8.5 million homes. HA!, whose parent company is 
owned by Viacom International Inc., is in 6.5 million homes. Their union will 
give the new service 15 million homes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
All-sports ESPN serves the most cable homes, 55.9 million, followed by Turner's 
Cable News Network, which serves 54.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The advertiser-supported Comedy TV Network that will result from HA! and The 
Comedy Channel will be a 50-50 venture, with a programming lineup drawn from 
each network, the two companies said. 
</P>
<P>
Each network will continue its respective operations until the new service 
begins "in early 1991," HBO said. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the new network will be recruited from outside the two 
companies, and the new network will be staffed by HA! and The Comedy Channel 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
HBO Chairman Michael Fuchs, in a statement, said the merged comedy service "is 
not only a very positive move for both companies, but should have a salutary 
effect on the cable industry as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
About 12 new cable services plan start-ups in coming months, according to Erica 
Gruen, a cable analyst at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising.

'OLD-TIMERS' STILL BRING IN THE RATINGS;

TELEVISION: SINATRA, HOPE AND BALL MAKE THE TOP 30. NBC WINS NIELSENS FOR THE

NBC won the ratings race last week, with "Cheers" leading the list. But Frank 
Sinatra was up there in the top 20, and Bob Hope and Lucille Ball made the top 
30. 
</P>
<P>
CBS aired Sinatra's 75th birthday bash in its Sunday night movie slot, and it 
tied for 15th, a decided winner in the time period. The ABC Sunday movie, "The 
Witches of Eastwick," tied for 30th, while NBC's Sunday entry, "Back to the 
Future," tied for 49th. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hope's Christmas Special from Bermuda came in 22nd, winning its time period 
for NBC with better-than-usual time period numbers. 
</P>
<P>
CBS reran its "I Love Lucy Christmas Special," which tied for 30th with 
"Witches." Another old-timer, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" on CBS, tied for 
36th. 
</P>
<P>
The older generation was flexing its muscles on Tuesday, the only night on 
which NBC has an older-skewing audience. The network scored its biggest Tuesday 
win of the season for its regular lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"Matlock," "In the Heat of the Night" and "Law &amp; Order" were in the top 20. 
NBC had a 15.8 rating and a 26 share, with ABC on "Roseanne" night having a 
14.2 rating and a 24 share, while CBS had an 8.4 rating and a 14 share. 
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday audience also made "Law &amp; Order," in 20th place, the 
highest-rated of the season's new shows, beating even ABC's "America's Funniest 
People," in a tie for 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
CBS premiered a new sitcom last week: Nell Carter in "You Take the Kids," which 
ranked 66th. 
</P>
<P>
NBC recaptured the lead for the week -- its ninth win this season -- with a 
12.4 rating and a 21 share. ABC was second with an 11.6 rating and a 20 share, 
barely beating CBS, which had an 11.5 rating and a 19 share. 
</P>
<P>
In the highly competitive 13-week-old season-to-date, NBC maintained its lead 
with a 13.0 rating and 22 share, while ABC was just 0.4 of a ratings behind 
with a 12.6 rating and a 21 share, and CBS only 0.6 of a rating point off the 
lead with a 12.4 rating and a 21 share. 
</P>
<P>
Night-by-night competition saw NBC win Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and 
Saturday, while ABC took Monday and Friday, and CBS captured Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's "World News Tonight" was No. 1 for the 49th consecutive week, with an 
11.6 rating and a 22 share. "CBS Evening News" with Dan Rather came in second 
with a 10.0 rating and a 19 share, and "NBC Nightly News" with Tom Brokaw was 
third with a 9.9 rating a 19 share. 
</P>
<P>
Each ratings point represents about 921,000 households. A share is the 
percentage of TV sets in use that are tuned to a particular show or network.

Art sales plummeted for Christie's during 1990, prompting plans to cut 10% from 
its worldwide staff costs, the fine art auction house announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Impressionist and contemporary art sales were hardest hit, after providing 48% 
of the auctioneer's record sales in 1989, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
A stormy world economy and the Persian Gulf crisis were blamed for an 8.5% drop 
in total sales to $1.96 billion from last year's record $2.14 billion, 
Christie's said. 
</P>
<P>
"While medium to long-term prospects for auction markets are encouraging, the 
reality today is that the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States are in 
the grip of economic uncertainty which has been intensified by the situation in 
the gulf," Christie's Chairman Lord Carrington said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have, therefore, decided to take prompt action to reduce our cost base 
significantly enough to weather the current climate, but in a way which will 
not erode our ability to take full advantage of the next upturn in the market," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts will include 10% cuts in total staff costs with salary freezes for most 
senior-level personnel in addition to cuts in other operating costs, Christie's 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lower-level staffing will be reviewed "according to established practice and 
with due consideration to the cost of living and their contribution to the 
company," the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's said it expects long-term market growth in Europe and the Far East 
and has added offices or agents in Berlin; Frankfurt, Germany; Bordeaux and 
Lyon, France; Athens, and Taipei.

Mortgage &amp; Realty plan -- An article Dec. 11 about a proposed bankruptcy 
court reorganization plan for Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust incorrectly stated 
that the company's creditors and stockholders had approved the plan. The plan 
is still subject to their approval, although committees for both groups support 
the proposal.

PAVING OVER THE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Madeline DeAntonio's letter about the paving of the dirt portion 
of Mulholland Drive, this would cause a plethora of problems, including: 
</P>
<P>
* Severe geological and environmental damage to the area and to Topanga State 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
* Increased air pollution and an increase of greenhouse gases, all detrimental 
to our health. 
</P>
<P>
* Increased potential for Rustic and Sullivan canyons to become trash dumps, 
and an increase in police and fire problems with their threats to lives and 
property. 
</P>
<P>
* High financial cost of construction, and acceleration and exacerbation of the 
growth problems in the mountains and in the West Valley with subsequent 
increases in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
* An increase in erosion from hard-surface runoff, and severe negative and 
safety impacts to the park users. 
</P>
<P>
All of this for a possible temporary relief to traffic problems in one area. 
</P>
<P>
The long-term solutions to these problems are an effective mass transit system 
coupled with no-growth policies. High-percentage mandatory recycling will keep 
the garbage trucks off our streets and the trash out of our canyons. We welcome 
the Encino Hillside Traffic Safety Organization and all citizens to work for 
these. The Sierra Club will vigorously continue in these efforts.

P-I-E International Is Going Out of Business: The trucking firm that filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October will cease operations Dec. 29, 
laying off its 3,000 employees. P-I-E, a unit of Olympia Holding Corp. of Miami 
and a sister company of insolvent Transcon Lines of Los Angeles, said a 
bankruptcy trustee will be appointed to oversee its liquidation. 
</P>
<P>
The company cited the economy, fuel prices and adverse publicity associated 
with the Chapter 11 filing for its inability to continue operations. It also 
announced an agreement to sell its business to Intermodal Transportation 
Services Inc. of Downer's Grove, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Intermodal's parent is controlled by some of the same people who control 
Transcon Lines and P-I-E. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
