MAYOR BRADLEY SNUBS MOLINA, BACKS TORRES IN SUPERVISOR RACE 
</P>

Snubbing a City Hall colleague, Mayor Tom Bradley on Tuesday endorsed state 
Sen. Art Torres for Los Angeles County supervisor from a field of nine 
candidates that includes Councilwoman Gloria Molina. 
</P>
<P>
Torres' campaign advisers said the endorsement would carry weight not only in 
Los Angeles city neighborhoods that make up about one-fourth of the new 1st 
District, but in other communities as well. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who don't live in the city who think Tom Bradley is 
their mayor," said Dee Dee Myers, spokeswoman for Torres, a Los Angeles 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Molina sought to turn Bradley's support of Torres to her advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Bradley demands an absolute kind of loyalty, and that is something I don't 
provide to anyone," she said. "I have enjoyed my independence on the council." 
</P>
<P>
Molina said she did not seek Bradley's endorsement, but conceded that it would 
help Torres. The councilwoman questioned the extent of the help, contending 
that the mayor's popularity has declined because of his political problems. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said the mayor's endorsement "means that I can get along with people at 
every level of government." 
</P>
<P>
Molina and Torres are seeking to become the county's first Latino supervisor 
this century in the Jan. 22 election. Other candidates include state Sen. 
Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) and Sarah Flores, a former aide to Supervisor 
Pete Schabarum. The new district was carved out by a federal judge who ruled 
that the old district lines denied the county's 3 million Latinos political 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said his endorsement came as the result of a long friendship with 
Torres. 
</P>
<P>
"He and I have been friends and mutual supporters," the mayor said. "I've known 
him for almost as long as I've been in politics. I admire him for his vision 
and for his courage and for his creativity. . . . I believe that he will bring 
to the board progressive, forward-thinking ideas and the ability to make 
friends and to work together with the city." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Molina, Bradley said: "I'm here to support Art Torres, not to talk 
in a negative fashion about any other candidate." 
</P>
<P>
The other major candidates downplayed the endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Flores issued a press release listing her endorsements from 58 mayors and city 
council members within the new 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon said: "I never sought Bradley's endorsement because I don't believe 
it's important. . . . It puts Art Torres in an interesting position. He has 
taken a strong stance criticizing the city of Los Angeles for dumping over 70% 
of its garbage in the San Gabriel Valley and then he turns around and goes to 
get the endorsement of its chief." 
</P>
<P>
Torres responded: "You're going to have sour grapes from any candidate who 
doesn't receive the support of Tom Bradley. . . . The people in the San Gabriel 
Valley know and respect Tom Bradley. The people in Los Angeles know and respect 
Tom Bradley."

UCSD DOCTOR DEFENDS ADVICE TO MEXICANS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: A PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGIST CALLS A STATE INVESTIGATION A 'WITCH HUNT' 
AND SAYS THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH TELLING THE PARENTS OF ILL CHILDREN ABOUT 
BETTER MEDICAL CARE ACROSS THE BORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A UC San Diego physician being investigated by the state for allegedly coaching 
the parents of Mexican children on how to qualify for free health care in the 
United States insisted Tuesday that she was in no way guilty of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Lilliam M. Valdes-Cruz, a pediatric cardiologist at UCSD who sees patients 
in university-run clinics in Tijuana and Mexicali, acknowledged in an interview 
in the office of her attorney that she occasionally tells parents where better 
care can be obtained. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't help them get across," she said insistently, adding that she feels 
a medical obligation to inform parents of a better, safer alternative, 
particularly if a child's heart condition is serious. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I have told them that better care would be available in hospitals 
in Mexico City and San Diego, but if they come here (San Diego), they do so of 
their own accord," she said. "It isn't something I facilitate." 
</P>
<P>
In October, UCSD's center of pediatric cardiology became the focus of a 
controversy, in which state officials began investigating reports that medical 
care for as many as 100 children who suffer from heart problems was being 
illegally funded through Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the State Department of Health Services believe UCSD Medical 
Center may have improperly billed the state for at least $1 million. State 
investigators believe the children were first seen at a Tijuana clinic where 
UCSD doctors volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
State authorities allege that UCSD doctors aided parents of the children by 
helping them obtain letters for U.S. immigration officials, certifying that the 
children would be treated at UCSD without taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
State investigators charged that UCSD officials impeded their investigation by 
initially blocking attempts to interview staff members and not making key 
documents available to them. The documents were not available to investigators 
until subpoenas were delivered for them. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cases identified by state investigators involve poor children who 
might otherwise never have had access to American health care. But one case 
being investigated is that of the infant son of a Mexican cattle rancher who is 
thought to own thousands of acres, according to state investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Blank, the attorney for Valdes-Cruz, said Tuesday that several patients 
had been guilty of wrongdoing in falsifying applications -- by, for instance, 
listing as their own the addresses of relatives living in California -- but it 
was not something that doctors helped them with. 
</P>
<P>
Blank said it was his suspicion that some patients may have attempted to blame 
doctors, once state authorities began to question them. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she were part of a "network" that aided Mexican children, poor or 
otherwise, in obtaining medical care in the United States, Valdes-Cruz said, 
"There is no network . . . certainly that I've been involved in." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Valdes-Cruz, the state also is investigating Dr. Azucena Murillo 
and a hospital secretary, Mercedes A. Alvarado. Murillo, who is not licensed to 
practice in the United States, worked as a research associate in pediatric 
cardiology at UCSD Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Medi-Cal allegations and the death of a 3-year-old Tijuana 
boy at the hospital in July, state authorities say Murillo is being 
investigated for practicing medicine without a license. 
</P>
<P>
According to a coroner's autopsy, the boy died of a "drug-related accident," 
after being given a sedative drawn into an oral syringe by Murillo. The boy 
died soon after being given the sedative by his mother. 
</P>
<P>
As an outgrowth of the continuing investigations, Dr. David Sahn was removed as 
head of the pediatric cardiology division late last month. Sahn was replaced by 
Dr. Kyung Chung, who was named acting head of the division. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD officials have said they are conducting their own inquiries, independent 
of the state, into allegations of both bogus Medi-Cal payments and the death of 
the boy. 
</P>
<P>
"When they come to me, I don't know whether a person has the resources to pay 
or not," Valdes-Cruz said Tuesday. "I don't ask them; that's not my job. That 
is determined by whoever determines whether a person can qualify for state care 
for indigent or low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
"I literally don't know the nature of employment of three quarters of the 
parents of the patients I see." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she knew their insurance mechanism, Valdes-Cruz said, "Hardly ever. 
That is not something I get concerned with. I don't know any physicians who do. 
It's a piece of information we take for granted . . . that's happening 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't particularly pay attention to it. We are not in a private 
institution. We help people of all sorts, from the rich to the poorest of the 
poor. I don't think it makes any difference to most of the people at UCSD. And 
it is not something I inquire about." 
</P>
<P>
Valdes-Cruz said many of her patients often travel back and forth between the 
United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprises me that people are amazed by things like this happening in a 
border town," she said, explaining how easily people move from one country to 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
"And, in one sense, it disturbs me. I now see a witch hunt surrounding patients 
with Hispanic surnames." 
</P>
<P>
Valdes-Cruz said the so-called witch hunt had gotten much worse since the 
allegations surfaced. But, despite the allegations, she reiterated that she has 
done nothing wrong and pointed a finger at no one else. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any wrong was committed here, by anybody," she said. "I don't 
see any impropriety . . . at any point."

HOSTAGE STANDOFF ENDS AT PRISON AFTER 17 HOURS; 
</P>
<P>
MCC: FEDERAL AGENTS STORM CELL WHERE PAIR OF INMATES HELD A GUARD CAPTIVE, 
THREATENING TO KILL HIM WITH A KNIFE THEY MADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A heavily armed FBI SWAT team stormed a cell at the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center in downtown San Diego on Tuesday, ending a nearly 17-hour standoff with 
two inmates who had taken a prison guard hostage in their cell. 
</P>
<P>
The guard, Donnie Houston, 29, was examined at UC San Diego Medical Center, 
where doctors found that he had suffered "seemingly no injuries at all," a 
hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
A second guard, Robert Gibson, 29, suffered minor injuries while escaping from 
the cell shortly after the inmates overpowered the guards about 9 p.m. Monday, 
prison spokesman Gavin O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates were taken into custody at 1:40 p.m. Tuesday, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
"Staff is looking into the way the situation concluded," he said. "They have to 
get written statements from the FBI and all staff involved." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said he did not expect the report to be available until this morning. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first hostage-taking incident at the federal prison since it opened 
15 years ago, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates had demanded access to the media to talk about living conditions in 
their cells, said Sheldon Sherman, the attorney for one of the men. They also 
wanted to make a bargain with the U.S. attorney in which Rodriguez would 
receive credit for time served and be freed in exchange for Houston's release. 
None of the demands were met. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Olivo Cruz and Jose Rodriguez, both originally from Cuba, held Houston 
hostage in the cell they shared in a high-security area of the 12-story prison, 
O'Connor said. They had apparently fashioned a knife-like weapon from furniture 
in the cell. No details were available about how the inmates overcame the two 
guards or how Gibson escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz previously escaped from prison in Florida, where he was serving two life 
sentences, O'Connor said. Cruz and Rodriguez, both 32, were being held at MCC 
on drug-related charges. 
</P>
<P>
A federal agent who had arrested the pair during a drug sting in San Diego 
recognized Cruz in October while watching a television program about unsolved 
crimes, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent in San Diego told The 
Times last month. Fingerprint checks confirmed that Cruz was actually Emilio 
Bravo, who had escaped from prison in Dade County, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz pleaded guilty to charges of trying to rob federal agents in the sting and 
was awaiting sentencing. Rodriguez was awaiting trial on the charge, O'Connor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
SWAT team members stormed the cell after Houston started screaming, said 
Sherman, who was representing Rodriguez on the drug charges. Sherman and 
federal public defender David Cohen, who represented Cruz, were called in about 
10 p.m. Monday after the inmates refused to continue negotiating with the FBI 
and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
Houston was bound at the hands and feet and was sitting in a corner of the 
cell, Sherman said. The inmates repeatedly threatened to kill him as 30 SWAT 
officers stood just out of sight with automatic rifles poised. 
</P>
<P>
Cells in the high-security area on the fifth floor are "specially equipped to 
restrict movement of the inmates," O'Connor said. "Only one cell is allowed out 
at a time. The area they are allowed out into is small." 
</P>
<P>
The inmates complained that they were mistreated by guards, let out of their 
cells only one hour a day and severely restricted in their ability to make 
phone calls or have visitors, Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sherman, a staff psychologist wrote a letter to prison authorities 
warning that Rodriguez was becoming mentally ill because of conditions at the 
prison and recommended sending him to Lompoc prison's high-security ward, where 
he would be afforded more freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was shuffled between Lompoc and the MCC, brought to San Diego for 
court appearances, and had been at MCC for a few days before the hostage 
scenario unfolded, Sherman said.

ARRESTS IN TIJUANA DEATHS CONFIRMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MONICA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tijuana officials confirmed Tuesday that three people are in custody in 
connection with the carbon monoxide poisoning deaths last week of 12 people in 
a house during a religious ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
But Mexican officials said they have not asked the FBI for help in finding two 
people described as Americans who allegedly were at the ritual, denying a 
report carried by the Mexican news agency Excelsior. 
</P>
<P>
The three people in custody are being held on charges of abandonment because 
they allegedly failed to call authorities when they discovered 18 people lying 
unconscious in the house. Six survived. 
</P>
<P>
The three -- Ana Fabiola Miranda Juarez, 19; Gerardo Barrios Rodriguez, 20, and 
Estela Jimenez Ceballos, 46 -- were all arrested Thursday, the day the bodies 
were found. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, authorities said they were questioning Miranda, but Tuesday was the 
first time they disclosed that all three are in custody and under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
It will now be up to the Tijuana district attorney's office to determine 
whether any of the three have any responsibility in the deaths, said Jaime Sam 
Fierro, commander of the Baja California Judicial Police in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda had gone to the house about 7 a.m. Thursday to look for her mother, 
Gloria Miranda Juarez, who owned the house in the Colonia Mariano Matamoros on 
the southeastern outskirts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, the younger Miranda found the people in the house 
unconscious, with the exception of an 8-month-old girl, Ana Karen Osuna, who 
was crying. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than calling police or emergency medical assistance, she allegedly went 
to see Barrios Rodriguez, a friend who lives in the Matamoros neighborhood, and 
told him what happened. 
</P>
<P>
The two then drove to another nearby neighborhood, Colonia Castillo, to look 
for Jimenez Ceballos, whom police described as a "medium." Miranda and Barrios 
Rodriguez sought out Jimenez to see if she could provide religious help for the 
people at the house. 
</P>
<P>
"They told the woman what had happened instead of letting the authorities 
know," Fierro said. "Those persons, having known what had happened, never 
called the Red Cross or the police." Police did not elaborate on what the pair 
did after seeking out Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, the Red Cross responds to medical emergencies just as paramedics do 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"By knowing what had taken place and not having told anyone, they became 
involved in the matter," Fierro said. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Gloria Miranda Juarez and 11 others in the house died of 
carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty lamp powered by butane gas, chemical 
experts with the judicial police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Miranda Juarez had lived in the house with Federico Padres Mexia, the 
leader of the religious group that relied in part on mediums to conduct 
elaborate prayer rituals, which included burning sulfur and, in at least some 
instances, rubbing their bodies with perfume. 
</P>
<P>
Mexia, along with two others -- Juan Jose Sarabia Estrada and Consuelo Ponce -- 
remain comatose in Tijuana hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
As for the report that Mexican authorities had asked for the FBI's help, Fierro 
denied that such a request was ever made, or that Americans were at the 
ill-fated ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not true. There was no one from the United States there," Fierro said. 
"Everyone there was Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
He said the only organization ever contacted for help was the San Diego Police 
Department, in order to get help in performing tests on the victims' blood and 
tissue. Those tests were eventually done by the San Diego County medical 
examiner. 
</P>
<P>
But some relatives of the dead told reporters that two Americans were at the 
ritual and were seen leaving the house sometime during the night. But the 
relatives said that they did not have a description of the couple and that they 
had received their information from people in the neighborhood.

SKIPPER PERISHES WHEN BOAT CAPSIZES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man was killed and another fell into the ocean when a fishing boat headed 
for New Zealand capsized Monday about 980 miles southwest of San Diego, a Coast 
Guard spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The skipper of the Viva, Richard Ennis, 53, of Morro Bay, was lost after he 
became trapped aboard the 47-foot boat when it capsized about 1 p.m., said 
Timothy Rowe, a Coast Guard spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Before his death, Ennis warned crewman Terry Groat, 26, of Crescent City to 
abandon ship. "Apparently (Groat) was sleeping, and the ship's master went in 
and woke him up," Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
Groat was reportedly thrown from the vessel but rescued by the crew of the 
Billie Marie, a fishing vessel traveling with the Viva. Both vessels list Morro 
Bay, about 350 miles north of San Diego, as their home port, Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the capsizing is under investigation.

JUDGE'S SON SENTENCED IN ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam became a spectator in court Tuesday as he 
watched his 33-year-old son sentenced to one year in County Jail for robbing 
two taxicab drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Kenneth Gilliam was also placed on five years' probation, fined $200 and 
ordered to repay cabbie John Plough the $66 stolen from him Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge H. Ronald Domnitz specified that Gilliam be tested 
for drug use every two weeks, attend drug counseling three times a week and 
refrain from using public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said that, if Gilliam violates the terms of his probation, he will go 
to prison for as long as 10 years. The sentence will be reviewed April 24. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Garrett Randall had suggested a four-year state prison term. 
He said Gilliam had admitted to robbing the drivers to get money to obtain 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam pleaded guilty to robbing Plough and cabdriver Raymond Garcia on Sept. 
18. Garcia lost a gold chain that was recovered by police. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, who could have received a maximum seven years and four months in 
prison, apologized to Plough, saying, "You did not deserve to be treated that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had been up all night using drugs before the 8 a.m. holdup. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really very ashamed of what I've done," Gilliam said. "I know I'm guilty . 
. . and I have some serious problems emotionally. I have drug problems, 
depression. One thing I don't want to do is drugs or alcohol anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Gilliam was appointed to the federal bench in 1980 by President Jimmy 
Carter and was a Superior Court judge for many years in the 1970s.

OFFICER FOUND JUSTIFIED IN SHOOTING SUSPECT ARMED WITH 2 GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County district attorney's office has ruled that the San Diego 
police shooting of a 22-year-old man was justified because the man was getting 
ready to fire a semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Sylvester White, carrying both the pistol and a sawed-off shotgun, was 
injured in the September shooting and charged with assault with a firearm on a 
peace officer. 
</P>
<P>
His Superior Court trial is set for Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said White is known to be a member of the West 
Coast Crips gang and was on parole for kidnaping after being released in April 
from state prison. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office gave this account of the shooting: 
</P>
<P>
Police Officer William Alan Albrektsen spotted White at 2:13 a.m. Sept. 5 and 
began following him in his patrol car. White, with an object under his arm, 
quickened his pace. Albrektsen thought the man had a gun, got out of the car 
and ordered White to stop. White then ran into an apartment building and began 
pounding on a door to get inside. Albrektsen followed and told him to put his 
hands up and drop what he had under his arm. 
</P>
<P>
Albrektsen said he warned White several times before he saw White "either pull 
out his shirt or push up his jacket." Albrektsen said White grabbed a gun out 
of his waistband and, when "he started bringing it towards me . . . that's when 
I fired." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office ruled that Albrektsen was justified in using 
force to protect himself.

REPARATIONS FOR BLACK AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was with growing anger that I read the article (Metro, Dec. 10) detailing 
Robert Brock's desire for "reparations" for black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
To say that I, a 26-year-old white American, am responsible for things done to 
long dead black Americans by equally long dead white Americans is an affront to 
intelligence.

Brock would have, I suppose, all white Americans have a special tax levied on 
them because of their race. This would be done in order to punish white people 
for the sins of their race. Is this not the worst sort of racism? Is this not 
the same of thinking that Hitler had toward the Jews? 
</P>
<P>
Rather than ever submit to a plan like Brock's, I would die fighting it. 
</P>
<P>
What still amazes me is that you at The Times would run this trash.

Three cheers for Robert Brock. He is correct in his assertion that America is 
indebted to the descendants of former slaves. 
</P>
<P>
Slaves provided much of labor that formed the foundation upon which this 
country was built. The rewards of the labor provided by slaves wound up in the 
pockets of the slave owners. Descendants of slave owners have therefore amassed 
fortunes from the blood and sweat of African slaves. 
</P>
<P>
How can anyone deny that America has profited from the work of slave labor? The 
question is not "Does America owe descendants of former slaves anything?" The 
question is "When will America give African-Americans the share of America's 
wealth their ancestors have earned?" 
</P>
<P>
Keep up the good work, Mr. Brock. The truth is on your side.

I can no longer ignore my conscience. I have to tell you about Florence. I 
first met her 1 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Then, she had only been homeless for a couple of months. She reminded me of my 
grandmother. I asked for her name and she told me. It was the last time she 
ever answered one of my questions. It was also the last time she ever asked me 
for money. 
</P>
<P>
Since then I have seen Florence dozens of times on the streets of Hollywood. 
Mostly she is curled up in the fetal position, but sometimes I actually see her 
walking. All her pores are filled with dirt and her nails are several inches 
long and curling around her fingertips. She is constantly talking to characters 
that I do not see, though I am sure to her they are very real. 
</P>
<P>
Every time I see Florence I go to her and say hello but she does not answer. 
Sometimes she will take money from me though she nevers says anything to me. I 
can see in her eyes that she is alive and "in there." 
</P>
<P>
I am sure that I live in the greatest country on Earth and I probably would die 
for the causes our Founding Fathers seem to have had. The "bottom line" in my 
heart is that I am very ashamed of the way my government has taken care of 
Florence.

The federal government will not have undone the racism that was embedded in the 
Constitution until it formally makes restitution for the slavery that it 
legitimized and protected for 87 years. The social inequities of that system 
will continue to debase and cripple our country until we can own up to the 
horrors for which we as a society were responsible.

Our health as a nation -- and quite possibly our survival -- depends on our

COSMETIC INTIMACY COLORS A MOST INTIMATE RITUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the old days in Russia, women began and ended their lives in the bath house. 
They went there to give birth; they went there as brides, the day before they 
married. And when people died, it was in the baths that women washed the 
bodies. The intimacy of tired flesh, of forgiveness and renewal -- where do 
women know such closeness now? 
</P>
<P>
In the old days in Russia, Zhanna Khotik was a factory's production manager. 
She was a university graduate, a person of position. Her husband was an 
engineer, a man of stature who carried himself well. Before she came to 
America, she had not thought that her husband would toil here as a construction 
worker, or that, in this brave new world, she would end up waxing hair from 
legs, bikini lines and armpits. 
</P>
<P>
Her customers like Zhanna: She is large, soft, comforting, old-fashioned as 
they themselves have no wish to be. Her long Titian hair is tucked untidily 
away in a bun; her smile is broad; she wipes her hands on a fresh apron as if 
it were an apple pie that she were tackling, not stubborn hairs to be pulled by 
the roots. She remembers what others forget: whose family doesn't talk, whose 
father is sick, whose child has nightmares, the small sadnesses that find no 
other home. 
</P>
<P>
She has set up her beauty bed, her pot of warm and syrupy wax, in the back room 
of a nail parlor on Santa Monica Boulevard. It is a parlor of Russians and 
Romanians and the air is alive with the velvet of their language: Adrianna, who 
specializes in pedicures; Maggie, plump and cozy in the corner; Gilda, all 
glittering drama by the front door -- her husband has done better than most -- 
and, against the far wall, Virginia, silent and broad, nodding over nails that 
are broken, talons created over stubble, coats of invincible lacquer. 
</P>
<P>
The clients' armchairs, deep and club-like, face into the room. They talk 
constantly: diets, divorces, the triumph of shopping, with petulance over 
stains on silk, of maids who let them down. And while the lacquer sets, they 
sink into other chairs, hands twittering, toes curling out from rubber stands 
to keep the ruby or the shocking pink from smudging. The talking never ceases; 
its intimacy gives no clue as to who is a close friend, who a face glimpsed 
today for the first time. The salon hears of the man who cannot commit, the 
weekend that soured, the ex-husband who tries not to pay -- neither privacy nor 
restraint. The great knowing eyes from Kiev and Bucharest absorb it all. 
</P>
<P>
To Zhanna, locked in the little back room, they relate their lives: operations, 
marriages, vacations, and in her kind and equable way, she worries for them. 
Somewhere are aunts who are never phoned, mothers rarely seen, grandmothers 
long forgotten; Zhanna becomes them all in the hour of half-legs and 
under-arms. 
</P>
<P>
She treasures what 11 years in America have brought her: a home in distant 
hills, college education for her sons, a car, a holiday once in New York. And 
she keeps to herself the sadness for her own mother who died so far away, for 
her mother-in-law's present suffering. Each night after work, she drives for 
hours to the hospital, grateful to have found one that would take a sick old 
woman with the wrong insurance. "You have to be lucky in life," Zhanna says. 
"Even in dying, you have to be lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Unspoken sorrows: They are not plump, these Russians and Romanians, because 
they do not care -- but because they care too much. They hold up the sky so 
that others may walk beneath. 
</P>
<P>
And what of the clients, who drop $19 for a pedicure or a nail fill, $170 for a 
handbag, on a whim, from a visiting peddler? How many tip as generously, or 
remember to ask about Adrianna's surgery, her aching back, the constant fear of 
bad times? Ah, the profligacy of a smile where friendship is not the greatest 
gift in our possession. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days in Russia, women began and ended their days in the bath house. 
Have we reduced intimacy to the size of a finger nail, the depth of a hair 
root?

I think it was Gladstone who described his duties as prime minister of Britain 
as that of the guy on a raft in a rapids, using a pole to keep the raft from 
smashing into the rocks. That is probably history's most honest rendering of 
how government actually functions. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the metaphor: The ship of state is referred to as a raft -- the most 
unmanageable of watercraft. The person in command does not use a rudder, which 
is how you steer a ship. He uses a pole to fend off rocks -- he is reactive 
rather than pro-active, trying to avoid disaster rather than trying to steer a 
proper course. And the raft is being carried down a rapids -- he has no idea 
where he is going but is being swept along by forces he cannot control. 
</P>
<P>
There are two great fictions about life that people in government and, worse, 
in the media, treat as gospel. The first is that people in high-government 
offices all over the world know what they are doing. The second is that 
government officials in crises make brilliant tactical moves. 
</P>
<P>
The Persian Gulf crisis offers itself as an object lesson in how history works 
before historians get their chance to change it. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 2, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. One may reasonably assume that he 
took this action in anticipation of doubling his country's net financial worth 
at minimum cost. Earlier discussions with the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad, 
unfortunately, reinforced that view. Perhaps he had plans for a further sojourn 
south into Saudi Arabia, perhaps not. At the least, he anticipated that he 
would be able to dominate Saudi Arabia politically through the overt threat of 
military force on its borders, allowing him to maximize the economic benefit of 
his oil wealth through market control. If successful, it would have been called 
a master stroke. 
</P>
<P>
But there aren't many master strokes in human history. This same Saddam Hussein 
10 years ago launched a war of aggression into Iran in hope of achieving a 
quick, cheap victory, and that war mutated into an eight-year nightmare -- 
World War I fought with some of World War III's weapons -- that took the lives 
of more than a million people. And after invading Kuwait, Hussein gave back 
what little he had gained at the cost of between 2% and 3% of his total 
population; this action -- called by some a brilliant maneuver -- was 
undertaken to secure his northeastern frontier against a country that would 
still probably like to see his head on a pike. Any reasonable analysis will 
suggest that the move was one of desperation rather than brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's subsequent moves have shown little greater perception. Taking unto 
himself thousands of hostages, he tried to give them back in dribs and drabs to 
any official or amateur agent who bothered purchasing air fare to Baghdad. He 
failed to consider the logic of his own action, and either got carried away and 
decided to give them all back, or decided that there was no further use in 
holding them. That is, after enraging people all over the world through 
kidnaping, he is seeking to garner favor by admitting his crime and returning 
his victims. It would have made far more sense not to have taken them, or 
having done so, to hold onto them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons given for releasing the hostages is the most laughable of 
all: that Hussein was encouraged by resistance among Americans and within 
Congress to the President's action. One might speculate that Hussein's 
ambassador in Washington -- yet another perceptive individual -- failed to tell 
his boss that the President's drop in approval polls more probably reflected 
the same waffling on budget matters that hurt Republican congressional 
candidates (people do not compartmentalize their views on a person's 
competence) and that the drop was already reversing itself anyway. And Congress 
will do what it always does in a time of crisis -- that is, it looks concerned 
while taking no substantive action, like every other committee in the civilized 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, we are inundated by news stories -- and their most dreaded 
companions, "news analysis" columns -- telling us of the cleverness of 
Hussein's political and psychological maneuvering. Those pieces are often 
written by the very commentators who warned for two generations of the 
political demise of NATO and the brilliant psychological campaigns of the 
Warsaw Pact (that is, preventing us from deploying theater nuclear forces), 
which, by the way, no longer exists, though the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization is as strong as ever. 
</P>
<P>
On the American side, while it is true that President Bush has done 
extraordinarily well in organizing world reaction against Hussein, it probably 
helped that geopolitical conflict between the United States and the Soviet 
Union has ended. As a result, there was no one else around to stoke up 
opposition, and with only one banner to march behind, the world marched with 
Bush more or less by default. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, our buildup of forces, impressive as it has been, has at all times 
been fully regulated by objective forces. The U.S. Merchant Marine is so 
depleted that we could not have deployed our heavy forces -- you can't fly 
tanks from place to place very efficiently -- any faster regardless of the 
situation. We came within a whisker of chartering at least one Russian ship to 
help speed our deployment, which one might also call a sign of some 
desperation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, we have the comedy of manners taking place on Capitol Hill. One U.S. 
senator lambasts the secretary of state for not having any decent alternatives 
to the use of force, but on being asked for one, admits that he doesn't have a 
clue. Another senator criticizes the secretary of defense for getting our 
troops a little too ready for action, then admits that he once told the 
secretary that getting our troops ready to win was his only job. An overweening 
consistency, as Emerson liked to say, is the hobgoblin of little minds. One 
wonders if the quote might not have been flubbed by his editor. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness to Congress, one need only look at history. Horace Greeley who, 
during the 1860 election campaign, was a firebrand for emancipation at any 
price, immediately after the election of Lincoln decided that letting the 
Southern states go in peace, while retaining their "peculiar institution," was 
not so bad an idea after all. 
</P>
<P>
As I said earlier, this is a most interesting case study of what actually 
happens before historians get a chance to change it all. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing theme is reasonably clear, however. People are all the same. 
While still in the insurance business, I developed Clancy's Law of Accidents: 
The only difference between a wise man and a fool is that a wise man makes much 
more serious mistakes. Privates don't lose battles; generals do, and you have 
to be smart to become a general. You must also be smart to be a physician, but 
they kill patients all the time. It's merely human nature. Everyone makes 
mistakes. One's title or office does not make one immune. The problem is that a 
lot of people with titles and offices act as though they are immune, and the 
media contribute to this fiction. 
</P>
<P>
People in all fields of life fail to think their actions through. They begin to 
do something about an immediate tactical problem but without examining the 
downstream consequences of their action. Hitler invaded Poland thinking that 
England and France would not honor their recent guarantee to the Poles. Johnson 
put troops in Vietnam without examining their mission. Reagan put Marines in 
Beirut without wondering what they would do there or when they might leave. The 
Russians tried for years to outstrip Western military spending without noticing 
that they vitiated their own economy in the process. The phenomenon is not 
merely international, of course. Domestically, we installed a welfare system 
that wrecked poor families and were surprised at the crime that resulted; we 
started federal student loans and then watched college costs outstrip inflation 
faster than a space-shuttle launch. And so forth. It would help if people 
admitted mistakes, but those with titles and offices are never very keen on 
that, are they -- and are the rest of us any more willing? 
</P>
<P>
But the media -- and, later, historians with telescopic but selective hindsight 
-- see purpose in random behavior and brilliance in befuddlement. Politicians 
undertake actions most often by spasm or whim, perhaps with no more thought 
than a motorist fighting his way home on the freeway, changing lanes to get a 
few yards of progress, and in the process adding to the jam rather than letting 
it sort itself out. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't anybody think? The cost of not thinking is often death and misery, and 
if the media ever started pointing that out instead of imputing legitimacy to 
every random remark of political figures, maybe we could save a life or two. At 
the very least we might let people know what is actually going on.

IN THIS WHITE HOUSE, PRINCIPLE IS JUST THE POLITICS OF THE DAY; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOLARSHIPS: THE REVERSAL OF THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT PROVES THAT THE 
PRESIDENT DOESN'T BELIEVE HIS OWN WORDS ABOUT QUOTAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY EASTLAND, Terry Eastland is a resident fellow of the Ethics and Public 
Policy Center in Washington and co-author of Counting by Race (Basic Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a press conference last week announcing the Education Department's policy 
against race-exclusive scholarships, Assistant Secretary Michael Williams 
remarked that his job was to enforce the law. On Tuesday, at a press conference 
amending that policy, Williams said that he had been "politically naive." 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to imagine a worse sin than political naivete in the Bush 
Administration, unless it is a conscientious effort to enforce the law. It 
happens that Williams simultaneously committed both, becoming perfectly 
symbolic of a presidency not only dedicated to expediency above duty but also 
willfully confused about civil-rights law and lacking a coherent civil-rights 
policy. Only the most result-oriented civil-rights liberal could applaud this 
depressing chapter in the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a 37-year-old lawyer who is black, has the duty of enforcing federal 
civil-rights laws applying to higher education. He announced last week that 
almost all scholarships designated exclusively for minority students were 
illegal. Neither state nor private colleges and universities, he said, may 
offer such aid. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams had not factored in either the criticism of his policy by 
civil-rights lobbies or the weakness of the chief executive's backbone. Wanting 
no more from the lobbies, which had attacked him for successfully branding the 
recent civil-rights legislation a "quotas" bill, Bush quickly caved, posting 
notice through his press secretary that he was "very disturbed." Tuesday's 
revised policy was a virtually complete reversal. 
</P>
<P>
It is a wacky reversal. Williams now says that the relevant regulations will be 
"enforced in such a way" -- enforced, not interpreted, mind you -- "as to 
permit universities receiving federal funds to administer scholarships 
established and funded by private persons or entities (who restrict) 
eligibility for such scholarships to minority students." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, and for example, the Education Department now will not bat an 
eye as the Fiesta Bowl -- a private entity -- gives the universities of 
Louisville and Alabama the $100,000 it had pledged to them exclusively for 
minority students in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., until the politically 
illiterate Williams flashed a red light of illegality. Louisville and Alabama 
are state-funded public schools, but under the amended policy, the Education 
Department also would avert its eyes if, for example, Pennsylvania's Grove City 
College, which is private, were in the Fiesta Bowl and the recipient of its 
$100,000 minority-scholarship fund. Only if a private institution were to use 
its own funds for race-exclusive scholarships might the department trouble 
itself to intervene, and then only, one assumes, if Williams asked the White 
House to take a poll. 
</P>
<P>
Conceivably the Administration could have offered a legal rationale for its 
amended policy that is within the realm of reasonable discourse. But it did not 
do so because it could not. Lawyers at both the Justice Department and the 
White House concluded that the law compelled Williams' enforcement policy. 
Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits recipients of federal funds 
from providing different financial-aid programs on the basis of race or 
national origin, and the Civil Rights Act of 1988 provides the legal basis for 
applying Title VI to all aspects of private higher education. 
</P>
<P>
Liberals comfortable with the new policy must ask whether today's victory is 
tomorrow's disaster: The policy is so lacking in legal principle as to allow 
not only a scholarship program named for Martin Luther King Jr. but also one 
named for David Duke. Meanwhile, it should not pass liberal notice that the 
Administration effectively rewrote the 1988 rights act; evidently, private 
institutions will be allowed to do as private donors tell them to do. The Bush 
Administration will not care. 
</P>
<P>
Nor will it trouble itself with the obvious constitutional questions raised by 
race-exclusive scholarships funded by states and localities. These things are 
covered, according to Tuesday's announcement, "by the Supreme Court's decisions 
construing the Constitution and thus cannot be addressed administratively." 
This is an abdication of presidential responsibility to preserve the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Michael Williams say he should have cleared his policy with the 
White House beforehand. But the significance of this story lies in the fact 
that Williams dared enforce unambiguous law in a context that sharply raises 
the most important question in civil rights, namely whether society's benefits 
and opportunities should be allocated solely on the basis of such arbitrary 
characteristics as race and ethnicity. Williams cannot be faulted for thinking 
that a President who has made so much of his opposition to racial quotas would 
not flinch at his enforcement action. That George Bush did so shows how 
unprincipled and unbelievable is his opposition to racial preferences. On civil 
rights, conservatives and liberals both can conclude that this is an 
Administration with no policy but the politics of the day.

with Charles Smith's status uncertain after his already bruised left thigh was 
bumped again, but Schuler informed his team that he is looking at the 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
However, when he talked with reporters after he game, he apparently had not 
decided on any specifics. Maybe he was spending his energy trying to figure how 
a group promoted as one of the best scoring teams has failed to reach 100 
points for the fifth time in five games and how they have lost for the fifth 
time in their last six. 
</P>
<P>
"We just haven't got as consistent play as we want to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler paused and looked at the final statistics: 19 turnovers, 45.2% shooting 
and an unbalanced offense that got 31 of its points from Smith and 22 from Ken 
Norman. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff Martin has played fairly well for us on this trip and has shot well," 
Schuler added. "Our starting guards were four of 17 tonight. Jeff has 
consistently made his shots." 
</P>
<P>
So Martin may be moved into the starting lineup? 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm really not sure," Schuler said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Grant, who as point guard usually sets the tempo for the offense, has been 
as out of sync as anyone, which is no great mystery. Opposing teams have 
spotted the absence of his usual freewheeling style for several games, and so 
has he. For lack of a better description, it looks as if he is not having fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say the wrong word . . . " he said. "But I'm not having that 
much fun. It's not anything to do with losing, because we're almost .500. I 
don't know, but I think about it every night." 
</P>
<P>
And will continue to do so. After Saturday's loss at Milwaukee, when he had 
eight assists, four turnovers and two points, Grant called home to Los Angeles 
and had his roommate start pulling out tapes from last season. When the 
Clippers return from this six-game trip Thursday afternoon, he will start 
watching, hoping to find the difference between then and now. 
</P>
<P>
The one thing he insists is that this has nothing to do with the trade rumors 
that won't go away. Indiana, Charlotte, Sacramento, New York -- will one be his 
next home? Can't worry about it, Grant says. 
</P>
<P>
But there has been a visible change in his game the last couple weeks, making 
him appear far less aggressive. That has its good points -- he is averaging 
only 2.8 turnovers the last nine outings, dropping his season mark to 3.3 -- 
but the third-year player has reached double figures in assists only three 
times in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking a lot instead of just playing," said Grant, also in a nine-of-31 
shooting slump the last five games, including Tuesday, when he missed all four 
shots he took and had six assists and five turnovers. "I never look for my shot 
anymore. And when I do, it's because the 24-second clock is running out and I 
throw up a three, like tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble's day was, at once, a thrill and average. This was his first trip to his 
hometown as an NBA player, a long-awaited event among family and friends that 
resulted in the Clipper rookie spending more than $2,000 for 80 or so tickets, 
in addition to the comps he procured. 
</P>
<P>
It started great, too: Kimble bought a house for his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Then they played the game. 
</P>
<P>
Not so great: four of 13 from the field. Kimble had 10 points and played 30 
minutes, his best numbers in both categories in seven games, but the slump 
continues. He's 15 of 53 (28.3%) the last seven outings. 
</P>
<P>
"It was special for me, knowing all my family and friends were there," said 
Kimble, who was greeted by a nice ovation from the Philadelphia crowd. "I don't 
think we played well, the team or myself, but playing the first game against 
the Sixers was something to remember. As a child, I always wanted to play at 
the Spectrum. I don't want to say I was mesmerized by it all, but I was really 
proud." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ken Norman also had 20 rebounds, tying his career high from Jan. 13, 1989. . . 
. Charles Barkley had 25 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists for the 76ers, 
and Rickey Green added 21 points. . . . The Clippers allowed a team to shoot 
50% or better for the third time in six games.

<P>
A record was the last thing on Shaquille O'Neal's mind after missing four shots 
in a row in the first five minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Louisiana State's 7-foot-1 sophomore center finally got going and didn't 
stop until he had set an LSU Assembly Center record with 53 points, 37 in the 
second half, to lead the 10th-ranked Tigers (5-1) to a 98-74 victory over 
Arkansas State at Baton Rouge, La., Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record was 50 set by Chris Jackson against Tennessee in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal finished with 18 field goals in 26 tries. He missed two shots in the 
second half and made 17 of 21 from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Indiana 87, No. 18 Kentucky 84 -- Calbert Cheaney scored 23 points and 
Jamal Meeks had a steal and two clinching free throws with 14 seconds left as 
the Hoosiers beat foul-plagued Kentucky (5-2)) at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Five Kentucky players fouled out, including three in the final five minutes as 
Indiana (9-1) rallied from a 73-69 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
No. 23 Texas 87, UC Santa Barbara 84 -- Senior guard Joey Wright made five of 
his 21 free throws in overtime as the Longhorns came back to defeat the Gauchos 
at Goleta, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Wright made 21 of 27 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara (2-2) led, 39-29, at halftime and through much of the second half 
until Guillermo Myers' three-point play with 2:06 remaining gave Texas (4-2) a 
70-69 lead. Santa Barbara point guard Ray Kelly failed to score on four drives 
to the basket late in regulation and in overtime and again missed on the final 
three-point shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
No. 24 Michigan State 81, Evansville 76 -- Steve Smith scored 35 points and 
pulled down 12 rebounds to lead the Spartans past Evansville at East Lansing, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Evansville (3-4) used a 10-1 run to pull within 71-70 with four minutes left, 
but Michigan State (4-3) scored the next four points on a Smith free throw and 
a three-pointer by Kris Weshinskey.

X-rays on inside linebacker Frank Stams' injured right knee revealed some 
ligament damage, and he will miss the rest of the season. But Stams, who hurt 
the knee in the first half of Monday night's loss to the San Francisco 49ers, 
appears to have escaped serious injury, Coach John Robinson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said Bruce Klostermann will play at Stams' spot. 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Damone Johnson, who reinjured his hamstring, and guard Tom Newberry, 
who sprained his left ankle. Robinson said both look doubtful for Sunday's game 
at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that he plans to play both Gaston Green and Cleveland Gary at 
tailback in the remaining two games of 1990, but that he wasn't sure who would 
be the starter. Robinson also said that No. 1 pick Bern Brostek, who played 
left guard after Newberry went down, did an adequate job. TIM KAWAKAMI

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 TEEN-AGERS ARRESTED IN 4 BUNGLED HOLDUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three teen-agers who allegedly bungled four South Bay holdups in less than two 
hours were arrested Tuesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Potential victims foiled the robbery attempts by claiming they had no money and 
speeding away in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
"None of them are candidates for brain surgeons," Sgt. Wally Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Goldsmith, 18; Randy Rogers, 18, and a 15-year-old youth were booked for 
investigation of attempted robbery, Moore said. The three Hawthorne youths said 
they were gang members. 
</P>
<P>
The string of robbery attempts began Monday night in Hermosa Beach when the 
trio allegedly tried to rob a man returning from a store, investigators said. 
It ended at about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, when police stopped a car that matched 
descriptions given by witnesses.

FEDERAL GRAND JURY IN SAN DIEGO INDICTS SIX ON DRUG CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six people were indicted on drug charges by a federal grand jury in San Diego, 
the U.S. attorney's office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment unsealed Monday accused three of the defendants of providing 
laboratory supplies and chemical ingredients to their co-defendants, who 
allegedly used them to produce batches of methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
One of the defendants, Thomas M. Schultz, was the general manager of Chem Labs, 
a Placentia business that allegedly suppled chemicals and equipment to the ring 
and introduced methamphetamine "cookers" to people who could supply them with 
vital precursor chemicals, Assistant U.S. Atty. Amalia Meza said. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz, 32, is being held on separate charges in Yankton, S.D., Meza said. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged with supplying chemicals were Robert Grimsley, 33, of Ontario and 
George Khoury, 32, of Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Meza said Grimsley was arraigned in San Diego Monday afternoon on a charge of 
conspiracy to manufacture and possess methamphetamine and was lodged at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center on $150,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Khoury was a fugitive along with the other defendants; Jerry Barrow, 59, of Sun 
City and Robert Templeton, 55, and his wife, Judy, of Lihue, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants all are charged with conspiracy.

JUDGE TELLS FARMER TO STOP SELLING TREES AT COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Farmer Joe Cicero was ordered by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge Tuesday to 
stop selling Christmas trees from his popular fruit and vegetable stand at 
Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
Judge David P. Yaffe issued a preliminary injunction barring the sales because 
they were a "clear violation" of the agreement Cicero has with the college to 
sell produce he grows on 15 acres of Pierce land in Woodland Hills. Yaffe said 
campus administrators are entitled to prohibit the sales. 
</P>
<P>
Cicero's attorney plans to appeal the order, which is scheduled to take effect 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ruling, Cicero was in good spirits Tuesday. He said that even if he 
loses his appeal and is prevented from selling trees for the six days before 
Christmas, he considers his venture a success. 
</P>
<P>
Sales at the lot boomed this year as community members turned out to support 
Cicero, who characterized himself as David struggling against a Christmas tree 
Goliath -- competitor Stu Miller, whose company operates more than 50 lots 
around the state, including one across the street from the Cicero Farms stand 
at Victory Boulevard and De Soto Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in the history of Cicero Farms have we had sales like we have now," he 
said. "We have had so much community support it's unbelieveable." 
</P>
<P>
Cicero's problems began last year when Miller filed a lawsuit charging the Los 
Angeles Community College District with aiding unfair competition by letting 
Cicero sell trees without giving other tree dealers the opportunity to bid for 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
To settle the suit, district officials agreed to prevent Cicero from selling 
trees. The district believed that its agreement with him allowed the sale of 
products grown on the Pierce property. His trees were from the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
But Cicero disagreed with the college and began planning tree sales. Harold 
Kippen, Cicero's attorney, said the farmer had the right to sell trees and 
other products not grown on the property because his agreement with Pierce did 
not specifically prohibit such sales and because the college had allowed them 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have a right to sell those trees," Kippen said. 
</P>
<P>
The college took the issue to court in November. A Superior Court judge 
temporarily prohibited Cicero from opening his lot, but that order was 
overturned by an appellate judge pending a ruling on the college's request for 
a preliminary injunction. 
</P>
<P>
Yaffe said Tuesday that the college district did in fact have the right to 
prevent the tree sales "to protect itself from the potential liability" from 
Miller's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Cicero said the publicity he gained from his court battles enabled him to sell 
more than the 8,000 trees he originally ordered this year, and he recently 
received another order for thousands more. Even if he cannot sell them, he 
said, he has made enough in profits to pay for those trees. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been nothing but good for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jim Lynch, an attorney representing the college district, said that because 
of Cicero's defiance, district administrators may sever the agreement.

SPECIFIC PLAN FOR VENTURA BOULEVARD GETS TENTATIVE OK; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: A COUNCILWOMAN'S DECISION TO WITHHOLD HER VOTE DELAYS FINAL 
ACTION, MEANING THAT MORE PROJECTS COULD SQUEAK BY UNDER THE OLD RULES.

<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday gave tentative approval to a sweeping 
set of building rules for Ventura Boulevard aimed at controlling development on 
the San Fernando Valley's "Main Street" and generating the funds to cope with 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Initiated five years ago in response to an intense building boom, the so-called 
Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan will affect all 17 miles of the commercial 
corridor north of the Santa Monica Mountains. It will govern the size, height 
and uses of buildings from Studio City to Woodland Hills, and was designed to 
revive the small, service-oriented businesses that have been lost to glitzy 
shopping centers and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Described by officials as unprecedented in scope, the Specific Plan is expected 
to win final approval at the council's Jan. 4 meeting. Proponents had hoped 
that it would be adopted Tuesday, but Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores' decision 
to withhold her vote delayed final approval, prompting concerns that some new 
projects may be able to squeak in the door. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a triumph, not only to the people along the corridor but to the whole 
city," said Councilman Hal Bernson, who predicted that the plan may become a 
model for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth activists were less effusive, saying that in the five years it has 
taken to prepare the plan, the faces of their neighborhoods have changed and 
the quality of life has diminished, mainly because of large commercial projects 
and the resulting traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"In Encino, we've had nothing but runaway development, and it really should 
never have been allowed to occur from Day 1," said Kathy Lewis, vice president 
of the Encino Property Owners Assn. "I hope there's some hope for the other 
communities and that they might learn by the disaster that occurred in ours." 
</P>
<P>
"My hair was black when it started," Sherman Oaks resident Fred Kramer, who 
served on the plan's citizens advisory committee, told the City Council. 
"Today, it's gray. I urge you to pass this today before it turns white." 
</P>
<P>
The complicated ordinance addresses traffic, design and the environment, and 
cost the city about $600,000 in consultants' fees, Principal City Planner 
Robert H. Sutton said. Its preparation began in early 1986 with a panel of City 
Council-appointed homeowners and developers, and it received Planning 
Commission approval in March. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most significantly, the plan charges developers a fee for vehicle trips 
their projects will add to 
</P>
<P>
the congested boulevard -- money that the city will use to add traffic signals 
and widen streets. The "trip fees," already in use in some Westside coastal 
communities, will vary among each of the boulevard's five neighborhoods, 
ranging from $2,496 per added trip in Woodland Hills to $4,277 in Encino and 
Sherman Oaks. Trips are determined by counting cars that pass a certain point 
in an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also curtails development by placing a limit of 29,000 new car trips 
on the boulevard, now the site of 70,000 car trips per day. But if 12 crucial 
intersections are found to be seriously congested when 14,000 new car trips 
have been added, even stricter building controls will take effect. 
</P>
<P>
Building heights will generally be limited to two and three stories, although 
the City Council exempted four projects from the plan. These include two 
13-story office towers and one 10-story building planned for Ventura and 
Topanga Canyon boulevards in Woodland Hills, and a 335,000-square-foot office 
building at Ventura Boulevard and Hayvenhurst Avenue in Encino. Developers of 
those projects worked out prior agreements with the city. 
</P>
<P>
One project that was denied an exemption -- a controversial office and retail 
complex in Sherman Oaks -- may have indirectly prevented the Specific Plan from 
receiving final adoption Tuesday. The project, which could be three stories 
under existing rules but only two under the Specific Plan, is the focus of a 
neighborhood battle. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin M. Reznik, attorney for developer Jacky Gamliel, argued that his 
client deserved an exemption because Gamliel was on the verge of obtaining his 
building permits after 18 months of city review. Although Reznik failed to win 
an exemption, Flores and Councilman Robert Farrell said that they were 
concerned about builders with projects nearing approval and that it was unfair 
to subject them to a new set of rules. 
</P>
<P>
When the Specific Plan came up for a vote, Flores took the unusual step of 
withholding her ballot, thus preventing the ordinance from winning immediate 
adoption with the needed approval of 12 members. Tuesday's vote was 11 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing happened to an ordinance proposed by Councilman Michael Woo that 
would strictly limit building permits on the boulevard for as much as six 
months. Woo called for the modified building moratorium to give city officials 
a chance to study and implement the new Specific Plan. Despite the delay, the 
proposal is expected to win adoption Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
What remains unclear is whether Woo's building freeze will take effect 
immediately upon adoption Jan. 4 or a month later, when the Specific Plan goes 
into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners were disappointed when Flores and Councilman Ernani Bernardi voted 
against a plan by Woo that would have made the freeze effective immediately -- 
again forcing the issue to be decided Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems that Joan Milke Flores has jeopardized a lot of neighborhoods along 
Ventura Boulevard. We can now expect a rash of building permits to be requested 
before Jan. 4," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners 
Assn. "One person can do a lot of damage."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUSINESSES EVACUATED AFTER TANKS RUPTURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities in Lancaster evacuated a four-block area of commercial and 
industrial buildings Tuesday after construction workers ruptured two 
underground liquid storage tanks thought to contain gasoline, county fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses near Avenue J and the Sierra Highway were evacuated at 12:30 p.m. 
when workers installing city street lights hit the tanks, said Howard Spinrad, 
a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 businesses were evacuated, Sheriff's Lt. Dan Ridder said. It was not 
known how many people were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they believe that the liquid in the tanks is gasoline, but they 
were unsure because of the age of the tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The 350- to 450-gallon receptacles were buried 10 feet underground and may have 
been left behind by the operators of a gas station, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"It may have been a gas station in operation years and years ago, and nobody 
knew they were there," Spinrad said of the tanks. The tanks were believed to be 
40 to 50 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Evacuated workers were allowed to return about 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were investigating the incident.

BOY KILLED WHEN HIT BY CAR; BROTHER HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 7-year-old boy was killed and his brother was injured Tuesday night when they 
were struck by a car in the 800 block of Florence Street in Southeast San 
Diego, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Efren Perez, 7, and his unidentified brother were struck at 7:22 p.m. while 
playing with a skateboard in the street, Deputy Coroner Everett Mauger said. 
</P>
<P>
Efren, whose family lives in the 3800 block of Hemlock Street, was pronounced 
dead at the scene. His brother was taken to Children's Hospital in stable 
condition, Mauger said. The boys' father, Geraldo Perez, was taken to Sharp 
Memorial Hospital with chest pains, Mauger said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Police Sgt. Chuck Peck said the driver of the car appeared not to be 
at fault, although police suspect the driver was intoxicated.

ACTIVIST OPPOSES LICENSES UNTIL BUSINESSES USE ALCOHOL ABUSE PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like thousands of other Westside residents, Beverly Hills pediatrician Trisha 
Roth has discovered that the rejuvenated 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica 
now boasts a thriving night life and an impressive array of trendy restaurants 
and bars. 
</P>
<P>
Some restaurant and bar owners wish she had not. 
</P>
<P>
Roth has made a name for herself in her home city as a vigorous and sometimes 
strident opponent of alcohol abuse. She has campaigned before the City Council, 
school board and PTA for programs to prevent the serving of alcohol to minors 
and to discourage drinkers from driving. In her unsuccessful effort to win a 
seat on the Beverly Hills City Council earlier this year, an anti-alcohol 
message was a major component of her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she is branching out. In recent months, Roth has been raising objections 
before the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Department to liquor license 
applications from new Westside businesses, and she has paid particular 
attention to the three-block outdoor mall. 
</P>
<P>
The protests have forced the state agency to hold a hearing before granting a 
license, a process that can hold up a license for months. Roth does not 
withdraw her protests unless the applicants agree to implement programs 
encouraging responsible drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Her latest protest is over a liquor license sought by the Golden Monkey Cafe, 
which is scheduled to open in February on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard 
and 3rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
Roth says she is pleased that she has found a way to force establishments that 
seek liquor licenses to develop designated-driver programs, but she complains 
that some restaurants have gone back on their word and have done little or 
nothing to discourage drinking and driving once the licenses have been issued. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Falletta, a spokesman for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Department, said 
that new applications for full liquor licenses generally take about three 
months to approve but that a protest such as Roth's can extend the process to a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The state does not require licensees to have designated driver or server 
training programs, Falletta said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas H. Carroll, executive director of the Bayside District Corp., the 
nonprofit group that manages the Promenade, said most proprietors are 
responsible and have drunk-driving programs, although perhaps not at the level 
Roth would like. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said owners realize that the sale of alcohol is vital to the success of 
their businesses, and they do not want to risk losing their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said the idea of a coordinated designated-driver program for the 
Promenade will be among the items discussed at a meeting of proprietors this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dennis Zane, a force in the mall's renovation, said that he believes 
most proprietors are acting responsibly but that the city may be in a position 
to encourage more cooperation from licensees. 
</P>
<P>
Roth insists that she is not singling out the Promenade in her campaign. In 
fact, she makes protests most new license applications on the Westside. It is 
with the Promenade protests that she has managed to draw city officials and 
licensees into at least preliminary negotiations for a comprehensive policy for 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Roth says, ideally, she would want a highly visible program at every 
liquor-serving establishment and that every group of patrons has a designated 
driver. That person would wear a button and would be served free coffee or soft 
drinks. She said she would also like to see so-called notices posted at each 
table warning against the dangers of drinking and driving. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Larscheid, general manager of the Golden Monkey Cafe, said his 344-seat 
restaurant will have such a program in place for its late-February opening. 
</P>
<P>
Another Promenade restaurant, Chillers, has printed the phrase "Please don't 
drink and drive" on plastic cups that customers can take home. That was part of 
an agreement that owners had to make to get Roth to withdraw her protest of 
their liquor license earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Chillers, which attracts a college crowd, also provides a "party bus" on 
Tuesday nights to provide transportation for UCLA and USC students. 
</P>
<P>
Not all Promenade restaurant owners feel they have to go that far to promote 
responsible drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything we can do to make everybody safe is good, but I'm not going to make 
anyone wear a badge," said Jivan Tabibian, managing owner of Remi, a new 
Italian restaurant.

THIEF CUTS PHONE LINES

<P>
A thief scaled at least two 18-foot utility poles to steal 200 feet of 
telephone cable, cutting service Tuesday to 650 homes near Escondido, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell officials offered a $5,000 reward for information that helps 
authorities find the culprit, who was probably interested in selling the copper 
wire for scrap metal. 
</P>
<P>
At least 650 customers in rural subdivisions near Old Castle Road and Leisure 
Lane north of Escondido were left without service as a result of the theft. 
Most were in the 749- and 751- prefixes. 
</P>
<P>
Service was expected to be restored by the end of the day.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: BANACHOWSKIS ARE A FAMILY OF CHAMPIONS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amy Banachowski and Andy Banachowski are certainly not singing the holiday 
blues, but they've prepared themselves for what will likely be an anticlimactic 
Christmas. That's because within the past five weeks Andy, the women's 
volleyball coach at UCLA, and his daughter Amy, a freshman setter at UC San 
Diego, already received their ultimate gifts. 
</P>
<P>
The presents didn't come gift-wrapped, and they won't be taken for granted. 
But, as Andy said, "We can walk around all year now with a smile on our faces." 
</P>
<P>
The gift? National championships for both of them. 
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked UCLA routed Pacific, 15-9, 15-12, 15-7, Saturday to capture the NCAA 
Division I championship in College Park, Md., giving the elder Banachowski his 
fifth national crown since he started at UCLA in 1970. Nearly a month earlier, 
Amy led UCSD to its sixth NCAA Division III title in 10 years, defeating 
Washington University in five games. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Amy called her father in Washington, where the Bruins were in the 
midst of a Pac-10 road trip and said, "Dad, I've got mine. Now you've got to do 
it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Amy figured she could give her dad a little needling, knowing he could take it. 
UCLA (36-1) had spent most of the season at the top of the rankings and Andy, 
the dean of college coaches, has led the Bruins to a top-four finish or better 
in 17 of the past 20 seasons. During those times, Andy said, Amy was probably 
hanging around the gym, going unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't try to put too much pressure on me," Andy said. "She didn't try to 
lord it over me. But I could tell how happy she was to have won it." 
</P>
<P>
"I had to give him a little bit of a hard time," Amy said. "It was fun having 
the same kind of excitement at the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Amy's dad is arguably the best coach in women's collegiate history, with his 
646-140 cumulative record and .821 winning percentage in 24 seasons. UCLA was 
23-1 his first season. But the birth of Amy two years later ranks as one of his 
greatest successes. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Amy was unrecruited and apparently unwanted by any big school as 
she could do no better than third-string setter at state champion Mira Costa 
High. Amy, who is 5-feet-6, rarely played as she was overshadowed by all-state 
setter Piper Hahn (now at Stanford) and a second-string player that was much 
taller. 
</P>
<P>
So she took up Coach Doug Dannevik's offering to join Division III power UCSD, 
which entered the 1990 season without a setter and only one returning starter. 
Amy not only had an opportunity to play, but she won the starting position. 
And, culminating a most improbable season, it was Amy who led the inexperienced 
Tritons (37-8) to a 15-4, 13-15, 9-15, 15-8, 15-6 upset of Washington in the 
Division III final Nov. 17 in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"We could not have won the national championship if Amy had not played as if 
she was a junior or senior," said Dannevik, who realized early in the season 
that he had stolen a player with superior athletic ability and rare court 
savvy. "I just think she's a very talented kid with that knack that you can't 
coach. Very seldom did she make a mistake in a match." 
</P>
<P>
Because of their conflicting schedules, Andy was able to see Amy play just 
once. But throughout the season he received compliments from other coaches. And 
the one time he did see his daughter play, he wanted to approach it from a 
coach's perspective, not through a father's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a couple of situations where she could have made some ball-handling 
errors or not set to the right person," Andy said. "But she always made the 
right play. And she made some great plays. To see that really was a great 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Meeter Meter Running: Christian Heritage basketball center Rob Meeter is 13 
rebounds from becoming the Hawks' all-time rebounding leader. By the end of the 
season, he should have a comfortable cushion over record holder Will 
Cunningham, now a Hawks assistant coach. Cunningham, who played four seasons, 
finished last year with 678 rebounds. Meeter has 666. 
</P>
<P>
Meeter also entered the week ranked 20th in the NAIA in shooting percentage at 
.657. He leads Christian Heritage (3-8) in scoring with 12.8 points a game. But 
the fact that Meeter is leading the Hawks at all comes as a mild surprise. He 
stands just 6-6 and he is 29. 
</P>
<P>
Feather In His Cap: Grossmont College men's Coach Fred Featherstone, who has 
taught volleyball at every level except Division I, was recently selected as 
one of four coaches for the Olympic Festival in July. Featherstone will direct 
the month-long tryout and camp, coaching a Western Region team made up of 
college freshmen and sophomores at Loyola Marymount College. 
</P>
<P>
Featherstone, 44, who coached a group of San Diego high school boys to a 
surprising second-place finish in the 1990 Junior Olympics in July, said he 
didn't expect to be chosen but speculated that it might have been because of 
his enduring belief in the future of collegiate men's volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Said Featherstone: "Over time, it will be just as competitive as football and 
basketball."

BUTTS MIGHT STAY OUT FOR REST OF SEASON

<P>
Coach Dan Henning, concerned about the possibility of long-term problems to the 
injured foot of running back Marion Butts, said he might not play him for the 
remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said Butts was better Tuesday upon examination, but he said he has been 
advised that further activity may sideline Butts for an extended period of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a strained something in the foot," Henning said. "When they tell you this 
guy could be further injured to the point where you could lose him for a year, 
then you got something to think about. He's been arguably the biggest threat we 
have, and to lose him for a year would be foolish under these conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Butts is the NFL's leading rusher with 1,225 yards, and is being closely 
pursued by Detroit's Barry Sanders with 1,148 yards and Buffalo's Thurman 
Thomas with 1,143 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Butts wants to play," Henning said. "I told him that's going to be my 
decision. Whether he jumps on the table and wants to play and can run up and 
down the field, if I feel that's still a definite possibility that he can get 
hurt, then there's a good chance he won't play the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Rod Bernstine, who has been on injured reserve with a hamstring pull, has been 
the team's No. 2 rusher with 399 yards on 82 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it would be 90-10 we would probably activate Bernstine," Henning 
said. "We'll definitely start to practice him and see how he is before we use 
that move. If he's not 100 percent then we'll have to do something else." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers announced a five-year contract extension to the Noble Broadcasting 
Group and XTRA radio to broadcast games through the 1996 season. XTRA, which 
has broadcast the games the past four years, produces an eight-hour game day 
package for all 20 pre-season and regular-season games. T.J. SIMERS

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: CATLIN, MERTENS TO PLAY FOR SDSU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Catlin, a defensive back from Southwestern Community College, has signed 
a national letter of intent to play football at San Diego State next year, and 
Aaron Mertens, an offensive lineman from Kearny High, has orally committed to 
the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
Catlin, 5-foot-10 and 175 pounds, was named first-team all-Southern Division in 
the Mission Conference as both a defensive back and a kick returner. He had 12 
pass breakups and two interceptions last fall. He returned those interceptions 
a total of 150 yards -- one for a 100-yard touchdown and another for 50 yards. 
He also averaged 24.4 yards per kick return and 18.2 per punt return. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great cover guy," Southwestern Coach Bill Kinney said. "In our scheme, 
we use a lot of man-to-man coverage and combinations. When we used the combos, 
we usually left him by himself (in the coverage) and he did a great job all 
year long. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good tackler and a very aggressive defensive player." 
</P>
<P>
Kinney said Texas El Paso, San Jose State and Fresno State also recruited 
Catlin, who will enroll in SDSU in time for spring football. Catlin is a 
graduate of Sweetwater High School. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU has now signed two community college players for next season -- Catlin and 
Alex Semenik, a tight end from Scottsdale (Ariz.) Community College. Those are 
the two positions SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said at the end of the season that he 
wanted to fill with community college players. 
</P>
<P>
Mertens, a 6-6, 230-pound center, was named to the Los Angeles Times' 
all-county second team. 
</P>
<P>
"His work ethic is the No. 1 thing that stands out about him," Kearny Coach 
Willie Matson said. "He's the hardest-working kid we've ever had at Kearny." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mertens decided against officially visiting other schools, Matson said 
Mertens was seriously recruited by Arizona State, Cal, Washington, Washington 
State, Colorado, Colorado State, Oregon and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Matson said Mertens plans to sign a letter of intent on Feb. 6, the first day 
high school players are allowed to do so. SCOTT MILLER

<P>
THE FILM: "Hamlet," directed by Franco Zeffirelli and written by . . . well, 
you know. 
</P>
<P>
THE CLIFF NOTES REMINDER: Hamlet (Mel Gibson), the great and melancholy Dane, 
gets the word from the ghost of his father the king (Paul Scofield) that Uncle 
Claudius (Alan Bates) murdered Dad and married Mom (Glenn Close). Paralyzed by 
inaction -- this is not "Lethal Poignard II" -- his grip on love and self go 
down the drain, and just about everybody dies. 
</P>
<P>
THE LOOK: Nothing so trendy as to make you snatch up your credit card and head 
for Melrose yelling, "I've got to have that.' Understandably. Someone or 
other's been putting clothes on these people for almost 400 years. The costumes 
are unobtrusive -- this isn't MTV style over substance -- yet are not lost in 
the spaces they had to occupy. Italian designer Mauricio Millenotti has 
costumed films, including the Zeffirelli/Shakespeare "Otello," opera, 
television and ballets and has a command of the grand scale. Remember, "Hamlet" 
as a story was 12th-Century ancient history when Shakespeare did it in the 
17th, and he had some costuming anachronisms of his own, like a reference to 
"chopines," platform shoes unknown in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
The Clorox factor is more than apparent. The principals' clothes tend to suffer 
by their incredible Hollywood tidiness, less suggestive of the 12th or even 
17th Century than a modern-day Maytag side-by-side. There is the antiseptic 
sheen of a '40s MGM spectacular where even the horses' teeth looked like they 
had been capped. Compare it to Kenneth Branagh's wonderfully grimy film version 
of "Henry V," released here last fall. The tons of coal dust spread over 
Hamlet's castle for authentic weathering never touched its big-name residents. 
At least Ophelia (Helena Bonham-Carter) and Hamlet get more disordered-looking 
as their minds do. (Look for Hamlet in the library, in a scruffy sweater and 
throwing his boot.) 
</P>
<P>
THE SUPERB: With the exception of one Gertrude (Close) headdress that looks 
like a brain-stem injury surgical restraint, the jewelry and adornments are 
marvelous, particularly the Celtic-looking wrought cloak clasps. The crowns, 
rough and heavy jeweled bands, are absolutely on-11th-Century target, evoking 
the oldest surviving crown in Europe, of the Empress Kunigunde of Luxembourg. 
Gertrude's shoulder-duster earrings are pure Visigoth. Now you might see these 
turn up on Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
THE SILLY: Gertrude's blond Viking braids, which look like they were extruded 
from a butterscotch Dairy Queen machine. And one unfortunate aqua surcoat that 
looks exactly like my mother's chenille bedspread. 
</P>
<P>
THE CREDIBLE: The authentic reliance on knits, embroidery and worked adornment 
for ornamentation. Ophelia in simple, virginal cream-colored smocks is in 
deliberate, unsubtle contrast to the bright colors of Gertrude's ardent 
newlywed sexuality, turquoise and wine reds. And, of course, Hamlet's raiment 
is a fixed point of almost unrelieved black, a color in great vogue among 
Elizabethans. Gibson has a modern face, and there are moments when, in 
leggings, boots, a leather jerkin whose big, loose stitches cry out "olde," he 
could sit down front at a Madonna concert without turning too many heads. 
</P>
<P>
THE SOURCES: Less likely to catch on as street-style than, say, "Dick Tracy," 
even if there were such a boutique as "Thor's Threads" to handle this line. But 
it's like Mrs. Roten told us in 10th grade English -- you're supposed to listen 
to this. PATT MORRISON

A CHILLING LOOK AT THE KING OF THE ARCTIC; 
</P>
<P>
WHITE BEAR; ENCOUNTERS WITH THE MASTER OF THE ARCTIC ICE BY CHARLES T. FEAZEL 
HENRY HOLT$22.50, 240 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"When the watchdog growls at the door, someone's coming," goes the conventional 
wisdom of the Arctic. "When it hides under the table, look out for bears!" 
</P>
<P>
We are offered this ominous advice by Charles T. Feazel in "White Bear," an 
intimate account of Ursus maritimus, a creature that most of us encounter only 
in the sterile confines of a zoo. 
</P>
<P>
The book is an irresistible armchair adventure, a natural history of the 
Arctic, an anthropological study of its native peoples, and -- above all -- a 
fascinating collection of the lore and legend of the polar bear. 
</P>
<P>
"Always, it seems, the bear is waiting," Feazel writes. "Throughout the 
centuries there have been only three constants in the Arctic: the white and the 
cold and the bears." 
</P>
<P>
Feazel, a geologist by training and an adventurer at heart, encountered the 
polar bear during various expeditions in the polar region. 
</P>
<P>
At an average weight of 1,000 pounds, he tells us, the polar bear is the 
largest predator on earth. A polar bear may stand taller than 10 feet, with a 
reach of 14 feet, and it can easily outrun a person through ice and snow. 
</P>
<P>
And a polar bear, so cuddly in appearance, will eat almost anything, from 
rodents to stranded whales -- even its own young: 
</P>
<P>
"In mute testimony to this natural process," Feazel writes, "tiny claws of cubs 
are sometimes found in polar bear droppings." 
</P>
<P>
The great beast is both a living creature and a totem of immense potency to the 
native dwellers of the Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
"Nanook," as the bear is known, "was clearly the most powerful element in the 
lives of such people," Feazel explains. "He determined the patterns of their 
lives and often the circumstances of their death. Awesome and awful, he 
possessed a majesty innately worthy of worship." 
</P>
<P>
What impresses Feazel most, however, is the marvelously utilitarian design and 
function of the polar bear's anatomy. Tooth, bone, fur and blubber have evolved 
into an ideal technology for survival in the Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the polar bear is so well-suited to the frigid temperatures of the 
polar winter that its greatest peril is heat and hunger in summertime: "A polar 
bear may have to live for half a year without a meal during the ice-free 
season," Feazel explains, "when he can't hunt effectively." 
</P>
<P>
The polar bear is still hunted by the native peoples of the Arctic, but -- as 
Feazel warns -- the real enemies of "Nanook" are the intrusions of the modern 
world into the once-pristine environment of the Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the polar bear is at risk from chemicals and heavy metals in the food 
chain, the detritus of oil drilling (and oil spills), and even the threat of 
global warming. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Feazel reminds us that the most urgent threat of all are poachers and 
pampered tourists armed with high-powered rifles: Shooting is still the most 
frequent cause of death among polar bears. 
</P>
<P>
Feazel never strays far from hard science, and his prose is only rarely lyrical 
or rhapsodic. But he cannot resist the temptation to anthropomorphize the polar 
bear. 
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly depicts "Nanook" in human-like postures: "Picture a flamboyant 
prizefighter, arrogant in his heavy fur coat, mugging for the camera." He 
speculates that bears kill more prey than they can eat for "the sheer pleasure 
of the kill." 
</P>
<P>
And Feazel, an earnest and good-natured storyteller, is not above a pun. "The 
end of this tale," he quips, after a top-to-bottom inventory of the polar 
bear's anatomy, "is the end of the tail."

PRIEST ELECTED IN HAITI REMAINS IN SECLUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON A. SCHANCHE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the leftist Catholic priest who won Haiti's 
first fully free democratic election Sunday, remained in seclusion Tuesday, 
still a mystery to diplomats, political observers and others who wonder where 
he plans to take the strife-torn, impoverished country. 
</P>
<P>
The mild-mannered, 37-year-old pastor to the poor campaigned on a vague 
platform extolling Haitian self-sufficiency and promising justice, food and 
jobs to his followers. But he never specified how he would manage the country 
to achieve his goals. 
</P>
<P>
The fiery sermons that gave Aristide a messiah-like aura to millions of 
Haitians during the years that he preached against electoral politics were 
often anti-American, anti-capitalist and sometimes fell barely short of calls 
for violence against the country's conservative establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always the workers against the boss with no shades of gray in between," 
said a senior Western diplomat. "Now if he wants the country to run, he's going 
to have to work with the bosses." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to Haitian political veterans, is that the often 
mystical Aristide, a specialist in liberation theology, has been so far removed 
from the political and economic life of the country that he has little to work 
with in shaping an administration that can re-organize and run the Haitian 
bureaucracy and control the largely undisciplined army. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither Aristide nor the mixed team of advisers around him have any background 
in government," said a diplomat. "They range from the extreme left, including a 
Communist Party founder, to liberal civic activists -- teachers, neighborhood 
civic leaders, people with no background in management." 
</P>
<P>
But to Aristide's followers and a few outsiders who have talked to him since 
his landslide victory Sunday, the ascetic priest has appeared open to hearing a 
range of opinions as he begins organizing a transition team to take power after 
the presidential inauguration Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams appeared confident that Aristide will succeed in 
forming a stable government and has recommended that Washington offer as much 
assistance as it can. 
</P>
<P>
"We will try to be helpful, but the decision rests in Washington and Congress," 
Adams said in an interview Tuesday. "We are going to make an effort to 
significantly increase what we can do for Haiti. I have recommended that." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aristide's headquarters accepted the army's denial that its soldiers 
or police had shot and killed a pregnant woman during a massive victory 
celebration for the popular priest Monday. While many people claimed to have 
witnessed the incident, independent foreigners who examined the body said their 
were no gunshot wounds and it appeared more likely that she had been run over 
by a vehicle.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE DIDN'T DO ANY WAXING, HE GOT WAXED

His team lost to Houston on Sunday, and Kansas City reserve running back Todd 
McNair covered a lot of ground. 
</P>
<P>
Running downfield in the third quarter as a member of the Chiefs' kickoff team, 
McNair was sandwiched between two Oilers. He suffered a mild concussion and lay 
unconscious on the turf for several minutes while team officials huddled over 
him. Finally, he was led to the sideline in a wobbly state. 
</P>
<P>
And in his native state, New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, McNair told Doug Tucker of the Associated Press: "I was dreaming. I was 
back home in Jersey with my girl. I was waxing my car down, and then I was 
driving my car. It was warm. The windows were down." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Kansas City, it remained cold and rainy. 
</P>
<P>
Add dream state: Said McNair: "They said I came off smiling and telling people 
I was going back in. But I don't remember any of that. I got to the sideline 
and I saw the players and the fans and I thought, 'Hey, I'm dreaming that I'm 
in a game.' " 
</P>
<P>
Team officials said McNair will be able to play Sunday at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Said McNair: "Everybody was shook up and scared, but today they're joking. 
They're calling me 'Sleepy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Was he scared? 
</P>
<P>
Said McNair: "I wasn't scared because I wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Name the only team to lose two games and be ranked No. 1 in the AP 
college football poll. 
</P>
<P>
New help: After the Dodgers introduced Bob Ojeda and Brett Butler at a news 
conference Monday, Orel Hershiser recalled a conversation he'd had with his 
6-year-old son, Quinton, during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hershiser: "I picked up the paper and said, 'Gee, we got Butler.' Quinton 
said, 'Why do we need a butler? We already have a live-in.' " 
</P>
<P>
Junkyard Dogs: Before the recent Georgia-Georgia Tech game, Tony Barnhart of 
the Atlanta Journal and Constitution asked Georgia's athletic director and 
former football coach, Vince Dooley, to describe his "funniest memory" of the 
rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
Dooley recalled that in 1966, a group of Georgia fans brought a cannon to the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
With Georgia trailing, 7-6, Bulldog kicker Bobby Etter was about to make 
contact on the conversion attempt when the cannon went off, distracting him. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia won, 23-14, but Dooley recalled: "It was the first extra point he had 
missed all year. The next day those fans buried that cannon in the 
Chattahoochee (River). We never had any thought of having a cannon here again." 
</P>
<P>
Bring on Trottier: No self-respecting hockey fan will believe this, but Lemieux 
is having a great year. 
</P>
<P>
The horse, Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-year-old colt named for Pittsburgh Penguin star Mario Lemieux, the two-time 
NHL scoring champion, won the $5,000 Open Invitational Trot at the Meadows 
harness racing track near Washington, Pa., Sunday night. It was his second 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
That makes six victories in 21 starts. Meanwhile, the horse's namesake 
continues to recover from a back infection that has kept him out of action. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Minnesota, in 1960. The Golden Gophers, declared national 
champion before the bowls, lost to Washington in the 1961 Rose Bowl and 
finished 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Philadelphia 76er forward Charles Barkley, 27, when asked about 
Boston's aging front line of Larry Bird, 34, Kevin McHale, 33, and Robert 
Parish, 37: "I'd rather have older guys who are great players than younger guys 
who stink." TED BROCK

They ought to penalize Andre Agassi by making him play tennis tournaments 
instead of banning him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
With all the quarterbacks going down these days, what was the purpose of 
keeping Joe Montana on the field in the closing moments of a game San Francisco 
was winning, 26-10? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' 2-6 home record isn't the worst in club history. They were 0-7 at the 
Coliseum in 1962, the year they went 1-12-1 and Bob Waterfield was replaced by 
Harland Svare in midseason. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Wonder how much those Georgia Frontiere autographs will be worth in five years. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
I still don't know how Henry Ellard held onto the ball after taking a Ronnie 
Lott kind of shot from Dave Waymer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Rams and 49ers proved that NFL games can last 3 hours 8 minutes even 
without a lot of instant replay reviews. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One reason it's easier to win on the road in football than in basketball is 
that football officials aren't swayed so much by crowds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The way Frank Gifford talks about Southern California, you would never know 
that he was raised in Bakersfield and played for USC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a quiet way to celebrate New Year's Eve, tune in the 
Rams-New Orleans game on ABC. . . .

The Raiders should give their "Commitment to Excellence" award to Howie Long 
for the first time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No list of NFL coach-of-the-year candidates would be complete without Art 
Shell. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tim Belcher is expected to be at full strength for the opening of the season, 
meaning the Dodgers will be less tempted to rush Orel Hershiser back into the 
starting rotation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Just how good is Greg Smith, the young second baseman the Dodgers acquired from 
the Chicago Cubs? Some people think he's ready to start for most teams that 
don't have Ryne Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
But Baseball America rated him only the seventh-best prospect in the Cub farm 
system. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New Dodger publicist Jay Lucas has named his temporary office in a trailer, 
"Deals on Wheels." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Another Brett Butler plus is that he hit nearly as well against left-handed 
pitching (.302) as against right-handed (.313) last season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Something is wrong with the system when Ken Griffey is making more money than 
Ken Griffey Jr. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Dan Reeves and sportscaster Ed Arnold. . . .

<P>
Nevada Las Vegas and Princeton, who play tonight, have at least two things in 
common: They're unbeaten and nationally ranked. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas is the only school that has both men's and women's basketball teams

<P>
Lloyd Arnold, president and co-owner of Los Alamitos Race Course, is a finalist 
for the Proximity Award, which recognizes contributions made to harness racing.

<P>
Lee Trevino's decision to leave NBC for the senior golf tour was much wiser 
than John Brodie's. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The bad news out of those Coliseum remodeling discussions was that the Raiders 
and Trojans probably will have to play somewhere else for two seasons instead 
of one. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim is closer to landing an indoor soccer franchise than a hockey or 
basketball team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Scott Davis has become a common name in sports. There are the Raider defensive 
lineman, the 800-meter runner, the pole vaulter, the tennis player, and the 
10th man on Virginia's basketball team. . . .

SCHVANEVELDT HAS THE FINAL WORD

<P>
Trainer Blane Schvaneveldt triumphantly chewed his gum and displayed rare 
emotion Saturday night in the winner's circle at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
The usually stoic conditioner had won the Champion of Champions quarter horse 
race with Dash For Speed for an unprecedented fifth time but this one was 
special. 
</P>
<P>
Schvaneveldt, a 56-year-old Idaho native, did not become the all-time leader at 
Los Alamitos by second-guessing his program. Despite two disappointing efforts 
by Dash For Speed before the $250,000 race, Schvaneveldt calmly maintained that 
nothing was wrong and his confidence never wavered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great feeling," said an animated Schvaneveldt. "This one is greater 
because this mare was beaten twice, and everybody said she was done and we 
shouldn't have brought her back. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been training good all the time but didn't get away in her last two. 
Nothing was wrong with her but it was hard to convince her owners she was just 
losing her back end. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of pressure but pressure doesn't bother me. I like pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I never changed one earthly thing since I got her this summer. When you go to 
changing, you get beat! 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the toughest field they've assembled but when she breaks in 
front, it takes a good horse to beat her." 
</P>
<P>
Said co-owner Bobby Blakeman, "Blane's got to be the king. He can get a horse 
ready for a race like this better than anybody."

Added jockey Kip Didericksen, "I told the pony boy going to the gate that I was 
the winner. I loped her one lap around a week ago Friday, and it was the best 
she ever tracked. She's just been going good, and I liked the hole she drew 
(No. 7) and the way the race set up." 
</P>
<P>
Although she was the top money-winner in the lineup and was being trained and 
ridden by meet leaders, Dash For Speed was dismissed at 8-1, the 
seventh-longest price in the extremely competitive 10-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
Texan Blakeman, who owns the mare in partnership with Colorado cattleman Tom 
Bradbury, said Dash For Speed has been retired and will be vanned to his 
253-acre mare care center 40 miles from Ft. Worth this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to let her be a mommy," said Blakeman, who hopes to select a daddy 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
The owners enjoyed the best of both worlds with her this year, racing her in a 
bid for world champion honors while a recipient mare carried her first foal 
after an embryo transplant in April. 
</P>
<P>
The practice is illegal in thoroughbred or standardbred racing but common in 
the quarter horse industry. The foal, by Streakin Six, is due in March but Dash 
For Speed will carry her own future foals. 
</P>
<P>
Blakeman credited a medicine to correct a thyroid deficiency in helping her as 
both a racehorse and mother. 
</P>
<P>
"She had no energy and her metabolism was down so we gave her the powder the 
last two weeks to get her count back up," Blakeman said. "We had a hard time 
getting her in foal at the beginning of the year too. We gave her the powder 
and right away got an egg." 
</P>
<P>
The American Quarter Horse Assn. will send out ballots to its 63-member racing 
committee in early January to determine the world champion. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we have the good fortune of being chosen," Blakeman said after the 
mare's 22nd victory in 30 starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I like that she's won 10 Grade I stakes, three more than anybody else. She has 
won three Grade I races this year, and has career earnings of $1.2 million 
without ever winning the All-American Futurity. She set a track record winning 
the Anne Burnett and a stakes record winning the Los Alamitos Championship this 
summer. And she got rid of the myth that she could only win in New Mexico and 
couldn't run at night." 
</P>
<P>
History leans in Blakeman's favor. Eleven of 18 winners of the Champion of 
Champions have gone on to be named world champion, including five of the last 
six. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos' off-track business continues to grow. Canterbury Downs in 
Minnesota and Les Bois Park in Idaho joined the network last month. 
</P>
<P>
"The Capital District of New York, with 53 locations, should be next," James 
Smith, executive vice president of the track, said. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, we'll look to Montana and Mexico. When we hit $710,000 off-track 
on Breeders Classic night (Nov. 17), I thought that would be high for the meet. 
But we've gone over $750,000 since, and it looks like we'll hit $800,000 soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 50 satellites now and will have 100 within two years," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos officials are trying to stage a $100,000 winner-take-all match 
race between quarter horse Griswold and thoroughbred Valiant Pete on Jan. 11 or 
12. Griswold set a world record of :44.07 for 870 yards this month. Valiant 
Pete set a world mark of :49 1/5 for 4 1/2 furlongs (990 yards) this year. 
Griswold, Gold Rush Derby winner Genuine Article and Breeders Marathon Classic 
winner Six Figures are expected to head the lineup Friday in the $25,000 
Katella Handicap at 870 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Harris, tied for sixth in the trainer standings with 13 victories, may 
be in limbo for several weeks, since stewards barred him from entering horses 
last week. A urine sample on Mighty Dasher, which finished fifth in the 10th 
race Nov. 8 when Harris trained him, tested positive for cocaine. Harris 
requested that the second part of the split sample be sent to another lab, in 
this case Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. Stewards said they will schedule a 
hearing when they obtain the result. Harris' previous record is clean. 
</P>
<P>
Harness driver Billy Myer, who died in Delaware last week at 74, won the 
American Trotting Classic at Hollywood Park in 1970 and '72 with Dayan. He also 
won several major stakes in the 1960s with star pacer Romeo Hanover. . . . Dare 
You To, runner-up in the American Pacing Classic at Los Alamitos and 
fourth-place finisher in the Breeders Crown Aged Horse Pace, will become the 
first North American horse to compete in New Zealand's grueling Inter-Dominion 
Championship in March. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Lee Roy Heidelberg, who saddled runner-up Tee Roy Reb in the Champion 
of Champions, managed a farm for actor Robert Mitchum in Atascadero from 
1972-79. . . . Trainer H.L. Hooper, whose favored Heisajoy was bothered by 
chain-reaction interference and finished sixth (placed fifth), refused to make 
excuses after the Champion of Champions. "The mare was the better horse 
tonight," said Hooper. 
</P>
<P>
Trials are scheduled tonight for the $500,000 Golden State Futurity, the 
richest race of the meet, Dec. 29.

BUCKS PASS PISTONS, 106-101 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Chuck Daly of the NBA champion Detroit Pistons thought he had an idea for 
getting his club out of its worst slump in three years. 
</P>
<P>
He had his team, which has shot poorly almost all season, come out firing at 
Milwaukee Tuesday night, imitating a tactic that has worked for the Chicago 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons jumped in front, 17-6, in the opening minutes, but couldn't handle 
the long-range shooting of Jay Humphries and Ricky Pierce, losing again, 
106-101, to the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee, the only team unbeaten at home, improved to 13-0 there, and 
stretched its lead in the Central Division to 2 1/2 games over the slumping 
Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third loss in a row for Detroit and the seventh in the last eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Humphries had 13 of his career-high 36 points in the fourth quarter when the 
Bucks outscored Detroit, 32-15, in the last 9:31 to pull it out. Pierce came 
off the bench to get 12 of his 24 in the closing rally. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dumars had 19 points and James Edwards had 18 for the Pistons, but neither 
scored in the fourth quarter. Edwards missed the previous loss with a pulled 
muscle in his rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to show patience to get out of this slump," Daly said. "I thought this 
was the one, but then we flopped in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a position to drop out of the race. We need a win." 
</P>
<P>
They will try to end the slump against Chicago tonight in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 96, Houston 95 -- The two great centers, David Robinson and Akeem 
Olajuwon, battled almost to a standstill. But Robinson enjoyed the meeting at 
Houston most, because his two free throws with 23 seconds left decided the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson had 18 points and 13 rebounds. Olajuwon, the Rockets' star, had 20 
points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon had two chances to be the hero. He had a 10-foot shot with eight 
seconds left and it rimmed out. Then his driving layup at the buzzer was short. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon, a six-year veteran, indicated before the game that he felt Robinson, 
a second-year man, still needed to pay some dues. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 122, Golden State 94 -- With Clyde Drexler getting 10 points in the 
first quarter, the Trail Blazers took a 35-9 lead. They continued to build on 
that, and by a minute into the second half it was 74-38. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved Portland's record to 22-2, best in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 112, Miami 103 -- The Bulls failed to get off to their usual fast start 
at Chicago, so Michael Jordan had to play more for his team to win its third in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
It was the eighth loss in a row for the Heat, but Miami challenged the Bulls 
throughout.

Jordan played 36 minutes and scored 39 points, 24 in the second half, to hold 
off the Heat. Scottie Pippen made 11 of 17 shots, including a three-pointer, 
and finished with 30 points in 41 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 114, Dallas 95 -- The Suns stretched their unbeaten string since Xavier 
McDaniel joined them to six games. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel had 23 points, but it was Dan Majerle, coming off the bench for 24, 
who led the romp at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Already missing their big man, Roy Tarpley, for the season, the Mavericks lost 
Herb Williams for at least five games because of sore knees. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 105, Charlotte 100 -- There isn't a team that enjoys playing against Karl 
Malone. The Hornets really hate it. 
</P>
<P>
Malone had 30 points and 17 rebounds as Utah won at Charlotte. In seven 
previous meetings with the Hornets, the Mailman averaged 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 122, Orlando 105 -- The game was delayed almost an hour at Seattle 
because the Magic was snowbound two miles from the Coliseum. Attendance was 
listed as 1,568. Six inches of snow fell in the afternoon and early evening, 
and traffic was stalled. The SuperSonics sold more than 10,000 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick McKey had 33 points for the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento 108, Minnesota 99 -- Anthony Bonner scored five of his 18 points in 
a 9-2 run late in the game at Sacramento to assure the Kings their third win in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings improved to 6-15, despite losing guard Bobby Hansen with a bone chip 
in his left ankle. DAN HAFNER

NEGOTIATING STRATEGIES IN KIDS' STYLE WARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Most preteen girls who shop at the Kids Mart in Burbank stop cold when they see 
a certain outfit: a simple black dress with a matching jacket. Store manager 
Jocelyn Neris said she hears many girls beg their parents to buy the suit for 
holiday parties. 
</P>
<P>
But the adults usually say no. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the style, which is unadorned except for four gold buttons on the 
jacket. "It's not the price," said Neris, who considers it a bargain at $23.95. 
"It's the color." 
</P>
<P>
An all-black outfit for a preteen doesn't win the hearts of mothers and fathers 
-- even at holiday time. Such clothing disputes span the seasons, of course. 
But they seem to peak during December, when parents must judge what is 
appropriate to wear to holiday get-togethers and to give as Christmas or 
Hanukkah gifts. 
</P>
<P>
According to parents, children and salespeople, here are the items kids want 
most and parents like least: 
</P>
<P>
* All-black outfits. 
</P>
<P>
* Bart Simpson T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
* Tights topped with miniskirts or long, loose-fitting tops ("dress-blouses"). 
</P>
<P>
* The pricey ($95 and up) PUMP line of Reebok kids' basketball shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Disputes about these items can transform the jolliest soul into a Scrooge. 
Salespeople -- the childless ones, anyway -- can pop an aspirin and forget 
about it the minute they lock up for the day. But parents may be faced with 
sullen silences or incessant begging for hours or days on end. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, such disputes are part and parcel of growing up, mental health 
experts say. They are, in fact, a sign of normal, healthy development. 
</P>
<P>
"About 40% of the teens and parents I see have some sort of issue with 
clothing," said Dee Shepherd-Look, a Woodland Hills psychologist who 
specializes in treating children and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the warfare, whatever the season, is the child's attempt to become 
an individual, said Dr. Alan Sandler, director of child psychiatry at Pine 
Grove Hospital and Mental Health Center in Canoga Park. It's a paradoxical 
process, Sandler acknowledges. "In becoming his own person, the child often 
wears the same uniforms as everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
The development of distinct clothing tastes -- even though they may be a carbon 
copy of a best friend's -- reflects a child's growing independence, said Gary 
Alan Fine, professor of sociology at the University of Georgia, Athens. It 
means a child is "moving away from the family as the center of his existence" 
and learning to reach out to peers. "That can be threatening to parents," Fine 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But compromises over clothing disputes are possible, according to experts. Some 
parents agree, and describe the compromises they've made that keep the whole 
family happy -- or at least on speaking terms. 
</P>
<P>
Pat and Gary Emery of Los Angeles, for instance, set a $50 limit when their 
11-year-old son Zack needs a new pair of athletic shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything above that, he can come up with the difference," explained Pat Emery. 
</P>
<P>
When Marcia and Carl Skolnik's daughter Jessica, a seventh-grader, wanted black 
tights with lace trim and a "baby-doll" dress, the parents balked, reasoning 
that it looked too seductive. The neckline was much too far off-the-shoulder 
for Marcia's taste. So the Burbank parents compromised: "She can wear the 
off-the-shoulder baby doll top and tights to school as long as she wears a 
turtleneck underneath," Marcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who don't like the tights-with-miniskirt look often talk their 
daughters into wearing longer skirts, salespeople say. 
</P>
<P>
And those who balk at the popular all-black dress in Kids Mart often persuade 
their daughters to choose a similar style with a black-and-white polka dot top 
instead, Neris said. Parents say it looks more childlike. 
</P>
<P>
Parents in the midst of wars over Bart Simpson shirts often give a go-ahead to 
some of the "milder messages" as a compromise. Or, salespeople say, they talk 
their offspring into a shirt with a Raiders or other sports team logo. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents admit they just give in -- budget allowing -- and buy whatever 
clothing their offspring want. Some reason that's more economically sound over 
the long term. Why buy a shirt your child hates, for instance, only to have it 
hang in the closet until his arms grow longer than its sleeves? 
</P>
<P>
Other parents don't cave in to a child's every clothing whim. But they are 
reluctant to impose too many restrictions on clothing purchases, fearful of 
repressing their child's need to express individuality. Pat Emery has this 
guideline for her son, who wears school uniforms all week: "If the clothes he 
wants say, 'I'm cool' or 'I'm different' I allow them. If they seem to say, 
'I'm dangerous' or 'I'm sexy' I won't allow them." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Cagle, a West Los Angeles free-lance writer, follows much the same 
philosophy with his daughter Heather, 7. "A child's clothing is a way of 
expressing herself," he say. He is liberal, with two exceptions: "If she wants 
to wear something that's inappropriate for the weather -- like sweat pants to 
the beach in July -- or if I think her attire is inappropriate for the 
occasion, like wearing her jams and pink tank top to a wedding." 
</P>
<P>
Understanding the dynamics behind a child's particular wardrobe wishes can help 
parents decide when to refuse, when to compromise and when to give in. 
</P>
<P>
Young fans of black clothing may be trying to look sophisticated, or may be 
working their way through a rebellion phase. "Black clothing is 
anti-authoritarian, because it started out as punk attire," said Shepherd-Look. 
But all-black attire for children strikes fear in some parents, said 
Shepherd-Look, because many equate it with the occult, gangs, witchcraft and 
heavy-metal rock groups. 
</P>
<P>
Bart Simpson fans are probably snarling their way through rebellion, too, said 
Shepherd-Look, who is also a professor of psychology at Cal State Northridge. 
The Simpson shirt messages (such as "I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?") 
express an inner child we all have, Shepherd-Look said. "And it's more socially 
acceptable, in my opinion, to wear a Simpson shirt than to say 'bleep-bleep' to 
a teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Girls who ask for tights paired with an oversize, loose-fitting "baby-doll" 
style blouse may be torn between their wishes to stay a child and society's 
pressure to grow up and to look seductive. "The look is a contrast," 
Shepherd-Look observed. "The top is very childlike and feminine, loose-fitting. 
The tights are very sexual." 
</P>
<P>
PUMP fans enjoy a pretty transparent fantasy, said Walter Woods, an Atlanta 
psychologist and consumer research consultant. They can be airborne. They can 
be a great basketball star. They can be the next Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"One fundamental fact about kids and dress is their desire to be affiliated 
with a particular team or individual, a hero of some sort," Woods said. But 
kids offer other reasons as well. Wearing PUMP shoes, they say, is bound to 
impress classmates simply because they are new and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most tuned-in parents might experience a guilt trip on the heels of a 
shopping trip. "We remember the battles we had with our own parents, over such 
fashions as bell-bottoms and miniskirts," Fine said. "On one hand, we want to 
give in and say what we wish our parents would have said. But then practicality 
sets in. And we begin to understand where our own parents were coming from."

What Would Herman Say?: Patrick Lilley, the actor who played Eddie Munster in 
the television series "The Munsters," pleaded innocent Monday to charges that 
he robbed his limousine driver outside a suburban gas station near Chicago. 
Lilley, 37, who used the stage name Butch Patrick in the hit series, was in 
Chicago making appearances at Halloween parties and signing autographs when the 
alleged robbery occurred. BETH KLEID

Mass MOCA Nixed: State planning officials in Massachusetts have vetoed a 
proposal to use state money to turn a vacant electronics factory into the 
world's largest contemporary art museum. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis was one of the 
strongest backers of the proposed $77-million Massachusetts Museum of 
Contemporary Art, or Mass MOCA. Last week, the state museum commission approved 
a scaled-down version of Mass MOCA, but on Monday the revised proposal was 
rejected. BETH KLEID

Excommunication: A Greek Orthodox bishop excommunicated director Theo 
Angelopoulos as work on his latest film started in Florina, Greece, under heavy 
police guard Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Augustinos Kandiotis called "The Suspended Step of the Stork," a 
$3.3-million production starring Marcello Mastroianni, unpatriotic and 
anti-church. Kandiotis, who campaigns against sexual freedom and women smoking, 
said that Angelopoulos and his crew were excommunicated for four years. 
Angelopoulos has won awards at the Cannes, Venice and Berlin film festivals.

A Kickoff and an Infirmity: CBS announced that "Good Sports," starring Farrah 
Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal, will replace "Doctor, Doctor" on Thursdays at 9:30 
p.m. "Doctor's" last house call will be Jan. 3, but CBS officials said the show 
will probably return in March. "Good Sports" is about a relationship between a 
former supermodel making a career as an anchor at an all-sports network, and 
her new co-anchor, a former pro-football player. BETH KLEID

'ALMOST' IS ALMOST A GOOD FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Almost an Angel" (citywide) might just as well be called " 'Crocodile' Dundee 
Gets Religion." As amiable as ever, lean and leathery Paul Hogan plays a career 
criminal and electronics wizard who, fresh out of prison, assumes a hilariously 
precise Willie Nelson impersonation and knocks over a bank. Before he can do a 
repeat performance, this time disguised as Rod Stewart, he instinctively rushes 
into oncoming traffic to shove a toddler to safety. 
</P>
<P>
The next thing Hogan knows he's up in the clouds being interviewed by the Big 
Probation Officer in the Sky, played to perfection in his silvery Moses mane 
and beard by an unbilled Charlton Heston. In a stroke of inspiration, Hogan -- 
who is the film's writer as well as its executive producer -- keeps us guessing 
whether he has actually died or has just dreamed he did, but fails to make 
anything of the dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, after a lively and imaginative start, the film is downhill, a treacly 
business about how Hogan, now on the lam, lands in Fillmore, where he comes to 
the rescue of the dying young operator (Elias Koteas) of a recreation center 
for latch-key kids and his acerbic sister (Linda Kozlowski). Koteas and 
Kozlowski are likable, but their roles are pretty thankless. 
</P>
<P>
The chronic dearth of family films, plus Hogan's undeniable laid-back appeal, 
may work to the film's advantage over the holidays, but "Almost an Angel" 
really belongs on the tube. It was produced and directed with warmth and 
efficiency by John Cornell, who produced Hogan's Australian TV programs and 
created with Hogan the Australian Tourist Commission's celebrated advertising 
campaign for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
To the filmmakers' credit they fill the film's countless small roles with 
numerous minority actors and with such seasoned veterans as Doreen Lang (as 
Koteas and Kozlowski's mother), Parley Baer and Hank Worden. "Almost an Angel" 
(rated PG but G is more like it), which is enlivened by Maurice Jarre's 
helpfully melodramatic score, is in the Christmas spirit but is a 
disappointment in the wake of the "Crocodile" Dundee movies.

How many seasonal songs are enough? At what point does the Christmas cup 
overflow? These questions presented themselves when an At My Place one-night 
stand was presented by Inner Voices. 
</P>
<P>
These women, singing mainly a cappella but occasionally backed by one or two 
taped instruments, have become identified with Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Ames, who organized the quartet, and her colleagues -- Carmen Twillie, 
Darlene Koldenhoven and Clydene Jackson Edwards -- have set their careers as 
busy studio artists. Only at this time of year is their almost magical blend 
put on public display. 
</P>
<P>
Singing material from their recent Christmas album last Wednesday, they 
communicated as tellingly as ever their stunning musicianship, whether applied 
to standards ("Silent Night," "Ave Maria"), one or two originals (Koldenhoven's 
"The Angels Sing") and new lyrics by Ames to traditional songs. 
</P>
<P>
Twillie's deep contralto and Koldenhoven's celestial soprano stood out among 
many delights. Yet as the hour wore on, the inescapable fact became clear: This 
repertoire is by definition self-limiting. Many of the lyrics tell a single 
story in different words; the melodies tend to harmonic monotony. The 
seldom-heard verse to "White Christmas" is surprisingly amateurish. 
</P>
<P>
Inner Voices should not allow its glorious groove to become a rut. What's 
needed is material that will enable these artists to spread their capacious 
wings in songs that can remain valid from January through November. 
</P>
<P>
Inner Voices will be heard Thursday at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks, (818) 986-2662.

'DOLL': MESSAGE OF CLEAR-EYED HONESTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" sets the mood for Elizabeth Iannaci's one-woman show 
"O Beautiful Doll," at Harman Alley Theatre in Hollywood, and later she even 
sings her own clever lyrics to that classical bit of musical elan. Joy is not 
her message -- clear-eyed honesty is. 
</P>
<P>
Honesty ties together the portraits in Iannaci's gallery of women who haven't 
totally broken down the ramparts of liberation, whether social or personal. 
Each one is a reminder that liberation is a unique battle in every case. 
</P>
<P>
The most together of Iannaci's characters is single mother Maddy, warm, 
intelligent and in control. Her several appearances are brief hints of sanity 
in a less-than-sane world -- until she finds herself on the witness stand, that 
is, stunned by the demeaning questions put to her by a rapist's female 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Maddy's solidity weaves in and out of other likenesses: Cherry, a 
self-constructed bimbo whose mother helped in the construction, auditioning as 
a performing telegram; Roxy, a tough showbiz type who describes nights scoping 
a band her boss wants to sign, and whose sexy dress causes this career girl too 
many problems; and Layla, a nice person who after a bad experience in a girlie 
bar, trades it for a worse one as a nude "figure model." They're touching and 
sad, these women who didn't notice liberation passing them by. 
</P>
<P>
Less successful as a portrait is Nora, a Southern type, marinating her nails at 
a beauty parlor. She blandly describes her failed attempt at murder, and later 
plays with the bullet holes in the kitchen wall remembering how easy it was. 
Nora would be more effective without the accent and the Southern address. Least 
worthy is Iannaci's couple of minutes with Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
Iannaci's writing benefits from Peter Flood's intelligent direction. As an 
actress, she also benefits from a tendency toward intriguing understatement. 
What keeps her from being as powerful as she could be is a lack of energy 
onstage, energy that film could provide through close-ups and quick cuts, but 
which the actress herself must provide live. 
</P>
<P>
"O Beautiful Doll," Harman Alley Theatre, 522 N. La Brea, Hollywood; Thursday 
and Jan. 10, 8 p.m. $12.50; (213) 466-1767. Running time: 50 minutes.

SWAT team freed him from a cell where he was being held hostage. Houston was 
treated for minor injuries after being held by Ernest Olivo Cruz and Jose

COURTROOM SEARCH EXCESSIVE, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County Municipal Court judge who ordered spectators in his courtroom 
to be searched for weapons and their names checked for outstanding arrest 
warrants was operating outside the court's security policy and this type of 
search should not occur again without reasonable cause, county officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting earlier this week, County Counsel James McBride and Sheriff's 
Cmdr. John Kingsley assured county prosecutors and public defenders that mass 
courtroom searches, such as the one ordered by Judge Steven E. Hintz on Nov. 
15, will not be repeated without reasonable cause. 
</P>
<P>
Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman said he is satisfied with reassurances from 
McBride and Kingsley, who oversees court security, that mass searches of 
spectators will not be done without cause and that mass warrant checks probably 
will never be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
Clayman said his office has withdrawn its request for a Superior Court order 
forbidding such procedures in light of the officials' agreement not to allow 
unjustified searches. 
</P>
<P>
"Those things that we sought to clarify. . .have been completely remedied by 
this particular agreement," Clayman said. "We're very pleased with it and I 
hope the public will feel safer, too." 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 15, Hintz ordered bailiffs to lock Courtroom 12, use hand-held metal 
detectors to search about 20 courtroom spectators for weapons and check their 
names against court records for outstanding arrest warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Five days later, Clayman's office petitioned the Superior Court to order the 
Municipal Court to refrain from repeating the procedure, and to show reasonable 
cause before conducting any searches in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But the courtroom search policy has not changed, even though the dispute has 
been settled, McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
"The sheriff has reviewed his policy and basically is stating that. . .searches 
will be done on a reasonable cause or suspicion-type basis," McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the search Hintz ordered, McBride said, "I think Ken Clayman admits it 
was outside the policy and it probably was somewhat different from the policy." 
</P>
<P>
But McBride said the policy has never been spelled out in detail because court 
and sheriff's officials prefer to govern their security procedures by following 
the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which forbids illegal searches. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than establishing a fine, hard line on what's allowed and what isn't 
allowed, we're going to look at things on a case-by-case basis," McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant County Counsel Noel A. Klebaum said it is extremely unlikely that 
courtroom spectators will be checked en masse for outstanding warrants ever 
again, although individual spectators could be checked if court or security 
officials deem it necessary.

L.A. COUNTY: THE SUPERVISORS SPLIT 3 TO 2 OVER DIGRE RUNNING THE TROUBLED 
AGENCY. BOARD HEARD TESTIMONY FROM A GRANDMOTHER UPSET WITH HIS HANDLING OF A 
FLORIDA CASE INVOLVING ABUSE VICTIM WHO DIED.

By a split 3-2 vote in closed session, Los Angeles County supervisors decided 
Tuesday to hire the No. 2 man at Florida's statewide health services agency to 
take over the troubled Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
The vote to hire Gerald Peter Digre as the department's director followed a 
public hearing that included dramatic, surprise testimony from the grandmother 
of a 2-year-old boy whose death generated widespread criticism of Florida's 
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. 
</P>
<P>
After the testimony, Supervisor Ed Edelman -- who has been extremely vocal in 
his opposition to Digre -- told his colleagues he had learned new information 
about Digre that he wanted to share during a closed session. The vote followed. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman dissented, as did Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who said he was persuaded by 
Edelman that Digre's demanding management style would not work well in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Edelman called a news conference to express "strong 
displeasure" -- not only at the appointment of Digre, but also at the way he 
was hired. The supervisor complained that the executive search firm that 
selected Digre as a finalist failed to disclose any negative information about 
him. Edelman also voiced displeasure that his colleagues did not make an effort 
to find a candidate on whom they could all agree. 
</P>
<P>
"My concerns were sort of brushed aside," Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana said Digre was "the best candidate we interviewed." 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich praised his "excellent credentials." 
</P>
<P>
Digre, 46, is currently the No. 2 man at the Florida Department of Health and 
Rehabilitative Services, a sprawling state agency that is responsible for a 
variety of health services, including those to abused and neglected children. 
The agency has been harshly criticized in recent years, and Edelman cited this 
criticism -- as well as complaints from those who worked for Digre -- in 
opposing the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Digre said he was "very conscious" of the split among 
the supervisors, adding: "I just can't wait to get there and start the process 
of building that place and make all five board members proud of the results." 
</P>
<P>
Since its director resigned in July, the Department of Children's Services has 
been undergoing a massive state-ordered reorganization. Investigators found, 
among other problems, that social workers routinely failed to visit the 
children they supervise and that county officials permitted children to remain 
in foster homes where they had been abused. The department serves 55,000 abused 
and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
Digre, who said he will assume the $115,000-a-year post Jan. 2, was expected to 
be confirmed publicly at Tuesday's board meeting. The vote was delayed after 
the testimony of Mary Rae Coe, a Long Beach woman who is the grandmother of 
Bradley McGee, perhaps Florida's most well-known victim of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Coe held back tears as she told the board of how she called a Florida child 
abuse hot line five times to report that Bradley was being abused by his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing was done," she said bitterly. "Now he's dead." 
</P>
<P>
The child was sent back from a foster home to his mother and stepfather, who 
killed the boy in July, 1989, by repeatedly dunking his head in a toilet and 
beating him with a wet pillow. The case led to the conviction of a social 
worker on charges of neglect and caused changes in Florida law, adding $13 
million annually in child welfare funds.

MAYOR BRADLEY SNUBS MOLINA, BACKS TORRES IN SUPERVISOR RACE

Snubbing a City Hall colleague, Mayor Tom Bradley on Tuesday endorsed state 
Sen. Art Torres for Los Angeles County supervisor from a field of nine 
candidates that includes Councilwoman Gloria Molina. 
</P>
<P>
Torres' campaign advisers said the endorsement would carry weight not only in 
Los Angeles city neighborhoods that make up about one-fourth of the new 1st 
District, but in other communities as well. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who don't live in the city who think Tom Bradley is 
their mayor," said Dee Dee Myers, spokeswoman for Torres, a Los Angeles 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Molina sought to turn Bradley's support of Torres to her advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Bradley demands an absolute kind of loyalty, and that is something I don't 
provide to anyone," she said. "I have enjoyed my independence on the council." 
</P>
<P>
Molina said she did not seek Bradley's endorsement, but conceded that it would 
help Torres. The councilwoman questioned the extent of the help, contending 
that the mayor's popularity has declined because of his political problems. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said the mayor's endorsement "means that I can get along with people at 
every level of government." 
</P>
<P>
Molina and Torres are seeking to become the county's first Latino supervisor 
this century in the Jan. 22 election. Other candidates include state Sen. 
Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) and Sarah Flores, a former aide to Supervisor 
Pete Schabarum. The new district was carved out by a federal judge who ruled 
that the old district lines denied the county's 3 million Latinos political 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said his endorsement came as the result of a long friendship with 
Torres. 
</P>
<P>
"He and I have been friends and mutual supporters," the mayor said. "I've known 
him for almost as long as I've been in politics. I admire him for his vision 
and for his courage and for his creativity. . . . I believe that he will bring 
to the board progressive, forward-thinking ideas and the ability to make 
friends and to work together with the city." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Molina, Bradley said: "I'm here to support Art Torres, not to talk 
in a negative fashion about any other candidate."

THREAT OF SUIT DELAYS COUNTY TAX; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: SUPERVISORS HOPE FOR AN AGREEMENT WITH MCA TO HEAD OFF A COURT BATTLE 
OVER A 2% LEVY ON AMUSEMENT PARKS. THE FUNDS WOULD GO TO MENTAL HEALTH 
PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Threatened with a lawsuit by MCA Inc., owner of Universal Studios Hollywood, 
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday postponed to Jan. 8 its 
vote on a 2% tax on amusement park receipts to generate money for county mental 
health programs. 
</P>
<P>
But the board approved ordinances for unincorporated areas of the county, 
increasing the hotel and motel occupancy tax from 10% to 12% and imposing a 5% 
tax on users of gas, electric and telephone utilities. Both take effect Jan. 1. 
The utility tax is expected to generate $14.3 million by the end of the fiscal 
year, and the occupancy tax would contribute another $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors hope to negotiate an agreement with MCA that will head off a 
lengthy court battle over the amusement tax. But if that does not work, board 
Chairman Mike Antonovich said he has a substitute tax measure on the agenda for 
Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The substitute tax would claim 10% of the gross revenues of landfills in the 
unincorporated areas, and would raise about $5 million by June 30, the end of 
the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Even if one of these taxes is approved, some programs still would require 
consolidation, but no patients would be abandonned, mental health officials 
said. Without the new taxes and other measures to divert money to mental 
health, 27,000 of the county mental health system's 58,000 patients would have 
been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
The amusement tax would generate about $4 million, and would apply to Universal 
Studios and Magic Mountain, the only amusement parks in the county's 
unincorporated areas. The county's taxing authority extends only to those 
areas. Cities already impose many of these taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Citing MCA's threat to challenge the tax ordinance in court, the supervisors 
put off their vote until the next board meeting. At that time, they also will 
consider the substitute landfill tax. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Antonovich, sponsor of all the tax ordinances, said he hoped to 
gain MCA's cooperation by tacking a clause onto the amusement tax that would 
eliminate it by July 1, 1991. Antonovich said he hoped that such a clause might 
persuade MCA to lend its muscle to lobbying the state for the county's full 
share of mental health funding. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Gov. George Deukmejian cut $71 million in state mental health aid 
to counties, precipitating the crisis in Los Angeles County's mental health 
system. 
</P>
<P>
MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg declined to comment on the supervisors' move, 
and a company spokeswoman responsible for theme park matters failed to return 
numerous calls to her office. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which includes Universal Pictures, has been in the news recently 
because of its agreement to be purchased by Japan's Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co. for $6.59 billion. 
</P>
<P>
While it is unlikely that the Matsushita sale influenced MCA's decision to 
threaten court action against the supervisors, the company has a reputation for 
litigiousness. Sheinberg has been widely credited with once saying that he 
viewed corporate litigation as a "profit center." 
</P>
<P>
Even if all the taxes are approved, the mental health department still will be 
about $2 million short of what it needs to maintain current programs. The taxes 
plus countywide belt-tightening measures and money transfers approved two weeks 
ago would raise about $23 million; the department said it needed $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
So Mental Health Director Roberto Quiroz has come up with a plan of program 
curtailments and consolidations to address the shortfall. On Tuesday, he sought 
the supervisors' permission to begin imposing the measures, but the board 
delayed action on them for 30 days to give the department, mental health 
advocates and clinic administrators more time to analyze the program changes. 
Several people, including Richard Van Horn, chief executive officer of the 
County Mental Health Assn., complained that the department's plan was made 
available only last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would close six clinics run by the department, four staff office 
buildings and three programs run by private facilities under contract to the 
Department of Mental Health. About 3,320 patients would have to transfer to 
other programs. The department, meanwhile, could save close to $1 million on 
rent and other overhead costs, Quiroz said. 
</P>
<P>
County-run treatment facilities that Quiroz wants to close include the 
Metropolitan State Hospital at Norwalk, Compton Mental Health Center, Crescenta 
Valley Mental Health Center, San Fernando Mental Health Center, San Pedro 
Mental Health Center and South Bay Mental Health Center in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Also slated for elimination are three outpatient mental health programs for 
children and adolescents run by private facilities under contract to the 
county. They are located at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, St. John's 
Hospital in Long Beach and at Stirling Academy in Reseda.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KCET CALLS CHALLENGE TO LICENSE 
'PREPOSTEROUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A conservative media watchdog group's challenge to Los Angeles public 
television station KCET's broadcasting license is "preposterous," station 
executives said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee on Media Integrity, chaired by conservative author David 
Horowitz, filed the challenge Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The organization asked that the FCC not renew KCET's license until the station 
appoints an ombudsman, restructures its board of directors and holds more open 
board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
KCET spokeswoman Barbara Goen said station officials believe that Horowitz and 
attorney Richard Perkins, secretary of the watchdog organization, are 
retaliating against KCET for its refusal to acquiesce to their requests for 
more conservative programming. Horowitz said that the call for an ombudsman and 
an elected board was in the interest of all viewers, not just conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KCET said Tuesday that it has decided to renew the beleaguered news 
magazine "South Africa Now" through April. Beginning this week, the station 
will label it "point of view." It will be the only program on Channel 28 to 
carry such a label.

STRAWBERRY SEASON OFFICIALLY OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's time for the red and green signs of Christmas: boughs of holly, bunches of 
poinsettias and baskets of strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
While the rest of the country is dreaming of a white Christmas, Ventura County 
is dotted red with its first strawberry crop of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Oxnard Strawberry Festival and Miss Oxnard, official 
hostess of the annual event, gathered at Kotake &amp; Sons Farm in Camarillo on 
Tuesday to help pick the first ripe berries. The only person not particularly 
thrilled with the trays of strawberries was Cliff Kotake, one of the owners of 
the farm. "You tend to get a little sick of strawberries after all these 
years," said Kotake, 34, whose father started the business more than 20 years 
ago. But his 4-year-old nephew, Tachi Shudo, enjoyed taste-testing the riches 
of the family business. 
</P>
<P>
The Camarillo farm is usually the first in the county to pick the crop, said 
Tsujio Kato, festival chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was first held eight years ago, the festival has grown "too successful 
to accommodate the large crowds," Kato said. So this spring, the event will be 
moved to College Park by Oxnard College, which is twice the size of the former 
site at Channel Islands Harbor, Kato said. 
</P>
<P>
The festival will retain the same format, he added, but now there will be more 
space for parking, plus additional vendors and arts and crafts displays. MAJA

BILL BOYARSKY: RIGHTS ISSUE: IT'S QUALITY, NOT RACE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Several weeks have passed since Judge Greg O'Brien decided that the 1st 
District supervisorial race was no place for an O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
He pulled out of the election after federal Judge David V. Kenyon drew new 
boundaries to assure the election of a Latino. Kenyon ruled that the Board of 
Supervisors in 1981 had created districts deliberately designed to split the 
Latino vote and weaken Latino political power. An appellate court upheld his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
The lines shifted east, away from O'Brien's Glendora home, to neighborhoods 
with many more Latinos. O'Brien looked at the Latino-dominated demographics, 
added up his campaign debt of $101,000 and decided on the comparative security 
of the Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, I drove to the Pomona courthouse to have lunch with him. He'd been a 
decent, intelligent candidate with a positive campaign. You don't find too many 
of those in politics and so I was anxious to renew our acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation turned out to be more than a pleasant swapping of campaign 
stories. The judge brought up a difficult, complex subject, something I often 
hear when talking about the 1st District race with Anglos: Why must a Latino 
area be represented by a Latino, or Latina? Isn't that ethnic gerrymandering? 
</P>
<P>
I remember a discussion I had with a group in the San Fernando Valley, which 
demanded an answer to that question. After all, some said, a white man, 
Supervisor Kenny Hahn, has provided parks, swimming pools, clean streets, a 
hospital and health clinics to his predominantly black South L.A. district. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien put it this way: 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I found troubling . . . is the notion that ethnics ought to be 
represented by ethnics . . . I think that is ultimately destructive to our 
society because they're going to be looking at each other and ourselves in 
terms of where our ancestors lived rather than in terms of neighbors and 
friends and co-workers and fellow Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother is married to a Korean girl. My other brother's wife is of Hispanic 
ancestry. . . . At a time when we are achieving the American dream of the 
melting pot and of assimilation, all of a sudden, minority and ethnic 
leadership finds it necessary to regroup and restructure and I think it's 
divisive and I think it is potentially dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
I replied that the supervisors weren't being exactly colorblind when they 
created the district. "The argument was made during the case, and accepted by 
the judge and, later, by an appellate court, that the board's white majority 
did take into consideration ethnic factors," I said. The court found the 
supervisors split the Latino vote to protect white incumbents. That, Judge 
Kenyon ruled, violated the Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, splitting up any kind of community deprives the residents 
of political power. One of the most notorious examples of that occurred in the 
San Fernando Valley communities of Encino, Sherman Oaks and Studio City. All 
are upper-middle-class areas that reach up into the Santa Monica Mountain 
foothills from Ventura Boulevard. All have the same political agenda, including 
growth control along the boulevard and protection of the hillsides from 
overdevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
To save incumbents' jobs, the Los Angeles City Council divided the areas among 
three council districts, represented by council members who lived on the other 
side of the Santa Monica Mountains. That weakened the City Hall influence of 
Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
You can see what this means in county government by looking at the old 1st 
Supervisorial District, represented by Pete Schabarum. There were some poor 
neighborhoods in that district, but the voting strength was the middle-class 
and upper-middle-class suburbs of the eastern San Gabriel Valley. These were 
the constituents to whom the conservative Schabarum has been most responsive. 
That's why he was so often accused by representatives of the poor of neglecting 
county health and social services. 
</P>
<P>
The new 1st District contains many more poor neighborhoods than the old. One of 
their common interests is improving county health care, heavily used by the 
impoverished residents. The new supervisor, fearing defeat, presumably will not 
neglect these poor people. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, that supervisor could have been an O'Brien. Despite the judge's 
misgiving about ethnic politics, he might have put together a coalition of the 
substantial number of white voters in that district, combined with Asians and 
even some Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
But if O'Brien had won, he couldn't have survived as another Schabarum. He 
would have had to fight for more health care for the poor. He would have had to 
represent the poorer constituents. Quality of representation -- and not race -- 
was why Judge Kenyon created the new 1st District.

OXNARD OKS $75,000 FOR EFFICIENCY STUDY; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: CONSULTANTS WILL BE HIRED TO ANALYZE A $330,000 AUDIT THAT 
RECOMMENDED TRIMMING 103 POSITIONS. 
</P>

<P>
As part of a multifaceted plan aimed at cutting costs, the Oxnard City Council 
agreed Tuesday to spend about $75,000 on consultants to find ways to improve 
efficiency at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The council also unanimously approved a proposal by City Manager Vernon Hazen 
to spend about $56,000 for a word processing center that Hazen said will save 
the city money in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the financially beleaguered city spent $330,000 on a management 
audit that was also designed to identify ways to make City Hall operate more 
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
City officials defended the additional spending, saying the efforts ultimately 
will save the city money. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, in order to save money you have to spend money," Councilman Michael 
Plisky said. 
</P>
<P>
Hazen said the audit completed in June by Cresap Management Consultants of 
Washington, D.C., provided good ideas on how to improve efficiency. But he said 
the additional studies by consultants are necessary if specific money-saving 
plans are to be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
The Cresap audit "pointed me in the right direction, but now I need more 
information," Hazen said. 
</P>
<P>
The audit said that the city can eliminate 103 city positions, including 30 in 
the Police Department, seven in the Fire Department and 43 in the Public Works 
Department, and still improve city services. The recommended reductions are 
designed to save the city $3.5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
However, most city department heads criticized the audit, saying most of the 
recommended staff cuts would drastically reduce city services. 
</P>
<P>
The council also decided Tuesday to build no new parks until the council can 
find a way of financing their maintenance. But officials said the city will 
complete parks already under construction. 
</P>
<P>
At Hazen's request, the council agreed to form several committees to study ways 
to improve the city's financial condition. One committee is to review ways to 
increase revenue through additional utility, towing and franchise fees. The 
committees are to include council members, city employees and residents. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to pay a consultant about $35,000 to review the cost-cutting 
recommendations that Cresap made for the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Hazen told the council that Cresap did not provide enough justification to cut 
30 positions from the department. He said he believes an outside consultant 
should study whether such staff cuts would greatly reduce police services. 
</P>
<P>
"In developing a long-term financial strategy, it is important to have an 
accurate staffing plan for the Police Department," Hazen said in a council 
report. "This is why I think it is imperative that we have further study." 
</P>
<P>
Cresap also recommended that Oxnard review its operation of the city's 
community center and auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
At Hazen's request, the council agreed to consider forming a nonprofit 
corporation and a board of directors to operate the two facilities, which would 
take the burden off the city. Hazen suggested that the corporation also operate 
the Carnegie Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Hazen said it will cost about $25,000 to have a consultant study the 
feasibility of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The council also agreed to spend $15,000 to have a consultant review the city 
process used to issue development permits. 
</P>
<P>
"The main purpose of an outside consultant is to provide some element of 
outside fresh viewpoints but also to assess the need for additional training in 
subjects such as how to work more effectively with customers," Hazen said in 
his report.

POLICE IDENTIFY BODY FOUND ON ROADSIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
The body found on the side of California 33 north of Ojai was identified as 
that of a 26-year-old North Hollywood woman who was strangled with some type of 
cord, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose name was withheld pending notification of relatives, died of 
asphyxiation, coroner's Investigator Jim Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
The autopsy revealed no signs of sexual assault, Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. 
Joe Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to tell where the woman was killed, Harwell said. There was no 
sign of struggle in the area where the body was found, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that her body was dumped off the side of the road after dark Sunday 
night, Harwell said. The woman's killer probably intended the body to roll 
farther down the embankment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman had been dead 16 to 17 hours before her body was spotted by a 
Sheriff's Department employee transporting inmates to the Rose Valley Work Camp 
about 10:40 a.m. Monday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was identified through fingerprints registered with the U. S. 
Department of Justice, Harwell said. CAROL WATSON

FIRM MUST PAY $317,000 TO SETTLE BIAS LAWSUIT; 
</P>
<P>
DISCRIMINATION: APARTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY IS ALSO ORDERED TO HAVE EMPLOYEES 
TRAINED TO COMPLY WITH CIVIL RIGHTS AND HOUSING LAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the area's largest apartment management companies has been directed to 
train its employees to comply with civil rights laws and prohibit housing 
discrimination as part of a $317,000 settlement of a lawsuit alleging prejudice 
against blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Leon Savitch issued the order Monday against 
Beaumont Property Management Co. Inc., which operates about 10,000 apartments 
in about 250 buildings throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the nation's largest injunction" in a housing discrimination case, said 
Patrick O. Patterson, western regional counsel of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People's Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which 
represented the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
The monetary compensation is the second largest in a housing discrimination 
suit, Patterson said. The largest, $450,000, came in a February settlement of a 
case involving a black airline employee who was rejected as a tenant at a 
Westchester apartment complex. That settlement also was negotiated by the legal 
defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
Beaumont has faced three other housing discrimination complaints, including one 
last year that resulted in the firm having to pay $20,000 in damages to a 
racially mixed couple. The company's executive vice president, Gary Holme, is 
president of the Los Angeles Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent lawsuit, filed in April, 1989, was triggered by Nathan Beams, a 
52-year-old executive with a title insurance company, who is the son of a black 
man and a white Jewish woman. 
</P>
<P>
Beams moved to Southern California from Oakland in 1988 and answered a 
newspaper advertisement for a one-bedroom, furnished apartment at Casa Verde, a 
complex in Encino near his office. 
</P>
<P>
He made an appointment with the manager over the phone, but said that when he 
arrived, dressed in a business suit, he was told all apartments were rented. 
Four days later, he saw another ad for Casa Verde. He said in an interview that 
he identified himself over the phone and was told again that there were no 
vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, 'Why wouldn't they rent to me? I hope it wasn't because I 
was black,"' he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he said, he was visiting his rabbi. The rabbi sent a white woman 
to the building as a prospective tenant. She returned with an application and 
the manager's business card. She had been told the rent was negotiable and that 
the apartment could be occupied immediately, Beams said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was appalled. I was shocked, even though I'd suspected it," Beams said. 
</P>
<P>
When he was a teen-ager, Beams said, neighbors had offered to buy out the 
family after his father had built a house in a white community in Sacramento. 
His father refused, Beams said, and, more than 30 years later, "I felt that 
this was my time. I felt that I had to do something." 
</P>
<P>
Beams contacted the Fair Housing Congress of Southern California, which sent 
its own test applicants to the building. 
</P>
<P>
One was Marcella Dix-Brown, the anti-discrimination group's executive director, 
who is black. Dix-Brown said that when she asked to see the apartment, the 
manager told her it had just been rented. Twenty minutes later, Dix-Brown's 
white assistant was offered a unit at the complex. 
</P>
<P>
In all, six blacks received "significantly differential treatment" than whites 
at seven Beaumont buildings and one that had been formerly operated by the 
firm, but was not at the time of the test, according to the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The building managers involved are still employed by Beaumont, said Gregory M. 
Bergman, an attorney for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"There might have been a misunderstanding, but there was definitely not 
discrimination," he said. "Beaumont has fired managers in the past for 
discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed on behalf of the Fair Housing Congress, Beams and the five 
black testers by the legal defense fund and the private law firm of Morrison 
&amp; Foerster. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement money will go to the six individual plaintiffs, the Fair Housing 
Congress and to pay attorneys.

U.S. DESIGNATES WATTS TOWERS A LANDMARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles' Watts Towers, the soaring spires Sabato (Sam) Rodia spent more 
than 30 years building, have been declared a national landmark, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rodia, an unschooled Italian immigrant, used pliers, a hammer and wire clippers 
to build what critics regard as an act of visionary architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Once threatened with demolition, the structures at 1765 E. 107th St. are now 
undergoing extensive restoration. Watts Towers' designation as a national 
landmark will qualify it for various federal funds and private grants it may 
not have been able to attract before, said John Outterbridge , director of the 
Watts Towers Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
"We here on site are very happy," Outterbridge said. "We always felt that the 
Watts Towers, like the Watts community, has been nationally prominent for many, 
many years. Residents of this community who have been caretakers (of the 
towers) for years are due just this kind of prominence." 
</P>
<P>
The designation of the Watts Towers as a national landmark by Secretary of the 
Interior Manuel Lujan Jr. increases the focus on the structures "as a national 
treasure," Outterbridge said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodia's hand-made masterpiece is an amalgam of broken bottles, pottery shards, 
seashells and bits of iron held together by chicken wire smeared with ordinary 
builder's cement.

TEACHERS, DISTRICT AGREE ON PAY HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ojai teachers settled for a conditional 6% raise, half the increase they sought 
in March, after the union and school officials agreed to use a new negotiating 
technique, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai Unified School District board approved a three-year contract Tuesday 
for 210 full- and part-time teachers in two high schools, a middle school and 
five elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It was probably the most positive experience I've ever had in salary 
negotiations for 17 years," Assistant Supt. Leo Molitor said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with the settlement," said Ronnie Rodriguez, president of 
the Ojai Federation of Teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for a 4% pay hike retroactive to Aug. 28. Another 
retroactive 2% hike will take effect Feb. 1 if this year's student enrollment 
continues to be at least 190 students more than last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The March proposal was taken off the table when we went into collaborative 
negotiations," Rodriguez said of the new discussion method that the union and 
district agreed to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a problem-solving approach where both parties agree to look at 
the issues and see what's best for the district," said Bill Purdom, district 
negotiator. "It raised the trust level significantly." 
</P>
<P>
District administrators and another 160 employees will also receive a 6% pay 
hike, with 2% of it contingent on enrollment figures through January. 
</P>
<P>
The increases will largely be funded by state money for student enrollment, 
Molitor said. The district's enrollment of 3,573 students jumped to 217 more 
than last year, the largest increase the district has experienced in 10 years, 
he said. THIA BELL

NEW HEAD OF CHILDREN'S SERVICES HIRED IN SUPERVISORS' SPLIT VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a split 3-2 vote in closed session, Los Angeles County supervisors decided 
Tuesday to hire the No. 2 man at Florida's statewide health services agency to 
take over the troubled Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
The vote to hire Gerald Peter Digre as the department's director followed a 
public hearing that included dramatic, surprise testimony from the grandmother 
of a 2-year-old boy whose death generated widespread criticism of Florida's 
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. 
</P>
<P>
After the testimony, Supervisor Ed Edelman -- who has been extremely vocal in 
his opposition to Digre -- told his colleagues he had learned new information 
about Digre that he wanted to share during a closed session. The vote followed. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman dissented, as did Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who said he was persuaded by 
Edelman that Digre's demanding management style would not work well in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Edelman called a news conference to express "strong 
displeasure" -- not only at the appointment of Digre, but also at the way he 
was hired. The supervisor complained that the executive search firm that 
selected Digre as a finalist failed to disclose any negative information about 
him. Edelman also voiced displeasure that his colleagues did not make an effort 
to find a candidate on whom they could all agree. 
</P>
<P>
"My concerns were sort of brushed aside," Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana said Digre was "the best candidate we interviewed." 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich praised his "excellent credentials." 
</P>
<P>
Digre, 46, is currently the No. 2 man at the Florida Department of Health and 
Rehabilitative Services, a sprawling state agency that is responsible for a 
variety of health services, including those to abused and neglected children. 
The agency has been harshly criticized in recent years, and Edelman cited this 
criticism -- as well as complaints from those who worked for Digre -- in 
opposing the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Since its director resigned in July, the Department of Children's Services has 
been undergoing a massive state-ordered reorganization. Investigators found, 
among other problems, that social workers routinely failed to visit the 
children they supervise and that county officials permitted children to remain 
in foster homes where they had been abused. The department serves 55,000 abused 
and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
Digre, who said he will assume the $115,000-a-year post Jan. 2, was expected to 
be confirmed publicly at Tuesday's board meeting. The vote was delayed after 
the testimony of Mary Rae Coe, a Long Beach woman who is the grandmother of 
Bradley McGee, perhaps Florida's most well-known victim of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Coe held back tears as she told the board of how she called a Florida child 
abuse hot line five times to report that Bradley was being abused by his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing was done," she said bitterly. "Now he's dead." 
</P>
<P>
The child was sent back from a foster home to his mother and stepfather, who 
killed the boy in July, 1989, by repeatedly dunking his head in a toilet and 
beating him with a wet pillow. The case led to the conviction of a social 
worker on charges of neglect and caused changes in Florida law, adding $13 
million annually in child welfare funds. 
</P>
<P>
Coe contacted Edelman after reading newspaper stories about Digre's possible 
selection for the county job. The supervisor asked her to attend Tuesday's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Her voice quavering, Coe complained to the supervisors that Digre had stated 
publicly that her grandson's death was "a question of probability" and that an 
agency as large as his would inevitably make "errors of judgment."

MIKE DOWNEY: RAMS NEED TOUGHER DEFENSE, WITH OR WITHOUT ROBINSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I do not know enough about football in general or the Rams in particular to say 
for absolute certain that Coach John Robinson should be fired. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that Robinson has coached more games and won more games than any 
coach in Ram history. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know how many of those games the Rams won because of him and how many 
they won in spite of him. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that Robinson had the Rams within one game of the last Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know what in the world went wrong with this season's stink-bomb Ram 
team. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that Robinson has had a longer run than most NFL coaches without 
producing a winner. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know how often a team has to win to be considered a winner, seeing as 
how the coach took a 71-50 record into this season's opening kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that Robinson is popular with an awful lot of people in a business 
that has a lot of awful people. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know if the people who employ Robinson are given a bum rap simply 
because they are not as publicly popular as Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that Robinson knows football. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know if the people who employ Robinson know football, although that 
might not be a necessity if they know how to hire the right people. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that there are people who think it would be a dirty shame for 
Robinson to be fired, people such as Matt Millen of the San Francisco 49ers, 
who said after Monday's game at Anaheim that firing the coach would be the 
Rams' "worst organizational joke ever." 
</P>
<P>
I do not know if Ram management would bring in someone new who would make us 
forget John Robinson in about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that the coach has to answer for a team that doesn't win. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know if the Rams didn't win because the players let down Robinson, 
because management let down the players or because the coach didn't know how to 
get enough out of the players. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that Kevin Greene is a wonderful defensive football player who wants 
to be paid what he is worth. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know how responsible Greene should feel for the Rams' poor start 
because of his late start. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that Jim Everett is an above-average quarterback who is hardly the 
biggest problem the Rams have. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know that Everett is so good that the Rams can continue to avoid 
drafting quarterbacks, leaving Everett feeling unchallenged for his job. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that the Rams went a little farther last season thanks to extra 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know how the Rams or their fans felt about guys who veered out of 
bounds Monday rather than fighting for the first-down marker three or four more 
yards away after pass completions on third down. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that the same coach whose record was 11-5 last season is being 
accused by some of being the stumbling block keeping the Rams from the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know how much of it was Robinson's fault that the Rams no longer have 
Eric Dickerson or Greg Bell, or that the compensation they received for 
Dickerson didn't put them over the top. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that you don't become the San Francisco 49ers overnight. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know how many more overnights these underachieving Rams need. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that John Robinson is not one of those loony, cartoony coaching 
characters along the lines of Mike Ditka, Buddy Ryan, Sam Wyche or Jerry 
Glanville. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know if the laid-back, lovey-dovey Rams might do better if some 
semi-crackpot Ditka-Ryan type came to town and put the fear of God into them. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that anybody who believes Bill Walsh is willing to go from being a 
San Francisco folk legend to the coach of San Francisco's arch-enemies is 
living in a dreamy fog and ought to take a 20-second reality timeout. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that, from a personal standpoint, I would immensely prefer to see the 
Rams win with John Robinson than without him. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know if they can or will. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know how the Rams feel about it. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know how Ram management feels about it, because Ram management is as 
mysterious as Agatha Christie and as difficult to read as Umberto Eco. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know if firing John Robinson is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know that it's not. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that it has been my well publicized but possibly idiotic opinion over 
the years that when a football team doesn't win, you ought to give some thought 
to getting rid of the players. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that the fans ought to stop thinking the Rams are the only team that 
drafts the wrong players, because the draft has been driving every NFL team 
crazy for years. 
</P>
<P>
I do know that the Dodgers have proved that free agents want to live out here, 
so what say the Rams go out and buy a few? 
</P>
<P>
And I do know that what the Los Angeles Rams need most is what the 49ers, 
Giants, Bears, Redskins and other Super Bowl powers have won championships with 
-- more guys who can play defense. 
</P>
<P>
I do not care who coaches them. Just get them.

IT'S ALL NEW TO THESE BUFFALOES; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: NOW THE COACH IS HARRINGTON. THE RECORD IS 5-3, NEARLY HALF 
THE VICTORIES COLORADO HAD LAST SEASON.

The new billboards dot the streets. Colorado Basketball: It's A New Attitude! 
</P>
<P>
Is that so? OK, new coach -- Joe Harrington of Cal State Long Beach fame. New 
uniforms -- silver and black. New attitude -- uh, they're working on it. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes are so used to losing that even when they win, they botch things 
up. This is the only team that can finish first in its own Mile High Classic, 
as the Buffaloes did earlier this month, and promptly leave the championship 
trophy sitting on the court after the awards ceremony. Maybe they thought the 
gold would rub off. 
</P>
<P>
"It shocked me," Harrington said. "They walked right off the court and just, 
well, left it there." 
</P>
<P>
And get this: When Colorado lost to Wisconsin Green Bay a few weeks ago, a fan 
sent Harrington a basket of fruit and attached a card. It read, "Don't let one 
loss get you down." 
</P>
<P>
Another fan was more realistic. He sent Harrington a bottle of Chivas Regal. A 
note wasn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
You think Harrington cares? 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I've been lucky with my coaching career," he said. "Every job I've taken 
has been a step up." 
</P>
<P>
From Hofstra to George Mason. From George Mason to Long Beach. From Long Beach 
to Colorado, the Big Eight basketball equivalent of Death Valley. This is 
progress? Harrington, 44, thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think basketball was ever emphasized here," he said. "Now they've 
made the decision to have good basketball." 
</P>
<P>
If only it were that simple. This isn't a program merely down on its luck; it's 
a program that hasn't had any of the stuff for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, all you need to know about the health of Colorado basketball can be 
found on the walls of Colorado's Events-Conference Center. There are 
championship banners for skiing, cross-country, tennis, golf, gymnastics, 
women's basketball and, oh, yes, a faded flag or two for the men's team, which 
last won a Big Eight title in the 1968-69 season, which, by the way, was the 
last time CU received an NCAA tournament invitation. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, there have been losses galore. In the last 13 seasons, Colorado has 
finished in the conference cellar nine times, including a nifty five-year 
streak that stretched from 1985 to 1989. Colorado hasn't won a regular-season 
Big Eight game in 52 consecutive attempts. That's hard to do even if you're 
trying. 
</P>
<P>
And in the last decade, Colorado has gone through a tag team of coaches, 
starting with Bill Blair, then Tom Apke and most recently, Tom Miller. Not one 
of them could finish higher than a fourth-place tie. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is Harrington's turn. He inherits a program that hasn't won more than 
three Big Eight games in a season since 1984 and hasn't had a full house at the 
11,199-seat arena since 1983. Not even an improbable second-place finish in 
last season's conference tournament could hide the obvious: The Buffaloes were 
a team divided. 
</P>
<P>
First, there were veiled charges of favoritism and racism against Miller. 
Critics also accused him, as well as Blair and Apke, of ignoring Denver's 
inner-city high schools for recruits. For better or worse, Miller ruled with an 
iron whistle. Few tears were shed when he left. 
</P>
<P>
With this as a backdrop, Harrington arrived in Boulder. The players' first 
thoughts? 
</P>
<P>
"It was like, 'Oh, Long Beach State.' And then . . . 'Oh, gawd, those ugly 
uniforms,' " said forward Rodell Guest, who is officially listed in the media 
guide as House Guest (his choice). 
</P>
<P>
Shaun Vandiver, who led the Big Eight in scoring and rebounding last season, 
said he vaguely remembers seeing Harrington and the 49ers on an ESPN telecast. 
Of course, he doesn't recall anything about the game itself, about Harrington's 
pressure defense or up-tempo style. 
</P>
<P>
"I just remember they had some ugly fluorescent uniforms on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In short, nobody knew much about Harrington, except that he wasn't the big-name 
coach everyone expected. Paul Westhead, a supposed candidate, they had heard 
of. Harrington, they hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
"But it didn't matter," Guest said. "I've been in three years of losing. I was 
going to buy into whatever he said." 
</P>
<P>
Others weren't as easily swayed. Vandiver, a junior at the time, made noises 
about declaring himself eligible for the 1990 NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few favorites of Miller, Vandiver wasn't sure he could afford to 
stay in school or adapt to a new coaching style. The father of a 2-year-old 
daughter, Vandiver's scholarship money only went so far. Once, he said, he had 
to borrow a couple of dollars to buy milk for his child. 
</P>
<P>
"If you would have asked me if I was coming out (to the NBA) at this time last 
year, I would have said yes," Vandiver said. "It was all because of financial 
difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
Vandiver met with Harrington, who gave the center two options: He could stay in 
school, improve his game and play for an offensive-minded coach, which might be 
enough to push Vandiver into the first-round of next year's draft. Or he could 
turn pro and take his chances. 
</P>
<P>
Vandiver stayed put. So far, he's averaging 21.6 points and 14.3 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Colorado is 5-3, which means the Buffaloes have won almost half as 
many games as they did all last season. The real test begins Jan. 5, when the 
Big Eight season begins. 
</P>
<P>
It's early, but Harrington's impact on the beleaguered Colorado program is 
showing up in unlikely places. At midcourt of the Events Center is a 
not-so-subtle reminder to visitors. It reads, "Elevation 5,345 feet." 
Harrington, of course, ordered the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
When his players mentioned their desire to attend a school seminar on black 
athletes, Harrington promptly altered the team's workout schedule. He consulted 
them about a dress code for road games. About curfew. About training table 
menus. About what kind of sneakers they preferred. He even kept alive college 
basketball's finest nickname -- House Guest. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, he didn't want to use the new name," Guest said. "He tried to get it 
out of the media guide. But we talked about it and I said, 'I feel I earned the 
name. The public gave me the name.' He said, 'All right, you can keep your 
name.' " 
</P>
<P>
It worked. The new and improved Guest was named most valuable player of the 
Mile High Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"If Miller was still here, I wouldn't have been MVP," Guest said. "He wouldn't 
have had the confidence in me to shoot the shots. At halftime, he would have 
told me to tone it down, that I was shooting too much. He had confidence in 
three players and I wasn't one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Also, for the first time in recent memory, there have been smile sightings at 
Colorado basketball practices. Players actually seem to be enjoying themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a change was really good for this bunch," Harrington said. Then he 
catches himself. "But I'm not trying to put any one person down from last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
He meant Miller. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, players even mimic Harrington's New England accent. In 
Harrington's dialect, Coors is pronounced Kerrs, Colorado is Cow-a-raddow and 
score is scaw. If Harrington witnesses a thunder jam, he'll say, "No doubt 
about that one." Except that it comes out, "No dat abat that one." 
</P>
<P>
The translations are courtesy of Vandiver. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington also tinkered with the 1990 schedule that initially included only 
nine home games (compared to your usual 15 or 16), no commitments for the Mile 
High Classic and nonconference games against Connecticut, North Carolina, Wake 
Forest, Wyoming and Illinois State. 
</P>
<P>
"A murderous schedule," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut was dropped. Dean Smith graciously agreed to wait until next year 
for a Tarheel-Buffalo matchup. Illinois State did the same. Harrington found 
three so-so teams -- Central Connecticut State, Eastern Michigan and American 
-- for his tournament and also boosted his home schedule to 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting, a Harrington strength, has produced four early signings, including 
one from a top 75-rated player from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll see some California kids coming here in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for attendance, Harrington enlists his players for door-to-door sales 
pitches. It isn't uncommon for the coach and, say, Vandiver, to visit a 
sorority or fraternity house and ask for their support. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't just show up and 11,199 appear," Vandiver said. "We have to sell 
ourselves. This program isn't like UNLV or Kansas, where they pack the house 
every time." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his best efforts, Harrington has had his awkward moments here. He hired 
longtime friend Tom Abatemarco, the former head coach at Drake whose two-year 
tenure at the Des Moines, Iowa, campus was marred by what amounted to a player 
revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Abatemarco also served as an assistant to former North Carolina State coach Jim 
Valvano, and it was Abatemarco who recruited the troubled Charles Shackelford 
and Chris Washburn. Shackelford is best known for his alleged involvement in a 
point-shaving scheme, and Washburn later left school early for the NBA, where 
his career was ended by a drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a lot of heat for it," Harrington said. "But I've known Tom for 20 
years." 
</P>
<P>
He defended the hiring by pointing out that Abatemarco was cleared of any 
alleged wrongdoing at Drake. As for Abatemarco's N.C. State experience, 
Harrington has said that Valvano, not the assistant coach, is the person 
responsible for dictating recruiting policy. 
</P>
<P>
Another traditional problem is the program's tenuous relationship with Denver's 
black community. When Miller was dismissed, local black leaders wanted the 
school to hire or, at the very least, seriously consider a black candidate. 
When Harrington was offered the job, those same leaders felt betrayed by the 
school administration, specifically, Athletic Director Bill Marolt. 
</P>
<P>
All of this has left Harrington in the role of peacemaker. It is slow work. 
</P>
<P>
"Other recruiters will use it against us," he said. "But the bottom line is 
that this is a people business, and there are a lot of great people at this 
school. I don't think it's such a black-white thing with the people here as it 
is with outsiders looking in. They immediately see that the number of blacks at 
Boulder and CU . . . there aren't that many. They immediately say, 'Oh, you 
don't want to go there. There aren't that many black people living there.' I 
think that's more reason to come here." 
</P>
<P>
These are the battles Harrington now fights, from racial fence-mending to 
ending prolific losing streaks. He has been asked to do what Bill McCartney did 
with Colorado's once-sorry football team: Turn a loser into a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Guess what. Harrington doesn't mind at all.

RAMS' FIERCEST FACEOFF MIGHT BE INTERNAL; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: MEETING OF MINDS BETWEEN ROBINSON AND SHAW IS LOOMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The playoff hopes are finally finished, so the countdown to what is perceived 
as a season-ending showdown between Ram Coach John Robinson and Executive Vice 
President John Shaw begins. 
</P>
<P>
And on the first day of the rest of the Rams' 1990 death march, a day after the 
San Francisco 49ers mathematically eliminated his team from contention and sent 
it to 5-9, Robinson made it clear that this is not exactly the most comfortable 
of times in Ramland. 
</P>
<P>
With all the meaning sucked out of the Rams' season, the Robinson-Shaw power 
struggle becomes by far the most compelling aspect of 1990 and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had a response to the growing speculation that he will either be 
fired or resign at the end of the season, Robinson deferred comment. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he wants to return as the Rams' coach in 1991, Robinson's words were 
vague. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll talk about it once we arrive at a decision," Robinson said, which is not 
exactly the answer of a man desperate to stay with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
When might that be forthcoming? 
</P>
<P>
"Once I make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he will sit down with Shaw at the end of the season. It is not 
expected to be a warm meeting of the minds. Robinson, albeit in jest, had quite 
a different analogy. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't have a definite time," Robinson said in response to a question about 
when the summit might take place. "It's a little bit like Saddam Hussein and 
the secretary of state. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, however, would not say who plays the Hussein role in this drama. 
</P>
<P>
He also let it be known that he doesn't particularly enjoy being asked 
questions about reports that he and Shaw are headed toward a major clash. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Rams' front office privately have said that they are growing 
weary of Robinson and his way of turning every public relations moment to his 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw has said for weeks that he would have no further comment on Robinson's 
situation until management's review of the team's performance this season was 
completed. Asked more than a month ago if he would give his coach a vote of 
confidence, Shaw refused. 
</P>
<P>
"He just said we would . . . we're going to meet at the end of the year, which 
we're going to do," Robinson said of Shaw's failure to guarantee that Robinson 
will be back. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has a year left on his contract, which reportedly pays him about 
$750,000, but he has been mentioned as a possible candidate for the vacant 
coaching job with the Cleveland Browns and possible vacancies in New England 
and Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
But more from what he didn't say Tuesday than what he did, Robinson further 
clouded this situation. Who's going to fire whom here? 
</P>
<P>
"I clearly don't want to talk about it," Robinson said. "I think the thing that 
is happening here is that there are so many non-quotes, so many, 'He told me 
that this is . . . ' 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen anybody quoted. No one's quoted. And yet people are saying that 
this is what so-and-so is saying. Some of that is very distorted and clearly 
very unfair to everybody involved. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have any quotes about this from somebody, I would respond to it. But 
none of you have, and those of you that are writing, are writing the stories 
from second- and third-hand. I just don't respond to that." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have two games left -- Sunday at Atlanta, and on the final night of 
the NFL schedule, New Year's Eve in New Orleans. This is Robinson's first 
losing season in a non-strike year. He has led the Rams to the playoffs six 
times in his eight seasons as coach. 
</P>
<P>
These are perhaps the first meaningless games in Robinson's eight Ram seasons 
other than the 48-0 walloping the 49ers handed them on the final week of the 
6-9 1987 season. But that season had the strike and the trade of Eric Dickerson 
to keep everybody's attention and point toward a renewed Ram future. 
</P>
<P>
What's left for the Rams this year, besides trying to figure out who will coach 
them in 1991? 
</P>
<P>
"Just want to win," Robinson said. "Just want to play and win. Keep our team 
going, have fun and win." 
</P>
<P>
Does he worry that the players will fall into every-man-for-himself thinking, 
destroying whatever chemistry there was on this team?

"No, I doubt it," Robinson said. "I think they'll play hard. Obviously, it's 
disappointing, but they'll play hard." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that, yes, he would like to get some more playing time for the 
younger players, and indicated that running back Marcus Dupree will play in 
each of the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
But the real countdown has nothing to do with the schedule. The real countdown 
is the wait for Robinson and Shaw to figure out if this team is big enough for 
both of them.

FINDING THE PERFECT GETAWAY;

<P>
COUPLE SAILS TO PITCAIRN ISLAND, REFUGE OF THE BOUNTY'S FLEEING MUTINEERS 
</P>

<P>
When visitors leave Pitcairn Island, the natives -- all descendants of the 
mutineers from the Bounty -- sing a song called "The Bye and Bye." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tear-jerker," says Gene Carapetyan, who went out in a longboat one day 
to see a passing freighter off. "I was sitting behind Betty Christian, Tom's 
wife, and I was crying . . . really sad, because we would be leaving the next 
day. If you can get to Pitcairn, they know you won't be coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Carapetyan and Louanne Peck found that there really is a Pitcairn Island and 
that there really was a ship called the Bounty. Pieces of the 1790 wreckage 
still show up around the tiny island. Only a mile wide and two miles long, it's 
not easy to find, and if you find it, it's difficult to land because it has no 
harbors or beaches. It is so far out of the normal shipping lanes that only 
three or four steamers stop there in a year. Tom Christian's ancestor, 
Fletcher, knew what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
For Carapetyan and Peck, it was the first of 42 ports of call on a 20,000-mile 
Pacific odyssey that took two years and four months, with prolonged stopovers 
in Hawaii, Japan and Okinawa. They did it on a Catalina 38 sloop, not an ideal 
long-distance cruising sailboat, and they did it on a budget, but the important 
thing to them is that they did it. 
</P>
<P>
And, Peck says, "I'd do it again in a minute. I didn't want to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Carapetyan met Peck at a Single Sailors Club meeting in Long Beach in 1987. 
Recently from Phoenix, he lived on his boat, "My Sweet Lord," and sold aircraft 
maintenance services. She marketed health care in Orange County. He asked her 
if she would like to go sailing. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcairn lies about 3,600 miles due south of Long Beach, from which they set 
sail on May 1, 1988. With more than 4,000 pounds of stores, the boat rode five 
inches below the waterline. Peck was the navigator. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I did a celestial navigation off the dock, I put us in 
Barstow," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she learned, and 27 days later, after using only sextants, she spotted 
Pitcairn 33 miles off the bow, dead ahead -- a feat of navigation that Capt. 
William Bligh might have acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Carapetyan had struck up an acquaintance with Christian on his ham radio before 
he left Long Beach and asked if he could bring anything. Betty Christian said 
she needed cooking oil to bake her daily bread, and Tom said -- hesitantly -- 
he was having a radio repaired here. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people say they'll bring things to Pitcairn but never get there," 
Carapetyan said. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcairn has no television but it does have VCRs, so they also took videotapes, 
including the movie "South Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out to be Betty's favorite movie," Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
From Pitcairn, they retraced the Bounty's route back to the island of Tubuai in 
French Polynesia, south of Tahiti, where the mutineers had first considered 
hiding out. After stopping at Tahiti and Moorea they proceeded to Huahine, 
where they had their most serious incident of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
A storm blew up while they were asleep at anchor and dragged the boat into 
shallow water. They awoke to a severe heel, with the the keel pounding on an 
underwater reef. They collected their passports, put on life jackets and 
prepared to abandon ship. 
</P>
<P>
"What made it even more frightening was that it was still dark outside," 
Carapetyan said. "All of the lights on the island had disappeared, probably 
because of power failure caused by the winds. We did not know where we were." 
</P>
<P>
At daybreak, a tourist, Jeff Hartborn, saw their predicament and swam out to 
help. After 11 hours of swimming around setting anchors and winching their way 
through the coral heads, they were able to work the boat into deep water again. 
</P>
<P>
The boat sustained only minor damage, and they continued north to winter in 
Hawaii. Carapetyan got a job working in the gift shop of the Ilikai Hotel. Peck 
found work with a real estate listing firm. They planned to sail to Seattle in 
the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Carapetyan said, "This Japanese gentleman walked in one day and had a sailing 
shirt on, and I had a sailing shirt on. I said, 'You must enjoy sailing," and 
he said, 'You must, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Then he said, 'There's a race from Honolulu to Hiroshima, Japan. Would you 
like to take part?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'That sounds like a good idea, but everybody says you can't go to 
Japan because there are storms, and there's no way to get back if you get 
there.' They're almost right." 
</P>
<P>
The clincher was the bottom line, where it said anybody finishing the race 
would receive 500,000 yen, or $3,475. Funds being short, they decided to go -- 
even after spending $4,800 to buy safety equipment required by the Japanese 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the first boat to enter the race," Carapetyan said. 
</P>
<P>
The race started in June of '89. Carapetyan is an experienced racer, with a 
Catalina 22 national championship and three Transpacs as a crew member. There 
was one glitch at the start when he tried to raise the headsail and the halyard 
jammed, forcing him to jury rig until he could go to the top of the mast to fix 
it. 
</P>
<P>
After struggling in light winds for 4,000 miles and 37 days, they passed the 
Ipsukushima Shrine finish line off Hiroshima on Japan's inland sea. My Sweet 
Lord placed sixth among 10 boats in its class, 15th among 21 boats overall. 
Only one-third of the fleet arrived in time for the awards banquet. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we'd missed the party," Peck said. "We didn't know the Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
They got to know them over most of the following year, which they spent in 
Japan to avoid the Pacific storm season. They found hospitality everywhere they 
went, from Tokyo to places most tourists seldom see -- such as the village of 
Kagoshima, where a nearby volcano constantly emits light ash that falls on 
everything, including visiting sailboats. 
</P>
<P>
"We estimated there were 12 foreign cruising boats in Japan the whole year we 
were there," Carapetyan said. "Very few (sailors) go there. It's sort of the 
end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
In October of '89 Carapetyan was hitching a ride with a truck driver, who 
"didn't speak a word of English, but he's very excited and pointing at the 
radio. He keeps saying, 'San Francisco.' " 
</P>
<P>
Carapetyan, who had studied limited Japanese, figured the driver wasn't raving 
about the World Series. He pulled out his dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up the word for earthquake, which is jinshin. I said, 'Jinshin,' and 
he says, 'Jinshin! Jinshin!' They have a lot of earthquakes in Japan, so it was 
very important to them. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty well informed. Our ham radio was a lifesaver. We just didn't 
always know the outcome of things." 
</P>
<P>
After a five-month stay on Okinawa off the south end of Japan, they met 
Carapetyan's daughter Page, 23, who joined them for the 4,400-mile, 38-day sail 
across the north Pacific to Seattle starting last June. Twenty-one days were 
spent in fog, and the temperature averaged 45 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
That part of the trip, Carapetyan said, was "cold, wet and miserable." 
</P>
<P>
They spent time cruising the San Juan Islands, then returned to Long Beach Aug. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
Carapetyan said he would have preferred to have a heavier, cruising-type boat, 
with a roller-furling jib that can be adjusted like a window shade for changing 
winds without switching headsails. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to take the boat we owned," Carapetyan said. "If we'd changed, we'd 
have been wiped out financially, and then we couldn't have gone." 
</P>
<P>
What did they miss? "That's easy," Peck said. "Hot and cold running water for 
showers." 
</P>
<P>
What Carapetyan didn't miss: "I have all these keys. I have a key to get on the 
dock, a key to go to the bathroom, a key to start somebody else's car. I don't 
own a car. I don't own a house, and I'm carrying nine keys. We haven't locked 
anything for 2 1/2 years, and nothing happened." 
</P>
<P>
There is a moral to their story. 
</P>
<P>
"Do it when you can. You do take a risk. I took the gamble that I was never 
going to get a job again in my field. I would take it again. Life is too short 
not to accomplish what you really want to do." 
</P>
<P>
That's what Louanne Peck said . . . or was it Fletcher Christian? 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Carapetyan and Louanne Peck will tell the story of their voyage in a 
slide presentation at the Edgewater Hotel in Long Beach Friday, Jan. 4, at 7 
p.m. Admission will be $6.

FISH REPORT: LAKE PYRAMID STRIPERS BITING INSIDE MARINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fishermen at Lake Pyramid are finding it unnecessary to explore the picturesque 
coves and coastline as striped bass continue to feed on shad and small trout 
right inside the marina. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Morgan of Canyon Country caught a 29-pound striper just beyond the boat 
dock in the Los Angeles County reservoir. Bob Hanley of Westchester, fishing 
the same area, caught three stripers averaging between 12-15 pounds.

Michael Kim and Leonard Avila are part of an evolving dream at Golden West 
College. 
</P>
<P>
The two young rookies graduated, with 29 others, from the college's latest 
Police Academy class last week. They now are on the threshold of becoming 
full-time police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something I've wanted since I was a kid growing up in South Korea," 
said Kim, 25. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I got out of the Marine Corps," added Avila, 23, "I've wanted to be 
a police officer. This project really helped me." 
</P>
<P>
Avila was referring to Project AERO, an 18-month-old program at the community 
college aimed at helping minorities qualify for, and then actually graduate 
from, the academy. 
</P>
<P>
AERO stands for Advanced Ethnic Representation and Opportunities. The project 
helps young minority students who want to be officers fulfill that dream. And 
AERO itself is somewhat of a dream come true, college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West College President Judith Valles said AERO spun off from the hopes 
and dreams of police chiefs she spoke with shortly after she took over at the 
community college two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
What she found, she said, is that most police departments are in great need of 
minority officers. The chiefs, as well as people in the minority communities, 
asked Valles for help, which is how AERO started. 
</P>
<P>
"As the ethnic fabric of our community changes, it is critical to reflect this 
multiculturalism in our police departments," Valles said. "Project AERO, which 
has received state and national recognition for its aggressive and innovative 
program, has already made a major difference in bridging cultural 
understanding." 
</P>
<P>
Art Delgado, a heavyset, cheerful, booming-voiced former Costa Mesa police 
officer, is the project's director. In explaining what the program is, he 
starts by telling what the program is not: 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a quota-hire thing. And it's not a lowering of standards of the 
Police Academy. What we do is get these candidates prepared so that they can 
qualify for the academy and then complete the courses." 
</P>
<P>
Delgado said many minority candidates for the academy have academic problems, 
including difficulties in mastering English. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell these kids: 'I want to help you realize your dream. But in order to 
help you, you've got to be prepared.' I tell them that we have this program 
that will enable them to meet the standards of all the police departments," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado said the college's Assessment Center gives participants academic tests 
that indicate whether remedial education is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"So then these kids take courses," he said, "here at the college, until they're 
ready, until they're prepared, and then they apply for Police Academy." 
</P>
<P>
He added that many of the college courses taken by the students count toward an 
associate of arts degree. 
</P>
<P>
It is not necessary to get an AA degree to graduate from the academy, but 
Delgado said he urges all students to aim for a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
"The more education you have, the more you can advance as a police officer," he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to helping minorities with academic problems, AERO helps students 
financially. "It costs a total of about $2,500 for a kid to get through Police 
Academy," Delgado said. "That includes the fees and the cost of such things as 
uniforms, batons and books. So what we do is try to get scholarships for some 
of these kids. We also get students who have already graduated to donate their 
uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
Kim and Avila, both products of the current graduating class, said in recent 
interviews that the biggest help they got from Project AERO was financial 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed financial help, and this project helped me with that," said Avila, 
who lives in Walnut Grove. "Project AERO most definitely made the difference. . 
. . It's kind of like they set my whole career up. Because without AERO, I 
never would have gone through the academy." 
</P>
<P>
Kim added that "without AERO, I never would have been able to start this 
(Police Academy) program." 
</P>
<P>
Kim received AERO financial aid and a scholarship funded by the Korean 
community in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado said various ethnic groups also help by providing scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
"The Korean community is so supportive of this program that it gives Project 
AERO a check for $2,500 for every Korean who qualifies for admission to this 
academy," he said. "The Hispanic community also is giving us good financial 
support for Hispanics who qualify for the Police Academy." 
</P>
<P>
Graduates of the 18-week academy course usually are quickly hired by police 
departments all over Southern California. Kim and Avila are on the verge of 
being hired by the police department of the Los Angeles Rapid Transit District, 
Delgado said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall career opportunities are good, he added, and police pay is better than 
ever: "Starting salary for these new police officers ranges from $28,000 to 
$32,000 a year, and that's good pay for a young man." 
</P>
<P>
College officials said Project AERO has so far placed about 40 of its academy 
graduates with California police departments. 
</P>
<P>
"The communities are the big winner in this," Delgado said. "You just can't 
imagine how much it helps a police department to have these officers working 
with people from their own ethnic community. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll give you an example," he said. "Last January, one of our Project AERO 
Korean graduates was hired by the Garden Grove Police Department. When he was 
hired, the big Korean community in that city wanted to have a banquet for this 
new officer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This kid, in his new police uniform, came into that room and started talking 
to all those people in Korean. And they went wild. They started bowing to each 
other and smiling and showing an appreciation you can't imagine. It really 
meant a lot to the people of this community to see one of their own in a police 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me," Delgado said, "it also means a lot to police work. Police get 
better cooperation from the various (ethnic) communities when the communities 
see one of their own working with the police. They have more confidence and 
more trust, because the officer can communicate in their language and in their 
culture."

ANAHEIM OKS $500,000 STUDY OF NEW DISNEY PARK'S IMPACT;

The City Council took a step toward building a second Walt Disney Co. 
attraction in Anaheim by voting Tuesday to spend about $500,000 to study how 
another theme park would affect traffic, housing, jobs and other facets of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a strong commitment, it's a very significant step forward," said City 
Manager James Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the cities of Anaheim and Long Beach have been vying to become 
the site of Disney's next theme park in Southern California. The company's 
interest in Long Beach has been viewed as more serious because Disney 
executives have already presented Long Beach officials with plans for a 
$2-billion water-themed park in the Queen Mary area. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter on Tuesday tried to downplay that perception, noting 
that building an attraction on the water in Long Beach would be more 
complicated for Disney. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in good shape here," Hunter said. "There is less red tape here (than in 
Long Beach.) They only have to deal with the City Council (in Anaheim.) In Long 
Beach, they have to deal with coastal agencies, the city redevelopment agency 
and the City Council." Disney officials were not available for comment on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted to hire Michael Brandman Associates to conduct the 
environmental study of the 1,040-acre Disneyland area, a project that is 
expected to take about a year. The city paid the same firm $30,000 in November 
to prepare a preliminary environmental study. 
</P>
<P>
As early as next month, Disney will give the consultant seven development 
options for a second theme park in Anaheim, including site plans, land-use 
plans and drawings of the proposed projects. The consultant will also study 
whether the city should permit another Disney development at all. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Brandman Associates will consider how the various options would affect 
air and water quality, noise, traffic, jobs, housing, public utilities and 
other environmental concerns. For example, each city department will be advised 
of Disney's plans and will meet with the consultant to discuss the impact of 
the project. The city may also hold up to six public hearings late next year to 
discuss the study. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to give a complete look at every aspect of every possible 
environmental impact," said Joel Fick, city planning director. 
</P>
<P>
The report will survey the area around Disneyland bounded by the Santa Ana 
Freeway, Ball Road, Walnut Street and Orangewood Avenue. Disney owns about 70% 
of the property in this area, which is under a building moratorium until 
September. The freeze was imposed in May. 
</P>
<P>
A new city fund has been established to pay for expenses related to the Disney 
expansion. Disney reimbursed the city for the $30,000 study and will contribute 
to the fund on a regular basis. The consultant will submit monthly reports to 
the city on the costs of the city, and Disney will then repay the city. 
Eventually, Disney will pay for the entire $500,000 study. 
</P>
<P>
Disney officials have released no details about their plans in Anaheim, except 
to say that a new attraction might resemble the EPCOT center at Walt Disney 
World and could be built on strawberry fields just west of Disneyland, the 
current Disneyland parking lot or property next to the Disneyland Hotel.

SUSPECT IN OHIO ROBBERY ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Ohio man suspected of armed robbery and kidnaping has been arrested after 
more than 10 months as a fugitive, federal authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Waller III, 23, of Niles, Ohio, was taken into custody without incident 
Monday at a home in Garden Grove, FBI spokesman Wylie B. Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Waller has been accused of holding up an Ohio jewelry store at gunpoint on Oct. 
27, 1989, Cox said. Waller, who police say was shot by the store's owner, was 
charged with kidnaping because he allegedly held the store's customers hostage, 
Cox said. He was arrested shortly after the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Waller failed to appear for a court hearing in February, Cox said. A few months 
later, federal authorities obtained a warrant charging him with unlawful flight 
to avoid prosecution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cox said Waller was arrested Monday after "information was developed that he 
was in Orange County." He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Waller, who had been working in Orange County as a painter and was staying at a 
rented room at 14161 Grand Meadows, is expected to be extradited to Ohio, Cox 
said.

DRUNKEN DRIVER PATROL SET FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police warn that a special force of 15 officers will patrol the city Friday 
looking for drunken drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The officers will cruise all major streets in the city, including Harbor 
Boulevard and Orangethorpe, Commonwealth and Chapman avenues, from 4 p.m. until 
3 a.m., according to Sgt. Roger White, coordinator of the special enforcement 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
White said drivers who are legally intoxicated -- with a blood-alcohol content 
of 0.08% or more -- have two options: They will either be released to the 
custody of a sober relative or friend or they will spend the night in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was chosen for the beefed-up patrol because it marks the start of the 
holiday week and would be a likely night for office parties and other events, 
White said. 
</P>
<P>
Special posters have been distributed to restaurants, bars and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole goal of this effort is to save lives. That's the bottom line," White 
said. "We want people to know where we are going to be and when, because if 
that knowledge keeps them from taking that second drink before getting in their 
car and driving off, then we will have accomplished our purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Tri-Star Towing will tow the cars of intoxicated drivers to their homes free of 
charge. In addition, the Orange-based towing service will continue providing 
24-hour-a-day free towing through the end of the month to drivers who feel that 
they have had too much to drink and can't drive home. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers can call (714) 771-7111 or (800) 323-8697 and someone will be 
dispatched to pick up the car and its driver. ERIK HAMILTON

Two men are being held on suspicion of setting fire to an abandoned auto 
dealership to cover up evidence of a burglary, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Steven M. Comstock, 18, and Doyle E. Fewell, 35, both believed to be 
transients, were arrested Saturday in connection with the fire at the former 
showroom of McLean Cadillac dealership in the 200 block of North Main Street, 
fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Fire Department spokesman Karl Ellman said the suspects started the 
fire late Friday night to "cover up evidence of another crime." He declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said Comstock and Fewell were being held on suspicion of 
burglary and arson at Orange County Jail. Their bails were $10,000 and $11,404 
respectively. Fewell was also being held on several municipal code warrants. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused an estimated $600,000 damage and took about 40 firefighters 
more than two hours to contain. 
</P>
<P>
The showroom building, which contained offices and once held half a dozen or 
more Cadillacs at a time, is owned by the city of Santa Ana and is part of a 
redevelopment district. MATT LAIT

MAN ROBS CREDIT UNION, CLAIMS EARLIER HOLDUP THERE

<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified armed man talked himself into a closed credit union office 
Tuesday, stole about $19,000 in cash and then told the frightened clerk that he 
had robbed the institution before. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who wore a full-face motorcycle helmet and carried a "sawed-off type 
of weapon," fled the scene of the 8:22 a.m. robbery after tying up the clerk, 
Newport Beach Police Lt. Tim Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a takeover type of thing," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk was the only employee in the locked Continental Federal Credit on 
Birch Street and was preparing to open when she noticed a black motorcycle pull 
up to the front of the building, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcyclist, wearing a brown jacket and camouflage army fatigues, walked 
up to the glass door, knocked and asked to be let in, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking the cyclist was a customer arriving at the credit union a few minutes 
early, she opened the door, Newman said. As soon as the door was open, the man 
pulled the gun from behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
The man then grabbed the clerk, dragged her into the back room, ordered her to 
the ground, taped her mouth and placed "novelty type of handcuffs" on her 
wrists before clearing out the safe, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
While she was on the floor, "he makes comment that he robbed the place 
previously," Newman said. "He laughs, then flees the business." 
</P>
<P>
The clerk was able to gain the attention of someone in an adjoining business, 
who alerted Newport Beach police, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and the FBI are investigating a possible link between Tuesday's robbery 
and a robbery that occurred at the same location April 16. Although both were 
armed robberies, Newman said there were differences in manner, time of robbery 
and description of the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect in Tuesday's attack was described as about 32 years old, about 
5-foot-6, medium build and wearing a red and white motorcycle helmet. The face 
plate was missing on the helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said that in the April robbery, a suspect, described as 6-foot-2 and 
weighing about 160 pounds, walked into the building at 4:20 p.m. and brandished 
a stainless-steel semiautomatic handgun, before fleeing with an undetermined 
amount of cash.

<P>
It was an all-too-familiar case of gang violence -- a payback for a payback. 
And once again, young men and boys face the prospect of long prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday at the Fullerton courthouse, four 15-year-old boys were convicted of 
first-degree murder in the death of John Leon Casillas, 16, who was killed last 
April as he walked home from a party. The four are Mauro Ramirez, Hector 
Moreida, Daniel Corona and Alfredo Romero, all alleged members of La Colonia 
gang in unincorporated areas near Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
They are scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a related case, Martin Rene Rodriguez, 22, faces murder and 
conspiracy charges in the death of Rosendo Ibarra, who was gunned down April 30 
as he talked on a pay phone. Rodriguez is allegedly a member of the Big Stanton 
gang, a rival of La Colonia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cyclical," said Orange County Sheriff's Department Capt. Bob Eason, who 
is based in Stanton. "What's happened is these people are very protective of 
each other and if someone gets hurt they take their revenge out on who did it 
and vice versa." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said this particular cycle of violence began April 1 with the 
shooting of Balthazar Medina, a member of the Big Stanton gang, by members of 
La Colonia. Big Stanton members went looking for revenge, prosecutors said. 
They found it April 30 when they gunned down Ibarra next to the pay phone. But 
the violence did not end there. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, La Colonia members ambushed Casillas, killing him as he 
walked home from a party. Although he did not belong to a gang, some of his 
relatives did, and Sheriff's Department investigators believe that Casillas was 
killed in retaliation for Ibarra's murder. 
</P>
<P>
For as far back as anyone remembers, Varrio La Colonia Independencia and Big 
Stanton have been a modern-day version of the Hatfields and McCoys, prosecutors 
said. But in the past year, the conflict has turned increasingly bloody. 
</P>
<P>
"They always had a traditional type of rivalry but it's only recently turned 
bloody," said Deputy Dist. Atty. John Anderson, who prosecuted the Casillas 
case in Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said violence threatened to disrupt the Casillas trial several times. 
He said the father of one witness said he would "cap" Anderson -- shoot him -- 
if he came back to the La Colonia neighborhood and began asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses were intimidated by a courtroom packed with gang members and 
decided at the last minute not to testify. There was also an allegation that a 
parent of one defendant tried to run off the road a woman who had been taking 
some witnesses to court. 
</P>
<P>
But Anderson said the recent prosecutions would deal a serious blow to the 
illegal activities of the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Casillas' relatives and friends who are gang members disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't L.A. County but it's almost as bad," said Casillas' uncle, a 
24-year-old Big Stanton member who would identify himself only as Popeye. "I 
don't see how it's ever going to end." 
</P>
<P>
And a 19-year-old Big Stanton member who calls himself Caspy said the violence 
has become a way of life. "It's like a merry-go-round of death," he said. "It's 
gone too far to stop it now."

HEARING: TEACHER SAYS YOUNG MEN CAME ONTO SCHOOL GROUNDS SEEKING TO ACCOST 
CHRISTIAN STEFFENS, ACCUSED IN SUBSEQUENT DANA POINT SLAYING OF ROBERT ELLIOTT.

<P>
A Dana Hills High School teacher on Tuesday testified that a "scared" Christian 
Aaron Steffens had been threatened in her class by two or three young men just 
two days before a confrontation on a Dana Point beach that ended in the fatal 
shooting of Robert James Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
Steffens of Laguna Niguel is accused of killing Elliott, 18, of Capistrano 
Beach on Sept. 8. His public defender is seeking to show that Steffens, then 
16, shot Elliott in self-defense after Steffens was bullied and terrified by 
Elliott and a group of friends. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution, however, is arguing that Steffens was the "aggressor" in the 
Dana Strand shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The case is before Juvenile Court Judge Robert B. Hutson, who will decide after 
the hearing whether Steffens should be tried as an adult or a juvenile. A 
decision to try Steffens as a juvenile would mean that he could get a lesser 
sentence if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony Tuesday, teacher Christa Jurgensen said that on Sept. 6, Steffens 
was among students in her Spanish class. 
</P>
<P>
She said that Steffens asked for permission to leave class for a brief time and 
that when he returned "he looked scared." 
</P>
<P>
Jurgensen testified that Steffens told her: "There are some guys after me. They 
want to beat me up." 
</P>
<P>
The teacher said that after class ended, "Christian stayed in the room, and he 
hid in the corner. He said, 'Shut the door. They're after me. I don't want them 
to see me or get me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jurgensen said that outside her classroom, which is in a portable building, she 
saw two or three young men, about 18 or 19 years old, who are not students at 
the high school. She said they walked to the door of her classroom and shouted 
obscenities and threats at Steffens. 
</P>
<P>
"They called into the room and said, 'Chris, we know you're in there. We're 
going to get you. . . . Just wait -- we're going to get you.' " 
</P>
<P>
The teacher added: "I was still standing in the doorway, so they did not dare 
come in." 
</P>
<P>
Jurgensen said the group then left her classroom area, and she reported the 
incident to school authorities. She did not identify the men during her 
testimony, and no one else during the court proceedings indicated who the young 
men were. 
</P>
<P>
But Marri Derby, public defender for Steffens, clearly indicated in her 
questioning that she believes that those who allegedly threatened Steffens were 
associated with Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
Derby has contended that Elliott and his friends had a history of trying to 
scare Steffens. 
</P>
<P>
The only other witness Tuesday was Caleb Cassidy, 17, of Capistrano Beach, who 
identified himself as a friend of Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy told the court that on Sept. 5, he witnessed a verbal dispute that grew 
into fistfight on the beach between Steffens and Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy testified that Steffens threw the first punch, that at the end of the 
fight Elliott chased Steffens down the beach and that Steffens escaped and ran 
to his home in Dana Point.

EL TORO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike (Squeaky) Froome didn't hesitate when asked by Coach Tim Travers to write 
what he thought his role was on El Toro High School's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"Cannon-fodder for the starters," Froome wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Froome hasn't exactly been expendable in El Toro's practices or games. In 
fact, he was a starting guard in El Toro's opening game against San Dieguito in 
the Daily Pilot Tipoff Classic. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 10 years, many El Toro reserves have opened the basketball season 
as starters while some who normally would be first string continued through the 
Southern Section playoffs -- in football. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Travers scrambles things for a week or two while the football 
team marches through the postseason. This year, missing seven players (four 
starters), he combined his varsity and junior varsity teams for two weeks 
before the opener, then filled the gaps in the starting lineup with two varsity 
reserves and two junior varsity players. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows their roles on the team in the summer," Travers said. "Once 
you've earned a starting spot, that position is yours no matter when you're 
ready to play. But we've been filling the gaps for the past 10 years because 
our football program has been so successful. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Froome, a lounge-act player who was suddenly the main room's spotlight 
when El Toro opened against San Dieguito. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous, but it was exciting," said Froome, who scored three points. "I 
finally got a chance to show what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
Froome fails to mention that El Toro was beaten, 84-56, or that the football 
players returned for the next game. But then, he knows his role. 
</P>
<P>
"The harder I work in practice, the better the starters will be on game night," 
he said. "Practice is fun. That's where I get to play the most. I never 
complain about practice." 
</P>
<P>
Travers went to his bench for a second time last weekend when El Toro played in 
the semifinals and third-place game of the Beverly Hills tournament. Starting 
forward Rob Johnson and center Jeremy Hogue missed both because of a recruiting 
trip to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
But Travers, who has won an average of 15 games per season, isn't one to 
complain. 
</P>
<P>
"Once in a while, I'll hear a basketball coach complaining about starting the 
season without some of his starters who play football, and I get a good laugh," 
he said. "I'm consistently in that situation. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'd never complain. The football team's success breeds success into our 
basketball season. We got beat by San Dieguito, but I was real happy with the 
way we played. The players did what they had been taught. They just got beat by 
better athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Each year, El Toro's booster club recognizes a player who displays the best 
attitude, effort, sportsmanship and conduct. The player accepting the award at 
the team banquet has never been a starter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's usually given to a player you've never heard of," Travers said. "It's 
always a guy who accepts his role. These days, it's rare to find a kid who 
accepts his role as a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to see guys who enjoy the camaraderie of the players and want to be 
part of a team. Generally, we've always had guys who understand the importance 
of being a role player." 
</P>
<P>
Darren Teasck, a 20-year-old volunteer assistant freshman coach at El Toro, was 
a bench-warmer who didn't get his chance to score until the final game of the 
1986-87 season. And even then, Teasck needed an assist from Bret Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Teasck was the only varsity player who had failed to score going into the 
finale against San Clemente. Teasck entered the game in the fourth quarter with 
El Toro comfortably ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Teasck was still scoreless in the final seconds when Johnson shouted to one of 
San Clemente's players, "Foul him" as Teasck brought the ball up the court. The 
defender, a friend of Johnson's from football, obliged. 
</P>
<P>
Teasck made two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, he said he has no regrets about the time he spent on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I played because I loved the game and wanted to be part of a team," Teasck 
said. "I was just glad to be part of the team. Now, as a coach, I think I 
relate to the subs. I know they want to play, and sometimes it's tough working 
your butt off all week and then sitting. 
</P>
<P>
"But later on, they'll realize there's something special about being part of 
the team."

WALSH GOES FROM TOWELS TO TOP SCORER

<TEXT>
<P>
Derrick Walsh, leading scorer on the Dana Hills High School boys' basketball 
team, has known tough times. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh was cut from the freshman team. He was academically ineligible to compete 
as a sophomore and he was the team's manager as a junior, picking up towels and 
sweats and passing out water bottles. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, he never gave up. He spent weekends on the courts at Main Beach 
in Laguna Beach or the Laguna Niguel YMCA, playing the game he loves. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent a lot of time practicing and hoping," Walsh said. "I knew I could 
play, I just needed a chance." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Walsh has finally gotten his chance. He's averaging 18 points and 
has reached double figures in all six of Dana Hills' games. He was named to the 
all-tournament team at the Santa Maria tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"All the credit should go to him," said Tom Riach, Dana Hills assistant. 
"Derrick has shown a lot of perseverance. He had the courage to never give up." 
</P>
<P>
So how did someone who was cut as a freshman develop into the team's leading 
scorer? 
</P>
<P>
For openers, Walsh competed each weekend against some of the area's top college 
and high players at Main Beach. The four-on-four half-court games leave a lot 
to be desired in the area of fundamentals, but few who aren't street-tough 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
"They cheat, but it's good competition," Walsh said. "Nobody likes to lose down 
there. They'll do just about anything to win. Playing there every weekend made 
me a stronger player." 
</P>
<P>
Then there were the recreation league games on Tuesday and Thursday nights at 
the Laguna Niguel YMCA, where Walsh perfected his three-point shot and drives 
to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good competition, but you also pick up some bad habits," he said. 
"There's a lot of hot-dogging that goes on and not a lot of emphasis on 
fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
There also were the countless hours Walsh spent shooting at Marina Hills Park 
near the apartment where he lives with his mother, Carmen. 
</P>
<P>
"I played little games against myself . . . three-point shooting contests, 
free-throw contests and tip drills," he said. "During the summer, I'd leave 
home at 9 to go play and get home around 5. I'd play all day." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Walsh learned to become a team player attending summer camps conducted 
by Laker stars Byron Scott and Magic Johnson. Walsh spent a week at Johnson's 
camp at Cal Lutheran in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
But the humbling of Derrick Walsh came last season when he served as team 
manager while sitting out a second season because of academic ineligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be a part of the team, so I decided to become the student 
manager," he said. "I was just happy to be around the team. My friends used to 
make fun of me folding the towels, but I wanted to be part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh attended every practice and worked on his jump shot when he wasn't icing 
down a player's sore knee or elbow. All along, Walsh's teammates encouraged him 
to keep trying. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought being ineligible was unfair, but I never gave up," he said. "I 
played every day. I love the competition, whether you're playing one-on-one or 
four-on-four." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he received As, Bs and one C on his last report card and hopes to 
play college basketball next year. 
</P>
<P>
"But even if I don't go on to play basketball in college," he said, "I'll still 
find a game to play somewhere."

GOOD BENCH-WARMERS DO MORE THAN SIT ON THEIR HANDS; 
</P>
<P>
BOYS' BASKETBALL: THEY CHEER, NEEDLE, ENCOURAGE AND HOPE TO PLAY IN GAMES. IN 
PRACTICE, THEY MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR TEAMS TO SCRIMMAGE AND RUN DRILLS.

<P>
If you rode the pines for Los Alamitos High School in the late 1970s, you 
followed a certain code. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Allen organized the Bench Buddies in 1978-79. I set up a charter branch 
on the junior varsity that season, then kept up the tradition on the varsity 
the next year. 
</P>
<P>
The rules were simple. Mostly we cheered for Los Alamitos. But if the other 
team was pulling away, we rooted -- quietly -- for them and some playing time. 
</P>
<P>
When we were going good, we kept the same seats on the bench. In 1979-80, Los 
Alamitos was 15-8. I spent a lot of time sitting between Mike Stamper, a 
ball-hawking defensive back on the football team, and Joe Wokal, a 
sharp-shooter whose sluggish defense kept him out of the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
One goal was to avoid breaking a sweat so you could skip the shower and go 
straight out afterward. You never, ever wanted to sit next to the guys who'd 
been in the game, lest they sweat on you. 
</P>
<P>
If your name was actually called by Craig Conrad, the coach, you simply stood, 
removed your warm-ups and walked cooly to the scorer's table as if this 
happened all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Once in, you went for broke. Who knew when you'd play again? It could be weeks. 
It could be never again. I played in only seven of 23 games in 1979-80, scoring 
a grand total of three points. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, our ultimate goal was to make the first-string run lines. If we 
shredded their two-three zone press, held their passing game offense scoreless 
or drained a jumper in Mike Moore's face, it could happen. 
</P>
<P>
If you showed up the starters bad enough and made Conrad furious over their 
play, they'd run for sure. We watched, encouraging but prideful at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
You took your victories where you could. 
</P>
<P>
First, some ground rules. This is not about a basketball team's sixth, seventh, 
eighth or even ninth players. It's about the last three, four or five. The guys 
who never play unless it's blow-out city. 
</P>
<P>
A team's sixth through ninth players are called substitutes. A team that plays 
nine guys has great depth. Nobody plays more than 10, particularly in a close 
game. On most high school teams, the drop-off in talent is too steep. 
</P>
<P>
A team's 10th through 15th players are called Scrubs. Or Pine Brothers. Or 
Splinter Brothers. There's a ton of names for the guys who don't play. None is 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing is, most teams couldn't win without them. 
</P>
<P>
"What's that old cliche about only being as strong as your weakest link?" Mater 
Dei Coach Gary McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Mater Dei's Scrubs, as McKnight calls them, are probably better than 
most. You don't win seven Southern Section championships in eight seasons with 
only five good players. The Monarchs' junior varsity is often strong enough to 
beat some varsity teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Scrubs do more than sit, though it's often hard for the untrained eye to 
know this. From their spots on the bench, they cheer, needle, encourage and, 
above all, hope against hope they will play. 
</P>
<P>
They fulfill a more valuable role in practice, running an opposing team's 
offense and defense. They make it possible for teams to scrimmage, to run 
drills. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, they were pretty fair players on a school's freshman, sophomore 
and junior varsity teams. But they aren't skilled enough to join the regular 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
"You gotta love the kids with the work ethic and the unselfishness," Irvine 
Coach Steve Keith said. "You've got to reward the kids with the great 
attitudes, who are fun to coach. You better surround yourself with good kids 
all the way down the bench or you're not going to win." 
</P>
<P>
McKnight and Keith said a good bench-warmer is hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
Often, they'll cut a more talented player who can't accept sitting on the bench 
in favor of keeping a less-talented one who's thrilled just to be on the 
varsity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to sit on the bench," McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
And he'd know, having been a Scrub in his playing days at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're not happy sitting there," he said, "you have to at least fake it to 
me. I can't look down there and worry if you're pouting. You have to be up, 
cheering and getting everyone else involved." 
</P>
<P>
McKnight goes as far as appointing a captain of the Scrubs, to "set the tone" 
on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
At Irvine, Keith meets with the seniors who he figures aren't going to play to 
discuss their roles. He tries to paint a bleak picture. 
</P>
<P>
"I want them to look me in the eye and say, 'I don't want to invest that much 
time into sitting on the bench,' " Keith said. "It takes a special kid to 
accept that role. Twenty years ago, hey, making the team and getting a varsity 
letter, that was enough for most kids. That's not the case now. 
</P>
<P>
"Most coaches I know are real selective about the type of player who's going to 
be in that position." 
</P>
<P>
So what kind of person submits to this thankless toil? 
</P>
<P>
Meet John Han, a 5-foot-8 senior guard at Marina. 
</P>
<P>
Every team has a John Han. He's probably a little too small and a little too 
slow to break into the starting lineup. But he has a good-looking jump shot 
and, best of all, a real love for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Every crowd pulls for a guy like Han. When he does play, the fans cheer every 
time he touches the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Han's career is typical of many Scrubs. 
</P>
<P>
He played on the freshman team at Ocean View, sat out his sophomore season, 
then transferred to Marina as a junior. Last season, he started on the junior 
varsity, averaged 10 points and was the team's top defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he has played in two of Marina's six games, never for more than a 
few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I get into it," he said. "It's my role. I practice hard and cheer the 
starters. At first, everybody says, "How's life on the bench?' I ignore them. I 
think I'm a big part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
He comes to practice every day, rubbing elbows with greatness. And that's 
exciting, too. 
</P>
<P>
Han's teammate is Cherokee Parks, a 6-11 center who's headed for Duke next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great," Han said. "He's like the No. 1 player in the nation. And he's a 
nice guy. Someday he'll go to the pros. That'll be great. I can say I played 
with Cherokee Parks. He was on my team. Plus, I got my varsity letter." 
</P>
<P>
Some starters on Mater Dei's 1985-86 team will never forget Mike O'Connor, who 
tops McKnight's all-time Scrub list. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor was an outstanding football player but something of a misfit on a 
basketball team that included LeRon Ellis (now at Syracuse), Tom Peabody 
(Loyola Marymount) and Stu Thomas (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo). 
</P>
<P>
Still, McKnight liked his aggressive style. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor missed 15 consecutive games, mainly because of an injury, but he might 
not have played anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei was playing Crenshaw in the Southern California Regional final at the 
Sports Arena and was trailing early. McKnight, looking for a spark, walked to 
where O'Connor was sitting at the end of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers the conversation this way: 
</P>
<P>
McKnight: "Well, Mike can you do it?" 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: "Yeah, I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
So he sent in O'Connor, who hadn't played in a game in more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing I know, (Crenshaw guard) Stevie Thompson is flying outta bounds 
(thanks to a body-block by O'Connor), people are diving on the floor after 
loose balls and we're back in the game," McKnight said. "He was the type of kid 
who could come in, and his spark and drive ignited the team." 
</P>
<P>
After two overtimes, Mater Dei lost. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor's game that night was the stuff bench-warmers' dreams are made of.

BANKERS OPPOSE LEVY TO BUILD UP INSURANCE FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Banking industry authorities Tuesday criticized a proposal for a one-time 
assessment of as much as $25 billion to shore up the sagging deposit insurance 
fund, arguing that many banks can't afford it, that it will worsen a national 
credit crunch and that bank customers may pick up a disproportionate share of 
tab through higher fees. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers interviewed agreed that there is a clear need to bolster the fund, 
protect taxpayers and halt the slip in public confidence plaguing banks. But 
they reacted unfavorably to a proposal outlined Monday by Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman that banks be assessed a special 
fee equal to $1 for every $100 in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
"A 1% assessment on deposits is an enormous amount of money. I don't see any 
way you could do it in a one-time shot," said former Comptroller of the 
Currency C. Todd Conover, who now is a banking consultant with the KPMG Peat 
Marwick accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
The $25 billion is so large that it will far exceed what the nation's banks are 
expected to earn this year. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has said the 
banking industry is healthy enough to bail itself out, as has Seidman. That 
point was challenged by Brookings Institution economist Robert Litan, who said 
it would result in additional bank failures costing the bank insurance fund $8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
But some banking authorities questioned whether the industry can provide such a 
large infusion at a time when profits are sliding and when capital -- the 
financial cushion banks maintain to protect against losses -- is so hard to 
come by. Investors are already shunning banks, and Seidman's proposal, analysts 
said, would undoubtedly make them even more wary. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the critical question is whether the banking system can withstand that 
kind of depletion at a time when they are trying to build capital and are under 
regulatory pressures," said Joe Belew, president of the Consumer Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said regulators are discussing with banks details about the huge 
financial contributions, which are needed to protect the fund that insures bank 
deposits up to $100,000. Regulators and lawmakers are eager to spare taxpayers 
from any bailout like the one they are already paying for in the nation's 
savings and loan debacle. 
</P>
<P>
In return for the assessment, Seidman said, banks should be granted expanded 
powers, including the right to diversify into other businesses and to open 
branches across state lines without setting up separate banks. In addition, 
banks should be allowed to count the money they pay to the fund as capital 
regulations require them to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry executives criticized the linking of the assessment with expanded 
powers, saying the Administration is effectively putting a price tag on new 
powers that should be granted to banks regardless. They also criticized the 
proposal that the money paid to the fund be counted as capital, calling it an 
accounting gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
Independent banks were among the most critical of the proposal, saying the 
"carrot" offered banks as an incentive to pay the assessment is designed almost 
exclusively for large banks that are in a position to take advantage of the 
expanded powers. 
</P>
<P>
"There is almost nothing in this for smaller banks except reduced 
profitability," said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the 
Independent Bankers Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
Banking officials also said the proposal will probably meet heavy resistance in 
areas such as the Northeast, where banks can least afford to pay the fee. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt it will be a factor. New England banks are under a tremendous amount 
of strain in comparison to California banks," said Stan Cardenas, senior deputy 
superintendent for the California Banking Department. 
</P>
<P>
A number of bankers said they were reserving judgment, noting that the proposal 
is one of several possibilities being discussed. Executives said they favor 
bolstering the fund over time instead of a one-time assessment. 
</P>
<P>
The American Bankers Assn., the industry's main trade group, had little 
specific to say about the proposal because officials there are still studying 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be a burden, no question about it. It's a burden we are going 
to have to shoulder to make sure the fund gets on a solid footing," spokesman 
Mark Burneko said. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers also said the proposal would drain too much from the banking system and 
appears to conflict with efforts by others in the Administration to ease the 
nation's credit crunch. One banker noted, for example, that an assessment of 
$20 billion to $25 billion effectively takes some $400 billion to $500 billion 
out of the system that would be available for lending. That assumes that for 
every $1 in capital that a bank maintains it loans $20. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, regulators recommended Tuesday that troubled banks pay a higher 
rate for deposit insurance than healthy ones. Banks now pay a flat rate.

An administrative law judge ruled Tuesday that President Bush's son, Neil, 
violated conflict-of-interest regulations in the failure of a Denver thrift and 
recommended that he be restricted in any future roles with financial 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The judge agreed with federal regulators that Neil Bush failed to properly 
disclose his business relationships with two of the largest borrowers at 
Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn., where he was a director for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Bush "engaged in unsafe and unsound practices involving multiple conflicts of 
interests," said the judge, who works for the Office of Thrift Supervision, 
which regulates thrifts and brought the civil charges against Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Bush contested the allegations at a hearing in Denver last September, and his 
attorney said Tuesday that the judge's decision would be appealed to the 
director of OTS. If the ruling is upheld, the attorney said he will take the 
matter to federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it sounds any more logical or rational than when OTS argued it," 
said James E. Nesland, Bush's attorney. "When we go to a real court with real 
judges, I expect to have a contradictory decision and have it decided on the 
merits." 
</P>
<P>
OTS could have sought a ban that would have barred Bush from being involved 
with a bank or savings institution ever again. But the agency had requested 
only a so-called cease-and-desist order to restrict Bush's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel J. Davidson, the administrative law judge, recommended that Bush be 
required to obtain a lawyer's advice on potential conflicts if he takes another 
position at a financial institution. The judge also said Bush should make a 
full disclosure of his business deals annually and abstain from voting on 
issues where he has an interest if he joins another institution. 
</P>
<P>
The White House press office said President Bush would have no comment on the 
judge's findings. When the allegations first surfaced, the President said he 
had full faith in his son, but he vowed to stay out of the legal process. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush, a Denver oilman, was a director of Silverado from 1985 to 1988. He 
resigned when his father was nominated to the Republican presidential ticket. 
Later that year, regulators seized Silverado and declared it insolvent. Its 
failure is expected to cost the taxpayers $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the allegations against Bush were his relationships with two 
Colorado developers, Bill L. Walters and Kenneth M. Good. The two developers 
ultimately defaulted on more than $100 million in loans from Silverado, which 
helped bring about its collapse, according to regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators charged that Neil Bush failed to disclose adequately to his 
fellow directors that he had extensive business dealings with the developers at 
a time that they were receiving loans from Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
According to the charges, Neil Bush violated his duties by voting to approve 
loans to Walters without disclosing the extent of his business deals with 
Walters and he personally arranged for Walters to receive a $900,000 line of 
credit from Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators also accused Bush of failing to tell his fellow directors that 
Good was preparing to invest $3 million in Bush's oil drilling firm at a time 
Good told Silverado he was broke and could not make his loan payments. Good 
also loaned Bush $100,000 that was never repaid. 
</P>
<P>
In his ruling, Davidson accepted the agency's allegations concerning the 
conflict-of-interest violations and said they constituted unsafe practices. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Banking Committee, said 
in an interview that the administrative judge's decision seemed appropriate to 
the actions of Bush, who testified at hearings conducted earlier this year by 
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, my own opinion is that he was a little minnow swimming with a bunch 
of barracudas," said Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his fellow directors and some former Silverado executives also face a 
$200-million lawsuit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which accuses them 
of gross negligence.

EVEN IN DOWNTURN, REMODELING CONTRACTORS STILL NAIL DOWN JOBS 
</P>

Blair O'Callaghan doesn't have his name on residential developments all over 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
But the 35-year-old contractor may well be the envy these days of builders with 
bigger names and broader reaches. 
</P>
<P>
O'Callaghan is working. Every day. 
</P>
<P>
He is a remodeling contractor, and when times get tough in the building trades, 
remodelers typically do better than their brethren. 
</P>
<P>
"Remodeling has always been kind of counter-cyclical," said Ben Bartolotto, 
research director for the Construction Industry Research Board in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"It does well in good times and does a lot better than new-home building in bad 
times." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in the 1981-82 recession, when the value of new-home and apartment 
construction in the state plummeted 24% the first year and fell a 23% the next 
year, remodeling permits sagged only slightly -- off 6% in 1981 and down 3.5% 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
As the Southland economy weakens, the research board is forecasting 
back-to-back record years for remodeling contracts in the state this year and 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say that everything is as easy as it was in the boom years. 
</P>
<P>
O'Callaghan had five employees a year ago and says he "rarely took a job for 
less than $25,000." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of his work was done in Newport Beach, where $200,000 remodeling jobs 
were not uncommon and he often would have to hire scores of subcontractors to 
do the jobs his own crew couldn't handle. 
</P>
<P>
Business was so good then that O'Callaghan, who doesn't advertise -- not even a 
Yellow Pages listing -- had a six-month backlog of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Today, O'Callaghan Construction is Blair O'Callaghan and one helper. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that is by design: He said he took half the year off to remodel his own 
home and to get married. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm paying for that time off," he said. "When I decided to cut back, I 
wasn't planning for a recession. I lost contact with the market." 
</P>
<P>
But even without the comfort of a big backlog, and in the midst of a mild 
recession, O'Callaghan bubbles with optimism. 
</P>
<P>
He is working two jobs -- building a three-car garage and workshop for a 
neighbor in north Santa Ana and reconfiguring a Costa Mesa residence to turn a 
labyrinth of small rooms on one side of the house into an airy kitchen and two 
new bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
In his business reputation is the best marketing tool, and O'Callaghan says he 
is "very comfortable" with his. 
</P>
<P>
Money is tighter and jobs sometimes are smaller, but O'Callaghan says he has "a 
lot of confidence in my ability to keep myself busy. . . . People always want 
to add on or fix up, and the desire gets stronger when they can't move into a 
newer, bigger house." 
</P>
<P>
O'Callaghan is in the right place. 
</P>
<P>
Although the once-blistering pace of homes sales in the Southland has slowed to 
a mere crawl, people are spending record amounts of money improving existing 
homes, according to building permit records. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months of this year, homeowners in Southern California 
counties spent nearly $1.6 billion on remodeling, up 4% from $1.53 billion for 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1989, Californians spent $3.14 billion on remodeling projects for 
which they obtained building permits, with 57%, or $1.8 billion, of that amount 
spent in the six Southland counties. Los Angeles County led the pack with $1.16 
billion, or 35%, of the state total. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1990, the U.S. Census Bureau reported recently, the Los 
Angeles-Long Beach market posted total remodeling permit value of $538.4 
million. That was more than twice the $215-million value for the second-place 
market, which includes Washington and suburban Maryland and Virginia. San Diego 
County was in 11th place nationally, with $110.1 million in remodeling permits, 
followed closely by Orange County, with $110 million, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
None of that comes as a surprise to O'Callaghan, who started his contracting 
business in 1980 -- after a five-year apprenticeship as a carpenter and just in 
time for the start of a major recession. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just getting going when the last recession hit" in 1981-82, he said. 
"But I was really busy all through it. People were remodeling then because 
interest rates were so high they couldn't afford a new house. So they decided 
to cash in some equity and fix up what they had while they waited for the 
market to improve. 
</P>
<P>
"This time, though, people have money, and interest rates aren't all that high. 
It's just that people are real tentative about the economy. But the effect is 
about the same. They aren't buying new houses, so they are fixing up their old 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
The challenges, as O'Callaghan sees them, are twofold: People are becoming a 
lot more cost-conscious as the economy worsens, which means jobs are getting 
smaller and profit margins thinner; and a lot of construction trades workers 
who have lost jobs with new-home builders are competing with established 
remodeling contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, he said, homeowners want to do some or all of the finishing work 
themselves. "Contractors like myself, guys who have been around for 10 or 15 
years, are losing out to the neighbor who was a carpenter. So if you want the 
job, you have to lower your prices." 
</P>
<P>
On the up side, he said, "there are a lot of subcontractors looking for work 
who used to be booked solid for months and months. So they are lowering their 
prices, too. And that makes it easier to bid competitively." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Recession For Remodelers 
</P>
<P>
Although new construction is expected to drop by as much as 30% in 1990, 
remodeling will contiunue its growth of the past four years.

spent in the six Southland counties. Los Angeles County led the pack with $1.16 
billion, or 35%, of the state total. 
</P>
<P>
And those totals reflect only jobs for which permits were issued -- a small 
part of all remodeling work, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people just don't bother to get a permit on the smaller jobs" that make 
up most of the market, said Dickson Clements, spokesman for the Remodelors 
Council trade group in Washington. His group estimates that permits reflect 
just 13% of the value of work done nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the remodelers trade group is projecting a record $105 billion in 
remodeling permits for 1990, up 4.1% from last year. "The pace for remodeling 
is very strong, while new-home building is falling off," Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the nation, as it leads the state, is the Southern California area. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of 1990, the Census Bureau reported recently, the Los 
Angeles-Long Beach market posted a total remodeling permit value of $538.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>

which includes Washington and suburban Maryland and Virginia. San Diego County 
was in 11th place nationally, with $110.1 million in remodeling permits, 
followed closely by Orange County, with $110 million, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the value of permits issued for remodeling projects this year is 
expected to increase 5.4% to a record $3.31 billion, according to the 
Construction Industry Research Board. That compares to an anticipated 30.4% 
decline in the value of new-home and apartment construction, to $18.2 billion 
from last year's record $26.1 billion, the research group said. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1991, remodeling permit values are expected to jump 6% more, to $3.5 
billion, while the value of new residential permits falls 6%, to $17.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
None of that comes as a surprise to O'Callaghan, who started his contracting 
business in 1980 -- after a five-year apprenticeship as a carpenter and just in

Suits Over Drug for Schizophrenics: Attorneys general from 23 states, including 
California, accused a pharmaceutical firm of price fixing and other trade 
violations in marketing a new drug for schizophrenics. In lawsuits filed in 
U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the states claim the drug, Clozaril, is 
available only if a patient also buys an expensive blood-monitoring package. 
The attorneys general sued Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. of East Hanover, N.J., 
and Caremark Inc., of Lincolnshire, Ill., which has an exclusive pact with 
Sandoz to provide the blood-monitoring package.

AT&amp;T to Lower Some Rates: The telecommunications giant said it would cut 
interstate and international long-distance rates for consumers and 
small-business consumers by $33 million a year, effective Jan. 1. The cuts, 
which reflect lower fees that AT&amp;T will pay in 1991 to local phone firms 
for access to customer lines, include: a 1.1% drop for basic long-distance 
service from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays, and a reduction in charges on calls 
from the U.S. mainland to the area formerly known as East Germany.

House of Fabrics Makes Bid: The Los Angeles-based retailer of fabrics, notions, 
crafts and sewing machines said it offered $13.50 in cash or common stock to 
buy Fabricland of Portland, Ore. House of Fabrics said the offer is contingent 
on working out a definitive agreement and the approval of both firms' boards 
and shareholders, and that of regulatory authorities. House of Fabrics operates 
629 stores in 43 states; Fabricland has 80 stores in six Western states selling 
similar merchandise.

LOOKING AHEAD: REASON TO RUSH INTO CLEANER FUELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Much of the burden of the Clean Air Act recently enacted by Congress will fall 
on oil refiners, who must embark on a major and costly reformulation of 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, oil companies have hoped to avoid this burden, or at least to soften 
the blow. Now that legislation is in place, it's becoming clear what must be 
done to meet the letter of the law -- and, more important, what opportunities 
exist in a changing business environment. 
</P>
<P>
The drive for cleaner fuels will mean that oil refiners can profit if they 
reformulate before their competitors do. It is also likely to bring new 
opportunities to natural gas and electric utility companies, not to mention 
entrepreneurs and investors. 
</P>
<P>
The reformulation ahead represents the most significant change in fuels since 
unleaded gasoline. To produce cleaner gasoline, new hardware must be installed 
in refineries to reduce levels of objectionable compounds and toxins and to add 
oxygenates for leaner combustion and lower carbon monoxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
It will be costly. By the year 2000, domestic refiners will need to invest from 
$10 billion to $22 billion. This investment will raise gas pump prices by about 
a nickel a gallon. But the prospects are not nearly as dire as some industry 
lobbyists have predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that respond quickly to the changes ahead can gain a competitive 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
The Clean Air Act mandates that gasoline sold in nine metropolitan areas -- 
including Los Angeles, San Diego, New York and Chicago -- undergo reformulation 
in phases, beginning in 1995. The shift in marketing patterns will be 
far-reaching. 
</P>
<P>
Although on paper the law affects only certain regions, in practice it is 
likely that gasoline sold in most areas of the United States will be 
reformulated by the decade's end. 
</P>
<P>
Logistics is one reason. 
</P>
<P>
Terminals supplying reformulated gasoline to a legislated region typically also 
supply bordering areas. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, many city and state governments are likely to extend the federal 
standards to their areas. 
</P>
<P>
Competition, too, will drive change. Companies are already realizing that 
reformulated gasoline offers excellent product differentiation in an age of 
environmental awareness. 
</P>
<P>
In California, Atlantic Richfield is adding to market share by promoting and 
selling a form of cleaner gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
Marathon, Phillips and Conoco market their gasoline in the Midwest, largely in 
cities not covered by the law. 
</P>
<P>
Yet these companies are already positioning themselves by selling reformulated 
gasoline in cities such as Denver, St. Louis and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers in these cities, not lawmakers, are the force behind this marketing 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Among domestic refiners, the likely winners will be those who quickly 
reformulate, differentiate their products and stake out their markets. 
</P>
<P>
They can reap profits in the next few years. Some companies may back out of 
regions where they are not strong. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the competition and marketing changes brought by reformulation will 
contribute to the current trend of industry consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
Because foreign suppliers are unlikely to meet U.S. reformulation standards, at 
least for a few years, the resulting drop in gasoline imports should favor 
domestic refiners. 
</P>
<P>
Reformulation may also benefit U.S. auto makers, who are hopeful that the more 
uniform compositions of gasoline will make it somewhat easier for them to 
design vehicle improvements to further reduce tailpipe emissions. 
</P>
<P>
In the next 10 to 15 years, the role of alternative fuels will likely be 
limited to a small share of fleet vehicles, such as urban buses, delivery 
trucks and government and company vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Methanol is often mentioned as an alternative fuel, but it appears more likely 
that compressed natural gas (CNG) will be the choice for safety, operational 
and cost reasons. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of suppliers could market CNG, most notably local gas companies. 
Entrepreneurs could also play a role in marketing CNG. 
</P>
<P>
Amoco has announced that it will introduce CNG refueling stations at some 
locations to take advantage of its vast natural gas reserves. 
</P>
<P>
In the long term, electric fleet vehicles appear to be an attractive answer to 
emissions problems in polluted areas. Milk trucks in London now run on 
electricity. However, such vehicles need to improve operating range and 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
If cost-efficient electric vehicles are introduced, the winners would be 
electric utility companies. 
</P>
<P>
Although new fuel requirements may be difficult and costly, those who 
successfully take up the challenges of reformulation and cleaner energy will be 
rewarded.

FED PROVIDES THE MOTIVATION; DOW SOARS 33.41

<P>
News that the Federal Reserve had cut the key discount rate to 6.5%, effective 
today, sent Wall Street stocks higher Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The market thought about it for about three seconds, then it went up, up and 
away," said Alfred Goldman, director of technical research at A. G. Edwards 
&amp; Sons. 
</P>
<P>
After the Fed's afternoon announcement, the 30-share Dow Jones industrial index 
gained more than 27 points in minutes. The index closed up 33.41, or 1.3%, at 
2,626.73. It had been up as much as 39 points, however. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a robust 176.5 million shares, 
compared to 118.6 million Monday. Gaining issues outnumbered losers 971 to 581. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's rate cut had been long-anticipated by financial markets, which have 
sought relief for the sagging economy and weak banking sector. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed said it will cut the discount rate -- the rate on short-term loans to 
member banks -- to 6.5% from 7%. It was the first time the Fed has changed the 
rate since Feb. 24, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates are considered a key tool in helping turn the faltering 
economy, by making credit easier and taking pressure off heavily indebted 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed has been cautious about cutting interest rates for fear of putting too 
much money into the financial system, thereby stoking inflation. But Tuesday 
the Commerce Department reported that consumer prices rose a moderate 0.3% in 
November, leaving room for the central bank to act. 
</P>
<P>
The big question now is whether the Fed's actions are too late. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say the economy's slide into a steep recession now will have to 
run its course, even if the Fed pushes rates even lower. Indeed, the market's 
relative caution suggested that many investors see the rate cut as too little. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Industrial and technology stocks led the market, on the expectation that a 
revived economy would help those firms' fortunes first. The Dow was pulled 
higher by GM, up 1 1/4 to 35 1/8; GE, up 1 1/2 to 56 7/8, and 3M Co., up 1 3/8 
to 85 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Among tech stocks, AST Research soared 5 1/2 to 32 after it said second-quarter 
profits would be sharply higher. (Related stories, D3.) AST also set a 2-for-1 
stock split. Elsewhere, Intel rose 1 1/2 to 37 1/4, Apple jumped 2 1/8 to 42 
1/4, Conner Peripherals rose 1 5/8 to 24 1/4 and Computer Sciences added 1 1/8 
to 48. 
</P>
<P>
* Citicorp slashed its dividend and said it would post a loss in the fourth 
quarter, but the stock gained 3/4 to 14 1/8 as investors expected worse. Other 
bank stocks rallied on news of the Fed rate cut. Manufacturers Hanover jumped 1 
7/8 to 20 7/8, Security Pacific rose 1 3/8 to 22 and BankAmerica added 1 1/2 to 
25. Bankers Trust rose 2 7/8 to 44 1/8 after raising its quarterly dividend to 
63.5 cents a share from 58.25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
* Retailers were strong on hopes for the economy. TJX jumped 1 to 10 5/8, Gap 
gained 1 3/8 to 33 1/2 and May Department Stores leaped 1 7/8 to 44 3/8. But 
Sherman Oaks-based House of Fabrics lost 1/8 to 30 1/2. It offered $13.50 in 
cash or stock for Portland, Ore.-based Fabricland, another fabric retailer. 
Fabricland rose 2 1/4 to 12 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
In London, shares firmed slightly by the close following a stronger early trend 
on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares closed 
3.9 points higher at 2,161.8. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany, stocks ended little changed. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-share DAX index rose 1.54 points to 1,477.41. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks rose in thin trading despite concerns over the Persian Gulf 
crisis that helped to depress some other Asian share markets. 
</P>
<P>
The key 225-share Nikkei average closed up 336.11 points at 24,424.02. But by 
midday today, the Nikkei was up 455.60 points to 24,879.62 on news of the Fed's 
interest rate cut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Swiftness of Cut Boosts Bond Prices 
</P>
<P>
A cut in the discount rate propelled bond prices sharply higher as traders 
applauded the Fed's action and anticipated that the central bank would take 
further steps to loosen credit. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond surged 1 1/4 points, or $12.50 per 
$1,000 in face amount. Its yield plunged to 8.07% from 8.18% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The credit markets had expected the Fed to take some action to lower interest 
rates because of the weakening economy. But traders were surprised and 
impressed by the swiftness of the announcement, coming immediately after a Fed 
board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact it came the day of the meeting . . . is indicative of the extent to 
which the Fed is concerned about the depths of the current recession," said 
Ward McCarthy, analyst at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight loans between banks, 
fell to 7.25% from 7.3125% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Declines in Late Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell moderately against most foreign currencies as the Federal 
Reserve cut interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
However, traders said the dollar's decline was cushioned by the continued 
potential for a war in the Persian Gulf to disrupt foreign economies heavily 
dependent on imported oil. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at 1.478 German marks in New York, down from Monday's 1.487. 
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar fell to 132.72 from 133.10. 
</P>
<P>
It cost $1.9305 in New York to buy one British pound, unchanged from late 
Monday. In London, sterling rose to $1.9350 from $1.9290 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Freeze Fears Lift Orange Juice Futures 
</P>
<P>
Prices of orange juice futures jumped in panicked buying on the New York Cotton 
Exchange as forecasts for a frosty Christmas weekend in much of the country 
triggered memories of last year's disastrous Florida freeze. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts and meteorologists said fears of a similar killing frost in the 
next week were unfounded because freezing temperatures from the cold wave are 
unlikely to reach Florida and the orange harvest is running far ahead of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen concentrated orange juice futures prices settled 4.9 to 5.75 cents 
higher, with the contract for delivery in January up 5.75 cents at $1.10 a 
pound, a four-week high. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, light sweet crude oil settled 40 to 81 cents higher, with January at 
$27.86 a barrel; gold ended 40 cents to $1 lower, with December at $376.50 an 
ounce; silver was 0.1 to 0.4 cent higher, with December at $3.96 an ounce.

VIACOM, TIME WARNER TO MERGE COMEDY CHANNELS; 
</P>
<P>
CABLE TV: EACH COMPANY WILL OWN HALF OF THE COMBINED EFFORT. THE DEAL IS THE 
LATEST EXAMPLE OF CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two competing cable-TV comedy channels, which have struggled to gain acceptance 
among viewers, advertisers and local cable systems, will merge into a single 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
Viacom International's Ha! channel, on the air since April 1, and Time Warner's 
Comedy Channel, launched in November, 1989, plan to pool their assets under the 
name Comedy TV by early next year, the companies said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement to merge the two channels, which faced costly and debilitating 
competition until they became profitable, is the latest example of 
consolidation within the cable TV industry. 
</P>
<P>
The business climate for cable has become increasingly uncertain in recent 
months as the industry faces the prospect of reregulation, tighter credit from 
financiers and a slowdown in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been very expensive for us to push on. We were doing a very good 
job of standing each other up," said Viacom President Frank Biondi at a press 
conference in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Viacom and Time Warner had been having on-again, off-again discussions 
regarding the merger of the two comedy channels for a year. But talks had 
broken off over issues of control, as well as acrimony stemming from Viacom's 
$2.4-billion antitrust lawsuit against Time Warner and its Home Box Office 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at both companies, however, said the merger agreement was not linked 
to a settlement of the lawsuit. Time Warner operates the Comedy Channel through 
its HBO unit, while Viacom runs Ha! through its MTV Networks subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner and Viacom will each own 50% of Comedy TV, with a programming 
lineup culled from both Ha! and the Comedy Channel. The two channels have taken 
different programming approaches, with the Comedy Channel using more of a 
video-clip format similar to MTV's while Ha! has relied upon sitcom reruns as 
the backbone of its schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The merged channel is to be staffed by employees from both companies, but 
Michael Fuchs, chief executive of HBO, acknowledged there will be "some 
consolidating" of positions. A new president for the channel will be recruited 
from outside either company, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Comedy Channel is available to 8.5 million homes and Ha! is in 6.5 million. 
The companies said the merged channel would have a subscriber base of about 15 
million. Biondi said the merged channel could become profitable when it reaches 
between 20 million and 30 million homes, depending on ratings and advertising 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area, the Comedy Channel is available to slightly over 
100,000 households and Ha! reaches 190,000. 
</P>
<P>
Erica Gruen, senior vice president at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising in New 
York, observed that, at current subscriber levels, neither channel "inspired a 
stampede of advertising in their direction." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that 15 million subscribers "creates a stronger impression in an 
advertiser's mind," although it is still far short of the more than 50 million 
homes that receive successful cable networks, such as ESPN, CNN, USA Network, 
MTV and Nickelodeon. 
</P>
<P>
In the past month, a shakeout of the cable-TV industry has hit new and emerging 
networks. Last week, Denver cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. said it had 
shelved plans to buy 50% of the ailing pay channels Showtime and the Movie 
Channel for $225 million, which are also owned by Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
And on Monday, Mizlou Communications shut down its Sports News Network because 
it was unable to attract enough subscribers. Last month, two competing cable-TV 
courtroom channels still on the drawing boards said they would merge. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a limited market for cable networks with similar type of 
programming," said Lisbeth Barron, vice president at S. G. Warburg &amp; Co., 
an investment firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, executives at each comedy channel maintained that they would 
wage their battle until the bitter end, and neither network was under pressure 
from its parent to give up and cut its losses. But eight months of head-to-head 
competition has taken its toll. 
</P>
<P>
HBO's Fuchs said the Comedy Channel has run up about $40 million in losses so 
far. Three years ago, he noted, the Comedy Channel "would have been a slam 
dunk." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, five months before Viacom was launched on April Fools' Day, 
officials said the company would spend $45 million to buy old sitcoms and 
movies for Ha! and could lose $100 million over the next three years. In the 
second quarter, Ha! cost Viacom $18.2 million in start-up and operating 
expenses, and in the third quarter it suffered another $10.5-million operating 
loss.

AST STOCK PRICE SOARS AFTER EARNINGS PREDICTION; 
</P>
<P>
COMPUTERS: IN THE MIDST OF THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO POST 
PROFITS OF $13.9 MILLION FOR ITS SECOND QUARTER, NEARLY DOUBLE THAT OF A YEAR 
EARLIER.

<P>
Despite an economic slowdown that has hurt other computer companies, AST 
Research Inc. surprised Wall Street on Tuesday by forecasting a near doubling 
of its earnings for the quarter ending Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street traders and investors, hungry for a hot company in the midst of a 
recession, sent AST's stock price soaring 20.8%, or $5.50 a share, to close at 
$32, its highest price of the year. The stock was the sixth most-actively 
traded issue in the over-the-counter market Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The personal-computer maker said it expects to post earnings of $13.9 million 
for its second quarter, up from $7.4 million a year earlier, a performance that 
analysts say is remarkable, given the poor state of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
AST attributed its higher earnings estimate to increased sales, especially 
overseas, higher profit margins and improved operating efficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
"The company's complete line of high-performance personal computers has 
attracted strong demand from our distributors, resellers and customers 
worldwide," said Safi U. Qureshey, AST co-chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
The company also authorized a 2-for-1 stock split effective Jan. 31. The 
company said the action is intended to attract a larger and more diverse group 
of shareholders and to increase trading volume of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
As of Dec. 17, AST had 13.9 million common shares outstanding. After the stock 
split, the company will have about 28 million shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Candace King Weir, an analyst at C.L. King &amp; Associates, an Albany, N.Y., 
securities firm, said that AST is executing its strategy better than other 
computer firms and that Wall Street is gradually becoming aware of that. 
</P>
<P>
"The estimates are higher than I expected," said Weir, who estimates that AST 
will earn $48 million during its fiscal year ending June 30, 1991, up from 
$35.1 million a year earlier. She said she expects the company to continue to 
perform well in the quarter that begins Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Just two years ago, AST was mired in a computer industry slowdown and had 
reported its first-ever quarterly loss of $8.9 million for the three months 
ending Dec. 31, 1988. The company had a reputation on Wall Street for technical 
excellence but also for not paying enough attention to its balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
The company embarked on a program to strengthen its balance sheet, slashing 6% 
of its work force and trying to bring more financial discipline throughout the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
AST officials say that those cost-cutting efforts begun two years ago have 
prepared the company better than some of its rivals for the current sluggish 
market. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, AST has unveiled a host of high-performance personal computer 
systems to take advantage of improvements in semiconductor technology and is 
targeting customers who were once the domain of the $30-billion minicomputer 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Matheson, an analyst for the Newport Beach investment bank Cruttenden 
&amp; Co., said AST is attracting investor interest because of its strong 
earnings momentum and its aggressive pricing policies, which could draw 
bargain-conscious customers during tough economic times. 
</P>
<P>
AST recently announced plans to enter the notebook-computer market with two 
models priced between $2,500 and $3,300, less than half the price of some of 
its competitors. The machines have been well received in the trade press and on 
Wall Street. The company has also introduced a line of competitively priced, 
high-performance workstations. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 29, AST stock surged $1.50 to close at $27 after Daniel C. Benton, an 
analyst at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. in New York, said in a research report that 
AST could sell 10,000 of its new notebook computers in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
AST has said it is planning to hire 100 additional employees at its Fountain 
Valley manufacturing plant during the next several months to keep up with 
demand for its full line of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter ended Sept. 30, AST reported earnings of $11.4 million, 
up nearly fourfold from $2.9 million a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter 
rose 19% to $136.3 million, up from $114.5 million a year earlier. 
</P>

UCI RESEARCHERS TO STUDY S&amp;L FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The troubled savings and loan industry will go under the microscope in a 
research project headed by two UC Irvine faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Justice has awarded a $240,000 grant to Henry Pontell 
and Kitty Calavita, both of UCI's social ecology department, to conduct the 
first comprehensive study of fraud in the nation's S&amp;L industry. 
</P>
<P>
For the next two years, Pontell, an associate UCI professor, and Calavita, an 
assistant UCI professor, will examine the magnitude, nature and role of 
white-collar crime in the thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
The UCI researchers said their preliminary studies have shown that S&amp;L 
fraud falls into three broad groups which they describe as unlawful 
risk-taking, looting and cover-ups. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, fraud at any institution could encompass all three categories, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers will concentrate on the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles 
(including Orange County), San Francisco, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Houston, Miami and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
They will analyze government reports, transcripts of congressional hearings and 
statistics from U.S. attorney's offices. They also will rely on interviews with 
regulators and prosecutors, and will try to identify ways to improve 
regulations and law enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
There is no indication that they plan to interview current or former savings 
and loan executives.

PEOPLE: MURDOCH QUITS AS DIRECTOR ON REUTERS BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reuters Holdings PLC announced that Rupert Murdoch, the media magnate who is 
chief executive of News Corp., has resigned his seat on the board of the 
British news and information agency. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the London Stock Exchange, Reuters said Murdoch, an Australian 
native who became a U.S. citizen several years ago, cited "the pressure of 
other business commitments" as the reason behind his decision to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch, whose business interests range from magazines and newspapers on 
several continents to 20th Century Fox Film Corp. and the Fox television 
network, became a director of Reuters Ltd. in 1979 and a director of Reuters 
Holdings PLC in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
News Corp. has been widely reported to be in deepening financial debt, 
primarily brought on by a number of acquisitions that Murdoch has engineered. 
In 1988, News Corp.'s U.S. subsidiary acquired TV Guide, the Daily Racing Form 
and Seventeen magazine from Walter Annenberg's Triangle Publications in a deal 
valued at $3 billion.

THE LOVE-IN THAT ALMOST STOLE CHRISTMAS; 
</P>
<P>
20 YEARS LATER, PARTICIPANTS AND POLICE SHARE MEMORIES ABOUT LAGUNA'S 
'WOODSTOCK WEST'

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Expectations of a Christmas "love-in" -- a Woodstock West -- drew 25,000 people 
to Laguna Canyon 20 years ago this week. But when the love festival had became 
a weeklong party and guests still refused to leave, police donned riot gear, 
sang "Here Comes Santa Claus" and broke it up. 
</P>
<P>
Even in a community known for its tolerance, the event panicked city officials 
and some residents who feared the surge of people descending on the small city 
could cause a riot. The police response: to close off Laguna Beach on Christmas 
Day, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"We ruined a lot of people's Christmases. They couldn't come in and visit their 
families because we closed this place down," said Police Chief Neil Purcell, 
who was then fresh out of sergeant's academy. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd that gathered in the canyon that December was eclectic -- longhaired 
youth mixed with servicemen, Vietnam veterans with Hells Angels. Some of the 
young people were naked; one elderly woman wore fur. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the passage of time, those involved in the rock festival still have 
clear memories of the event. One recalled LSD tablets fluttering down from an 
airplane like snowflakes. Another remembers a hilltop silhouette of police in 
riot gear. 
</P>
<P>
The drama began in early December with a rumor that thousands of youth would 
soon wind their way to Laguna Beach. It ended Dec. 28 when an abandoned 
campsite was bulldozed and set ablaze by police. 
</P>
<P>
Between the rumor and the blaze, an estimated 25,000 people were drawn to 
Laguna, almost tripling the city's population and setting city officials' 
nerves on edge. Music and marijuana filled the canyon air, seven babies were 
born and two people died. 
</P>
<P>
The key players in The Happening have since found a way to categorize the 
experience. Then-City Manager Larry Rose calls it the consummate challenge of 
his career. Police Chief Purcell says it was a turning point in Laguna's 
history. For participant Beth Leeds, it was simply the best Christmas of her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a huge star we called the Star of Bethlehem. It hung over and none 
of us could sleep it was so bright," says Leeds, a Laguna Beach resident who 
helped organize the event. "This was like the young people celebrating 
Christmas the way they wanted to, in spite of the fact that every single step 
along the way there were policemen or city officials telling them they couldn't 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
If the festival was a dreamy celebration of Christ's birth to Leeds, it was 
something less benign from the city manager's point of view. Rose received word 
in early December that posters had materialized on the East Coast inviting 
people to a Christmas love-in on Laguna's Main Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"In a matter of days we began to get the impression that the whole world was 
coming to Laguna Beach," Rose said. Worried about crowd control and the 
potential for riots, he turned to Kenneth Huck, then the police chief, for 
help. "I said: 'What are we going to do? We've got to get prepared. We've got 
to do something.' " 
</P>
<P>
Word of the festival hit the underground press. Rock stations passed it on. 
Calls to the city multiplied. Where is Laguna? callers wondered. Does the 
Greyhound bus stop there? 
</P>
<P>
"It began to build," Rose said. "There was clear evidence we were going to get 
thousands of people there." 
</P>
<P>
Just 16 months before, 400,000 young people had flooded a White Lake, N.Y., 
farm for the Woodstock Music and Art Fair. Laguna began to brace itself, 
fearing that a "Woodstock West" was about to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounding communities were called for help. Local police started working 
12-hour shifts. The city brought in an armored tank. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we began to prepare ourselves in a military sense, actually," Rose 
said. "We were preparing to defend the business district." 
</P>
<P>
The city got its first big break when a narcotics officer infiltrated a group 
of locals, convincing them that the canyon would be a better place for a rock 
festival than Main Beach, Rose said. Now they had a game plan: funnel the youth 
into the canyon and seal off the city. 
</P>
<P>
"By that time, I had gotten extremely desperate," Rose said. "We were 
approaching Christmas. They were showing up." 
</P>
<P>
Purcell remembers Christmas Day 1970 vividly. A "command post" for 450 officers 
had been set up at Laguna Beach High School. From Dec. 20 to Christmas Eve, 
police had been working 20-hour shifts, Purcell said. On Christmas Day, they 
stopped going home at all. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials still thought The Happening might fizzle, Purcell said. But 
when Christmas dawned, all doubt evaporated. Youth by the thousands began to 
stream into the canyon -- in cars, in converted school buses and on 
motorcycles. Some came on foot; at least one arrived on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, it's like they came out of nowhere," Purcell said. "They were 
here." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, police say, 500 cars an hour were rolling into the city en route 
to the canyon clearing known as Sycamore Flats. "By about noon Christmas Day, 
we had approximately 25,000 young people in town, attempting to get there, or 
on the site," Purcell said. 
</P>
<P>
Barricades sprang up at every entrance to the city -- on Coast Highway and on 
El Toro and Laguna Canyon roads. "We didn't let anybody through. Nobody," Rose 
said. "We had gotten to the point where I decided 'We are not going to blink.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Purcell added, "We really had a serious situation on our hands." 
</P>
<P>
It was a different situation for those quarantined among the sycamores along 
500 acres near the intersection of Laguna Canyon and El Toro roads. Douglas 
Miller, a sailor on liberty at the time, had hitchhiked to Laguna from San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It was harmless enough," said Miller, now a Laguna Beach resident. "It was the 
thing to do. You really missed out if you didn't go. I think it was really 
wonderful, but the city was really neurotic about it." 
</P>
<P>
An impromptu community erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Tents were erected for shelter, trenches dug for toilets. A large tent went up, 
furnished with cots, to treat drug overdose victims. Free food was served 
several times a day. 
</P>
<P>
At night, when temperatures dipped to the 30s, weary celebrants huddled in 
sleeping bags near fires. 
</P>
<P>
The big-name stars that rock fans had hoped to see didn't show. Only drummer 
Buddy Miles appeared to entertain the crowd. Amateur performers took turns on a 
wooden stage, putting a balky sound system to use. The crowd accepted them, 
said Roger Van De Vanter, a La Quinta resident who lived in Laguna Beach at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I just remember everything was so passive and sedate, without any form of 
violence whatsoever," he said. "I just thought it was kind of an interesting 
way of life that was going to be the future of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Drugs were plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
LSD, hashish, Thai sticks and opium were all on the menu, Van De Vanter said. 
"Hippie chicks" in see-through garments skipped gaily through the crowd with 
baskets of LSD. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just bouncing along with big smiles on their faces, with braids in 
their hair with flowers in it," he said. "If you ever thought you were coming 
down, you could get more whenever you wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, a plane buzzed the canyon and LSD tablets stuck to postcards 
fluttered through the sky. "It just looked like a bunch of little birds in the 
air," Purcell said. 
</P>
<P>
By Dec. 27, police and city officials were fed up. Some had worked several days 
straight and had missed Christmas with their families. Although thousands of 
festival participants left when the city offered to bus them elsewhere, Purcell 
said that about 2,500 had established what amounted to "squatters' rights." 
</P>
<P>
"We decided it was time to move them out," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Leeds recalls the chilly morning of the 28th as a sharp intrusion on a peaceful 
memory. She was cooking oatmeal at daybreak when she saw the first row of 
policemen in riot gear silhouetted on the ridgeline. As one row moved down the 
hill toward the bleary-eyed campers, another row appeared, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were encircled," Leeds said. A police helicopter hovered, belting out a 
message: 'Disperse. This is an illegal assembly,' " she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hell that morning," Leeds said, "after this most beautiful thing." 
</P>
<P>
It was less beautiful from Purcell's point of view. He recalls campers 
"mooning" the aircraft and making obscene gestures. A few people burned flags, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But with police arriving in waves, the party was finally over. The campers were 
herded onto the highway, marched into town and loaded onto buses. 
</P>
<P>
That afternoon, police bulldozed "everything in sight," Purcell said, including 
hundreds of tents, thousands of sleeping bags and a couple of cars. Everything 
was burned to the ground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then they took the tally: In the three days the youth claimed the canyon, 
Purcell said, there were scores of drug overdoses, seven births and two deaths 
-- one from an overdose, the other from a motorcycle accident. The discoveries 
of the bodies jarred the community, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when this city decided that will never, ever happen again," Purcell 
said. "I feel it was a turning point. It woke a lot of our citizens up. 
Enough's enough. We're a pretty tolerant community, but there was no way that 
we can tolerate this type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Greenbelt president Elisabeth Brown, who hikes in Sycamore Hills, says 
traces of The Happening still linger. 
</P>
<P>
"There're still suitcases and bits of clothing stuck way back in bushes that 
have been there for years," she said. "It was a disaster for the environment 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
But for Douglas Miller, the Laguna Beach rock festival is a memory to cherish. 
Someday, he says, he will sit down with his two young sons and tell them about 
the Christmas of 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just an adventure, really," Miller said, "part of growing up."

Stacie Smith looks like a typical 9-year-old. She wears fashionable clothing 
and a smile from ear to ear that could make any Christmas Grinch smirk. 
</P>
<P>
But at her young age, Stacie has endured three years of cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
With her illness diagnosed as acute lymphocytic leukemia, Stacie has received 
chemotherapy, undergone bone-marrow spinal-tap aspirations and had a tube 
inserted in her chest to receive her medicine. Having completed her treatment, 
Stacie is now in remission. The pretty girl with long, shiny hair now enjoys 
horseback riding, swimming, soccer and softball. 
</P>
<P>
A cancer diagnosis can be devastating, not only for the victim but also for the 
entire family. This is where the Kids Cancer Connection Inc. steps in to help. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based program, founded by parents whose children have suffered 
cancer, helps families deal with the pain of the disease, assists children 
returning to school during and after treatments, provides scholarships for 
children requiring continuing education and supports cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
The Kids Cancer Connection's primary fund-raising program, the "Glad Tidings" 
holiday greeting-card program, is currently under way. 
</P>
<P>
The program is now in its second year of operation, and this year's cards have 
been colorfully designed by Orange, San Diego and Los Angeles County children 
being treated for cancer. The cards contain original inscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Stacie's greeting card features a fluffy lamb looking hopefully at the North 
Star. The sentiment inside says, "Do you hear what I hear . . .?" This is the 
second year Stacie has contributed artwork to the fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we did about $220,000 worth in sales," said Michele Massey, 
executive director of the Kids Cancer Connection. "Last month alone we sold 
$65,000." 
</P>
<P>
A committee chooses artwork. The prospective artists are sent instructions, and 
when all the artwork is received, Massey and a group of volunteers select the 
ones that will be printed. 
</P>
<P>
Massey has already received letters inquiring about submitting designs for next 
year's cards. A letter from a parent in San Marcos read: "My son has cancer. He 
wanted to know maybe next year if he could send in a design." 
</P>
<P>
The cards are available at the Orange County Marketplace, on the Orange County 
Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa; I. Magnin and Bernans, both in South Coast Plaza in 
Costa Mesa; and South County Re/Max offices. Orders can also be sent directly 
to the Kids Cancer Connection. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, call (714) 851-7774. 
</P>
<P>
The Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation in Orange also offers holiday greeting 
cards created by children with cancer. Funds from the cards are used for 
research conducted at the Pediatric Cancer Research Laboratory at Children's 
Hospital of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Co-chairwoman Bonnie Dankberg thinks the foundation, now in its fourth year of 
greeting-card sales, will sell 145,000 cards this year. 
</P>
<P>
Cards are available at Nordstrom and Vons Pavilion stores throughout Orange and 
Los Angeles counties and at the Pediatric Cancer Research Laboratory office on 
the second floor of CHOC Tower in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
To inquire about the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation, call (714) 532-8692.

HEALTH WOES RUN RAMPANT IN MISSISSIPPI DELTA; 
</P>
<P>
RURAL SOUTH: NUMBING POVERTY, SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND LACK OF EDUCATION ARE 
BLAMED. IN SOME CASES, BLACKS ARE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN FOOD AND MEDICINE.

<P>
On a spring afternoon seven years ago, a man arrived at Dr. Anne Brooks' clinic 
near the Tutwiler, Miss., post office with a sore back. He'd been chopping 
cotton in a nearby field -- moving methodically up and down the rows, digging 
weeds with a hoe. Like most of Tallahatchie County's residents, he was black. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of principle, Brooks, a Catholic nun who trained as an osteopath, 
likes to suggest ways for patients to help themselves. In this case, her 
instinct was to recommend that the man spend the weekend in bed, putting hot 
towels on his back now and then. She thought for a moment, then asked if he had 
hot water. 
</P>
<P>
"No ma'am, I don't," he told her. "But I can heat the kettle." How? she asked. 
"I'll go outside, haul the water and chop some wood," he said, "then start a 
fire." Brooks told him to rest in bed, and perhaps ask a friend to rub his 
back. 
</P>
<P>
I had gone to Tutwiler, a town of 1,176, in the hope of learning why black 
Americans, in Mississippi and across the rural South, are less healthy and 
dying younger than their white neighbors -- what physicians call excess 
morbidity and excess mortality. 
</P>
<P>
For two weeks, I crisscrossed the Delta in search of doctors, nurses and 
public-health officials who might provide answers. I could as easily have gone 
to any of seven other Southern states, from North Carolina to Louisiana, that 
make up the so-called stroke belt and have the highest infant mortality rates 
in the United States. But in the Delta, where blacks constitute about 70% of 
the population and many are desperately poor, the problems are the most 
concentrated of any region in the country. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 400 miles, from New Orleans to Memphis, U.S. Highway 61 roughly 
parallels the Mississippi River and passes within 20 miles of all but one of 
the towns I visited. It was my lifeline, the road to which I constantly 
returned, for most of these towns are too small and too poor even to have a 
motel of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Time and again I discovered situations as complex and frustrating as Brooks' 
attempt to treat her patient's aching back. In the Delta, health and medicine 
are linked inextricably to numbing poverty, lack of education and a social 
structure in which many blacks remain fundamentally powerless, unable to 
control their own lives. All of these forces are as entwined in local culture 
as the ivy that overwhelms abandoned buildings scattered across the landscape. 
If the pain of Brooks' patient cannot entirely be attributed to race, neither 
can race be absolved: White people do not chop cotton, and most white people do 
not live in houses without stoves and running water. 
</P>
<P>
I learned, most of all, from the stories I heard. One nurse told me about a man 
who stood at the edge of a field waving a white flag to let a crop duster know 
where to spray, wearing only a T-shirt and jeans to protect him from raining 
poison. A physician described a patient hospitalized with massive 
gastrointestinal, urinary tract, liver and skin ailments after a spring wind 
soaked him with herbicide he was pouring into a container. 
</P>
<P>
In Mound Bayou, I heard about a man who lost his manufacturing job because he 
missed work to get X-rays, and one doctor told me of women whose employers 
"don't want them to go to a doctor even if they're half-dead." I heard of 
people forced to choose between food and heart medicine, because they didn't 
have money for both. 
</P>
<P>
When black people in the Delta seek medical care, it's not in an integrated 
health-care system but a haphazard patchwork assembly -- one held together by 
too few physicians and fewer specialists. Their efforts are undermined by 
employers who fail to provide insurance, and Medicaid and Medicare systems that 
inadequately reimburse doctors and leave many patients uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that the medical problems we face here in the Delta are a whole 
lot different from the medical problems any place in our country," Brooks said. 
"I think people are sicker longer before they get help, because of lack of 
money and transportation. When we finally get them in the hospital they're much 
worse off." 
</P>
<P>
Poverty is the most overwhelming cause of poor health among black people in the 
Mississippi Delta: They are ill because they don't have to the resources to 
remain well. "Your wealthier people, with cars, they can travel to Clarksdale, 
to Memphis, to Oxford," said Dr. Marilyn Aiello. "But your poor become very 
sick and die. I can't tell you how many people come into the clinic who have 
never seen a doctor, and are seriously sick -- not so much any more, because 
I've been here almost 10 years. But in the beginning it was very commonplace. 
They just wouldn't go, because it was so hard for them to go."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid signs of new financial health after its worst cash crisis and buoyed by a 
turnabout in cooperation from the City Council, the Grove Shakespeare Festival 
announced Tuesday that it will present an enlarged 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
The classical troupe will offer six plays by subscription next year, one more 
than this year. They are Christopher Hampton's "Les Liaisons Dangereuses," Tom 
Lehrer's "Tomfoolery," Thornton Wilder's "Our Town" and Shakespeare's "The 
Merchant of Venice, "Measure for Measure" and "The Taming of the Shrew." Dylan 
Thomas' "A Child's Christmas in Wales," the perennial holiday show, will be a 
non-subscription offering. 
</P>
<P>
The season announcement followed the council's unanimous agreement Monday night 
to extend the Grove's current management contract for the indoor Gem and the 
outdoor Festival Amphitheatre -- both city-owned facilities -- for six months 
beyond its expiration date of June 30. Further, the council directed the city 
staff to accommodate a Grove request for a change in a clause of the contract 
that enables the city to order the troupe out of the facilities simply by 
giving 90 days' written notice. 
</P>
<P>
By extending the contract to Dec. 31, 1991, and seeking a mutually acceptable 
termination clause, the council allayed any fears by Grove officials that its 
1991 schedule could be disrupted in mid-season by an arbitrary order to vacate. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year some members of the council made a point about the possibility of 
canceling our season," Grove artistic director Thomas F. Bradac said Tuesday. 
"That point had never been made before, and we wanted to guarantee our 1991 
subscribers that they could buy season tickets without any qualms." 
</P>
<P>
The city staff will meet with Grove officials and will make a recommendation to 
the council on Jan. 7 for "new language in the contract that protects both 
parties," Deputy City Manager Michael D. Fenderson said. "The council said it 
agrees with what the theater is trying to do and wants to accommodate it but 
wasn't sure about the exact language for mutual protection. Maybe we'll put 
something in about the season or something that requires cause (to vacate). 
That will depend on what the lawyers advise." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever contractual language is decided upon for the termination clause, 
Fenderson added, it will probably be incorporated into a new five-year contract 
also currently under negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
That contract would take effect after Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bradac said the programming choices for next season were made with 
an eye toward "artistic challenge" and "commercial viability," despite the fact 
that several of the selections are so familiar as to constitute a common diet 
for high school productions and community theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"The Merchant of Venice," one of Shakespeare's more difficult plays to do well, 
was "the most requested" of the Bard's works in an audience survey conducted by 
the Grove last January, Bradac said. "We've never done it," he noted. "It will 
be our 13th season next year, and I think it's time." 
</P>
<P>
"The Taming of the Shrew" also ranked high in the survey, Bradac said. Although 
the Grove did it once before -- in 1985 -- he said the domestic comedy about 
arranged marriages should help widen the theater's audience base because "it 
tends to draw people who do not usually attend Shakespeare plays." 
</P>
<P>
The riskiest of the three outdoor productions scheduled for the 550-seat 
amphitheater in terms of popular appeal, he said, is "Measure for Measure." 
While it is a comedy, it is not light entertainment. "It is very political and 
has a lot of darkly sexual undercurrents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Les Liaisons Dangereuses," which leads off the season at the 172-seat Gem, has 
been widely seen in two recent movie versions and in many local stage revivals. 
But, Bradac maintained, Hampton's 1986 adaptation of the 18th-Century 
epistolary novel about sexual intrigue "takes a classical company to do well." 
And, he added, "we chose it because it's an intimate play -- no pun intended -- 
that will fit comfortably on the Gem's (small) stage." 
</P>
<P>
As for Wilder's "Our Town," the 1938 Pulitzer Prize-winning play about a New 
England village called Grover's Corners, Bradac does not mind that it is 
frequently mounted by local amateur troupes (and recently had a major San Diego 
production). "I've been wanting to do an American classic for years," he said. 
"This one is among the great plays of the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
"Tomfoolery," a satirical musical revue of songs from the '50s and '60s by Tom 
Lehrer, was staged last season at the Gem. "That is the third most popular show 
we've ever done there," Bradac said. Only this season's offering of "The 
Importance of Being Earnest" and the perennial "A Child's Christmas in Wales" 
have done better. 
</P>
<P>
If Bradac and the Grove board seem more conscious than ever of commercial 
considerations in choosing the programming, they have good reason. The worst 
cash crisis in the 12-year history of the nonprofit company, Orange County's 
second-largest professional troupe, nearly forced it to shut down in October. 
</P>
<P>
The great irony of that trauma, Bradac said, is that "it looks like we'll be 
ending in the black for the first time in at least three years because of new 
fund raising, cutbacks in expenditures and 'Earnest,' which earned about $7,000 
more than we anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Grove expects to retire a $41,000 deficit carried over from last 
season, which caused the cash crisis in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in so much better shape than we were at this time 12 months ago, I can't 
tell you," Bradac said. "We won't have that albatross when we begin next 
season."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE EFFECTS OF TV VIOLENCE: WHO'S TO SAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defending the television industry is a filthy job, but somebody has to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Take that new law that President Bush signed encouraging the networks, 
independent stations and cable operators to reason together and "voluntarily" 
set guidelines for violence on TV. Take it and dynamite it. 
</P>
<P>
Although such dealing in smoke-filled executive suites would normally violate 
antitrust statutes, the new legislation grants the industry a three-year 
exemption so that it can come up with a plan to curb TV violence: How much can 
be shown, when it can be shown and all of that. 
</P>
<P>
It's about time, you're saying. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows that the din of TV violence long ago reached ear-splitting 
levels while becoming the industry's substitute for creativity. And it goes on 
and on. When, for example, CBS recently announced it was aborting its new 
late-night news program "American Tonight" as a regular series, what did it 
announce as a replacement at 11:30 p.m.? Five nights a week of something called 
"Crime Time." Good night, and pleasant nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
As if there weren't enough "crime time" heading 11 p.m. newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
So . . . a law championing less knock-'em-down? Less shoot-'em-up? Less blood 
and gore? Fewer bruises and fewer bodies? It sounds like a grand idea, you say, 
and you're on your feet applauding. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it's a terrible idea. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, it's just about impossible to set standards for violence in a 
reasonable manner. Oh, sure, you could ban it from the early-evening TV that is 
most accessible to kids. But what about newscasts that air when kids are likely 
to be in the vicinity? No violence there, either? 
</P>
<P>
Even more basic, what is violence? A car chase? Blowing up an empty building? 
Two brothers wrestling in a sitcom? The Three Stooges? 
</P>
<P>
And establishing that, what then? Let's see, how about four violent acts per 
hour in a drama? Or if a family drama, one? Or a 10 p.m. crime drama, five? Two 
murders and three beatings? Or shall we just flat-out seal off the airwaves 
from reality by putting all of TV off-limits to violence? 
</P>
<P>
And failing that, what constitutes good violence as opposed to bad violence? 
This season's acclaimed PBS documentary series "The Civil War" was enveloped in 
an aura of violence. Was that bad? "Tour of Duty," a former CBS series about 
the Vietnam War, was definitely too violent, according to the media-monitoring 
organization run by the Rev. Donald Wildmon in Tupelo, Miss. Should violence be 
eliminated from war shown on TV, or just crime? 
</P>
<P>
And what about hockey? Football? There's no telling how many killing machines 
the Super Bowl has created among viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, no one in the industry admits that TV violence even is a problem, 
making industry response to the new legislation difficult to gauge. 
</P>
<P>
The law's undertone is that of a general ordering a private to volunteer. You 
don't have to, but. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the industry fails to act on its own, then "we look at other options," said 
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who co-sponsored this legislation. But he isn't 
specific about those options. "I don't want to go down the path of censorship," 
Simon has said. 
</P>
<P>
That's heartening. Nevertheless, the threat of government intervention in 
program content -- an onerous prospect -- is implicit here. 
</P>
<P>
It's one thing -- and quite proper -- for the Federal Communications Commission 
to establish limits on how many minutes of commercials can run in children's 
programs (as it did recently) or to insist that stations meet their obligations 
by regularly airing certain broad categories of programming that are in the 
public interest. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it's quite another thing for the government to meddle in content, which is 
what this law could portend. That is just too high a price to pay for pacifying 
the airwaves. And that it's civil libertarian Paul Simon who stepped out of 
character to push hardest for this legislation, instead of Jesse Helms, makes 
it no more acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, but it's based on a flawed premise. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing other voices, Simon contends that "the evidence is overwhelming that TV 
violence adds to violence in our society. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, about as overwhelming -- and firm -- as jello. A myriad of studies has 
proved inconclusive. Except in rare cases, such as a rash of Russian roulette 
deaths seemingly tied to TV showings of "The Deer Hunter" in the early 1980s, 
there is simply no empirical evidence that TV violence in fiction or news feeds 
real-life violence by turning viewers into homicidal monsters. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it desensitizes us. Or perhaps it frightens us out of proportion to any 
actual threat. But makes us more violent? 
</P>
<P>
Like others before him, Simon may be confusing violence with aggression, which 
can range from shouting at the motorist who cut in front of you on the freeway 
to little kids sticking their tongues out at each other. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of all the protestations, the fact remains that the public has an 
enormous appetite for violence, whether on TV or in theaters, where a string of 
bloody mob movies is proliferating through the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
It's traditional to seek a scapegoat for society's problems rather than 
searching for the actual causes. But we can't blame TV -- a mere 50-year-old 
infant -- for making the world unsafe and ungentle. It wasn't TV that motivated 
God-fearing citizens to turn out in droves for public hangings in days gone by. 
It wasn't TV that motivated settlers to drive American Indians from their 
homelands in the 19th Century. It wasn't "The Untouchables" or "Hunter" that 
inspired the Nazis to slaughter their 13 million victims. Did TV create 
apartheid, Stalin, Idi Amin, Papa Doc, the Khmer Rouge or even Saddam Hussein? 
</P>
<P>
Besides, despite an explosion of TV violence in the last decade, most of TV 
remains nonviolent, with many more of its programs promoting goodness than 
savagery. Therefore, if TV is so persuasive, if, as Simon and others claim, TV 
violence creates a more violent society, why doesn't its more prevalent 
nonviolence make us a more nonviolent society? 
</P>
<P>
Is it that our brains discriminate? Do we lap up TV's bad influences and resist 
its good influences? 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there's irony in all of this. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, you have President Bush signing legislation advocating 
standards for violence on TV, on the premise that exposure to too much violence 
is harmful to us. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, you have President Bush readying the nation and United 
States forces in the Persian Gulf for the ultimate in violence -- war. 
</P>
<P>
If the United States does indeed go to war with Iraq, combat coverage -- 
depending on restrictions placed on the media by the Pentagon -- will probably 
swamp TV. But don't watch. It could be bad for you.

GETTY BECOMES A REFUGE FOR VICTIMS OF WAR; 
</P>
<P>
ART: CONSERVATORS SAVE DAMAGED ROMANIAN TREASURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The J. Paul Getty Trust may be known as an ivory tower, but it is developing a 
new image as an enlightened good neighbor. The Getty can't care for the entire 
globe's cultural heritage any more than it can buy all the treasures offered 
for sale, but it can become a catalyst for international cooperation as it 
adopts a world view of where its money should go, trust officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do it all, but we are constantly looking for ways that we can make a 
significant difference, and to get the most bang for the buck," said Harold 
Williams, director of the trust. Going it alone is not necessarily the best 
answer, according to Williams, who speaks of "leveraging" resources and 
"collaborating" with other institutions as the Getty creates a distinctive 
place for itself in the international art community. 
</P>
<P>
The latest example of this expansive point of view could hardly be more 
dramatic. Four Italian paintings from the National Art Museum of Romania in 
Bucharest that sustained drastic damage during the Romanian revolution last 
December are undergoing treatment in J. Paul Getty Museum's conservation 
laboratory. Romanian conservator Simona Predescu, who has come to Malibu for 
six months, is working with Getty staff to restore these survivors of war. 
</P>
<P>
The most highly revered -- and the most severely damaged -- is "Young Mother," 
a luminous painting of a woman nursing a baby by Orazio Lomi Gentileschi. A 
strip of canvas about 3 or 4 inches wide was ripped out of the lower 
mid-section of the painting by a bullet that penetrated a wall of the museum. 
One section of the severed strip fell to the floor and was saved, but another 
portion burned up and must be re-created, Predescu explained. She will work 
with Getty associate conservator Elizabeth Mention to rejoin the salvaged piece 
and to make a replacement for the missing part. 
</P>
<P>
The conservators must fashion a patch of canvas that matches the texture and 
weight of fabric used for the original painting, then join the patch and the 
salvaged piece by attaching threads around the edges with a synthetic resin. 
After building up a gesso background on exposed canvas areas, Mention will 
paint in the blank spots with the help of photographs. The treatment will also 
include a thorough cleaning, removing a border that was added to enlarge the 
painting and replacing a late 19th-Century canvas lining. 
</P>
<P>
Daunting as the task appears to be, the situation could have been much worse, 
Mention said. If the mother's and baby's faces had been lost, the painting 
probably could not have been saved. 
</P>
<P>
Another victim of the Romanian revolution, a Bolognese School "Allegoric Scene" 
attributed to Carlo Nuvolone, was torn by gunfire on its lower right corner. 
Genovese painter Luigi Miradori's "The Guarding Angel," in which an angel shows 
a kneeling man the differences between heaven and hell, was riddled by flying 
debris. Its entire surface was roughed up and dozens of holes appeared where 
paint got so hot that it blistered and dropped off. The fourth Romanian-owned 
painting at the Getty is Pietro da Cortona's "Virgin With Child," which was 
bombarded by particles of broken plaster and other materials when a shell 
exploded inside the museum. 
</P>
<P>
The bullets that flew through Bucharest last December were aimed at human 
targets and many of them hit their marks. After a week of bloodletting that 
started in the western town of Timisoara and wound up in the capital city, 
thousands of Romanians had been felled and dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was 
destined to join the dead. But the uprising also wreaked havoc on cultural 
treasures, Predescu said. The country's most valuable cache of art was in the 
National Art Museum of Romania, unfortunately located next to a prime target: 
the presidential palace in the heart of Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
This complex of government buildings was the site of intense combat. Machine 
guns battered the museum from the outside, ripping through paintings as they 
penetrated thick walls. Combatants who hid inside the museum were snuffed out 
with more firepower, which filled the galleries with shrapnel, smoke and flying 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
When the fighting finally ceased, the museum's four conservators were faced 
with the devastating sight of fried, pock-marked, shredded artworks. Hundreds 
of pieces were damaged -- some beyond repair, others only in need of cleaning, 
Predescu said. 
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Romanian cultural leaders subsequently came to the United 
States, seeking aid but also establishing contacts with American colleagues. 
Several Getty administrators and staff members have visited Central and Eastern 
Europe during the past year as well, to determine what help is needed. As a 
result of these exchanges, four paintings were selected for treatment at the 
Getty. Several Dutch paintings are undergoing conservation at the Rijksmuseum 
in Amsterdam and some Italian works are expected to be treated in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of mounting an independent salvage operation, the Getty invited a 
Romanian conservator to visit the laboratory and join in the work. Predescu 
prevailed over a senior colleague because she could speak English and drive a 
car -- two important survival skills in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"As important as these paintings are, it's more important that the conservator 
has come here," Williams said. Giving Predescu access to the latest in American 
conservation techniques and technology, an experience that she will take home 
to Bucharest and share with her colleagues, is a way of leveraging the Getty's 
support, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Predescu noted that her studio in Bucharest is too small to accommodate large 
artworks and that the museum's equipment is relatively primitive. There are no 
X-ray facilities like the Getty's which examined the damaged paintings. Instead 
of relining paintings with heat-activated adhesives on a modern vacuum table, 
as Getty conservators do, Predescu said she uses an iron and natural glue. 
</P>
<P>
Predescu is highly skilled, however, and Getty conservators say they are 
benefiting from the exchange as well. "We don't see damage like this. It's a 
great experience for all of us," said conservator Mark Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to learn all they can about the visiting paintings, Getty 
scientists will analyze microscopic samples of paint chips to determine the 
kinds of ground coats and pigments used, the structure of layers and disclose 
other information that may prove useful in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Our collection is quite well cared for, so we hope to do more of this," 
Leonard said, pointing out two other painting conservation projects that have 
been accepted in exchange for showing the works at the J. Paul Getty Museum. 
</P>
<P>
One, Agnolo Bronzino's Mannerist "Portrait of a Young Man," is already cleaned 
and on view at the museum. The painting, which belongs to the Nelson-Atkins 
Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., was recently treated in the Getty lab by 
Nelson-Atkins conservator Scott Heffley. The other project concerns "Mars and 
Venus Surprised by Vulcan" by Paris Bordone, a large painting from the 
Staatliche Museen in West Berlin, which is awaiting treatment by Getty 
conservators. 
</P>
<P>
These collaborations are typical of a trust-wide effort to find appropriate 
ways to be of service and advance scholarship, said Deborah Gribbon, associate 
director for curatorial affairs at the Getty. "It's important to emphasize that 
we are not aiding the needy. These are genuine colleagues with whom we have 
been out of touch. We want to find out what help they think they need," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Determining what help is needed and establishing priorities can be difficult, 
however. Deborah Marrow, director of the Getty's grant program, said that 
grants to Central European scholars are under consideration and noted that her 
program is being scrutinized to see if it suits the needs of such applicants. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still sorting out the situation," said Williams, who has visited 
Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia. "It is traumatic to move into a free market 
because of inflation, problems with fuel oil and the specter of unemployment. A 
lot of institutions are over-staffed . . . and many are looking at a 20% cut 
(in spending power)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The severity of the problem was sharply illustrated by a visit to a university 
in Krakow, Williams recalled. "I asked if they would like significant support 
for the university library, and I was told, 'Of course, but we have 750 art 
history students and we don't even have a slide projector to show them 
artworks.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Getty will probably provide the slide projector, but "there are no quick 
fixes," Williams said. Still, "it's clear that even a small amount of aid has a 
big impact in terms of morale," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One thing the trust plans to do is to co-host (with the Mellon Foundation in 
New York) a meeting of foundations that want to help Central Europe. "These are 
people who don't talk to each other," Williams said, expressing the hope that 
bringing them together "to exchange views might avoid duplication and make them 
more effective."

'MARKSMAN' MARK WHITFIELD KEEPS HIS EYE ON THE TARGET; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: THE GUITARIST, WHO WAS WEANED ON ELLINGTON AND BASIE, FINDS THAT 
RE-CREATING PAST SOUNDS MAKES HIM A GOOD LIVING IN THE PRESENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"When I left school and went to New York," said the 24-year-old guitarist Mark 
Whitfield, "I had accepted in my heart that I was going to play jazz, and live 
in a small apartment in Brooklyn and just be poor for the rest of my life. 
Anything else that happened would just be a lucky break." 
</P>
<P>
As luck would have it, something else did happen. Three years ago, when the 
Berklee College of Music alumnus was jamming at a New York Club, George Benson 
heard him. Before long he was on tour with organist Jack McDuff (Benson's first 
band leader) and, through Benson's intercession, had a contract with Warner 
Bros. Records. His first album, "The Marksman," in which he is backed by Wynton 
Marsalis' rhythm section, is selling briskly. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, after a grueling but gratifying 3 1/2-week tour of Japan dueting 
with Carmen McRae, he came home to his not-too-small apartment in Baton Rouge, 
La., where he lives with his wife and 8-month-old son. Over the weekend, he 
arrived in Los Angeles to play his first two Southland dates, Tuesday at 
Elario's in La Jolla and tonight at Nucleus Nuance in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Whitfield is a maverick who shuns fusion, opts for straight-ahead jazz, and 
whenever possible avoids amplifiers. "I'm having a guitar made," he says, with 
a microphone mounted on the inside and using a wireless set-up, so I won't need 
an amp at all. That natural sound blends better with the other acoustic 
instruments." 
</P>
<P>
Raised in Lindenhurst, Long Island, Whitfield came to jazz by natural causes: 
Two parents who loved the music, raised him on Ellington and Basie records, and 
once took him to hear the Count Basie Band, where upon he fell in love with 
Freddie Green's acoustic rhythm guitar. 
</P>
<P>
"My high school band director was also a jazz fan and had played in big bands. 
A teacher in Seattle, where I lived for a year after my parents moved there, 
had played with Earl Hines. He gave me my first Charlie Christian record. I was 
15." 
</P>
<P>
Playing in the school band, he won two Berklee prizes and was offered a full 
scholarship, moving to Boston to study there in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The experience was a mixed blessing. "The school's emphasis has changed to 
fusion. Out of the 1,000 or more guitarists who passed through Berklee during 
my four years there, I doubt that more than 10 or 15 put a serious effort into 
playing straight-ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Much of his jazz wisdom came from the records of George Benson and such 
long-gone masters as Charlie Christian and Wes Montgomery. His mind and fingers 
remain planted firmly in the mainstream. He scorns the theory that equates 
fusion with progress, or his own creative style with nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a spontaneous music in which nothing is ever played the same way 
twice; except the style may seem nostalgic to people who grew up with it, but 
for me it's new. What the fusion players are doing -- John Scofield, Mike 
Stern, guys like that -- I wouldn't call an improvement in any way on what Wes 
Montgomery did back in the 1960s. They are good musicians, but they don't 
represent any advance." 
</P>
<P>
Whitfield realizes that the music he has embraced encompasses a broad range of 
tastes. He has begun to develop as a composer; six of the nine cuts in the 
album are his own, and at least two, "Medgar Evers Blues" and "The Marksman" 
(the title cut) shows substantial promise. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of his discovery by Benson have come other delights, among them a 
record date for RCA with Cleo Laine that found him in the company of trumpeter 
Clark Terry and saxophonist Jane Ira Bloom. Betty Carter has sat in with his 
group. Carmen McRae, who first heard him last summer at the North Sea Jazz 
Festival in Haarlem, plans to bring him back to Los Angeles in February to play 
with her at Catalina's. 
</P>
<P>
Half a century has passed since Charlie Christian, in his historic sessions 
with Benny Goodman, set the course for modern jazz guitar. Mark Whitfield is 
one of a welcome minority whose roots go clear back to those catalytic 
recordings.

BUSH CALLS FOR A PEACE FORCE AFTER GULF CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Whether or not war is averted, the international community must deploy "some 
kind of peacekeeping force" in the Middle East to guarantee long-term stability 
and ensure that Iraq can never again mount a military threat, President Bush 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein relents and withdraws entirely from 
Kuwait, there can never be "simply . . . a return to the pre-invasion borders 
or the status quo there," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Bush spoke, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. 
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, set out on a trip to Saudi 
Arabia to consult with senior U.S. commanders and Saudi officials. 
</P>
<P>
The President's remarks in a press conference, and additional comments by Vice 
President Dan Quayle, reflect White House thinking on the role of U.S. forces 
and other military units in the Persian Gulf after the current crisis is 
resolved, either militarily or diplomatically. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the concern is that if a diplomatic solution is found, or even 
after a limited war, Hussein could end up retaining his arsenal of chemical and 
biological weapons, as well as the capacity to produce nuclear weapons in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to cope with the question . . . of increased nuclear 
capability today beyond what it was several years ago," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, in a speech to a conference of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, 
said that "once Iraqi forces have left Kuwait . . . and once the legitimate 
Kuwaiti government has been restored, our job will still not be over." 
</P>
<P>
"Having tried to erase an entire nation from the face of the Earth, Saddam 
cannot simply walk away without penalty and (be left) in a position to repeat 
his aggression," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he 
and others in the Administration have "begun to do some thinking, some specific 
work . . . in terms of what a long-term security arrangement would look like." 
Another official said that those involved include Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III and Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility, the senior official said, is a deployment of forces sponsored 
by the United Nations and made up mostly of Arab forces. "That's pretty much 
what our thinking is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A White House official said some discussions have been held about the makeup of 
an international peacekeeping force with the partners in the coalition arrayed 
against Iraq, but "it's more of a concept than a reality." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign troops deployed under the U.N. flag have long been scattered throughout 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has 5,800 troops on Lebanon's southern border with Israel 
and another peacekeeping force on the Sinai Peninsula. In addition, 2,100 
troops sponsored by the United Nations serve as a buffer between Greeks and 
Turks on Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to sensitivity in the region to any suggestion that the massive U.S. 
military deployment would bring about a long-term presence of U.S. forces, Bush 
said any peacekeeping units would be international, "because I think there's a 
problem if U.S. forces remain on the ground in the gulf for some time." 
</P>
<P>
But he said that naval units protecting the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of 
the Persian Gulf have "been there for a long time; we will continue to stay 
there." 
</P>
<P>
The President grew suddenly animated when he defended the makeup of the U.S. 
force in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
To the suggestion that a disproportionate number of those in the front lines 
are from minority groups, Bush replied: "This argument that there's some kind 
of racism . . . in this deployment -- I reject it. . . . It is simply not true. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't believe me, believe Colin Powell; and he has pretty good 
credentials in this field, outstanding credentials," Bush said, referring to 
the Army general who is the first black chief of staff. "So I want to gun it 
down just as hard as I possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
He said there is "a lot of truth" to the allegation that the draftees sent to 
Vietnam represented "kind of the lower rungs of society." 
</P>
<P>
"This is different," Bush said, describing the current Army as one made up of 
"the finest kids, the best trained, the best motivated, the high achievers -- 
not the low achievers." 
</P>
<P>
Bush acknowledged that "you'll read about one or two that say, 'Well, I didn't 
sign up to do this; I signed up because I thought I could get a free 
education.' He gets on the Phil Donahue Show, a big hero. That's the tiny 
fraction of these kids that are over there. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't some cop-out armed services that they are now getting caught up in -- 
something that they were unaware of," he added.

GERMANY'S DISTRESSING SPY STORIES; 
</P>
<P>
WITH UNITY, OFFICIALS HAVE LEARNED THAT EAST GERMANY INFILTRATED ALMOST EVERY 
NICHE OF THE BONN GOVERNMENT. THOUSANDS OF CIVIL SERVICE WORKERS APPARENTLY 
WERE RECRUITED.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It did not end like cloak-and-dagger stories are supposed to, with briefcases 
exchanged on foggy bridges or midnight dashes across nameless borders. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, one of the most thrilling chapters in Cold War espionage closed with a 
German nursery rhyme sung by a lonely, drunken spy: 
</P>
<P>
"All my little duckies, swimming on the pond . . . heads deep in water, tails 
to the sky." 
</P>
<P>
The bizarre shortwave broadcast from East Germany to its legion of spies around 
the globe that evening last May 23 hid a sobering message. 
</P>
<P>
The game -- their game -- was over. 
</P>
<P>
And just how well they played it is only now coming to light. 
</P>
<P>
Just over two months into unity, the Bonn government is discovering to its 
amazement and embarrassment that all three West German intelligence agencies 
harbored double-agents at high levels, and that this rampant treachery for 
decades provided the East Bloc a treasure trove of Western secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence analysts say the damage is impossible to assess, and defense 
attorneys for the alleged spies being arrested on an almost daily basis argue 
that German unification makes it all moot, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every niche of the West German civil service apparently had moles on 
the payroll of Communist East Germany's secret police, the Stasi, whose lust 
for information was so consuming that the agency even bugged the church 
confessionals of its own countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
"We now figure they recruited 5,000 to 6,000 agents in West Germany. We thought 
they only had 3,000," said Peter Frisch, vice president of the country's 
internal security agency, the Federal Office for Protection of the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
The real surprise, though, was that so many West Germans turned traitor. 
</P>
<P>
Recruitment techniques varied. During the late '70s and early '80s, for 
example, East Germany planted handsome young men in West Germany to woo unwed 
secretaries in ministries. At one point, the so-called Romeo escapade included 
four secretaries working in the office of the West German chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
On other cases, West Germans, such as senior counterintelligence official Klaus 
Kuron, approached the East Germans and spied for money. Kuron doubled his 
income during the eight years he admittedly worked as a double-agent for East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Still others spied for ideological reasons. Diplomat Hagen Blau told 
investigators he had been an impassioned leftist since his student days in 
Berlin, where a friend who joined in the cafe debates confided to Blau that he 
was a Stasi member. 
</P>
<P>
The "friend" waited two years before turning Blau, who was then embarking on 
his foreign service career. Blau would spend the next 30 years supplying the 
East Germans with West German documents and information concerning foreign 
policy, purportedly rebuffing all offers of payment until the very end. 
</P>
<P>
A common language and culture, as well as West Germany's open-door policy for 
East German refugees, gave East Germany a unique advantage in espionage, 
intelligence experts say. 
</P>
<P>
And although West Germany also had no language or cultural barriers to cross, 
the closed society and iron-fisted Communist rule made it far more difficult 
for West Germans to plant their own spies in the East, and far more dangerous 
for East Germans to turn traitor. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in West Germany, the infiltration was so thorough, according to 
Frisch, that even the home telephones of at least one-third of his agency's 
2,500 employees proved to be tapped by the East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
"They also had the capability of listening in on all telephone traffic between 
West Berlin and East Germany," Frisch said, adding that about 25,000 telephones 
in West Germany could also be scanned by East German computers. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors are now investigating hundreds of cases and have made more 
than 100 arrests so far, more than triple their usual caseload. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take years to unravel," said an intelligence source speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence officers say the KGB no doubt reaped a gold mine of information 
over the decades from its loyal East German ally. 
</P>
<P>
"The East Germans were just about the KGB's most reliable allies," said Chris 
Andrew, a Cambridge professor who wrote, "KGB: The Inside Story." 
</P>
<P>
He described the scale of East German spying on West Germany as "simply 
astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
"They were pretty blatant about it," he added in a telephone interview. "East 
German Radio would nightly broadcast messages for 'moles.' The head of East 
German foreign intelligence, Markus Wolf, had the reputation of being the 
ablest foreign intelligence chief." 
</P>
<P>
Wolf, who has an arrest warrant pending against him in Germany, recently 
finished a book titled, "I'm No Spy." He is said to be in exile in Moscow, 
hoping for amnesty from Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
He has hinted in interviews published by the German press that some of his 
ex-agents still remain unexposed in Bonn government circles. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who was familiar with the West German scene and the zeal with which 
the East Germans pursued their recruitment efforts had to realize that the West 
German government was very porous and easily penetrated," said former CIA 
Director George Carver. 
</P>
<P>
"With each wave of revelations, you had to realize there would be another one," 
added Carver, now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He said Germany's NATO allies were "very well aware of the German problems" in 
intelligence matters, and "you adjusted yourself accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
Lutz Stavenhagen, the junior minister in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government 
responsible for intelligence services, refused several requests by The Times 
for information about the growing spy scandal. The chancellor's office and the 
government press office also refused to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no political fallout from the spy revelations, although the 
intelligence agencies themselves and many politicians readily acknowledge that 
the damage is more widespread than that from the notorious case of Guenther 
Guillaume, the East German mole planted in then-Chancellor Willy Brandt's 
office. Guillaume's unmasking in 1974 resulted in a scandal that forced Brandt 
to resign. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence sources say the fall of the Iron Curtain and loss of so many 
valuable East German agents is forcing the KGB to revamp its network. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course they're still spying," one of the sources said of the Soviets. "But 
probably we'll see their interests focus much more intensely on the industrial 
level. They're generations behind in high technology and can't afford the 
licenses and royalties to obtain such information legally." 
</P>
<P>
Bonn intelligence officials say the KGB already has taken over an undetermined 
number of the agents and the Stasi files. But the Bonn officials are concerned 
about the great numbers apparently left behind in hiding, seeing them as 
potential targets of KGB blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
"They were only offering sanctuary to the very top agents," a West German 
intelligence source said of the KGB. "What use would the others be to them now 
back in the Soviet Union? They can't even feed and shelter their own people, 
let alone thousands of former German spies." 
</P>
<P>
According to Frisch, the Soviets had a plane waiting in East Berlin two days 
after German unification to whisk away the biggest double-agent unmasked so 
far, Kuron. 
</P>
<P>
Kuron, who had been in charge of handling "turned" East German spies for West 
Germany, changed his mind at the last minute and called his employers at the 
Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution to confess. 
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old Cologne father told investigators he had dropped a letter in 
the mail slot of East Germany's mission in Bonn eight years ago because he 
needed money to finance the education of his four sons. The East Germans paid 
him 500,000 marks (about $335,000) over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Kuron claims the Communists agreed not to arrest any of the agents he 
identified, only to limit their access to secrets. But one of the East German 
double-agents did end up in jail after another high-ranking West German 
double-agent defected. The East German died in prison under mysterious 
circumstances. Communist authorities said he committed suicide. The West German 
traitor now lives in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
German law limits access to criminal suspects, and attempts by The Times to 
interview any of the admitted spies awaiting trial were fruitless. Their 
defense attorneys for the most part argue that no damage was done, since the 
two Germanys are now united and the Cold War is over. 
</P>
<P>
Still unresolved is just what should be done with a generation of crack spies 
who, thanks to German unification, have been left out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament is expected to debate soon about giving amnesty to East German 
spies, informants and Stasi members, but such clemency is unlikely to cover 
West Germans who worked for the very people winning pardon. 
</P>
<P>
Among those charged so far are Kuron; Gabriele Gast, an officer with the German 
equivalent of the CIA who helped prepare weekly intelligence briefings for 
Chancellor Kohl and was caught trying to flee across the Austrian border, and 
Blau, a career diplomat who admitted he had been working for the East Germans 
for nearly 30 years while posted in London, Tokyo, Sri Lanka and the Bonn 
Foreign Ministry. Blau was recently sentenced to six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-Stasi agents also revealed that the deputy chief of the West German military 
intelligence agency, MAD, spied for the East Germans for at least 10 years 
before leaving the service in 1984. The man, Joachim Krase, has since died. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry acknowledged in a statement that the damage was "critical" 
and effectively blocked the agency's gathering of military intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a simple case of treason," Gerd Komossa, former head of MAD, wrote 
in a commentary for the daily newspaper Die Welt. "Through him, the Stasi not 
only got a glimpse of our defense; our methods were betrayed here." 
</P>
<P>
The editorial page editor of Die Welt, Enno von Loewenstern, wrote recently 
that "it is a frightening phenomenon that men in high positions, apparently 
tried and tested, betrayed their country with apparently no more scruples than 
a traveling salesman switching to another brand." 
</P>
<P>
Kuron's confession led to the immediate arrest of eight other suspected spies, 
and investigators say others are cooperating as well, including several 
ex-Stasi officers who have come forward to offer names and files in hopes of 
currying favor with their new government. 
</P>
<P>
A special hot line exists for spies to turn in themselves or other agents. 
</P>
<P>
"The flood is yet to come," said Werner Hecker, the Koblenz attorney who 
defended Blau. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's possible there are other big ones out there," agreed Frisch, who 
also didn't rule out the possibility that his own agency may still harbor 
"another Kuron." 
</P>
<P>
"Every area was hit in spectacular fashion -- political, economic, military," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Werner Hecker, the attorney for diplomat Blau, said his client spied out of 
"pure ideology" and was personally thanked by Markus Wolf for his service. But 
the diplomat became disenchanted with East Germany's hard-line Communism in the 
'70s and at some point did accept $10,000 for his work, Hecker said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to stop, but couldn't. They were always pressuring him for more 
information, for better information. They wanted him to try to go here or 
there," Hecker said. 
</P>
<P>
Blau became an alcoholic, he said, and although his problem was well-known 
enough to prevent his promotion, it did not result in his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
He never spent the $10,000, tucking it instead amid the stacks of his 
10,000-volume private library which included, according to Hecker, a number of 
volumes on Marxism and Leninism. 
</P>
<P>
Kuron, on the other hand, was considered a model civil servant. 
</P>
<P>
"He passed all security checks," said Frisch. "He didn't drink. His wife was 
faithful. He lived in an ordinary row house in Cologne and had a vacation condo 
in Spain just like plenty of other Germans. There was nothing remarkable about 
his lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
Little is known about Gast, the alleged spy from the Federal Information Agency 
(BND), the equivalent of the CIA, who helped prepare weekly briefings for Kohl, 
which the East Germans apparently previewed. 
</P>
<P>
All employees at the BND work under cover names and are discouraged from 
socializing with one another, a government source said. 
</P>
<P>
"She would have been able to say what we knew, but not who told us," the source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Criminal Office, which recently had an officer of its own arrested 
on espionage charges, has said that East Germany paid its West German agents 
going-out-of-business bonuses of up to $13,600 each. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the traitors were low-ranking civil servants who supplemented their 
incomes as secretaries, clerks or computer operators with secret salaries paid 
by the East Germans for copied documents and computer discs, investigators say. 
But with the Berlin Wall now in ruins and East-West tensions eased, the secret 
life of thousands of outwardly ordinary people will simply disappear. 
</P>
<P>
One spy who came in from the cold sees the era as over. 
</P>
<P>
"Why spy? I ask myself that now," mused Guenther Guillaume from the elegant 
living room of his luxurious home in what used to be East Germany. Guillaume, 
after serving 7 1/2 years in a West German prison, was released in a spy swap 
between the two Germanys a decade ago. "Satellites can get it all, anyway."

Last year, four in every 10 adult suspects arrested by the Los Angeles Police 
Department for the most serious crimes had either felony or misdemeanor charges 
filed against them. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, the filing rate was double that, department records show. 
</P>
<P>
Discretion exercised by prosecutors, The Times found, is a major factor. 
</P>
<P>
Certain felonies that once were tickets to state prison today are rejected for 
prosecution by the district attorney's office. They are sent instead to the 
city attorney as possible misdemeanor filings -- for which the guilty usually 
serve no more than a few weeks in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the city attorney's office has become more selective, pursuing with 
less vigor many minor violations of the law -- from bounced checks to the theft 
of video rental movies. 
</P>
<P>
With the number of arrests on the rise, many prosecutors say they must exercise 
greater discretion when choosing which criminal cases to file in court and 
which to discount or dismiss altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line, court and police records show, is a boon for many who break 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, 30% of all adult suspects arrested in Los Angeles for so-called Part I 
crimes -- homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and 
vehicle theft -- had felony charges filed against them. By 1980, the rate 
dropped to 21%. By 1989, it was 17%. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of misdemeanor charges resulting from Part I arrests has 
declined even more dramatically -- from 60% in 1980 to 23% in 1989, Police 
Department records show. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner nor City Atty. James K. Hahn could explain the 
declines. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, meanwhile, said he was "perplexed and disturbed" 
after being shown computer-generated charts prepared by The Times, based on 
annual Police Department statistics, demonstrating the decline. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't realize the data had changed that much," Gates said. "That's a real 
indicator to me that either we're not doing the job in providing good arrests 
or good investigators, or we're not getting the attention from the prosecutors 
that we should be getting. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Gates has ordered an internal inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
A Police Department statistician last week theorized that a 1986 change in the 
department's methods of tabulating arrest data may be skewing the filing rates. 
A police spokesman said that percentages also may have been affected by a 1986 
law requiring officers to make arrests in domestic violence situations, even 
when prosecution is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Several deputy district attorneys, however, said that if anyone or anything is 
to blame for the decline in criminal filing rates, it may be the police 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
With arrests increasing, the quality of many Police Department investigations 
has declined, prosecutors said, leaving them little choice but to reject 
outright or try to settle by plea bargain a growing number of cases that cannot 
be won in court. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the district attorney's office filed a case in which a convicted 
robber on parole, Orlando Hawkins, was accused of aiming a shotgun at a retired 
Los Angeles police officer and his son, then robbing them of their sports car. 
When the case was assigned to Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Latin, he said he soon 
discovered that the investigation was "kind of screwed up." 
</P>
<P>
Latin said the police had shown the victims a photographic lineup of six 
suspects known as a "six pack." Both victims picked Hawkins. The photo of 
Hawkins' head, however, "was three times as big as everybody else's," according 
to the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
As other weaknesses in the case became apparent, Latin said, he tried to avoid 
a trial by offering Hawkins progressively lower prison terms. The initial offer 
was 28 years in prison, according to Hawkins' lawyer, Richard Millard. Latin's 
last offer would have required Hawkins to do about a year in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins rejected each offer, insisting he was innocent. The case eventually 
went before a jury, and he was found not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"The detective in that case was horrible," Latin said. "He left town (on 
vacation) with a bunch of unanswered questions, went to some lake somewhere 
with no telephone, and just kind of left everything hanging." 
</P>
<P>
The detective assigned to the case, Jerry Anslow, disputed Latin's assertion. 
</P>
<P>
"That's bull crap," said Anslow, a 29-year police veteran. "I've never been 
inaccessible for any case. I've (cut short) vacations because of cases." 
</P>
<P>
Anslow acknowledged that the mug shot he used of Hawkins was larger than other 
photographs shown to the victims. The photo, which was the only one available, 
came from another police agency whose mug shots "were a little bigger than 
ours," Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
"These D. A.s are just looking for ways to get out from under the tremendous 
amount of work they have," Anslow said. "There's no preparation for 
three-quarters of the cases because they have too many cases." 
</P>
<P>
Other detectives bristle at assertions that they have slacked off. 
</P>
<P>
"Prosecutorial discretion is the biggest problem in the system today," snapped 
Detective Zvonko G. (Bill) Pavelic of Southwest station. "They will only file 
cases that my 10-year-old son could successfully prosecute." 
</P>
<P>
In May, Pavelic investigated a case in which two 13-year-old girls walking to 
the Crenshaw Mall accepted a ride from three men in a passing car. The girls 
were driven to an apartment, ordered to strip and robbed of their jewelry, 
police said. One of the girls was raped by one of the men. The other was 
ordered to perform fellatio but fled the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Both girls were later able to identify all three suspects. When officers 
searched the apartment, they found jewelry belonging to the girls. 
</P>
<P>
Pavelic interviewed one of the suspects, Travis Lane, 20, who admitted that he 
had sex with the 13-year-old, but said it was consensual. 
</P>
<P>
When the case was submitted to the district attorney's sex crimes unit for 
prosecution, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lydia C. Bodin declined to file charges, 
records show. On her "charge evaluation work sheet" Bodin wrote that the 
13-year-old alleged victim ". . . appears to be 20 yrs. old. Both victim and 
witness appear to be lying. I now have four versions of this case." 
</P>
<P>
Pavelic, however, said there were no inconsistencies when he interviewed both 
victim and witness. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question in my mind this girl was raped," Pavelic said. "And what 
difference does it make how old somebody looks? She's a 13-year-old girl!" 
</P>
<P>
Even though Lane admitted to having sex with a minor, which in itself is a 
felony, the prosecutor told The Times that she decided not to file charges 
because of inconsistencies in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged victim, Bodin said, "laughed during the course of the interview. I 
see victims come in here with nervous laughter, but this was problematic. . . . 
I can't file charges if I don't have a clear idea what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Weeks later, other Southwest station detectives presented Bodin with another 
case in which a 14-year-old girl had been raped at gunpoint before Pavelic's 
investigation. The victim in the second case also identified her assailant as 
Travis Lane. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Bodin filed rape charges against Lane -- not only in the case of the 
14-year-old, but in the matter of the 13-year-old girl whose case she had 
rejected earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Lane in September agreed to plead guilty to the charge of lewd and lascivious 
acts with a child under the age of 14 and received a maximum 8-year prison 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Bodin wait until she reviewed the second rape to file charges against 
Lane? With the second rape, Bodin said, she was able to establish a pattern of 
behavior that strengthened both cases. 
</P>
<P>
Bodin said her decision to reject Pavelic's rape case had nothing to do with 
the fact that she was handling more than a dozen others at the time. "It has to 
do with the quantum and quality of the evidence," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pavelic is hardly convinced. The district attorney's office, he said, 
increasingly finds excuses to reject sex crime cases outright or refer them to 
the city attorney's office for possible filing as misdemeanor sexual battery. 
</P>
<P>
Police Department records show that 44% of suspects arrested 10 years ago for 
rape were charged with that crime or other felonies. By last year, the filing 
rate had dropped to 28%. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody," said Pavelic, "cares about victims anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Bodin disputed the detective's assertion. 
</P>
<P>
"Rape is a tremendously devastating crime," she said. "If we get a fileable 
case, we file it." 
</P>
<P>
On the 17th floor of the Criminal Courts Building outside the district 
attorney's offices, Los Angeles police detectives sit in a waiting room, 
flipping impatiently through home improvement magazines, talking shop or simply 
staring at their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Like patients dreading their turn in the dentist's chair, some detectives 
squirm as they wait for the next available deputy district attorney to consider 
their cases. 
</P>
<P>
It can sometimes be a long wait -- and a fruitless one. 
</P>
<P>
Many detectives complain that these prosecutors, called "filing deputies," who 
do nothing but review case files, are increasingly reluctant to file felony 
charges against suspected criminals arrested by the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, waiting to have a $400,000 forgery case considered for 
filing, Detective Tony Sanchez rolled his eyes when the D. A.'s receptionist 
told him that Allen S. Tyson was the next available filing deputy. "Great," 
Sanchez muttered. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson has such a reputation for turning down cases that some detectives have 
dubbed him "Mr. Reject." 
</P>
<P>
Inside his small office, Tyson was kicked back in his desk chair, talking on 
the telephone to a friend. He did not bother glancing at Sanchez or a Times 
reporter accompanying him that day. The detective opened his briefcase and 
handed over five copies of his report, the number required by D. A. policy. 
</P>
<P>
Without looking up, Tyson casually flipped through the paper work while 
chatting on the phone about his girlfriend, his 11-year-old son and scuba 
diving in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez grew so frustrated with waiting that he left to smoke a cigarette. 
Finally, after more than 15 minutes, Tyson hung up the phone, then looked up 
and demanded, "How in the world could somebody issue four $100,000 cashier's 
checks without asking for any ID?" 
</P>
<P>
When informed that he was asking the question of a reporter and not a 
detective, Tyson said, "Oh," and appeared to blanch. 
</P>
<P>
Upon Sanchez's return, Tyson filed charges in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who said that he is proud to be known as "Mr. Reject," readily 
acknowledged that he has "a tendency" to reject many cases that might be filed 
by other deputy district attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in filing a case just because the cop thinks that the guy's 
going to plead (guilty)," Tyson said. "If we can't make the case, I don't file 
it. It means I'm doing my job, that I'm not a rubber stamp for the cops." 
</P>
<P>
Many detectives say the district attorney's office today almost routinely 
declines to file charges in so-called "one-on-one" cases -- where there is a 
victim and a suspect but no evidence or witnesses to substantiate either side. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one case," said Lt. Richard A. LeGarra at Northeast station. "Maid sees 
a guy coming out of the house next door with a VCR. She jots down his license 
plate. Police respond, check the plate. The guy's a burglar. The D. A. says 
one-on-one -- no corroborating evidence, no fingerprints, (stolen) property is 
not found. No case. So now the guy's back out on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you explain that to a citizen?" 
</P>
<P>
The explanation offered by prosecutors is that crimes without evidence or 
corroborating witnesses can be extremely difficult to prove in court. Why waste 
time with a weak case, they say, when there are so many others where the 
chances of securing a conviction are greater? 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to file cases where we believe we can win it and where we have the 
right guy," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Norman J. Shapiro, who supervises that 
section of the D. A.'s office through which criminal cases are filed in court. 
</P>
<P>
Officers complain that a suspect arrested today while driving a stolen 
automobile in Los Angeles need only claim that he "borrowed" it from a stranger 
to avoid felony vehicle theft charges. Invariably, they say, the district 
attorney's office will reject the case and refer it to the city attorney's 
office for possible filing as a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
Filed as a felony, vehicle theft is punishable by as many as three years in 
state prison. As a misdemeanor, it is good for no more than a year in county 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro denied that the district attorney's office routinely rejects car theft 
cases. He acknowledged, however, that in some instances, cases are rejected 
when it cannot be proved that a suspect took the car or drove it knowing it was 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Cases involving car break-ins, officers say, are given even less attention by 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Officers assigned to the Police Department's K-9 unit tell of an August, 1989, 
incident in which they arrested a suspect caught burglarizing a vehicle in a 
West Los Angeles towing yard. 
</P>
<P>
When officers checked records, they discovered that the suspect, Alejandro 
Chavez, had been arrested three weeks before in the same lot for the very same 
crime but that the district attorney's office had declined to file charges for 
unspecified reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"The D. A.'s office should be commended for their total lack of integrity or 
job performance," Officer Larry Mallet wrote in a report after the arrest. 
"Their inability to exercise their responsibilities has become nothing less 
than a joke." 
</P>
<P>
Even after the second break-in, there are no court records indicating that the 
district attorney filed charges against Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
A person who steals anything worth more than $400 in California can be charged 
with grand theft, a felony that carries a maximum three-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, officials in the district attorney's office say they have 
neither the time nor the attorneys to pursue grand theft cases unless the item 
that has been stolen is worth more than $1,000. Moreover, if it is a suspect's 
first theft-related arrest, they say, the loss generally must exceed $2,000 
before grand theft charges will be filed. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's his first offense and it's a $4,000 loss," said R. J. Fox, a burglary 
detective supervisor in the Rampart area, "I know it's going to go to the city 
attorney as a misdemeanor." 
</P>
<P>
California law also allows those who have been previously convicted of theft to 
be charged with "petty theft with a prior," a felony that carries a maximum 
three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney, however, generally will not file those cases, referring 
them instead to the city attorney, according to Shapiro of the D. A.'s office. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, if somebody committed a $500-to-$1,000 theft, they would 
have likely gone to prison," he said. "There are felonies that citizens 
probably think should be treated as felonies that we don't deal with anymore. 
What can I say? It's not like the D. A. can do any more than we're already 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
In the last 10 years, the district attorney's caseload has more than doubled. 
Last year, more than 51,000 felony cases were filed in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers have become so familiar with what felonies the district 
attorney will and will not not accept, that they routinely "bypass" the D. A.'s 
office, submitting to the city attorney hundreds of cases each week that are 
then prosecuted as misdemeanors in Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
"We are," said Deputy City Atty. Jacquelyn R. Mason, "a trash can for the D.A." 
</P>
<P>
Of 173,327 misdemeanors prosecuted by the city attorney's office in fiscal 
1988-89, 38,976 began as felony arrests referred by the district attorney or 
the Police Department. Many of those cases included sexual assaults, robberies, 
shooting into inhabited dwellings, vehicle thefts, narcotics violations and 
burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
"If your grandfather's watch is stolen, it should be treated as a felony," said 
Assistant City Atty. Maureen R. Siegel, acting head of the city attorney's 
central trials section. "But if it's stolen in Los Angeles, it'll probably be 
filed as a misdemeanor. . . . The system is under a lot of pressure and has had 
to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
Misdemeanors generally are punishable by no more than a year in county jail. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Hahn, however, pointed out that it is often more worthwhile to 
prosecute "wobblers" -- crimes that can be either felonies or misdemeanors -- 
in Municipal Court because judges there are inclined to take such cases more 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"A Superior Court judge may have just finished a death penalty case," Hahn 
explained. "You bring him a wobbler and he's going to say, 'Hey, what's the big 
deal?' He might give (the defendant) straight probation." 
</P>
<P>
Like the district attorney, the city attorney's office has been hard pressed to 
keep up with its yearly caseload, which has grown by more than 50% since 1980. 
The number of city attorney prosecutors, meanwhile, stands at 347, about 30% 
more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to lessen the number of cases that we are dealing with that are 
no big deal in the scheme of things -- cases where nothing's going to happen to 
the people even if we get a conviction . . . ," Hahn said. "We have to draw the 
line somewhere. We only have so many attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
Thus it is, Hahn said, that his office usually declines to prosecute accused 
shoplifters unless the items that they are suspected of having stolen are worth 
more than "$10 or $15." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, if a person walks into a movie rental shop in Los Angeles today, 
checks out an armful of videocassettes and never returns them, the city 
attorney will not file misdemeanor theft charges unless the combined value of 
the tapes exceeds $400. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to play collections agency," said Assistant City Atty. Alice Hand, who 
helps shape the office's filing practices, "but we don't have time anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started 11 years ago as a filing deputy, I would spend all my time 
processing gamblers, beggars, drunk in public, blocking public sidewalks. Now, 
we hardly ever prosecute for those crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, many suspects are issued citations and not taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hand said, the city attorney's policy is that suspects convicted 
today of nonviolent misdemeanors, ranging from car theft to trespass, are not 
required to serve any jail time if they have posted bail or otherwise been 
released from jail before sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
"You probably aren't going to get them to plead guilty if you say, 'Come back 
(to court) so we can put you back in jail,' " Hand said. "You have to have an 
incentive to get them to come back and plead guilty." 
</P>
<P>
People who write checks without sufficient funds in their bank accounts also 
get a break today from the city attorney. Victims who have been defrauded must 
first show that they have received at least two bad checks from the suspect, 
and those checks must total $200 or more before the city attorney will file 
charges, Hand said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to city attorney filing policy, the checks cannot be 
more than a year old. The hitch, Hand and others say, is that after a victim 
complains to the Police Department, a year or more can pass before fraud 
detectives can get to the case and seek charges. 
</P>
<P>
"We're being very selective in the cases we work because we just can't handle 
them all," said Lt. Fred Reno, who commands 20 detectives assigned to the 
Police Department's fraud section. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, I felt I had a sufficient number of people. Today, I don't. Our 
problem is the same as everyone else. We need more people." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the cases handled by Reno's investigators are filed by the district 
attorney's major frauds unit, whose job is to ensure that sophisticated, white 
collar criminals receive maximum prosecutorial attention. However, the district 
attorney's unit has become more selective in which cases it will accept and, in 
the process, has devalued many crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Reno said that 10 years ago the D. A.'s special unit would take on a case if 
the fraud involved $20,000 or more. Today, Reno said, the minimum is usually 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even when cases end up in criminal court, victims often achieve little 
satisfaction in the end. 
</P>
<P>
With prosecutors concerned about more serious offenses, suspects accused of 
these so-called "paper crimes" often end up having to do little or no time in 
custody, records show. 
</P>
<P>
That was the bottom line in the case against James L. Dunson, the former 
manager of five Popeye's Chicken restaurants, records show. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1989, Dunson began submitting the names of fictitious employees to 
Mangen Enterprises, the company that owned the restaurants. The company issued 
payroll checks, which Dunson then forged and deposited in his own bank account. 
</P>
<P>
When owner Howard Mangen uncovered the fraud after five months, he said he 
fired Dunson and called the Police Department. The response, Mangen said, was 
not quite what he expected. 
</P>
<P>
"It took them quite a while to get to it and then I had to do all their work 
for them -- up to and including finding the guy," Mangen said. "There are more 
important, more pressing problems -- the courts are crowded with bigger cases. 
That's what I was told constantly." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in November, 1989, Dunson was arrested and charged with forgery and 
grand theft, each charge punishable by a maximum three years' in prison. He was 
released on bail. 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, Dunson worked out a deal with the district attorney's office 
and agreed to plead guilty. Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan placed Dunson 
on probation and ordered him to pay back Mangen. 
</P>
<P>
The only time Dunson would serve for his first felony conviction would be the 
few hours he spent behind bars before posting bail the day of his arrest. For 
soliciting a prostitute in 1982, a misdemeanor, Dunson got 14 days in jail, 
probation records show. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at the big picture," Tynan said of Dunson's most recent 
sentence. "If you look at what's being tried . . . you understand why we really 
can't waste a whole lot of time on these kinds of cases. We are so burdened 
with serious crime that the smaller property crimes simply cannot be processed. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to make the system work is to negotiate pleas and give the 
defendant something for his plea," the judge said. "Somebody's got to bite the 
bullet." 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, Mangen had not received a dime in restitution from Dunson. 
</P>
<P>
"The system is so bogus, it's ridiculous," Mangen said. "You're better off 
being the criminal than the victim." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Likelihood of Charges Being Filed. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide suspects arrested by Los Angeles police received fairly consistent 
treatment over the years 1980-1989, but those suspected of other serious crimes 
were increasingly likely to be released without being charged. 
</P>
<P>
Rape: An equal number of suspects were charged with felonies as were released 
at beginning of period, but by 1989, more than twice as many were released as 
were charged with felonies. Misdemeanor filings dwindled, too. 
</P>
<P>
Robbery: Releases increased in early 1980's as misdemeanor filings fell. After 
1986, felony filings also fell and releases grew proportionately. 
</P>
<P>
Vehicle theft: A slight trent toward increased felony filings during the period 
is overshadowed by dramatic drop in misdemeanor filings and increase in 
releases. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide: About twice as many suspects were charged with felonies each year as 
were released. AFter 1982, fewer were charged with misdemeanors instead of 
felonies. 
</P>
<P>
Assault: Misdemeanor filings plummeted beginning in 1984. Police officials say 
the decline may be partially explained by a 1986 law requiring that officers 
make arrests in domestic violence situations even when it is unlikely that any 
criminal charges will be filed. 
</P>
<P>
Burglary: Suspects could expect fairly consistent treatment until 1987 when 
releases soared and misdemeanors plummeted while felony filings dropped 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Larceny: Misdemeanor filings were high throughout period, but decreased from 
1986 with corresponding increase in releases.

<P>
The Times Poll: Filing Charges 
</P>
<P>
A majority of Los Angeles' police officers are finding it increasingly 
difficult to get prosecutors to file charges in criminal cases, according to a 
Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
Slightly more than half said they believe that prosecutors usually have good 
reason to reject cases; more than one-in-three officers said prosecutors seldom 
express valid reasons when declining to file charges. 
</P>
<P>
Of police officers questioned, 54% said that it has become more difficult to 
have prosecutors file charges, while 8% said it has become less difficult and 
27% said there has been no change. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, only 6% of prosecutors surveyed said that increasing 
workloads are forcing them to reject more criminal cases. But twice as many 
said that they are more inclined today to plea bargain with accused criminals 
so the cases can be disposed of faster than if the cases were taken to trial. 
</P>
<P>
One in five prosecutors -- and the same proportion of public defenders -- 
acknowledged that with increasing caseloads they are taking less time preparing 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Has it become more difficult or easier to have the District Attorney and City 
Attorney accept cases for filing in court? (Asked of police officers) 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly Difficult: 54%

No Change: 27% 
</P>
<P>
Less Difficult: 8%

<P>
When prosecutors reject your cases, how often do they have a good reason for 
doing so? (Asked of police officers) 
</P>
<P>
Often: 52% 
</P>
<P>
Seldom: 37%

CITICORP TO CUT 4,400 WORKERS, REPORT BIG LOSS 
</P>

<P>
In a fresh sign of how the economic downturn is squeezing banks, Citicorp, the 
nation's largest banking company, said Tuesday that it plans to lay off an 
additional 4,400 workers and expects to report a fourth-quarter loss of between 
$300 million and $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
The new layoffs will bring the total number of employees Citicorp has let go 
since the beginning of the year to 8,000, or close to 9% of its total work 
force of 92,000 at the end of 1989. Citicorp has operations in California, 
including a savings and loan, Citibank FSB, and several commercial loan 
offices. Citicorp spokeswoman Amy Dates said she could not immediately 
determine if some of the layoffs would be in California. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp's projected fourth-quarter loss, after similar deficits by banking 
giants Chase Manhattan and Security Pacific, stems from its setting aside 
additional money to cover bad loans and from the expected costs of its job 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp also said it will cut its dividend to stockholders, a move advocated 
by federal banking regulators to help save cash and make shareholders -- 
instead of taxpayers or customers -- suffer part of the impact of problems at 
weaker banks. 
</P>
<P>
The massive restructuring comes during a time of increasing concern by federal 
regulators about the health of the nation's banking system. A congressional 
report released earlier this week said many banks were insolvent. The Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures depositors against losses, may also run 
into multibillion-dollar losses. 
</P>
<P>
The moves also follow Citicorp's regular annual checkup by federal bank 
examiners, who are understood to have spurred several of the moves announced 
Tuesday, including requiring a big increase in reserves that the bank has set 
aside to cover losses on commercial loans. Citicorp is the parent of Citibank. 
</P>
<P>
Banking industry analysts said the loss reflects the severe downturn in the 
Northeast economy, which has boosted Citicorp's portfolio of problem commercial 
real estate loans. Most analysts viewed the Citicorp move merely as a first 
step and said the company probably will have to cut its profits to make 
additional big provisions to cover loan losses next year. 
</P>
<P>
But Dates said: "We're not making any predictions for next year." 
</P>
<P>
Even with the latest losses, Citicorp's problems are still far from the level 
of severity that have driven many smaller banks into insolvency. Taking into 
account the big loss for the final three months of this year, the firm still 
expects to report net profit for the full year of between $400 million and $500 
million. In 1989, the company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $784 
million but a profit of $498 million for the full year. But it earned $1.86 
billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In its announcement, which it said was sparked by press reports on the banking 
company's financial health, Citicorp said it will slash the annual dividend 
paid on its common stock to $1 per share from $1.78. That will save the company 
an estimated $260 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Charles W. Peabody, a banking analyst at the brokerage firm of Kidder, Peabody 
&amp; Co., said the dividend cut will make it easier for Citicorp to raise 
additional capital it needs through an expected sale to overseas investors of 
$1 billion in new convertible preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
Peabody noted that Citicorp is not alone in facing problems with commercial 
loan losses. "There's no question that there's been a very severe deterioration 
in these loan portfolios," he said. "If the economy continues to slide, that 
portfolio could impair the survivability of some of our largest banks." 
</P>
<P>
These concerns have prompted federal regulators in recent weeks to assess the 
need for new steps to safeguard the industry, including shoring up federal 
deposit insurance. They were also partly behind recent moves by the Federal 
Reserve to ease credit and lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, other big banks have been forced to swallow bitter pills 
because of the sagging economy. Two other giant New York-based banking 
companies, Chase Manhattan and Chemical Banking, also sharply cut their 
dividends and reported steep losses because of increasing loan losses. Chase 
said it was cutting 5,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Los Angeles-based Security Pacific said it expects a fourth-quarter 
loss of as much as $360 million and plans to cut some operations that have a 
work force of 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bank examiners are believed to have ordered Citicorp to increase sharply its 
reserves against commercial loan losses. The company said the reserves -- which 
act as a buffer to absorb losses on bad loans -- will be $340 million for the 
current fourth quarter, an increase of $250 million from the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Raphael Soiffer, a banking analyst with Brown Bros. Harriman, said Citicorp has 
a heavy portfolio of commercial real estate loans made in the New York City 
area, where the real estate downturn has been even more acute than in most 
other areas of the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Peabody and Soiffer predicted that Citicorp will significantly boost reserves 
further, in part because its current reserves are drastically below the 
industry standard. Peabody said the new reserves will cover possible losses on 
only 18% of Citicorp's loans, contrasted with an industry average of 73% and 
about 50% for other big "money center" banks in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Under an international banking agreement, Citibank, like most banks, is under 
intense pressure to increase its capital by the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp stock rose 75 cents per share to close at $14.125 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading Tuesday.

CHOLESTEROL STUDIES BACK DIET, DRUGS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: MEDICINE AND EATING RIGHT CAN HELP REVERSE SOME DAMAGING EFFECTS ON THE 
HEART, NEW RESEARCH CONFIRMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two studies being published today provide encouragement that some of the 
damaging effects of cholesterol on the heart may be reversible through diet and 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Confirming the results of several previous studies of cholesterol in men, UC 
San Francisco researchers have shown that drug treatment and diet can begin to 
clear fatty deposits from clogged heart arteries in both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
Their study, which examined 72 men and women who had clogged arteries but had 
yet to develop heart disease symptoms, is being published today in the Journal 
of the American Medical Assn. as part of a special issue on cholesterol and 
heart disease. Much of the research in the issue was sponsored by 
pharmaceutical manufacturers who make cholesterol-lowering drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Another study in the journal, from the USC School of Medicine in Los Angeles, 
found that men who have had heart bypass surgery can continue to significantly 
lower the rate at which fatty deposits build up in their coronary arteries 
through a combination of cholesterol-lowering drugs and a low-fat diet. The 
results of the four-year study of 103 men extend the two-year USC results, 
which received wide publicity when they were published in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
These trials, along with four others published earlier, "provide evidence that 
treatment will alter the natural history of atherosclerotic lesions -- 
progression of lesions can be slowed, and existing lesions will regress," 
according to an AMA journal editorial by Dr. Basil M. Rifkind of the National 
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md., and Dr. Lawrence D. Grouse of 
Medical Communication Resources Inc. in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
All the studies used angiography -- an X-ray inspection of the inside of the 
heart and blood vessels -- to monitor changes in the degree of atherosclerosis. 
The technique is considered the most reliable way to demonstrate the clearing 
of clogged heart arteries. The trials included many different types of 
patients. They varied in cholesterol levels; some had no heart disease symptoms 
and others had severe symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that high levels of cholesterol in the circulation can 
cause premature atherosclerosis, a form of hardening of the arteries in which 
the inner layers of artery walls become thickened and narrowed by deposits of 
fat, cholesterol and other substances. The two cholesterol-containing molecules 
most likely to cause these changes are known as low-density lipoproteins and 
very low-density lipoproteins. 
</P>
<P>
In the heart arteries, a severe reduction in the flow of blood can have serious 
consequences, such as a heart attack, where heart muscle dies, or angina, a 
chest pain caused by an insufficient blood supply to heart muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Most physicians regard a balanced diet that restricts saturated fats and 
cholesterol and the avoidance of obesity as the cornerstones of preventing 
atherosclerosis. In addition, physicians emphasize the importance of minimizing 
other heart disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure and smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Prescription medications are usually only recommended for patients who cannot 
control cholesterol through diet, such as those genetically predisposed to 
elevated cholesterol levels. These medicines can cost from several hundred to 
several thousand dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
The UC San Francisco study, led by Dr. John P. Kane, included 41 women and 31 
men with elevated cholesterol levels. All were advised to change their diets. 
About half received cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as niacin, colestipol and 
lovastatin. 
</P>
<P>
After two years, the blockage of heart artery lesions increased an average of 
0.8% in the patients treated with diet. It decreased an average of 1.53% in the 
patients treated with diet as well as drugs. 
</P>
<P>
For women, the blockage of the heart artery lesions increased an average of 
1.07% for those treated with diet. It decreased an average of 2.06% in the 
women treated with diet as well as drugs. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 study by another team of UC San Francisco researchers showed that a 
strict vegetarian diet combined with moderate exercise and relaxation 
techniques such as yoga could begin to clear heart artery lesions without the 
use of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Patients in the USC study, led by Dr. Linda Cashin-Hemphill and Dr. David H. 
Blankenhorn, were randomly assigned to treatment with diet and colestipol and 
niacin or treatment with the diet and a placebo pill. After four years, many of 
the patients in both groups had progressive coronary artery disease, but the 
patients treated with diet and drugs generally fared better. 
</P>
<P>
For example, about 15% of the drug-treated patients developed new heart artery 
blockages, compared to about 39% of placebo-treated patients, according to the 
report. And 18% of the drug-treated patients had blockages that started to 
reverse, compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients. 
</P>
<P>
Two other articles discussed the use of cholesterol measurements in children. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the University of Iowa in Iowa City reported on the long-term 
results of a study of cholesterol levels in 2,367 children who were tracked 
into adulthood. The study found that many children with elevated cholesterol 
levels had normal levels when they were tested again as young adults, without 
any specific diet changes or drug treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Many children with high cholesterol levels do not become adults with high 
cholesterol levels," wrote Drs. Ronald M. Lauer and William R. Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
A separate team of researchers at UC San Francisco argued that "children should 
not be screened for high blood cholesterol levels" because the benefits of such 
screening "are unlikely" to exceed the risks. 
</P>
<P>
Among the risks cited by the UC San Francisco researchers, Drs. Thomas B. 
Newman, Warren S. Browner and Stephen B. Hulley, were the expense of screening, 
the potential for family conflicts triggered by abnormal test results, and 
evidence that lowering cholesterol levels later in life "will be nearly as 
effective" in reducing the risks of heart disease. In addition, they cited 
prior studies in adults that have inexplicably linked cholesterol reduction 
with a statistically increased risk of death from accidents, suicide and 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers wrote: "The first two decades of life are a time when many 
other things are more important than cholesterol -- like growth, surviving 
adolescence, and enjoying ice cream."

STATE WILL CUT OFF AQUEDUCT WATER TO L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: ACTION IS TEMPORARY, BUT OFFICIALS WARN THAT IT COULD BE AN OMINOUS 
SIGN. MWD SAYS AREA RESERVOIR SUPPLIES SHOULD BE ADEQUATE.

With lakes and reservoirs in the north continuing to drop as drought conditions 
persist, state officials moved Tuesday to temporarily shut down the huge 
Edmonston pumps that lift water over the Tehachapis into the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
While insisting that the move would have no immediate effect on the 
Metropolitan Water District and its Southern California customers, officials 
acknowledged that it could be an ominous prelude to things to come. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Boronkay, MWD's general manager, said the move was "a bit of a surprise" 
and may prompt him to recommend more severe cutbacks in water deliveries than 
those approved by the district's board. 
</P>
<P>
MWD serves 15 million Southern California residents and 27 local agencies, 
including the city of Los Angeles, and depends on the state water system for 
about three-fourths of its supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we think the state reservoirs in Southern California will be 
enough to continue our needs," Boronkay said. "But we're looking from week to 
week at the state situation and we may have to move to a higher phase or a 
greater cut in our deliveries sooner than we anticipated. This kind of gets our 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
In the first mandatory water rationing imposed since 1977, the district last 
week ordered cutbacks in deliveries averaging 10%, effective Feb. 1, for 
agencies that MWD serves. Boronkay said he may propose cutbacks averaging 17% 
to be put in effect on that date "if the water situation hasn't improved." 
</P>
<P>
"This is just another underscoring of the terribly bad weather we're having," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Mullnix, deputy director of the state Department of Water Resources, 
said that because major storms that usually replenish the northern lakes and 
reservoirs have failed to materialize, officials decided to expedite a shutdown 
of the Edmonston pumps. The pumps are shut down periodically for maintenance, 
but not at this time of year. He said the shutdown would begin today and last 
"a week or so." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there should be mass hysteria about this; it's just one of the 
signs we are experiencing rough times," Mullnix said. "I think people ought to 
be put on notice though that if the lack of precipitation continues in Northern 
California, we're going to be in very, very serious straits." 
</P>
<P>
He said the pumps were being shut down while the state cuts back releases from 
the badly depleted Lake Oroville reservoir on Feather River. He said the 
reservoir, which normally holds 2 million acre-feet at this time of year, now 
has about 1 million acre-feet. An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, or enough 
water to meet the needs of two typical homes for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Water released from Lake Oroville flows into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, 
along with water from other tributaries. From there it is pumped into the 
California Aqueduct and carried south to four reservoirs: Pyramid Lake, Castaic 
Lake, Silverwood Lake and Lake Perris. Boronkay said the district will draw on 
those reservoirs while the pumps are shut. 
</P>
<P>
"There is still quite a bit of storage south of the Delta, or we wouldn't make 
this move," Mullnix said. 
</P>
<P>
He said an additional factor that prompted the move has been cold weather in 
the Northwest that has caused cutbacks in the availability of electric power 
usually purchased at this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Mullnix said that while snow is expected in several weeks, it does not appear 
that there will be major rainstorms. If rain does move in, he said the pumps 
could be reactivated quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have said repeatedly that sudden heavy rains and snows could change 
the water picture dramatically and reduce the need for cutbacks and rationing. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, said Mullnix, "(the shutdown) does mean we're starting to 
tighten our belt."

STATE LEADS NATION IN FILING INJURY CLAIMS FOR AUTO ACCIDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: SOME ANALYSTS SAY CALIFORNIA'S FIGURE -- TWICE THAT OF OTHER STATES 
-- INDICATES FRAUD, BUT OTHERS CITE MORE INNOCENT FACTORS. A SEPARATE STATE 
STUDY SHOWS ATTORNEYS ARE LIKELY TO GET INVOLVED IN SETTLEMENTS.

California substantially leads every other state in the number of bodily injury 
claims paid in proportion to automobiles damaged in accidents, according to a 
nationwide study by the industry-funded Insurance Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
Another study, released Tuesday by outgoing Insurance Commissioner Roxani 
Gillespie, shows that a majority of Californians making injury claims in auto 
accidents are now hiring attorneys to represent them. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the two studies portray California as a litigation-ridden state where 
injury claims are suspiciously high. But there is disagreement in the industry 
over whether the figures represent fraud or a more innocent "buildup," or 
exaggeration, of claims. 
</P>
<P>
The Insurance Research Council study shows that in 1989, insurers paid 55.7 
injury claims in California for every 100 auto property damage claims, more 
than twice the ratio of most other states. The number of injury claims paid per 
100 cars damaged in the Golden State has mounted steadily, from 31.1 in 1980, 
to 39.5 in 1985, to 46.8 in 1987, to the high in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think fraud is too strong a word to use in association with these 
figures," said Bob Mecherle, claims vice president for State Farm, the largest 
auto insurance seller in California and one of the companies sponsoring the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't believe the people of California are the most fragile, delicate 
people in the entire country," Mecherle said. 
</P>
<P>
Other insurers interviewed said they believe the comparative numbers between 
California and other states -- and between the California of 1989 and 1980 -- 
demonstrate at the very least that Californians and their attorneys and doctors 
either are exaggerating the injuries or making claims for injuries that do not 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
John Conners, executive vice president of Liberty Mutual, another study 
sponsor, said, "In states where auto insurance is reasonably affordable, the 
ratio of injury to property damage claims is in the 20 to 25 range. Then you 
look at California and see it's near 56 and up from 31, so someone's attitude 
toward claiming injuries has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Conners said the figures indicate that California "is in a syndrome where if 
you have an accident, you say that your rates are so high that 'I'm a damn fool 
if I don't make a claim.' " Then, he said, the insurers must raise premiums to 
pay all these claims and the cycle goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Release of the Insurance Research Council study preceded by a few days the 
release of the Gillespie study showing that statewide, 57% of those making 
bodily injury claims in auto accidents last year were represented by an 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County had the greatest percentage of cases -- 75% -- handled by 
attorneys, while in Orange County attorneys represented 61% of claimants and in 
San Diego County, 59%. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's study also shows that the frequency of injury claims varies widely 
from county to county, with Los Angeles County 41% higher than the statewide 
average, despite the fact that the frequency of property damage claims in Los 
Angeles County is only 7% higher. 
</P>
<P>
The Research Council study showed that injury claims in California and urban 
areas of other states were much more likely to involve soft-tissue injuries 
that could not be reliably confirmed, such as back and neck sprains, than 
injury claims in other states. And there are many fewer actual hospital stays, 
the study noted. 
</P>
<P>
Such disparities indicate "strange patterns of conduct," said Donald W. 
Seagraves, director of the Insurance Research Council. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that he hesitates to say it is fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"Fraud is in the eye of the beholder," Seagraves said. "If you go to an 
attorney, and he asks for a bunch of medical tests, and costs run up, and he 
uses those higher costs to pump up the settlement, is that fraud? 
</P>
<P>
"We're usually talking about the buildup of claims rather than anything that is 
criminal activity," he said. "That's not a crime under the penal code of the 
United States or the state of California, so I think you have to be careful 
about throwing around terms like fraud." 
</P>
<P>
But, Seagraves added, Californians retain attorneys to represent them in auto 
accident cases about 50% more often than drivers in the rest of the country, a 
practice that leads to higher claims costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Insurance Research Council and Gillespie studies drew criticism from an 
official of the California Trial Lawyers Assn., who suggested they were timed 
to boost proposals for no-fault insurance in the forthcoming legislative 
sessions around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that given the industry's long history of manipulating numbers, 
including rate-setting, the reports' conclusions shouldn't prove too difficult 
to debunk once unbiased research delves into them," said Leonard Esquina, 
executive director of the trial lawyers group. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has repeatedly endorsed no-fault insurance, in which an accident 
victim's claims are paid by his or her own insurer no matter who is at fault in 
the accident. The Insurance Research Council study indicated that injury claims 
are lower in no-fault states. 
</P>
<P>
However, some of the insurers interviewed cautioned that the study gave no 
direct comparisons between states like California, which has a tort liability 
system -- in which the insurers of those at fault in accidents are supposed to 
pay -- and the no-fault states. 
</P>
<P>
They pointed out the no-fault states only count injury claims paid above 
certain dollar thresholds, while California and other liability states count 
all such claims paid, no matter how small. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a spokesman for United Services Automobile Assn. said Tuesday that 
in his company's view the studies "underscore the need for an effective 
no-fault law in California." 
</P>
<P>
"Such a law would eliminate needless lawsuits, return more of the premium 
dollar to accident victims and root out most of the fraud that has crept into 
the California system," said association spokesman George Tye. 
</P>
<P>
He said his company believes that Californians are frequently suing for three 
or four times already inflated medical bills, "creating a lot of needless 
litigation and driving up insurance costs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BODILY INJURY INSURANCE CLAIMS 
</P>
<P>
Listed below are the number of bodily injury claims paid for every 100 auto 
accident property damage claims for each tort state in 1989. In tort states, 
the innocent party in an accident collects from the guilty party's insurer. 
No-fault states such as New York, Florida and New Jersey have different 
accounting systems for bodily injury claims which prevent them from being 
directly compared with the tort states.

Here in the heart of what is commonly called Louisiana's chemical corridor, a 
woman who three years ago questioned the relationship between illness and 
chemical contamination may be paying a price for her candor. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Kay Gaudet, the pharmacist in this city's only drugstore, asked state 
officials to investigate the area's miscarriage rate after logging about 65 
miscarriages out of a population of 2,100 in a 26-month period. According to 
Gaudet, one of every three pregnancies in that period ended in a miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Gaudet's drugstore is closed, a victim of a declining clientele that 
some people believe was part of an economic boycott started by several area 
chemical plants. The industry denies that there was an organized boycott. 
Meanwhile, a study conducted by Tulane University in New Orleans, which said 
that St. Gabriel's miscarriage rate is not abnormal, remains the subject of a 
heated debate in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a boycott, but it was never officially announced," said Peggy 
Hoffman, who suffered a miscarriage. "Kay was a target, she was harassed, and 
some customers told her they could no longer come to her drugstore because 
pressure was being put on them by their employers." 
</P>
<P>
Gaudet has since taken a teaching job in Baton Rouge and no longer talks to the 
press about the miscarriage controversy. "I think she's very discouraged," said 
her husband, Chris Gaudet, a pharmacist at the local prison. 
</P>
<P>
St. Gabriel and the surrounding Iberville and Ascension parishes are the home 
to 15 heavy chemical plants which, along with the dozen or so other plants, 
release as much as 200 million pounds of carcinogens such as benzene, ethylene 
dichloride and carbon tetrachloride annually. 
</P>
<P>
St. Gabriel, situated near the Mississippi River, where 120 more chemical 
plants and refineries dot the map, has been largely a company town since World 
War II, when petrochemical companies built refineries by the riverbank to be 
near shipping lines. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the industries boomed throughout the 1970s and '80s, many 
environmentalists wondered what effect the toxic debris and smoky air were 
having on the local community. "This has long been a state with serious 
environmental problems," said Darryl Malek-Wiley, a former president of the 
Louisiana chapter of the Sierra Club. "It only stands to reason that, with so 
many chemicals in our environment . . . there would eventually be serious 
ramifications with our health. I think Kay's questions pointed in that 
direction and made a lot of people uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
The Tulane study, which was undertaken with state cooperation after Gaudet 
disclosed her miscarriage statistics, said that, out of 430 pregnancies in 
Iberville Parish between 1982 and 1987, 54 were documented miscarriages, an 
almost 13% rate, which one of the Tulane researchers, Jacqueline Clarkson, said 
was "well within the national miscarriage rate." 
</P>
<P>
But researchers for the Center for Environmental Health Studies in Boston this 
summer criticized the Tulane study as "fraught with problems" and said it 
"should be considered inconclusive." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Louisiana Chemical Assn. feel differently. "The study was well 
done, well executed and generally regarded as a model epidemiological study," 
said Ed Flynn, health affairs coordinator with the association. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the larger refineries sponsored Earth Day activities earlier this 
year and have implemented school programs designed to highlight the positive 
benefits that result from a large chemical-based industry. 
</P>
<P>
"All we've tried to do is make people aware of the good we do," said Richard 
Kleiner, a spokesman for the chemical association. "Generally . . . most . . . 
companies here are environmentally aware . . . . From 1988 to 1989, we reduced 
our emissions by about 38%, and that trend will continue." 
</P>
<P>
In St. Gabriel, however, where the night sky is bright with lights shining from 
the always busy chemical plants, some residents still harbor doubts. "Most of 
the companies have done everything they can think of to divert attention away 
from the real issues," said Chris Gaudet. "And, by and large, they've been 
successful. A lot of people here worry about losing their jobs, they really 
don't want to talk about what these plants might be doing to their health."

BATTLE BREWS OVER PLAN TO USE ROAD FUNDS FOR MASS TRANSIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A five-syllable word being uttered by a new House committee chairman has 
truckers, road builders, auto clubs and other members of the highway lobby 
shuddering. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert A. Roe (D-N.J.) advocates giving states the "flexibility" to spend 
federal highway funds on mass transit systems. Although many urban areas would 
love to do so, they cannot under current law. 
</P>
<P>
But that law expires Sept. 30. And Roe, who just became chairman of the House 
Public Works and Transportation Committee, will have a big hand in writing the 
new one. 
</P>
<P>
The flexibility issue is but one of many that Congress will tackle when it 
takes up legislation to reauthorize funding of highway and mass transit 
programs through fiscal 1996. 
</P>
<P>
With a five-year price tag that could top $100 billion, the legislation will be 
one of the most costly items on Congress' agenda when it convenes Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND: Highway and mass transit interests have warred for years over 
divvying up federal gasoline tax revenues that flow into the Highway Trust 
Fund. Originally, the money was spent on road projects. But for more than a 
decade a fraction of the funds has been reserved for mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the gas tax was 9 cents per gallon; 8 of those pennies went for 
highways, 1 for public bus and rail systems. (Each cent per gallon generates 
about $1 billion.) 
</P>
<P>
The deficit reduction package passed by Congress earlier this year raised the 
gas tax by 5 cents per gallon. Half of that will go into the Highway Trust 
Fund. Highways will get 2 additional cents, mass transit another half of a 
penny. The balance will be used for deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is the trust fund growing, but also most of the huge sums that have 
been spent on interstate highways for the last 35 years can be applied now to 
other transportation projects, since only about 300 miles of the 42,800-mile 
interstate system remain to be built. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the trust fund now has a surplus of about $19 billion. As the fund 
grows, so have conflicts over how to spend it. With the development of 
interstates, suburbs have sprouted and sprawled, creating demands for new 
transportation networks. Many highways and bridges are in desperate need of 
repair, but new modes of public transportation are essential to cutting 
pollution and congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the last highway/mass transit measure, in 1987, set off a raucous 
veto fight with then-President Ronald Reagan. He assailed 120 "pork barrel" 
road projects listed in the bill as well as $667 million earmarked for the Los 
Angeles Metro Rail system. 
</P>
<P>
Congress overrode the veto, forcing the $88-billion measure into law. 
</P>
<P>
ISSUES: The debate on new legislation likely will center on the push by Roe and 
others for more mass transit money. 
</P>
<P>
"In urban centers, more highways alone are not the total answer. We're kidding 
ourselves if we don't move people with some flexibility," Roe said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Martin, a spokesman for the Highway Users Federation, said mass 
transit "already has plenty" of federal money, "especially in view of all the 
highway infrastructure needs that are not being met around the country." 
</P>
<P>
Closely related to this controversy will be President Bush's proposal to build 
new arterial roads dubbed "highways of national significance." Many would link 
interstates in areas of high population growth. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also is expected to spur controversy with plans to switch 
funding of some mass transit projects from the Highway Trust Fund to general 
revenues, which would force transit systems to compete for funds with 
non-transportation programs. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: A Bush veto is likely if Congress tries to spend more than the $14.5 
billion a year now going for highways and mass transit. Congress may attempt 
just that, especially in the event of a deep recession. Many lawmakers think 
creating public works jobs can spur economic recovery.

COLOMBIA DRUG CARTEL LEADER SURRENDERS; 
</P>
<P>
COCAINE: FABIO OCHOA CITES A GOVERNMENT PROMISE OF NO EXTRADITION.

A Medellin cartel leader wanted in the United States on murder and cocaine 
distribution charges turned himself in to Colombian authorities Tuesday as part 
of an unprecedented peace process between the government and cocaine bosses. 
</P>
<P>
Fabio Ochoa, 33, the youngest of three brothers who run the cartel together 
with Pablo Escobar, surrendered to authorities in a church just south of 
Medellin. Although four middle-level drug bosses have turned themselves in, 
Ochoa is the first of the cartel's top leaders to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa said he was surrendering under two government decrees offering drug 
traffickers lenient judicial treatment, including a promise of no extradition 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In order to receive the government benefits, Ochoa must confess to at least one 
crime, according to the government's decrees. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Jaime Giraldo Angel told reporters late Tuesday that he did 
not know what crime Ochoa had confessed. Although there were no indications 
Tuesday that the cartel's other leaders would follow Ochoa's lead, Giraldo said 
the government believes that they will. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa's public statement, which referred to his surrender as an "independent 
act," indicated that the other cartel leaders may ask for more government 
concessions before surrendering. Ochoa said that the two decrees offering 
lenient treatment are "a long way off from satisfying the expectations raised 
by the government." 
</P>
<P>
Fabio Ochoa and his brothers, Juan David and Jorge Luis, first expressed 
interest in turning themselves in after President Cesar Gaviria eased the 
government's inflexible crackdown on cocaine traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
In a Sept. 5 decree, Gaviria offered surrendering suspects guarantees that they 
would not be extradited and would receive reduced prison sentences if they 
confessed to their crimes and cooperated with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
After the cartel indicated interest but asked for more guarantees, Gaviria 
responded with a second decree, issued Monday, that guarantees no extradition 
for any trafficker confessing even one crime punishable by imprisonment. The 
decree also met two other cartel demands by designating a government delegate 
to protect traffickers' rights and by stipulating that the suspects would be 
placed in special jails. 
</P>
<P>
In their extradition request for Ochoa, U.S. authorities accuse him of 
distributing cocaine and ordering the 1986 assassination of Barry Seal, an 
informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his brothers, he is on the U.S. attorney general's list of the dozen 
most-wanted Colombian drug figures. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say Ochoa personally arranged the importation of tons of cartel 
cocaine into the United States when he managed the organization's Miami 
distribution network. 
</P>
<P>
He was indicted in Baton Rouge, La., in 1986 for taking part in a murder for 
hire, conspiracy to violate civil rights and obstruction of justice. In Miami, 
he faces 1986 charges of a racketeering conspiracy to manufacture and 
distribute cocaine. In Tampa, Fla., he was indicted last year for possession of 
cocaine with intent to distribute it, engaging in a criminal enterprise, 
interstate travel in aid of racketeering and use of force to influence others. 
</P>
<P>
The cartel is also accused of masterminding a terrorist campaign that killed 
hundreds of Colombians in 1989 and early 1990. In recent months, it has 
kidnaped 10 people. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa could be tried on charges other than the one to which he confesses, but 
he could receive a prison term of no more than 30 years, according to the 
government decrees.

POPE ASSAILS TOTALITARIANISM, INTOLERANCE; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: JOHN PAUL, IN WORLD DAY OF PEACE MESSAGE, ALSO CALLS FUNDAMENTALISM A 
THREAT TO PEACE.

Proclaiming freedom of conscience as mankind's "inalienable right," Pope John 
Paul II on Tuesday scored totalitarianism and intolerance and called religious 
fundamentalism a threat to world peace. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old pontiff returned to the theme of human rights for the third 
consecutive year in his message for the Roman Catholic Church's World Day of 
Peace on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Entitled "If You Want Peace, Respect the Conscience of Every Person," the 
6,000-word message urges world governments to respect the rights of minorities 
and to allow individuals to freely pursue their own beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"People must not attempt to impose their own 'truth' on others," the Pope said. 
"The right to profess the truth must always be upheld, but not in a way that 
involves contempt for those who may think differently. Truth imposes itself 
solely by the force of its own truth. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," John Paul noted, "we are still witnessing attempts to impose a 
particular idea on others, either directly -- by a proselytism which relies on 
means which are truly coercive -- or indirectly, by the denial of certain civil 
or political rights." 
</P>
<P>
Published Tuesday at the Vatican in Italian, French, English, Spanish, 
Portuguese, Polish and Arabic, the papal appeal will be distributed to 
governments around the world and read out in Catholic churches on New Year's 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
John Paul defended "the inalienable right to follow one's conscience and to 
profess and practice one's own faith," warning that those who violate such a 
fundamental human right risk causing "strained and hostile relations within 
society or even . . . open conflict." 
</P>
<P>
"A serious threat to peace is imposed by intolerance, which manifests itself in 
the denial of freedom of conscience to others. The excesses to which 
intolerance can lead us has been one of history's most painful lessons." 
</P>
<P>
Without naming them specifically, the Pope attacked governments and societies 
that ban religious practices -- a reference to totalitarian Marxist states -- 
and those that impose a single religion -- a reference to countries in which 
Muslim fundamentalism is the ruling force. 
</P>
<P>
When religious law becomes synonymous for civil law, the Pope warned, it "can 
stifle religious freedom, even going so far as to restrict or deny other 
inalienable human rights." 
</P>
<P>
"Intolerance can also result from the recurring temptation to fundamentalism, 
which easily leads to serious abuses, such as the radical suppression of all 
public manifestations of diversity, or even the outright denial of freedom of 
expression," John Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
Calling religion "a powerful force for liberation," he warned that attempts to 
suppress it risk "fueling open or latent rebellion." 
</P>
<P>
He insisted that individuals must have the right to choose their own religion. 
Citing excesses in the history of his own church, he asserted that "no one 
ought to be compelled to believe" and noted that "even today much remains to be 
done to overcome religious intolerance which in different parts of the world is 
connected with the oppression of minorities." 
</P>
<P>
Peace-threatening intolerance is born, John Paul said, when individuals or 
minorities "are oppressed or relegated to the margins of society. In public 
life, intolerance leaves no room for a plurality of political or social 
options, and thus imposes a monolithic vision of civil and cultural life."

Los Angeles executives playing Santa Claus sent a jet Tuesday to Saudi Arabia 
carrying gifts they thought U.S. troops need in the desert: designer 
sunglasses, expensive cologne, toy cars and moisturizer.

Troops watching the products being loaded onto trucks from a cargo plane seemed

<P>
"Operation Desert Cheer" was part of an effort by employees of MGM Grand Air, 
who figured executives willing to pay $1,200 to fly from Los Angeles to New 
York might donate some nifty gifts for American troops. 
</P>
<P>
A two-week gift drive netted 15 tons of goods.

In the most far-reaching gun control action ever taken in the United States, 
District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry announced Tuesday that he had signed a 
bill that makes manufacturers and sellers legally liable for deaths and 
injuries caused by the most fearsome assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need these guns on the street," the outgoing mayor said. The measure 
had been passed last week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the National Rifle Assn. accused the city government of "cheap 
theatrics" and predicted that the measure will not stand up in court.

Under a special review process that applies only to District of Columbia laws, 
Congress may veto the controversial gun control measure. Advocates and 
opponents both braced for a major fight on Capitol Hill when the new Congress 
convenes next month. 
</P>
<P>
"These weapons are so dangerous that the manufacturers and dealers have to know 
they are going to be used to kill people," said Michael Beard, president of the 
Coalition to Stop Handgun Violence. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Gardiner, NRA director of state and local affairs, retorted, "The whole 
concept of punishing the innocent manufacturer, who has no control over the 
sale of a gun, for the act of a criminal flies in the face of everything we've 
developed in the common law for six centuries." 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the bill said that, even if Congress disapproves the legislation and 
President Bush agrees to kill the measure, it still may serve as a model for 
other cities that are plagued by drug-related murders, such as Los Angeles, New 
York and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gardiner said that laws in 39 states prevent cities from passing any 
firearms legislation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, California enacted a law requiring owners of most assault weapons to 
register them or face fines and criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Although it already has one of the stiffest gun control laws on the books, 
Washington has the highest homicide rate in the nation, with a record 465 
murders so far this year. District of Columbia police say that nearly all of 
the guns used in crimes here were brought into the city from neighboring 
Maryland or Virginia, where gun laws are far less stringent. 
</P>
<P>
The new legislation would allow private citizens to file lawsuits for damages 
against the makers and sellers of fast-firing Street Sweepers, AK-47s, Uzis and 
similar assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Congress does not interfere frequently with the D.C. City Council's actions, 
but once measures become controversial they usually are turned down. 
</P>
<P>
Under the review procedure, opponents of the new gun law will have to move 
within 30 legislative days to get a resolution of disapproval through both the 
House and Senate and then get President Bush to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the law hope to bottle it up in the District of Columbia 
Committee, headed by Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), who is usually a 
strong proponent of home rule for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"From a legislative perspective, (supporters of the bill) have the advantage, 
and it's a significant advantage," said a spokesman for Sen. Dennis DeConcini 
(D-Ariz.). 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Dykema, chief adviser to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach), 
predicted that Congress will overturn the law. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Washington has far overstepped its bounds in trying to put gun 
(firms that) make assault weapons out of business," Dykema said. "I don't think 
Congress would let anybody get away with it -- even a state. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, a member of the House District of Columbia Committee, was 
traveling in the Middle East and could not be reached for comment.

ICC WILL BAN SMOKING ON MOST INTERSTATE BUS TRIPS 
</P>

<P>
In another defeat for the tobacco industry, the Interstate Commerce Commission 
voted unanimously Tuesday to ban smoking on all regularly scheduled interstate 
bus trips. 
</P>
<P>
The rule, which will take effect early next year after the ICC puts its 
decision into writing, applies to 300 bus companies which carry 94 million 
passengers a year. The nation's 1,700 companies providing charter and tour 
service may continue to allow each group that contracts for services to decide 
whether smoking should be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling came after the tobacco industry contended there are no proven health 
hazards for nonsmokers on interstate bus trips. 
</P>
<P>
However, anti-smoking groups pointed to a Department of Transportation study 
showing the adverse effects on nonsmokers from breathing tobacco smoke in 
airplane cabins. Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), a nonprofit consumer 
group, noted that smoking still will be permitted at bus stations along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"Smokers can refrain from smoking for several hours and light up at bus stops, 
but nonsmokers cannot similarly refrain from breathing," John Banzhaf, the 
executive director of ASH, told the ICC. 
</P>
<P>
The ICC began its rule-making process last March when two industry trade 
groups, the American Bus Assn. and the United Bus Owners of America, filed a 
joint petition asking the commission to ban smoking on interstate buses except 
those operated by charter companies. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, ASH petitioned the ICC to extend such a prohibition to charter 
buses as well. 
</P>
<P>
Citing evidence that smoking increases the threat of lung cancer and heart 
disease, both petitions noted that the U.S. surgeon general stressed in a 1986 
report that the health threat extends to nonsmokers who breathe second-hand 
smoke in a closed environment. 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound, the largest bus carrier, banned smoking on its own initiative last 
spring soon after the petitions were filed. Current ICC regulations provide 
that unless otherwise prohibited by state or local laws, bus operators may 
permit smoking in designated seats in the rear of a bus if they do not exceed 
10% of the total capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, in inviting more public comment on its intention to impose a 
smoking ban, the ICC said: "We believe that this proposal will have a 
beneficial impact on the public health of bus patrons and bus drivers." The 
commission said a variety of groups have since supported the ban. 
</P>
<P>
ASH, the anti-smoking group, said in its petition that the more limited seating 
capacity of buses forces nonsmoking passengers to sit closer to smokers than in 
planes and trains, and that ventilation on buses often is inferior to that of 
airplanes. It added that poor and elderly travelers, who are more likely to 
suffer from pre-existing health problems, also make up a large percentage of 
interstate bus travelers since buses are generally cheaper than trains and 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
Charter operators were exempted from the ban after expressing fear they would 
lose business if they were required to enforce a uniform nonsmoking ban.

COUNTY TO SELL RANCH SEIZED IN DRUG RAID

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite objections from Sheriff Brad Gates and his supporters, Orange County 
supervisors voted to sell a 213-acre ranch seized in a 1985 drug raid rather 
than turn it into a regional drug enforcement training center. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.4-million ranch in east Orange County has been an object of a long 
tug-of-war among county officials, who now have decided they cannot afford to 
keep it. The ranch became a prominent symbol of the county's war on drugs, and 
President Bush visited it in 1989 to highlight his national anti-drug campaign. 
The owner of the ranch, Daniel James Fowlie, has been accused of international 
drug smuggling.

DELAY ATTACK, GENERAL SAYS;

<TEXT>
<P>
One of President Bush's top military deputies in the Persian Gulf said today 
that U.S. troops will not be ready to mount an offensive by the Jan. 15 U.N. 
deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller, deputy commander of all U.S. forces in the gulf, 
voiced that assessment after a meeting with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Colin L. Powell and Gen. H. Norman 
Schwarzkopf, field commander of the American deployment. 
</P>
<P>
Waller told reporters that the full American deployment will reach about 
430,000 troops by mid-January but that late-arriving armored units would not be 
combat-ready for some time, perhaps not until a month past the Jan. 15 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he would respond if Bush wanted to order a strike on Iraqi forces 
before the full complement of American ground forces was ready, Waller said, 
"I'd tell him, 'No, I'm not ready to do the job.' " 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater was asked about 
Waller's remarks. "What he really said is they might not be as ready as they 
would like to be . . . for all the contingencies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are assured they will be ready to do whatever they are called upon to 
do," Fitzwater added. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and Powell told reporters traveling with them that the United States 
will be ready to go to war by the Jan. 15 deadline regardless of whether all 
reinforcements have arrived and reached combat-readiness. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney acknowledged that some ground forces on the way to Saudi Arabia from 
Kansas and Germany probably will not be combat-ready by mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
Waller said he does not anticipate Bush's ordering an attack immediately if 
Saddam Hussein ignores the U.N. deadline to withdraw his army from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my understanding that he's been briefed and received briefings that the 
forces will not be ready for combat activities until sometime after the 15th of 
the month," Waller said in a candid, 30-minute session with reporters traveling 
with Cheney and Powell on their first joint visit to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Waller was the first senior military officer to say publicly that he will 
oppose any U.S.-led military strike until the full force is in place. His 
comments raised eyebrows among deputies to Schwarzkopf and Powell, who said 
they were concerned that Waller had been too candid. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say to the President and to the secretary and to the chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff that until our full complement of forces are on the 
ground that we should not initiate hostile activities," Waller said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two senators just back in Washington from visiting the gulf said 
they believe, based on talks with U.S. military commanders, that the United 
States could conclude a war with Iraq very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that with the strategic power we have, particularly in the air and 
on the sea, that we should be able to complete the mission in a very short 
time," Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) told reporters after meeting with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if there is a war, it will be a short one that will last no more than 
five days," said Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii).

The Commerce Department said the gross national product grew from July to

THE WRONG BONG IMPERILS BIG BEN TRADITION

Big Ben's chimes, which traditionally announce the queen's Christmas Day 
message and ring in the New Year, might not make it onto BBC airwaves this time 
around. Seems the main bell has lost its distinctive bong. 
</P>
<P>
A decision has yet to be made, and some British Broadcasting Corp. officials 
believe that it would be a big mistake to depart from tradition by banning the 
bong this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
The chimes have traditionally been used on BBC airwaves as a lead-in to news 
bulletins, but disappeared temporarily in March after cracks were found in the 
hammer arm of the 132-year-old main bell -- Big Ben -- that sounds the hours. 
</P>
<P>
The original Victorian hammer was removed and replaced with a new, $15,000 
steel hammer. 
</P>
<P>
But ever since the 13-ton bell went back into service in August, BBC executives 
have been unenthusiastic, so much so that they have begun phasing the chimes 
out of regular broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
"It just sounds wrong," said Simon Schute, the BBC's general manager of 
operations and engineering, responsible for setting up microphones in the Big 
Ben belfry, 334 steps above the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no expert on bells, but this one has a sort of curious start and finishes 
sounding sort of small and clattery. It certainly doesn't sound rich and 
important anymore," Schute said. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Independent Television News has solved the problem by continuing to 
use a 1967 recording of Big Ben. But BBC executives won't hear of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We shall either use the real thing or nothing at all," said John Breach, 
presentation organizer of Radio 4, the BBC's flagship domestic channel. 
</P>
<P>
Breach said listeners understood the reason for the change, but BBC executives 
fear that the public may not be so patient with a change in a holiday tradition 
that dates back to midnight, Dec. 31, 1923. 
</P>
<P>
Every year since then, the live sounds from Big Ben have rung in the New Year 
and introduced the monarch's speech on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still trying to decide what to do," Breach said.

Sadako Ogata, 65, a Japanese professor of foreign relations with experience in 
the U.N. Children's Fund, has been nominated as U.N. high commissioner for 
refugees, diplomatic sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
She would replace Thorvald Stoltenberg, who recently resigned to become deputy 
prime minister of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
The reported move could end a long and controversial search for the next 
refugee chief. Several developed nations, including the United States, have 
been at odds with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar over the 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
She would be the first woman to hold the post, which traditionally has been 
held by Westerners, including many high-profile politicians and fund-raisers.

Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a veteran of Lebanon's turbulent politics, resigned 
today to make way for a broad-based government that will try to end 15 1/2 
years of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
But Christian and Muslim militia chieftains voiced dissent that could undermine 
peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Hoss, a Sunni Muslim who formed his government last Nov. 25, presented the 
resignation of his 14-member Cabinet to President Elias Hrawi, a Maronite 
Catholic. Hrawi asked Hoss to stay on as caretaker prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
The new Cabinet will be charged with drafting a plan to disband the private 
armies that have fought Lebanon's civil war since 1975. It is expected to 
include members from the main warring militias as well as political parties. 
</P>
<P>
However, the two strongest militias -- Christian chieftain Samir Geagea's 
Lebanese Forces and Druze warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party 
-- expressed doubts about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the president is dealing with the question of a new government 
indicates he might bring in an untidy government that would stumble upon its 
first steps," Jumblatt's party said. "This could create a dangerous power 
vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
Jumblatt, a member of the outgoing Cabinet, has publicly accused Hrawi of 
corruption and favortism. Hrawi's aides countered by charging Jumblatt with 
"corrupt deeds" in his Ministry of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Forces militia said in a statement that Geagea "will not take part 
in the new Cabinet.

America's tolerance for the hungry and homeless is declining as a growing needy 
population outstrips cities' ability to help, the United States Conference of 
Mayors said today. 
</P>
<P>
Its annual report of hunger and homelessness in 30 cities concluded that many 
people, irritated by panhandlers and despairing of a solution to what appears 
to be an intractable problem, are losing patience with the needs of the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"We as an American public don't reach out to help one another like we used to," 
Charlotte, N.C., Mayor Sue Myrick, co-chairwoman of the conference's Task Force 
on Hunger and Homelessness, said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't share like we used to. We've become a very selfish nation." 
</P>
<P>
Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, co-chairman of the task force, said volunteerism 
is frustrated by the government's failure to deal with the increasing number of 
mentally ill on the streets and to provide adequate low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Volunteers are not going to be able to solve the problems of urban America. 
They cannot provide the medical care for mentally ill people. Volunteers cannot 
deal with the growing problem of infant mortality in our country. They can't 
educate our troubled kids," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the 30 cities polled said public attitudes toward the needy had 
turned negative or were mixed. Nine cities have already taken such actions as 
keeping panhandlers out of subway stations in New York and prohibiting 
loitering in public places in Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
"The NIMBY (not in my back yard) attitude is prevalent," officials in Phoenix 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
"A severe anti-homeless backlash has increased dramatically in the past year" 
due to violence, aggressive panhandling and misuse of parks involving the 
homeless, said officials from Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the cities surveyed said expanding programs to feed and shelter 
those in need fell short of the growing demand. Cities saw little hope for 
relief as the nation slid into recession, meaning more jobless and homeless and 
dwindling public funds to help them. 
</P>
<P>
Requests for food aid were up 22% in 1990, while demand for emergency shelter 
increased by 24%, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, emergency food resources were up 4%, and available shelter beds 
increased by 3%.

U.S. ALLEGES MOB CONTROLS CASINO UNION;

CRIME: THE BRUNO-SCARFO FAMILY HAS USED KILLING AND EXTORTION TO CONTROL THE

<P>
A union representing Atlantic City casino workers is controlled through mob 
killing, extortion, embezzlement and bribery, the Justice Department said in 
court papers filed today. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said at a morning news conference that the 
local has been controlled for 20 years by the Bruno-Scarfo organized-crime 
family, which controls Philadelphia and southern New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"Through their brutal and often deadly acts of violence and intimidation, 
members of the Bruno-Scarfo families have destroyed the integrity of the union 
and its leadership," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicodemo (Little Nicky) Scarfo has been controlling the local from prison, 
where he is serving a life sentence for his 1988 conviction on Racketeer 
Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act charges, according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, the Justice Department is seeking to 
take control under civil racketeering statutes of the 22,000-member Local 54 of 
the Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees International Union. The local 
represents hotel, bar and restaurant workers in Atlantic City casinos and in 
other southern New Jersey cities. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks court-ordered control of the local, the restriction of the 
union's international president from the local's affairs, the removal of the 
local's president and five other officials and the forfeiture of illegally 
obtained profits. 
</P>
<P>
Also named was Edward Hanley, president of the Washington-based international 
since 1973. The suit said he was an associate of senior members of the 
Chicago-based organized-crime family. 
</P>
<P>
Citing alleged dealings with organized-crime figures in New Jersey, New York 
and Las Vegas, prosecutors are seeking to bar Hanley from further association 
with Local 54. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh said the organized-crime families earned perhaps hundreds of 
thousands of dollars through sweetheart contracts and kickbacks.

All Nippon Airways, Japan's second biggest airline, said today that it will 
order 25 Boeing-777 airliners from the United States and 10 European Airbus 
A-340s, a total package worth $5.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
An ANA official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said contracts will be 
signed early next year with Boeing Co. for 15 firm orders and 10 options for 
delivery between 1995 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
He said the planes, with 411 seats each, will be used on domestic routes. 
</P>
<P>
The official said ANA also will sign contracts early next year with Airbus 
consortium for five firm orders and five options for delivery between 1996 and 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
The A-340 planes, with 236 seats, will be used on international routes, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The official said both types of planes will cost about $150 million each, and 
replacement engines and other related equipment could bring the value of the 
total package to about $5.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
ANA now has a fleet of 105 aircraft, including 44 Boeing 767s.

Overall U.S. oil demand dropped 2.6% in November from year-ago levels in face 
of higher fuel prices and the slowing economy, the American Petroleum Institute 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is the world's largest oil-consuming nation and the No. 2 oil 
producer after the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for most major petroleum products, such as gasoline and home-heating 
oil, declined in November, the oil industry trade group said in its monthly 
report, but deliveries of kerosene jet fuel reached record levels for this time 
of year. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic crude production slipped 6% in November from a year ago, partly 
reflecting an ouptut slowdown from Alaska's North Slope caused by stormy 
weather at the Port of Valdez.

European luxury cars are selling fast as buyers hurry to avoid new taxes that 
take effect New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
A surge in late November and early December sales was reported by a dealers 
association and sales managers. 
</P>
<P>
"All companies are reporting an increase in sales," said Bob Howe, who follows 
European luxury cars for the National Automobile Dealers Assn. in McLean, Va. 
"In many cases their business has doubled from what it was a year ago. They are 
very mindful of the fact that there will be a fall in business in January." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 1, consumers paying more than $30,000 for a new car will be assessed a 
10% tax on the amount over $30,000, and the gas guzzler tax on the least 
fuel-efficient vehicles will double. 
</P>
<P>
The new taxes could add thousands of dollars to a flashy car's price. 
</P>
<P>
At Estate Motors Ltd. in Birmingham, Mich., sales manager David Trudeau said 
Mercedes sales in early December jumped about 30% from the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year, sales of expensive European imported cars, including 
Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche, had been running behind last year's pace.

One of the pillars of tennis is getting rid of the pillars on the world's most 
famous court. 
</P>
<P>
The 26 pillars that hold up the roof of Centre Court at Wimbledon will be 
removed after next summer's tournament, providing unobstructed views for an 
additional 3,600 fans. 
</P>
<P>
A new roof will be installed as well. 
</P>
<P>
The All-England Lawn Tennis Club, where the grass-court Grand Slam is held, 
said the old pillars were remnants of the original Centre Court design, from 
1922. Their place will be taken by four new supports, only two of which will be 
in the seating area; this will leave only 1% of the court's 13,107 seats with 
obstructed views. 
</P>
<P>
Club officials refused to reveal the cost of the work, which is due to begin as 
soon as the 1991 tournament is over.

BOXING PROMOTERS AND TIME WARNER FORGE PAY-TV DEAL

Time Warner Sports joined forces today with boxing promoters Bob Arum and Dan 
Duva to form a pay-per-view network, TVKO, that will begin monthly shows on 
April 19 with the Evander Holyfield-George Foreman heavyweight title bout. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, finalized on Tuesday, gives TVKO exclusive rights to any pay-per-view 
telecasts involving promotions by either Arum's Top Rank Inc. or Duva's Main 
Events. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, however, does not preclude TVKO from also showing fights of other 
promoters. 
</P>
<P>
"This hasn't been the easiest thing to put together," Arum said, "but we're 
here today. This is historical in that it aligns a sport that's been much 
maligned with one of the biggest, most powerful companies in the world. It's 
taken boxing out of the sweaty, smoke-filled back rooms and given it instant 
respectability." 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the agreement, neither Arum nor Duva will have any equity in 
TVKO. They will share in any profits and will put up collateral from those 
profits to help defray any losses. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner Sports President Seth Abraham said TVKO plans a monthly show, with 
two fights per show, as well as certain "mega-fights," such as Holyfield's 
defense of his undisputed heavyweight title against Foreman. The cost to 
pay-per-view subscribers for the regular monthly shows will be under $20. The 
Holyfield-Foreman fight will cost $35 and up, Duva said. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner Sports was formed last summer by Time Warner Inc., the parent 
company of HBO. HBO's contract with Don King for the rights to Mike Tyson 
fights ended with Tyson's victory over Alex Stewart on Dec. 8 in Atlantic City. 
After the fight, King made a deal with HBO competitor Showtime.

First, the SuperSonics had to make it to the arena through a blizzard. After 
that, plowing through the Orlando Magic was almost easy. 
</P>
<P>
A freak storm dumped snowfall ranging from 8 inches downtown to 14 inches in 
some suburbs Tuesday evening. Winds gusted to 60 m.p.h. on Puget Sound, tens of 
thousands of homes were without power and children were stranded overnight in 
more than three dozen schools. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, only 1,568 spectators made it to the Seattle Coliseum -- there 
were 10,475 tickets sold -- to watch the Sonics beat the Magic, 122-105, 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Several Sonics talked about their nightmarish journey to the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me about 45 minutes to go three blocks," Sonic center Michael Cage 
said. "I just parked my car and walked the rest of the way. I wondered if the 
game would be canceled." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle gets lots of rain but little snow and has practically no snow removal 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle Coach K. C. Jones and guard Dale Ellis were late arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
Jones arrived in the middle of the second quarter. The trip from his Issaquah 
home took four hours instead of the usual 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis didn't arrive until the end of the third period. He played three minutes 
in the fourth quarter and made both his shots. 
</P>
<P>
At least the Sonics could take comfort in the victory. Orlando's players 
traveled about 3,000 miles and encountered a winter nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to be a long night when we left the hotel and on the way 
here, the bus got stuck," Magic forward Jerry Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so cold in here. We did not handle the ball well and we did not get 
warmed up until the second quarter," Reynolds said.

A school board has fired two high football school coaches accused of holding a

ceiling by his hands unless he improved his grades enough to play football next 
year.

The coaches had been suspended after Thea Clark, the mother of 14-year-old

football next year.

Maxey testified that Spacek tried to tie his hands with an extension cord and 
threatened to hang him from the ceiling and that Ramsey then went to his truck 
to get a starter's pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey held him in a hammerlock and pointed the pistol at his temple, but 
Spacek told him not to fire the gun, the boy said. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3 1/2-hour board hearing requested by the coaches, Spacek and Ramsey 
denied they had ever threatened Maxey with a cord or pistol, as the boy and 
five witnesses had said. 
</P>
<P>
Superintendent Alvin Davis, who recommended the firings, said the two coaches 
never denied the allegations when he questioned them the day of and the day 
after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Huntsville lawyers Hal Ridley and Robert DeLong, who represent Spacek and 
Ramsey, said they will file lawsuits alleging their clients were wrongfully 
dismissed. Spacek had just completed his second year of coaching the Bulldogs; 
Ramsey was in his first year. 
</P>
<P>
The Walker County sheriff's office is investigating the incident.

SPORTSMAN OF THE YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: JOE MONTANA BECOMES THE FIRST NFL PLAYER TO WIN THE SPORTS 
ILLUSTRATED HONOR BY HIMSELF.

On a day Joe Montana made it abundantly clear he's against taking a rest in the 
final two games of the regular season, he received what he perceives as his 
greatest individual honor. 
</P>
<P>
In accepting Sports Illustrated's award as Sportsman of the Year on Tuesday, 
Montana becomes the first NFL player to win the honor alone. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw and Pittsburgh Pirates slugger 
Willie Stargell were co-winners in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the honors he's won, including being named the NFL's Most Valuable 
Player last season, Montana said the magazine's award means more "because 
you're not just competing with your peers . . . it goes outside those 
boundaries (of football)." 
</P>
<P>
When asked who among the previous winners he most admired or identified with 
most, Montana chose 1989 winner Greg LeMond because "anybody who has pedaled a 
bicycle knows how hard it is . . . to do it back to back. (Winning the Tour de 
France) is a great accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
At 34, Montana says he has no intention of calling it quits, adding that his 
physical condition is better now than it was at this point last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd still like to finish my contract," he said, which would take him at least 
through 1993. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, he has no desire for his body to be idle in the last two 
regular-season games, even though the 49ers have already clinched the best 
record in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Being rested, maybe there's good to it," Montana said. "On the other hand, 
with too much rest you'd probably go in the other direction (i.e. stale)."

ASTROS SAVING $3 MILLION BUT LOSING TALENT; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HOUSTON'S FOUR ON-FIELD LOSSES ARE LEAVING GAPS THAT WILL BE HARD TO 
FILL.

Saving money is costing the Houston Astros talent. 
</P>
<P>
In less than two weeks, the Astros have lost two of their top relievers, 
all-time save leader Dave Smith and Juan Agosto. They've also said goodby to 
Franklin Stubbs, their top RBI producer of 1990, and reserve outfielder Terry 
Puhl. 
</P>
<P>
Deducting the four players' combined 1990 salaries saved the Astros $3.2 
million, but the on-field losses left holes that will be hard to fill. 
</P>
<P>
Owner John McMullen is trying to sell the team and has installed a tight 
financial rein while their NL West rivals, especially San Francisco and the 
Dodgers, have opened their wallets for trades and free-agent signings. 
</P>
<P>
The revolving door away from the rebuilding Astros spun a little faster today 
when free-agent pitcher Danny Darwin signed a four-year contract with the 
Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a players' market right now, and we're sticking with our philosophy," 
General Manager Bill Wood said after Smith signed a two-year, $4.9-million deal 
with the Chicago Cubs on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Darwin became new-look free agents as the result of the collusion 
settlement between owners and the players' union. Houston's tight-money 
policies also could lead to problems in signing first baseman Glenn Davis, who 
can become a free agent after the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's rebuilding project -- the Astros finished fourth in the NL West with 
a 75-87 record -- started before the season ended. The Astros dealt veteran 
reliever Larry Andersen to Boston and sent longtime second baseman Bill Doran 
to Cincinnati at the trading deadline, receiving minor-league prospects in both 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was 6-6 with 23 saves last season and leads all active pitchers with a 
2.53 ERA. He has 199 career saves, fourth among active pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 36, said he left the Astros, for whom he had played his entire 
big-league career, because he wants to play for a contender. 
</P>
<P>
"If I thought they had a chance to contend, I would have signed with them for a 
lot less money," Smith said. "But I don't see that team contending for the next 
two or three years. . . . I understand that's what you have to do when you 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
"It just wasn't a situation I was prepared to go through for the next two or 
three years."

SALE OF MCCARTNEY BIRTH CERTIFICATE IS INVESTIGATED

State and local officials confirmed they are investigating whether the $18,000 
auction sale of ex-Beatle Paul McCartney's birth certificate was faked to 
inflate the document's value. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state Licensing and Regulation Department and the Harris 
County district attorney's office said Tuesday that the allegations made by the 
auction's promoter, Cheryl Bean, could lead to charges of deceptive business 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
The birth certificate -- the legitimacy of which has not been questioned -- was 
put up for sale last month by Marshall Terrell, who bought it from McCartney's 
stepmother, Angela Williams, according to a bill of sale provided by Bean. 
McCartney was not involved in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Bean accused Terrell, buyer Brian Taylor, auctioneer Ray Simpson and Phoebe 
Moody, who took the certificate to Simpson on Terrell's behalf, of faking the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
"Now when Marshall and them want to sell it, they can say, 'Well, gee, it sold 
for $18,000 in Houston,' and get a lot more for it later," she said.

$100-MILLION MARK PASSED BY 'HOME ALONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The smash hit film "Home Alone" has passed the $100-million mark, hitting that 
benchmark faster than any other film this year, Twentieth Century-Fox said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Home Alone," which has led the nation's box office for five consecutive 
weekends, pulled in $100.2 million in ticket sales in the 32 days since its 
release. 
</P>
<P>
New Line Cinema's "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" had previously been the 
fastest film to hit the $100-million barrier, needing 36 days. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's "Ghost," the year's top grosser with $201.2 million, crossed the 
mark in 39 days, while Disney's "Pretty Woman" hit that level in 52 days. 
</P>
<P>
"Home Alone," starring Macaulay Culkin as an 8-year-old boy accidentally left 
home while his family leaves for vacation, is one of just half a dozen other 
movies in the last decade that have grossed more than $10 million per weekend 
at the box-office during five separate weekends: "E.T.," "Return of the Jedi," 
"Ghostbusters," "Beverly Hills Cop," "Batman" and "Look Who's Talking."

Actor Charlton Heston predicts that epic films like "Ben Hur" and "Lawrence of 
Arabia" will soon be as obsolete as silent movies. 
</P>
<P>
"The movie, 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' cost more than 'Ben Hur,' (in 1959 
dollars) so that means they don't make movies like that," Heston said in an 
interview this week on the syndicated television show "Personalities." 
</P>
<P>
"They will never make a 'Lawrence of Arabia' again. They will never make 
'Bridge on the River Kwai' again, which is too bad," Heston said. "But we got 
to make those movies, and I'm glad we did. 
</P>
<P>
"People make fewer films now," Heston said. 
</P>
<P>
Heston, 67, also decried the high price of a movie ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I just found out -- because I get into a lot of movies for free -- 
that they're charging $7 to go to a movie in Los Angeles now. Now, that's 
terrible."

Singer Julio Iglesias says he knows his limitations and that means his world is 
on a sound stage, not a movie set. 
</P>
<P>
Iglesias said he decided not to pursue an acting career because "I am the worst 
actor on earth," the singer confessed in an interview to be shown on "The Joan 
Rivers Show." 
</P>
<P>
"I did a film 20 years ago, and when I saw the film again, I felt guilty and 
embarrassed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to sing," Iglesias told Rivers, but "I don't need to spend two hours 
singing in a movie." 
</P>
<P>
Iglesias admits that he would "love to do that. It's such a nice situation to 
be an actor," but he also says, "I can't make it."
