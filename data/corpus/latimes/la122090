LATINO OFFICEHOLDERS INCREASE BY 6% ACROSS U.S. IN YEAR -- TO 4,004 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The number of Latinos holding elected offices across the nation increased by 
nearly 6% during the last year, a trend that is likely to accelerate after new 
congressional and state legislative districts are drawn in 1991, politicians, 
political observers and voting rights activists said. 
</P>
<P>
There are 4,004 Latinos holding office in the 50 states, ranging from seats on 
school boards to the U.S. Congress, according to a recent survey by the 
National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. Last year, 3,783 
Latinos held office. 
</P>
<P>
NALEO's president, Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles), said the gains are 
smaller than hoped for, but still encouraging. "I was hoping it would be more 
than 6%," Roybal said. "But it shows a definite increase in Latino 
representation." 
</P>
<P>
Latinos still account for less than 1% of the nation's elected officials while 
they make up about 8% of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
The 6% growth continues the trend that has seen the number of Latino elected 
officials rise from 3,128 in 1984, the first year the Los Angeles-based 
association published a survey. 
</P>
<P>
The national total includes gains made by some predominantly Latino communities 
that have struggled for better political representation for years. For example, 
Raul Perez and Luis Hernandez last April became the first Latinos elected to 
the Huntington Park City Council. Perez had previously run five times in 
Huntington Park, where the population is about 90% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of Latino elected officials are school board members, a low 
rung on the political ladder. Ten Latinos are members of the U.S. House of 
Representatives; 128 hold seats in state legislatures, 368 are county 
supervisors and 1,212 are city council members. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's only Latino governor, Republican Bob Martinez of Florida, was 
defeated on Nov. 6 in his reelection bid. NALEO's national director, Harry 
Pachon, said the sting of that loss was lessened somewhat by the election of 
Texas Rep. Dan Morales to be that state's attorney general. He is the first 
Latino in that post. 
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the 6% increase to more Latinos registering to vote as the 
population has increased and a greater political sophistication of the Latino 
community. That sophistication has resulted in voting rights lawsuits and court 
decisions that have given Latino candidates a better chance to win office. 
</P>
<P>
The next sizable jump could come in several years, after state and national 
electoral districts are redrawn in 1991, the experts said. The redistricting 
will reflect population changes marked by the decennial U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos hold just three of California's 45 congressional seats, even though 
they account for about one-fourth of the state's population. California is 
expected to pick up seven new seats through reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how you could escape not having at least one more congressional 
seat" that could be won by a Latino candidate in California, said political 
scientist Larry Berg, who heads the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at 
USC. Redistricting is "going to be a very competitive process" and that blacks 
and Asians also will be pushing for greater representation, Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of two Latino voting rights organizations said they will be watching 
the redistricting carefully to ensure that the voting strength of Latinos is 
not diluted through gerrymandering, as both Democrats and Republicans try to 
protect their seats. 
</P>
<P>
"We, the community, will challenge (with lawsuits) redistricting plans that we 
do not feel protect our interests," said Antonia Hernandez, president and 
general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "In 
the past, they've been able to gerrymander a community and get away with it 
because the community didn't have the resources and the sophistication." 
</P>
<P>
Court decisions of the last decade will weigh on state legislatures as they 
work on reapportionment next year, the experts said. A federal judge recently 
ruled that Los Angeles County supervisors discriminated against Latinos in 1981 
by drawing district lines that gave Latino candidates little chance of being 
elected to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the redrawn districts should be more favorable to Latino candidates, 
said Richard Martinez, executive director of the Southwest Voter Registration 
Education Project. "The legislatures are very mindful of being challenged," 
Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Texas has the most Latino officeholders with 1,889, according to NALEO, 
followed by New Mexico with 692, California with 596, Arizona with 271 and 
Colorado at 192. 
</P>
<P>
Pachon said more Latino politicians have been successful in Texas because the 
Latino population is heavily concentrated in the southern part of the state. In 
addition, Texas is where MALDEF and the Southwest Voter Registration cut their 
teeth, challenging at-large elections and launching voter registration drives 
in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Latino activists say that at-large elections -- in which candidates do not run 
from districts -- as well as gerrymandering, have diluted the political power 
of Latino communities. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico has a well-established Latino population that has long been active 
in state politics, Pachon said. In addition, the New Mexico Legislature, bowing 
to pressure from Southwest Voter Registration and other groups in 1985, 
outlawed at-large elections in cities of more than 10,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
California, the state with the largest Latino population, has lagged. 
</P>
<P>
"California is still woefully unrepresentative of the Hispanic population," 
said Hal Dash, president of the Los Angeles political consulting firm of 
Cerrell Associates Inc. "There's still some catching up to do. Hispanic 
representation should and must increase." 
</P>
<P>
Only recently have MALDEF and Southwest Voter Registration really pushed in the 
state, filing lawsuits and staging voter registration drives. Hernandez said 
California is now the top priority for MALDEF, which was one of the parties 
that sued Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
NALEO, Southwest Voter Registration and other Latino activists also have been 
staging voter registration and citizenship drives in California and other key 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Citizenship has been one major stumbling block that has prevented Latinos from 
making more political gains, Pachon said. Only 63.7% of the 12.9 million 
Latinos of voting age were citizens and eligible to cast ballots in the 1988 
general election, according to NALEO statistics derived from the census. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the citizenship drives, some gains should result from the 
Amnesty Program established under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 
1986. An estimated 3.1 million people are at varying stages on their way to 
citizenship and voting rights as a result of that law. Most of those applicants 
could become U.S. citizens by 1997. The first impact of citizenship and 
registration gains should be felt in local elections, Pachon said. 
</P>
<P>
At the state level, Latinos already are a force to be reckoned with in Texas 
and New Mexico, the experts said. That is becoming the case in California, 
Florida and Arizona, they added. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to show up on the radar screen," Pachon said. "We're not 
talking just potential, as much as we're talking an emerging reality."

AFIELD: SNOW WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
WITH SPONTANEITY, YOU TOO CAN BE CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

books on hiking and cycling in San Diego County.

<P>
Powdery snow was softly crunching beneath my skinny skis as I kicked and glided 
across West Mesa in the Cuyamaca Mountains. In the blue-shadowed gloom of the 
oak forest, a doe bounded across my path. She was the first of about two dozen 
deer I would spot that January morning on my circle tour of Cuyamaca Peak. Only 
an hour's drive from my home on the balmy coastal plain, I was enjoying a 
winter sport -- cross-country skiing -- in a region that hardly recognizes 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County's mountains aren't high enough to retain snow from a big storm 
for very long. But even if the current rainy season turns out to be as dry as 
the last several, the next few weeks should still bring at least one cold front 
capable of blanketing the higher elevations, albeit briefly, with a foot or 
more of white powder. 
</P>
<P>
Spontaneity is the key to exploiting these rare opportunities. Follow the 
weather forecast closely (reports may be heard 24 hours a day by dialing 
289-1212). If stormy weather is about to turn to clearing skies the following 
day, then it's time to dust off your cross-country skis or snowshoes, and 
gather together some warm clothing for an outing the next day. (You may be able 
to rent cross-country ski gear -- several ski and outdoor shops in the county 
provide this service.) Don't forget tire chains; they may be required at the 
higher elevations. 
</P>
<P>
Plan to rise early and make haste so you can beat the multitudes of "snow 
bunnies" that will surely (on a weekend at least) clog the mountain roads by 
late morning. 
</P>
<P>
Spur-of-the -moment strategies aren't necessary if you don't mind traveling 2 
1/2 hours or longer to reach the ski slopes north and east of Los Angeles, or 
farther afield in the Sierra Nevada. There's a certain satisfaction, however, 
in looking down upon your own home town, and the blue Pacific beyond, from the 
white-mantled heights of our back-yard mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Here are San Diego County's best areas for cross-country skiing or, for that 
matter, any kind of snow play: 
</P>
<P>
LAGUNA MOUNTAIN RECREATION AREA 
</P>
<P>
Three-mile-long Laguna Meadow, in the heart of the recreation area, is San 
Diego County's biggest single playground for cross-country skiing. With flat to 
gently sloping terrain averaging about 5,500 feet in elevation, the area is 
perfect for experts, beginners and youngsters alike. 
</P>
<P>
Park at the Meadows Information Station (near the 19.0-mile-marker on Sunrise 
Highway) and go north to reach the south arm of the meadow. You may also begin 
from points farther along Sunrise Highway (County S1), such as Laguna 
Campground. Outside the meadow area, a multitude of dirt roads beckon the 
intrepid traveler. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, call the Descanso Ranger District of the Cleveland 
National Forest, 445-8341. 
</P>
<P>
CUYAMACA RANCHO STATE PARK 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 miles of trails and fire roads wind through this 25,000-acre 
park, most of which is at elevations between 4,000 and 6,000 feet. Because of 
their steepness, many of these routes are quite challenging for the average 
cross-country skier. You can park in any of several turnouts along California 
79, and ski up toward higher ground to the east or west. Relatively flat areas 
can be found right off the road in the Stonewall Mine area at the north end of 
the park, and near the Sweetwater River bridge near the park's south end. 
</P>
<P>
Expert skiers with the proper equipment, map and navigational skills can try to 
reach Cuyamaca Peak, the county's second-highest point. The perilously steep 
and direct Cuyamaca Peak Fire Road can be avoided for the most part by choosing 
more gradual but longer approaches, such as the route up the West Mesa and 
Burnt Pine fire roads. 
</P>
<P>
For park information, call 765-0755. 
</P>
<P>
PALOMAR MOUNTAIN 
</P>
<P>
Unplowed roads in Palomar Mountain State Park and through Fry Creek Campground 
(2 miles below the observatory) may be ski-able, but be sure to stay off 
private roads and property adjoining these areas. 
</P>
<P>
Elevations average about 5,000 feet. For park information, call 742-3462. 
</P>
<P>
LOS COYOTES INDIAN RESERVATION 
</P>
<P>
This 25,000-acre reservation, 5 miles east of Warner Springs, includes the 
county's highest peak -- 6,533-foot Hot Springs Mountain. Most of the 
reservation is open for camping and day use, but call first (782-3269) if 
you'll be arriving on a weekday. 
</P>
<P>
From a point just beyond the entrance booth, a dirt road winds steadily uphill 
to Hot Springs Mountain's summit, gaining 2,700 feet. For an ascent on skis, 
timing is critical as snow melts quickly on the road's lower, sun-exposed end.

UCLA EXTENSION IS SEEKING OUT LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to changing demographics in the Los Angeles area, UCLA Extension, 
which is supported entirely by student enrollment fees, is in the midst of a 
campaign to attract more Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos make up about one-third of Los Angeles County's population, but they 
make up only about 3% of the more than 100,000 students who enroll annually in 
the wide variety of courses designed for both professional and personal 
enrichment, according to officials for the continuing education arm of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first steps taken by UCLA Extension to increase Latino enrollment 
was to hire Patricia Mendoza, a former special assistant in the UCLA Office of 
Student Affairs, to head its Latino outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
Next, it broadened its minority community outreach scholarship program -- 
Scholarships to Encourage Extension Diversity (SEED) -- to include Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
It is also offering more Latino-themed classes, such as the recent eight-week 
course, "Chicano Culture in America," and a two-session class that examined the 
exhibition "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965 to 1985." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at what we are offering for the Latino population in terms of 
career advancement and just plain interests," said Mendoza, who earned her 
doctorate in psychology from the University of Texas at Austin. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza said the campus' Westside location and poor promotion of UCLA Extension 
are believed by officials to be the primary reasons for low Latino enrollment 
in the courses, which cost from $75 to $900 each. "We want the Latino community 
to know that, although we are not located in an area that is traditionally 
Latino, we are sensitive to Latino concerns," she said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA extension offers more than 70 certificate programs, such as journalism, 
film, municipal solid waste management, recording arts and sciences, real 
estate and accounting. Students who complete the required academic work receive 
a certificate with the seal of the University of California. College credit 
toward degrees also can be earned with some of the classes. 
</P>
<P>
A high school diploma is not required to enroll. However, students should have 
the ability to handle college-level courses and a strong knowledge of English. 
Very few courses are taught in Spanish. A variety of courses in English as a 
second language are offered. 
</P>
<P>
Yolande Adelson, an associate dean who is overseeing the SEED scholarships, 
said the program started last spring with black students. This fall it was 
extended to both Latinos and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Community groups or companies identify applicants for the program. UCLA 
Extension selects the winners and pays the equivalent of 90% of their tuition 
costs, up to $270 per course. The community group pays the remaining 10%. The 
scholarship recipients must be legal residents and enroll in a certificate 
program. 
</P>
<P>
TELACU (The East Los Angeles Community Union), a community development 
corporation, was one of the first Latino groups to participate in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is a great opportunity for our employees to better themselves," 
said Marci Ramirez, TELACU's manager of corporate communications. "It's very 
refreshing to see UCLA say it is willing to subsidize the costs." 
</P>
<P>
Emilio Rodriguez, an assistant scholarship coordinator at TELACU and a student 
sponsored by his employer, said he welcomes the financial assistance to further 
his education. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to go to graduate school, and I see this as a transition," said 
Rodriguez, who is taking classes in urban planning. "Even before SEED, I was 
looking to go to UCLA for graduate work." 
</P>
<P>
Both Ramirez and Rodriguez said the distance for many Latinos living in the 
Eastside is a small sacrifice. "The opportunity is so great that you look at 
the transportation situation and people just set that apart," Ramirez said. "I 
don't think people will hesitate just because of the commute." 
</P>
<P>
Although some classes are offered downtown at 1100 S. Grand Ave., Mendoza said 
the challenge will be to attract more people to the Westwood campus because the 
bulk of the classes in certified programs are offered there. 
</P>
<P>
She hopes to do that by also offering more Latino-oriented classes, such as the 
class on "Chicano Culture in America." 
</P>
<P>
"The course cuts across different disciplines," Mendoza said. "We wanted to 
make it attractive for teachers, as well as for Latinos to have an opportunity 
to learn more about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Among the Latino-related courses that will be offered during the winter 
quarter, which starts Jan. 5, is "Marketing and Advertising Effectively to the 
Hispanic Consumer." Information about UCLA Extension is available at (213) 
825-8261.

NO NEED TO TRAVEL FAR FOR FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Back-yard vacations have some real advantages: they don't cost much money and 
they don't take a lot of time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid to spend too much money these days, and we can't go too far 
because of horrendous gas prices," said Martha McDonough, an Escondido 
housewife with three children under the age of 12. 
</P>
<P>
McDonough and her husband, a computer programmer, say the family will take day 
trips during the Christmas holiday. "We'll finally see what's in our own back 
yard," said Jim McDonough. 
</P>
<P>
Community attractions -- such as museums -- are sometimes slow to be discovered 
by the people who live near them. 
</P>
<P>
"Locals take all this for granted," said Guy Woodward, curator of the Guy B. 
Woodward Museum in Ramona. Woodward, 81, is referring to the 
turn-of-the-century museum that carries his name and is considered tops by 
historical societies in the state. "We've been judged twice as the best 
backcountry museum in California." 
</P>
<P>
Up the road a bit is the Julian Pioneer Museum, visited by more than 75,000 
people a year, most from outside the area. "Not a day goes by that we don't see 
somebody from a foreign country," said curator Mabel Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
The typical North County museum differs from the larger, more traditional 
museum where the atmosphere is formal and collections are perfectly arranged, 
enshrined and guarded. Hometown museums are family-oriented, educational and 
lively places that offer something for young and old. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, at the Quail Botanical Gardens in Encinitas, there is a tour for 
3- and 4-year-old children, designed to teach young minds how early man 
survived off the land; the Anza-Borrego Visitor Center in Borrego Springs has 
an audio tape of sounds and conversations recorded during the 1968 Borrego 
earthquake; and at the Antique Gas &amp; Steam Engine Museum in Vista, 
mechanical buffs examine restored, operational farm equipment, such as a 
hillside harvester built in 1917 with gears that cranked manually and required 
a crew of 5 to run. 
</P>
<P>
No rules or regulations govern the formation of a museum, community-based or 
otherwise, although most have nonprofit status and are affiliated with a 
historical society. Some receive support from local, state or federal agencies. 
On a day-to-day basis, they tend to be managed and staffed by dedicated, 
knowledgeable volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of good museums in North County that cost little, if 
anything, to enjoy. Most request donations, though. The museums that aren't 
right in your neighborhood are probably within a 60-minute drive from home. 
</P>
<P>
GUY B. WOODWARD MUSEUM 
</P>
<P>
645 Main St., Ramona 
</P>
<P>
(619) 789-7644 
</P>
<P>
Open 1-4 p.m., Thursday through Sunday; closed holidays. 
</P>
<P>
When Guy Woodward and his wife were vacationing in Hawaii some years ago, 
members of the Ramona Historical Society took a vote and changed the name of 
their museum. "Darned if I didn't come home to find they'd named the museum 
after me," said Woodward, who dresses in Western attire, looks every bit the 
cowboy part, and is undoubtedly the perfect volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Although several wooden structures dot the museum property, the centerpiece is 
a beautifully restored 1886 French Provincial home called the Verlaque house, 
named after its original owner. Authentic interior furnishings include a baby 
grand piano made in Austria in 1870 for the king of Austria. The library serves 
as an ongoing historical data center and is used by faculty and students from 
several area universities. A gift shop is in the basement, along with 
memorabilia from famed cowboy Casey Tibbs. 
</P>
<P>
Outside are authentic Western buildings that were relocated and restored with 
help from the California Conservation Corps. An 1880 medicine wagon, once 
pulled by a team of horses, now has a 1926 Chevrolet engine and is fully 
operational. According to Woodward, children love the 7-ton jail where 
prisoners were once kept. "If they were like that today, these people wouldn't 
be so anxious to get back into them," said Woodward, a former agent with the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
JULIAN PIONEER MUSEUM 
</P>
<P>
2811 Washington St., Julian 
</P>
<P>
(619) 765-0227 
</P>
<P>
Open 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday, Sunday, legal holidays (except Christmas, 
Thanksgiving, and New Year's Day). Open daily from April 1 through November. 
May be closed due to snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the Julian Woman's Club and a large number of civic and political 
organizations, the Julian Pioneer Museum opened its doors in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
The building was originally a brewery and later a blacksmith shop. After two 
restorations, it has now been restored to its original turn-of-the-century 
configuration. Bursting with artifacts donated by local Julian pioneer 
families, the museum consists of a three-room structure. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest artifact is a small wall sampler from the 1700s. Carlson said the 
Weber square piano dating back to the 1880s is a favorite and catches 
everyone's eye. And the museum's collection of lace is "one of the best 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Julian's first pool table is one of the larger exhibits. On the smaller side, 
but no less intriguing, are a pair of thick, uncomfortable looking contact 
lenses, circa 1940. 
</P>
<P>
ANZA-BORREGO DESERT VISITOR CENTER 
</P>
<P>
Anza-Borrego State Park 
</P>
<P>
Borrego Springs 
</P>
<P>
(619) 767-4684 (recorded message) 
</P>
<P>
Open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily, October through May; 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Saturday, Sunday 
and holidays, June through September. 
</P>
<P>
 Park rangers and volunteers say a day trip will "whet your appetite" for 
exploring the Anza-Borrego Desert Park, the largest state park in California. 
This 600,000-acre retreat encompasses one of the richest living museums in the 
country. To understand what the desert is all about, a visit to the 
7,000-square-foot Visitor Center is a good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 years and $1 million, this subterranean structure emerged in 1979. 
Through use of native rock and desert landscaping, the building blends nicely 
into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-minute video runs every half hour and provides commentary and slides about 
camping sites in Palm Canyon, nature trails with self-guided maps, and canyon 
trails that are perfect for horseback riders and people with four-wheel-drive 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
After watching the video, you'll want to proceed to the room where artifacts 
and pictorial exhibits are displayed. One of the first displays is an Imperial 
Mammoth fossil found in the desert and believed to be from the Pleistocene age. 
</P>
<P>
If your visit coincides with a tour of the "back room," you will see 
fascinating artifacts of preserved animals, pelts, pottery and even a large 
oyster shell dating back millions of years when the area was under water. 
</P>
<P>
The center has a large gift shop with an extensive book inventory. Ask for a 
complimentary copy of the Anza-Borrego Desert newspaper, which is published 
annually. This contains a calendar of events that lists special seminars 
dealing with the fossil life of Anza Borrego, animals of the desert, tours of 
the paleontology lab and numerous other regularly scheduled events. 
</P>
<P>
Brochures and maps are available for those who want to take any one of the 
several self-guided hikes.

<P>
Palomar Mountain 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland National Forest 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The dome and museum are open 9 a.m.-4 p.m. daily, except Dec. 24 and 25. The 
gift shop is open weekends during the winter, and daily from July 1-Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors are sometimes disappointed to learn they cannot peek through the 
200-inch Hale telescope that is inside the 1,000-ton rotating dome atop Palomar 
Mountain. The telescope is owned and used for research by faculty and students 
at the California Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
However, a glassed-in viewing platform provides an awesome view of the 
telescope that has been in continual operation since 1948. Its movable parts 
weigh about 530 tons. 
</P>
<P>
The mirror weighs 14.5 tons and has a range of well over 1 billion light-years, 
or 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Just inside the entryway of the dome is a replica of a reflecting-type 
telescope built by Sir Isaac Newton in 1668. That telescope was the forerunner 
for the Hale telescope, built three centuries later. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've had a chance to see the telescope, it is a short walk to the 
Greenway Museum where pictures and a video explain the telescope and how it is 
being used to unfold the mysteries of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors learn that light pollution has seriously inhibited the effectiveness 
of the Palomar Observatory. The rapid urbanization of Southern California has 
increased the amount of sky glow. The observation capacity of the 200-inch lens 
has already been reduced to 140 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Since the elevation of the observatory is 5,500 feet, it is wise to take along 
some warm clothing. Picnic tables are nearby.

QUAIL BOTANICAL GARDENS 
</P>
<P>
230 Quail Gardens Drive, Encinitas 
</P>
<P>
(619) 436-3036 
</P>
<P>
$1 parking fee is requested. 
</P>
<P>
Closed Dec. 17-Jan. 1, but otherwise open daily 8 a.m.-5 p.m.; gift shop hours

</P>
<P>
 The Quail Botanical Gardens includes a living museum where more than 5,000 
plant species flourish. Gardeners and naturalists will enjoy trekking through 
15 acres of plant life (another 15 acres are closed and designated a refuge for 
wildlife). 
</P>
<P>
Originally a private residence, the property was deeded to the county in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
Frost-free growing conditions provide a home away from home for tropical plants 
such as ferns, palms and uncommon fruit. You can see the West's largest 
collection of hibiscus and the largest grouping of the bamboo species in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
A demonstration garden has been created to educate homeowners about ways to use 
native plants in low water-use landscaping. Free tours are given every Saturday 
beginning at 10 a.m. The toddler's tour takes place the first Tuesday of every 
month at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Docents say the botanical gardens have become a favorite place for wedding 
ceremonies and family portraits. If interested, call the office for more 
information.

<P>
ANTIQUE GAS &amp; STEAM ENGINE MUSEUM 
</P>
<P>
240 N. Santa Fe Ave., Vista. 
</P>
<P>
(619) 941-1791 
</P>
<P>
Open daily 10 a.m.-4 p.m.; Closed Christmas and New Years. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated in a rapidly diminishing rural neighborhood in Vista, the Antique Gas 
&amp; Steam Engine Museum is a find for anyone interested in farm life at the 
turn of the century or vintage machinery. About 1,100 members of the California 
Early Days Gas Engine &amp; Tractor Assn. collect and restore artifacts on the 
40-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the machinery is in working condition and is put into action when the 
club stages two major Threshing Bee &amp; Antique Engine shows during the third 
and fourth weekends of June and October. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can walk the grounds and see vintage tractors, thrashers, hand-cranked 
autos and horse-drawn carts. Be sure to notice a large piece of equipment, 
which is a Fairbanks Morse 25,000-kilowatt generator. This was the generator 
that powered Catalina during the 1920s and 1930s. Not far from the generator is 
a steam-operated saw mill and a one-third scale train. 
</P>
<P>
The museum building houses most of the restored or valuable equipment, like an 
Foos gasoline engine and a 1930 Buick Master Six Tractor. Collectors will be 
interested in the large assortment of oil cans that have evolved over the 
years. Along these same lines are displays of barbed wire dating to the 
mid-1800s. Another building houses a blacksmith and wheelwright shop. Members 
gather on the first Saturday of each month for blacksmithing classes. 
</P>
<P>
HERITAGE WALK 
</P>
<P>
Grape Day Park, Escondido 
</P>
<P>
(619) 743-8207 
</P>
<P>
Open 1 p.m.-4 p.m., Thursday through Saturday; Closed Dec. 22, 27, 28, 29. 
</P>
<P>
Historic structures and artifacts were relocated to Grape Day Park initially as 
a local tribute to the nation's Bicentennial in 1976. The effort was 
spearheaded by the Escondido Historical Society and supported by civic and 
community leaders. Today, the complex has grown and serves as a showcase for 
other heritage parks. 
</P>
<P>
The heritage walk begins with a visit to Escondido's first library, which dates 
to 1894 and retains its original facade. Escondido Historical Society Director 
Norm Syler has an office inside the library. The library also serves as a gift 
shop and storehouse for historical archives. 
</P>
<P>
One of the popular attractions is the Victorian home, circa 1890. It has been 
restored through careful research and collaboration with the Hoffmann family, 
former residents of the home for many years. Most of the furnishings were 
donated by local residents. This year the historical society threw a 100th 
birthday party for the house, and Syler said three of the Hoffmann daughters 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
Children enjoy the 1888 Santa Fe Depot best of all, according to Syler. It has 
been restored close to its original condition and even old graffiti remain on 
one of the walls. For many years the depot served as the communication center 
for Escondido residents. Today, children can try their hand at tapping out 
messages on a telegraph machine. Artifacts such as the original roll-front 
ticket cabinet, a huge safe and old typewriters serve as reminders of bygone 
days. Behind the depot is a railroad car, circa 1925. 
</P>
<P>
OLD POWAY PARK 
</P>
<P>
Midland Road, Poway 
</P>
<P>
Completion set for 1991 
</P>
<P>
Construction coordinator/historian is Frank Lorey, (619) 486-4114. 
</P>
<P>
Although the museum complex is still under construction, it is expected to be 
completed next year. The 5-acre complex will be similar to the Heritage Walk in 
Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Already visible are the railroad station and locomotive barn that will be fully 
functional when finished. The old Templar's Hall, the Armstrong house and the 
Porter house have already been relocated to the property and are undergoing 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's centerpiece will likely be the restored 1907 Baldwin-built steam 
engine that was originally used in the San Francisco area. Poway resident Col. 
Porter used to run it on weekends until his death in 1963.

CITRUS ADDS A TANGY FLAVOR TO HOLIDAY FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KITTY MORSE, Kitty Morse is a free-lance writer and cookbook author living 
in Vista. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bright orange tangerines, as festive as Christmas ornaments, are ripening just 
in time to add a colorful touch to holiday fruit platters. 
</P>
<P>
Varieties such as the Satsuma, Dancy, Kara, and Kinnow tangerines are all 
expected to be plentiful in North County this year. The sweet and seedless 
Satsuma, generally the first one to reach market, is available for only a few 
weeks, while other varieties are expected to last through February. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Atkins of Atkins Nursery in Fallbrook is a world-renowned nurseryman who 
has been in the citrus business since the 1930s. Addressing a recent meeting of 
the California Rare Fruit Growers Assn., Atkins elaborated on the various kinds 
of tangerines now being produced in the North County. 
</P>
<P>
The sweet and seedless Satsuma is so highly prized in Japan that it is often 
sold stuffed in colorful stockings for gift-giving, according to Atkins. 
Although a favorite of local consumers, the Satsuma does not ship well and so 
has never gone over big elsewhere in California. Supermarkets rely on hardier 
varieties such as the Algerian tangerine, which Atkins qualifies as a "good, 
all-around tangerine," or the Kara mandarin, which makes a later appearance on 
the market. The Kinnow, tight-skinned and sweet, will last well into summer, he 
said. As for the Dancy, "the old-timer has been around forever." 
</P>
<P>
"My father planted the first mandarin (or tangerine) trees here in 1955," 
explains Vic Pankey of Pankey Farms in Bonsall, "and ours is one of the oldest 
groves in North County." 
</P>
<P>
His 12 acres of Satsuma trees make him the largest commercial grower in the 
county. "The Satsuma, originally from China, differs from other tangerines in 
that it is seedless, and very easy to peel," he says. "Strictly speaking, it's 
a mandarin orange. But to avoid confusion, we call them like our customers call 
them, tangerines." 
</P>
<P>
Pankey sells his tangerines to the public exclusively through his farm stand, 
or via UPS. 
</P>
<P>
Cal-Flavor, another commercial grower, deals mainly in Lee mandarins. "It's 
excellent and sweet. You can eat it like candy, it has so few seeds," declares 
Greg Thatcher, packing house manager and head of sales for the company. 
Cal-Flavor also grows the Satsuma at ranches throughout Valley Center. Because 
of shipping problems, Cal-Flavor sells the Satsuma mainly to local stores and 
farm stands. 
</P>
<P>
Margie Oakes of Oakes' Knoll Ranch in Fallbrook, can barely keep up with the 
demand for the seedless Satsuma. "My market customers start asking me as early 
as October when the tangerines are going to be ready," she said. "Our trees are 
loaded this season. The Satsuma should be available until Christmas, but 
everything we grow depends on the weather." 
</P>
<P>
The small, candy-tasting fruit is a favorite, especially among children. 
</P>
<P>
"People prefer seedless varieties of tangerines. They're ideal for children's 
lunches. My grandbabies just pick them off the tree and eat them as fast as 
they can pick them," she said. Oakes also grows Dancy tangerines, which should 
come into season toward the beginning of January. "Their taste is a little bit 
stronger than the Satsuma," says the Newport Beach native. 
</P>
<P>
The Satsuma is also the tangerine of choice for Joseph Bernard of Bernard 
Ranch, who has lived in Escondido for more than 35 of his 70 years as a farmer. 
Bernard still devotes most of his time to his 18 acres of fruit trees, many of 
them Satsuma tangerines. 
</P>
<P>
He is also experimenting with other varieties of tangerines to see how the 
public will take to them. These days, Bernard leaves the marketing to his sons 
and to other local sellers such as Marty Warren, who sells Bernard's 
tangerines, as well as his own fruit, at the Escondido, Vista, and Del Mar 
farmers' markets. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Souther, another market vendor and Satsuma grower, said that when he found 
out how popular the Satsuma was, he put in more trees. "The fruit isn't ready 
until it attains a dark, orange color," he said. "If it's too pale, the sugar 
isn't up." 
</P>
<P>
When buying tangerines, look for a deep orange color, and discard any that feel 
"mushy" to the touch. Beware of blotches of color on the skin. Tangerines, 
mandarins, and clementines are best when eaten out of hand, and add a wonderful 
flavor to fresh fruit salads. The Satsuma is ideal for preserves or canning. 
All citrus is a good source of Vitamin C and fiber. 
</P>
<P>

DAVID NELSON / ON RESTAURANTS: ENCINITAS' MANDARIN NO LONGER TOWERS OVER 
CHINESE CUISINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At its opening nearly 10 years ago, Mandarin Tower in Encinitas was 
exceptional, thanks to an energetic management and to the faithful renderings 
of classic dishes by a Peking-born and -trained chef. But the energy has waned: 
While the cooking and service today are adequate, it no longer serves a 
compelling Chinese cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant lists pot stickers on the menu page devoted to house 
specialties, but the dish is merely average. Other specialties are more 
notable. The panda pork, presented on a bed of crushed, deep-fried noodles, has 
a pleasantly chewy texture and a subtle flavor that mingles sweet and spicy 
undertones. The yu-shiang shrimp, while very much a standard dish, also is well 
done, and the shrimp take well to the Szechuan treatment that again mingles a 
bit of sweetness with an underlying but far from overpowering heat. 
</P>
<P>
The crispy chicken in hot garlic sauce, highly touted by the restaurant as a 
special among specials, was not a particularly happy dish, since the chunks of 
chicken lacked crispness and had a rewarmed quality; what was likeable was the 
small garden of vegetables in pungent brown sauce that garnished the bites of 
bird. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer list is so perfunctory that the restaurant seems to be telling 
its guests that it knows what they want, and that they want egg rolls, crisped 
won ton or fried jumbo shrimp. There is the alternative of the dreaded "pu-pu 
platter" (the name probably originated at one of those pseudo-Polynesian 
restaurants that flourished in the 1960s), which includes tastes of all of 
these as well as such tidbits as skewered beef, all to be heated over the open 
flame that burns bluish-orange in the center of the platter. 
</P>
<P>
There is a greater range of options among the soups, although, once again, the 
selection sticks to the basics. The sour-hot soup is pungent, somewhat hot and 
respectable, while the very Cantonese Imperial soup includes a more than 
generous amount of minced shrimp among the water chestnuts and vegetables 
stirred into an egg white-thickened broth. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of standard entrees again seems to take the point of view that 
guests have relatively narrow tastes. There are sweet-sour dishes in the 
expected manifestations (chicken, pork and shrimp); moo shu beef and pork; 
assorted kung pao offerings and, in an interesting return to the Chinese menus 
of other days, a foo young made with barbecued pork. 
</P>
<P>
Among the poultry choices is a good sliced chicken with vegetables that, while 
mild, also is delicate, an important distinction. Also on the positive side is 
the lengthy list of seafood dishes, which extends beyond the usual shrimp with 
cashews to Mandarin-style lobster and the whole fish of the day, served 
sweet-and-sour or braised in hot sauce.

WHERE THE MOON HITS YOUR EYE LIKE A BIG PIZZA PIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Things were deathly quiet the other night at Cielo Mare, the restaurant in the 
Waterfront Hilton at Huntington Beach. It's a huge place, this restaurant, and 
the only people in it were two couples (neither of which were doing much 
talking). By contrast, noise was pouring from a hotel function room where a 
giant office party was in progress. The restaurant deserves a better fate. 
</P>
<P>
The funny thing is that this restaurant seems to do a brisk business at lunch, 
when it's often filled with small groups of women, business people and those 
who come alone to dine by the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
But I think the place looks a whole lot more romantic in the moonlight. The 
decor is more of that pastel and earth-tone stuff that you get from Hilton all 
over the world; in this case, it's a cross between Louis XIV and Georgia 
O'Keeffe. The hotel bills itself as a Mediterranean resort, and that's 
somewhere in the ballpark. It reminds me of one of those places you see on the 
Mexican Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant itself has been done with taste and flair. Chairs are 
high-backed and plush. There is an abundance of space between tables. The three 
dining areas are full of little archways and alcoves, all of which are painted 
a soft beige. There is a trompe-l'oeil ceiling painted sky blue over one 
portion of the restaurant (cielo means sky in Italian), and a wide panorama of 
the Pacific, just across PCH (mare means sea). From this restaurant at night, 
the moon really does hit your eye like a big pizza pie. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant serves pizza only at lunch, though. Despite its name, this isn't 
really an Italian restaurant. I'd call it Continental: a patchwork of 
California, Italian and nouvelle. Still, you eat very well here, in almost any 
genre. 
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime, the menu is intelligently grounded in light, outdoorsy fare. 
There is a good stracciatella (Italian egg-drop soup with spinach) and a 
wonderful black bean soup that comes artistically swirled with creme fraiche 
and a tomato salsa. 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't recommend the crab cake as an appetizer. It's indifferently 
flavored, and a bit matted in texture. Instead, I'd go for one of the salads. 
The Cobb is particularly good with all the ingredients -- including an 
eccentric ancho chile chicken -- in discrete clumps around the greens, rather 
than all mixed in. The Caesar is made with really fresh greens (but I do prefer 
my Caesars a little stronger in the anchovy department). 
</P>
<P>
There are some good pastas. Spinach fettuccine with smoked chicken is a real 
surprise: The noodles are coated in a creamy Alfredo-type sauce and the chicken 
has an intense, almost herbal aftertaste. It's plenty for two, and the kitchen 
will be happy to split it. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner menu is more formal, more of what you'd expect from a hotel. The 
cold appetizers are especially well-conceived. A tender calamari vinaigrette is 
served with fresh tomato, onion and capers; it's one of the truly Italian 
things on the menu. Seared lamb carpaccio is about as far from Harry's Bar in 
Venice (where carpaccio originated) as Casablanca is from Rome. The lamb has 
been thoroughly cooked, for starters, and is served in thick slices with spiced 
couscous. However, it's delicious. 
</P>
<P>
The hot appetizers are more Continental in form and spirit. Lobster ravioli 
come with a chive-crayfish cream. Grilled sea scallops float in a Montrachet 
wine and sage sauce. 
</P>
<P>
As in most hotel dining rooms, the aim here is to please a wide variety of 
guests, taking few chances in the process. Largely, Cielo Mare succeeds. You 
can have just about anything for a main dish here. The waiter told us that if 
the menu wasn't to our liking, we could ask the chef to make us what was. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't necessary. We could have had soft shell crab with cilantro pesto or 
breast of duck with wild boar sausage. Or we could have taken one of the 
kitchen's spa alternatives such as cold sea bass with mango or broiled chicken 
breast with papaya. It wasn't easy to choose. 
</P>
<P>
We went for the broiled breast of chicken stuffed with goat cheese and fresh 
herbs, and were totally happy with it. We also ordered crusted lamb loin with 
mint sauce and a fig relish, done to perfect pinkness. The fig relish was an 
inspired complement. My only complaint was that the meat tasted suspiciously 
like a hot version of the carpaccio. 
</P>
<P>
Cielo Mare doesn't make its own desserts (the hotel opened in the spring and 
hasn't got around to hiring a pastry chef). You choose from a fancy cart with 
some store-bought cakes and tortes -- apple, cheesecake, Bailey's Irish cream 
cake. Not very exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a little excitement after dinner? Well, there's this party . . . 
Cielo Mare is moderately expensive. Appetizers are $6.95 to $7.95. Soups and 
salads are $3 to $6.25. Pastas are $16.25 to $18.50. Entrees are $16.95 to 
$22.95.

HEAT PUSHES MARINE TO SEEK DISCHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An angry Camp Pendleton Marine, home from Saudi Arabia, is seeking a medical 
discharge because of his intolerance to the heat and complains that his unit 
commanders were callous to him when he collapsed, despite Navy doctors' 
insistence that he be evacuated from his desert outpost. 
</P>
<P>
Pfc. Roger Kendall said he was one of many Marines in Saudi Arabia who 
collapsed in the heat -- and who got no sympathy from commanding officers. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors were all complaining for me. They said I could die, but my captain 
said that (release from duty) would ruin morale because, if I got out, others 
would want to, too, and that the only way I'd get out was in a body bag. 
</P>
<P>
"Then they told me that, if I refused to run, I'd be put in the brig and would 
lose my pay. So all I could do was run, to push myself, until I'd black out 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, who turns 20 on Sunday, said he fainted from heat a dozen or more 
times during his six weeks in Saudi Arabia. Medical documents in his personnel 
file show that his body-core temperature reached 108 degrees at one time, and 
was more than 104 degrees several other times. Body-core temperatures of 105 
degrees or higher can bring on heat stroke, medical authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, whose request for a medical discharge has yet to go before military 
authorities at Camp Pendleton, said he is speaking out because "people need to 
know how Marines are being treated" by their unit commanders in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got my case (for medical discharge) made, for sure," Kendall said at his 
Fallbrook home. But, he said, "People have been going down worse than me over 
there. That's why I'm saying this. This is the truth of how Marines are being 
treated there." 
</P>
<P>
Kendall said that on one occasion when he fell from the heat he was kicked in 
the ribs and the head by superiors who tried to get him to stand up. Other 
times, he said, he was accused of "faking it" even though, according to medical 
reports, he was brought in to battalion aid stations unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't fake a 108-degree temperature," he said. "Maybe you could bring it 
on by not drinking water, but, after I was brought in the first time, they 
monitored how much water I was drinking. I was going through five to eight 
(one-quart) canteens a day, and I was still collapsing when I went back out." 
</P>
<P>
Kendall was finally ordered out of Saudi Arabia on Oct. 3 after requesting mast 
(meetings with higher-ranking officers) and finally getting access, he said, to 
a sympathetic superior. 
</P>
<P>
His final medical report, signed by a Navy doctor identified by his signature 
as J. LaRorque, reads: "Medical evacuation to CONUS (Continental United States) 
is recommended because pt (patient) experienced episode of heat stroke. He is 
now excessively vulnerable to heat stress, and thus no longer fit for duty." 
</P>
<P>
That same doctor wrote in a different report: "Core temperature of 108 + 
unconsciousness = heat stroke. Pt. is permanently vulnerable to heat stress, 
thus unfit for duty." 
</P>
<P>
That was the last in a series of medical reports documenting his condition -- 
reports, he said, that were ignored by his unit, the assault weapons platoon of 
Lima Company, 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines Regiment of the 1st Marine Division 
out of Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall says that, given the lack of cooperation from his unit commanders in 
Saudi Arabia, he expects to face opposition here to a medical discharge and is 
enlisting the help of an attorney in San Diego to press his case for a 
discharge with medical disability payments. 
</P>
<P>
Staff Sgt. Vicki Turney, a Marine Corps spokeswoman at Camp Pendleton, said 
Kendall's request would go before a medical review board, "which will make the 
determination whether he is still fit for duty. There's been no determination 
as of this point as to what type discharge, if any, that Kendall would receive. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still a Marine, and his discharge, if any, is pending," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kendall is performing limited duties at Camp Pendleton, including 
daily flag raising and lowering and light office chores. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall said he first fell from heat while training at the Twentynine Palms 
combat training base in San Bernardino County. According to medical documents, 
Kendall experienced "weakness, blurry vision, headache, nausea, vomiting, 
profuse sweating . . . and upper-extremity numbness." 
</P>
<P>
A week later, he was deployed to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
The first recommendation that Kendall be flown back to the United States came 
Aug. 23, according to medical records. That day, records show, he collapsed and 
"appeared unconscious" while on a series of exercises, and was taken to a 
battalion aid station. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy doctor who examined Kendall that day noted that Kendall "had a more 
severe heat injury 48 hours ago," when his core body temperature reached 108 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"My medical recommendation is that this patient be Med-evac'd back to U.S. 
ASAP, and that he have no PT (physical training), no exercise, and no outside 
exposure (for) seven days. These recommendations have been made in person by 
myself and Dr. Roegner to the battalion XO, Major Vrabel," wrote a Navy doctor 
identified only as Lt. Cmdr. Naylor. 
</P>
<P>
Later that same day, Roegner wrote: 
</P>
<P>
Patient "was (treated) for heat exhaustion as above, 48 hours ago. 
Recommendation at that time was LD x 72 (light duty for 72 hours). This was 
conveyed to his platoon commander, Lt. Eichorn, at that time. Per patient 
tonight, he was made to run (within) 24 hours release from medical care for the 
first heat exhaustion, in 100 (degree) temperature. Then today, (he) was made 
to run twice (once in a.m. and once at night) where he became heat exhausted 
again. I concur with the above notes" by Naylor. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 26, another medical report by Roegner said Kendall had been brought in 
at the request of his battalion commanding officer "for evaluation of further 
service in the desert." 
</P>
<P>
The evaluation was necessary "because of possible malingering charges being 
brought up by the company," the report noted. The doctor, Roegner, said that, 
although Kendall was still suffering from diarrhea, he was otherwise "fully 
acclimatized and fit for full duty." 
</P>
<P>
Kendall argues that Roegner's prognosis -- that he was fit for duty -- was the 
result of pressures from his unit that he be returned to his duty post. After 
that, Kendall said, he formally sought Mast, to speak to higher-ups. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't ask for Mast, I wouldn't have been able to see any more doctors," 
he said. "They weren't going to give me any more medical treatment." 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 1, he was seen by Dr. Frederick Morgan, a Navy lieutenant commander 
serving as a regimental surgeon, who summarized Kendall's condition this way: 
"Since arriving in Saudi Arabia, he (Kendall) states he was treated by a 
corpsman, sometimes he received no treatment, and was brought to BAS (Battalion 
Aid Station) on three occasions which are documented. 
</P>
<P>
"The physician's note 8/23 indicates heat stroke with a core temperature of 108 
degrees rectal, a life threatening condition, on 8/21/90. 
</P>
<P>
"This was followed by a case of heat exhaustion with core temperature of 104 
degrees rectal 8/23/90. Dr. Naylor found him unfit for desert field service and 
recommended Medevac to U.S. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, the medical record clearly reveals that (patient) was made to perform 
rigorous physical activity on several occasions within 48 hours after heat 
stroke, in temperatures exceeding 100 degrees F, in spite of medical 
contraindications communicated to 3/9 Battalion Executive Officer and platoon 
commander. 
</P>
<P>
"This contradicted physical activity was directly responsible for his treatment 
failure on 23 Aug. (heat exhaustion) and again on 24 Aug (heat cramps). 
</P>
<P>
"There is also an undocumented case on 25 Aug when he went down during P.T. 
(physical training) and was kicked and slapped in the presence of the platoon 
sgt, co. 1st sgt and platoon commander. He was brought to the BAS incoherent 
and likely unconscious since he received a sternal rub," in which the chest is 
rubbed firmly with knuckles to elicit a response from the victim. 
</P>
<P>
"He clearly remembers the acute sternal pain for several days. He also admits 
to bruises on his body," Morgan wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The last documented heat injury was Sept. 11, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor concluded: "His lowered endurance is highly susceptible to repeat 
injury which may be complicated by death." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, doctors ordered him returned to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Corps officials at Camp Pendleton said they were unable to address 
charges by Kendall as to the treatment he sustained from his unit in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
And the public affairs office for the joint-forces Central Command in Saudi 
Arabia said they did not immediately know how many troops have been returned to 
the United States because of heat problems there. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, meanwhile, is unsure of his future. "I can't do labor because I can't 
get overheated. I can't even have sex without overheating and getting dizzy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a wife and a 7-week-old son to support, and I don't have any other 
skills. The only skill I have is to blow things up," he said.

SAN DIEGO TEACHERS VOTE FOR A UNION SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 73% of San Diego city schools teachers have approved a proposal to 
require all of them to pay mandatory union dues beginning next July, increasing 
the coffers of their bargaining agent, the San Diego Teachers Assn., by 
one-fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Ballots were counted Wednesday by the state Public Employees Relations Board on 
the proposal that school district trustees agreed in November 1988 to allow a 
vote on, in return for the union assenting to a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 6,418 teachers eligible to vote, 4,194 returned valid ballots, with 
3,963 yes votes and 1,131 no votes. 
</P>
<P>
The results for the so-called "closed shop" puts San Diego teachers into the 
same position as those in other major urban educational systems in California 
-- Oakland, Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Francisco, Fresno, Sacramento and San 
Jose -- who pay for representation whether or not they agree with the 
philosophy of organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
Up until now, only about 4,100, or 60% of the district's teachers have been 
paying members of the union, although all teachers receive the same wages and 
benefits negotiated by the union and are entitled to representation in case of 
grievances against a principal or other administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The union will lower its $500 annual dues by $20 as a result of being able to 
collect from all teachers, Hugh Boyle, SDTA president, said Wednesday. Boyle 
estimated that some members will only pay 80% of the annual fees by forgoing 
optional services such as group liability insurance and legal benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Both Boyle and union executive director Bill Harju said Wednesday that the 
closed shop will allow the union more flexibility in pursuing efforts not 
traditionally thought of as within a labor union's purview. Those include the 
nascent collaborations under way with the school district on a wide variety of 
ways to change classroom instruction and to give teachers more responsibility 
for running schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, our best membership drive recruiting was when we would point to a bad 
principal" and encourage people to join, Harju said. Now, Harju and Boyle said, 
they can pursue precedent-breaking avenues without necessarily losing members 
who object to closer union-district relations. 
</P>
<P>
Added Frank Graham-Caso, a teacher at Mira Mesa High and longtime union member: 
"I think this will result in a more positive working relationship with the 
district and less confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
Graham-Caso said the results will eliminate a lot of tension at schools where 
some members have felt that non-members "were getting free rides" and where 
principals have sometimes used "divide-and-conquer" tactics between those who 
belonged to the union and those who did not. 
</P>
<P>
"Some non-members even said that they would vote for this," he said. "They were 
looking for a rationale to pay their fair share" 
</P>
<P>
The union will use some of its added funds to hire more staff to handle teacher 
complaints and will send more teachers to conferences on developing new ways of 
teaching. The union might expand its own small projects to lessen racial 
stereotyping by teachers and enhance multicultural instruction, Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. Tom Payzant said Wednesday that the traditional apprehension he 
and other administrators might otherwise feel about a more powerfully funded 
union are lessened by the new relationship being built between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
"In the traditional adversarial relationship, the extra resources would go into 
fueling conflict, confrontation and contention," Payzant said. "I don't have 
the concerns here, assuming the positive, collaborative relationship that we 
are developing continues."

Border Patrol agents seized more than 635 pounds of marijuana with a street 
value of more than $1 million in two unrelated incidents Wednesday, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A truck entering the United States illegally east of the San Ysidro border 
crossing at about 2:40 a.m. led agents on a 20-minute chase that ended in the 
7200 block of Otay Mesa Road. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen bundles of marijuana weighing a total of 460 pounds were found in the 
bed of the truck, officials said. Guadalupe Rodriguez Torres, 28, and Lauro 
Escatel Ramasco, 30, both of Mexico, were arrested on suspicion of unlawfully 
importing a controlled substance. A third suspect fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol agents also found five bags of marijuana weighing weighing a 
total of 175 pounds abandoned on a trail heavily used by immigrants 2 miles 
west of the border crossing, the statement said. No suspects were found.

The son of television evangelist Morris Cerullo pleaded guilty Wednesday to 
grand theft in the attempted theft of an air conditioner from a store. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than face a retrial, Mark Stephen Cerullo, 33, of San Diego, pleaded 
guilty to the felony charge before San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus 
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
A jury acquitted Cerullo on Dec. 10 of burglary in the same July 29 incident at 
the Home Depot on Sports Arena Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors deadlocked 9-3 for acquittal on the grand theft charge. 
</P>
<P>
Cerullo's sentencing was scheduled for Jan. 18. He remains free on $4,000 bond 
previously posted.

BATES' ABSENTEE BALLOT INQUIRY MAY BROADEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Accusing San Diego election officials of "covering up" their inability to 
properly verify absentee ballots, lawyer Mike Aguirre said Wednesday that he 
might ask a congressional committee to challenge Republican Randall (Duke) 
Cunningham's victory over Rep. Jim Bates. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest twist in his long-shot legal battle to help Bates overturn his 
narrow November loss to Cunningham, Aguirre, citing what he characterized as 
"sloppy or non-existent checking" of absentee ballots, threatened for the first 
time to carry his fight for the San Diego County Democrat beyond the courtroom 
to the House Administration Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to take every step possible to make sure there wasn't fraud in 
this election," Aguirre said. Similarly, Bates said that asking the 
congressional panel, which has jurisdiction over contested elections, to 
investigate is "something we probably ought to do as a backstop" to a court 
hearing on the matter scheduled for later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Both Cunningham's attorney, Steve Kane, and San Diego Registrar of Voters Conny 
McCormack, however, defended the handling of the absentee ballots as proper, 
dismissing the accusations of improprieties as grandstanding and political sour 
grapes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know what Mr. Aguirre is after other than getting his name in 
the paper, and Mr. Bates won't accept that he lost," Kane said. "There was 
nothing at all wrong with this election." 
</P>
<P>
In his Superior Court lawsuit, Aguirre charges that the registrar's office 
violated state law by failing to compare signatures on absentee ballot 
applications with voters' original registration records. McCormack, however, 
emphasizes that guidelines used by 37 California counties permit election 
officials to verify only the signature on the absentee ballot itself, not on 
the application. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre also has questioned the thoroughness of the signature verification on 
the 188,000 absentee ballots cast countywide in last month's election. 
Contending that most of those names received a "cursory at best" examination 
from temporary workers, Aguirre has expressed doubt that many absentee ballots 
were checked at all for their authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to bolster his case, Aguirre, using a handwriting expert equipped with a 
stopwatch, conducted experiments at the registrar's office Wednesday that he 
contends showed that the signatures could not be verified via computer nearly 
as quickly as election officials previously claimed.

In response to "Volunteer Force: Is It Truly Fair?" (Column One, Dec. 6): 
</P>
<P>
You missed half the population in asking the question, who will die if fighting 
starts? Why are women not required to register for the draft as all men are? 
Why aren't women required to show responsibility to defend this country as all 
men are? 
</P>
<P>
Women ask for their rights and an end to bias against them. 
</P>
<P>
They desire both. But they should also ask for the responsibility of at least 
having a card that identifies them as ready to help this country in need. And 
please note, they don't have to go to the front lines, but can provide other 
valuable service. 
</P>
<P>
There is no excuse for not extending conscription requirements to women. It is 
an old saying, in dreams begin responsibilities. It is time to provide women 
with not only their rights, but with their responsibilities as well.

ANTI-SEMITISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his Dec. 10 letter, Teodor Polak criticizes Deborah Lipstadt for 
exaggerating the extent of anti-Semitism in Poland, indicating the actions, 
allegedly, of a few are used to tar an entire people. 
</P>
<P>
That can be a reasonable argument, but he undermines it by showing that he does 
not recognize his own anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
This chairman of the Polish American Congress, Los Angeles, blames Jews for the 
"bad fate" of contemporary Polish-Jewish relations. After all, Polak claims, 
"Communism was forced on Poland with significant participation by Polish Jews. 
The terror followed." 
</P>
<P>
Polak's twisted logic sadly exposes the hatred and ignorance that has helped 
perpetuate anti-Semitism in Poland.

HOW BEST TO PROTECT AND SERVE; 
</P>
<P>
LAPD SHOULD ACCEPT THE STATE CRITIQUE ON LATINO PROMOTIONS AND DO A BETTER JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates takes great pride in his department's 
reputation as one of the best in the world. So do the 21% of LAPD officers who 
happen to be Latino -- despite the fact statistics clearly indicate they have 
not always gotten a fair share of promotions. That's why it would only worsen a 
needless estrangement for the LAPD brass to fight a state agency's formal 
complaint that Latino officers are being held back by inconsistent personnel 
policies and inadequate affirmative action programs in the department. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and 
Housing, which monitors for discrimination both private and public employers in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
The agency began looking at the LAPD's promotion practices in 1988 at the 
request of the Latin American Law Enforcement Assn. (LA LEY, Spanish for "the 
law") -- a 1,000-member organization of Latino police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the troubling statistics state investigators compiled: Latinos in the 
LAPD are promoted at rates well below their Anglo counterparts. Last year, for 
example, 27% of the Anglos who applied for promotion moved up while only 16% of 
the Latinos did. This despite the fact that for a decade the LAPD has conducted 
an intensive recruitment effort to bring more women and minorities into its 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
The state filed its complaint in order to take the investigative process to the 
next step: negotiations. During negotiations, state specialists will probably 
move to advise the LAPD on changes that need to be made in its testing and 
interview procedures to make them fairer to Latino officers. The LAPD can 
either settle the case or contest the issue to an administrative law judge and 
the state Fair Employment Commission. 
</P>
<P>
But fighting this case would only make matters worse. It would convince many 
Latino street cops that their superiors either don't know what's going on or 
won't admit it. Worse, it would put Gates and other LAPD brass in the same 
stubborn stance Los Angeles County's Board of Supervisors have taken -- wasting 
money fighting a discrimination case when the evidence clearly shows 
discrimination against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
This matter should be settled as quickly and constructively as possible. It's 
the right thing to do. And if the department brass won't make that decision on 
its own, Mayor Bradley, his Police Commission and the City Council must insist 
on it. To needlessly fight this matter any further would be beneath the stature 
of the LAPD.

STAND UP AND BE COUNTED; 
</P>
<P>
NEEDED: AN EARLY YES OR NO VOTE AUTHORIZING THE POSSIBLE USE OF FORCE AGAINST 
IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush now suggests that he may be ready to ask Congress to endorse the 
use of force against Iraq. A willingness to seek specific congressional 
approval implies at least a bend in what until now has been the 
Administration's unyielding insistence that the President already possesses 
full constitutional authority to commit U.S. forces to war, without getting 
explicit legislative authorization beforehand. Should Bush make good on his 
hint by asking Congress to approve the use of force when it convenes on Jan. 3? 
He should, because a clear expression of congressional opinion is urgently 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
Congress and the President continue to joust over the two-centuries-old 
ambiguity in the Constitution touching on war-making powers. Congress has the 
legal responsibility to raise armies and declare war. The President, as 
commander-in-chief, has control over the military. Congress says that its 
constitutional role is clear; its leaders insist at a minimum on Congress' 
right to give or withhold approval prior to the President's ordering troops 
into combat. 
</P>
<P>
No modern President has been willing to accept that view. All have contended 
that for them to do so would be to dilute the lawful powers of the chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
The argument goes round and round and nothing is resolved. The courts, most 
recently in a suit brought by 54 House members, have repeatedly chosen to steer 
clear of involvement in this dispute. In normal times, the debate over war 
powers is largely of academic interest. In times of international crisis, like 
now, the confrontation becomes compelling. Yet it's evident that neither 
Congress nor the President is prepared to yield on what each regards as its 
constitutional responsibilities. The best course is to seek a political 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Bush should ask Congress when it comes back into session two weeks from now for 
an early yes or no vote authorizing the possible use of force against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress says yes, it may provide just the nudge needed to convince Saddam 
Hussein that the string has finally run out and that he dare not delay his 
withdrawal from Kuwait any longer. If Congress says no -- if, in effect, it 
says that the country does not support going to war -- then that would of 
course be a major political signal that the President could hardly ignore. A 
coherent foreign policy requires an end to the uncertainty, the pointless 
bickering and, yes, the cheap posturing. The question should go before 
Congress, and Congress should make its choice.

GUATEMALA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last month, The Times carried "A Hellish Life in 'Democratic' Guatemala" 
(Commentary, Nov. 11) which noted that "on Sept. 11 the anthropologist Myrna 
Mack was stabbed to death outside her office . . . and on Oct. 25, gunmen 
opened fire on the journalist Byron Barrera, gravely wounding him and killing 
his wife. His newspaper, La Epoca, was fire-bombed into submission in 1988." 
</P>
<P>
These two events led author George Black to conclude that Guatemala is "a state 
bent on extinguishing the breath of civil society." 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 3 The Times carried a news brief about members of the military garrison 
at Santiago Atitlan firing on a crowd of 1,500 people who were protesting the 
harassment of civilians. There were confirmed reports of 11 dead (including two 
children) and 19 wounded. Other sources claim 26 dead and 71 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the petitions of the villagers, President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo 
has agreed to have the military garrison closed. This is the first time there 
has been official acknowledgement that the military is out of control. But this 
is not enough. Those who did the killing will just be moved to another 
community and continue their criminal behavior. There must be a trial of those 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
When we are told that U.S. tax dollars are sent to countries as "aid," we get 
warm feelings that we are helping those in need. Too often that aid is used for 
destructive purposes and further imbalances societies run by oligarchies and 
dominated by the military. Such is the case in Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
All U.S. aid should be stopped until true democracy is restored. But at the 
very least U.S. aid should be held back until those responsible for the Atitlan 
massacre are prosecuted and punished.

SDG&amp;E SEEKS NEW TRASH PLANT PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. on Wednesday asked the state Public Utilities 
Commission to review -- and possibly nullify -- a contract that the utility 
signed in 1983, promising to buy electricity from the proposed trash-to-energy 
plant in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
The plant would generate enough electricity -- by burning trash -- to serve 
40,000 households. State law, sparked by the Arab oil embargo 10 years ago, 
requires public utilities to buy electricity from alternative, non-utility 
sources, at a price that takes into account what the utility would otherwise 
pay to generate that same electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Utility officials say the terms of the old contract will now cost its customers 
$45 million more than if the contract were renegotiated using today's costs for 
generating electricity, because it is now bound to 1983 electricity prices that 
were twice what they are now. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, SDG&amp;E officials acknowledge, is that they signed a contract 
that had no closing date -- even though such contracts today normally expire in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
The utility's complaint to the PUC is that the would-be developers of the 
controversial trash-burning power plant, North County Resource Recovery 
Associates, has not yet even begun to build it -- even though six years have 
passed since SDG&amp;E promised to pay 7.5 cents per kilowatt-hour of 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to sign a new contract today, we would pay about 3.5 cents per 
kilowatt-hour, or less than half (the contracted price)," said Joe Kloberdanz, 
regulatory affairs manager for SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
He said the utility hopes the PUC either will nullify the contract that it 
earlier endorsed, or at least order NCRRA to renegotiate a new one with terms 
more favorable to SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
PUC officials in San Francisco said the request was being reviewed by its legal 
affairs department. 
</P>
<P>
NCRRA is owned by Thermo Electron Corp.'s Energy Systems Division, whose 
president scoffed at SDG&amp;E's request. 
</P>
<P>
"We made no representation when the plant would be on line and we would begin 
selling electricity," said Jerry Davis. "The contract is open-ended with 
respect to the time requirement for our performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had batteries of lawyers look at our contract, and every single one of 
them has said it is an absolute, iron-clad agreement by SDG&amp;E," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
He argued that, although the price might seem high now, over the 30-year 
contract period and with built-in inflation escalators, the utility would end 
up with bargain-price electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Kloberdanz disagreed. "It's difficult to predict what we'd pay for electricity 
20 years from now, but we wouldn't enter that same contract today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NCRRA planned on using the revenue from the electricity sales to subsidize the 
cost of processing trash, by recycling some of it, burning some and burying the 
rest at the San Marcos landfill, next to the planned plant. 
</P>
<P>
Without SDG&amp;E's income, Davis said, the cost of handling the trash would 
have to be increased and eventually passed on to the customers -- according to 
county figures, $2 more a month per household. 
</P>
<P>
The trash plant, first proposed in 1982, is mired in legal challenges and a 
demand by Thermo Electron that its initial contract with the county be 
renegotiated because of increasing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Erwin, a long-time vocal critic of the trash plant, said he is "grateful" 
for SDG&amp;E's action. "If they're successful," Erwin said of SDG&amp;E, "it 
could very well mortally wound the incinerator because it will, for the first 
time, have to stand on its own economics, and the true cost of the plant's 
operation will become visible to the public."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
CONTAGIOUS DISEASE OF COMMITTEE-ITIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When in doubt, local governments often form a committee. But beware such 
unintended consequences of committee-itis as the guarding of turf and the 
swelling of egos. And then there's that bane of fiscal prudence, the padding of 
the municipal budget. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when everybody is trying to find ways to cut, it makes sense to do 
what the City Council in Irvine is endeavoring to accomplish. It is trying 
bravely to reduce the number of commissions that have been authorized over the 
years to look into various issues. This year-end pruning around the hedges of 
City Hall is a good example for other communities looking for ways to save some 
money. 
</P>
<P>
But, alas, committees and commissions do not seem to go gracefully into 
retirement. In Irvine, the city has accumulated a 10-page list of advisory 
boards created during the city's 19-year history. The various committees and 
commissions cost the city about $500,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Irvine, with a population less than half the size of Santa Ana, has 67 
assorted advisory boards to its neighbor's 11. Anaheim, another big Orange 
County city, has disciplined itself along the way so that it has only 13 
committees. Irvine has no target goal for the number of committees it wants to 
cut, but it recognizes that it has too many of them. It will eliminate some, 
consolidate others, and in the process no doubt affirm the value of those that 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
The trick for Irvine, and other communities so afflicted, is to weed out 
commissions that duplicate services without punishing those whose chief offense 
is controversy. 
</P>
<P>
An example of the latter is the 2-year-old Citizens Advisory Committee on 
International Affairs, targeted for the ax. It has become a symbol for the 
far-flung concerns of the administration of former Mayor Larry Agran, now so 
out of fashion in the council chambers. The committee is too big, all right. 
But reorganize it; don't eliminate it. There is a place for symbolic 
expressions, such as the committee's recent recommendation that, at official 
functions, the city boycott coffee grown in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The best place to focus is on committees that duplicate efforts or whose task 
is done. For example, even the members of the Public Safety Commission, another 
endangered committee, have been asking what their purpose is these days. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are groups such as the Pelican Hills Road Monitoring Committee and 
the Peters Canyon Wash Open Space Spine Monitoring Committee. Cities can 
economize on both money -- and words -- by eliminating committees such as 
these.

S.D. PLANT TO REAP SOME JOBS FROM EXPANSION OF KELCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Merck &amp; Co., the giant pharmaceutical firm, will spend $29 million to 
expand plants in San Diego and Oklahoma that produce biogums, materials used as 
thickening and suspending agents by the food-processing, oil-drilling and 
chemical industries. 
</P>
<P>
Less than half of the $29 million is earmarked for Merck's Kelco Division plant 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The lion's share will be used to expand a large Kelco facility in Okmulgee, 
Okla., said Steve Zapoticzny, Kelco's San Diego-based public affairs manager. 
</P>
<P>
Kelco has 600 employees in San Diego. The planned expansion will generate a 
"modest" number of new jobs, Zapoticzny said. 
</P>
<P>
Biogums, which are produced through fermentation processes, end up in a wide 
variety of consumer products. Kelco produces the materials at fermentation 
plants in San Diego, Oklahoma and England. 
</P>
<P>
Merck linked the expansion to increased demand from existing customers, along 
with new applications that are being made possible by new production 
techniques. Merck has, for example, received federal Food &amp; Drug 
Administration approval to sell biogums to bakeries, which will use the 
substances to improve the texture of pastry fillings and cake icings. 
</P>
<P>
The planned expansion will not affect Kelco's seaweed harvesting operation, 
which produces alginates, another type of thickening and suspending agents. 
Kelco has been harvesting seaweed from giant kelp beds in the Pacific since 
1929. 
</P>
<P>
Like biogums, alginates are used by a variety of industries. They are used to 
stabilize and improve the texture of salad dressings, baked goods, frozen foods 
and restructured meats. They are also used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic 
preparations. GREG JOHNSON

 The little Cornish hen may not have the size of its chicken brethren, but it's 
tasty and delicate, and it sits beautifully on any plate. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the hens were available only in the frozen meat case and 
consequently required long hours of thawing. But now you can buy them fresh. 
This makes it all the easier to get away from the old roast-and-stuff-it 
routine. Zapped in bubbling hot oil, the flesh is juicy and tender. Add the 
sweetish flavorings of Chinese five-spice powder, plus a hint of minced ginger 
and garlic. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a great big wok or deep-fryer large enough hold the bird covered in 
hot oil, cook the hens whole. Otherwise, cut the bird in half (or ask the 
butcher to do this for you) and fry the two halves. A half bird seems to be an 
ample serving for many people, particularly if you're worried about calories. 
The cooked hens may be kept warm in a 300-degree oven until the remaining 
pieces are done. 
</P>
<P>
If deep-frying is too messy for you, bake the seasoned birds at 400 degrees for 
10 minutes then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and roast for 40 
minutes longer or until tender. We cannot guarantee the same results with this 
method, however.

MICROWAVE: THE CARE AND ROASTING OF THE CORNISH HEN

<TEXT>
<P>
There are a couple of points to bear in mind: Never salt the hens until after 
they're cooked, because they may toughen and dry. And unless the hens are 
accompanied by a cover-up sauce, you'll need to brush them with a browning 
glaze. 
</P>
<P>
ROAST CORNISH HENS 
</P>
<P>
WITH MUSHROOM- 
</P>
<P>
BULGUR PILAF 
</P>
<P>
1 cup coarsely chopped mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 cup bulgur 
</P>
<P>
1 3/4 cups chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup coarsely chopped pecans 
</P>
<P>
2 (1 1/2- to 2-pound) Cornish hens 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons liquid gravy browner mixed with 3 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
Place mushrooms in butter in paper-towel-covered, microwave-safe 2 1/2-quart 
casserole. Microwave on HIGH (100% power) 2 minutes. Add bulgur and broth. 
Cover with casserole lid and microwave on HIGH 4 to 6 minutes until small 
bubbles appear at edge of casserole. 
</P>
<P>
Stir lightly, re-cover and microwave on MEDIUM (50% power) 9 to 10 minutes, 
without stirring, until almost all liquid is absorbed. Let stand, covered, 5 
minutes. Mix in salt, pepper and pecans. 
</P>
<P>
Loosely stuff body cavities of hens, allowing 1/3 cup stuffing for each, then 
skewer openings shut. Place remaining stuffing in lightly buttered 6-cup 
casserole. Cover with foil and set in conventional oven set at 300 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange hens, breast-side up, at least 1 inch apart in microwave-safe 
bake/roast pan with drumsticks toward center. Brush each bird with gravy 
browner glaze. Microwave hens, uncovered, on HIGH, allowing 6 to 8 minutes per 
pound (combined weight). When legs move easily in hip sockets and juices run 
clear, hens are done. 
</P>
<P>
Brush hens again with browning glaze, then let stand, uncovered, 5 minutes 
before serving. Accompany with remaining stuffing. Makes 4 servings.

CHEF'S SECRETS: CHECKERS' HASH: HOLD THE BEEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Duck hash, a takeoff on corned-beef hash, has become the most popular item on 
the breakfast/brunch menu at Checkers Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. It was 
developed by chef Jerry Comfort, who opened the Checkers kitchen, but recently 
moved on. 
</P>
<P>
"We've changed nothing," says acting chef Richard Allen. Instead of beef, duck 
is used, and artichokes are substituted for the potatoes. The result is a 
festive dish to put before any holiday brunch guest. 
</P>
<P>
Start the hash the night before. If you have leftover holiday bird, all the 
better. Saute the cooked meat with the artichoke mixture and top with poached 
eggs and Orange Hollandaise. A rose Champagne is a fitting accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
CHECKERS' DUCK HASH 
</P>
<P>
2 duck legs and thighs 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup chopped celery 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup chopped carrot 
</P>
<P>
1 sprig thyme 
</P>
<P>
3 black peppercorns 
</P>
<P>
2 cups chicken or duck stock or water to cover 
</P>
<P>
1 bay leaf 
</P>
<P>
6 small Italian artichokes or 1 (14-ounce) can quartered artichoke hearts, 
sliced into small wedges 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1 sweet red pepper, cut in fine julienne 
</P>
<P>
1/2 green pepper, cut in fine julienne 
</P>
<P>
1 onion, finely sliced 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 sprigs rosemary leaves, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
4 or 8 poached eggs 
</P>
<P>
Orange Hollandaise 
</P>
<P>
Italian parsley sprigs 
</P>
<P>
Segments from 1 orange 
</P>
<P>
Toasted bread slices 
</P>
<P>
Place duck legs in baking pan with chopped onion, celery, carrot, thyme, 
peppercorns, chicken stock and bay leaf. Braise at 350 degrees until tender, 
turning often, about 1 hour. Cool. Skin and shred duck flesh. Drain and reserve 
duck fat. Cover pan and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Trim artichokes, leaving 1/4-inch stem. Cut 1/2-inch from top. Cook, covered, 
in boiling salted water until tender. Drain, cool and discard outer leaves. 
Quarter or halve artichokes, depending on size; remove choke. Toss artichokes 
in olive oil and set aside. If using canned artichokes, do not add oil. 
</P>
<P>
Heat about 2 tablespoons reserved duck fat in skillet over medium-low heat. Add 
red and green peppers and sliced onion and saute until tender. Add garlic and 
rosemary. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Heat through. 
</P>
<P>
Mix shredded duck and pepper mixture in large bowl. Add enough duck stock to 
hash to keep moist. Refrigerate (this can be done day before). 
</P>
<P>
Before serving, heat about 2 more tablespoons duck fat in skillet. Add duck 
hash and saute over medium-high heat until crispy and brown. Add artichokes and 
heat through. 
</P>
<P>
Spoon hash on each plate and top with 1 or 2 poached eggs for each serving. 
Ladle Orange Hollandaise over eggs. Garnish each plate with parsley and 3 
orange segments. Serve with toast. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: If there aren't enough duck drippings from baking pan, render some extra 
duck skin from other duck parts on top of the stove. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Hollandaise 
</P>
<P>
1 cup white wine reduced to syrupy consistency 
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
3/4 cup cold butter 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
In bowl over warm water, whip reduced wine, orange zest and juice, lemon zest 
and lemon juice and yolks until very thick. Keeping bowl over heat, add cold 
whole butter to mixture until desired consistency has been achieved. Season to 
taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.

BACK TO BASICS: HOW TO DEAL WITH DUCKS: ROASTING AND CARVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opinions differ on how ducks should be roasted. One school of thinking insists 
the breast meat should be served rare, the legs thoroughly cooked. This method 
requires carving the breast meat while still pink, then returning the legs of 
the bird to the oven to continue roasting or finishing them under a broiler. 
</P>
<P>
Even when ducks are cooked in one continuous step, roasting directions vary for 
different varieties. Some instruct you to place the bird breast-side-down and 
cook it at 425 degrees for 10 minutes. Then you're supposed to turn the bird 
breast-side-up and reduce the temperature to 350 degrees for the remainder of 
roasting. Others recommend a temperature of 325 or 350 degrees for the entire 
roasting period. 
</P>
<P>
If no directions are printed on the package, thaw frozen ducks (in their 
original packaging material) on a tray in the refrigerator. When time is short, 
thaw the birds in a pan of cold water, changing the water frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Remove the thawed bird from the package and take the neck and giblets out of 
the body cavity. Rinse the duck inside and out with cold water and remove any 
pinfeathers that may have been missed when the bird was processed. Pat the duck 
dry with paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
The oil sac at the base of the duck's tail may be cut away, if desired. 
Sprinkle the neck and body cavities with salt and skewer the neck skin to the 
back of the bird. Pierce the skin lightly all over with a fork so excess fat 
will drain more easily. 
</P>
<P>
Although ducks may be stuffed, dressing is often cooked separately to prevent 
it from absorbing the fat released from the bird during roasting. The cavity 
may be rubbed with lemon juice; a cored and peeled apple, carrot, onion, celery 
or potato can be placed inside to enhance flavor. (These vegetables should be 
discarded before serving.) 
</P>
<P>
Place the prepared duck on a rack in a roasting pan. At 350 degrees, roast 
unstuffed duck 20 minutes per pound. Add 20 to 30 minutes to the total roasting 
time if the bird is stuffed. During the first hour or so of roasting, siphon 
off the fat in the bottom of the pan. 
</P>
<P>
Once roasted, the duck should be allowed to stand 20 minutes for the juices to 
set (Step 1). Pierce the bird through the breast with a carving fork to hold it 
steady and cut the skin between the legs and body. The legs may then be pressed 
downward. 
</P>
<P>
Make a horizontal cut just above the wing joint (Step 2) through the breast 
meat to the bone. Remove the wish bone, then cut the meat from the breast in 
thin slices parallel to the rib cage (Step 3). 
</P>
<P>
To remove the legs, tip the bird sideways. Force each leg outward to break the 
joint located under the body, then sever it with the carving knife (Step 4). If 
the legs are still rare, return to the oven or broil, turning frequently, until 
thoroughly cooked. 
</P>
<P>
Ducks up to five pounds may also be halved or quartered, either before or after 
roasting. Place the bird breast-side-down on a cutting board and, using 
scissors or a boning knife, cut from the neck down each side of the backbone 
(Step 5). Lift the backbone out and discard. 
</P>
<P>
Turn the bird breast-side-up and bend the carcass backward until the breastbone 
pops up (Step 6). Pull it out and discard. 
</P>
<P>
Spread the duck flat and cut down the center (Step 7) into halves. To quarter, 
cut each half into two between the thigh and breast (Step 8). One quarter 
should include the leg and thigh, the other the breast and wing.

The best way to describe the Great Chocolate Cover-Up is with the words that 
appear on its two-tone pink label: "A scandalously delicious way to dip fruit, 
cookies, snacks . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
It's a new product from Sara Brook Desserts of Houston: chocolate coating in a 
jar. You soften the coating -- it comes in white and dark chocolate -- in the 
microwave oven and use it straight from the jar to paint fresh fruit, cookies, 
pretzels, dried apricots, nuts and whatever else you can think of. The Cover-Up 
can also serve as an ice cream sauce and as the dessert dip at a fondue party. 
</P>
<P>
The advantage is, you don't have to transfer it to a bowl or pot. That means 
your clean-up load is lessened by at least one bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover-Ups are available at Irvine Ranch Farmers Markets and at Pavilions 
markets in West Hollywood, West Los Angeles and Arcadia. The suggested retail 
price is $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A romantic tin of chocolate-infused cookies could make a splendid Christmas 
gift. In gold trimmed with magenta and black, the container holds 10 ounces of 
Tuscan-style chocolate biscotti. To make sure you know these cookies are for 
dipping, the tin is adorned with an old-fashioned sketch of a child about to 
plunge one into a cup. 
</P>
<P>
Inside are three types of biscotti from La Tempesta Bakery Confections in South 
San Francisco. They are cioccolotti, biscotti dipped in bittersweet chocolate; 
gianduia, hazelnut biscotti covered with milk chocolate mixed with hazelnut 
creme; and amore cioccolato, chocolate biscotti that contain both almonds and 
hazelnuts and are dipped in bittersweet chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggested retail price is $15. Shops that stock the tin include Neiman 
Marcus, Newport; Bristol Farms, South Pasadena; Montana Mercantile and Fred

Another candidate to assuage the craving for chocolate is Green Street 
Restaurant's AFCC. That's the staff code name for the Almost Flourless 
Chocolate Cake, an intense dessert that gives you two pounds of Belgian 
chocolate diluted with only two tablespoons of flour. It's $32 and must be 
ordered a week in advance -- which may try the patience of some chocoholics. 
</P>
<P>
Other Green Street treats available by advance order include a 
chocolate-raspberry cake, $33; a Snicker layer cake, $35; key lime and New York 
cheesecakes for $29 each; and a carrot cake for $35. The restaurant's popular 
zucchini bread is also for sale. The price is $4.25 a loaf or $1 for two 
slices.

CHRISTMAS IN SRI LANKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this island nation, hot curries are what most Sri Lankans eat throughout the 
year. But Christmas is different. That's when roast turkey with stuffing and 
fruit-laden steamed puddings hit the table. 
</P>
<P>
These dishes, accompanied by a salad, vegetables and dinner rolls, appear in 
upper-middle-class homes, whether Christian or not (Sri Lanka is 70% Buddhist). 
</P>
<P>
Turkeys are shipped in from the United States, but the pudding is English in 
origin. The English, Sri Lanka's most recent Colonial rulers, bowed out in 
1948. The Dutch and Portuguese, who preceded them, also added cakes and sweets 
to the national larder. 
</P>
<P>
Shanthi Casie Chetty, the daughter of a Sinhalese mother and father of Dutch 
descent, teaches cooking in Colombo, the capital city. She's studied pastry 
making in Switzerland and regularly gives a course in Western-style desserts. 
Recently, she demonstrated the pudding during a pre-Christmas series of 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
Ceiling fans whirred overhead warding off Colombo's steamy heat as Casie Chetty 
chopped fruits. It didn't seem to matter that Christmas pudding seems more 
suitable to colder climes. With one end of the room open to the breezes, she 
showed how to marinate the fruits in a mixture of brandy, sherry, vanilla, rose 
flavoring and the spices that have drawn traders to the island for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than using pre-ground spices, she lightly roasts cardamom seeds, whole 
cloves, nutmeg and a cinnamon stick in a dry skillet and grinds them into a 
powder. Along with raisins, currants and candied peel, the pudding includes 
cashews, which are another important crop in Sri Lanka, and preserved ginger. 
</P>
<P>
The fruits should marinate four to five days or even longer to enhance the 
flavor. The marinating fruit can be stored at room temperature, and Casie 
Chetty advised her students to stand the container in a pan of water to ward 
off insects -- a precaution that is perhaps unnecessary in countries outside 
the tropics. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to duplicate Casie Chetty's work in Los Angeles, the only seasoning 
that may be hard to find is rose flavoring. The best source for this is Indian 
markets. Preserved ginger means ginger cut into chunks or slices and packed in 
syrup, some of which is added to the pudding. This product is carried in 
Chinese markets. 
</P>
<P>
If possible, the pudding should be mixed and steamed well in advance to allow 
the flavors to mellow, then resteamed before serving. Here is the recipe.

FROM CHRISTMAS PAST, A COLONIAL HOLIDAY FEAST; 
</P>
<P>
TRADITIONS: THERE'S NOTHING AMBIGUOUS ABOUT THIS 18TH-CENTURY-STYLE BUFFET FOR 
ENTERTAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Add old-time elegance to your Christmas entertaining this year with an 
18th-Century-style ambigue. Impressive, yet easy to assemble, this is one of 
the secrets of Colonial entertaining that transformed early American Christmas 
tables into a virtual wonderland of things to eat. 
</P>
<P>
The term ambigue (pronounced AM-bee-gew) is itself a quaint colonial way of 
saying the French service a l'ambigue, which means things served in an 
ambiguous style with no particular order of courses -- in short, a buffet. But 
this buffet was certainly no hodgepodge. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1850s, when the Christmas tree began to appear more and more 
frequently in American homes, the center of attention was not the exchange of 
gifts or cards, a tree or festive evergreen decorations. The emphasis was on 
food. For most Protestant denominations, Christmas was strictly a religious 
holiday and the spiritual aspects took precedence. But after church, homes were 
thrown open to lavish entertaining for family, friends and members of the 
community at large. 
</P>
<P>
This was particularly the case during the period between Second Christmas (Dec. 
26) and Twelfth Night (Jan. 6). In that slower-paced age before instant 
communication by computer or telephone, people went visiting, not to watch 
football games on a neighbor's television, but to see friends and relatives 
personally, face to face, and to touch base with the truly human things that 
counted. This sharing of experience and caring for one another was all brought 
together with food, and here is where the ambigue proved so useful. 
</P>
<P>
In its most formal appearance, an ambigue was laid out generally on a large 
round or oval table set in the middle of the room. That way, people could get 
at it from all sides, and if there was a sparkling chandelier overhead, 
candlelight would be thrown down like warm moonbeams on the grand display of 
food. All the dishes were arranged geometrically in sets of two, four or six. 
If a large platter of cake stood on one end of the table, it would be balanced 
on the other end with a matching platter holding, perhaps, an ample bowl of 
Yuletide punch. 
</P>
<P>
Many dishes were arranged in tiers or on varying levels. Glass stands were 
stacked with frosted fruit, evergreens and dried flowers. Statuary made of 
paste sugar or simple cookie figures were positioned in strategic locations 
within easy reach of the children. And all around the table were plates of the 
most delectable things to eat, such as gingerbreads, macaroons, marzipan 
"fruits" and hard candies called clear toys that were cast in multitudes of 
entertaining shapes and colors. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, empty spaces were left here and there in the arrangement because 
when guests came calling, they were expected to bring a "house gift," something 
to add to the buffet. It could be anything from a steaming quail pie or a 
luscious new sausage ready for slicing to a small plum pudding, a basket of 
Chocolate Apees or even a Gateau de Pommes -- if the plan was to stun the host 
with a culinary tour de force. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty of Gateau de Pommes is that it is inexpensive and as easy to make as 
gelatin, and if you can give it an elaborate shape with a mold, everyone will 
think you studied cookery in Paris. It was quite popular with 19th-Century 
cooks for all of these reasons. Best of all, it makes a stellar table piece 
when set near candles, and guests will need no nudging to get their spoons 
working on the masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you do not need fancy glass or china to make an ambigue successful. 
You can arrange it with whatever sorts of plates and trays you have on hand. 
You can even use clean flower pots to prop up stray serving dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Just make as many of the recipes yourself as you feel comfortable doing; put 
the rest together with things from the market. The important point is that you 
carry through on a theme and make the table appear as inviting as possible. 
Don't worry about the rest. Your effort will show, and your family and friends 
will remember with fondness the special gift you created yourself this 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the 1860 recipe of Mary Hamilton Winebrenner, wife of the Rev. John 
Winebrenner, founder of the Church of God. 
</P>
<P>
GATEAU DE POMMES 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds peeled and cored apples, peels and cores reserved 
</P>
<P>
3 cups water or red currant juice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
3 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
Grated zest of 2 lemons 
</P>
<P>
4 envelopes unflavored gelatin 
</P>
<P>
4 drops oil of cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
Candied citron strips 
</P>
<P>
Slivered blanched almonds 
</P>
<P>
Place apple peels and cores in pan along with water. (Water will produce green 
gateau, red currant juice will produce red gateau.) Cover and simmer 15 
minutes. Strain and reserve 2 1/2 cups liquid. 
</P>
<P>
Chop peeled apples into small pieces and puree in food processor along with 
lemon juice until texture resembles applesauce. Transfer puree to pan and mix 
in sugar and lemon zest. 
</P>
<P>
Soften gelatin with 1/2 cup reserved apple liquid. Add remaining liquid to 
puree. Cook, covered, 15 minutes. Add softened gelatin and boil 2 minutes. 
Remove from heat immediately and add oil of cinnamon. Pour hot apple mixture 
into 2-quart china mold or into several small molds. When cool, cover and 
refrigerate overnight. 
</P>
<P>
When ready to serve, dip mold in warm water and invert onto serving dish. 
Decorate gateau with strips of candied citron. Stick slivered almonds into 
gateau like spines. Makes 10 to 12 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: If oil of cinnamon isn't available, place 2 cinnamon sticks in pan when 
simmering peels and cores. Discard when peels are cooked. 
</P>
<P>
YULETIDE PUNCH 
</P>
<P>
4 pounds sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 quarts water 
</P>
<P>
2 pints pineapple juice 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
1 cup orange juice 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 teaspoons grated orange zest 
</P>
<P>
2 cups white grape juice or dry white wine or light rum 
</P>
<P>
Combine sugar and water in pan and boil 10 minutes. Add pineapple juice and set 
aside to cool. 
</P>
<P>
Add lemon juice and zest, orange juice and zest and grape juice. Transfer 
mixture to ice cream freezer and process according to manufacturer's 
directions, or place in clean metal container, cover and freeze. When frozen, 
beat with whisk (or feed small batches into food processor) to smooth texture 
and pour into punch bowl. Serve immediately. Makes 1 gallon or 15 to 20 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 This recipe comes from the cooking school of Hannah Hungary Widdifield 
(1768-1854), a Philadelphia confectioner.

GINGERBREAD 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
Grated zest of 1 orange 
</P>
<P>
1 3/4 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon ground ginger 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
2 cups fine white cornmeal less 2 1/2 tablespoons 
</P>
<P>
6 eggs 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups molasses 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
Cream together butter, brown sugar and orange zest until light. Sift together 
flour, ginger, cinnamon and baking soda twice, then stir in cornmeal. 
</P>
<P>
Beat eggs in separate bowl until thick and frothy. Stir in molasses and milk. 
Add egg mixture to butter mixture, then gradually sift in dry ingredients. 
(Sift and fold in dry ingredients gently so that batter is kept light.) 
</P>
<P>
Grease 14x8 1/2-inch loaf or 14-inch round baking pan and line bottom with 
greased baking parchment. (Or use 2 (12-cup) muffin pans, allowing 20 to 25 
minutes baking time.) Spread batter evenly over bottom and smooth surface with 
knife. Bake at 350 degrees 35 to 40 minutes. Serve hot or cold. Makes 8 to 12 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Do not forget to remove 2 1/2 tablespoons cornmeal from 2 cups. This will 
compensate for difference between old-style cornmeal and commercial cornmeal of 
today. 
</P>
<P>
PEANUT MACAROONS 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 pounds blanched, unsalted peanuts 
</P>
<P>
6 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
5 egg whites 
</P>
<P>
2 cups superfine sugar 
</P>
<P>
Process peanuts in food processor until they resemble coarse meal. Add flour 
and mix thoroughly. Beat egg whites in separate bowl until very stiff, then 
fold in superfine sugar. Mix together peanut and egg mixtures. 
</P>
<P>
Drop batter in mounds of about 2 teaspoons each on ungreased parchment-covered 
baking sheets. Bake at 250 degrees 40 to 45 minutes, or until light brown. 
Remove macaroons with spatula and cool on racks. Store in airtight containers. 
Makes about 6 dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a rare recipe that even tastes like Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
CHOCOLATE APEES 
</P>

<P>
Cream together butter and sugar until light in bowl. Add cocoa, water and salt 
and beat well. Beat in egg and vanilla. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
WITH THEIR QUIRKY FUSION TUNES AS VITAL AS EVER, THE ERASERHEADS ARE STAGING A 
REUNION.

<P>
Important bands never die. They don't fade away, either. They have reunions. A 
regional case in point: The Eraserheads, the quirky fusion band that swept the 
Santa Barbara music scene a decade ago, drifted apart as the members went in 
different directions. 
</P>
<P>
Where are they now? Kei Akagi moved to Los Angeles in 1983 and quickly moved 
into the upper jazz ranks there, most recently playing with Miles Davis. 
Bassist Steve Nelson, now a fellow Angeleno, works with sound effects by day. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Nass, the Venturan of the bunch, is a resident guitar whiz who, along 
with Nelson, has played with the off-and-on but ever-popular R&amp;B Bombers. 
Drummer Tony Moreno still plays around Santa Barbara, as does trumpeter Jeff 
Elliot, who has lately been working in Les McCann's band. 
</P>
<P>
But fond memories of the 'Heads' heyday stuck and the group has staged a few 
"reunions" in the last two years -- the most recent last Friday night's 
scorching SRO show at Joseppi's. 
</P>
<P>
When it was in full swing (and before four-fifths of the band was hired away by 
Flora and Airto), the Eraserheads were the most happening thing around. 
"Certainly," said keyboardist Akagi "it was the loudest band in town." No 
doubt, the Eraserheads qualify as members of that intelligently intense style, 
which guitarist John Scofield's young daughter calls "loud jazz." 
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon before last week's show, the 'Heads were rehearsing at 
Joseppi's, dredging up the repertoire from the memory banks. Apart from a few 
missed turns, the music coalesced neatly. They ran through "Rodan's Revenge" -- 
despite the title, a lyrical, Latin-tinged piece that toughens as it goes. 
Later, they discussed the order of the solo section for "Ladies of Quebec." 
"We'll sandwich it," said Akagi to Nelson. "You're the bread, we're the meat 
and you're the bread again." 
</P>
<P>
The tunes are still vital after all these years. Have they just become embedded 
in the band's collective memory by now? Sitting at the bar, Nass joked, "We 
just played them until we were brain-dead and then they stayed there." 
</P>
<P>
It all started right across State Street from Joseppi's at the legendary, 
now-defunct Baudelaire's, where drummer Moreno threw together a birthday bash 
11 years ago. At the time, Moreno and Elliot were employed as part of Jimmy 
Messina's jazz-ish band, and Moreno wanted some after-hours diversion. The 
diversion amounted to too much fun. A band -- with an irreverent, irrelevant 
name -- was born. 
</P>
<P>
If the band came as a blissful accident, a distinct band identity soon arose. 
How did they find themselves so quickly? As Elliot explained it: "More than any 
band I've ever been in, it features everybody's talents. It's the maximum of 
being in a band." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was just a chemistry," Nelson said. "It sounds corny, but putting 
these players together made for an instant sound. It was surprising to me the 
way it all worked, because we all had some different backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
As the group solidified into an ongoing entity, Nelson's creative machinery 
began working overtime and his distinctive original material dictated the 
flavor of the band's music. "Anything I wrote," Nelson commented, "I wrote 
specifically for these players. I've tried to do these same songs down in L.A. 
with other guys and it doesn't feel right, so I give up on it." 
</P>
<P>
Another quality unique to the Eraserheads: the mixed crowd. Whether because of 
the built-in humor, the in-your-face energy level or the rock 'n' roll 
attitude, the band's appeal has always been wide-ranging. 
</P>
<P>
"We sucked in a group of people who I don't think had been turned on to fusion 
before," said Nelson. "They were coming out for the music, flailing about on 
the dance floor and listening. When I wrote some of these songs, I was thinking 
about that. 
</P>
<P>
"I come from a pop background and I wanted people to be able to remember 
melodies and be able to dance to it. I wanted people who weren't ordinarily 
into fusion music to be able to come in and appreciate it and not just hear a 
bunch of guys playing fast notes." 
</P>
<P>
Was it also his intention to program humor into the music? "That's because 
there are so many knuckleheads in the band," he said. "You've got to write for 
that." Ah. The knucklehead factor. "It's true. Everytime we do 'Godzilla's 
Holiday,' the whole middle section sounds to me like a Doris Day movie -- music 
by DeVol." 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be a consensus among the players to keep the Eraserheads a 
sometime thing, to be fleetingly "reunited" annually rather than bucking for a 
ongoing project. 
</P>
<P>
"See," says Akagi, "what happened was that we went through a serious period. We 
wanted to do something with the band. We started rehearsing intently and it 
lost some of the edge. Basically, I think the great thing about this band is 
that it's a live band, a playing band. 
</P>
<P>
"If you try to streamline that and put that into a certain format or take some 
of the rough edges off of it, it's just going to lose some of its better 
qualities. That's something we found out. So the reunion format is actually 
working out very nicely." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," adds Nass, "we rehearse for an hour and a half a year and then play the 
tunes. So if we mess things up, we've go a good reason: We never rehearse." 
</P>
<P>
They didn't mess up. Approaching 2 a.m. that night, the 'Heads were still 
blazing. The band laid into "Godzilla's Mardi Gras" one more time before being 
put back on Nelson's shelf. Until 1991, anyway.

The Pixies are coming to Ventura, but Tinker Bell won't be able to make it. 
These Pixies are different than those pixies. No mischievous little elfin 
critters, no daffodils, no daisies, no fairies. These Pixies aren't even cute. 
</P>
<P>
This quartet has little in common with its name. It would be like finding out 
that the New Kids On The Block were really the Dead Kennedys with spiffy new 
haircuts and wardrobes. 
</P>
<P>
The Pixies are this gnarly rock band from Boston. They are about as subtle as a 
car crash in your living room. The band generates enough energy to power the 
Red Sox to the American League East title by 30 games. The most unpixielike 
front man is none other than that hulking brute in the black T-shirt, the one 
and only Black Francis. He sounds like the bad guy in a Prince Valiant movie. 
His real name is Charles Michael Kitridge Thompson IV and he's actually a very 
nice guy. Mom was right, looks can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
The Pixies have been around since 1987, when Black Francis swayed his college 
buddy, Joey Santiago, with the tried-and-true "let's start a band" routine. The 
two guitarists put an ad in a paper, seeking a bass player who liked Husker Du 
and Peter, Paul and Mary. Kim Deal, the only one who answered the ad, got the 
job. Next, she recruited her friend David Lovering to beat on the drums and 
presto, there were Pixies. 
</P>
<P>
Gigging around like other bands was too easy, so the Pixies recorded a demo 
tape and British label 4AD released the eight-song effort as a mini LP. And it 
was a hit. Two albums followed. In 1989, Rolling Stone voted the Pixies as Best 
New Band. "Bossanova," the band's current and third LP, is cruising right along 
on the college/alternative charts. 
</P>
<P>
The band will end its current tour with a Friday night performance at the 
Ventura Theatre. Opening will be Carnival Art and an interesting Santa Barbara 
band with a funny name, This Ascension. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent phone interview from Minneapolis, Black Francis discussed the life 
and times of his band: 
</P>
<P>
How are the tour and the album doing? 
</P>
<P>
The tour's doing all right. We just drove for 15 hours. The roads were closed 
due to snow. It's the usual. We've got this huge semi-truck to carry all our 
stuff, but I don't drive anymore. My driving days are over, but they might come 
back. Who knows? The album's doing all right, not as good yet as our last one, 
"Doolittle." I haven't seen my first big royalty check yet. 
</P>
<P>
Where did you get that name? 
</P>
<P>
My name? I thought Black Francis was a cool-sounding name for a rock star. And 
the Pixies? We found that in the dictionary. It was under P. 
</P>
<P>
How did you get started in the music biz? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I dropped out of college four years ago and started a band. I was an 
anthropology major at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. 
</P>
<P>
Who are some of your musical influences? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I was in Puerto Rico for a year, and the thing that got me into the 
Pixies was this Iggy Pop tape -- that's the only tape I had down there. I also 
like Talking Heads, the Ramones, the Violent Femmes and a lot of the big rock 
bands of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
What current bands do you think are pretty cool? 
</P>
<P>
The Jesus and Mary Chain -- that's about it. Oh yeah, and Dick Dale. 
</P>
<P>
What's the best and worst thing about being a rock star? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I guess the best thing is the limelight and the performing. Plus, the 
money is real good. If I wasn't doing this, I'd probably be back in school. The 
worst thing is laundry. The next time we stop, I have to do my own laundry. 
</P>
<P>
What's the most misunderstood thing about the Pixies? 
</P>
<P>
That we're some sort of intellectual and artsy band, and we're not. All sorts 
of people come to our shows, all ages, plus kids that've just heard the 
records. 
</P>
<P>
What would be your dream gig and your nightmare gig? 
</P>
<P>
Playing with Link Wray would be my dream gig. I don't have a nightmare gig. 
</P>
<P>
Describe Pixies music. 
</P>
<P>
It's crazy rock 'n' roll with a crazy backbeat. I suppose it would be easy to 
sound like somebody else, but we don't. Maybe we're not good enough musicians 
to copy somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
What are the goals of the band? 
</P>
<P>
To get whatever we can get. 
</P>
<P>
Can rock 'n' roll change the world? 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely not. No way.

<P>
My sisters and I used to call it the holiday harangue. With only slight 
variations over the years, it went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
"But Mom, everyone is wearing them." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if every kid on the planet wears them." 
</P>
<P>
"But Mom, it's for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Long pause. "Well, we'll see." 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not our requested clothing item showed up under the tree usually 
depended on three factors: Was it outrageously expensive? Was it practical? Did 
it have any redeeming aesthetic value? 
</P>
<P>
My own kids are still young enough that they only want toys. And mercifully, 
they're still gullible enough to believe that any omission from their Christmas 
list is due to Santa's fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
But I wondered what kind of clothing items other kids across the county were 
asking for this year -- and whether Santa was going to come through. 
</P>
<P>
My niece, a ninth-grader at Sinaloa Junior High in Simi Valley, told me she 
wasn't exactly expecting a Christmas miracle. Just a pair of "black, clunky 
boots" from England and maybe some designer jeans. 
</P>
<P>
And what did Santa think of the requests? "Those boots have got to be the 
ugliest things I've ever seen," her mother said. "There's no way I'm going to 
spend $90 on something even Frankenstein wouldn't wear." 
</P>
<P>
The jeans have a similarly slim chance of making it into a wrapped box. "I'm 
sorry, but I won't spend money on ripped jeans. I have a dog that can do that 
for free." 
</P>
<P>
Cori Smith, co-manager of Contempo Casuals in Simi Valley, is a seasoned 
veteran of the holiday harangue. Mothers and daughters often come into the 
store to shop for Christmas clothing. Their differing opinions, she said, 
frequently provide entertainment for the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some tops that, for all intents and purposes, are sheer, and when the 
mothers see that they look like negligees, they refuse to buy them," Smith 
said. "But they usually cave in at the end. Their kids plead with them so 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Several store owners said that clothing items that encounter less parental 
resistance include currently popular fleece jackets, jeans with leather sewn 
onto them to resemble riding chaps, and oversize blazers. 
</P>
<P>
"From the top up, the girls look really nice with these tailored jackets, and 
from the waist down, it's the gym look, with mid-calf leggings and tennis 
shoes, " said Karen Abel, owner of Wear It Again Sam, a resale clothing store 
across the street from Ventura High School. 
</P>
<P>
Over at the Gap in Thousand Oaks, sales associate Eddie Brown said parents are 
coming in with their kids' lists and shopping for more conservative looks. "A 
lot of kids have asked for overalls. Leggings and oversize shirts are still a 
hot look," he said. "Still, most times if it's for a gift, the parents ask if 
it's returnable." 
</P>
<P>
And what about boys? As expected, store owners said many clothing requests are 
sports-related. But even a simple T-shirt or pair of shorts -- especially if 
they're made by such pricey designers as Quiksilver, Billabong, Stussy or 
Jimmy'Z -- can turn some Santas into grinches. 
</P>
<P>
"Some T-shirts with a mock turtleneck can be $29, and denim shorts can cost 
$44," said Shar Caudill, assistant manager of Surfin' West in Simi Valley. 
"Sometimes a parent will say, 'I'm sorry, but I just don't have that much.' 
Other times they'll break down and say, 'Oh, OK, it's Christmas.' " 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the rare teen-ager like Ventura High School senior Jessica 
Berryhill, who changes the entire holiday shopping equation. 
</P>
<P>
Berryhill, dressed on a recent afternoon in a green polyester-knit sweater from 
the 1960s and carrying a small child's lunch pail as a purse, said she steers 
clear of department stores. Berryhill prefers thrift stores, where she's more 
likely to find the "hippie or beatnik" styles she likes. 
</P>
<P>
How does her mother feel about buying her used clothes for Christmas? 
</P>
<P>
Berryhill smiled. "I think she'd rather not," she said. "I think she'd prefer 
that I wore clothes from places like The Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PREMISE 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County is teeming with the fashionable and not so fashionable. There 
are trend-makers and trend-breakers. There are those with style-personal and 
off the rack-and those making fashion statements better left unsaid. Twice a 
month, we'll be taking a look at fashion in Ventura County-trends, styles and 
ideas-and asking you what you think. If you have a fashion problem, sighting or 
suggestion; if you know a fashion success or a fashion victim, let us know. We 
want to hear from you.

Which of the following would top an adult's least-wanted holiday gift list. 
</P>
<P>
A) Another necktie. 
</P>
<P>
B) A cheap-bottle-of-wine and matching glasses gift set. 
</P>
<P>
C) A purple shawl knitted with grandmotherly love. 
</P>
<P>
D) none of the above. 
</P>
<P>
If you guessed D, you're right. 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously absent from the above list is, of course, that standard around 
holiday time -- the venerable fruitcake. 
</P>
<P>
A popular gift item, yes, but not always a welcome one. Fruitcake receivers can 
often be heard muttering "Ahh, you shouldn't have. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But isn't it the "thought that counts"? We'll leave the answer to people who 
get one each Yule, via a loving relative or unimaginative boss, and end up 
piling the new one on top of last year's -- and the year's before. 
</P>
<P>
But even people who like them often let them stack up. A true fruitcake, it is 
said, should stand the test of time. Commonly mummified in liquor-soaked linen, 
some holiday fruitcakes are then placed in tightly sealed tins and stored for 
what seems an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday fruitcake -- made with just enough batter to bind the fruit -- 
features a sugary assortment of candied fruits and nuts. If candied fruit 
doesn't appeal, look for a fruitcake made with dried ingredients, such as 
apricots, raisins, figs and currants. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with tradition, we'd like to suggest some fresh variations on a 
fruitcake theme, offered at some local bakeries: 
</P>
<P>
* Sweet Cinns, 313 E. High St., Moorpark, is offering a Sour Cream, Cream 
Cheese Coffee Fruitcake made with your choice of fresh strawberries, 
blueberries, raspberries, boysenberries or apples. "We make it year-round," 
owner Peggy McLaughlin said, "but it's a holiday favorite with our customers." 
Sweet Cinns also has a dried fruit "combo cake" with prunes and apricots. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin said traditional fruitcake gets a bad rap. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't even bother to taste it," she said, "they've heard too much bad 
about the stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently she doesn't pay attention to fruitcake bashers. "Personally I like 
it. I'm the only one in my family that does though -- there's 13 of us." 
</P>
<P>
Call 529-7493. 
</P>
<P>
* At Bill Baker's Bakery, 457 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai, owners Colleen and Thomas 
Kohnen prepare a traditional German fruitcake known as stollen (pronounced 
SHTAH-len). 
</P>
<P>
"German Christmas stollen is more of cake than the traditional fruitcake," 
Colleen Kohnen said, "it's not so much of a fruit solid." 
</P>
<P>
Stollen's list of ingredients include raisins, soaked three days in rum, and 
three kinds of nuts: walnuts, pecans and almonds. 
</P>
<P>
"We also use some candied fruit like pineapple and cherries," she said, "but 
very little." 
</P>
<P>
It's best to let your stollen -- dusted on top with powdered sugar -- sit for a 
while before eating, according to the Kohnens. 
</P>
<P>
"It's best if you let it sit for at least two weeks," Colleen Kohnen said. "As 
the rum ferments it gives it a nice strong flavor." 
</P>
<P>
"In Germany this is the most popular holiday food item," Thomas Kohnen said. 
Stollen, yes, but not the American version of fruitcake. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much too sweet and heavy," he said. "Germans would not like it at all." 
</P>
<P>
If you think a relative or friend out of town may like stollen, the Kohnens 
will ship it anywhere for you, Colleen Kohnen said. 
</P>
<P>
Stollen is available in four sizes: 1, 1 1/2, 2 and 3-pound cakes. 
</P>
<P>
Call 646-1558. 
</P>
<P>
* Norbert Viaud features a "light and fluffy" fruitcake at his Raffine Gourmet 
Boutique, 3741 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd., Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
"French fruitcake is shaped like a loaf and contains candied fruits," he said, 
"but not near as much as a traditional American fruitcake." 
</P>
<P>
The French version also calls for pecans and walnuts "and contains a lot of 
eggs and butter -- it's a very fluffy and rich cake," Viaud said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Thomas Kohnen, Viaud considers American fruitcake too sweet and 
over-laden with fruit. "Way, way too heavy," he said, "it's like a piece of 
rock." 
</P>
<P>
If Viaud's fruitcake version sounds appealing, just ask for the cake wrapped 
with decorative golden foil. 
</P>
<P>
Call 496-2699. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SERVING SUGGESTIONMINI FRUITCAKES

marinated fruit and nuts. Spoon into greased miniature muffin tins. Place 
cherry on top of each. 
</P>
<P>

THE REGGAE BEAT; 
</P>
<P>
THAT OH-SO-DANCEABLE BRAND OF VALLEY-STYLE CARIBBEAN MUSIC WILL MAKE ITS WAY 
NORTH FOR A FRIDAY GIG.

<P>
It's as primitive as King Kong's jungle on Skull Island. It's as basic as cops 
and doughnut shops, as basic as boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, 
boy-wants-to-kill- mother-in-law. It's only cerebral if your brains are in your 
feet. It's reggae music -- sort of Deadhead music from the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Reggae has the beat, but it can't tell time because reggae songs seem to last 
for weeks at a time. But your feet don't care -- they know what to do. They 
move. And reggae is everywhere, except on the radio. It's even in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
And just like McDonald's, which everybody has, every town not in Jamaica seems 
to have its own reggae band. Even in the Valley. Ventura, for example, has The 
Lion I's, and Reseda has the cleverly named Urban Dread. 
</P>
<P>
The band plays on Sunday nights in Canoga Park. The locale is pretty urbanly 
dreadful, the bar of a family restaurant in a shopping center on the corner of 
a four-lane street that has a shopping center on the other three corners as 
well. Few people know this, but Valley is actually an old American Indian word 
that means "it's too hot here, and everything looks the same anyway." Sometimes 
you gotta suffer for rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, suffering has a lot to do with Urban Dread's Friday night gig at La 
Casa de la Raza in Santa Barbara. The reggae quartet is doing a benefit show 
for El Rescate, an organization that helps South American refugees. The only 
Friday night suffering that may befall you, the reggae fan, is sore feet from 
too much dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Urban Dread plays often from Orange County to Santa Barbara County -- they know 
about 100 songs, with probably 20 or 30 originals. Jason Bourne, who often sits 
in with the Lion I's, sings, plays sax and keyboards. Calvin Banks, who also 
sings, is the guitarist. Gary Stevenson plays bass and Kris Carpenter beats out 
the rhythm on the drums. In a recent interview at the band's Valley venue, 
Bourne discussed the life and times of Urban Dread: 
</P>
<P>
You guys are Valleys, why reggae? 
</P>
<P>
Reggae is good vibes music. It's world music that crosses all boundaries and is 
played in Third World countries. It's a little blues, a little rap, a little 
hip-hop and a little rock. Reggae is all about positive change, and it deals 
with issues that need to be addressed. Reggae is a reflection of things we care 
about. 
</P>
<P>
How did Urban Dread get started? 
</P>
<P>
My parents were really into music -- they are both professional musicians. A 
few years ago, I saw a couple of reggae shows that really made an impression on 
me, mostly this band called Brave New World. They inspired me to get a band 
going where I could sing and play -- that was close to three years ago. Calvin 
and I write most of the songs, but everyone in the band has an input. No one 
guy is the boss. And after being together for just a month, we started to get 
gigs. Now we play from three to five nights per week, from Orange County to 
Santa Barbara -- and I think we'll be doing some shows in San Luis Obispo soon, 
too. We can play as often as we want. 
</P>
<P>
Who are your musical influences? 
</P>
<P>
Bob Marley, Steel Pulse, Black Uhuru, Shinehead, and we all really like Pato 
Banton. 
</P>
<P>
Describe Urban Dread music. 
</P>
<P>
It's roots music from Jamaica with a customized, urbanized twist to it. We put 
a California accent on reggae music. 
</P>
<P>
What would be your dream gig and your nightmare gig? 
</P>
<P>
Our dream gig would probably be to open for Pato Banton. We don't really have a 
nightmare gig. 
</P>
<P>
Who comes to your shows? 
</P>
<P>
All sorts of people -- all sizes, all colors, all ages. Sometimes, we play 
underage places so kids can come to see us. 
</P>
<P>
What's the lowdown on this benefit for El Rescate? 
</P>
<P>
We try to do at least four concerts per years for free. And El Rescate -- that 
means "the Rescue" -- was something we felt was a very good cause, and we like 
helping people. 
</P>
<P>
Can a reggae band from the Valley get signed? 
</P>
<P>
Well, all we can do is play our hearts out and hope to get signed. We play a 
lot, and right now we're entirely self-sufficient. We're not this real 
hard-core dread reggae band; we just really love the music. We just want to 
pass along the reggae message, which can be very uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
What's the difference in the music scene between L.A. and Santa Barbara? 
</P>
<P>
Reggae is happening more along the coast than it is inland. Maybe that's 
because the beach people are more laid back -- islands, palm trees, the beach, 
all that California stuff. More people attend our shows when we play near the 
beach -- it's harder for us inland.

THEATER REVIEW 'A CHRISTMAS CAROL'; 
</P>
<P>
DICKENS DELIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
IT IS APPARENT FROM THE START THAT THIS IS AN EXCITING VERSION OF THE CLASSIC 
TALE.

The eerie lights go up, the spooky stage smoke clears and what looks like a 
seven-foot-tall ghost of Marley appears wearing stunning fluorescent ghoul 
makeup and cobwebby grave clothes. It's clear that this "Christmas Carol" is 
going to be an exciting blend of spectacle, special effects and surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Local director Tim Glasby has mounted an ambitious version of the Charles 
Dickens classic in the intimate 100-seat Center Stage Theater. The 21-member 
cast, who play 40 characters, is headed by Equity actors John Fink as Marley 
and Richard Stretchberry as Ebenezer Scrooge. 
</P>
<P>
The massive set, based on four rotating wagons, features a curved bridge large 
enough to hold a phalanx of carolers in Victorian dress who sing between 
scenes. We sympathize with the poor Cratchit family, root for Tiny Tim and 
follow the metamorphosis of that archetypal miser Scrooge, who stomps and 
humbugs his way through rapidly shifting scenes -- from Christmas Past, 
Christmas Present and Christmas Future. 
</P>
<P>
The first scenes reveal that Ebenezer was a solitary, neglected child who grew 
up to be a lonely, isolated man, insulated from all human feeling. When 
Christmas Future reveals his unmourned death, Scrooge suffers profound anguish 
over his miserly years and feels a genuine need to make something of what is 
left of his life. 
</P>
<P>
The test of an actor is here. Scrooge must change in one moment from curmudgeon 
to jovial gift-bringer. Stretchberry is up to it. He builds the change slowly 
with superb control. When we finally see him hopping and singing with joy on 
Christmas morning, we can believe this. And we believe that Scrooge is a symbol 
of Everyman and that every man harbors a streak of Scrooge. 
</P>
<P>
This is a good holiday show for the whole family. The children will love the 
special effects. One little girl at the performance I attended turned to her 
friend afterward and said, "It was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the show benefit the Youth Incentive Project of Santa Barbara 
County.

December is filled with the sounds of Christmas carols, bells and chimes, the 
bellowing laughs of jolly men in bright red suits. But one December night 
brings the mysterious rhythms of drums and rattles played by winter night 
spirits dressed in black and white. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara residents have gathered to celebrate the summer solstice, the 
longest day of the year, for the past 14 years. But 6 to 8 p.m. Friday marks 
only the second annual winter solstice festival, celebrating the longest night 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
And although both summer and winter solstice dates are important spiritual 
markers for many cultures, present and past, "the spirits which inspire winter 
solstice are quite different from the spirits which inspire summer solstice," 
said Michelle Bernes, coordinator of the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
So although the highlight of summer solstice is a lighthearted, colorful 
parade, winter solstice offers a mysterious, magical processional. This year's 
theme is magic of the night, and a masked sorceress and sorcerer will conjure 
magical feats, Bernes said. 
</P>
<P>
Revelers are asked to dress in black and white, as they believe a "winter night 
spirit" looks. They should also bring drums and rattles and meet at the gardens 
of the Santa Barbara Courthouse at 6 p.m. Musician Jim De Fazio will lead the 
group in a musical candlelight procession to De La Guerra Plaza, followed by 
celebratory dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Like its summer counterpart, winter solstice is a non-commercial event and 
participants' costumes cannot display any slogans, words or recognizable 
symbols. No animals or motorized vehicles are allowed. Call 964-3727. 
</P>
<P>
What could be a better Christmas gift than a van Gogh? Two van Goghs. Starting 
Christmas day, the Victoria Street Theatre will begin its run of Robert 
Altman's critically acclaimed film "Vincent &amp; Theo," a portrait of the van 
Gogh brothers. Tickets are $6. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Street Theatre is presenting "The Year's Best Fest," featuring the 
best foreign films the theater showed in 1990. "Jesus of Montreal," by 
writer-director Denys Arcand, will conclude its run tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry V" will be shown Friday through Sunday. Written and directed by actor 
Kenneth Branagh, who portrays Henry V, the film was nominated for two Academy 
Awards -- best director and best actor. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for festival movies are specially priced at $4. Call 965-1886. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Horovitz's adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic holiday tale "A 
Christmas Carol: Scrooge and Marley" will end its run Sunday at the Center 
Stage Theatre in the Paseo Nuevo shopping center. Show times are 8 p.m. today, 
Friday and Saturday and 7 p.m. Sunday. Weekend matinees at 2 p.m. Tickets are

<P>
"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" by the Pacific Conservatory of 
Performing Arts ends its run at Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria on Sunday. 
Andrew Lloyd Webber and Kim Rise's musical tells the biblical story of Joseph 
through the use of many genres of music, including rock 'n' roll, 
country-Western and calypso. Show time is 8 p.m. today, Friday and Saturday, 2 
p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Tickets are $8 to $16. Call (800) 221-9469.

IT'S THE SEASON FOR 'MIRACLE ON PIER AVENUE'; 
</P>
<P>
HERMOSA BEACH: CHRISTMAS CHEER HAS SPECIAL MEANING AT THE GEM CAFE, AS A DEC. 
31 EVICTION DATE TURNS INTO A THREE-YEAR LEASE.

Strange, isn't it? Each man's life touches so many other lives. And when he's 
not around, it leaves an awful hole, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Henry Travers to Jimmy Stewart in "It's a Wonderful Life." 
</P>
<P>
This month was to have been the last for the Gem Cafe in Hermosa Beach. The 
Formica countertop and gingham curtains should have been gone by now. The 
landlord had been clear: Henry and Grace Poirier were being evicted Dec. 31, 
along with the neighborhood diner they have run for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
But December can be a wonderful month, as the Poiriers can attest. Because when 
word of the eviction got out, it occurred to the Gem's customers that if 
Hermosa Beach no longer had Henry's small talk and Grace's homemade pies -- 
well, it would leave an awful hole, now, wouldn't it? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle on Pier Avenue," exulted Willis Hayes, who, with a group of 
other regulars, rallied around the elderly Poiriers to save the venerable cafe 
just in time for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"Yep!" chimed in 65-year-old Henry Poirier from behind the horseshoe-shaped 
counter. "There is a Santa Claus." 
</P>
<P>
After months of legal wrangling and moral appeals to the landlords, the 
Poiriers this week signed a three-year lease on the property. 
</P>
<P>
The fight to save the Gem dates back to May, when the eviction notice arrived 
in the mail. The landlords, film producer Warren Miller and his wife, Laurie, 
said it was regrettable, but the Poiriers had no lease and a prospective tenant 
willing to pay more than double the Poiriers' rent had approached them about 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
To the Poiriers, it meant the loss of a retirement nest egg they had counted 
on, and the end of the cafe they had bought in 1962 from two sisters who had 
run it since 1949. Henry Poirier said he and Miller had had a "gentleman's 
agreement" about the $475-a-month rent, which the Poiriers had paid in cash 
every month since 1964, when Miller bought the building in which the cafe is 
located. 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, Poirier said, he and his wife had been asking the Millers 
for a lease. They were growing older, they explained, and without a lease, they 
could not sell the restaurant and retire. 
</P>
<P>
But the landlords refused. In an interview in June, Laurie Miller said it was 
too late. She said the Poiriers had been offered a lease several years ago when 
she began handling the property for her husband. They had turned it down, and 
communication had been bad since then, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, she said at the time, when a prospective tenant approached her in 
April, she leased the space out from under the Poiriers. 
</P>
<P>
Stunned, the Poiriers prepared to shut down the little cafe. Then the customers 
learned of their predicament. A Save the Gem Cafe committee was formed, headed 
by a group of local residents. Hayes, a local real estate agent, offered to buy 
the building. Max Wright, a Hermosa Beach actor best known for his role as the 
father on the NBC sitcom, "ALF," called the newspapers to publicize the 
Poiriers' plight. Richard McCurdy, a local entrepreneur, enlisted two attorney 
friends, who took the case for free and managed to win a reprieve of several 
months for the Gem. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Poiriers were under notice to leave by Dec. 31. Then, depending on 
whose view you take, fate or the threat of litigation stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
The prospective tenant -- a woman who had planned to open a "trendy California 
cuisine-type restaurant" -- lost interest in the property, said the Millers' 
lawyer, Harry Hathaway. The Save the Gem committee said she may have been 
frightened away by the threats and counter-threats being exchanged by lawyers 
on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Hathaway said, without the prospective new tenant in the picture, 
the Millers had a change of heart, and "they all started talking again." 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't have been right, with such a long-term relationship, not to have 
given Henry the opportunity," Hathaway said. 
</P>
<P>
And so it was that this week, the Millers and the Poiriers signed a new, 
three-year lease on the property. The rent is higher, but the Poiriers will now 
be able to sell the restaurant and retire comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Poirier said he hopes the buyers will be "a nice young couple I can train 
and teach everything I know." 
</P>
<P>
The Millers had no comment. But a Dec. 3 letter to the Poiriers conveyed their 
sentiment: 
</P>
<P>
"Henry," wrote Warren Miller, "I hope this puts all the misunderstanding behind 
you, so you can continue to cook instead of worry."

TORRANCE NOMINATES ADVISER FOR OIL REFINERY; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: THE COUNCIL SELECTS A NONPROFIT RESEARCH FIRM AS ITS CHOICE TO BE 
SAFETY ADVISER AT MOBIL'S REFINERY. MOBIL HAS CHOSEN ANOTHER FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance City Council members on Tuesday selected a nonprofit research firm 
from Menlo Park as their nominee for safety adviser at Mobil Oil's Torrance 
refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Describing SRI International as "clearly the best" out of an original field of 
30 candidates, council members said they were impressed by the firm's 
experience analyzing safety in the petrochemical field and in a number of other 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
The safety adviser position is a major component in the October pretrial 
settlement of a public nuisance lawsuit Torrance filed against Mobil in 1989. 
Under the terms of the agreement, the adviser will analyze safety at the 
refinery, make recommendations to improve safety measures and oversee the 
phasing out or modification of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil, however, has chosen another nominee for the position, and 
representatives of the company and the city will now try to work out a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tim Mock cast the only vote against SRI's selection, saying he 
wanted further details about a safety audit the firm conducted recently for an 
unnamed oil refinery. SRI's contract for that audit prevents the consultant 
from revealing who the client was or where the refinery is located. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson said city officials know only that the client was 
not Mobil Oil. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's discussion of the safety adviser candidates took place 
behind closed doors, but the 6-1 vote was taken in public. State open-meeting 
laws prevented council members from conducting private interviews of the 
candidates, and council members said they did not want to conduct such 
interviews in public. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, a committee of city officials -- including the city manager, city 
attorney, fire chief, fire marshal and outside legal counsel -- screened the 
consultants. SRI was their unanimous recommendation from a list of four 
finalists, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil informed the city last month that its nominee for the position is 
Westinghouse's Energy Systems Business Unit, which is primarily involved in the 
design and service of commercial nuclear power plants but which also provides 
risk assessment for the nuclear and petrochemical industries. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil's Torrance refinery manager, Joel Maness, said Mobil is withholding 
judgment on SRI. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to say much at this point because I'm not at all familiar 
with SRI," Maness said. "We'll interview them and see what kind of experience 
and expertise they can bring to the role and then I'm sure we'll have more to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
City officials, who had until Wednesday to notify Mobil of their nominee, now 
must meet with Mobil representatives to try to work out a compromise on which 
consultant ultimately will serve as safety adviser. 
</P>
<P>
If the two sides cannot agree -- which Nelson said is likely to be the case -- 
the decision will be made by retired Superior Court Judge Harry V. Peetris, who 
is overseeing the consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said compromise negotiations will not begin until the second week in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Council members criticized Westinghouse as having little experience with 
refinery audits. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these organizations can go out and get you the expertise you want, 
but when somebody already has the experience, that's better than having someone 
else go out and put together a team for you," Councilman Bill Applegate said. 
"We feel that SRI is the best firm available to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said the city will remain open-minded during compromise discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"When we sit down (to talk), we may hear about experience that Westinghouse has 
had that we did not know about," he said. "Westinghouse is very, very good. I 
think SRI is a whole lot better." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1946 as Stanford Research Institute, an arm of Stanford University, 
SRI gained prominence for its pioneering research in radar and laser technology 
for the U.S. Defense Department after the Korean War. The firm became 
completely independent of Stanford in 1970, said Dennis Maxwell, vice president 
for corporate marketing and communications. 
</P>
<P>
Now one of the largest nonprofit research firms in the United States, SRI 
employs more than 3,500 people in laboratories ranging from Princeton to 
Australia. At least 2,000 workers are employed at the company's headquarters in 
Menlo Park near Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"We do everything from pharmaceutical research . . . to policy work for 
economic competitiveness of states and countries to health care cost 
containment to physical sciences work and engineering work," Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
If selected to be safety adviser, SRI would view the project as a cross between 
health and safety consultation and environmental risk assessment, said William 
Ralston, manager of environmental business programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary objective of the consent decree is to protect the health and 
safety of both employees and the local residents," Ralston said. "We have 
worked for companies in the past who have asked us to do similar types of 
reviews of their facilities, really with the same objectives in mind. . . . 
This is right up our alley."

By early this week, the Salvation Army in Torrance had filled two garages with 
canned food donated by individuals, businesses and service organizations, 
including Epson America, Del Amo Fashion Center, Kiwanis and Rotary clubs, 
local schools and Scouting and YMCA groups. 
</P>
<P>
The food, collected by city workers, will be distributed to about 150 needy 
families before Christmas Day. Other South Bay groups are helping the needy 
this holiday season. Among them are students at Peninsula Heritage School, who 
collected canned food, toys and candy for the "Feed My People" program at 
Rolling Hills Covenant Church, and the Sandpipers, a philanthropic organization 
that expects to assist 43 families, including 131 children, with donations of 
food, toys, clothes and money.

3 PENINSULA HIGH SCHOOLS INFEASIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest about the closing of two Palos Verdes Peninsula high 
schools (Times, Dec. 6) and can readily sympathize with the students affected. 
However, their parents are well aware it is not economically feasible to have 
three PV high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Since most if not all parents have a high income to live on that hill, I 
respectfully suggest (half in jest) that if these parents desire to maintain 
the status quo, they donate to a high school trust fund to keep the three high 
schools operating. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, I assume most of these highly educated parents are explaining 
the economic "facts of life" to their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
Many South Bay school districts have encountered similar dollar problems and 
somehow have managed to survive and are doing fine. Hopefully, the PV school 
district will be similarly successful.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RECYCLING FOR CHRISTMAS TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes residents who want to have their Christmas trees recycled 
into mulch can bring the undecorated trees (no tinsel and no flocked trees) to 
City Hall from Dec. 28 through Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
They should put the trees into a marked bin at the City Hall parking lot at 
30940 Hawthorne Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the mulch will be used in public areas of the city. Residents who want 
some for their own yards should call the city Public Works Department at 
541-6500. Residents who choose not to recycle can leave their Christmas trees 
at curbside.

STOP THE BUILDING, PRESERVE COASTLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are proposals currently under consideration for the building of two 
500-room hotels on the coastline of Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know how or when it began, but it seems to me that there's a crazy kind 
of race going on, to crowd ourselves out of existence, or at least, out of 
peaceful existence. There's this frantic effort to make sure no piece of ground 
is vacant. Wherever there's a vacant lot, there's a rush to build something on 
it, something that will bring money and a whole lot of people, and more cars 
and smoke and noise. 
</P>
<P>
I just don't get it -- it would seem logical that we'd all be trying 
desperately to hold on to what little bit of nature is left -- and especially 
our seashore. But I get the feeling that I'm in the overwhelming minority on 
this, and that I'm losing the fight -- losing to the "Big Three" -- greed, 
ignorance and apathy. 
</P>
<P>
When all the land along the coast has been built on, will these money-mad 
developers come up with a way to build giant hotels and shopping malls on the 
ocean itself? Don't they wonder about these things when they're sitting in a 
sea of stop-and-go traffic on Hawthorne Boulevard, breathing exhaust fumes and 
going nowhere? Don't any of them have grandchildren, and don't they want to 
preserve some of this earth and ocean and air for them? Am I all alone in this? 
Why should I have to persuade my City Council to keep what we've got left the 
way it is? 
</P>
<P>
Is there something I'm missing here? Are there those among us who like crowds, 
and smog, and noise, and traffic, and concrete buildings everywhere there's 
room to build one? Maybe these are the people who drive diesel cars and foul up 
my air, because they think they're going to save $26 a year, and the hell with 
me? 
</P>
<P>
Look -- those of us who are lucky enough to live in one of the few remaining 
areas with a little natural beauty should be doing everything we can to ensure 
that it stays this way -- we owe it to our grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The money we leave them won't mean much if they can't get to the ocean or even 
see it, let alone swim in it. 
</P>
<P>
Enough already with this craziness -- with the building, building, building. No 
hotels!

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CLERK KILLS GUNMAN IN LIQUOR STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oakland man who ran into an Inglewood liquor store Monday afternoon to 
reload his revolver during a gun battle outside the shop was shot to death by 
the store's clerk after he pointed the gun at the clerk, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil began when Charles Westbrook, 25, of Oakland, emerged from a 
Century Boulevard motel and began randomly firing a .44 Magnum into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Two unidentified men objected to the gunfire and after a heated argument, one 
of them shot Westbrook's friend, Vernon Dunbar, 25, of Oakland, in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
Westbrook, Dunbar and another friend fled across the street to Mr. B's Liquor 
Mart at 10025 S. Prairie Ave., where the injured Dunbar pleaded with the clerk 
to call paramedics. The clerk spotted Westbrook in the doorway with a gun and, 
believing him to be the man who shot Dunbar, demanded that he drop it, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Westbrook turned his gun on the clerk, who fired his own weapon from behind the 
counter, killing Westbrook, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunbar was in stable condition Wednesday at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical 
Center with a bullet wound to the chest. The gunman who shot Dunbar was still 
at large, police said. No charges have been filed in the killing, which is 
under investigation.

BRUINS WINNING IN WAVES; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: MACLEAN SCORES 23 POINTS IN 18 MINUTES AS TEAM IMPROVES RECORD TO 8-0 
WITH 108-85 ROMP OVER PEPPERDINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Jim Harrick said this week that he wanted his fifth-ranked UCLA 
basketball team to be more "coldblooded," taking out its victims without 
compassion and then moving on to the next. 
</P>
<P>
"(Bill) Walton's teams were like that, about as coldblooded as any I've ever 
seen," Harrick said. "They just killed people -- didn't care who it was. There 
was never any major drop-off in their level of play." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick got what he wanted Wednesday night at Pauley Pavilion, where the Bruins 
buried Pepperdine, 108-85, before 7,881. 
</P>
<P>
Junior forward Don MacLean scored 23 points, moving past Sidney Wicks into 10th 
place on UCLA's all-time scoring list, as the Bruins improved to 8-0 going into 
Saturday night's game against Iowa (8-1) at Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a hip that was so sore that he didn't practice this week, MacLean made 
10 of 14 shots. This was after Harrick feared that his leading scorer might 
have a hip pointer suffered during a tumble last Saturday against DePaul. 
</P>
<P>
He played a career-low 18 minutes as the Bruins cruised. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve forward Keith Owens scored a career-high 17 points and had eight 
rebounds and three blocked shots in 20 minutes, Darrick Martin had 15 points 
and nine assists in 23 minutes, Tracy Murray had 15 points in 21 minutes and 
reserve guard Shon Tarver had 14 points in 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins took control during a 19-minute blitz, outscoring the outmanned 
Waves, 62-29, from about the six-minute mark in the first half to about the 
five-minute mark in the second to open a 34-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
They made 62.5% of their shots in building a 57-35 halftime lead, then made 
53.1% in the second half to finish at 57.8%, a little above their average of 
57.2%, which ranks second in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean said Harrick's words had an effect on the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a game that, obviously, we should win," he said, "but there are 
always upsets in college basketball and if we come out here and we're joking 
around and having a good time because we know we're better, we can get upset. 
</P>
<P>
"But if we're coldblooded, we're going out there with a purpose and blowing 
them out early. We let some teams hang with us and a couple of teams even beat 
us last year when we should have won. I don't think we're going to let that 
happen this year." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't against Pepperdine, which has lost three of its past four games to 
fall to 5-4 under Coach Tom Asbury, Harrick's former assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Geoff Lear led the Waves with 24 points. Freshman Dana Jones, last 
season's City 3-A player of the year at North Hollywood High, scored 19 points 
and guard Doug Christie scored 17. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick coached for nine seasons at Pepperdine, where his teams won or shared 
five conference championships, reached the NCAA tournament four times and the 
National Invitation Tournament twice. This was his first time coaching against 
the Waves, who hadn't played UCLA since the 1986-87 season. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick said this week that he would like to play the Waves every season, but 
that's probably not going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't be fair to the other teams in the area," said Jim Milhorn, an 
associate athletic director who makes the Bruins' schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine kept it close for about six minutes, or until Harrick brought his 
reserve power off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
With Owens, Tarver and Zan Mason on the floor in place of MacLean, Gerald 
Madkins and Mitchell Butler, and with Rodney Zimmerman later replacing Murray, 
the Bruins outscored the Waves, 10-0, to open a 26-15 lead. 
</P>
<P>
They continued to pull away, extending their lead to 78-44 about five minutes 
into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time it was 16-15, I thought we picked up our intensity defensively 
and went on a spell," Harrick said. "We played awfully well until about six 
minutes into the second half, and then we kind of quit." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, by then, the outcome had long been settled. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a young team," said Asbury, whose starting lineup included a pair of 
freshmen, "but we're getting older and older as we go through the schedule. 
UCLA has a fine, fine basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Jim Harrick believes that officials erred in UCLA's favor Saturday 
at Rosemont, Ill., when they reset the 45-second clock after Tracy Murray's 
shot was deflected by DePaul's Stephen Howard with about 10 seconds left. The 
ball kicked out to Darrick Martin, who was fouled as he attempted to shoot with 
4.6 seconds left. That was more than 47 seconds after the Bruins took 
possession of the ball. Under a new NCAA rule, the shot clock is not reset if a 
blocked shot is deflected out of bounds by a defensive player. However, if a 
shot is blocked and remains inbounds, the clock is reset when a team gains 
control. Martin made two free throws to give UCLA a 92-90 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Former Bruin All-American Bill Walton, who tutored Louisiana State's 7-1 
Shaquille O'Neal for several days last month at LSU, started working Wednesday 
with UCLA's Mike Lanier and Rodney Zimmerman. "I imagine we'll do it on a 
regular basis through the course of the season," said Walton, who is working as 
a commentator for Prime Ticket. "I love it. Basketball is the favorite aspect 
of my life. I love working with these guys." . . . Zimmerman had five points, 
three rebounds, six blocked shots and two steals in 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
For the record: DePaul's David Booth missed his last three shots against UCLA. 
He scored a career-high 40 points, but didn't score in the last six minutes.

MORNING BRIEFING: IN BASEBALL, LOYALTY IS DOUBLE-EDGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Smizik of the Pittsburgh Press responded to the chorus of "whatever 
happened to loyalty?" that followed baseball's recent round of lucrative 
free-agent signings -- notably former Pittsburgh first baseman Sid Bream's move 
to the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Smizik posed a quiz: 
</P>
<P>
"Other than being former Pirates, what do the players -- some of the best and 
some of the most popular in the team's history -- listed in the following 
paragraph have in common? 
</P>
<P>
"Bert Blyleven, Ken Brett, Smoky Burgess, John Candelaria, Wilber Cooper, Mike 
Easler, Dock Ellis, ElRoy Face, Bob Friend, Phil Garner, Dave Giusti, Frank 
Gustine, Dick Groat, Harvey Haddix, Don Hoak, Ralph Kiner, Bill Madlock, Jim 
Morrison, Al Oliver, Tony Pena, Johnny Ray, Rick Reuschel, Jerry Reuss, Rick 
Rhoden, Bill Robinson, Don Robinson, Manny Sanguillen, Dick Stuart, Kent 
Tekulve, Arky Vaughan, Lloyd Waner, Richie Zisk. 
</P>
<P>
"They all have been traded away by the Pirates." 
</P>
<P>
Add Pirates: Bob Hertzel of the Pittsburgh Press asked Pirate center fielder 
Andy Van Slyke about Carmelo Martinez, Bream's backup. 
</P>
<P>
Said Van Slyke: "I hope Martinez can lose 20 pounds before spring training. He 
and Oprah are on the same diet." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the first National Hockey League goalie to wear a mask? 
</P>
<P>
WAC'd out: Sport magazine has this thing about the Holiday Bowl, college 
football's version of pinball with unlimited play. In its October issue, Sport 
called the Holiday the best annual bowl. 
</P>
<P>
In its January 1991 issue, Sport ranks "The 10 Best College Bowl Games of the 
Last 10 Years," calling Miami's 31-30 victory over Nebraska in the 1984 Orange 
Bowl No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
But the Holiday Bowl hogs the rankings, occupying Nos. 2, 6 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
Add Holiday Bowl: The magazine raves over: 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 -- Brigham Young's 46-45 victory over Southern Methodist in 1980. Jim 
McMahon threw a 41-yard touchdown pass with 18 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 -- Penn State's 50-39 victory over BYU in 1989. The Nittany Lions, ahead 
41-39, blunted Ty Detmer's comeback heroics by running back an intercepted 
two-point conversion attempt, then stripping Detmer of the ball and running it 
53 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
No. 8 -- BYU's 24-17 victory over Michigan in 1984. Robbie Bosco was injured in 
the first half but gamely threw a touchdown pass with 1:23 to play in a victory 
that gave the Cougars the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Jacques Plante of the Montreal Canadiens, in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Buffalo Bills' backup quarterback Frank Reich, who has thrown only 
28 passes this season but will start in place of injured Jim Kelly against 
Miami Sunday, when asked whether he will be prepared for the Bills' chance to 
clinch the AFC East: "I think so because . . . because I have to." TED BROCK

<TEXT>
<P>
John Robinson-and-the-Rams is beginning to sound like Pat Riley-and-the-Lakers 
and you know how that turned out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Agent Leigh Steinberg is getting calls from clients about another kind of 
draft. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Many of them are concerned about the armed services draft being reinstated 
because of the Middle East crisis," Steinberg said. "Actually, a lot of players 
could pass NFL team physicals, but not U.S. Army physicals. And some would be 
too big for the height and weight limitations." . . . 
</P>
<P>
A client of Steinberg who is having his best season, Warren Moon, is in line to 
receive a bonus from the Houston Oilers that would exceed $1 million. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Moon is second behind injured Jim Kelly in the NFL quarterback ratings. If he 
finishes in the top three or the Oilers reach the Super Bowl, he will be paid 
the average salary of the three-highest paid quarterbacks -- Joe Montana, 
Randall Cunningham and Kelly. That average is $3.25 million. Moon is working on 
a five-year, $10-million contract. . . . 
</P>
<P>
After throwing for 527 yards against Kansas City and missing Norm Van 
Brocklin's NFL record by only 27 yards, Moon told Steinberg: "With this 
offense, don't worry. We'll get the record sooner or later." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look for a large number of juniors to opt for the NFL draft because a 
collective bargaining agreement could be reached before the 1992 season and 
lower the salary of rookies. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Six-foot-eight Dan McGwire's stock would rise even more if the NFL eliminated 
the in-the-grasp rule. . . . 
</P>
<P>
When Sam Jankovich moves from the University of Miami to New England, he will 
discover that the Hurricanes recruit a lot better than the Patriots. . . . 
</P>
<P>
With Phil Simms down, Giant Coach Bill Parcells has run out of excuses for not 
opening up his offense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You may remember new Angel TV announcer Ken Wilson from his ESPN days. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Two of USC's four Heisman Trophy winners, Mike Garrett and Charles White, are 
working for the university. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Garrett replaces former NFL defensive back Mike Reinfeldt, who has become chief 
financial officer for the Green Bay Packers after building a solid reputation 
in the Trojan and Raider business departments. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I assume Augusta will wear green warmup jackets before taking on USC at the 
Sports Arena Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, four of the six safeties voted into the Pro 
Bowl game are from USC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Brett Salisbury should prove to be a worthy successor to quarterback Bill 
Musgrave at Oregon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Ben Johnson's former coach, Charlie Francis, says Johnson is in 10.0, 100-meter 
shape. Johnson, who will run half that distance in the Sunkist meet Jan. 18 at 
the Sports Arena, was clocked at 9.79 at Seoul. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey fans boo every time a Toronto goal shows up on the out-of-town 
scoreboard at the Meadowlands because the Devils have the Maple Leafs' first 
draft pick in the year of Eric Lindros. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I still can't fully enjoy Indiana basketball telecasts from Bloomington because 
of the terrible camera angles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
News item: LSU's Shaquille O'Neal scores 53 points against Arkansas State. 
Reaction: He might be good enough to score 53 against Arkansas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
John Thompson loves to relax by playing the slot machines, which is one reason 
why he's bringing Georgetown to Las Vegas to face Ohio State Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
At crunch time, the New York Knicks go only to Patrick Ewing. Most good teams 
rely on at least two players, including a small forward. . . . The Clippers are 
the only established NBA team with a losing record against the last four 
expansion franchises. They are 10-11 against Minnesota, Orlando, Charlotte and 
Miami. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Denis Potvin, Larry Robinson and Paul Coffey may have more assists, but don't 
even suggest that Bobby Orr isn't the greatest offensive defenseman ever to 
play hockey. . . . Sugar Ray Leonard, who challenges World Boxing Council 
junior-middleweight champion Terry Norris Feb. 9 at Madison Square Garden, got 
knocked down in a sparring session the other day. Usually, that doesn't mean 
much, but the same thing happened to Mike Tyson before he was flattened by 
Buster Douglas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best shootout -- and rebounding duel -- in Texas is Akeem Olajuwon vs. David 
Robinson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
During Mike Dunleavy's slow start with the Lakers, owner Jerry Buss dropped 
into the coach's office and offered his encouragement. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The short list of prospective National League expansion franchises will never 
be short enough for me.

Top-ranked Minnesota and fourth-ranked Boston College, which played in the 1990 
NCAA quarterfinals, meet today at 4:30 p.m. in the Great Western Freeze-Out 
Intercollegiate Hockey Tournament at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Defending tournament champion Michigan State plays Toronto in the second game 
at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel will broadcast both first-round games and the title game Friday 
at 7:30 p.m. A crowd of about 6,500 is expected. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most NCAA hockey teams, the rosters of the Golden Gophers and the Eagles 
are composed entirely of Americans. This season, the Gophers of the Western 
Collegiate Hockey Assn. have an all-Minnesota lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Under sixth-year Coach Doug Woog, Minnesota (14-1-3) has made four Final Four 
appearances in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Boston College (10-4) has 18 lettermen from a team that was eliminated in the 
NCAA semifinals by eventual champion Wisconsin. Coach Len Ceglarski is college 
hockey's winningest coach at 642-313-35. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State (8-8-4) is off to its worst start since 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our team is a little better than our record," Coach Ron Mason said. 
"The biggest thing for us -- we have a lot of outstanding players -- is 
determining roles." 
</P>
<P>
Three Michigan State players are National Hockey League first-round draft 
picks: goaltender Jason Muzzatti (Calgary), Michael Stewart (New York Rangers) 
and Bryan Smolinski (Boston). 
</P>
<P>
Toronto (10-9), in its 100th season of hockey, hasn't played since Dec. 2 
because of exams. Coach Paul Titanic played for Mason at Bowling Green in the 
late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Spartans beat Alberta, 7-4, in the title game and British 
Columbia defeated Denver, 6-3, in the consolation game.

MAPLE LEAFS, ING HALT RANGERS, 4-1 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are better ways to break into the National Hockey League than as a 
goaltender for the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ing, 21, is learning the lesson, but he is also giving the team with the 
worst record some solid netminding. 
</P>
<P>
With Aaron Broten scoring two goals, the Maple Leafs, behind Ing, beat the New 
York Rangers, 4-1, Wednesday night at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Ing stopped 19 shots, losing his shutout when Ray Sheppherd scored on a power 
play with 2:37 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
It was a reversal from Ing's first appearance against the Patrick Division 
leaders. On Oct. 22, he gave up five goals in 45 minutes before being replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has lost 14 games, Ing has won seven of the nine games Toronto has 
won. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the Rangers' second home loss in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
Broten was acquired by Toronto from Quebec on Nov. 17. "All you can do is go 
out and do your best," he said. "You play for pride. I did that at Quebec and 
now I'm doing it again. Hopefully, with people like Ing, we will improve." 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 1, Montreal 1 -- It was a moral victory for the Nordiques. After beating 
the Canadiens Tuesday night at home, they came right back to get a tie at 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Canadiens outshot Quebec, 35-22, there was only 5:18 left when 
Shayne Corson scored their only goal. It spoiled goalie Ron Tugnutt's bid for 
his first shutout in his 96th NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 16,832 jeered as the Canadiens, one of the worst teams on the power 
play, blew all six of their opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, Washington 2 -- Dirk Graham scored a short-handed goal with 4:25 
left at Chicago to give the Blackhawks the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Graham's backhander from seven feet out enabled the Blackhawks to reach 50 
points before any other team. With a 24-11-2 record, the Blackhawks lead the 
Norris Division by six points. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks took control in the last period. For the first 14 minutes, the 
Capitals had only one shot on goal. Ed Belfour stopped 16 shots for his 22nd 
win. DAN HAFNER

Royals Go Gulfing: Soldiers in Saudi Arabia may have wanted to see Brooke 
Shields, but will have to settle for Prince Charles, who will be jetting in

Women's Work: The Saudi kingdom's newly named guardian of virtue said Saudi 
women are neglecting their families even though cheap foreign labor has freed 
them from the burdens of a job and housework. "The woman here does not do any 
of her duties," said Abdul Aziz Bin Abdul Rahman Al-Said, the general president 
of the Organization for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. Al-Said 
was not in office last month when women protested rules that allow only men to 
drive. They took the wheels in a 40-car caravan through the capital.

Holiday Spirit?: Greenland says rival countries are grabbing too much of the 
Christmas trade and enough is enough. The island is building in Nuuk, the 
capital, a $2-million Santa Claus complex with Eskimo arts and sleigh-rides. A 
chilly mood is in the air because Sweden, Norway and Finland have their own 
major Father Christmas industries.

Wasp's Sting: D.C. is buzzing about former George Bush speech writer Richard 
Brookhiser's new tongue-in-cheek book, "The Way of the Wasp," which offers a 
list of likes of the maligned majority: the "white Anglo-Saxon Protestant" 
sandwich -- turkey roll on white bread; worst WASP sins -- debt and losing your 
temper. Do WASPs eat bagels, pizza and egg rolls? Of course, says Brookhiser, 
but only with a knife and fork.

ART BUCHWALD: GIFTS THAT KEEP ON BEING GIVEN

Klepto was sitting on his front stoop. "I'm waiting for the mailman," he told 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"You must be expecting an important letter." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm actually on the lookout for Christmas packages. The more I get, the 
happier I'll be." 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us feel that way," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"The gifts are not for myself -- they are for other people." 
</P>
<P>
I looked confused. 
</P>
<P>
He explained, "As you know, we're having a conservative holiday and are being 
frugal. So Ruth and I came up with this idea. Instead of buying any new gifts, 
we'll just pass along the ones that are sent to us, minus the card, of course." 
</P>
<P>
"But if you give away everything you receive, you won't have anything for 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter. Most of the presents we get aren't anything to write home 
about. Look at this Ratatouille Popcorn in a can. Many folks couldn't do 
without it, but we can. Believe it or not, Ruth and I have spent eight or nine 
Christmases without Ratatouille Popcorn." 
</P>
<P>
"What will you do with it?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'll send it to my brother-in-law, Toady. He mailed us a pound of goat's 
cheese last year which, I am certain, his boss gave him. We've been very lucky 
this December. The Rapps sent us a letter-opener, which we immediately passed 
on to the Ludwigs after they mailed us a Christmas washcloth." 
</P>
<P>
"Who got the washcloth?" 
</P>
<P>
"We can't decide. We still haven't received a gift from the Lyons or the 
Porters." 
</P>
<P>
"The system is great as long as you don't get the presents mixed up," I said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"We did that last year. The Constantines gave us garden shears. By mistake we 
sent the shears back with our card attached. Damned if we didn't get a rave 
note from Fitzi Constantine saying that they were the most beautiful garden 
shears she had ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
"That must have made you feel good," I told him. 
</P>
<P>
"Sending other people's gifts for Christmas isn't as cheap as you might think. 
There is the cost of wrapping paper, ribbon and postage." 
</P>
<P>
"Why can't you use the same wrapping paper that it came in?" 
</P>
<P>
"That would be cheating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Suppose you pass along a gift to someone, and that person doesn't send you 
one?" 
</P>
<P>
"You mean like you?" 
</P>
<P>
"OK, like me." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't keep score. You can still hold on to the cactus plant from Mary Ellen 
Clarkin with no questions asked." 
</P>
<P>
"If I mail something to you, Klepto, can I designate the person I want you to 
send it to?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, because you may not know what he or she likes -- and when it comes to 
gift-passing, the most important thing is to do it with love." 
</P>
<P>
"You certainly have taken the Grinch out of Christmas," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone has to support the economy."

MAJOR ICE RINK URGED; SOME COOL TO PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former city official has proposed a plan to build a center for competitive 
ice skating on undeveloped city land near the Glendale Freeway, drawing the ire 
of some residents who live near the site. 
</P>
<P>
The facility, which would occupy up to five acres in one of the city's four 
"freeway parks" in the San Rafael Hills off Fern Lane, was proposed to the 
city's Parks, Recreation and Community Services Commission last week by 
Marilyne Wiechmann, a former parking commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Wiechmann, an amateur competitive skater, told commissioners that the proposed 
center would include a stadium with as many as 5,000 seats, a child-care center 
and a cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's recommendation ordinarily is sought, but not required, before 
such a proposal goes before the City Council. Commissioners are expected to 
consider Wiechmann's idea in January, said Nello Iacono, director of the city 
Parks, Recreation and Community Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
Under Wiechmann's plan, the city would lease the undeveloped land for free to a 
nonprofit group that would oversee operations at the rink. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several regional skating and hockey groups interested in 
developing the facility and experienced in organizing competitive events 
attended last week's meeting to support Wiechmann's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The groups, including the California Amateur Hockey Assn. and the Los Angeles 
Figure-Skating Club, have not formally organized into a nonprofit organization 
that would run the center. But they have consulted with a New York-based 
company that builds and designs rinks, Wiechmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said they hoped that the city would then obtain a low-interest loan 
to develop the facility and allow the group to repay it with revenues and 
private donations. 
</P>
<P>
Construction could cost between $2 million for a single rink and $15 million 
for two rinks and a multiuse stadium, Wiechmann said. She and other organizers 
said they believe the facility eventually would be self-sufficient and that its 
revenues would exceed its costs. 
</P>
<P>
Wiechmann said the center could host international skating competitions, 
provide recreation for children whose Glendale schools begin year-round classes 
in 1991 and help curtail the rapid depletion of local ice skating rinks. Of the 
dozen rinks in Southern California, only three are large enough for competitive 
or team skating, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it means just a simple ice rink with one sheet of ice, we're willing to do 
that," Wiechmann said. "The city, I think, could greatly benefit." 
</P>
<P>
About 10 residents of Fern Lane, the only street leading in or out of the 
proposed site, urged the commission to reject Wiechmann's idea, saying they 
feared traffic and noise in their neighborhood would increase substantially. 
They also said they doubted that the center would be successful. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners did not discuss the proposal, but Iacono said he is skeptical 
about Wiechmann's financing plan. If the city allowed free, long-term use of 
its land, he said, it should not also assume a multimillion-dollar loan debt to 
help organizers. 
</P>
<P>
The city already has plans to build two parks, three soccer and two baseball 
fields, and picnic and barbecue facilities at its "freeway parks" sites, which 
consist of 77 acres of 392 acquired by the city from Caltrans after the freeway 
was completed in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The commission can make recommendations to the City Council on whether a 
recreational facility such as Wiechmann's should be built on the parkland. But 
final approval rests with the council.

BUILDER GETS OK TO PARE DOWN SIZE OF HOUSING PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: TO THE DISMAY OF HOMEOWNERS, A COUNCIL MEMBER CHANGES HER MIND AND 
SAYS KEN DOTY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SUBMIT A NEW ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW ON HIS 
PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council appeared Tuesday to have cleared the way for 
developer Ken Doty to submit new plans for a controversial subdivision in 
Glenoaks Canyon before new hillside building guidelines are adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 to allow Doty to scale down his plan to build 25 
million-dollar houses on 30 acres off Sleepy Hollow Place and submit an 
alternative proposal before the city toughens its development regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The council also indicated that it will overturn its Dec. 4 decision to reject 
the environmental impact report for Doty's 25-house proposal. That could save 
the developer six months to a year in processing an alternative plan, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Glenoaks Canyon homeowners, who have battled with Doty for more than a year 
over his Sleepy Hollow plan, expressed dismay at the action. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real surprise," said Joe Bridges, vice president of the Glenoaks 
Canyon Homeowners Assn. "I'm disappointed in their decision to change the vote. 
I thought Doty had ample time to consider a smaller subdivision and had refused 
to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Doty's plan was one of four proposed projects exempted from an 18-month ban on 
hillside development passed in March so officials could develop new rules 
covering grading, ridgeline preservation and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
The council, after a late-night public hearing Dec. 4, voted 3 to 2 to reject 
the 25-house proposal and to not certify its environmental review. Members said 
they wanted to see fewer houses and less environmental damage in the canyon. 
They also said the review did not include all reasonable alternatives as 
required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
The decision effectively stopped Doty from filing a new plan before the 
hillside building ban is lifted in October, after tougher regulations are 
adopted. It required him to do a new environmental review, which can take a 
year or more, City Atty. Scott Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg, who with Mayor Larry Zarian and Councilman 
Carl Raggio earlier had defeated Doty's plan, this week changed her mind. 
</P>
<P>
She directed city staff members to prepare documents that will allow the 
council to certify Doty's original environmental review. The council next week 
is expected to schedule public hearings in January before formally 
reconsidering the report. 
</P>
<P>
Bremberg and Councilmen Jerold Milner and Richard Jutras are expected to 
approve the review. Zarian and Raggio have indicated that they will again vote 
to reject it. 
</P>
<P>
Bremberg said she changed her position because she did not realize that she 
could reject the 25-house tract but approve the environmental report. She said 
she still opposes any proposal that will affect the canyon's ridgeline but 
believes that the original report will accommodate an alternative plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that other alternatives can be presented in the framework of the 
environmental report," Bremberg said. "I don't see the point of keeping this 
thing going for another two years. Let's get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
The council's vote Tuesday to extend Doty's exemption from the ban will apply 
only to Doty's project and not to the three others in the hillside development 
pipeline. Howard has said making an exception for only one developer would 
leave the city on shaky legal ground. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Doty told council members that his plans could be scaled down but 
refused to say by how much. Doty had maintained for more than a year that any 
subdivision smaller than 25 houses would be financially unfeasible.

LA CANADA'S LOYAL FLOAT-MAKERS INTEND TO REIGN IN ROSE PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Industry is banned in the upscale residential community of La Canada 
Flintridge. Yet a "cottage industry" with hundreds of workers thrives 
year-round. 
</P>
<P>
The workers are all volunteers. In fact, most pay for the privilege of 
participating. And they produce but a single product each year: a comical float 
with moving figures that on New Year's Day travels the 5.5-mile route of 
Pasadena's Tournament of Roses Parade, telecast to millions of viewers around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 volunteers contribute 50,000 hours of work and up to $60,000 in 
cash to produce a flower-laden contraption that whirs, hums and changes form. 
Usually, their work receives only seconds of exposure on television. 
</P>
<P>
But the annual ritual of designing, engineering, building and decorating a 
parade float has become a tradition in La Canada Flintridge, where volunteers 
are feverishly working on their 13th entry. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a common goal," said Sharlyn French, president of the La Canada 
Flintridge Tournament of Roses Assn. "That is to get this sucker built, down 
the parade route and bring home a trophy." 
</P>
<P>
French said the task takes "13 months a year." The contest for the design of 
next year's float begins even before this year's entry starts down Colorado 
Boulevard. Last year, more than 75 ideas were submitted, many by professional 
artists, cartoonists and graphic designers who live in the community. 
</P>
<P>
"The dedication of this community is rather unique when you realize that such a 
variety of people -- a doctor, a dentist, a couple of engineers, a teacher, 
businessmen, two housewives who love to weld -- are some of the people who make 
up the workers on the float construction," said Gloria Winkley, director of 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada's entry is one of only six floats in the upcoming 60-float parade 
that will have been built by amateurs. The community's workers have brought 
home trophies for eight of their 12 entries, including the Founder's Trophy 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The community has gained a reputation for extensive use of moving figures on 
its floats -- La Canada's is one of only a few that are fully animated during 
post-parade viewing. Engineers from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena 
have worked on all of the floats, including last year's entry, entitled "Sheer 
Harmony." 
</P>
<P>
The float depicted four animals -- a tiger, giraffe, ostrich and hippopotamus 
-- harmonizing on barbershop quartet tunes. Meanwhile, a snake wrapped around a 
spinning barbershop pole tried to cut the single hair of a pink elephant. Palm 
trees swaying in an exotic jungle garden completed the colorful entry. 
</P>
<P>
That float won La Canada an award in September from the Tournament of Roses as 
Builder of the Year for Self-Built Floats. 
</P>
<P>
"Our bylaws state that the float must be humorous and must be animated," French 
said. People are not permitted to ride on it because it would be difficult to 
select from among the many volunteers who work on the float. 
</P>
<P>
It takes a driver, a co-pilot and an observer to maneuver La Canada's float 
along the route. Powered by a 1978 Oldsmobile engine converted to run on 
propane, the chassis is controlled with a simple hydraulic gearbox. It travels 
from 2.5 m.p.h (parade speed) to 7.5 m.p.h. -- top speed for the two-hour trek 
from La Canada to the parade formation area. 
</P>
<P>
All of the moving parts are powered by hydraulics and controlled using an old 
computer, said Bob Neilson, who is in charge of this year's decorations. He is 
a retired engineer who grows oranges in Central California when he isn't 
working on the float. 
</P>
<P>
The community's entry this year is entitled "Bearly Balanced," and features a 
playful bear carrying a slingshot in his jeans pocket and riding a 
teeter-totter with other animals, including a frog. The frog kicks its legs to 
send the teeter up to its 21.5-foot height. The heads of the animals turn from 
side to side, and their bodies lean to keep their balance on the teeter. 
</P>
<P>
The teeter is constructed of two pieces of 1- by 10-inch channel steel that are 
hinged in the middle to allow the float to pass under utility and television 
cable wires that obstruct the route from the construction site to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
French, an office manager who gave up her job to oversee the float project this 
year, said construction activity "has reached hysterical time" as volunteer 
welders, shapers and painters give form to the model. 
</P>
<P>
The float association is building the float at the rear of property owned by 
the Valley Water Co., 4524 Hampton Road. There, a donated trailer serves as 
headquarters, and a truck trailer is neatly stocked with an assortment of nuts, 
bolts and other equipment. A steel roof shelters workers, and there is a 
telephone and portable toilet. The standard garb of tattered jeans and sweat 
shirts worn by weekend crews belies their professional status. 
</P>
<P>
The float will be moved Wednesday to a nearby paved parking lot beneath the 
Foothill Freeway for the final week of construction. More than $20,000 worth of 
flowers -- including orchids, roses, nerine lilies, artichokes and kale -- will 
be carefully stored in a donated refrigerated van until they are ready to be 
glued into place. 
</P>
<P>
Two shifts daily of up to 120 people each are assigned to complete the float 
during the final week. Lunches and dinners for the hordes are supplied by local 
restaurants and service organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Children anxiously await their 13th birthday when they are first permitted to 
join in the final madcap fun, French said. She got started when the older of 
her two teen-age boys reached decorating age. 
</P>
<P>
After the parade, French said workers "take two weeks off to become 
reacquainted with our families." 
</P>
<P>
"Then we trash the thing and start over," she said.

EX-SUSPECT IN MOLEST CASE SUES PRIEST; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: FORMER YOUTH MINISTER WHOSE SEX TRIALS ENDED IN HUNG JURIES SAYS 
PRIVATE REMARKS TO AN EPISCOPAL PRIEST SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN TAPED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former youth minister whose three trials for molesting a teen-age boy ended 
in hung juries has sued an Episcopal priest who tape-recorded a confession 
allegedly concerning the sexual allegations. 
</P>
<P>
David Rickard, 40, former youth pastor at St. Jude's Church in Burbank, claims 
in the lawsuit that the church's rector, Father Michael T. Flynn, violated 
Rickard's privacy and the confidentiality of confession. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks that the tape be turned over to Rickard, of Sierra Madre, or 
taken by the court. Also named in the suit, filed Nov. 28 in Burbank Superior 
Court, are St. Jude's and the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 6, Judge Thomas J. Murphy sealed the court record and ordered all those 
involved in the case not to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Confession is a church rite under which a person admits wrongdoing to a priest 
for the purpose of forgiveness. Such conversations are protected under 
California law, as are conversations between doctors and patients or attorneys 
and clients. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard has denied engaging in a sexual relationship but admitted feelings of 
attraction for the youth. He said Flynn urged him to confess, then misconstrued 
his words. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, 50, rector at St. Jude's for nine years, declined to comment. Canon 
Bruce MacPherson, a spokesman for the diocese, said that he was unfamiliar with 
details of the case but that tape-recording a confession does not violate 
church policy. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard was tried in 1989 in Redding and in 1989 and 1990 in Pasadena Superior 
Court on 120 charges of oral copulation with a 15-year-old boy who was in 
Rickard's Bible study class. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, now 20 and married, spent time with Rickard in Sierra Madre and 
later, with his parents' permission, moved with Rickard to Northern California 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The parents learned of the alleged sexual relationship in 1987 and notified 
authorities. Charges were dismissed this year in both places after the third 
jury deadlocked in Pasadena in August. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn wrote Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert de Carteret on Nov. 20 about the tape, 
saying it "was probably not admissible in a court of law, but it will be held 
secure for other use should Mr. Rickard's future behavior require its 
utilization." 
</P>
<P>
De Carteret at first said Rickard may have waived his right to confidentiality 
by filing the suit. But he said later that the gag order prevents further 
action by prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rodiger, vice chancellor of the diocese and an attorney, said the diocese 
and the bishop will probably have little role in the lawsuit because Episcopal 
churches are independently run. Each church elects its own clergy, Rodiger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodiger said the lawsuit could center on the legal difference between a 
"confession" and a "conversation." A similar case about 10 years ago in 
Northern California made such a distinction, he said. A woman convicted of 
stealing church money sued her priest, who had reported the theft because he 
interpreted her admission to him as a conversation. She lost. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. Rickard has said previously that he 
spent more than $90,000 defending himself.

SUIT OVER POLICE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city filed a $5-million lawsuit Monday against Kitchell CEM Inc. and Vanir 
Construction Management Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The two firms oversaw construction of the new $23.5-million police building, 
which was estimated to cost $17 million. The building was completed in June. 
The lawsuit blames the overruns on mismanagement by the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
The city hired construction litigation attorney Kenneth C. Gibbs of Gibbs, 
Giden, Locher &amp; Fleming to handle the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the construction firms could not be reached for comment.

MANAGEMENT PLANS AT 2 SCHOOLS GIVEN OK; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SOME CHANGES HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED. ON ONE CAMPUS, STUDENTS ARE 
SEPARATED BY GRADE LEVELS TO CREATE SMALLER, MORE PERSONALIZED ENVIRONMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles school district officials this week adopted management plans for 
two Northeast-area schools that were drawn up by committees of teachers, 
parents, students and others under the district's shared-management program. 
</P>
<P>
Irving Junior High School in Glassell Park and Arroyo Seco Alternative Magnet 
School in Highland Park were among 13 schools whose proposals were approved by 
the district board Monday. 
</P>
<P>
School-based management was adopted last year during contract negotiations 
between the district and the teachers union, United Teachers-Los Angeles. Under 
it, all schools were empowered to elect administrators, teachers, parents, 
students and residents to management committees with the authority to make 
decisions about school operations. 
</P>
<P>
Those committees were authorized to draw up management plans, which must be 
approved by the district and the union before a campus is fully engaged in the 
shared-management program. Committees, however, were able to make some changes 
before the plans were approved -- provided the adjustments did not clash with 
district or state policies. 
</P>
<P>
Irving's proposal included several changes already carried out at the school. 
In September, students were separated on campus by grade levels to create 
smaller, more personalized environments, said Al Powell, a teacher and UTLA 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
All grade levels lunch together, but ninth-graders attend class in the school's 
bungalows, eighth-graders study in a new campus building and seventh-graders 
use classrooms in the main building, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the schedule has been shortened and classes such as cartooning, sign 
language and archery were added at the end of the day. The subjects are 
intended to stimulate student interest and enhance relationships between 
students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
At Arroyo Seco, which serves students in kindergarten through ninth grade, some 
decisions were made jointly before the district adopted the shared-management 
program. For example, a committee of parents, teachers and students has been 
interviewing administrators and teachers for hire, and a similar council 
advises the principal about curriculum and budgets, teacher Brian Metzger said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials submitted a shared-management proposal to codify and enhance 
their policies, Metzger said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Arroyo Seco's proposal, school officials will conduct a "needs 
assessment" by surveying parents and other neighborhood residents about their 
concerns. Teams of parents and teachers will be established to research 
progressive curriculum programs and teaching techniques, and help implement 
them, Metzger said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Irving, Arroyo Seco already has changed its schedule to allow students to 
take special-interest classes during a final period four days a week. On the 
fifth day, students are released 40 minutes early to give teachers a common 
planning period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, it's not so much a radical departure from what we've been doing," he 
said. "It's a chance to redefine and re-energize our program." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin High School in Highland Park also submitted a proposal, but was asked 
by district staff to clarify several requests and resubmit them in January, 
said teacher Linda Tubach, the school's UTLA representative. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin officials want to link attendance to grades by withholding credit when 
students miss too many classes and do not make up the work. They plan to expand 
an interdisciplinary program in which teachers collaborate on subjects, such as 
American literature and American history. 
</P>
<P>
They will also propose alternative school-day schedules, such as one that 
allows teachers to teach longer classes with fewer students, Tubach said. 
Teachers have not yet agreed on a specific schedule, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The board's decision brings to 40 the number of schools fully engaged in the 
program. The first 27, approved earlier this year, include Marshall High School 
between Los Feliz and Silver Lake and Allesandro Elementary in Elysian Valley, 
said Andy Cazares, the district's director of school-based management.

ALCOHOL PERMIT REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday turned down a request for an alcohol sales permit 
from a drive-through dairy located 600 feet from an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Bob's Dairy had been granted the permit by the city's Planning Commission, but 
that decision was appealed by the Monrovia School District, which opposed the 
permit because the dairy, at 448 W. Foothill Blvd., is in the neighborhood of 
Mayflower Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Mary Wilcox said she could not in good conscience approve the 
alcohol permit so close to a school. The council voted 4 to 1 to deny the 
permit, with Mayor Robert Bartlett dissenting.

NARANJO MAY QUIT PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Anthony Naranjo said he has tentatively decided to step down as 
chairman of the city's Drug and Gang Task Force and as City Council liaison 
with the Police Department, following a shouting match this week with another 
councilman over Naranjo's police record. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Stephen Alexander on Monday proposed an ordinance that would prevent 
anyone convicted of impersonating a police officer -- or of any misdemeanor or 
felony -- from participating in police ride-alongs, an integral part of the 
liaison job. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Naranjo, working as a bail bond investigator, was arrested in West 
Covina for impersonating a police officer. He later pleaded no contest and was 
fined $150 and given six months' summary probation. He publicly disclosed his 
record during his 1988 City Council campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Naranjo said Tuesday his decision is not final: "I have received many phone 
calls from the community urging me to stay. I'll make my decision by the end of 
the week."

<P>
G. John Parker, fire chief in Peoria, Ill., for three years, has been offered 
the job of chief of the Pomona Fire Department by City Administrator Julio 
Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
Parker would be the first black in memory to head a Pomona public safety 
department, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes said Parker, 48, must pass a physical examination, agree to a 
compensation package and be confirmed by the City Council. The council has 
interviewed him and is expected to act Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department has been without a permanent chief since Tom Fee resigned 
in July after 76 of the department's 119 firefighters petitioned for his 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes described Parker as very bright and said he has a reputation as a 
strong leader and good communicator. 
</P>
<P>
Parker joined the Peoria Fire Department when he was 23, after serving in the 
Marine Corps. Parker said he lived in California as a Marine and had always 
planned to move back. "I like the climate. I like the style of living," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Peoria is geographically larger than Pomona, but slightly smaller in 
population. The fire departments are of similar size. 
</P>
<P>
Parker is married and has five children, the youngest 15.

VIEWS CLARIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your Dec. 6 article entitled "City Again Considers Staging a Comeback for 
Historic Theater" misrepresented the position of The Glendale Historical 
Society (TGHS). 
</P>
<P>
TGHS leaders were not "miffed" by the mayor's formation of a task force. There 
is general agreement in the city that a task force should be formed to work 
with a professional consultant to design, develop and implement the Alex 
project. The Alex Theatre Revitalization Project, a TGHS committee, was ready 
to form the task force, but would have done so only with the cooperation of the 
city. When the mayor decided to form the task force, TGHS was pleased and 
viewed the action as a positive sign that the city was ready to move forward on 
the Alex project. TGHS wholeheartedly supports the city task force and has 
enthusiastically accepted an invitation to serve on it. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the makeup of the task force, TGHS and the city do not disagree. Had 
the Alex Theatre Revitalization Project formed the task force, it would have 
been a community-based group including representatives from City Council, 
Glendale Redevelopment Agency staff, Historic Preservation Commission, TGHS, 
Glendale business groups, performing arts professionals, local arts groups and 
at-large business and community leadership -- the very groups the mayor has 
suggested. The fact that the Alex Theatre Revitalization Project believes some 
representatives from these groups should have expertise related to the 
performing arts and/or theater restoration is not in conflict with the mayor's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Alex Extravaganza, presented by The Glendale Historical Society's Alex 
Theatre Revitalization Project, demonstrated wide community support for the 
preservation of the Alex Theatre. We urge all interested citizens, 
organizations and the press to focus on the community's common goal of 
preserving the Alex. Perceiving differences of opinion about how this goal 
should be accomplished as "an undercurrent of controversy" works against our 
common goal and the ultimate success of the project.

DISHES FROM SOUTHERN MEXICO CONTRIBUTE TO AN UNUSUAL, DELICIOUS DINING

At first glance, the Rosarito Beach Cafe might be taken for just another 
Mexican diner. Its street-front window, lit up in bright orange neon, and its 
fairly plain decor do nothing to dispel this initial impression. But then I 
looked at the menu and realized there wasn't a single combination plate to be 
found. Another clue: no complimentary chips. When I spotted the description of 
the Bahia shrimp with coconut milk, chiles and hearts of palm, I began to 
revise my idea about the place for the better. 
</P>
<P>
The first bite of the first dish I ordered, however -- a crab taco appetizer 
plate -- almost made me change my mind again. Despite some good guacamole and 
cucumber, the crab tasted like shredded paper towels. Then my dinner companion 
slid her salad across to me with a grimace. I thought it was all over. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't. The orange-chile dressing may not have been to her taste, but I 
loved it. It was sort of a Thousand Island dressing spiked with orange juice 
and the subtle hint of garlic and chile. 
</P>
<P>
From that moment, Rosarito Beach only got better and better. Many of the dishes 
on the menu come from southern Mexico, and some have a definite Caribbean 
influence. The chicken with chile-nut sauce, for instance; it came with 
plantains and a sauce full of wonderfully pungent spices. 
</P>
<P>
Swordfish Yucatan turned out to be a perfectly grilled fish lightly coated with 
a blend of achiote chiles, citrus juices and spices. Yellowtail Veracruzana was 
a big chunk of tender fish covered with tomato sauce shot through with green 
olives and capers. Carne asada had a spiced citrus marinade pounded into it and 
came with papaya salsa. The chicken mole had one of those terrifically complex 
sauces -- some of the ingredients were honey, chiles, plantains, ground almonds 
and tomato. 
</P>
<P>
The entrees come with fabulous rice and beans -- the kind that make you want to 
eat them every day. For dessert, there's key lime pie, exceedingly sweet and 
exceedingly sour. Pumpkin flan was a cross-cultural treat that mixed the best 
of two great traditional desserts. 
</P>
<P>
There may be no free chips for munching and you may not get that enchilada-taco 
combo platter you expect from most Mexican places, but for my money, Rosarito 
is marvelous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
Rosarito Beach Cafe, 256 Main St., Ventura; (805) 653-7343. Open for dinner

$500,000 ALLOCATED FOR PLANNING REVITALIZATION OF THE ALEX THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than a decade of discussion, the Glendale Redevelopment Agency on 
Tuesday allocated $500,000 toward planning for preservation of the historic 
Alex Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The funds -- the first to be spent specifically for the theater project in the 
downtown redevelopment zone -- are described as "seed money" for revitalization 
of the Alex Theatre. The project could cost as much as $15 million, according 
to earlier estimates. 
</P>
<P>
A portion of the $500,000 could be used to purchase the famed Lanterman Theater 
organ from La Canada Flintridge and move it to the Alex Theatre, said Jeanne 
Armstrong, Glendale redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also unanimously authorized formation of an Alex Theatre 
Revitalization Task Force, a 15-member committee of community representatives 
to be appointed early next month by Mayor Larry Zarian. The committee will be 
charged with developing goals for use of the theater and plans to achieve them. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the City Council, who also serve as the agency, had backed off from 
discussing the Alex Theatre several years ago because the city does not expect 
to have the money for a major revitalization project before the late 1990s. 
They said Tuesday, however, that the availability of the organ, as well as a 
groundswell of community support for the theater, prompted the early action. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the pieces are weaving together," Councilman Carl Raggio said. "Before, 
it was just wishful thinking." 
</P>
<P>
The La Canada Flintridge City Council agreed in September to sell the rare 1926 
Wurlitzer pipe organ given to the city in 1987 from the estate of the late 
Assemblyman Frank Lanterman. The Alex Theatre originally had an organ of its 
own and Lanterman had played it on opening night in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
A week after La Canada's decision, the Glendale Historical Society put on a 
fund-raising, Broadway-style show at the Alex that drew widespread support from 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the city's interest in the Alex Theatre was renewed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada officials last month tentatively accepted Glendale's offer to buy the 
organ for $50,000. Details of the sale agreement are expected to be completed 
within a few weeks, Glendale City Manager Dave Ramsay said. 
</P>
<P>
The action this week will allow Glendale to fulfill its offer. But the cost of 
relocating and renovating the instrument, one of only four of its kind 
remaining in the world, is estimated at up to $500,000 and that money will have 
to come from other sources, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Zarian, who is seeking reelection to the council next spring, has 
made revitalization of the Alex Theatre and acquisition of the organ top 
priorities. He said strong financial support from the business community is 
vital to the success of the project.

TIMES HONORS TOP COACH, LINEMAN, BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After his football team lost its season opener to Rosemead, 30-7, in September, 
said Coach Tony Zane of Baldwin Park High, his biggest concern was not how many 
games the Braves would win. 
</P>
<P>
It was whether they would win any games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Zane and the Braves, the prospects improved considerably after 
the loss to Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin Park wound up finishing the regular season on a roll, going 7-1-1 the 
rest of the way and losing only to undefeated Sierra League champion Nogales. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves made even more strides in the CIF Division IV playoffs, upsetting 
previously undefeated Canyon Springs and Santa Margarita on the way to their 
first berth in a Southern Section championship game since they reached the 
Southeastern Conference final in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In the title game, Baldwin Park suffered a 10-6 defeat to Arlington, but it was 
still a remarkable season for the Braves -- the only 11-man team in the San 
Gabriel Valley to reach the Southern Section finals. 
</P>
<P>
So it should come as little surprise that Zane has been honored as the Los 
Angeles Times Coach of the Year in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
In his third year as coach of the Braves, Zane guided his squad to a 10-3-1 
record. He also improved his overall record to 23-10-2. 
</P>
<P>
Zane had been offensive coordinator at Baldwin Park for 17 years under longtime 
Coach Ty Pagone. When Pagone retired after the 1987 season, Zane was named his 
successor and has followed in the school's winning tradition. 
</P>
<P>
At The Times' high school football awards breakfast last Sunday at the Anaheim 
Hilton &amp; Towers, Zane was honored along with two athletes. Sedrick Thomas 
of Muir was named Back of the Year and Jason Patterson of Bishop Amat Lineman 
of the Year. All received trophies provided by the Los Angeles Times Fund. 
</P>
<P>
It would be difficult to find two players in the valley this season who 
displayed more versatility than Thomas and Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 210-pound Thomas distinguished himself as a passer and rusher and 
also handled punting chores for the Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
A senior, Thomas made his biggest impression as a passer, completing 87 of 132 
passes -- an outstanding 65.9% -- for 1,991 yards and 19 touchdowns, with only 
five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas also took advantage of his 4.5-second speed in the 40-yard dash to rush 
for 740 yards and four touchdowns. He averaged 38.6 yards per kick as the 
team's punter after spending his junior season as a starter at linebacker and 
part-time starter at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
A two-time All-Pacific League selection who led the Mustangs to an 8-4 record 
and the Division II quarterfinals, Thomas is regarded as one of the top college 
prospects in the valley. His recruiting list includes NCAA Division I programs 
such as Colorado, USC, UCLA, UC Berkeley, Oklahoma and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson has not received nearly as much attention from Division I schools, 
but he was every bit as important to the fortunes of Bishop Amat, which won its 
sixth consecutive Angelus League title en route to a 9-2 record and a spot in 
the Division I quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Also a 6-0, 210-pound senior, Patterson was crucial to Bishop Amat's success on 
offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
As a defensive end and linebacker, Patterson paced the valley in quarterback 
sacks with 18. He led the team with 18 blocked passes and also caused two 
fumbles, recovered two others and posted 45 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson was also one of the team's most consistent players on offense. At 
fullback, he rushed for 761 yards and 10 touchdowns in 134 carries and caught 
22 passes for 307 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson was named the most valuable player of the powerful Angelus League, 
where he made the all-league first team two years in a row.

CAL POLY POMONA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM TO PLAY HAYWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal Poly Pomona women's basketball team, which has struggled early this 
season after reaching the NCAA Division II Final Four and finishing third last 
season, will try to reach .500 when it plays host to Cal State Hayward in a 
nonconference game at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Poly Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, ranked No. 2 in Division II in a preseason poll, entered the week 4-5. 
The Broncos suffered back-to-back losses last week, losing in overtime to Cal 
State Stanislaus, 69-61, and Division I opponent Fresno State, 76-67. 
</P>
<P>
Hayward, which plays in the Northern California Athletic Conference, entered 
the week 5-1. It will be the last game of 1990 for the Broncos, who will be 
idle until they visit San Diego State on Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona's fortunes expect to improve when 6-2 center Danielle Carter returns for 
the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. season in January. Carter, a freshman 
All-American selection last season, is on maternity leave. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Broncos have been led by the play of senior guard/forward 
Stephanie Coons, who is averaging 14.1 points and 7.8 rebounds. Two other top 
players are sophomore forward Tami Chick, who averages 11.4 points and 6.6 
rebounds, and senior guard Serenda Valdez, who is averaging 10.6 points. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore defender Chris Stempson, who helped the Azusa Pacific men's soccer 
team reach the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 playoffs 
semifinals for the first time in eight years, has been named to the NAIA 
All-American second team. 
</P>
<P>
Stempson is the first Azusa Pacific player to be selected to an NAIA 
All-American team since Valmir Fernandes was chosen to the second team in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Although his strength was his defensive play, Stempson also scored two goals 
and tied for the team lead with five assists. 
</P>
<P>
"With the skills he has from playing midfield in high school, he has not only 
the ability to defend but to create offensively out of the (backfield)," Coach 
Don Lawrence said. "That was one of the keys to our success this year." 
</P>
<P>
The Azusa Pacific men's basketball team will face one of the top programs in 
the NCAA Division II when it plays host to Cal State Bakersfield at 7:30 p.m. 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific entered the week at 6-4 and Bakersfield is 4-3. Bakersfield, 
ranked in the Division II top 10 in a preseason poll, finished second in the 
division last season. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield won the last meeting between the teams in 1986. The Roadrunners are 
led by junior guard Fred Eckles, who averages 13.6 points and 4.6 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa has been sparked by senior forward Matt Burns, who averages 17.1 points 
and 6.1 rebounds and scored the game-winning basket in his team's 64-62 victory 
over Pomona-Pitzer last week. 
</P>
<P>
Three women's soccer players from Cal Poly Pomona have been named to the 1990 
NCAA Division II All-West Region team selected by the coaches' association. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore forward Shannon Payne made the first team, senior midfielder Kristin 
Harkins the second team and senior defender Julie Huante received honorable 
mention. 
</P>
<P>
Payne, a former standout at Muir High, established single-season and 
career-scoring marks at Pomona with 22 goals and 50 points last season.

VIDEO DISCOVERIES: HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS MARATHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT MARSH, Robert Marsh is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the advent of video, my friends and I have gathered in an annual 
endurance test of holiday cheer. We have thrown Christmas Movie Marathons. 
</P>
<P>
After raiding a video store or two, we sit back for 24 hours or so, basking in 
the season. Some people may want to split their viewing over several weeknights 
or even a few weekends, but those who manage to sit straight through everything 
will find it a wonderful sensation. As the films flicker by, the marathoner may 
feel his or her heart grow to two or three times its normal size. 
</P>
<P>
First, there are the television specials (yeah, I know I said movie marathon 
but Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without a few of these TV classics now 
available on video. Try shuffling them up and watching them between the real 
movies). 
</P>
<P>
This year, several specials directed by the inimitable team of Arthur Rankin 
Jr. and Jules Bass have been released for sale and rental. "The Little Drummer 
Boy" is a charming little piece that may remind one of the sometimes forgotten 
role played at Christmas by the baby Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
And what would the holidays be without "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"? This 
Rankin and Bass tale is narrated by a Burl Ives snowman and features many 
holiday tunes. Such fun characters as prospecting Yukon Cornelius and a 
bouncing Abominable Snowman highlight this tale of misfits in search of 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Rankin and Bass' "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" finds Fred Astaire narrating 
the story of Santa, letting us know just who he is and how he came to be. More 
toe-tapping tunes and endearing characters lace this favorite. (Incidentally, 
if Hollywood is listening, "The Year Without a Santa Claus," the 
rarely-televised story about the year when Santa couldn't deliver toys because 
of the worst blizzard in history, should be released on video. The singing and 
dancing Heat Miser is sorely missed.) 
</P>
<P>
"A Very Merry Cricket" is a wonderful animated special written and directed by 
Chuck Jones of Looney Tunes fame. It tells the tale of a cricket who brings 
Times Square to a halt with his Christmas caroling. Jones' best-known 
directorial effort is the quintessential Christmas TV special, "How the Grinch 
Stole Christmas," written by Dr. Suess and narrated by Boris Karloff. My group 
continually promises to save this one for the end of the marathon, as sort of 
its crowning glory, but none of us can ever wait that long to see it. 
</P>
<P>
And, just as we need to see the Grinch carve the roast beast, we need to hear 
Linus' soulful telling of the Christmas Story, and to watch Charlie Brown 
rescue a forgotten little Christmas tree, and to hear the Peanuts' gang's 
rendition of "Hark the Herald Angels Sing" in "A Charlie Brown Christmas." If 
you've only got one hour for Christmas viewing, Charlie Brown and the Grinch 
can fill it with decades worth of Christmas memories and cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Onto the movies! John Hughes' "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" is a good 
starting point even though it is a Thanksgiving film. Steve Martin is trying to 
get home to spend the holiday with his family. The hazards of the road and John 
Candy get in his way, and make for an exceptional film loaded with laughs and 
laced with a human warmth that should bring a lump to the heartiest throat. 
</P>
<P>
A good follow-up is "Miracle on 34th Street," the version that stars Edmund 
Gwenn as the bearded gent who must convince a very young Natalie Wood -- and a 
courtroom -- that he truly is the real Santa. (Again, you should only invite 
people to your marathon who will not mind displays of emotion. Both movies 
listed so far, and most that follow, are guaranto teed tear-wellers). 
</P>
<P>
For a change of a pace, you might want to add "The Nutcracker," especially the 
lavish American Ballet Theatre production that features Mikhail Baryshnikov as 
both star and choreographer. The National Philharmonic's spirited rendition of 
Tchaikovsky's score rounds out this excellent choice. 
</P>
<P>
If you wish to delve further down the fantasy path, try "March of the Wooden 
Soldiers." This 1934 film with Laurel and Hardy is the original "Babes in 
Toyland" and is far superior to the Disney remake (with Annette Funicello and 
Tommy Sands) that most people rent unwittingly. Although this film includes 
some tunes that are far from exciting, Laurel and Hardy are great fun as the 
toy maker's assistants who must save the storybook town. 
</P>
<P>
"A Christmas Carol" is a must, but which version? I recommend the 1951 
black-and-white one with Alastair Sim as Scrooge. It is well written and the 
acting is superb, on top of which you don't have to listen to Albert Finney 
sing. And Dickens' bleak world plays best in black and white, as a place of 
shadow and light. (You may want to consider before renting that this film is 
for sale at just slightly more than the rental fee. It makes an excellent 
addition to a home library and even comes in a specially priced gift package 
with the next film in our marathon: "It's a Wonderful Life." 
</P>
<P>
For many people, this classic is at the top of the Christmas film list. If you 
have not yet enjoyed the tale of Jimmy Stewart taking a peek at what the world 
would have been like had he never been born, what are you waiting for?!? There 
is a colorized version, but avoid it like the plague. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the black-and-white vein, "The Bishop's Wife" stars Cary Grant as an 
angel who attempts to reconcile David Niven's stagnating marriage by making 
moves on Niven's wife. Both funny and touching, it'll leave you smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bells of Saint Mary's" is the exceptional sequel to the Academy 
Award-winning "Going My Way." Bing Crosby, returning to his role as a 
modern-minded priest, finds himself at a parochial school butting heads with 
Ingrid Bergman's Mother Superior. It's a delightful film with many warm 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
"Holiday Inn" finds Crosby and Fred Astaire singing, dancing and fighting over 
women. It also marks the first appearance of Irving Berlin's classic "White 
Christmas" (later reprised in a film named after the song and again featuring 
Crosby, this time with sidekick Danny Kaye). If you're a Bing fan, "Holiday 
Inn" is a must. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas in Connecticut" is a screwball comedy starring Barbara Stanwyck as a 
newspaper columnist whom people turn to for advice in family matters. The 
problem is that she's not the Susie Homemaker type she pretends to be; she's 
really tough and streetwise. For the sake of publicity (and her job), she has 
to find house and husband for the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the '40s and into the '80s with "Ernest Saves Christmas." Yes, an Ernest 
film. I admit to being a fan, but even non-Ernest fans might love this one, a 
very funny story about Ernest's efforts to help an old Santa pass on his 
gift-giving skills to an overweight children's show host. Even though you may 
not entirely buy the borderline, maudlin runaway-girl subplot, this is still a 
film that should make you say, "Hey! It's Christmas . . . and I like it!" 
</P>
<P>
There's more Christmas comedy from John Hughes in "National Lampoon's Christmas 
Vacation" as Chevy Chase returns as Clark Griswald, the consummate family man 
trying to have a real family Christmas. Naturally, nothing goes right. From his 
harpy in-laws to the unexpected arrival of rural cousin Randy Quaid, Chevy's 
Christmas takes one downward slide after another. 
</P>
<P>
A true gem is "A Christmas Story," with Peter Billingsley (better known as 
Messy Marvin) as a boy who wants a Red Ryder air gun for Christmas. He schemes 
diligently to get one, only to hear from everyone -- including a department 
store Santa -- that he'll shoot his eye out. It's a charming, nostalgic look at 
youth and a bygone era. Darren McGavin plays the boy's father with a 
delightfully silly quality. If you haven't saved the Grinch or "It's a 
Wonderful Life" for last, you might want to consider "A Christmas Story" as the 
crown of your marathon. 
</P>
<P>
A very funny version of the "Christmas Carol" tale is Richard Donner's 
"Scrooged," with Bill Murray as a practically soulless television executive who 
receives the ghostly visitations of Christmas Past, Present and Future. How can 
you not like a movie that proposes a television special entitled "The Night the 
Reindeer Died" complete with explosions and Lee Majors? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there'll be a new addition to my group's marathon this year: "Die 
Hard." Yes, the Bruce Willis action flick about a lone New York cop up against 
a gang of ruthless, bloodthirsty burglars. Aside from the bullets and blood, 
you see, it's a film about a man trying to win his family back. He's come to 
Los Angeles to spend Christmas with them. Some people will argue for "Lethal 
Weapon" on the same grounds: It, too, takes place in the holiday season. Mel 
Gibson must learn to overcome the death of his wife, people get shot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One last note: for the truly warped, there is a film called "Silent Night, 
Deadly Night," which finds Santa running around chopping people up with an ax. 
This one has the distinction of having had its ads pulled from television 
because they were scaring little children and it most likely will not be in my 
group's marathon.

Ah, the Christmas spirit: John Wilson of Venice spotted a hand-printed sign off 
the San Diego Freeway that said, "Trees for Sale, Cheap as Hell." 
</P>
<P>
It's been a big week for bizarre freeway obstructions. The Artesia was closed 
the other night after some suspected armed robbers threw a couple of hundred 
dollars out their windows during a chase. 
</P>
<P>
Nighttime traffic also slowed near the Pomona's Euclid Avenue off-ramp in 
Ontario. The problem: Motorists were slowing to gaze at a huge Christmas light 
display at one residence. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was what KNX traffic reporter Bill Keene calls his "first ever 
'Dog-Alert.' " 
</P>
<P>
A pack of wild dogs charged onto the Glendale Freeway north of the Echo Park 
area, causing the freeway to be shut down for about 15 minutes while 
authorities rounded up the intruders. 
</P>
<P>
Keene called it: "A six-pack of curs." 
</P>

Jeff Daniels of Playa del Rey wonders if the mutant chicken described in the 
accompanying ad has two heads or, maybe, three wings.

Friday marks the 50th anniversary of the death of F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose 
final (unfinished) work, "The Last Tycoon," is considered one of the best 
novels about Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald, 44, died of a heart attack in the West Hollywood apartment of his 
lover, Sheilah Graham, a few blocks from his own residence on North Laurel 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
In her book, "Beloved Infidel," Graham reminisced about how she and Fitzgerald 
(who was on the wagon) would go "shopping at night in the supermarkets on 
Sunset Boulevard, or spend an hour in Schwab's drugstore." Fitzgerald enjoyed 
reciting Keats as they walked in the darkness and "sometimes a passerby stared 
at us and I would burst out laughing, but Scott would maintain a stern 
demeanor." 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, a group on a literary tour of L.A. made a pilgrimage to 
Fitzgerald's old apartment, only to be shooed away by the current tenant, who 
said she was weary of the novelist's admirers knocking at her door. 
</P>
<P>
And so we beat on . . . 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica, which is a bit different, may be the only city that can boast 
that its last three mayors have been arrested at anti-nuclear demonstrations in 
Nevada.

In 1948, Emmanuel Lutheran Church in North Hollywood became the first place of 
worship to inaugurate drive-in services. About 120 cars gathered on the church 
playground while ushers walked from driver to driver, passing out hymnals and 
taking collections. The drive-in services were discontinued about two decades 
ago.

AL MARTINEZ: TIME AFTER TIME

<TEXT>
<P>
Perched on a stool by a window one blustery afternoon, whittling away at a 
block of wood, Barry Lysaght at first glance looks a lot like a kid with 
nothing to do. 
</P>
<P>
You see them all the time, trying to fill empty hours by drawing circles in the 
dirt or finding faces in clouds, until their buddies show up and they can get 
on to more compelling diversions. 
</P>
<P>
But if you stop long enough at Lysaght's sawdusty shop on Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard and watch him for a while, you begin to realize this is no kid in 
mild pursuit of diversion. 
</P>
<P>
This is a guy lost in time. 
</P>
<P>
The bleak afternoon fades to night around him and the distracting buzz of 
commuter traffic sneaks through an open door, but he keeps whittling without 
looking up, his attention focused on the small chunk of wood in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
I watch him for awhile without asking questions because I realize I'm with 
someone trapped in his own sweet compulsion, creating something out of dynamics 
we don't understand, the way life must have been forged in the first place with 
fire and magic. 
</P>
<P>
Lysaght is a chunky little guy of 56, with thinning hair, a beard and 
clear-rimmed specs held together with what appears to be wrapping tape. 
</P>
<P>
His hands are big and rough, the kind you'd expect on a lumberjack, rather than 
on a guy carving the delicate features of an angel out of wood. 
</P>
<P>
He cuts in silence for a while and then I finally ask how long he can just sit 
there doing that. He smiles and says maybe eight to 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no time when I'm doing this," he adds. "The clock is off. I'm sliding 
into hyperspace. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
My son told me about Barry. He knows his old man is always looking for people 
who feel about what they do the way I feel about writing, though I never could 
explain it. 
</P>
<P>
The closest I ever came was to say I didn't choose writing for a living, 
writing chose me. 
</P>
<P>
Marty -- that's my boy -- saw Barry carving one day in his cluttered shop near 
the Topanga Feed Barn. "You've got to see this guy," he said. "He's a master." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed he is, even though he doesn't think so. Lysaght calls himself a 
whittler, not a classic carver, the way Steinbeck might have called himself a 
typist. 
</P>
<P>
Talented people are that way sometimes, prone to minimizing their gifts in the 
fear that someone will set a standard for them, when they know in their hearts 
that creation seeks its own standards. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's art emerged from a complex background of religious fervor and battered 
dreams. He began whittling when he was 7, forced by a fanatic mother to do 
crucifixes instead of the stuff he wanted to do, like the Yankee sea captain he 
kept carving and re-carving. 
</P>
<P>
He went through college and did a lot of other things over the years, but wood 
carving was always what he liked to do most; not in the convivial manner of a 
Geppetto creating Pinocchio, but alone and with intensity. 
</P>
<P>
Lysaght, like any artist, is a tangle of emotions, not the least of which is a 
melancholy that lurks just below the surface, rooted in a memory of his dead 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
Their marriage was ending in 1968, and she was flying off to Canada to stay 
with her folks for a while, when the plane she was in crashed. 
</P>
<P>
Barry stops carving to talk about it, the curved Warren knife in one hand, a 
piece of Malaysian wood in the other, himself a kind of still life. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks about all the things they might have said to each other, how the 
marriage might have been saved, but for the flash of pain and fire that took 
her away. 
</P>
<P>
"You never get a chance to do it over again," he says softly. "You never get to 
say what you wanted to say." 
</P>
<P>
He begins carving again, wood chips flying across the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"She was suddenly gone and it was all unfinished. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He was an alcoholic before, Barry says, and when he wife was killed, he did a 
half-gainer into an abyss of whiskey and cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
He calls it a light show that damn near killed him. 
</P>
<P>
How he managed to quit is still a mystery, except that a guy named Bob Harris 
put him to work remodeling a ranch and kept him working no matter how badly he 
performed. It saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
That was 10 years ago, and Lysaght hasn't had anything stronger than an aspirin 
since. The light show is over. 
</P>
<P>
Now he works at carpentry and cabinetmaking to eat, but wood carving is his 
sweet compulsion: the angels, cowboys on rearing horses, sleek tigers leaping 
into imagination, soaring birds. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just nothing I've ever wanted to do as much," he says without looking 
up. 
</P>
<P>
He's still carving when I leave, bent over the angel's face on a darkening day, 
lost in time and in those volcanic places where art is born.

OK ON INDUSTRIAL PARK DELAYED; 
</P>
<P>
NEWHALL: A NEW PLANNING COMMISSIONER WORRIES ABOUT HILLSIDE GRADING, TREE 
REMOVAL, AND SITING A SCHOOL NEAR WASTES AND AN EARTHQUAKE FAULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unexpected move, the Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission 
followed the lead of its newest member Wednesday and raised questions that 
delayed approval of a Newhall industrial park that had received a tentative 
go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the 212-acre project, designed by the powerful Valencia Co., would 
include 42 industrial lots, two commercial corners and a high school that would 
be paid for by the crowded William S. Hart Union High School District. The 
project has been moving steadily through county channels for two years. 
</P>
<P>
But commissioners voted 3 to 1 to delay consideration of the project for a 
month while the Valencia Co. prepares to answer questions posed primarily by 
Commissioner Richard Wulliger. Wulliger, who began his term with the commission 
last week, expressed concerns about the project's massive grading of hillsides, 
removal of 55 oak trees, and siting of a high school near industrial wastes and 
next to an earthquake fault. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look at things, I add up the benefits and I add up the burdens," 
Wulliger said. "I can see a lot of benefits to this project, but the burdens 
far outweigh them." 
</P>
<P>
After prompting the discussion that led to the delay, Wulliger voted against 
waiting a month, saying he was ready to turn down the project immediately. 
Wulliger, a probate attorney, was appointed by Supervisor Ed Edelman to fill a 
vacancy created when Betty Fisher resigned to take a job with the city of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The commission seemed poised to approve the industrial park north of the 
present western end of Newhall Ranch Road until Wulliger voiced his objections. 
Vice Chairwoman Sadie B. Clark had even called for a 10-minute recess so that 
the county planning staff could try to assuage concerns raised by a 
representative of the city of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
But after Wulliger's speech, Commissioner Clinton Ternstrom said he thought 
that the additional questions justified a delay. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be a response, in written form," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Lee Strong said he believed that the project was being pushed 
through too quickly. Clark said she preferred a delay to Wulliger's suggestion 
that the project be denied. 
</P>
<P>
Later Wednesday afternoon, Santa Clarita Community Development Director Lynn M. 
Harris said that while the city does not oppose the project overall, she 
welcomed the opportunity for further review. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter delivered to commissioners Wednesday, Harris asked them to require 
the Valencia Co. to redesign the project to preserve the oak trees, make 
additional improvements on nearby roads and evaluate more thoroughly the 
environmental impact of the proposed grading. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Valencia Co. left the commission chambers shaking their 
heads. Ronald R. Horn, executive vice president of the engineering firm Sikand, 
which has evaluated the site for the Valencia Co., said Wulliger's questions 
are answered in the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"It all really is already there, in the information we gave them, in the EIR," 
Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial park received preliminary approval from the commission in early 
1989 when the panel approved a zone change from agricultural to industrial uses 
and a plan amendment that would allow construction of the high school, planning 
Administrator John Schwarze said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Valencia Co. -- the development arm of Newhall Land &amp; 
Farming Co. -- was seeking permits to allow removal of the oaks, grading of 7.4 
million cubic yards of hillsides and dividing of the property into 42 
industrial lots.

HOYT H. BOHANNON; RETIRED MUSICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hoyt H. Bohannon, a well-known trombone player and studio musician, has died in 
a North Hollywood convalescent home. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime resident of North Hollywood, Bohannon died Monday of heart failure, 
said his wife, Betty Bohannon. 
</P>
<P>
Born May 22, 1918, in Daytona Beach, Fla., Bohannon came to California as a 
child. He spent a few years touring the country with the Harry James orchestra. 
In 1941, he entered the Army Air Corps, where he played for the Air Corps 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
After his discharge, he played with Paul Whiteman and his orchestra and as a 
studio musician for Warner Bros. He later worked as a free-lance musician, 
playing for television shows, various recordings and symphonies, including the 
Glendale Symphony during the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 40 years, Bohannon's studio at his North Hollywood home, dubbed 
"Hoyt's Garage," has been the weekly meeting place for trombonists who played 
music from Bohannon's extensive collection of arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 44 years; daughter Gail Bohannon of North 
Hollywood; brothers Clyde Bohannon of Oakland and David Bohannon of Long Beach;

BOOK ON SIMI VALLEY DOCUMENTS CITY'S RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Lone Ranger heartily exclaimed "Hi-Yo Silver!" it was away into the 
Simi Hills that he galloped. 
</P>
<P>
When Roy Rogers and Dale Evans sang "Happy Trails to You," it was in the Santa 
Susana Mountains that they clip-clopped along. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the tidbits that Simi Valley resident and free-lance writer 
Linda Aleahmad has included in her recently published book, "Simi Valley: 
Toward New Horizons. An Illustrated History." 
</P>
<P>
The book documents Simi Valley's rise from a small farming community to a 
modern business center, one that next year will see the opening of the Ronald 
Reagan Presidential Library. 
</P>
<P>
"Simi Valley has a very special quality all its own," said Aleahmad, who spent 
the past 18 months researching and writing the book. "There are over 100,000 
people here, but it still has a small town feel to it." 
</P>
<P>
Several pages in Aleahmad's book are devoted to Simi Valley's rich movie-making 
history. Since 1937, the rock-studded hills at the eastern end of the city have 
served as a backdrop for thousands of shoot-'em-up Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
The book makes particular mention of the movie ranch once owned by the late 
Hollywood stuntman Ray (Crash) Corrigan. Although the ranch, known as 
Corriganville, was destroyed in a fire in 1965, efforts are now under way to 
rebuild it. 
</P>
<P>
Aleahmad, a member of the Simi Valley Historical Society who has lived in Simi 
Valley for 20 years, said she does not consider her book to be a strict 
historical account of the area. "I don't think I would call it a history book," 
she said. "It's more of an overview of the development of the valley." 
</P>
<P>
The book, which will be distributed nationwide, was published by 
Chatsworth-based Windsor Publications in cooperation with the Simi Valley 
Chamber of Commerce.

Like thousands of reservists called up as part of Operation Desert Shield, 
these 95 never got close to the desert. 
</P>
<P>
In the ballyhoo surrounding the Persian Gulf troop buildup, their deployment to 
Germany and England got scant attention. 
</P>
<P>
But their leaders say these unheralded soldiers -- all volunteers -- performed 
an important role in the gulf mission. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people who realize what we were doing over there is family and such," 
Dorian Guerrero, 32, said Monday after he arrived at the Channel Islands Air 
National Guard base near Oxnard, where the Air National Guard unit based for 
many years at Van Nuys Airport moved earlier this year. "The general public 
doesn't realize. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't care," he added as he gathered his bags and scanned the parking lot 
for his wife Terry's car. "We're doing what we have to to help out." 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero, an aircraft technician who lives in Oxnard, and the other reservists 
spent 33 days flying support missions in Europe for Operation Desert Shield and 
filling in for troops who had been deployed from European bases to the desert. 
Nearly all of the 8,000 Air National Guard members who have been activated 
since the crisis began are serving outside the Persian Gulf area, Maj. Michael 
Ritz said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're taking over the missions that units in Germany and England normally 
would do," Ritz said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Al Gardner of Moorpark, mission commander for the Channel Islands 
contingent, said four C-130 cargo planes from the base took part in the 
operation, and three were in the air every day on various missions. 
</P>
<P>
"They did an outstanding job, but I'm used to that," Gardner said. "This is 
what we train for." 
</P>
<P>
He said more reservists from the base will almost certainly be deployed on 
similar missions, but could not say whether those who returned Monday will have 
to go back. 
</P>
<P>
The 95 Air National Guard members were the second group of troops to return to 
Ventura County since Operation Desert Shield began. About 300 Seabees from the 
Naval Construction Supply Center at Port Hueneme returned home from Saudi 
Arabia last week, and another 300 arrived early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
As the first of the big green C-130s returned to the Channel Islands base 
Monday, Pam Garnett of Ventura scanned the debarking airmen, trying to spot her 
husband, Warren, in the sea of green and camouflage-colored uniforms. With her 
were daughter Becky, 3, and son Justin, 6, who held a red balloon that said "I 
Love You." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been pretty worried," Garnett said before her husband stepped off the 
last flight. Although she talked with her husband on the phone once a week, 
none of the letters they wrote each other got through. 
</P>
<P>
"It kept me going, knowing that he was only in Germany, not the gulf," she 
said. However, she added: "It has upset me just as much. We're right on the 
front lines." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the reservists who returned Monday were part-time guard members before 
their activation but were full-time civilian employees at the Channel Islands 
base. So base personnel were especially glad to welcome them home. 
</P>
<P>
"We know all of them," said Dorothy Tatum-Floyd, one of a dozen people handling 
paperwork in the "demobilization line" that each reservist had to go through 
before leaving the base. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to see them come back," said Margarette Byars, who no doubt was a 
welcome sight herself. She was handing out paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
The 95 reservists, who included two women, spent two weeks at the Rhine-Main 
Air Base in Germany and the rest of the time at Mildenhall Air Base in England. 
Among the duffel bags unloaded from the C-130 cargo bays were dozens of cases 
of English, German and Dutch beer. 
</P>
<P>
"Customs says you can bring in three cases, but the commander limited us to one 
apiece," one reservist said. 
</P>
<P>
The flight back took three days, with overnight stays in the Azores and at 
Loring Air Force Base in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
The last flight was piloted by Lt. Dave Bakos of Westlake Village, who climbed 
from behind the controls and embraced his girlfriend, Ann Strum, and parents, 
Tom and Susan Bakos. 
</P>
<P>
"How you doing, Slick?" Tom Bakos said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so nice to have you home," his mother added. 
</P>
<P>
Dave is the second generation of Bakoses to fly the C-130. Tom Bakos flew the 
big transports, as well as the F-4 fighter, during a 27-year career in the Air 
Force and Air National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
The National Guard also is a family endeavor for the Kalvelages of Newbury 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
John and Cathy Kalvelage were at the base Monday to welcome home their son, 
James, a senior airman. "We're taking him out to dinner with a bunch of his 
friends," Cathy Kalvelage said. 
</P>
<P>
The family's reunion will be brief. The day after Christmas, John Kalvelage -- 
like his son an Air National Guard member -- ships out with his aeromedical 
evacuation unit, probably to the gulf, he said.

MORRIS DEVELOPS A JUGGERNAUT; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: GLENDALE TOURNAMENT TITLE THE LATEST NOTCH IN THE BELT OF LOS 
ANGELES CITY COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Reggie Morris recruited his first basketball team at Los Angeles City College 
in 1988 by showing prospective players the campus, the schedule of classes and 
just about everything related to the school except the gym. 
</P>
<P>
LACC was reviving its program after a budget-induced four-year hiatus that had 
left the facility in shambles. Morris, therefore, turned to other arenas of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had brought anyone into that gym and said, 'OK, come here, it's going to 
be great,' there's no way anyone would have shown up to play," Morris recalled. 
"We had chains on the door. Every time they asked about the gym, I said, 'Don't 
worry about it, it's being renovated right now.' " 
</P>
<P>
Today, the LACC gym has new paint, new windows and a two-tone floor. Doors that 
were once locked out of embarrassment are now opened with pride. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a three-year process," Morris said. "There are high school 
tournaments there now. People are wanting to play in the gym." 
</P>
<P>
And college players, in increasing numbers, desire to play for Morris, a highly 
successful coach and counselor at Manual Arts High who has quickly and quietly 
built a successful program at LACC. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the Cubs defeated Valley, Cypress and College of the Canyons to 
win the Glendale tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The victories improved the Cubs' record to 10-2, giving Morris a 56-21 mark in 
his two plus seasons at the community college level. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have always been there (in the LACC area)," Glendale Coach Brian 
Beauchemin said. "But it takes organization and structure to attract them and 
that's what Reggie has provided." 
</P>
<P>
Morris, 41, was a standout in basketball and track at Washington High and went 
on to compete in both sports at Los Angeles Harbor College and San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
He coached varsity basketball for 11 seasons at Manual Arts where his teams 
won: 
</P>
<P>
* seven league championships. 
</P>
<P>
* two City 4-A championships. 
</P>
<P>
* the 1988 state title. 
</P>
<P>
Morris also established himself as a pioneer of sorts in crisis counseling for 
high school students. 
</P>
<P>
He helped students troubled by gang pressures, family situations and other 
personal problems by talking with them and referring them to local agencies. He 
started a program called "There Must Be Alternatives," designed to help 
athletes and other students resist or overcome gangs, drugs and illiteracy by 
inviting guest speakers to address the student body at Manual Arts and at other 
Los Angeles high schools, junior highs and churches. 
</P>
<P>
When LACC offered him the coaching job and a career counseling position, Morris 
said he was faced with a difficult decision. He agreed to join the LACC staff 
when he was guaranteed that the basketball program would be funded on par with 
other community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy where I was at," he said. "I would not have come to a makeshift 
program set up for failure. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, I had been at Manual for 11 seasons so it was a new 
challenge. If I was going to have a chance to move up as a coach, I needed to 
make the move." 
</P>
<P>
Hired in July of 1988, Morris made up for lost recruiting time by focusing his 
efforts on former Manual Arts and Dorsey High players. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988-89 the Cubs averaged 102 points a game, finished 22-9 and won the 
Southern California Conference with a 13-1 record before losing in the final of 
the Southern California regional of the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman Watson (St. Mary's) and Chris Small (New Mexico State) from that team 
went on to play at Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Cubs averaged 104 points a game, finished 23-10 and went 
unbeaten through conference before losing in the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
This season, LACC has fallen behind by as many as 19 points at halftime, then 
come back to win. The Cubs' only two losses were to Cypress, who they have 
beaten twice, and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore forward Charlo Davis leads the team, averaging 18 points a game. 
Sophomore guard Develle Walker, who redshirted last season after an 
all-conference season in 1988, is averaging 17 points. Freshman forward Sean 
Hopson is averaging 11 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be no continuity at LACC," Canyons Coach Lee Smelser said. 
"Reggie has certainly brought that to the program. He's brought in some people 
with his name and his record. Now you have to reckon with LACC." 
</P>
<P>
Morris expects the winning tradition to continue. "We're getting people that 
really want to do it," Morris said. "It's tough sometimes to convince people 
that going away to college is not always the best alternative. There are some 
positive things to be had in staying at home and in having your family and 
friends be able to see you." 
</P>
<P>
Morris hopes to one day move up to the four-year level. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there is a lot of pressure and sometimes that can make you feel 
insecure," he said. "But as a competitor, you like to keep moving and satisfy 
that challenging instinct. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, though, I'm happy to be building this program and giving kids 
from the inner city a chance to continue their basketball and academic 
careers."

WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU; 
</P>
<P>
TAX REVENUE IN JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future city of Malibu could lose at least $1.5 million in property tax 
revenue because the County Board of Supervisors refused to apply for it on 
behalf of the city at its last board meeting of the year on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement issued Tuesday, Supervisor Dean Dana said, "Failure by 
the board to take action by Dec. 30 could delay property tax assessment funds 
for Malibu until 1992, (but) we are aware that the City Council-elect is 
seeking special legislation that would remedy the problem." 
</P>
<P>
"There wouldn't be any problem if the board would do what it promised in 
March," insisted Councilman-elect Mike Caggiano, who chairs the future city's 
Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In its March vote setting Malibu's election date, the board also agreed to file 
the proper tax documents with the secretary of state "prior to Jan. 1, 1991, to 
assure city tax collection." Malibu is to become a city March 28, 1991, but 
must apply for property tax dollars by Dec. 31 to get them during the next 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation will be introduced in the state Senate in January to let Malibu 
incorporate immediately. "Now we'll have to amend the bill to try to get our 
tax money retroactively," Caggiano said.

OFFICIALS JOIN URBAN FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of five Westside cities will join real estate interests and 
community activists on the board of directors of the Westside Urban Forum, a 
developer-sponsored group involved with land use and planning issues. 
</P>
<P>
Westside communities will be represented by Jane Blumenfeld, planning adviser 
to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley; Beverly Hills City Manager Mark Scott; West 
Hollywood City Manager Paul Brotzman; Santa Monica Community Development 
Director Peggy Curran; Culver City Community Development Director Jody Hall 
Esser and Stephen Lantz, Westside area director for Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Developer James Watt McCormick, the group's president, said the Westside Urban 
Forum was formed "to promote the discussion and dissemination of information on 
land use issues and real estate development proposals affecting West Los 
Angeles and the other cities in the region." 
</P>
<P>
The organization has held two discussions in recent months on the need for 
neighboring communities to work together to plan for development and avoid the 
kind of border wars that have arisen over major commercial projects in Culver 
City and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the board of directors include Heal the Bay President Dorothy 
Green; Santa Monica Planning Commissioner Paul Rosenstein; engineering firm 
representative Ann Banning; architects Marty Borko, Katherine Diamond and 
Kenneth Stein; developers Don Brackenbush, Michael Dieden, Marianne Lowenthal, 
and Daniel Rosenfeld; marketing consultants William Feathers and Molly Hunt; 
attorneys Barry Fisher and Richard Lawrence; accounting firm representative 
Paul Garity; public relations consultants Sydney Knott and Richard Lewis; 
consultant Tom McCarty Jr., and planner Mark Winogrond.

Leaders of Soviet Jewish organizations from the United States, Israel and the 
Soviet Union met over the weekend at the World Conference of Soviet Jewish 
Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
In sessions held at Plummer Park, delegates from various cities in the United 
States formed a national group to be known as the American Union of Russian 
Jewish Organizations and Communities that they hope will help them influence 
the decision-making process on immigration and resettlement issues. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the American group will meet again in Moscow in January with 
representatives of the Soviet-based Va'ad organization and Israel's Soviet 
Zionist Forum for more discussions on forming a worldwide group, according to a 
statement issued after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Our challenge is to get governments and Jewish federations to change their 
policy toward us from paternalism to partnership. It's a basic human principle 
to want to determine your own fate, and that is what we are seeking," said Roma 
Spektor, a Soviet delegate.

CLINIC EXPANSION BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction began this week on a major expansion of the Hollywood Sunset 
Community Clinic, which provides free or low-cost medical services to more than 
24,000 residents of East Hollywood, Silver Lake, Echo Park and downtown Los 
Angeles each year. The clinic, established in 1968, also provides legal and 
counseling services. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic plans to add a second story to its building at 3324 Sunset Blvd., at 
the corner of Micheltorena Street. It also will renovate and remodel some 
first-floor offices, said Felix Racelis, development director at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"This is long overdue," Racelis said. "We are really cramped for space and this 
is really a blessing for us." 
</P>
<P>
The expansion, the first in 10 years, was funded by about $200,000 in grants 
from the Los Angeles Community Development Department and about $127,000 from 
the state Department of Health Services, Racelis said. He said an additional 
$50,000 must be raised from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
Patients at the clinic are encouraged to pay for services, but no one is ever 
turned away for lack of funds, Racelis said. Services are offered by staff and 
volunteer professionals and interns, he said.

<P>
In a unanimous vote, the City Council last week directed city staff to study 
the feasibility of requiring new office buildings to include showers and 
lockers to encourage workers to ride bicycles to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I would bicycle to work every day if I knew I didn't have to get sweat on my 
shirt and collar," said Councilman Dennis Zane, who introduced the study 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The staff was asked to consider whether city-sponsored regional shower and 
locker facilities are good ideas because some businesses would be too small to 
afford their own facilities.

<P>
Mayor Judy Abdo, in the City Council's first meeting since she was elected, 
made numerous appointments to local, state and regional bodies and appointed 
herself as delegate to the National League of Cities. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat of longtime Councilwoman Christine E. Reed in the Nov. 6 election 
left open seats on the Southern California Assn. of Governments and Southern 
California Rapid Transit District boards. 
</P>
<P>
They were filled by Councilman Ken Genser and Abdo, respectively. Under city 
rules, Reed was allowed to keep her position as Santa Monica's delegate to the 
Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
Abdo also appointed herself as delegate to the California League of Cities. She 
appointed Genser and Councilman Robert T. Holbrook as the city's delegates to 
the Los Angeles League of Cities.

PARKING, TRAFFIC STUDY OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council last week approved spending a maximum of $65,000 to study 
recommendations on how to deal with parking and traffic problems in the Main 
Street shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
The study, which is expected to be completed in three to six months at a cost 
of $25,000, will assess the feasibility of converting two metered lots behind 
Main Street to validated parking. 
</P>
<P>
Validated parking atLot 9 between Kinney and Hill streets and Lot 11 between 
Hollister Avenue and Ocean Park Boulevard would discourage beach patrons from 
using the lots, which serve the business district, a staff report said. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the money will be spent on a traffic light near the Edgemar 
Project on Main Street between Ocean Park and Hollister. Ron Fuchiwaki, city 
parking and traffic engineer, said the light will be installed in six months to 
a year at a cost of $40,000.

MORE PREFERENTIAL PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another preferential parking zone was added to the city last week after 
residents near St. John's Hospital complained that patrons and employees of the 
hospital and nearby medical offices were making residential parking impossible. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 6 to 0, with Councilman Dennis Zane abstaining, to 
create the new zone, bounded by 20th Street to the west, 26th Street to the 
east, Wilshire Boulevard to the north and Santa Monica Boulevard to the south. 
</P>
<P>
The zone will also include 24th and 25th streets between Santa Monica Boulevard 
to the north and Broadway to the south. 
</P>
<P>
At a council meeting last week, residents and a representative of St. John's 
Hospital expressed support for the new zone, which will allow only residents 
with city permits to park between 7 a.m. and midnight.

FRYMAN CANYON LAND DEAL OKD; 
</P>
<P>
PARKLAND: DWP DIRECTORS AND THE CITY COUNCIL MUST ALSO APPROVE THE PURCHASE TO 
PREVENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE 63 ACRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has agreed to participate in a 
$10.75-million deal to buy 63 acres in Fryman Canyon in Studio City for a 
public park, a conservancy spokeswoman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy board voted 4 to 1 on Monday to pay $8.75 million to owner Fred 
Sahadi for the property, spokeswoman Julie Zeidner said. 
</P>
<P>
The vote apparently brings an end to a long-running controversy over the future 
of the scenic canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Under a resolution approved by the conservancy, a state agency that acquires 
parkland, the remaining $2 million would come from the sale of surplus Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power property, Zeidner said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a large concern that the conservancy not pay more than the appraised 
value," Zeidner said. "The conservancy and its board felt that state funds 
could not be used to give the developer more than fair market value." 
</P>
<P>
The deal must be approved by the DWP's board of directors and the City Council. 
The DWP board was scheduled to vote on it today, and the City Council is 
expected to do so on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Roth, a spokesman for Councilman Michael Woo, said he believes that both 
agencies will adopt the conservancy's resolution. The council approved the deal 
in concept last week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, in whose district the property is located, has been a leading proponent of 
preserving the canyon for a park. 
</P>
<P>
"I think at this point it finally looks like Fryman Canyon will be acquired for 
a park," Zeidner said. "The residents have been anxious about this." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Reznik, Sahadi's attorney, said he is pleased because "it appears this 
whole nightmare may be over. . . . It has been a long and tortuous process." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the conservancy board's vote was "the first definitive 
commitment" from the agency since the Fryman Canyon controversy began earlier 
this year when Sahadi announced plans to develop the land. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy board member Bob Horner voted against the deal because he said any 
amount above the appraised value of $8.75 million would amount to a gift of 
public funds, whether the money came from the state or the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's corrupt to give away the public's money," he said. "We've just voted to 
give a $2-million Christmas present to a developer."

AUDITIONS TEST NERVE AS WELL AS TALENT AS ACTORS TRY OUT FOR PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The young man was ready to freak out. Somebody had just told him that a 
photographer wanted to take pictures during his audition at the American 
Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
No way, he said. This thing was supposed to be private, just between him and 
associate director of instruction Lisle Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you're nervous," Wilson said reassuringly. "That's normal." 
</P>
<P>
"Is it?" snapped the young man, contemplating the photographer with the frozen 
stare of a deer trapped in the headlights of a truck. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, in the midst of an afternoon of auditions last week for candidates for 
admission to the prestigious Pasadena acting school, sent the young man up to 
the stage to recite a couple of prepared monologues. 
</P>
<P>
The theatrical audition is "a monster unto itself," acknowledges Wilson, a 
well-traveled actor who has appeared in movies, television sitcoms and plays. 
For the novice, it can be like peeling away a layer or two of skin and standing 
exposed to probing eyes. 
</P>
<P>
For the camera-shy young man, it was too late. The youthful auditioner's 
equilibrium had been shattered. He plodded up the steps to the academy's 
proscenium stage, moving in a heavy-limbed gallows walk. 
</P>
<P>
He collapsed into a chair, crossed his legs and fidgeted with his socks. He 
began the monologue -- a passage from Neil Simon's "Brighton Beach Memoirs" -- 
then he leaned forward, groping for a forgotten line. He slumped despondently. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson made him try a "cold reading," a recitation from a script that he had 
not seen before. The young man sat down again, reciting the lines with the 
script held tightly in front of him with both hands, like a shield. 
</P>
<P>
It was painful. Afterward, out of Wilson's earshot, the young man confessed 
that the whole experience had been like nothing he had ever been through 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary how your brain can just stop," he said. "I had the monologues down 
so good. But your brain just goes click, like somebody hit you over the head." 
</P>
<P>
Facing the vast open spaces of an empty theater, people have been known to 
freeze, gasp for air, fall down or -- if their theatrical instincts are working 
-- use their nervousness to give a performance an extra edge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the most unnatural things a person can do," said Wilson, who 
graduated from the New York branch of the school in 1966. "But it's the only 
way to get the part." 
</P>
<P>
More than artists in other media, Wilson said, actors put themselves on the 
line. "You cannot separate yourself from your art, the way a writer or a 
painter can," he said. "Your physical reality is up there." 
</P>
<P>
The 104-year-old Academy of Performing Arts, which has been operating in 
California for 10 years, tries to give its students the skills to "center 
themselves, to know how to set up a private space and how to attack the 
material," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
On this afternoon, the academy wasn't looking for actors to fill particular 
parts, but for talent -- raw, instinctive acting ability that could be shaped. 
Although the school, based in New York, has produced its share of stars -- 
Robert Redford, Jason Robards, Spencer Tracy -- it has developed a reputation 
mostly for turning out competent working actors. 
</P>
<P>
In his auditions, Wilson has to cut through some rough spots. Dena White, a 
Pasadena City College student from Indiana, tried a monologue from "A Streetcar 
Named Desire," as the fragile Blanche DuBois recounting the discovery that a 
boyfriend was gay. 
</P>
<P>
White, 22, said friends had told her that she should try acting because she had 
"the look." 
</P>
<P>
A thin woman with a large green bow in her red hair, White stood center stage 
with her arms crossed, as if she were trying to keep herself warm in a frigid 
wind. Her monologue was hurried, almost dispassionate, but sincere. Wilson 
decided to give her a chance. 
</P>
<P>
James Guymon, 22, an Orange County musician with some experience in community 
theaters, tried a couple of monologues, tripping over his lines, losing his way 
a few times. "I'm very nervous," he confessed. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Alvarez, 20, a warehouse worker from Walnut, gave it his all as a 
Bible-pounding preacher and as a young man recounting a sexual experience, but 
Wilson remained unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
"Acting is more than just getting up and reading the lines," Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right," Wilson said. "You have to take a script and break it down, figure out 
a character's motivation." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Danielle Lamar, 39, who owns a San Diego plant nursery, came in. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson gave her a script for a cold reading. Her monologue described a 
character's trip to a veterinarian's office with a longtime pet dog. The dog, 
it turns out, is too ill to return home and the character must have him 
destroyed. Lamar's voice tightened as she spoke, and she looked at the ceiling, 
tears welling out of her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon had been an average one, as far as Wilson was concerned. White 
and Lamar were in; he'd have to think about the others. "What they did today 
wouldn't get them into any play," he said. "They all need training."

TOP COACHES, LINEMAN AND BACK HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fairfax Co-Coaches Ron Price and Earl Smith, their quarterback, Rahim Muhammad, 
and Westchester lineman Wes Smith won the top Westside honors at the annual 
Times high school football awards breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Price and Earl Smith were named the area's Coaches of the Year, Muhammad Back 
of the Year and Wes Smith Lineman of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Carson quarterback John Walsh received the fourth annual Glenn Davis Award, 
given to the top high school football player in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh passed for a Los Angeles City and state single-season record of 4,206 
yards and 48 touchdowns. He led Carson to the City 4-A Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
The invitational event, sponsored by the Los Angeles Times Fund, brought 
together top award winners from 12 Times circulation areas: Westside, Central, 
Inland Empire (Riverside and San Bernardino counties), Orange County, San 
Gabriel Valley, Southeast, South Coast, Glendale, South Bay, San Fernando 
Valley, San Diego County and Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax (11-1) had nine consecutive regular-season victories without a loss and 
was the top-seeded team in the Los Angeles City 3-A playoffs. The Lions won two 
playoff games and were upset in the semifinals by eventual 3-A champion Los 
Angeles Polytechnic, 35-28. 
</P>
<P>
Price and Earl Smith were co-coaches for eight years at Crenshaw, where their 
teams had a 47-32 record and won two league championships. In 1982, the Cougars 
lost to Carson, 34-27, in the 4-A City final. In 1984, Price and Smith's last 
season at Crenshaw, the Cougars upset Banning, 26-21, in the semifinals, ending 
the Pilots' streak of nine consecutive appearances in the 4-A title game. 
</P>
<P>
Their three-year record at Fairfax is 21-10. This year's Lions were not 
expected to be dominant because the team lacked depth. Smith and Price had nine 
two-way players on a 29-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, who also was a top defensive back, was the force that drove the 
Lions. Price called him "this year's version of Venice's Louis Jones," the 
quarterback who was named The Times' 1989 Westside Back of the Year. "There is 
nothing on the field that (Muhammad) can't do," Price added. 
</P>
<P>
The Fairfax quarterback was the Coastal Conference and Metro League Player of 
the Year. As a runner through 11 games, he had 106 carries for 842 yards and 11 
touchdowns. As a passer during that same span, he completed 78 of 134 passes 
(58.2%) for 1,146 yards and 11 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Smith, a two-way lineman and special teams player, and his Westchester 
teammate, running back Charles Grissam, were chosen Western League Players of 
the Year. Smith was his team's leading tackler with 31 solos and 84 assists and 
also topped the Comets with 13 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
He had a 3.5 grade-point average and was awarded a letterman's jacket as the 
Westchester football team's highest academic achiever. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Muhammad and Grissam, The Times' All-Westside first team on offense 
includes wide receivers Darren Smith and David Saraf, both of Beverly Hills; 
tight end De-Milo Bynum of Fairfax and linemen Manny Nieto of St. Monica, Brin 
Morimoto of Venice, Chris Ziegler of Santa Monica and Avetis Avetisyan of 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Also chosen at quarterback was Ziv Gottlieb of Beverly Hills, and the other 
running back besides Grissam is Mario Mattison of Fairfax. The kicker is Culver 
City punter Rick Heineman, who also played tight end and linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
The first-team defense besides Wes Smith includes linemen Eric Gronemeyer of 
Brentwood, Mark Hochberg of Culver City and Eduardo Payan of Fairfax. The 
linebackers are Cosie Bridwell of Westchester, Mark Walker of Venice and Lee 
Brothers of Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
In the first-team defensive backfield are Keith Walk-Green of St. Monica, 
Tharen Todd of Fairfax, Jesse Elkins of Hollywood and Jim Ramming of Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The second team on offense has wide receivers Moriba Camara of Hollywood and 
Chris Johnston of Culver City, tight end Albert Jones of Westchester and 
linemen Glenn Vargas of Fairfax, Ernesto Carillo of St. Monica, Nigel Edwards 
of Venice and Arash Feydzjou of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The second-team quarterbacks are Dion Bergeron of St. Monica and Larry Elmer of 
University, and the running backs are Greg Holmes of Beverly Hills and Nail 
Benjamin of St. Monica. The kicker is Venice punter Dan Pena, also a defensive 
end and receiver. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, the second-team linemen are Brandon Bilderrain of Santa Monica, 
Ryan Watson of Fairfax, Delroy Bernard of Westchester and Bryan Lockridge of 
Palisades. The linebackers are David Shin of Daniel Murphy, Robert Hughes of 
University and Chris Wade of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive backs are Tim Kusserow of Santa Monica, Charles Gillum of Fairfax, 
Alvin Cooley of Venice and Matt Stringfellow of Brentwood.

IMMIGRATION: ANOTHER 350,000 SALVADORANS AND GUATEMALANS HERE ILLEGALLY CAN

<P>
In an unprecedented pact, the federal government agreed Wednesday to reconsider 
tens of thousands of cases involving Salvadoran and Guatemalan nationals whose 
requests for political asylum in the United States have been denied. 
</P>
<P>
Ending a five-year legal battle, the government also promised to stay many 
deportations and agreed that "discrimination . . . based on nationality is 
improper" in asylum judgments. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have long charged that immigration authorities routinely denied asylum 
sought by applicants from countries with pro-U.S. governments, such as El 
Salvador, despite widespread civil strife and political killings that might 
make those countries unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, approved Wednesday in a federal court in San Francisco, settles 
a class-action lawsuit brought in 1985 by 80 religious and refugee-assistance 
organizations across the nation, some of whom formed part of the so-called 
"sanctuary movement," which offered a haven to Central Americans fleeing their 
homelands. 
</P>
<P>
It marks the third time in recent months that the Bush Administration has made 
a major concession on refugee policy. Only last month, the President signed a 
landmark immigration reform bill that will grant refugee status for 18 months 
to thousands of Salvadorans, and the government previously revised the rules 
for obtaining political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
While the government does not acknowledge past bias or other wrongdoing in its 
handling of asylum cases, it agrees to rehear an estimated 150,000 asylum 
cases, according to Marc Van Der Hout, lead attorney for the plaintiffs and a 
representative of the National Lawyers Guild. The number includes cases that 
have been denied or are pending. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 350,000 or more Salvadorans and Guatemalans in the country 
illegally and who never applied for asylum will also be allowed to seek the 
protected status, Van Der Hout said. 
</P>
<P>
"This settlement is a major victory for all Salvadorans and Guatemalans in this 
country whose claims for political asylum were being summarily denied for 
purely foreign policy reasons," Van Der Hout said as the agreement was 
announced at a San Francisco news conference. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Robert F. Peckham issued a preliminary approval of 
the settlement Wednesday and scheduled a final hearing for Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is a fair agreement," U.S. Justice Department spokesman Joe 
Krovisky said in Washington. He declined to discuss the case further. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which handles most 
asylum petitions, also declined to comment and referred queries to the Justice 
Department. In court papers, the Reagan and Bush administrations had argued 
that most Salvadorans and Guatemalans denied asylum came to the United States 
not to escape persecution but for economic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement is expected to have a major impact in Southern California, home 
to one of every four asylum applicants and to the bulk of Central American 
asylum-seekers whose requests have been denied. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a very broad, wide-ranging settlement," said Linton Joaquin, an 
attorney with the Los Angeles-based National Immigration Law Center. "It's 
historic." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was welcomed enthusiastically by lawyers and advocates who work 
with refugees. However, many conceded that it is impossible to predict how many 
people will come forward to apply for refugee status. Further, a new hearing in 
no way ensures that the applicant will be granted asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Approval rates for asylum applications from most Central American nations 
traditionally have been low, INS statistics show. Only 2.6% of the Salvadorans 
who applied for asylum between 1983 and 1990 received it; 1.8% of the 
Guatemalan applications for the same period were granted. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, Salvadoran and Guatemalan nationals who have been 
denied asylum since 1980 will be allowed to apply anew; their cases will be 
judged under new guidelines enacted by the INS on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Under those new rules -- part of a $9-million overhaul of the asylum process 
unveiled earlier this year -- hearings will be conducted by a specially trained 
corps of asylum officers who are instructed to take into consideration the 
conditions of the applicant's home country. Advocates have said the new asylum 
guidelines may ease the road for foreigners seeking refuge in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's agreement also sets aside $200,000 to pay for programs to notify 
those Salvadorans and Guatemalans affected by the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
All Salvadorans and Guatemalans who are in the process of being deported will 
be notified of the settlement and be allowed to remain in the United States 
while awaiting a new hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur C. Helton, director of the refugee project of the New York-based Lawyers 
Committee for Human Rights, said it is unusual for the government to agree to 
reconsider such a large number of cases. He said there seems to be a new 
willingness at the INS to improve the asylum process. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a departure from the prior siege mentality that had characterized the 
INS' litigation position . . . ," Helton said, adding that he expected other 
legal challenges to be similarly settled. 
</P>
<P>
Van Der Hout said the government, in agreeing to settle the suit, appeared 
interested in avoiding a long, costly trial -- especially since asylum 
regulations are changing. 
</P>
<P>
"They (government attorneys) stated they wanted to start afresh," he said. 
"They stated they didn't want to spend the next few years litigating the past 
10 years, but wanted to get on to making the new asylum process work (better) 
in the future." 
</P>
<P>
To be eligible under Wednesday's agreement, Salvadoran nationals must have 
entered the United States on or before Sept. 19 and must register between Jan. 
1 and June 30. 
</P>
<P>
For Guatemalans, the deadline for having entered the United States is Oct. 1. 
Their registration period begins July 1 and lasts for six months. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadorans and Guatemalans with felony criminal records in this country are 
not eligible. 
</P>
<P>
The case grew out of efforts by numerous churches and religious groups to offer 
sanctuary and was filed after activists in the sanctuary movement were indicted 
on conspiracy and alien smuggling charges. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the INS often have contended that people from countries with 
communist governments stand a much greater chance of being granted asylum than 
people from countries with governments supported by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
They cite the low rates of asylum approval for people from Guatemala and El 
Salvador, where the United States has long supported government efforts to 
fight leftist guerrilla movements. Natives of Nicaragua, which until recently 
had a government opposed by U.S. administrations, were granted asylum much more 
readily. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials have said many asylum applications are bogus efforts by illegal 
immigrants to obtain a temporary work permit while the application wends its 
way through the system. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys who work with Central Americans said Wednesday's agreement stands to 
benefit scores of student activists, union organizers and others who have 
strong asylum cases that were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of these, attorneys said, is Guatemalan Edwin Colendres Monroy. As a 
writer for his student newspaper, Colendres, 24, told of human rights abuses 
allegedly committed by army operatives -- until two of his colleagues 
disappeared. After their bodies were found -- they had been tortured -- 
Colendres began to receive death threats. Later his father was beaten by two 
heavily armed civilians looking for the son. 
</P>
<P>
Colendres sought asylum in an immigration court in Los Angeles, saying that he 
feared for his life if he was forced to return to Guatemala. The petition was 
denied because the judge did not consider the threats to be sufficiently 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The federal class action suit, brought by church groups and refugee-assistance 
organizations five years ago, contends that Salvadoran and Guatemalan nationals 
have been discriminated against and were routinely and unfairly denied asylum 
in the United States. In settling the suit, the U.S. government agrees to 
reconsider tens of thousands of asylum cases and to stay most deportations. The 
agreement is expected to have a major impact in Southern California, home to 
the majority of Salvadoran and Guatemalan asylum-seekers.

FIRST ELECTED BLACK GOVERNOR, WILDER IS RISING POLITICAL STAR 
</P>

RICHMOND, Va. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a young black man waiting tables for white movers and shakers in segregated 
Richmond, L. Douglas Wilder recalls getting his first exposure to politics. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hear things that were going on," he said the other day, "and I was 
almost Ralph Ellison's 'Invisible Man.' People would say things as if we 
weren't even there." 
</P>
<P>
He is invisible no more. 
</P>
<P>
He has been a Virginia state senator and lieutenant governor. Last year he 
became the state's, and the nation's, first black elected governor. And now 
Lawrence Douglas Wilder, 59, is increasingly mentioned as presidential or vice 
presidential material. 
</P>
<P>
He is not discouraging speculation about his aspirations. He has made repeated 
forays into states that hold early presidential contests. His aides recently 
formed a political action committee to spread his message of "fiscal 
responsibility" around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder knows the dangers of national ambitions. In an interview in his Richmond 
office, he ticked off the names of black politicians who once enjoyed great 
prominence, then plummeted to disdain or obscurity: Adam Clayton Powell . . . 
Edward Brooke . . . W. Wilson Goode. In other cases, he noted, black people 
have held offices such as Chicago mayor and lieutenant governor of California 
and Colorado, only to be replaced by whites. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want us to be a blip on the seismograph," Wilder said. 
</P>
<P>
His recent statements reflect that ambition. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder recently told a Virginia symposium on the savings and loan crisis that 
"in the 1990s, it will be up to America's leaders to bridge the rapidly growing 
gap between 'Washington in Wonderland' and the very real landscape upon which 
the rest of America must struggle daily to earn a living and to raise their 
families. If they cannot . . . then they should not be surprised when the 
American people ask . . . them to step aside for new architects." 
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Wilder accused President Bush of "intellectual 
dishonesty" for dispatching troops to the Persian Gulf to reinstate rulers in 
"a despotic nation" but not protecting the civil rights of people back home. 
</P>
<P>
By vetoing the Civil Rights Act of 1990, he said, Bush "has abdicated moral 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
"I know what quotas are; I have experienced them firsthand," Wilder said in a 
recent letter to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Is Wilder simply outraged, or is he running for something? 
</P>
<P>
He said he is not running for President in 1992. Asked if he would rule out 
accepting the No. 2 spot on the ticket, Wilder smiled broadly and said: "I 
wouldn't rule it out, but I'm not running for it, and I don't anticipate it." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly anyone who watches politics believes him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's running for President," political analyst William Schneider said. "He 
doesn't hide it." 
</P>
<P>
"I think he is certainly running for something," said Merle Black, Emory 
University political scientist. "He is clearly advertising his availability, 
either as a presidential candidate or as a vice presidential candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder makes such good fodder for speculation for several reasons. His tough 
fiscal stance -- proposing to cut at least $1.4 billion from the state's 
$26-billion biennial budget and promising no new taxes -- produces the kind of 
hardheaded image Democrats think they need to win the White House. 
</P>
<P>
His credentials as a fiscal conservative are so strong that Richard Viguerie, 
the king of direct-mail fund raising for the Republican right wing, said 
conservatives might well consider supporting him. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, with Harvey Gantt defeated in the North Carolina Senate race 
and Andrew Young losing in the Georgia governor's race, Wilder has moved to 
center stage among black politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a rising star in the Democratic Party," said James Ruvolo, chairman of 
the Ohio Democratic Party. "He is socially liberal and fiscally conservative," 
Schneider said. "In my mind, that is a perfect formula for the suburbs. And 
that's where the votes are." 
</P>
<P>
But before he runs for anything else, Wilder must survive Virginia. Many 
Virginians fear that Wilder's proposed budget cuts will result in inadequate 
social services and that programs ranging from road-building to education will 
suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"People in Virginia have marveled at how much national praise he has been given 
while his approval ratings in the state are rather modest," said Robert 
Holsworth, political scientist at Virginia Commonwealth University. 
</P>
<P>
He could also face some criticism from liberal elements of the party 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Smith, political scientist at San Francisco State University, said it 
would be "a hollow victory" if black politicians had to sacrifice their 
"substantive policy agendas" for representation in high places. "The new black 
politician would then be a a shell of himself, more like a Prince or Michael 
Jackson than a B. B. King or a Bobby Bland," Smith wrote in a paper last 
February. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilder rejects any contention that his budget proposals are Draconian, and 
he seems to relish the combat surrounding them. During the interview, he 
happily recounted a meeting in which a university student complained that a 
college bowling alley might fall victim to the budget ax. The governor 
remembers saying that he was unaware that a bowling alley 
</P>
<P>
was essential to education. 
</P>
<P>
Two names surface whenever Wilder's national potential are discussed: Jesse 
Jackson and Patricia Kluge. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is an ally and potential rival. Kluge is a friend and potential 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who said he talked with Wilder before running for President in 1984, 
said that historic run and his 1988 campaign served to "change the climate and 
create new expectations," allowing blacks, including himself, Wilder, Rep. 
William H. Gray III (D-Pa.) and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin L. Powell, 
to become "a legitimate part of the political equation." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson did not rule out a third presidential campaign himself, reminding a 
visitor that he is a proven vote-getter and magnet for voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
Being compared to each other seems to please neither man. 
</P>
<P>
Kluge is the attractive divorcee of America's richest man, John Kluge. Rumors 
about what Kluge and Wilder mean to each other have lifted eyebrows because 
many people believe that Wilder's political career would suffer dramatically -- 
if it survived at all -- if he was romantically involved with a white woman. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical comment, Beverly Druitt, a black attorney who lives in Fairfax 
County, Va., said white voters "are not going to select someone as vice 
president or President who is hooked up with a white woman. And a rich one 
too." 
</P>
<P>
"I have said on so many occasions that we're just friends," the governor said 
tersely, adding that "if my being friends with anybody hurts me, then it hurts 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder has been divorced for 12 years. He is a lifelong Virginia resident and 
earned a chemistry degree at Virginia Union University in 1951. He was awarded 
the Bronze Star after helping wounded Army comrades while under enemy fire in 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Prohibited by segregation laws from attending law schools in Virginia, Wilder 
went to Howard University School of Law in the nation's capital, graduating in 
1959. He married the former Eunice Montgomery a year earlier. They had a son 
and two daughters before the 1978 divorce. 
</P>
<P>
His let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may attitude has fueled an independent 
course. 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP has criticized Wilder because of his support for the death penalty 
and because he opposes a congressional redistricting plan that would create a 
majority black district. He remains unfazed, complaining in the interview that 
the NAACP made the tactical mistake of failing to consult him on redistricting 
strategy before consulting with state Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his zest for political combat, Wilder knows when to fold. After a long 
silence while the U.S. Justice Department sued to force the Virginia Military 
Institute to admit women and critics urged him to speak out, Wilder only 
recently announced that he was prepared to testify in court against the 
taxpayer-funded school. 
</P>
<P>
Max Cleland, who is Georgia secretary of state and was administrator of the 
Veterans Administration under former President Jimmy Carter, compares Wilder to 
Carter, who ran for President in 1976 after serving the one-term limit in 
Georgia. The law has since been changed in Georgia, but Wilder faces a similar 
one-term limit in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were forced "to immediately start looking at greener pastures beyond 
their borders," Cleland said. "One can hardly blame them since they are a lame 
duck the day they are sworn in. Wilder has nowhere to go but play that national 
hand. It's a roll of the dice, but what has he got to lose? Zero." 
</P>
<P>
"You're only going to be here a second," Wilder said in the interview. "When 
you have the opportunity to influence change, I think you ought to take every 
possible opportunity to do it." 
</P>
<P>
To ensure continuity of black political progress, Wilder said, he wants to help 
black Americans create political "shark teeth," explaining: "When a shark loses 
his tooth, he doesn't have a gap. It's just that the back row moves up. That 
political cadre hasn't been developed in the African-American community." 
</P>
<P>
The development will come through a long-term "mentoring process," Wilder said, 
in which youngsters are taught politics and other skills, including journalism 
and police work, by those who practice them. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar vein, Wilder sent Bush a letter last week urging him to reverse 
the U.S. Education Department's finding that it is generally illegal to offer 
scholarships designated for minority students. Wilder warned that the policy, 
which was modified this week, would have a chilling effect on all programs 
targeted for minorities. 
</P>
<P>
On a non-racial front, Wilder said he will preach the moderate policies of what 
he calls "America's new mainstream -- that current which recognizes that social 
conscience and fiscal responsibility can go hand in hand." 
</P>
<P>
"When things are going well, I don't let it go to my head," Wilder said, 
standing behind his desk at the end of the interview. "When things are written 
otherwise or said otherwise, I don't let that affect me, either. I try to have 
an even flow. I pretty much know who I am."

DELAY GULF STRIKE, GENERAL TELLS BUSH; 
</P>
<P>

FEBRUARY. OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON EXPRESS CONCERN ABOUT HIS COMMENTS.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior U.S. military commander here has urged President Bush to delay any 
military strikes against Iraq until "sometime after the first of February" 
because troops in the region will not be ready for combat before then. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy commander of all U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf said Wednesday that 
American military forces will not be in position to go to war on Jan. 15, the 
deadline the United Nations has set for Iraq to withdraw its troops from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Army Lt. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller said that some American combat units will not 
even arrive in Saudi Arabia until the end of January and will require at least 
two weeks to move into combat positions. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. expeditionary force in the gulf thus may not be ready for battle until 
mid-February or even later, Waller said. 
</P>
<P>
The three-star general said that his recommendation to the President and other 
senior leaders is: "Until our full complement of forces are on the ground, they 
should not initiate hostile activities." 
</P>
<P>
Waller also said for the first time that U.S. ground, air and sea personnel in 
the region will number about 430,000 when the current buildup is completed in 
late January. Other American officials have studiously avoided putting a 
specific number on the size of the force in or headed to the region. 
</P>
<P>
Waller, signaling clearly that senior Administration officials do not intend to 
launch a strike against Iraq on the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline, said he could not 
"imagine what the President would say that he would want to do right on the 
15th." 
</P>
<P>
But if Bush were to order an attack on Jan. 15, "I'd say no, I'm not ready to 
do the job," said Waller, the No. 2-ranking officer in Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
The general's statements indicate that, from a military standpoint at least, 
the Jan. 15 deadline is largely irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: "I think what 
he (Waller) really said was that they might not be as ready as they would like 
to be, or ready for all the contingencies they could foresee. But we are 
assured they will be ready to do whatever they're called upon to do." 
</P>
<P>
Another White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Waller's 
statement did not "make that much of an impact" in the White House, but he 
conceded that such frankness was not helpful at this point. 
</P>
<P>
Senior military officials in Washington and Saudi Arabia quickly expressed 
concern about the "candor" of Waller's comments. The general's assertion of 
unreadiness, they said, might undercut diplomatic efforts to force Iraqi leader 
Saddam Hussein to comply with the U.N. ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials here also said that the general went too far in revealing 
the size of the deployment and the arrival date of some Army units. 
</P>
<P>
While the United States could launch a massive bombing campaign against Iraq on 
Jan. 15, military leaders in the theater would recommend against it because 
they would not have the combat power on the ground to back it up, Waller 
indicated. 
</P>
<P>
The general's comments came in a on-the-record briefing for reporters traveling 
with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said a day earlier while en route to the region that the bulk of U.S. 
forces would be in the theater by Jan. 15 but that there would be "additional 
work to be done before you would identify them as combat-ready." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney did not, however, indicate how long that would take, and he did not say 
that military leaders had cautioned against initiating offensive action before 
the troops are in place and fully equipped. 
</P>
<P>
Powell on Tuesday had pointedly refused to say whether U.S. forces would be 
ready for war on Jan. 15 or to speculate on what his advice to Bush would be on 
that date. He dismissed such questions as "hypothetical." 
</P>
<P>
But Waller said Wednesday that he could not understand "what is so magic . . . 
that on Jan. 15 we must be ready to go and initiate hostilities at midnight. . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
According to the general, the clock starts ticking on the U.N. demand after 
that date, not before. 
</P>
<P>
Waller also said that the chief concerns of military commanders in Saudi Arabia 
now are logistics and manpower issues. 
</P>
<P>
There are "tremendous transport problems" in moving tens of thousands of troops 
and thousands of tons of material into position for battle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Waller would not be drawn into a discussion about possible casualties, saying 
that all such calculations depend on how a war is fought and how long it lasts. 
</P>
<P>
Nor would he speculate on the duration of a conflict with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reuters news agency reported Wednesday that the United States will 
send warplanes from four Air Force tactical fighter units based in Europe to 
the Persian Gulf sooner than previously announced. 
</P>
<P>
The early deployments, beginning today from three bases in Germany and one in 
Britain, were prompted by operational considerations, said officials at the 
U.S. Air Force's European headquarters at Ramstein, Germany.

Soldiers had bullied her before, so Ruby Sioco wasn't especially scared when 
three heavily armed members of the local militia stopped and roughly searched 
her in this hamlet of bamboo huts one recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did she worry when the leader, a man known as The Cat, ordered his men to 
hold her until he found her companions, three members of a leftist union's 
cultural group, farther down the dirt trail. They were campaigning for a human 
rights rally, she explained. 
</P>
<P>
But moments later, she heard three sharp bursts of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cat came back and said, 'Your three friends are dead,' " Sioco, 22, said. 
"When he said that, I could not even cry. I was too afraid. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he told me, 'Go, run, escape!' But I don't run. Because if I run, they 
will shoot me, too." 
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 22 execution-style deaths of the three young union members at this 
remote sugar cane plantation on Negros Island are only the latest in what 
critics say is a grim series of brutal human rights abuses -- including murder, 
torture and rape -- in the Philippines' mostly forgotten war against Communist 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
While President Corazon Aquino's government has strict policies opposing such 
abuses in its counterinsurgency campaign, Amnesty International reports at 
least 40 "extra-judicial executions" of real or suspected opponents by 
government forces in the first eight months of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, is an improvement. Last year, the London-based group reported 
more than 200 extra-judicial deaths and dozens of "disappearances" of human 
rights activists, church workers, trade unionists, journalists and other 
civilians. Local human rights groups cite even higher figures, although 
verification is often impossible in the ever-violent, ever-murky world of 
Philippine politics. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the numbers, even top government officials concede that few if any 
members of the military, militia or police have been convicted of a serious 
human rights violation since Aquino came to power in 1986 promising an end to 
such abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, yes, we have not secured any convictions," said Franklin M. 
Drilon, Aquino's secretary of justice and head of the presidential human rights 
committee. "But it's not because of lack of will. 
</P>
<P>
"Our difficulty is we are only prosecutors, and we can only prosecute on the 
basis of evidence," he said. "In many instances, either we cannot find 
witnesses or the witnesses are reluctant to testify." 
</P>
<P>
That's not surprising. "We've had enough cases where witnesses tell a story and 
then they are killed," explained a Manila-based Western official whose group 
deals with international humanitarian law. "In most cases, nothing happens. No 
one is arrested, no one is prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
Even when cases are filed, "they die a slow death," charged Francisco B. Cruz, 
a leader of FLAG, a network of lawyers who provide free legal aid to political 
prisoners and families of victims. "It's all show," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's human rights record has tarnished her image in Washington, the United 
Nations and elsewhere, and it is a continuing source of discontent in a number 
of rural Philippine provinces. In some areas, the abuses have further fueled 
the 21-year-old insurgency by the New People's Army, the armed wing of the 
banned Communist Party of the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
"Human rights is one of our primary concerns," said Gen. Renato de Villa, armed 
forces chief of staff. "We're aware, very, very much aware that if the people 
are not with us, we cannot win this war." 
</P>
<P>
International human rights groups and diplomats agree with De Villa's assertion 
that military and militia abuses decreased in the last two years, while abuses 
by NPA guerrillas -- including summary executions, torture, hostage-taking and 
harassment -- have not. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, for example, NPA guerrillas massacred 37 members of the 
anti-Communist Itoman religious sect in Digos, Davao del Sur, beheading some 
victims. And last week, two suspected NPA gunmen burst into an Ateneo 
University classroom in Manila and shot to death two labor leaders holding a 
human rights seminar, the latest of more than 80 NPA assassinations in Manila 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
On the government side, military officials insist they file charges when 
warranted, but they blame other allegations on a leftist propaganda campaign to 
discredit the military. And, indeed, many abuses are difficult to characterize 
in a violent, feudal culture that features bloodthirsty religious cults, armed 
vigilantes, private armies and bandit gangs, as well as a bitter guerrilla war 
that leaves an estimated 1,000 people dead each year. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is compounded because the military has labeled scores of trade 
unions and social activist groups, including human rights organizations, as 
"fronts" for Communists, effectively declaring them open targets. And military 
officials invariably contend that dead civilians were killed in cross-fires or 
encounters with the NPA. 
</P>
<P>
"It is much worse now compared to the time of (deposed dictator Ferdinand E.) 
Marcos," said Joe Depiedra, 32, head of ARADO, a coalition of 22 legal leftist 
groups espousing agrarian reform. "Before, the military never bombed rural 
areas. We never had massacres. We never had these vigilantes. Now it is a 
regular thing." 
</P>
<P>
Negros, the fourth largest island in the Philippines, may be the worst-case 
example. 
</P>
<P>
Negros is called "Sugarlandia" because it is home to thousands of sprawling 
sugar cane plantations run by a wealthy elite and worked by landless peasants. 
Despite a $500-million industry and enough profits to pack baccarat tables 
nightly in a glitzy downtown casino, barely half the haciendas pay even the 
legal minimum wage: $2.20 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Since the work is seasonal, tens of thousands of families survive day to day, 
in debt all their lives. Children as young as 8 work in the tall cane fields. 
Hunger is so bad in July and August, when the cane has been cut and the mills 
are quiet, that the season is called the tiempo muerto -- death time. 
</P>
<P>
"I have eight children, but they do not go to school," said Marcedita Dayo, 51, 
a third-generation cane worker in a dirt-floor thatch hut on Hacienda de la 
Rama, owned by a wealthy Manila-based landlord. "I can't afford it. What we 
earn is barely enough for rice." 
</P>
<P>
As elsewhere, Aquino's promises of land reform were mostly empty. About 3,000 
hectares (7,400 acres) were given to farmers, but the government hasn't broken 
up major plantations or acquired tens of thousands of hectares that planters 
offered to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very slow," admits vice governor Rafael L. Coscolluela. "There are even 
voluntary offers that have not been touched." 
</P>
<P>
War, however, has touched much of Negros Island. An estimated 900 NPA 
guerrillas have killed dozens of planters, soldiers and civilians. The military 
has responded with Vietnam-style offensives that have entailed evacuating tens 
of thousands of peasants while soldiers turned suspect villages into free-fire 
zones. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1989, for example, the army's "Operation Thunderbolt" in southern 
Negros forced about 30,000 so-called "internal refugees" into poorly planned 
evacuation centers. With cramped quarters, inadequate sanitation and bad water, 
at least 200 already malnourished children died from measles and diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the military has used howitzers and helicopter gunships to 
assault an alleged NPA stronghold in the north of Negros, forcing about 2,000 
farmers and their families into dusty schools, crowded churches and an open-air 
cockfighting pit in Minapasok town. 
</P>
<P>
"Operation Habagat Alpha" has been accompanied by a surge in violence by 
fierce, anti-Communist religious cults that often work closely with the 
military. The groups are named for their red, white and green headbands and are 
feared for reports that they behead their victims and drink the blood. 
</P>
<P>
"The army is using these fanatic groups in the counterinsurgency war," said 
Vivian Vargas, head of the Negros Relief and Rehabilitation Center, a 
non-governmental group that helps the refugees. "So far, we haven't heard of 
beheadings in the north. Only death by torture. And skinnings." 
</P>
<P>
But villagers say most abuses are by members of the militia. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizens' Armed Forces Geographical Units, called CAFGUs, were created by 
Aquino in 1987 to replace Marcos' infamous Civilian Home Defense Force. In 
theory, the new militia was recruited, trained and supervised by regular 
soldiers and subject to military discipline. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, the CAFGUs often include members of Marcos' abusive militia and 
work with local vigilante groups. Villagers complain that the CAFGUs steal pigs 
and chickens, drunkenly harass women at checkpoints and threaten to name them 
as NPA sympathizers if they resist. 
</P>
<P>
On Negros, sugar planters and wealthy landlords openly finance the CAFGUs, 
contributing nearly $2 million a year to train, outfit and pay local units. 
</P>
<P>
"These CAFGUs are used by the rich landowners to protect the haciendas," said 
retired Bishop Antonio Fortich, a human rights advocate whose office was hit by 
an unsolved grenade attack several years ago. "But they commit atrocities and 
there is no control." 
</P>
<P>
It was a privately supported CAFGU squad that approached Ruby Sioco and her 
three companions at Hacienda Azcuna on Thanksgiving morning. 
</P>
<P>
Thin and wiry, Sioco is a women's group organizer. Her companions -- Aguinaldo 
Marfil, 19, Ferdinand Pelaro, 18, and Reynaldo de la Fuente, 24 -- were singers 
and actors in Teatro Obrero, a leftist political theater group from the 
National Federation of Sugar Workers. 
</P>
<P>
The military considers the 85,000-member NFSW union a "front" for the NPA. 
About 43 union members and workers have been killed in the last four years, 
nearly twice the number under Marcos' 20-year reign, said Serge B. Cherniguin, 
union vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you join the union, unfortunately you don't get better housing or better 
pay," he said. "You can lose your job, or even be accused of communism and just 
be killed." 
</P>
<P>
Teatro Obrero, or Workers' Theater, puts on political skits, songs and 
workshops in haciendas and hamlets, said director Alejandro Deoma. Two years 
ago, police raided the group's office and staff house in downtown Bacolod, 
capital of the province. 
</P>
<P>
"They confiscated what they said was 'voluminous subversive materials,' meaning 
our guitars, our sound system, the organ, batteries, our drums, microphones and 
scripts," Deoma said with a laugh. "They kept the organ, microphone and an 
amplifier. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it is more serious," he added. "We have always faced arrest and even 
torture. But this is the first time our members have been killed. Now we are 
the enemy. Now we can feel the danger. It is all around." 
</P>
<P>
Autopsy reports show that the three Teatro Obrero members were shot several 
times each at close range, two in the head. One villager said they were forced 
to kneel and take off their shirts before they were shot. 
</P>
<P>
"The CAFGU says they ran away, but if they are running, why were all the bodies 
side-by-side?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, the CAFGU squad's commander, Special Forces Tech. Sgt. G. 
Puede, was called to the scene. In a brief interview at his barracks in 
Mambucal, Puede said his men were investigating reports that the NPA was 
collecting illegal taxes on the hacienda. 
</P>
<P>
"My man engaged the enemy," said Puede. "They were armed with a revolver and a 
hand grenade." 
</P>
<P>
He refused to discuss the case further. 
</P>
<P>
Villagers insist they saw no gun or grenade. And Puede apparently never 
mentioned the weapons to his superior officer, Army 1st Lt. Cirilito E. 
Sobejana, who arrived later to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, no action was taken. Sioco hides with friends in Bacolod. The Cat 
continues on duty. No charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
At Hacienda Azcuna, a winter breeze rustles the endless stalks of cane, like 
fat sizzling on a broiler. Water buffalo wallow in muddy ponds, submerged 
except for horns, eyes and noses. Barefoot children chew cane to stave off 
hunger. Their parents use machetes to cut the cane, then load it on their 
backs, just as generations before them. Dark heavy clouds fill the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"What can we do?" asked Nulina Estrella, 54, who cuts cane with her husband, 
two children and father. "Men come in uniforms. I don't know if they are 
military or NPA. We are just the victims in the middle."

SAN DIEGO LEADS IN RACE FOR 1992 GOP CONVENTION; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE WHITE HOUSE IS NERVOUS ABOUT FALLOUT SURROUNDING KLANSMAN DAVID 
DUKE IN LOUISIANA AND THE ELECTION OF ANN RICHARDS AS TEXAS GOVERNOR, SOURCES 
SAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
The 1992 Republican Convention is likely to be held in San Diego, primarily 
because the White House is nervous about political fallout surrounding 
Gov.-elect Ann Richards in Texas and former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke in 
Louisiana, key GOP sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Houston, New Orleans and San Diego -- the cities competing 
for the 1992 convention -- completed interviews with the GOP's Site Selection 
Committee this week in Washington, and sources said San Diego emerged as the 
favorite. The site committee will make its recommendation by Jan. 11 to the 
full Republican National Committee, which will make its final choice Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Despite logistic and aesthetic concerns involving the San Diego Convention 
Center and San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, where a portion of the convention 
would be staged outdoors, the sources said California's pluses far outweigh the 
negatives of Houston and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is not just a front-runner but is in the commanding position," said 
a GOP source from California, who asked not to be identified. "At this point, 
the convention is San Diego's to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Among the factors working against Houston was the recent gubernatorial victory 
of Democrat Ann Richards, who at her party's 1988 convention delivered a speech 
that many in GOP circles considered a personal attack on President Bush, the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Richards said Bush was out of touch with the needs of most 
Americans, adding: "Poor George. He can't help it. He was born with a silver 
foot in his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
After the November election, Houston's chances dimmed considerably, the sources 
said, because of Richards' victory over Republican Clayton Williams -- for whom 
Bush actively campaigned. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having one of the best possible sites in the Superdome, New Orleans' 
chances have been hurt by the specter of state legislator David Duke, a former 
Klan member who recently was defeated in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat. The 
White House is nervous about Duke, who might run for governor or even as a 
third-party presidential candidate in 1992, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Another GOP source said many in the Republican National Committee favor 
Houston, the President's hometown, but the White House -- in particular, top 
Bush adviser John Sununu -- have made no secret of their preference for San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it ought to go wherever the White House wants it to," Angelo said. 
"And when I say the White House, I mean the President. If that's San Diego, 
that's fine with me." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Sununu, San Diego is backed by Sig Rogich, another of the 
President's advisers, who several months ago asked San Diego Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor -- a Democrat -- to have her city submit a bid. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, the mayor's press secretary, said Wednesday that meetings with the 
Site Selection Committee in Washington earlier this week went very well, but 
Downey cautioned against San Diego celebrating prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to know if we could handle two sites (the Convention Center and 
stadium), and we assured them we could," Downey said. "We felt it was a good 
session. They did not give us any indication whether we were ahead of or behind 
the others."

EDISON ELECTRIC BILLS FOR HOMES WILL RISE 9.3%; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: THE UTILITY FIRM WAS GRANTED A 6.8% INCREASE BY THE PUC BUT RAISED 
RESIDENTIAL RATES MORE THAN THOSE FOR INDUSTRY TO BALANCE PAST INEQUITIES.

<P>
Fuel-price increases, inflation and the continuing drought were blamed for 
utility rate increases announced Wednesday that will push the electric bills of 
Southern California Edison customers up 9.3% next month, the largest hike in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
A residential customer who currently pays the typical bill of $55.37 monthly 
will be charged $4.97 more a month under the hikes approved by the California 
Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Edison was granted a 6.8% increase by the PUC, worth $458.7 million 
annually to the Rosemead-based utility. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., with customers in Northern and Central 
California, received an even heftier increase. Its average residential customer 
will pay $8.11 more a month next year. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. was granted a smaller rate hike. Los Angeles 
city residents are served by the Department of Water and Power, whose rates are 
not controlled by the PUC. 
</P>
<P>
"What a Christmas present," said an unhappy Joel Singer, a staff attorney with 
Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a consumer advocacy group in San Francisco. 
"The customers who use the least will pay the greatest increase," said Singer, 
"and all residential customers will pay substantially more than the total 
increase." 
</P>
<P>
The PUC and the utilities said that raising residential rates more than those 
for industry reflected a need to balance inequities from past years, when large 
industrial users complained that they were in effect subsidizing residential 
power use. 
</P>
<P>
Edison spokesman Lew Phelps said Wednesday that in the late 1980s, several big 
customers threatened to pull out of the utility's system and generate their own 
electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had lost these large industrial customers, all the fixed costs of the 
system would have been dumped on residential customers," Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
PUC officials described the latest round of rate increases as "significant but 
not record-setting." It attributed the hikes to the costs of power bought from 
small producers, to rises in natural gas and oil prices, and to an expected 
reduction in natural gas availability in the winter, forcing Edison to buy more 
higher-priced oil. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer groups have challenged the prices Edison pays for power to companies 
it controls. 
</P>
<P>
The utility was recently penalized by the PUC for paying too much for power it 
bought from its own company, Mission Energy Co., in Kern County. The utility 
was charged $48.3 million as a result. Another challenge is pending that could 
force the utility to reimburse $51 million to its customers because of 
allegedly excessive payments to two co-generation power plants. 
</P>
<P>
Edison executives laid most of the blame for the latest rate hikes on increases 
in fuel costs, primarily from its third-party suppliers. The company, which 
burns more natural gas than oil, expects to pay 25% more next year for gas for 
its own facilities. Its suppliers will pay 22% more. 
</P>
<P>
The increase announced Wednesday is much smaller than those that came with the 
shock of the first oil crisis, in 1974. Then, overall rates jumped 30%, with 
residential rates climbing 18%. The second oil crunch, in 1980, brought two 
separate increases in just three months, totaling 29% for residents and 30% 
overall -- the biggest one-year hike ever. 
</P>
<P>
Rate adjustments in recent years have varied. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Edison's residential rates went up 17.4%, while overall the utility 
was granted an 8.9% increase. In 1989, residential rates rose 7.4%, again more 
than the overall rise of 5.3%. And last year, residential rates rose 4%, in an 
overall hike of 3.2%. 
</P>
<P>
The low 4% rate increase approved for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric further 
increased the disparity between Edison and its would-be merger partner. That 
hike will increase the average monthly SDG&amp;E gas and electric bill for 
residential customers by $2.25, to $63.33. 
</P>
<P>
Based upon Wednesday's action, Edison's system-wide cost of electricity, when 
measured per kilowatt-hour, rose to 10.3 cents. SDG&amp;E's systemwide cost per 
kilowatt-hour rose to 9.7 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The rate hikes granted Wednesday show that Edison customers are still paying 
for the co-generation power sources that Edison aggressively pursued during the 
late 1980s, according to Michael Shames, executive director of Utility 
Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group.

LOBBYISTS, SUPPORTERS ASKED FOR $2.5 MILLION FOR INAUGURAL FESTIVITIES 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican Pete Wilson is asking special interests and political supporters for 
$2.5 million to pay for several days of festivities celebrating his 
inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
The governor-elect, who made a point of refusing large contributions from 
special-interest groups during his campaign, now has appealed to capital 
lobbyists to help him finance the gala event by donating, in some cases, large 
sums. 
</P>
<P>
The lobbyists were among 50,000 people invited this week to attend the Jan. 7 
inaugural event and purchase tickets to related events -- everything from a $30 
ticket for the "inaugural fiesta" to a $10,000 "box" at the inaugural ball. 
Some were asked to be $25,000 "sponsors" for the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
It is not new for incoming governors to ask lobbyists and supporters to 
underwrite their inaugural events, but never has it been done to this scale. 
Organizers say the financing help is needed because, unlike celebrations in the 
past, the Wilson events include several that are free of charge and open to the 
public. They said they were confident that this inauguration would be 
Sacramento's biggest and most expensive to date. 
</P>
<P>
Inaugural officials, who contend that the event is social and not political, 
have elected to follow the practice of past governors in not disclosing the 
names of those who contribute toward covering the costs -- and that has 
provoked some negative reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"The people have a right to know who's paying for (the Wilson inaugural events) 
. . . particularly when they are going to the people (for contributions) who 
have business pending before them," said Robert Stern, general counsel for the 
California Commission on Campaign Financing, a private watchdog group. "I think 
the big problem is nobody's going to know. Frequently when no disclosure is 
made, people will assume the worst." 
</P>
<P>
Inaugural spokesman Dan Schnur said there are no legal requirements for 
disclosing contributors and Wilson officials believe it is far better for 
private individuals than the public treasury to pay for the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a political event," he said. "We are asking no more of any of 
those people than to put on the best celebration possible and we are offering 
no more than a chance to help us enjoy it," Schnur said. "There are no 
political considerations involved in this whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
But both Stern and Ruth Holton, a lobbyist for Common Cause, the campaign 
reform advocacy group, said that no matter what the purpose, a large 
contribution to an elected official is likely to be remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing wrong with raising money from private sources for the 
inauguration. It's certainly far preferable to the state paying for it," said 
Holton. "The real problem is not the $250 tickets but the $10,000 tables. Who's 
paying for that? That's where I would be concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Stern said the fund-raising efforts for the events seem to contradict Wilson's 
own past practices. In 1973 as mayor of San Diego, he said, Wilson pushed and 
passed the toughest local campaign-financing law in the country and then as a 
gubernatorial candidate voluntarily limited the amount of money he would accept 
from special interests. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the difference in money used for campaigns and money used for the 
inaugural?" he asked. "When a lobbyist gives the governor's campaign $5,000 and 
$5,000 to the inaugural, it's the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Schnur however, maintained that there is a vast difference. Contributions to a 
campaign are used to further a political career, he said, while donations for 
the inaugural finance a public celebration. 
</P>
<P>
He said this year's inauguration is expensive because Wilson wanted to extend 
it to as many people as possible. While tickets to the inaugural ball cost $125 
and tickets to the inaugural gala a minimum of $100, an ecumenical religious 
service, a Sacramento community welcome and the inauguration itself will be 
free to the public. Charges for most other events are nominal. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the $2.5 million to be spent by Wilson, Karl Samuelian, the Los 
Angeles attorney who spearheaded outgoing Gov. George Deukmejian's two 
inauguration events, said the first cost about $750,000 and the second 
$900,000. Citing severe economic conditions, Deukmejian's predecessor, former 
Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., did not solicit contributions or stage celebrations 
at the beginning of either of his two terms. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have thrown a party for Pete Wilson's 100 closest friends for 
significantly less money but our intent was to put together a celebration that 
as many people as possible could enjoy," said Schnur. "The more people you 
include the more events you have and the greater the level of expense."

I-5 FENCE PLANNED TO CURB ALIENS' DEATHS

Caltrans officials announced Wednesday that they will build a tall fence down 
the middle of Interstate 5 in northern San Diego County in an attempt to stop 
illegal immigrants from running across the busy freeway and being hit and 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to build the eight-mile chain-link-type fence near the Camp 
Pendleton border checkpoint was immediately criticized by one immigrant rights 
group, which said the barrier will cause more problems and deaths than it will 
prevent. 
</P>
<P>
The fence, which will be up to 10 feet tall, will be built at a cost of $3 
million in about two years between Las Pulgas and Basilone roads, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced this safety fence will save lives," Caltrans San Diego District 
Director Jesus Garcia said in announcing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, 38 people, mostly illegal aliens from Mexico and Central America, 
have died in the Camp Pendleton area and an additional 25 have been injured 
while attempting to cross the freeway near the checkpoint. So far this year, 22 
people have been hit -- a new record -- including 13 who died. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the victims were dropped off short of the checkpoint, a common practice 
used by smugglers to avoid immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the aliens run across the freeway to the southbound lanes to avoid 
the checkpoint, often darting in front of surprised drivers. Once they have 
walked past the checkpoint, the aliens recross the freeway to rejoin the 
smugglers for the trip north to Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia made his announcement at the checkpoint, where he was joined by Ben 
Davidian, regional commissioner for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service; Gus De La Vina, the top U.S. Border Patrol official in San Diego, and 
Ron Oliver, head of the California Highway Patrol's border division. 
</P>
<P>
The fence will be only one part of a concerted effort to keep aliens off the 
interstate. Other plans include placing signs that warn drivers about the 
freeway-crossers and billboards in Spanish at rest stops with a warning not to 
cross the interstate. 
</P>
<P>
"For the love of God, don't cross the highway on foot," the billboard message 
will read in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to construct the fence comes after Cal State Fullerton completed a 
study that called for a barrier as the best way to reduce the number of deaths 
involving pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
The Caltrans-commissioned study was released two weeks ago. It surveyed more 
than 100 policy makers, academics, immigrant advocates and others who have 
followed the issue. It found that 71% of the respondents thought a freeway 
barrier would be "very effective" or "extremely effective" in deterring 
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Smith, a lawyer in the Oceanside office of California Rural Legal 
Assistance, in a letter sent Monday to Caltrans Director Robert C. Best in 
Sacramento, called the Cal State Fullerton study "badly skewed" and said a 
barrier "is not likely to reduce the carnage and may well make crossings 
riskier." 
</P>
<P>
She could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

CITY TO HELP FUND WATER SUPPLY STUDY 
</P>

<P>
The city of Port Hueneme agreed Wednesday to contribute $31,500 to a water 
pipeline study to make sure the city receives its rightful share of any state 
water piped to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The United Water Conservation District, acting as the lead agency for 
communities it supplies with water, asked Port Hueneme and other cities and 
agencies to contribute to the study. It will examine the environmental impact 
of building a proposed pipeline and explore other ways to tap into the state 
water system. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the cities of Santa Paula and Fillmore have agreed to help finance the 
$300,000 environmental study undertaken by Casitas Municipal Water District and 
the city of Ventura. Casitas and Ventura have sought to spread around the cost 
of the extensive study. 
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme officials agreed to take part in the project's development to keep 
their claim to the city's annual state water allotment of 2,100 acre-feet, said 
Jack Duffy, the city's public works director. An acre-foot of water is what a 
typical family of four uses in one year. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the City Council has supported studying ways to import state 
water to improve the quality and quantity of the city's water supply, 
Councilman Dorill Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative under consideration is attaching the city to the 
Metropolitan Water District. Such a move could cost Port Hueneme $5 million to 
$7 million, excluding the cost of any water delivered. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Velthoen, Port Hueneme's city manager, said the city's share of the 
proposed pipeline costs could be $20 million to $23 million. Once the city 
knows firm costs for each project, the City Council will choose which option 
could most efficiently get the city its needed water, Wright said. Either 
alternative is going to be expensive but will improve the city's water quality 
by blending cleaner state water with area ground water, city officials said.

TEACHERS, DISTRICT AT IMPASSE, UNION SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
The president of the teachers union in Camarillo's Pleasant Valley Elementary 
School District said at a news conference Wednesday that union and district 
officials have reached an impasse in contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Ina Lea Parker, president of the Pleasant Valley Education Assn., said a 
mediator has been appointed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Teachers have been sinking lower and lower compared to neighboring districts' 
salaries, while student test scores have consistently ranked in the top 10% in 
the state," Parker said in a prepared statement. "It's just unfair." 
</P>
<P>
The district's 300 teachers are in the final year of a three-year contract. 
Negotiations began in October. 
</P>
<P>
Parker said teachers are seeking an 11% annual raise and full funding of health 
insurance benefits, but that the district is offering a 5.1% increase and $500 
a year toward health expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the 6,400-student district could not be reached for comment.

EX-CANDIDATE FOUND GUILTY OF THREATS

<TEXT>
<P>
A former Thousand Oaks City Council candidate who proclaimed himself to be 
Christ was found guilty Wednesday of sending threatening letters to five public 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Superior Court jury deliberated for 6 1/2 hours before 
convicting Norman (Blackie) Jackson, 35, of five counts of threatening public 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson sent letters July 6 threatening to hurt Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley), Thousand Oaks City Manager Grant Brimhall and state Sen. Ed Davis 
(R-Santa Clarita) unless they responded to a variety of his complaints about 
Ventura County government. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Lawrence Storch ordered a psychiatric evaluation for Jackson to determine 
whether he is a danger to the public and whether he qualifies for probation. 
The maximum penalty is five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to get back at anybody. I appreciate everything. It was a fair 
verdict," said Jackson, who had quoted Scripture and claimed he was Christ 
during a long, disjointed statement to jurors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
During deliberations, the jury struggled most with the question of whether 
Jackson intended to harm the officials, said one juror, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
"We believed he wrote the letters out of frustration, and he didn't expect them 
to change their views," said the juror. 
</P>
<P>
Another juror, Wendy Larner, said the jury thought Jackson's rambling letters 
were "wild" and indicated he was mentally unstable. 
</P>
<P>
Storch, however, had ruled Jackson was mentally competent to stand trial and 
allowed him to serve as co-counsel to his attorney, Jorge Alvarado. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is being held in lieu of $50,000 bail in Ventura County Jail pending 
his sentencing, scheduled for Jan. 16. MACK REED

TOLAND DUMP WILL BE CLOSED SATURDAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Toland Road Landfill between Santa Paula and Fillmore will be closed 
Saturdays beginning Feb. 1, and a program for recycling household hazardous 
wastes at the site will be changed to another day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Regional Sanitation District, which operates the Toland Road site 
and the Bailard landfill in Oxnard, is expected to take final action on the 
closure today. 
</P>
<P>
John Conaway, the district's solid waste manager, said the landfill has been 
operating from 7:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. The district 
is changing the schedule to Monday through Friday because Saturday revenues did 
not offset the cost of running the dump, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to maximize the amount we can get during five days. We're hoping 
Monday will be the better business day," Conaway said. JANET BERGAMO

<P>
The former president of the Rancho Simi Rotary Club has been charged with 
embezzling nearly $9,000 from the service organization, which raises money for 
various charities, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Wassil surrendered to a Ventura County Municipal Court judge last week 
after learning that a warrant had been issued for his arrest, said Simi Valley 
Police Lt. Don Austin. 
</P>
<P>
Wassil pleaded not guilty Friday to one felony count of grand theft by 
embezzlement, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Deborah S. Elliot. Wassil, who was 
released on his own recognizance, is scheduled to appear at a preliminary 
hearing in Ventura County Municipal Court on Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Wassil nor his attorney, Douglas A. Demaret, could be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they began investigating Wassil after receiving a tip from a Rotary 
Club member. Police did not reveal the name of the informant. 
</P>
<P>
Elliot said Wassil is alleged to have embezzled the money between February and 
June of this year while serving as the organization's president. CARLOS V.

SUPERVISORS RAISE LANDFILL SURCHARGE

<TEXT>
<P>
A county surcharge at the Simi Valley Landfill will jump from 30 cents to 89 
cents per ton after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3-2 vote, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors approved the increase 
with Supervisors Madge L. Schaefer and James R. Dougherty voting no. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Martin, director of the county Solid Waste Management Department, said the 
increase for trash haulers would be passed on to customers. 
</P>
<P>
"People are paying too many taxes. I don't want to vote for it," Dougherty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The surcharge, added to the landfill's normal rate, pays for the county's solid 
waste programs, including the Government Center recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the county projected for its budget that an average of 25,000 tons 
would be dumped at the landfill each month. But use of the landfill has fallen 
off, she said, and only 9,030 tons were dumped during September. Haulers have 
been using the Calabasas Landfill in Los Angeles County instead, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty said it was not fair to raise rates because there is less use of the 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the increase may be temporary if use of the Simi Valley Landfill 
picks up. She said Ventura County haulers may be excluded soon from the Los 
Angeles landfill. JANE HULSE

Billy Dreher of California scored all of his team-high 17 points in the first 
half and the Bears romped to a 121-97 victory over U.S. International Wednesday 
night in the highest-scoring game ever played at 58-year-old Harmon Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Dreher, who leads the nation in three-point shooting percentage, made his two 
three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
He has not missed in eight attempts from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
The 218 points topped the old record of 209 set in 1977 by Cal and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Drew scored 16 points for the Bears (3-2), and Roy Fisher added 15 points 
and seven assists. Kevin Bradshaw led USIU (1-11) with 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears led 63-40 at halftime, then extended their lead to 80-50 less than 
five minutes into the second half. The Soaring Gulls never were within striking 
distance the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Cal took a 39-24 lead on a Drew three-pointer with 7:50 
remaining before the Soaring Gulls made a comeback, rallying to within 45-37 on 
the second of Matt Tuite's 3-pointers. But then Dreher and Drew heated up and 
put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
With 2:11 left in the half, Dreher sank a three-point shot and was fouled on 
the play. He hit the free throw and the 4-point play gave Cal a 56-39 
advantage. The Bears led 63-40 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The 63-point half set a new Cal record for points in a half, eclipsing the old 
mark of 57 points against Stanford March 7, 1970.

INJURIES RAISE SOME QUESTIONS

<P>
As of Wednesday, the Chargers still were without a starting running back for 
Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Butts, the normal starter and the NFL's leading rusher, is recovering 
from a foot sprain. His status is questionable for Sunday and he likely will be 
kept out of practice all week. Tight end Rod Bernstine, the Chargers' other 
primary ball carrier, still is on injured reserve and Coach Dan Henning hasn't 
decided whether he will be activated. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine practiced Wednesday and looked all right, Henning said. Henning plans 
to watch film of Bernstine running and then decide whether he will bring him 
off the injured-reserve list. Bernstine probably will start if he is activated. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Richard Brown (hamstring) also may be activated off injured reserve 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Other Charger injuries: Wide receiver Nate Lewis is listed as doubtful with a 
wrist injury. Henning said Lewis is able to catch passes but may have trouble 
catching punts. Strong safety Lester Lyles (knee), nose tackle Les Miller 
(back) and receiver Walter Wilson (thigh) are all questionable. 
</P>
<P>
Henning expressed concern about Miller's back problems and said he will 
probably be downgraded to doubtful. Miller has been playing with soreness in 
his lower back since the Nov. 25 game against Seattle. He expects to play 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Steve DeBerg and running back Christian Okoye head Kansas City's 
list of questionable players, which reads like a James Michener novel. Others 
on the list are safety Deron Cherry (knee), receiver Fred Jones (ankle), 
linebacker Chris Martin (back), receiver J.J. Birden (groin), cornerback Albert 
Lewis (hip) and cornerback Kevin Ross (hip). 
</P>
<P>
Of DeBerg and Okoye, Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer said: "I would say 
neither one of them will be at 100% but both are liable to be available. With 
Steve, it will be a matter of deciding how he can handle the ball. There's no 
doubt he can play in the shotgun. The question is whether he can take the snap 
from center." DON PATTERSON

RAIDERS OUTPERFORM RAMS IN PRO BOWL PICKS

<P>
Bo Jackson, the AFC's 13th-leading rusher and still the second-leading rusher 
on his own team behind Marcus Allen, was one of four Raiders named to the AFC 
Pro Bowl team Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson became the first athlete to be named to the All-Star team in baseball 
and the Pro Bowl in football. Jackson was named to the 1989 All-Star game as a 
member of the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Other Raiders named were defensive end Greg Townsend, guard Steve Wisniewski 
and center Don Mosebar. It will be the second Pro Bowl trip for Mosebar, the 
first for Townsend, Wisniewski and Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Rams are sending only one player to the Pro Bowl. Jackie Slater, 
the Rams' veteran right tackle, can't remember when so many of his teammates 
have been denied so many postseason journeys to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
And if Slater can't remember it, odds are that it probably has never happened. 
</P>
<P>
Slater, 36, was the oldest player voted into the Pro Bowl Wednesday -- and only 
five years younger than the game itself. The Pro Bowl vote also comes the week 
Slater is about to tie Merlin Olsen for most games played as a Ram, 207. 
Barring injury, he'll break the record on the last night of 1990, against the 
New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
So, while Henry Ellard, Tom Newberry, Kevin Greene and Doug Smith, among 
others, will be otherwise occupied on Feb. 3, Slater will just go on, this time 
alone in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we didn't have a good year," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "I think 
that's the way that goes." 
</P>
<P>
The reverse is true in the Raiders' camp. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Jackson's flair for the spectacular influenced his peers. In eight 
games this season, Jackson has recorded touchdown runs of 55 and 62 yards. He 
added an 88-yard run last Sunday that received some attention. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has gained 605 yards in 97 carries this season, an average of 6.2 yards 
per carry. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson initially refused comment on his Pro Bowl selection -- he speaks with 
the print media only after games -- but later relented. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't consider myself unique," Jackson said of his selection. "I'm just 
Bo. I've been competing in sports all my life. It's nothing new to me." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he is thrilled at his selection to the Pro Bowl because the voting 
is conducted by NFL players. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people that understand athletes are athletes," he said. "You guys 
(sportswriters) think you know us, but you don't. So I do take that as a 
compliment." 
</P>
<P>
Some thought Townsend's selection was also long overdue, but this season his 
statistics were difficult to ignore. Townsend, completing his eighth season, is 
tied for third in the AFC in sacks with 12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been thinking about it all the time," Townsend said of the days leading 
up to his selection. "I really, really wanted it to happen this year." 
</P>
<P>
Wisniewski made his first Pro Bowl in his second season, a surprise in that the 
Raiders switched him from right guard to left this season to make room for Plan 
B acquisition Max Montoya.

STILL SORE ABOUT DEMOTION, MAYER EASES PAIN WITH GULLS;

<TEXT>
<P>
The perfect teeth and flawless complexion are deceiving. This does not look 
like the face of a man who wrestles for a hockey puck by night to put bread on 
the table by day. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Mayer, a 6-foot, 195-pound defenseman, could pack as powerful a punch on 
a poster as he does on the power play. So where are his bruises, stitches and 
scars to show for it? 
</P>
<P>
When Mayer, 23, arrived in San Diego from the Adirondack Red Wings Nov. 1, his 
wounds were internal, hidden from all but those closest to him. His 
reassignment to the International Hockey League from the American Hockey League 
team Glens Falls, N.Y., was the last in a series of blows to him and his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
But in his short tenure here, the healing process has progressed to where his 
scars are fading as fast as the points are mounting. 
</P>
<P>
His 14-game point streak was snapped in a 6-4 loss Saturday to division-leading 
and host Kalamazoo Wings. However, in just 19 games, Mayer is fourth on the 
Gulls' points leader board and holds the team record for the longest scoring 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
"It had a lot to do with the way everyone else was playing," Mayer said, 
spreading credit like holiday cheer. "Actually, it was kind of a relief (when 
it ended). You get to the point where you start worrying more about keeping it 
alive, and you tend to forget that you're out there for defense." 
</P>
<P>
Through time, Mayer's shifting mind-set has allowed him to forget the 
circumstances, which he's still partially unsure of, that brought him to San 
Diego in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer, from Rossland, British Columbia, was the Detroit Red Wings' third-round 
pick in the 1986 entry draft. That was the first of three years he played for 
the University of Denver, under Ralph Backstrom, current Phoenix Roadrunner 
coach. After a one-year stint with the Canadian national team (1988-89), he 
signed with Detroit and played in Adirondack, the Red Wings' top farm team, 
where he was the leading scorer in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
When he reported to Detroit's training camp this year, and was part of a herd 
of 200 players, Mayer first sensed trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get enough time to prove myself against all the rookies," he said. 
"Then when they were having me play forward, I knew I wasn't in their plans." 
</P>
<P>
When he was sent back to Adirondack, management encouraged him to get an 
apartment, which Mayer took as a sign that the Wings did have plans for him, 
but they were short lived. 
</P>
<P>
"Then they told me I was going to San Diego," Mayer said, who had been in a car 
accident and was dealing with a relationship gone sour at the time of his 
demotion. "At first, I thought it was a joke. Bad things happen in threes I 
guess. They just said they had decided to go with the younger players, not the 
best like they said they would. But I'm 23, it's not like I'm a fossil." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit had committed itself to a youth movement from which Mayer was two years 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it sounds crazy," said Barry Melrose, Adirondack's coach and general 
manager. "But we're committed to youth and we have three 20- and two 21-year 
old defensemen. We decided to have a young team, and we had to go with the 
kids. It was strictly an age thing." 
</P>
<P>
Melrose said it is never easy to send anyone down, and when it is someone as 
talented as he said Mayer is, the chore is doubly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to send someone like him down," Melrose said. "He's still a 
young man. Detroit's still very high on Derek and I still feel he can play in 
the NHL. He just got caught in the shuffle." 
</P>
<P>
Mayer tried not to take the cards he was dealt personally, but says there is a 
small part of him that wants to succeed for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a driving force," he said. "It was the first time someone just 
gave up on me, and you want to prove that you're good enough, that they made a 
mistake, and you want to shove it in their faces." 
</P>
<P>
With six goals and 16 assists, he's pushing, having already broken the 
career-high five goals he scored in 34 games at Denver in 1987-88. And Gull 
fans might remember the night his streak started. It won't appear on his 
individual statistics, but Mayer scored the winning goal, the 20th shot, in a 
5-4 shootout victory Nov. 9 against the Kansas City Blades. 
</P>
<P>
Gulls Coach Mike O'Connell, who uses Mayer in just about every conceivable 
situation on the ice, shares the theory that Mayer now is getting some 
well-earned attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people have to take notice," O'Connell said. "Wherever we go, someone 
asks about him." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell says he's pleased to have Mayer, but that Adirondack may have used 
poor judgment in releasing him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been real big plus for us," he said. "I'm glad Adirondack felt they 
didn't have room for him. I thought they made a mistake. I think he could be 
their best defenseman." 
</P>
<P>
Instead he is the Gulls' best. And for now, that's enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed at first (being in San Diego)," Mayer said. "But this is 
really an opportunity for me to stand out and do something for myself. I just 
want to make the best of things here. If you do work hard, things will 
eventually work out for you." 
</P>
<P>
That they've worked out so well this far is a surprise to Terry O'Malley, the 
University of British Columbia's hockey coach. O'Malley coached Mayer as a 
midget player at Notre Dame, a private high school in Saskatchewan, where 
hockey is a much a passion as football is at the other Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"That he went on and did well is a reflection of a hard work ethic," O'Malley 
said. "He worked at his weaknesses instead of his strengths, which is unusual. 
It wasn't evident as a midget that he would go this far, but through his size, 
strength and attitude, he's made it work for him. 
</P>
<P>
"When he went to Denver, he sent me a T-shirt and thanked me for my assistance 
in getting him a scholarship there," he said. "Not many players do that." 
</P>
<P>
As for Mayer's success here, O'Connell says it's pure talent, not chemistry or 
timing, that has allowed him to shine. 
</P>
<P>
"He can skate and he's skilled," O'Connell said. "He has all the tools 
necessary to play in this league and in the NHL. He just has natural ability. I 
put him everywhere -- he can skate and shoot, he can pass and read plays, and 
he's strong. He has all those things." 
</P>
<P>
Melrose says Mayer's expanded role and playing time in San Diego will get him 
noticed quicker than if he were playing in the AHL now. 
</P>
<P>
"He's playing in San Diego lots more than he'd play here," he said. "He needs 
people watching him, and that's what's happening there." 
</P>
<P>
Having seen him play in the IHL three times already, Melrose has determined 
Mayer is the best defenseman in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best in that league," he said. "I haven't seen anyone with more 
talent there. The IHL's a little more wide open than the AHL, and he can really 
showcase his skills there."

JULIE KELLY, QUARTET IN ACCORD AT CAFE LIDO

Add voice to an instrumental combo and things can suddenly change. The brass 
immediately become hushed, accompaniment becomes more predictable and the 
drummer reaches for the brushes. A certain tentativeness permeates the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't have to be that way, as Orange County-based keyboardist Peggy 
Duquesnel's quartet and singer Julie Kelly proved during the first set Tuesday 
at Cafe Lido. This was a case where the vocalist heightened the band's 
performance, rather than distracted from it. And we're not just talking volume. 
</P>
<P>
In a pair of opening numbers before being joined by the singer, Duquesnel 
showed herself to be an aggressive improviser, willing to take chances even 
when the results might not always be perfect. She would present a phrase, then 
twist variations from it before moving into some bluesy chording. A series of 
short, lyrical lines led to a long, whirling crescendo that Keith Jarrett might 
have admired. In accompaniment, she was spare, yet playful, dropping sounds in 
ways that challenged the lead. 
</P>
<P>
The opener, "Invitation," gave valve trombonist Mike Fahn (substituting for 
saxophonist Ann Patterson) a chance to strut his hard-hitting, yet lyrical 
stuff. Bassist Dave Enos, active in support, peppered a rhythmic solo with a 
series of double stops and quick descending lines. Drummer John Perett played a 
major role, punctuating the soloists' work with cymbal shots and tom-tom 
punches. His rippling snare line behind the pianist's streaming solo was a 
marvel of responsive interplay. A Duquesnel original, "Waltz for Diana," gave 
Fahn a chance to show his sensitive side when providing airy atmospherics above 
the keyboardist's well-turned theme. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly came out and immediately upped the ante on "A Beautiful Friendship," a 
tune pulled from her recent recording "Some Other Time" with pianist Tom 
Garvin. The singer spiced her warm tones with a slightly offbeat sense of 
rhythm that tended to emphasize the percussion. With a somewhat limited range, 
Kelly isn't one to cut loose with stirring high-pitched displays of dynamics, 
and she doesn't waste what she has on stylistic gimmicks. The singer showed 
herself capable of smart, well-paced scat and, at times, served as a vocal foil 
to Duquesnel and Fahn. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly and the quartet brought depth to the ballad "All My Tomorrows" and a 
happy-go-lucky bounce to "Better Than Anything," propelled by Perett's ringing 
cymbal play. Fahn broke the delicate balance of a sultry Antonio Carlos Jobim 
tune with an overly loud improv before slipping back into a more appropriate 
range in tandem with the vocalist. Perett, adept at using a brush in one hand 
and a stick in the other, dueled with the scatting singer over the intro to 
Dizzy Gillespie's "Night in Tunisia," before the rest of the group got in on 
the fireworks.

Name That School: Musician Frank Zappa doesn't view the possibility of having a 
new high school named after him as a compliment. Zappa's name is among 132 
under consideration by the Antelope Valley Union High School District board for 
its new school, set to open in 1995. "Considering the sorry state of education 
in California, it would be more appropriate to name a high school after Ronald 
Reagan than to name it after me," said Zappa, a 1958 graduate of Antelope 
Valley High School. BETH KLEID

THE RIME AND REASON OF STORIES COLDLY TOLD; 
</P>
<P>
THE SNOWY EKTACHROME PRINT LANDSCAPES OF LARRY JOHNSON ARE BRACING . . . AND 
UNNERVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judging from his exceptional new Ektachrome prints on view at the Stuart Regen 
Gallery in West Hollywood, it is the winter of Larry Johnson's discontent. 
Figuratively and literally. 
</P>
<P>
Here, discontent signifies the opposite of contentment, but it flatly means the 
opposite of content, or essential meaning, too. Johnson's large-scale pictures, 
which feel as empty as the vacuum of outer space, are radically drained of 
typical notions of visual meaning. Each features a snowy landscape, but it's 
more than just the image that generates their frostbitten coldness. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's pictures -- they're photographic, but it doesn't do to call them 
photographs -- feature text-laden signs incongruously planted in Disney-like 
renditions of icy, winter fields. Each Ektachrome print began as a small 
landscape painting. Commercially printed text was then added to a space left 
for the sign, and the whole thing was photographed. One print, enlarged to as 
much as 5 by 7 feet, was made, and the small painting destroyed. Each print is 
thus a "unique original," which deftly collapses painting, printing and 
photography into one another. 
</P>
<P>
The huge enlargement of the painting and its printed typeface fuzzes their 
edges, softening the crisp line and the saturated colors. Indigo skies are 
pierced by barren trees, clumps of freshly fallen snow artfully cap the 
mountaintops, and neither animal nor human being is glimpsed. In fact, the only 
trace of human life is the presence of the big signs, one per picture, which 
carry peculiar tales about beauty, existentialism, transcendence, identity and 
alienation -- classic subjects in modern art. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's stories aren't lofty or learned. They have the chummy, casual 
demeanor of gossip or gags; the dissertation on beauty is told through chatty 
references to hand creams and cosmetics, the one on transcendence is a black 
joke about dead rabbits. And visually, the disconcerting image of a 
sign-in-the-wilderness recalls nothing so much as illustrations in a children's 
book, or perhaps a common animation cel. 
</P>
<P>
With their showy air of highly refined triviality, there's something dandified 
in both the image and the text. Johnson is a virtuoso of a camp aesthetic, 
which is here turned toward the banal pretentiousness of the canons of modern 
art. But his own art never sneers. Instead, its icy coldness is bracing -- and 
unnerving. Johnson's pictures are like wake-up calls. No one appears in the 
remote and empty picture to read his signs -- no one save the solitary viewer 
in the gallery who stands before them. And any questions of essential meaning 
are democratically left to him. 
</P>

Quirky Conception: In several group exhibitions during the last few years, the 
sculptures of Patrick Nickell have compelled attention for their unpretentious 
means and the quirkiness of their conception. Often made from cardboard, the 
abstract, sometimes large-scale forms played against such traditional 
sculptural concerns as gravity, weight, permanence and aggressiveness. Products 
of the hand, rather than the foundry or construction shop, they redirected 
sculptural conventions toward improvisation in the makeshift studio. 
</P>
<P>
"Built for Speed," as Nickell's first gallery solo show is tellingly titled, 
does the same, but in ways that suggest a new sophistication and complexity. 
The eight, modestly sized wall-sculptures at Sue Spaid Fine Art are composed 
from cut and glued corrugated-cardboard and plastic wrapping. Sometimes, their 
surfaces are marked with pencil or felt-tip pen. Added up, these are ordinary 
packing and labeling materials familiar to the shipping clerk. 
</P>
<P>
With a seemingly casual, extemporaneous elegance reminiscent of the eccentric 
work of Richard Tuttle, Nickell fashions these packing materials into 
unassuming containers not intended to hold objects, but meant to carry a 
sculptor's primary substance: space. The cardboard is most often cut into a 
long, lozenge-like shape (imagine the tongue of a shoe), then folded in various 
ways. Finally, it's made into one plane of an otherwise transparent volume, 
through the addition of plastic wrapping. 
</P>
<P>
The small object that results may be appended to others like it, or pierced 
with other forms, or nested inside them. Because folded cardboard wants to 
unfold, stretching the plastic taut around the volume, the enclosed space gains 
a tensile resonance that is quietly vibrant. Some of these space-containers get 
fairly baroque -- if that's not too florid a word for small sculptures made 
from such humble materials -- and when they do, they can scuttle out of 
control. More often, they mix just the right amount of peculiarity and calm 
assurance. 
</P>
<P>
* Sue Spaid Fine Art, 7454 1/2 Beverly Blvd.; (213) 935-6153. To Dec. 30.

<P>
Life With Dada: The significance of the iconoclastic Marcel Duchamp to the 
1960s watershed in art cannot be overstated. Pop, Minimal and Conceptual art of 
the period claimed a historical foundation in his early, life-long insistence 
that meaning is not simply inherent in a painting or a sculpture, but is 
instead contingent upon the context within which the work of art is made and 
experienced. Art is an idea that emerges from a whole culture, the Dada artist 
once explained, which means the spectator participates in making the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
This commitment seems especially relevant to "Marcel Duchamp: 1887 -- 1968" at 
Shoshana Wayne Gallery in Santa Monica. Assembled in part as a reminder of the 
widely influential exhibition of the artist's work held in the fall of 1963 at 
the old Pasadena Museum of Art, the gallery show prompts questions. For 
instance, the poster for the museum show was based on a police "Wanted" poster, 
with Duchamp cast in the role of outlaw. Could the poster have been a seed that 
blossomed several months later in Andy Warhol's series of outlaw paintings, 
"Most Wanted Men"? 
</P>
<P>
A display of photographs by Julian Wasser shows Duchamp and Warhol at the 
Pasadena Museum opening. Also shown are Edward Ruscha, Larry Bell, Billy Al 
Bengston, Eve Babbitz, Dennis Hopper and others, suggesting the possible 
importance of the show to a number of younger artists and writers on the West 
Coast. This last will be the subject of the collected essays in "West Coast 
Duchamp," to be published this winter by Grassfield Press, in association with 
the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
If meaning is contingent on context, however, it might be equally productive to 
turn around the show's presumed question of influence, and wonder whether 
Duchamp himself might have been affected by his foray to Los Angeles. Of the 
show's 22 assembled works, 16 are multiple editions, all of them issued after 
the Pasadena show, in 1964-65. Why suddenly issue editions of earlier work? 
</P>
<P>
Supervised by the artist and his steadfast critical champion, Arturo Schwartz, 
the multiples are based on Duchamp's classic "readymades" from a half-century 
before, in which ordinary, mass-produced objects were designated as art: a 
bathroom urinal called "Fountain," a typewriter dust cover named "Traveler's 
Folding Item," a snow shovel titled "In Advance of a Broken Arm" and more. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the multiples responded to widespread contemporary interest in 
Duchamp's Dada objects from the 1910s, many of which had been lost. The 
punster-artist may have perceived a new "readymade market." And a layer of 
resonance also was added in multiple versions of unique art objects that had 
begun life as mass-produced items. 
</P>
<P>
Still, perusing this provocative show it's reasonable to wonder what role, if 
any, might have been played by the European expatriate's experience in the 
first mass-culture city in the world. Let's hope "West Coast Duchamp" will 
speculate.

SCHOOL FINDS NO BASIS FOR RACISM CHARGE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: CONTROVERSIAL TEACHER INSTEAD IS REPRIMANDED FOR USING INAPPROPRIATE 
AND INSENSITIVE LANGUAGE IN CLASS. 
</P>

<P>
A school investigation into allegations of racism by a calculus teacher at 
Manual Arts High School found no basis for the charge, but resulted in a 
reprimand for his use of inappropriate and insensitive language in class, 
administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Jim Horsman, who uses confrontational methods to challenge his 
all-minority classes, received a three-page letter this week that read in part: 
"There are some statements by students that you make racial comments on 
occasion but that some students don't take them seriously or personally. 
</P>
<P>
"I am directing you to be vigilant in guarding against the use of any language 
or commentary that may be perceived as inappropriate or insensitive to any 
racial and/or ethnic group," wrote Manual Arts Principal Marvin Starer, who 
declined to comment on the letter. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation started in October after a student complained that Horsman 
allegedly said in class that blacks cannot do calculus because they are 
ignorant. Horsman, who admits he uses "reverse psychology" to motivate 
students, denies that he ever made such a statement. 
</P>
<P>
He also has come under fire for other teaching tactics, such as occasionally 
requiring his tardy students to do pushups to instill discipline -- even though 
he reportedly did pushups with them. 
</P>
<P>
Horsman built up Manual Arts' calculus program from five to 30 students since 
1986, including seven high school students who now take advanced calculus at 
USC. He faced a transfer or suspension if the allegations of racism were found 
to be true. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week, Horsman said he will try to change his style to 
comply with the directives outlined in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"The principal wants me to be a better teacher and I'm going to try," Horsman 
said. He also apologized to his students for upsetting them. "I'm going to have 
to be more sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
But many who raised complaints about Horsman's teaching methods said the 
school's administration did not go far enough in reprimanding him. 
</P>
<P>
"It just makes my blood boil, he got nothing more than a hand-slap," said 
Margaret Henderson, aunt of Tiaqia Lewis, who transferred out of Manual Arts 
after she broke her arm doing pushups in what school authorities say was a 
freak accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The very, very sad thing is that it's the students who lose out," said 
Henderson, contending that Manual Arts administrators did not listen closely to 
their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over Horsman's tactics polarized teachers, students and 
administrators this fall, prompting questions about how far teachers should go 
in pursuit of excellence when traditional methods fail. Manual Arts, with a 
student body that is 70% Latino and 30% black, is located in the low-income, 
gang-blighted area near USC. 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing furor prompted fierce denunciations from parents and teachers who 
said Horsman's confrontational methods lowered the self-esteem of students. But 
the calculus teacher also received 100 letters of support from students and a 
classroom visit from another controversial calculus teacher -- Garfield High 
School's Jaime Escalante, who visited to show solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
Horsman now concedes that his methods may not work for all students. 
</P>
<P>
"If you say something that is interesting and provocative, it could be taken 
out of context and you could have a problem," Horsman said. 
</P>
<P>
But Manual Arts teacher Joshua Pechthalt called Horsman an elitist who uses a 
racist teaching style. He says 30 teachers at Manual Arts signed a letter 
condemning Horsman. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an issue here -- should teachers be permited to use racist, sexist, 
elitist and demeaning language in class," Pechthalt says. "The issue is not 
whether (students) took it personally." 
</P>
<P>
Horsman points out that many of his current and former pupils say he helped 
them drop out of gangs, develop self-esteem and enter college.

TEAM IS SCRAMBLING TO HELP MENTALLY ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Skid Row, the mentally ill struggle through life with varying degrees of 
effectiveness. Some manage to find food and warmth at nonprofit shelters for 
the homeless. Others sleep in doorways and go hungry. 
</P>
<P>
Some try vainly to cope with their paranoia and hallucinations by taking street 
drugs. In the worst cases, they keep only tenuous contact with reality; 
tattered, confused, they wander listlessly or step out into the streets in 
front of traffic. Some become so disoriented or physically ill they cannot 
communicate their own names or where they are from. 
</P>
<P>
If they receive help -- and the "if" is a large one -- it is often because of 
Karen Palermo and the five-member Psychiatric Mobile Response Team she 
supervises on behalf of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, Palermo has run the team from the sparsely furnished offices of 
a county mental health clinic at 6th and San Pedro streets. Along with her 
colleagues, Palermo is in charge of handling psychiatric emergencies in a wide 
swath of downtown extending from Skid Row into East Los Angeles and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
She learns of crises by taking reports from residents or relatives of the 
mentally ill. Her task is then to travel to the scene -- sometimes in private 
homes, sometimes on the streets -- to conduct on-the-spot psychiatric 
evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
If the individual is judged to be dangerous to himself or to others, Palermo 
exercises legal authority to order a 72-hour protective hold. Usually the 
subject of her evaluation is then whisked away by ambulance, sometimes with the 
aid of police, so that further psychiatric testing can be done. Often, the 
person is routed into a mental health program or to a psychiatric hospital bed 
-- if one is available. 
</P>
<P>
Palermo's team has faced an escalating workload even as dwindling budgets have 
forced significant cuts to county services. Last year alone, five county-run 
mental health clinics were closed and others lost substantial manpower. 
Existing clinics now have waiting lists of would-be patients. Further proposed 
cuts threaten the closure of 19 more clinics, a move that would leave 27,000 
mental health patients without care, county officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, teams such as Palermo's operated on a 24-hour basis, with 
workers carrying beepers at night. Today, they must allow police untrained in 
handling psychiatric disorders to step in when crises occur after hours. 
</P>
<P>
Q: We hear that the county mental health system has declined significantly. How 
much worse is it now than five or 10 years ago? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's obviously worse in a number of ways. Ten years ago, we didn't have as 
many ethnic communities. Those are growing, which means you need more 
specialized ethnic care. We also had a better budget 10 years ago. Over the 
last four years, the governor has decreased our (county mental health) budget 
by $14 million. You have to add in a 4% to 5% inflation rate during that time. 
Our budget is now at somewhere near a $43-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
We're stretched in more directions than ever. We have a large homeless 
population. If you go out in the streets you can see that. Ten years ago, there 
were more state psychiatric hospital beds. There's a limited number of beds 
now, so that puts more patients out on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it an overstatement to say the mental health system is falling apart? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, I don't think so. If these anticipated (budget) cuts go through and the 
Board of Supervisors does not give us some extra funds, we will not have a 
system. With the cuts it has been estimated that 20,000 of the patients we now 
serve (in Los Angeles County) will lose service. We'll be cut down to 49,000 
clients -- people who receive medication, day treatment, outpatient therapy, 
hospitalization. . . . The rest of those people will go without. A wide variety 
of services are no longer being offered. The system is really just teetering 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
The problem really goes back to the de-institutionalization of mental patients 
in 1959 with the California Community Service Act. That basically said mental 
patients should not be in state hospitals any more. There should be resources 
out in the community to mainstream them back into society -- board-and-care 
homes so they have a place to stay, day treatment programs, vocational 
rehabilitation programs, outpatient medication programs. 
</P>
<P>
It was a beautiful model . . . except for one thing: Along with it there should 
have been mandatory funding to take care of these people. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What kinds of problems do you see here on the streets of Skid Row? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's very sad. What we see downtown are a lot of the homeless -- severely 
mentally ill individuals who basically have no resources to help them. If they 
are not committing a crime, LAPD is not going to be involved with them. 
Particularly now, with the cold weather coming on, a lot of them are out on the 
streets. They're freezing. There are cold weather shelter programs, but a lot 
of them, because of their mental disability, are too paranoid or too gravely 
disabled to try and find those places to keep themselves warm. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do county studies indicate what percentage of the people on Skid Row are 
believed to be mentally ill? 
</P>
<P>
A: Upwards of 33%, or more. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What does your team do in dealing with these people? 
</P>
<P>
A: We go out and do an evaluation. We see what their level of functioning is, 
and if they're competent to make the decision to live on the streets. Can they 
get shelter when they need it? Can they get clothing? Are these people going to 
starve or die or whatever? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they're a little unstable but not enough to require hospitalization; then 
we try to give them alternatives . . . help them get clothing, shelter, that 
kind of stuff. About half the time, we can get them off the streets. Other 
times, no, they don't want to hear about it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What happens with those people? 
</P>
<P>
A: You see them in the medical emergency rooms around here. One example was an 
old woman we dealt with recently living in the area a little west of downtown, 
in the bushes. She was out on the streets and it got too cold for her. She 
ended up with a hypothermic reaction. The police found her; she was almost 
frozen. They took her to Good Samaritan. She got pneumonia. When that starts 
happening, it puts a real financial burden on the ERs. 
</P>
<P>
And others don't make it. Some of them do die, unfortunately. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the drug problem? You hear a lot about the use of street drugs on 
Skid Row. Does that make it more difficult to determine who is mentally ill and 
to decide what kind of treatment they need? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, the drug problem is something we deal with all the time. The first 
thing we want to know when we're screening a person is, 'Is that person using 
any particular kind of drug?' You may have some idea by looking at the eyes. 
Are they constricted? Are they very dilated? Or by looking at the arms. Do they 
have track marks? 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of individuals who, because of their severe depression, use a 
lot of speed. They try to self-medicate. In that type of case it just 
exacerbates the illness. You'll find them out in the street directing traffic, 
or becoming so irritable because of drugs that they threaten other people and 
become almost homicidal. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are very many of the people you see on the streets dangerous? 
</P>
<P>
A: Oh, yes. They say the County Jail is the largest mental institution in the 
country, just about. It's true. A lot of them lose control, have difficulty 
with impulses, and they get into trouble. . . . A lot of these people, if they 
don't get their treatment, they become very paranoid. They feel like somebody's 
going to attack them. Then they will attack first. 
</P>
<P>
That's one of our arguments. If you cut (funding for) mental health . . . 
you're going to have to give the money to county jails; you're sure going to 
have to give it to the courts and you're going to have to beef up LAPD because 
these people do not disappear. They do not go away. They just go somewhere else 
and some other system has to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
These people die, they kill themselves or they kill other people. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How dangerous is the situation for you and your team? 
</P>
<P>
A: We have to be careful all the time. One of the scariest things that happened 
recently was a time when we were going out to evaluate an older man who was 
very unstable and harassing the kids in the neighborhood. Just hours before we 
went out he took a shotgun and just started shooting the windows and the roof 
of the house and LAPD was called. Had we been there it might have been us. . . 
. If there is any doubt about weapons or the possibility of violence we'll call 
the police and have them go along with us. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How much has the mentally ill population of Skid Row grown over the years? 
</P>
<P>
A: Quite a bit. Personally, I cannot walk down the street here without stepping 
over one of them. I can't remember that six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
We found one gentleman a couple weeks ago right near Temple and 3rd streets. He 
was in the bushes with his thumbs in his mouth, filthy, and curled up in a 
fetal position. Well, no one had called us about him. But he was, in our 
estimation, ill enough that he wasn't going to be able to protect himself; he 
wasn't going to be able to find shelter. 
</P>
<P>
There are just so many like that. Sometimes other cities will send their 
mentally ill out here, just put them on a bus. . . . Sometimes people will come 
out here because they have delusions that they're going to be in the movies, or 
that Michael Jackson's calling them. They think they're going to come out here 
because the stars love them and are going to take care of them. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What eventually happened with the gentleman you found at Temple and 3rd? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, the day after we picked him up I went to see him at the hospital and 
he was clean, his hair was washed. We got his name. Most of these people are 
Jane and John Does, but he could tell me his name and where he was born. . . . 
The last I heard they were trying to get him into long-term placement (at a 
board-and-care home). 
</P>
<P>
That kind of gives you a lift.

CITIES REPORT SHARP RISE IN EMERGENCY FOOD, SHELTER PLEAS; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF MAYORS FINDS SITUATION AGGRAVATED BY ECONOMIC 
DOWNTURN AND GROWING PUBLIC INTOLERANCE OF PANHANDLERS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles and 29 other major U.S. cities reported sharp increases this year 
in requests for emergency food assistance and shelter -- troubling figures at a 
time when both the nation's economy and public tolerance for panhandlers are on 
the downswing, the U.S. Conference of Mayors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Requests for emergency food assistance were up 22% from last year and there was 
a 24% increase in requests for emergency shelter, said a conference report on 
"Homelessness and Hunger in America's Cities." 
</P>
<P>
"There is increased hostility to the homeless . . . 80% of the cities reported 
that public sentiment toward the homeless is changing," said Boston Mayor 
Raymond Flynn. "The situation is getting worse, largely and recently because of 
the downturn in the economy." 
</P>
<P>
The report comes just weeks after the Supreme Court let stand an appeals court 
ruling that New York City could ban begging by panhandlers in its subway 
system. The appellate opinion referred to beggars as "intimidating . . . 
threatening . . . and harassing" to the 3.5 million daily commuters on the 
subways. 
</P>
<P>
Growing requests for help are forcing all cities to turn away the homeless, and 
predictions for next year show even tighter budgets and resources, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the percentage of food assistance facilities that had to turn 
people away because of lack of provisions rose to 86%, from 73% last year. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, 14% more families requested emergency food assistance than last 
year but the quantity of food available has decreased, causing 30% of the needy 
to be turned away, the report stated. The report did not translate the 
percentages into numbers of people. 
</P>
<P>
To help solve the problems, Charlotte, N.C., Mayor Sue Myrick called upon 
Congress to appropriate at least $1 billion for the National Affordable Housing 
Act, sponsored by Democratic California Sen. Alan Cranston and Rep. Henry 
Gonzalez (D-Tex.). The legislation, recently signed by President Bush, 
authorizes spending of $27.5 billion for next year. So far, no funds for 
programs that provide funds for first-time home buyers and arrange lower 
interest rates have been earmarked for the act. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn charged that local governments, citizen volunteers and states -- many now 
struggling with ballooning deficits -- are carrying the burden of housing and 
feeding the homeless. Though all cities receive federal grants, the level of 
federal financial support is dwindling, Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Coalition for the Homeless, which released a report 
on the effects of the recession on homelessness last week, federal spending for 
subsidized housing is now about $12 billion annually, compared to $32 billion 
in 1980. There has been a loss of more than 4 million low-income housing units 
since 1970, the coalition contends. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition estimated that there are 3 million homeless people nationwide, 
including more than 100,000 in Los Angeles. The Bureau of Housing and Urban 
Development offers a more conservative national estimate of 600,000 on any 
given night. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Conference of Mayors and advocates for the homeless agreed that 
substance abusers and the mentally ill are the most significant groups in the 
nation's homeless population. Armed forces veterans are also a significant 
portion of the population at 26%, and 24% of the homeless are employed, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
A new study in Los Angeles that was released Wednesday claimed the number of 
homeless in Los Angeles County grew 16.5% in one year. Between 114,000 and 
183,000 people were homeless in the county at some point between July, 1989, 
and June, 1990, according to the Shelter Partnership, a nonprofit support group 
for Los Angeles homeless service agencies. The numbers are substantially higher 
than official county estimates of 30,000 to 50,000 homeless, and the group's 
last estimate of between 100,000 and 160,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Shelter Partnership has undertaken these estimates to help advise public 
policy makers and the general public of the magnitude and trends of the problem 
in Los Angeles County," executive director Ruth Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
Some county officials, however, said they were skeptical. County statistics for 
homeless assistance on which the study was based include an unknown number of 
duplications because many homeless apply for relief several times in a year, 
Paul Fast, Department of Public Social Services research director, said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : PANEL TOLD TO RECONSIDER LICENSE OF 
DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ruled that the California Coastal 
Commission erred in revoking the license of a Malibu developer accused of 
grading 14 times the amount of earth his permit allowed, and must reconsider 
the matter. Although it is a victory for developer Sheldon Gordon, Judge David 
P. Yaffe's decision may have little impact on Gordon's proposal to build four 
luxury homes in Malibu's exclusive Sweetwater Mesa area because it leaves the 
future of the controversial project up to the commission to decide. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Atty. Gen. Steven H. Kaufmann said the ruling represents "a Pyrrhic 
victory at best." "In determining that, for technical reasons, the commission 
may have acted inappropriately, the judge's decision does not remove the fact 
that Mr. Gordon still faces the commission's judgment as to whether revocation 
should occur," Kaufmann said.

An autopsy on Wednesday determined that a newborn girl found dead in a trash 
can behind her teen-age mother's Glendora home had been born alive, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Coroner's officials, however, have not yet determined the cause of death for 
the 8 1/2-pound infant and no arrests have been made, said Sgt. Tim Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
He said the child was born Monday to a 17-year-old Glendora High School student 
who hid her pregnancy from friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the mother was rushed unconscious to Foothill Presbyterian 
Hospital, where emergency room doctors determined that she had recently given 
birth. She was in serious but stable condition Wednesday, police said. The baby 
was found wrapped in a plastic bag, its umbilical cord still attached. Pfeiffer 
said the mother told police she thought the infant had been born dead.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : HAYDEN SAYS HE WILL HEAD ASSEMBLY 
EDUCATION PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) said on Wednesday that when the 
Legislature reconvenes next month, he will become the chairman of a new 
Assembly Higher Education Committee. As a result, Hayden will give up the 
chairmanship of the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) would not 
comment on Hayden's announcement. Brown is expected to announce new committee 
assignments next month. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent committee switch comes amid reports that Brown is being pressured 
to strip Hayden of the labor post as punishment for several supposed political 
sins. These include his championing of "Big Green," the sweeping environmental 
initiative voters rejected last month. Hayden dismissed suggestions that he was 
being punished, but acknowledged that his "Big Green" leadership role "may have 
ruffled some feathers" in the Legislature.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : AQUATIC CENTER'S FEES ASSAILED AS 
EXCLUSIONARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High fees and a "country club" atmosphere effectively exclude minorities from 
the new $6.5-million Rose Bowl Aquatic Center, the head of the Pasadena NAACP 
charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not faced with the blatant racism of old," said John Kennedy of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
"The means of exclusion have changed but the end result is the same: 
exclusivity." 
</P>
<P>
Critics said only one of the three pools at the center is shallow, allowing for 
recreation by nonswimmers, and the cost of lessons -- $45 for three weeks -- is 
too high for many poor residents of Northwest Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The aquatic center, which opened in June, is run by the nonprofit Amateur 
Athletic Foundation. Board member Bill Bogaard disputed the allegations of 
exclusivity, saying that more than 13,000 youngsters, many of them minorities, 
used the pools this summer.

MORNINGSIDE HIGH QUICKLY ADAPTS TO LIFE WITHOUT LISA; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: WITH PLENTY OF DEPTH AND A BALANCED ATTACK, THE MONARCHS ARE OFF TO 
A FAST START. 
</P>

<P>
Ron Randle has been shouting himself hoarse the past few weeks as the 
Morningside High girls' basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have no voice come Friday," he said. "I get better quickly, though." 
</P>
<P>
As well he should. After three weeks of yelling instruction, admonishment and 
encouragement, Randle has guided the Lady Monarchs to a 5-0 record going into 
last night's game against Hanford. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside is currently playing in the Santa Barbara Tournament of Champions 
-- traditionally one of the premier girls' tournaments in the nation -- which 
concludes with the championship game Saturday at 8 p.m. at Santa Barbara High. 
</P>
<P>
Expect Randle's voice to be raw at the end of it, although the Monarchs could 
find themselves with their second tournament championship of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The host Monarchs swept to the title of the Morningside tournament last week, 
defeating Lynwood in the championship game, 69-61. Morningside did it with a 
balanced attack that featured key contributions from several players. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Randle is blessed with a gifted group of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, much of the speculation surrounding Morningside this season has focused 
mostly on what the Monarchs don't have. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, they no longer have schoolgirl legend Lisa Leslie, the 6-foot-5 
prodigy who scored 104 points in a half, set national scoring records and 
dunked several times in her high school career. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Leslie became the most sought-after prep female basketball player 
in the nation since Cheryl Miller. She is now at USC, Miller's alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
Which is also where longtime Morningside coach Frank Scott is now, as well, 
after 10 seasons and as many league championships, including three consecutive 
CIF titles and a pair of Division I state titles in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Scott is an assistant to USC Coach Marianne Stanley. Randle, a veteran of seven 
seasons of co-coaching the Monarchs' boys team along with Carl Franklin, took 
over for Scott. 
</P>
<P>
The Morningside boys were either Ocean or Pioneer League champions in six of 
Randle's seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But Randle is still adjusting to his new duties. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a different type of challenge," Randle said. "Basketball is basketball. 
But I'm still trying to find out how Frank Scott did it." 
</P>
<P>
Hence the hoarseness. 
</P>
<P>
There have also been adjustments for the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little more vocal as far as bench decorum than Coach Scott was," Randle 
said. "It's important not to be overbearing, but still get my points across. 
But it's tough for the players to make the transition from a quiet person to a 
screamer." 
</P>
<P>
One thing the Monarchs don't have to learn is up-tempo basketball. Randle's 
Morningside team is playing intense pressure defense and fast-breaking offense 
just like Scott's teams did. 
</P>
<P>
"Quickness, agility and fundamentals," Randle said in listing qualities that 
seem inherent in Morningside players. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs are winning with a deep roster and a rotation that would be the 
envy of most coaches. 
</P>
<P>
In the pivot for Morningside is 6-4 center Janet Davis, a talented junior who 
spent her first two seasons in Leslie's shadow. She is averaging 18 points, 11 
rebounds and six blocked shots per game. 
</P>
<P>
Randle has several choices alongside Davis in the front court, including 5-10 
senior forward Akiba Flanagan, who is averaging 8.5 points, nine rebounds and 
four steals, 5-9 swing forward Tyesha Whiting, defensive specialist Jakeena 
Bacon, and 6-2 sophomore Tina Thompson, who is averaging 12 points in a reserve 
role. 
</P>
<P>
The backcourt is just as deep, with guards Sherell Young, a 5-5 junior who is 
averaging seven points and 11 assists, and senior Princess Murray, who is 
averaging 10 points, leading the way. The multi-talented Murray has already 
signed a letter of intent with Loyola Marymount. Randle also has a gifted 5-10 
freshman guard in Temika Kirby. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs' deep bench includes guards Melinda Cook and Kalesha Prewitt and 
forwards Terri McKinney and Angela Collins. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got 12 players and I play them all," Randle said. 
</P>
<P>
Distributing adequate playing time among the Monarchs has been one of Randle's 
most difficult tasks. 
</P>
<P>
The chore of trying to replace Leslie has been an easier one, however. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't replace a person like Lisa Leslie," Randle said. "No one player can 
step into the shoes of Lisa Leslie. Instead, we've tried to absorb parts of 
Lisa's game into different players." 
</P>
<P>
Hence Davis' blocks, Flanagan's rebounds and Thompson's scoring off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"It has created an atmosphere where every young lady is anxious to get into the 
ballgame and do her part," Randle said. 
</P>
<P>
So Morningside keeps rolling along. 
</P>
<P>
And Randle, who was a reserve guard on the 1973 Morningside team that went 30-1 
in Coach Jim Harrick's final season at the school, keeps shouting. 
</P>
<P>
But he remembers several philosophies that Harrick, now the UCLA coach, left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no 'I' in 'we,' " Randle said. "We're trying to develop the 'we.' "

BOSCO TECH TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
LANCERS FALL AFTER SHOTS DON'T, 82-76 
</P>

Chris Loll rolled toward the hoop on a breakaway in the first quarter of 
Thousand Oaks High's championship quarterfinal game of the Bosco Tech 
tournament Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Cruising toward the basket down the left flank, the 6-foot-5 forward cocked the 
ball in his left hand as he considered whether he wanted to attempt a dunk or 
kiss the ball off the glass. 
</P>
<P>
His indecision forced him to settle for something in between, a half-dash dunk 
that barely crawled over the lip of the rim and rattled through. 
</P>
<P>
There would be darn few good rolls for Loll or Thousand Oaks thereafter, 
however, as the Lancers were held to a season-low point total in an 82-76 loss 
to Downey at Bosco Tech High in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely wasn't pretty when we shot the ball," Thousand Oaks Coach Ed 
Chevalier said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (4-1) will face Hoover tonight at 8:30 in a fifth-place 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers, who entered the game averaging 89.5 points a game, jumped to a 
19-8 lead after one quarter. From then on, though, Downey offered no quarter 
and the Lancers couldn't heave a dime in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the shooting was the problem, Chevalier said as he perused a rather 
sobering team statistics sheet. "And it was a collective effort." 
</P>
<P>
Other than Loll, who came within one point of his season average by scoring a 
game-high 25 points, Thousand Oaks threw up a thousand bricks. The Lancers made 
just 28 of 73 field-goal attempts (38.3%) and were held to one field goal over 
the first 5 minutes 38 seconds of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks led, 37-31, at halftime before Downey's tandem of Ron Brown and 
Stieve Boyd took over. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a 6-foot-3, 255-pound forward who definitely will not be confused with 
the National Football League speedster of the same name, scored a team-high 22 
points off the bench for Downey (5-2), including 14 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Their big guys took over and ours didn't respond," Chevalier said. "Our inside 
play is crucial to any success we're going to have." 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks starting center Dusty Lysobey had 11 points and reserve center 
Shane Graham had three. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their big guys came to play," Loll said. 
</P>
<P>
Ditto the little dudes. 
</P>
<P>
Downey made a head-spinning 21 of 29 shots (72.4%) from the field in the second 
half and quickly pulled even. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings scored on nine of their first 11 field-goal attempts after halftime 
and took a 49-48 lead with 3:15 left in the third quarter. Boyd, a 5-11 guard, 
scored 10 of his 18 points in the third quarter, which ended with Downey 
holding a 55-54 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth quarter was misery in microcosm for Thousand Oaks, which was 
outscored, 9-1, before the Lancers called a timeout with 5:52 to play. 
</P>
<P>
The T.O. T.O. didn't help sway the momentum a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"As the game went on, Downey started to gain confidence," Chevalier said. "And 
we lost ours." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers didn't score from the field in the quarter until Andrew Borg scored 
on a layin with 4:05 left to bring Thousand Oaks within 68-60. 
</P>
<P>
Borg and backcourt mate Brian Capella, who entered the game averaging 10.3 and 
14.8 points, were held to five and seven points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks resorted to fouling as the game wore down and closed to within 
76-70 when Loll scored inside with 1:02 left. Downey's Mark Rand made both ends 
of a one-and-one opportunity with one minute left to give the Vikings an 
eight-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In other quarterfinal games: 
</P>
<P>
Burbank 65, West Torrance 57 (2 OTs) -- Jon Warner scored a team-high 19 points 
to lead Burbank (4-4) into a semifinal-round game Friday night at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank will play the winner of today's game between Eagle Rock and El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
With 19 seconds left in the second overtime, Burbank's Spencer Klocki made both 
ends of a one-and-one opportunity to give Burbank a 63-55 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Palaski scored 18 points for Burbank and made five of seven free throws in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Poly 71, Hoover 47 -- Junior center Gabe Alvarado had 17 points to 
lead the Tornadoes. Ten of his points came in the first half and helped Hoover 
to a 27-23 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
But Long Beach Poly tied the score at the start of the second half and broke 
open the game midway through the third quarter with an 11-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover's strategy of packing five players into the key and begging Poly (7-2) 
to shoot from the outside worked -- for half the game. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover led by four at halftime as Poly was ice cold from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, however, Poly poured it on and poured it in. The 
Jackrabbits outscored Hoover, 20-6, in the first six minutes of the third 
quarter and led, 47-36, entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Poly's third-quarter run was led by Tyus Edney, a 5-11 senior point guard who 
has signed a letter of intent to play next season at UCLA. Edney scored nine of 
his team-high 18 points in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard Dave Ulloa added 11 points for Hoover.

CALABASAS' SCHLOM RIDING HIGH IN THE SADDLE; 
</P>
<P>
EQUESTRIAN: A VIRTUAL ROOKIE AT AGE 20, SHE ASCENDS INTO THE SHOW-JUMPING 
STRATOSPHERE AFTER ONE SPECTACULAR YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
When the dust settled at the recent Nation's Cup show-jumping competition in 
Toronto, only two riders had been able to finish with three clean rounds. One 
was two-time World Cup Final champion Ian Millar, a Canadian riding the 
legendary Big Ben. The other was Candice Schlom, the youngest member of the U. 
S. national team, unproven, unknown . . . unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
"The 20-year-old from Calabasas may have won over the world," raved the 
California Horsetrader, a bimonthly newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Ike, director of show jumping for the U. S. Equestrian Team, was equally 
impressed. "Being in the same company with Ian Millar is indicative of 
Candice's strengths," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schlom's overall performance in Toronto -- she led the U. S. team to second 
place behind Canada and also finished second in a $100,000 individual event -- 
catapulted her into show-jumping's fast lane and highlighted a transcendent 
year. Starting out as a virtual rookie, she earned more than $100,000 in prize 
money, won her first World Cup Grand Prix event and made her first national 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason she can't go all the way to the top," said Bill Cooney, who 
helped train Schlom as a junior. "She's got great style and great talent." 
</P>
<P>
And great fortune. Schlom's upward mobility was given a giant boost by her 
cousin, Calabasas developer Larry Dinovitz. A year ago, Dinovitz became her 
sponsor, bought her a high-priced Dutch thoroughbred and put her in charge of 
his 100-acre Calabasas horse farm, Rancho del Puma. Without him, she might have 
spent years getting to the level she's at now, but Dinovitz doesn't doubt that 
she would have succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a tremendous athlete and she's totally dedicated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is another component in Schlom's overnight success, a 10-year-old mare 
named Wula (pronounced VOO-luh). In show jumping, as with most horse-related 
activities, the animal is a major factor -- as much as 90%, experts say -- in 
the success of the rider. But victories are not assured by merely paying six 
figures for a mature, talented horse. The trick is picking the right horse, 
then bonding with it. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, Dinovitz sent Schlom to Switzerland and gave her only two days 
to find a horse. The first day, nothing. Then she saw Wula and looked into her 
big brown eyes. "You can see a lot in a horse's eyes," Schlom said. "You can 
tell if it's bright and alert and has athletic ability, concentration and 
attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Wula passed the eye exam, then Schlom got in the saddle and took a test ride. 
"She was wonderful," Schlom said. She also identified with the horse. "She'd 
only been in two or three international competitions. We were at the same level 
of experience." 
</P>
<P>
Wula was flown to the United States, then kept in quarantine for six weeks 
before Schlom was able to take her home on New Year's Day. Their symbiosis was 
almost immediate. "I feel we're one," she said, "two minds working together to 
challenge the course. We've got that rapport." 
</P>
<P>
Schlom's ascent into the show-jumping stratosphere might seem sudden but it was 
the result of years of hard work -- 10 or 12 hours a day, six days a week -- 
and intense involvement with horses. Her parents, Al and Marlo, kept horses at 
their home in Sunland and showed cutting horses. At 3, Candice began riding 
western horses and showing them, but by the time she was 7, she was bored and 
switched to show jumping, which she loved from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Training under such well-known West Coast trainers as Hap Hansen, Susie 
Hutchinson and Jimmy Williams, Schlom competed as a junior in top-level events. 
Show jumping consumed her life. She didn't attend high school, preferring to 
take correspondence courses. At 15, she and her mother moved to North Salem, N. 
Y., living in a camper for two years while Candice trained at Beacon Hill Show 
Stables under Cooney and Frank Madden. 
</P>
<P>
"I was extremely lucky to have such supportive parents," Schlom said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooney and Madden took Schlom to competitions in Europe and encouraged her to 
ride on the Florida winter circuit. But her education wasn't limited to riding. 
She learned the horse business from the bottom up, from cleaning barns to 
managing a stable, which gave her the necessary knowledge to run Dinovitz's 
ambitious operation. 
</P>
<P>
Today, she trains 16 horses at Rancho del Puma and has two students. Her junior 
rider, Kelly Lobach of Calabasas, was on the championship team in the Young 
Riders competition earlier this year in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought Candice would have a significant input in the business," said 
Cooney, who has moved his stables to Colt's Neck. N. J. "She can give a lot to 
any horse or rider." 
</P>
<P>
When Candice was growing up, it would have been logical to assume that her 
half-brother, Todd Dellutri, would be the one to have a money-making athletic 
career. He was a football player, an All-Southern Section wide receiver at 
Burroughs High, and Candice only rode horses, a pursuit that usually doesn't 
pay off unless you're a jockey. 
</P>
<P>
But Todd suffered a career-ending knee injury and is now an assistant football 
coach at Burroughs. Candice developed her skills in the most lucrative of all 
horse-related activities outside of racing. 
</P>
<P>
Show jumping draws big crowds, attracts major sponsors and offers big prizes. 
Since she acquired Wula, Schlom has won more than $100,000 for Larry and Connie 
Dinovitz, who pay her a salary for running Rancho del Puma so that she can 
retain her amateur status. 
</P>
<P>
It was the money that got her a berth on the U. S. national team for the 
Nation's Cup. For the first and, probably, only time, the USET selected the 
four team members on the basis of money won during the first nine months of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a strictly objective process," Ike said, adding that the 1992 
Olympic team -- Schlom's ultimate goal -- will be chosen through traditional 
qualifying trials. 
</P>
<P>
Schlom foreshadowed her Toronto performance by winning her first grand prix, 
the Aid to Zoo competition last spring on the Arizona circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a major breakthrough for me," said Schlom, who finished the six-week 
circuit as overall champion despite suffering a broken nose and a cracked rib 
in falls. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Schlom hopes to compete in the Pan American Games -- if the United 
States decides to send a team to Cuba -- and the World Cup in Sweden. But she 
will not soon forget the thrill of wearing her country's red coat for the first 
time. Well, almost the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 12, I wore a red coat (in a competition,)" she said, "but when I 
found out it was the U. S. coat, I told my mom to sell it. I decided I wouldn't 
wear a red coat again until I was on the national team."

FISHING: VETERAN ANGLER FINDS SUCCESS USING AN OLD FAVORITE FOR BAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Don Christiansen of Wilmington, known as "Crabbie," to his friends, still uses 
sand crabs for bait. 
</P>
<P>
Sand crabs don't seem to be in demand any more, although they were once popular 
among surf fishermen for catching halibut. Because live squid, anchovies and 
sardines are in plentiful supply, sand crabs have fallen from favor with all 
but veteran fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Christiansen, 62, insists anglers fishing from small boats could make excellent 
use of sand crabs. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran fisherman catches his own bait, too, digging up sand crabs about 
the size of a half-dollar from South Bay beaches. In preparing the line, 
Christiansen said to run the hook through either side of the sand crab's shell. 
This allows the crab to stay alive for a long time while it is dropped to the 
bottom in search of a hungry halibut. He has hooked halibut up to 25 pounds 
with this method. 
</P>
<P>
"I have several South Bay spots with sandy bottoms and I try to stay out of the 
areas where I know the sand sharks and bat rays are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Christiansen said he has never entered local halibut contests, but he is 
considering doing so next year, using a bucket of choice sand crabs for bait. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches -- George Sandbal of West L.A., fishing aboard the Spitfire 
in Santa Monica Bay, snagged the whopper of the week, a 37-pound halibut caught 
with a squid-baited hook. 
</P>
<P>
John Ito of Carson, fishing San Clemente Island aboard the Diawa, caught a 31 
1/2-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Long of Lomita, fishing Santa Monica Bay in his boat, Fishin' Toy, caught 
a 20-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Bethel of West L.A. was aboard the Happyman in Santa Monica Bay when she 
landed a 19 1/2-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Hiser of Gardena, fishing aboard the Shogun at San Clemente Island, 
caught a 15-pound sheephead. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay anglers scored again fishing for yellowtail at Catalina Island. 
Despite some adverse weather conditions, the water temperature averaged 64 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronado, out of Long Beach Sportfishing, bagged 58 yellowtail on the 
backside of the island on Friday. Bill Bellman of Torrance won the jackpot with 
a 29-pounder. Floyd Linnen of Redondo Beach and Bill Haynes of Long Beach each 
caught six yellowtail. West Los Angeles-area anglers who caught four or more 
yellowtails include Tak Endo, Mark Gaslich and Bob Santo. 
</P>
<P>
Fish reports -- The local surface bite has slowed but halibut fishing is 
improving. At outer islands there is excellent fishing for bass and rockfish 
mixed with some yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing, the Spitfire fished the bay with success, 
catching 105 sand bass, 20 calico bass, seven trigger fish and three halibut. 
The Happyman, on a half-day trip, returned with 25 sand bass and two halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Spray of Redondo Sportfishing fished Redondo Canyon and anglers sacked 
100 rockfish, 30 bonito, three halibut and a sole. The Blackjack worked San 
Clemente Island for 200 calico bass, 101 blue perch, 60 sheephead and 50 
rockfish. The Redondo Special, on a half-day trip, returned with 132 rockfish. 
</P>
<P>
At 22nd St. Landing, the First String fished Catalina Island and found a good 
perch bite. Anglers caught 181, plus 27 sheephead and 21 calico bass. The New 
Image went on a rock cod trip to Santa Barbara Island and returned with a catch 
of 375. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun out of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing fished San Clemente Island and 
returned with 230 calico bass, 190 rockfish and 150 blue perch. The Matt Walsh, 
on a half-day trip, returned with 33 calico bass, 26 blue perch and 17 
whitefish. 
</P>
<P>
At Long Beach Sportfishing, the Victory fished Rocky Point and anglers caught 
157 calico bass, 26 rockfish, 22 bonito and 10 sheephead. The Southern Cal 
returned from a half-day trip with 60 calico bass, 13 bonito and four halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Freshwater Notes -- Fishing at Pyramid Lake, Bob Hanley of Westchester caught 
two stripers, both about 21 pounds. Eleven-year-old Joe Unibe of Long Beach, 
using 12-pound test line, caught a 29-pound catfish.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: HOW TO RING IN THE NEW YEAR IN SAN 
DIEGO IN A JAZZY WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just one more week of jazz remains in 1990, but there's still time to wring out 
the final few notes, especially New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest Dec. 31 bash will be KIFM's sixth Lites Out Jazz New Year's Eve at 
the Catamaran and Bahia hotels and on boats cruising Mission Bay between them. 
</P>
<P>
Spyro Gyra, Ronnie Laws and Tim Weisberg are this year's headliners, with 
support from locals Hollis Gentry, Fattburger, Forecast, Colours, Dr. Chico's 
Island Sounds, Peter Robberecht and Randy Beecher. 
</P>
<P>
A $75 ticket admits you to performances by Spyro Gyra and one of the other 
headliners; $55 gets you Spyro Gyra and local bands; $50 buys either Laws or 
Weisberg, plus locals. If these tickets don't sell out, less expensive ones 
will be available to let you hear the locals only. All tickets include party 
favors plus a champagne toast at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Spyro Gyra has a new album and a new billing -- "Spyro Gyra featuring Jay 
Beckenstein," the group's saxophonist and one of its original members. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, the name was my decision, not a band decision," Beckenstein said. 
"It's not that my involvement has increased; it has always been essential to 
what the band has done." 
</P>
<P>
Band members Dave Samuels (vibes and marimba) and Tom Schuman (keyboards) 
launched solo careers as a result of Spyro Gyra. Since Beckenstein writes, by 
his own estimate, roughly half the group's material, produces their albums and 
uses the band as his sole musical outlet, he felt justified taking more credit. 
</P>
<P>
The new album, "Fast Forward," ranges from Latin rhythms, to the funk-rock 
Miles Davis tribute "4MD" featuring guest Dave Beal's on Miles-like muted 
trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
Beckenstein plays tenor on the album for the first time in years, in addition 
to soprano and alto saxes. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I pick up a tenor and start fooling around, I start hearing Stan 
Getz and John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins," Beckenstein said. "The material I 
wrote for tenor was somewhat evocative of those people. 'Shadow Play,' for 
example, is very 'Trane-inspired." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, saxophonist Laws is pleased with his new album "Identity." 
</P>
<P>
"In my heart, I feel it's one of my strongest ever," said the brother of jazz 
flutist Hubert and singers Eloise and Debra, with whom he plans to record a 
first-ever family album next year. 
</P>
<P>
Like George Benson, Laws moved into singing in the 1980s, and he sings two 
songs on "Identity," including the single "Morning in My Life," dedicated to 
his wife of 20 years, Karmen. 
</P>
<P>
Flutist Weisberg's last album, "Outrageous Temptations," released last year, 
teamed him with David Benoit, Russ Freeman and other light jazz mainstays, with 
a slick but uninspired result. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's Lites Out party drew 2,000, and 2,500 are expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
At Elario's, Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham and their Sweet Baby Blues Band will 
close out the year after playing there for the first time last spring. They 
play nightly from Friday through New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
The group will play several songs from its new "Luv in the Afternoon" album, 
which features blues guitarist Clarence (Gatemouth) Brown; however, Brown won't 
be on hand New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Shows are at 8:30 and 10:30 Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday, and at 9, 10:30 and 
midnight Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the New Year's Eve shows comes with a $75 dinner package. Call 
459-0541 for reservations or information. 
</P>
<P>
At the San Diego Princess Hotel on Mission Bay, the complex polyrhythms of 
Afro-Brazilian music will greet fans with "New Year's Eve in Rio 1990." The 
bash features Lula and Afro Brasil, a dance-and-music troupe. Bahian vocalist 
and master percussionist Lula Almeida was one of the founders of Olodum, the 
Brazilian group that backs Paul Simon on his new album, "The Rhythm of the 
Saints." 
</P>
<P>
Since moving to Los Angeles in 1986, Almeida has introduced Americans to a 
variety of Afro-Brazilian sounds, most recently through his 18-month-old group 
Afro Brasil. The band opened for Hugh Masekela in front of 2,000 people at an 
Afro-Caribbean festival in San Antonio last month. Tickets for a New Year's Eve 
package are $50. Information: 222-6911.

MCNIGHT STRUTS HER STUFF AT THE CINEGRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a little bit of Sophie Tucker in singer/comedienne Sharon McNight. And 
maybe a trace or two of Bette Midler, Hermione Gingold and Bernadette Peters. 
It's quite a combination. 
</P>
<P>
But the most important element in her style, as McNight's opening set at the 
Cinegrill on Tuesday made clear, is her own fanciful mixture of off-the-wall 
humor, sensitive lyric interpretation and big-time belting. 
</P>
<P>
McNight, who received a 1989 Tony nomination for her role in "Starmites," sang 
a collection of tunes carefully programmed to keep her audience off balance. A 
bold, brassy strut through "Broadway Baby" was followed by a more reserved "In 
the Meantime." Then, what seemed at first to be a Midleresque reading of "You 
Are the Wind Beneath My Wings" became a devastatingly sardonic variation called 
"You Are Contempt Beneath My Feet." 
</P>
<P>
McNight, who was superbly accompanied by pianist/vocalist James Followell, 
shifted gears again with a coolly straightforward interpretation of "Say It 
Isn't So" and a touching performance of a new song, "Picture in the Home." 
</P>
<P>
Then it was off to the races, as she sang, acted, mugged and danced her way 
through a uniquely personal rendition of the entire opening Oz section from the 
"Wizard of Oz." Switching voices wildly from Judy Garland to Billie Burke, from 
Margaret Hamilton to a whole array of Munchkins, McNight was non-stop motion, a 
one-woman show that managed to have fun and add a satiric touch or two without 
diminishing or belittling a classic piece of film music. 
</P>
<P>
McNight wrapped up the program with a continuously fascinating mixed bag of 
material -- from the Doors to Gershwin. Never at a loss for a quip, a fast line 
or a comeback, her first-rate vocal skills ready to handle the most 
far-reaching demands, she was the complete cabaret artist -- and one who 
deserves to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon McNight: The Cinegrill at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, 7000 Hollywood 
Blvd., Hollywood. Today through Saturday and Dec. 26-29. (213) 466-7000 or 
Ticketmaster. DON HECKMAN

EMPTY POST OFFICE IS CUSTOMERS' DELIGHT;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Evelyn Nurse arrived recently at the crowded downtown post office and waited 20 
minutes to buy Christmas stamps, only to be told by a clerk to take a number 
and wait some more. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst line I've ever seen," Nurse said angrily before stomping out 
of the lobby. "If I take a number, I'll be here for an hour." 
</P>
<P>
Less than a mile away in the World Trade Center, there's a new post office 
branch where she probably could have walked up to the counter and bought stamps 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
There, amid white walls covered with art and expansive tiled floors, three 
clerks with time on their hands chat amiably. They say they know most of their 
customers by name. 
</P>
<P>
One of the customers, Leslie Calkins, works at a nearby construction site and 
comes by regularly to pick up her company's mail. "It's great here," Calkins 
said. "I like it because it's always deserted." 
</P>
<P>
The same thing that makes customers such as Calkins happy, however, is causing 
concern for postal officials. Four months after opening, the sleek new post 
office -- the city's first new one in eight years -- is drawing far fewer 
customers than expected and costing the government money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's being under-utilized," said Terri Bouffiou, communications manager for 
the U.S. Postal Service's Long Beach division. Mary Cornelious, superintendent 
of window services at the new Trade Center Station, added: "I thought we'd be a 
little busier by now. Personally, I don't like idle time." 
</P>
<P>
Bouffiou said officials decided to build the new post office at the World Trade 
Center on Ocean Boulevard in part to attract customers from the surrounding 
high-rise buildings and siphon off some of the business from the nearby 
downtown branch on Long Beach Boulevard. In recent years that office -- which 
has served area customers since 1933 -- has been so crowded, she said, that 
postal officials established a system under which customers take numbers and 
wait as long as 30 minutes to be served. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the plan hasn't worked. Although the old branch continues to 
attract an average of 1,400 customers a day, postal officials say, the new one 
serves only 50 to 60. And while every other postal facility in the city has a 
waiting list for post office boxes, she said, only 130 of the 2,000 boxes at 
the new office have been rented since it opened on Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Business has picked up at the new station in recent weeks because of the 
Christmas mailing, but it still falls far short of capacity, Cornelious said. 
"People just don't know that we're here," she said. "It's hard to get them to 
change old habits." 
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the post office cannot be seen from the street and that 
the World Trade Center's management prohibits signs outside to call attention 
to the new branch. She added that not everyone is aware of the parking 
available beneath the building. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, we started selling each other stamps just to get some money coming 
in," she quipped. Neither Cornelious nor Bouffiou will reveal how much money 
the new facility is losing, except to say that the rent far exceeds the 
revenues the office has generated through the sale of stamps and other 
services. While post offices are not for-profit institutions, Bouffiou said, 
postal officials generally prefer that they at least break even. 
</P>
<P>
But Bouffiou says she hasn't given up on the new site. "I think it's a good 
location," she said. "This is part of the downtown retail area." 
</P>
<P>
Cornelious is convinced that business will pick up once the World Trade Center, 
which opened last year, is fully occupied and other office high-rises planned 
in the area become realities. "The numbers are slowly increasing," she said. 
"In the long run we will succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the facility's current regulars are particularly eager for that to 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to keep it a secret," said Maria Herbert, an administrative 
secretary in the building. "Usually I just walk right up to the window." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jack Wilson, another regular: "This is the lull before the storm. Most of 
the neighborhood doesn't know that it's here yet, but good things don't last 
forever."

PROTESTS FAIL TO PREVENT BELL GARDENS ZONE CHANGE; 
</P>
<P>
PLANNING: NEARLY ONE-THIRD OF THE CITY'S 9,000 PROPERTIES WILL BE REZONED. THE 
PLAN WILL NOT GO INTO EFFECT FOR AT LEAST 20 YEARS.

BELL GARDENS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial zoning plan that will change the face of the city was adopted 
by the City Council despite the fierce objections of more than 600 residents 
and an impassioned plea by a state senator. 
</P>
<P>
After a rowdy six-hour meeting marked by several heated exchanges between some 
City Council members and Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), the council Monday 
night voted unanimously to approve the new zoning law. City leaders said the 
new plan will reduce the city's crushing population density and eradicate the 
hodgepodge of commercial, residential and industrial neighborhoods. Later, 
Torres accused council members of "shattering the American dream." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly one-third of the city's 9,000 properties will be rezoned. In some cases, 
businesses will be forced to move from neighborhoods that have been designated 
industrial or residential districts, and in others, residents will have to move 
to make way for new commercial or industrial districts, or reduce the number of 
apartments on their lots. 
</P>
<P>
The plan will not go into effect for at least 20 years and in some cases not 
for another 35 years or when the property is sold, whichever is longest. City 
Manager Claude Booker said that an estimated 500 people may be forced to move 
when the zoning law goes into effect. Critics said he has grossly 
underestimated the number of people who will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
"Not one house, not one apartment, not one tenant will be disturbed for the 
next 20 years," Booker told the heckling crowd. Hundreds of residents who could 
not crowd into the Ross Hall auditorium listened to the meeting outside. 
</P>
<P>
"Mentiras, mentiras," meaning "lies, lies," the largely Latino crowd shouted in 
reply. 
</P>
<P>
Community activists, who arranged a protest march before the meeting, said they 
plan to launch a campaign to recall the entire council. 
</P>
<P>
"They had this figured out from the start," said Rudy Garcia, director of the 
Bell office of the League of United Latin American Citizens. "There was no way 
that they would change their minds. They're not being sensitive to the needs of 
the community. The people very clearly told them that we don't want the 
rezoning and they couldn't care less. So who is working for whom?" 
</P>
<P>
City leaders have repeatedly told residents that the zoning change is necessary 
because the city's infrastructure, its sewer and water systems, cannot tolerate 
for long the stress of 42,000 people living in the 2.4-square-mile city. Quite 
simply, city leaders said, there are too many people in Bell Gardens, and the 
uncontrolled development has manifested itself in poor housing, a double-digit 
dropout rate in overcrowded area high schools, gangs, property damage and 
increasing costs for municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the residents who attended the meeting said that there are other 
options besides such a sweeping rezoning plan to correct the city's problems. 
They complained that they have worked hard for their property, and that the 
city should not be allowed to pass laws that will adversely affect property 
values, or will force residents to move without compensation. 
</P>
<P>
"(The people here) have crossed rivers, they have crawled under fences to get 
here," one resident told the council. "They have a dream and they are not going 
to let you take it away from them." 
</P>
<P>
Torres and many of the residents who spoke made much of the fact that Bell 
Gardens' population is now about 85% Latino, yet no one on the City Council or 
in the city's administration is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Torres told the council that the community needs to organize better "to make 
sure people that look like me are sitting up there." He said later that if a 
Latino were sitting on the council, city leaders would change their 
decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
"Not enough people have been given equal input," he said. "What you see here is 
anger and frustration because people feel that they are being left out." 
</P>
<P>
Many residents accused the council members of discrimination, and said they are 
people with "small heads and big pockets" who stand to gain financially from 
the new zoning ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"They (City Council members) are ready to get rid of all Bell Gardens 
residents, and after they do this by rezoning and lowering the price of all 
land to zero, they will turn around and buy it. . . . They will become the 
richest public officials in the history of Southern California," stated a flyer 
circulated throughout the community. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Booker told residents that they had been the victims of 
misinformation by people who want to divide the community. 
</P>
<P>
All five council members own property that will be governed by the new zoning 
law, and three of them will be prevented from adding more units to their 
properties. None will be forced to move. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to admit that some people are going to be hurt in the deal sooner or 
later, but it is something that will be better for the city in the long run," 
Mayor Pro Tem Robert Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham is one of the three whose property will be affected by the zoning 
change. Once the new map goes into effect, he will no longer be able to develop 
more than two units on his land. Today, he could build as many as three. All 
council members disqualified themselves from voting on any portion of the map 
which affects property they own. 
</P>
<P>
Both Cunningham and Booker criticized Sen. Torres, saying that he was 
exploiting the controversial issue to further his political career. Torres is 
one of four candidates running for county supervisor in the district that 
includes Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"He is using this as a political platform. That is a cheap trick," Booker 
shouted during the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad you came out of the woodwork, Mr. Booker, and let people know who you 
really are," Torres bristled. 
</P>
<P>
Torres accused the city staff of trying to rush the project through without 
doing a full environmental impact report and angrily told Booker, "Read the 
law, Mr. Booker. Read the law." 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Torres said he was "very disturbed" by the council's action and 
its attitude, which he labeled "arrogant." 
</P>
<P>
Booker called Torres' behavior "vulgar." 
</P>
<P>
"He knows nothing about this issue," Booker said. "He came in here shooting 
from the hip." 
</P>
<P>
Torres' staff never met with city staff to go over the zoning ordinance. Booker 
said that three hours before the council meeting he received a telephone call 
from a Torres aide asking for a quick written summary.

HARBOR REPORTS CONTINUING RISE IN REVENUE, TONNAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Harbor Department's latest financial report shows that its 
operating revenues, net income and cargo tonnage increased during fiscal 1990, 
continuing a port boom that began in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But in presenting the report to the Harbor Commission, port officials cautioned 
that the nation's busiest harbor will likely see its business taper off as a 
result of the country's slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Our growth rate has been extraordinary . . . and I just can't believe that 
with the state of the economy and all the other indicators, we will see the 
sort of growth we have seen in the past," said Ezunial Burts, port executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Added James Preusch, chief financial officer: "It's clear that it will be 
slower. It is not clear if it will be lower." 
</P>
<P>
The latest report, for the fiscal year ending last June, shows that the port's 
operating revenues rose 2.7% to $153.6 million and net income increased 4.5% to 
$81.4 million. Cargo container traffic rose 2.4% to nearly 68 million tons.

RIO HONDO PRESIDENT GETS 2-YEAR CONTRACT EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rio Hondo Community College President Alex Sanchez has received a vote of 
confidence from the board of trustees who unanimously agreed to give him a 
two-year extension on his three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1989, trustees voted 3 to 2 to hire Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
Board members Bill Hernandez and Ralph Pacheco voted for another candidate. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hernandez and Pacheco said Sanchez has done a good job since replacing 
Herbert M. Sussman, who had been president since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"This represents a vote of confidence. This gives him an opportunity to 
implement his goals," Pacheco said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said also that Sanchez had done a good job in helping bring harmony 
to the board whose members who had often been at political odds with one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract does not call for any increase in pay for Sanchez, who was 
hired at $91,875 a year. However, he has received two cost-of-living increases, 
a 3.3% and a 5% hike. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez is the college's first Latino top administrator. More than half of the 
school's 12,600 students are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez was a vice president of the University of New Mexico before taking the 
Rio Hondo job.

NEIGHBORS EVACUATED WHILE POLICE DISPOSE OF DYNAMITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 800 residents were evacuated from their homes Tuesday while deputies 
from the sheriff's bomb squad safely destroyed 111 sticks of old dynamite found 
in a garage across the street from an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
South Gate police called sheriff's explosive experts to remove the dynamite 
that was found in the garage of a house at 8637 San Gabriel Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The dynamite was moved to the yard of San Gabriel Elementary School, where 
deputies disposed of it. The deputies neutralized the explosive sticks by 
soaking them in diesel fuel, then burning them. 
</P>
<P>
South Gate Police Lt. Mike Blaska said the dynamite apparently belonged to the 
deceased husband of the elderly woman who owns the house. The man, who died 
about three months ago, was believed to have been in the construction business, 
Blaska said. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not identify the woman or her husband. 
</P>
<P>
The explosives were discovered by a friend who was helping the woman prepare to 
move out of the house, police said. The explosives were discovered in a 
container dated 1942, but police said they were not sure how long the dynamite 
had been there. However, it had started to crystallize and was considered to be 
very dangerous and unstable. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made about 2:18 p.m. Residents were allowed to return around 
10 p.m.

EX-COUNCILMAN HARKEMA APPOINTED TO FILL VACANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Councilman Henry Harkema, who lost a reelection bid in April, was 
appointed Tuesday to fill the unexpired term of Vice Mayor Allen J. Parker, who 
died Dec. 7 of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Harkema was selected by the three Paramount City Council members who attended 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Esther Caldwell was absent. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Harkema finished fourth among seven candidates running for three 
seats. Harkema lost by 94 votes. Parker, who was serving his first term on the 
five-member council, received the largest number of votes, 1,103. His term runs 
through April, 1994. Parker, Mayor Manuel Guillen and Elvira Amaro won in the 
April election. 
</P>
<P>
Harkema, 79, a Paramount resident for 55 years, was on the council from 1986 to 
1989. The city rotates the mayoral position annually, and Harkema was mayor 
from 1988 to April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
He has been serving as chairman of the Planning Commission since his defeat. He 
resigned that position Tuesday to serve as a councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Guillen said that Harkema should be appointed to fill the vacancy because of 
the number of votes he received in the last election. The other council 
members, Amaro and Gerald Mulrooney, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
By state law the city had 30 days to appoint a replacement or call an election. 
City Manager William Holt told the council an election could not be held until 
June, 1991.

VALENZUELA, DODGERS STILL A TEAM; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: PITCHER AGREES TO ARBITRATION, BUT HIS STATUS ON THE CROWDED STAFF IS 
UP IN THE AIR. HATCHER ALSO ACCEPTS ARBITRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Dodger President Peter O'Malley intervening to help convince Fernando 
Valenzuela that the club sincerely wanted him back, the free-agent pitcher 
accepted an arbitration offer before the Wednesday night deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old left-hander, 13-13 with a 4.91 earned-run average in 1990, is 
returning, but as what? 
</P>
<P>
Starter, reliever or candidate to be cut or traded when the Dodgers sort out a 
congested pitching staff during spring training? 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a competitive situation, no getting around it," Executive Vice 
President Fred Claire said. "It's been a long time since we've had this kind of 
depth and experience." 
</P>
<P>
Even with Orel Hershiser's return still uncertain, a rotation of Tim Belcher, 
Ramon Martinez, Kevin Gross and Bob Ojeda has only one vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
And if Hershiser is not ready, the candidates for that one spot include Mike 
Morgan, Dennis Cook, Mike Hartley and Jim Neidlinger, in addition to 
Valenzuela, who completed only five of 33 starts as he continued his recovery 
from the shoulder problems of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed that management was divided on the wisdom of offering 
arbitration, giving Valenzuela a chance to return, though his acceptance 
sparked denial that there was ever dissent. 
</P>
<P>
The versatile Mickey Hatcher also accepted the Dodgers' arbitration offer, and 
both he and Valenzuela will have their 1991 contracts determined either through 
negotiation or arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
In arbitration (and negotiation as well, if the club insists on it), the 
contract is not fully guaranteed until opening day, leaving players at risk in 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
However, by accepting arbitration rather than remaining free agents, the 
players can become free agents again next winter. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Valenzuela, who made $2.2 million in salary and bonuses last 
season, is likely to receive a major raise through arbitration by favorably 
comparing his 13 victories to a number of less successful pitchers who have 
signed lucrative contracts this winter. 
</P>
<P>
"We think one year will be good for Fernando," agent Tony DeMarco said of the 
contract length. "We think we're in a very nice position." 
</P>
<P>
DeMarco insisted that Valenzuela had offers from clubs he refused to identify 
but decided to stay with the Dodgers because of his love for team, city and 
fans, and assurances by O'Malley in a meeting with Claire and DeMarco Tuesday 
that Valenzuela is appreciated as much as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the absence of a Dodger contract offer, Valenzuela might have 
harbored doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to comment on that, but you can draw your own conclusions," said 
DeMarco, who went on to imply that Valenzuela was appeased by O'Malley's role, 
not the first time "he's come through in the clutch. I mean, I've requested his 
help before, but this was spontaneous, which should not be taken as a criticism 
of Fred Claire. He's always been a gentleman, but the boss is the boss." 
</P>
<P>
Said O'Malley: "We talked as friends and I told Tony that everyone wanted 
Fernando back, that the offer wasn't a bluff, that it was made in good faith. 
We're happy he accepted, happy he'll be pitching for us again. He's a good man, 
an excellent member of the team." 
</P>
<P>
Added Claire: "We wouldn't have made the offer if we didn't feel Fernando could 
help the club and we wanted him back. We've made additions since then, but that 
thought still prevails. And even before we made the arbitration offer (Dec. 7), 
we invited Tony in to assure him it was sincere, but he didn't feel that was 
the right time for a meeting. We extended the invitation again this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The key part of all this is that Fernando has a long, historic and meaningful 
relationship with the Dodgers and that goes beyond a lot of other areas. He's 
almost one of a kind -- if not one of a kind." 
</P>
<P>
Though Claire went on to say that Valenzuela will still have to compete in 
spring training, the conclusion seems obvious: 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley, cognizant of Valenzuela's place in club lore, was unwilling to risk 
negative publicity without, at least, the offer of arbitration, and it was 
accepted by Valenzuela despite offers from other teams. 
</P>
<P>
Now? O'Malley said depth is essential, that the days "when a handful of guys 
can carry a team from start to finish" are gone. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate speculation is that a strong spring performance by Valenzuela 
might influence the Dodgers to make Ojeda the left-handed closer. 
</P>
<P>
Of the competition his client faces, DeMarco said: "I don't know what to say 
about that except that the team is very strong in that area. I don't know what 
to say except Fernando is not worried about that or anything else."

TWO-SPORT ALL-STAR: BO MAKES PRO BOWL; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: TOWNSEND, WISNIEWSKI AND MOSEBAR JOIN JACKSON ON AFC TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Jackson, the AFC's 13th-leading rusher and still the second-leading rusher 
on his own team behind Marcus Allen, was one of four Raiders named to the AFC 
Pro Bowl team Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson became the first athlete to be named to the All-Star team in baseball 
and the Pro Bowl in football. Jackson was named to the 1989 All-Star game as a 
member of the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
Other Raiders named were defensive end Greg Townsend, guard Steve Wisniewski 
and center Don Mosebar. It will be the second Pro Bowl trip for Mosebar, the 
first for Townsend, Wisniewski and Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Jackson's flair for the spectacular influenced his peers. In eight 
games this season, Jackson has recorded touchdown runs of 55 and 62 yards. He 
added an 88-yard run last Sunday that received some attention. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has gained 605 yards in 97 carries this season, an average of 6.2 yards 
per carry. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson initially refused comment on his Pro Bowl selection -- he speaks with 
the print media only after games -- but later relented. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't consider myself unique," Jackson said of his selection. "I'm just 
Bo. I've been competing in sports all my life. It's nothing new to me." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he is thrilled at his selection to the Pro Bowl because the voting 
is conducted by NFL players. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people that understand athletes are athletes," he said. "You guys 
(sportswriters) think you know us, but you don't. So I do take that as a 
compliment." 
</P>
<P>
Raider Coach Art Shell made the Pro Bowl announcements at Wednesday's morning 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"He called out Wiz's (Wisniewski's) name first," Jackson said. "We were 
cheering for him. And then he said my name, and it was like somebody slapped me 
in the face with a dumbbell. I didn't know what to think. I thought it was a 
joke. Fortunately, it was true." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Pro Bowl game, held Feb. 3 in Hawaii, might cut into his 
vacation time between football and the opening of baseball spring training in 
March, Jackson said: "I'm too young to think about resting. I'll think about 
that when I get your guys' ages." 
</P>
<P>
Shell said he thought Jackson was deserving of Pro Bowl consideration last 
season, when he gained 950 yards in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who shares the team's tailback position with Allen, is also believed 
to be the first non-starting player to make the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a backup in your mind, not mine," Shell responded. 
</P>
<P>
Some thought Townsend's selection was also long overdue, but this season his 
statistics were difficult to ignore. Townsend, completing his eighth season, is 
tied for third in the AFC in sacks with 12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been thinking about it all the time," Townsend said of the days leading 
up to his selection. "I really, really wanted it to happen this year." 
</P>
<P>
Wisniewski made his first Pro Bowl in his second season, a surprise in that the 
Raiders switched him from right guard to left this season to make room for Plan 
B acquisition Max Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
"To have it so soon in my career is a blessing," Wisniewski said. "I don't 
think I'm the best guard in the league right now, but I'm working at it. I 
still believe I'm more comfortable at right guard, but I guess the coaches knew 
what they were doing when they moved me to the left side." 
</P>
<P>
Mosebar, the team's center, also made the Pro Bowl after the 1986 season.

JIM MURRAY: LEADING MAN HAS BEEN CAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a reasonable enough question and commentary, and Brett Butler accepted 
it as such. "How," the reporter wanted to know, "do you get 90 walks a season? 
I mean, you're not Babe Ruth." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, when you ask a ballplayer a question such as that, you get a learned 
dissertation about waiting for your pitch, being patient, learning the strike 
zone. Ted Williams would give you a half hour. 
</P>
<P>
But, Brett Butler pondered the variables, then went right to the heart of the 
matter. "Well, you start with the umpires," he began. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute! The umpire!? 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them are consistent, but some are inconsistent in their strike zones. 
You have to know what they think is a strike, too. And how they call the game." 
</P>
<P>
He paused. "Then, you can't be too egotistical." 
</P>
<P>
Egotistical?! You have to be humble to be a selective hitter? 
</P>
<P>
"You have to know your limits. You have to know what you can't hit." 
</P>
<P>
What you can't hit usually is ball four. A lot of big league hitters never 
learn this. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see what made Brett Butler one of the game's premier leadoff 
hitters. In addition to studying the umpires, he also studied Rickey Henderson 
and Wade Boggs, two of the game's foremost practitioners of the art. He talked 
with both about the arts and mysteries of leading off. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Macy's and Gimbel's, baseball players eagerly share secrets -- even with 
the enemy. Pitchers tell pitchers what hitters don't like. Leadoff men, almost 
a vanishing breed in this era of the over-swinging, over-eager modern batsmen 
who will try to hit anything that doesn't hit them first, exchange tips 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
It's a leadoff batter's duty to make a pitcher work. Every at-bat should be a 
battle. His job is to start rallies, to get pitchers out of their rhythm, score 
runs one base at a time. 
</P>
<P>
A leadoff batter shouldn't be a hero. He should be a pest, a nuisance, almost 
an infection. Eddie Stanky used to starch the sleeves of his long johns so he 
could get hit by pitches (strikes, if possible) without leaving bruises. Luke 
Appling used to foul off pitches he didn't care for till the pitcher would need 
a straitjacket. 
</P>
<P>
The leadoff hitter has to have the soul of a pickpocket. His is a dirty-uniform 
position. He has to be a threat to bunt, a threat to steal. Brett Butler hit 
only three home runs last year. But he got on base more than 300 times. His 
on-base percentage, .397, was topped only by Barry Bonds and Jack Clark in the 
league. He got 192 hits. He scored 108 runs. He always scores 100 runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you set goals?" he is asked. "Two hundred hits? One hundred runs? A .300 
average?" 
</P>
<P>
"I set goals. I don't announce them. I announced them one year. Then, I went 
out and hit .217." 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't one of your goals?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Missed my goal by 83 points," Butler acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
If Butler answers a pressing need of the Dodgers for a leadoff man, he also 
goes a long way toward filling another gaping hole -- center field. It has been 
proved over and over that teams can win pennants with marginal third basemen, 
barely adequate left fielders, even, sometimes, clumsy first basemen. But a 
team can never win a pennant with a klutz in center field. Usually, a Willie 
Mays or a Joe DiMaggio is out there. The Dodgers had Duke Snider and Willie 
Davis aboard in center field in their salad days. 
</P>
<P>
Great center fielders play a shallow post and rely on speed and instinct to get 
them back for the long drives. But Candlestick Park, where Brett Butler 
patrolled, was not a hospitable environment for chance-taking. You played deep 
and prayed a lot in Candlestick. 
</P>
<P>
"Willie Mays gave me the best advice on how to play Candlestick," Butler 
recalls. "You waited on the fly balls. You counted '1000-and-one, 1000-and-2' 
and then you went into your jump. 
</P>
<P>
"Dodger Stadium should be a pleasant change," he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers hope so. The acquisition of Brett Butler allows the Dodgers to keep 
Kal Daniels' potent bat in the lineup. It also, however, keeps Kal Daniels' 
glove in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Butler is not worried. "At San Francisco, I had Kevin Mitchell on one 
side of me and Mike Kingery on the other. With Darryl Strawberry in the 
outfield, I don't feel I'll have to be making too many catches in right field." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers need to make up five games on Cincinnati. Any pitcher can tell you 
a skilled center fielder can be worth 5-10 games in a pennant drive. Any 
manager can tell you an active leadoff hitter can spark 5-10 games into the win 
column. If their new No. 22 can do both and the team wins the pennant, Dodger 
fans will be sure of one thing: The Butler did it.

The University of Florida has canceled games against Miami in 1992 and beyond, 
saying the decision was forced on them because of Southeastern Conference 
adopted an eight-game league schedule, beginning in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
This move limited Florida's flexibility in making a schedule. Florida will have 
to pay a $75,000 penalty for canceling game in 1992 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
Miami officials were miffed because, they said, they were never notified of 
Florida's decision. "I was shocked to learn through the newspaper about the 
Florida series," Athletic Director Sam Jankovich said.

ANGELS OFFER FREE AGENT GAETTI 4 YEARS AT ESTIMATED $10 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels, who said last week that they were interested in new-look free agent 
Gary Gaetti, took the next step Wednesday, making an initial contract proposal 
of four years at an estimated $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bronner, Gaetti's Chicago-based agent, said the offer showed serious intent 
and would lead to further conversation. 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota Twins' third baseman is one of 15 players who received free 
agency in the collusion settlement and has until Jan. 29 to sign with another 
team or return to the Twins with a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
Bronner said several clubs, including the Twins, are pursuing Gaetti but 
refused to speculate as to when he would make a decision. Angel General Manager 
Mike Port leaves today for a vacation in Hawaii. Senior assistant Dan O'Brien 
is also scheduled for time off over the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, free-agent infielder Donnie Hill, who had been offered arbitration 
by the Angels, reached agreement with the club on a 1991 contract calling for 
$500,000, plus incentives. The versatile Hill made $225,000 in salary and 
incentives last season while batting .264. ROSS NEWHAN

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: CSUN'S BOYKIN TAKES STEPS TO LET OFF STEAM AFTER WHISTLE 
BLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Northridge forward Shelton Boykin is a colorful personality who acts 
out the momentum swings of the game -- on and off the court. 
</P>
<P>
A steal by Northridge elicits a smile and a shake of the fist. A mistake by 
himself or a teammate and Boykin is crushed. 
</P>
<P>
But it is nothing compared to his response when an official's call goes against 
CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Boykin's temper has boiled over so many times that he has been forced to 
develop an unusual way of controlling his anger. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in an 88-73 loss to Cal State Long Beach, Boykin took a walk rather than 
let his temper get the best of him, as was the case in the Montana State game 
when he was whistled for two technical fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Boykin's strategy -- to get away from the officials -- goes back to his days at 
San Fernando High. Once during his senior year, Boykin was so upset about being 
assessed a foul that he walked out of the gym and into the foyer just as the 
player he fouled shot a free throw. 
</P>
<P>
When the opponent finished shooting his second free throw, Boykin came back 
through the opposite door and joined the game in progress. 
</P>
<P>
In Boykin's view it is CSUN against the world. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to fight eight people (the opposition and three officials), plus the 
ninth man, the crowd," he said after the Long Beach game. 
</P>
<P>
"It is real frustrating when we shoot one free throw and they shoot 16 in the 
first half. I had to leave the gym twice to calm down. It worked tonight and 
I'll stick with it until something drastic happens and I get beat up in the 
hallway." 
</P>
<P>
Unless he is outmanned, there is little danger of that happening: Boykin stands 
6-foot-5 and weighs 220 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Passed over: Rachel Wackerman put up eye-popping numbers for the Cal Lutheran 
women's soccer team this season, but when it came time for postseason honors 
she was virtually shut out. 
</P>
<P>
Wackerman, a freshman forward, led the National Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics with 30 goals, six more than the next highest total in the NAIA, and 
she had the second-highest total in the NAIA since 1980. She is tied for 11th 
on the all-time single-season list for all four-year collegiate-level women. 
</P>
<P>
However, Wackerman was not only omitted from the All-American team, she was 
left off the All-Area team, which includes Districts 3 and 5, in voting by 
coaches. "I don't think it was fair to Rachel," Cal Lutheran Coach George Kuntz 
said. "I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
Condor cool-down: Assistant John Price picked up a couple victories as the 
Oxnard men's basketball coach last weekend while Coach Remy McCarthy served a 
two-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
The Western State Conference suspended McCarthy for his abuse of officials in a 
Moorpark tournament game against Citrus. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy says he will not change his high-energy coaching style, "but I do plan 
on trying to channel that emotion toward getting guys to play hard and not 
disputing officials' calls." 
</P>
<P>
Gunner's intuition: Kyle Kerlegan sensed a win over San Diego five minutes into 
last Friday's basketball game at Matador Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the Toreros were preseason favorites to win the West Coast 
Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were at home and even though we weren't playing well, they weren't 
either," said Kerlegan, who led CSUN with 18 points. "We knew if we could get 
our act together, they weren't superhuman." 
</P>
<P>
The 83-73 win gives the Matadors momentum going into a Dec. 28 game at Idaho 
State and also helps make up for a winless trip to Montana and Montana State. 
</P>
<P>
Position switch: Chris Peery, who rushed for 3,928 yards and scored 60 
touchdowns for Canyon High from 1986-89, will play inside linebacker at Valley 
College next season, according to Monarch Coach Chuck Ferrero. 
</P>
<P>
A defensive lineman at Canyon as a freshman, Peery switched to running back in 
1987 and was named state sophomore player of the year by Cal-Hi Sports. He 
enrolled at Valley recently after withdrawing from Cal State Fullerton earlier 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him what side of the ball he wanted to play on and he said defense," 
Ferrero said of Peery, who was listed at 6-2, 214 as a Canyon senior. "He's got 
the size and speed to excel at (linebacker)." 
</P>
<P>
Youth movement: A precocious group of freshmen on the Valley women's basketball 
team have been forced to grow up quickly because of key injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (13-1) went to the Sequoias tournament without starting center Stacie 
Toon (out until early January because of a knee injury) and starting forward 
Ericka Miller (out until after Christmas because of an ankle injury). 
</P>
<P>
However, Valley triumphed over a strong tournament field at Visalia and heads 
into the Christmas break with an eight-game winning streak, in part because of 
freshmen Falicia Stanley, Katina Mines, Anna Giles and Wendy Bruse. 
</P>
<P>
"The freshmen are really picking up the slack," Coach Doug Michelson said. 
"That's what's doing it for us; the freshmen are starting to play like 
sophomores." 
</P>
<P>
Injury update: With two weeks to rehabilitate his sprained ankle, David Keeter 
is expected to be able to return to the CSUN basketball lineup in time for the 
Matadors' next game at Idaho State, Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Statwatch: Through its first five games, Northridge attempted an average of 
29.2 three-point baskets a game. In its past three games, CSUN has attempted an 
average of only 15.6. 
</P>
<P>
Center Todd Bowser, a senior, is 85 points short of 10th place on CSUN's 
all-time scoring list. Lorren Bracci (1967-69) is currently 10th with 979. 
Bowser's 508 career rebounds put him seventh on CSUN's all-time list. He needs 
three to surpass No. 6 Jack Dyck, who had 510 rebounds from 1972-75. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran's Jeff deLaveaga is ranked seventh nationally among NAIA scoring 
leaders with a 29.0 average. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The 139 points Antelope Valley scored against Rio Hondo was the school's 
highest total under second-year coach Newton Chelette and the second-highest in 
school history. Antelope Valley tied a school record for points in a half with 
78 in the first half. . . . 
</P>
<P>
After six games, Antelope Valley's J.R. Rider has scored 30 or more points four 
times, leaving him two short of the school season record and three short of the 
career record for 30-or-more-point games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers Theresa Munoz, Brendan Healey and John Ortega contributed to this 
notebook. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
<P>
After missing a slew of shots in an early-season loss to Orange Coast College, 
Little turned to Coach Rob DiMuro and said, "That will never happen again. I 
will never miss easy shots like that again." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to predictions, she is no Chicken Little. Since then, her shots 
have been falling -- as have Pierce's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a player who can do that," DiMuro said. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce has won 10 of 11 games since the loss to Orange Coast and wrapped up the 
Canyons tournament championship last weekend. Little, who is averaging 21.4 
points and 8.1 rebounds a game, scored 77 points, grabbed 23 rebounds and 
blocked nine shots in three tournament games and was named most valuable 
player. 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura High product already has signed a letter of intent to play for San 
Jose State. She did not play last season for Pierce because she transferred at 
the semester break from Valley.

MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH . . .

<P>
Amid the bulldozed hills and subdivisions-in-progress, a horse ranch has arisen 
in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho del Puma, a 100-acre complex in the Santa Monica Mountains, is the 
creation of developer Larry Dinovitz, who put his cousin, 20-year-old 
show-jumper Candice Schlom, in charge of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
The private facility, which opened a year ago, has a knotty-pine stable with 16 
horses, a 250-by-300-foot sand ring, a terraced grand-prix derby field and a 
partially covered patio for spectators. At least two show-jumping competitions 
a year will be held at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a duplication of other facilities in other countries where our horses 
will be competing in international competitions," Dinovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Dinovitz has been involved with horses most of his life. In the 1960s, he and 
his wife owned and operated the Rocking K, a dude ranch in Bishop, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The surrounding mountains provide privacy but also have another benefit. "We do 
a lot of riding in the mountains for the horses' muscles," Schlom said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the name of the ranch . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There's a puma in these mountains," Schlom said. "We've seen it once." JEFF

PARENTS TURN PAIN OF LOSS INTO LIVING LEGACIES; 
</P>
<P>
CHARITY: THE DEATH OF A CHILD HAS PROMPTED SOME MOTHERS AND FATHERS TO 
ESTABLISH FUND-RAISERS AND FOUNDATIONS IN MEMORY OF YOUNGSTERS.

<P>
Alisa Ann Ruch never got a chance to make a difference in this world. The 
8-year-old Van Nuys girl died June 28, 1970, from burns she received in a 
back-yard barbecue accident. 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to her mother, Diane Host, Alisa Ann's memory has made a difference 
to children throughout the state. A year after the child's death, Host started 
the Alisa Ann Ruch Burn Foundation to educate children about fire safety and 
first-aid procedures and to provide financial assistance to families of burn 
victims. Today, the foundation is the largest of its kind and is credited with 
teaching children to stop, drop and roll if their clothing catches fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It was devastating losing Alisa Ann," Host said recently. "After she was gone, 
something pushed me to do this, to make this foundation a reality. It was like 
somewhere, somehow Alisa Ann was pushing me on." 
</P>
<P>
Host is one of a few San Fernando Valley parents who have experienced a child's 
death and gone on to help others in their child's memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the paralyzing effects of grief, it is not common for grieving 
parents to create a living memorial for children who have died," said Maria 
Iacobo, a public information officer for Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles. 
"Those who do have managed to use the child's memory as a driving force." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Carrier of Sun Valley and Warren and Mary Campbell of Northridge say 
they, too, were spurred on to create memorials in memory of children they loved 
and watched die. Carrier is the driving force behind the Alexis Macfarlane 
Memorial Tennis Tournament, which raises money to find a cure for leukemia, and 
the Campbells hold annual fund-raisers that benefit various charities. 
</P>
<P>
Host never thought about burn treatment or education before Alisa Ann's 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I don't want her to have died for nothing," said Host, who is no longer 
married to Alisa Ann's father. "I want every child and adult to know what to do 
if they are involved in a burn accident." 
</P>
<P>
In late May, 1970, the Ruch family got together for a barbecue at their Van 
Nuys home to welcome the summer. Sometime after noon, Alisa Ann's father doused 
the charcoal with lighter fluid and put the can several feet away on the 
family's picnic table. 
</P>
<P>
The children -- Ethan, 10; Alisa Ann, 8, and David, 5 -- gathered near the 
table, eager for the barbecuing to begin. Their father lit the coals -- and in 
an instant, the flame puffed out toward the lighter fluid can, causing it to 
explode and spew flaming liquid at the children and their father. 
</P>
<P>
David's clothes caught fire and Ethan, who had miraculously been untouched by 
the explosion, immediately turned to his brother and put out the flames -- 
probably saving his life, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
But Alisa Ann, who had been closest to the can before it exploded, was covered 
in flames. In that moment of panic, rather than run to her father -- whose 
hands and arms had been burned but who was only a few feet away -- Alisa Ann 
turned and ran 20 yards toward the house where her mother had been preparing 
the food. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked out and saw her running toward me all aflame," said Host, who was 
four months pregnant. "I grabbed a tablecloth and rolled her in it." 
</P>
<P>
Host immediately drove her family to a hospital and from there David and Alisa 
Ann were transferred to the Sherman Oaks Burn Center. Despite David's severe 
burns, which covered 23% of his body, he was judged to have a good chance of 
recovering. 
</P>
<P>
But Alisa Ann, the blond girl with big blue eyes and rosy cheeks, was seriously 
burned over her entire body and doctors said she had only a 1% chance of 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
For the next four weeks, Alisa Ann was conscious and alert as a team of 
specialists led by Dr. A. Richard Grossman worked to save her life. 
</P>
<P>
"We had parties and lesson time and lots of socializing in Alisa Ann's room 
during that time," Host said. "Through it all, she had such an incredible 
spirit, such a positive outlook about the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
But in the end there was nothing anyone could do. Alisa Ann died at the Sherman 
Oaks Burn Center. Four months later, on Nov. 28, 1970, Host gave birth to a 
girl and named her Frani Alisa Ruch. 
</P>
<P>
"I was determined, despite her name, that I wouldn't force this little girl to 
take Alisa Ann's place," Host said. "And so I began dreaming about creating a 
foundation to keep her memory alive." 
</P>
<P>
Host's dream became a reality in 1971 when her uncle, attorney Zola Siegal, and 
his wife, Muriel, offered to take care of the paperwork that would get the 
foundation started. Money to begin the foundation arrived in letters and cards 
sent to the family, and annual fund raising keeps it going. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the foundation raises several hundred thousand dollars and gives 
financial assistance each year to more than 300 families of burn victims. It 
has also provided classroom curricula regarding burn prevention and treatment 
to schools throughout the state. The foundation offers a free summer camp for 
young burn victims, support groups, a back-to-school program and a back-to-work 
program to help integrate burn victims back into society. There are six 
chapters throughout the state staffed by dozens of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Carrier, 31, hopes that someday the Alexis Macfarlane Memorial Tennis 
Tournament will be equally successful in raising money to help children. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, when his daughter, Jessica, was 3, she couldn't seem to shake 
a bad cold. About the same time, he noticed that she was bruising more easily 
than usual. Blood tests showed that Jessica had leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, doctors began chemotherapy and Jessica was admitted to Childrens 
Hospital, where she shared a room with 11-year-old Alexis Macfarlane, also 
suffering from leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Alexis formed a bond with Jessica that hospital attendants said is unusual 
among young cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Childhood cancer is very, very painful, and most of the time the kids are in 
too much pain to walk down to the playroom or even sit up in bed," Carrier 
said. "But Alexis had a way of forgetting her own pain and comforting Jessica 
instead." 
</P>
<P>
If Jessica was going in for a special chemotherapy treatment, Alexis would tell 
Carrier what Jessica could expect. And when Jessica would come out of 
treatment, Alexis would tell her that everything was going to be OK, that the 
pain would go away soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Alexis did so much for all of us that she became like my own daughter," said 
Carrier, who is divorced from Jessica's mother, Paulette Elkins. "It was a very 
frightening, lonely time in my life as I watched my little girl suffer and 
Alexis was a single ray of light. She helped all of us to go on." 
</P>
<P>
But in October, 1987, it became evident that Alexis was not going to survive. 
Her final request was a trip to Hawaii with her parents and it was there, later 
that month, that Alexis died. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if Jessica understood that Alexis wasn't ever going to come 
back," Carrier said. "Lots of her friends at the hospital had died, but with 
Alexis, I think somehow Jessica wanted to believe she was still alive, still 
making someone smile." 
</P>
<P>
And so, to keep Alexis' memory alive, Carrier began the memorial tennis 
tournament that in September, in its second year, raised more than $13,000 for 
the Hematology-Oncology Department at Childrens Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Alexis loved to play tennis and had dreamed of living long enough to play on a 
tennis team; Michael Carrier owns a tennis shop in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"A tennis tournament seemed like an obvious way to help other children who have 
cancer, children like my daughter," Carrier said. 'And at the same time, it 
seemed like the perfect way to keep Alexis' memory alive." 
</P>
<P>
Alexis' parents live out of state but support Carrier's efforts, he said. 
Although they plan to attend the tournament eventually, neither parent has 
participated in the first two because they are still dealing with their 
daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
In the recent tournament, Carrier attracted enough locally prominent tennis 
players that Century Cable televised several matches. L'Ermitage Foundation and 
the city of West Hollywood sponsored the tournament, which was held at Plummer 
Park in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking to make this even bigger next year," Carrier said. "She was such a 
special little girl that I want this tournament to really make a difference in 
her memory." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jessica has been in remission for several months, but doctors say 
she must go as long as eight years before she can be considered free of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, Alexis is still helping Jessica even now, just like she did when 
she was here with us," Carrier said. "It takes money to research a cure for 
leukemia and each year as the tennis tournament grows, so will the funds that 
someday will find that cure. Knowing that makes it easy to keep this up." 
</P>
<P>
Mary and Warren Campbell agree that the tedious and sometimes frustrating 
aspects of fund raising pale when they think of the people they are helping in 
their daughter's memory. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Campbell was 23 when she had a dermatologist check out an irregular mole 
on her back. It was diagnosed as melanoma, a form of skin cancer. Doctors 
removed a large area surrounding the mole, including lymph nodes near the 
incision, and a biopsy showed that all the cancer had been removed. 
</P>
<P>
For the next several years, Lynn continued full time the activities she had 
been involved with most of her adult life -- fund raising. She volunteered to 
raise money for the United Farm Workers and then for several women's groups. 
</P>
<P>
But four years later, in 1983, Lynn noticed a lump under her skin, and doctors 
found that the cancer had spread throughout her body. On April 21, 1984, five 
years to the day after receiving the initial diagnosis of melanoma, Lynn died 
of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Campbell remembers spending long hours with the youngest of her three 
daughters before she died. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked her what I could do to carry on the work she'd been doing," Campbell 
said. "She couldn't answer me because she was too sick. But I knew before she 
died that I had to continue her fund raising." 
</P>
<P>
And so the Campbells created the Lynn Campbell Memorial Fund and set about 
thinking up ways to raise money for the kinds of charitable organizations that 
Lynn might have wanted to help if she were alive. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell has owned Magic Years Nursery School in Reseda for 26 years and 
decided to involve her students' parents in a fund-raising dinner that would 
commemorate the one-year anniversary of Lynn's death. Her husband, Warren, a 
political science professor at Cal State Northridge, helped pull it off and the 
dinner, prepared by the parents and hosted free of charge at Temple Judea in 
Tarzana, took place just as Mary Campbell had planned. 
</P>
<P>
Because there was no overhead, all $14,000 raised that evening went to the 
Valley Shelter for the Homeless in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Campbells have held several smaller fund-raisers in their 
daughter's memory. They also make jam and jelly, which they sell to parents of 
the preschool children, and encourage the parents to bring their recyclable 
items to the school, where the Campbells keep a trailer to collect the items. 
Once a week, Warren Campbell takes a trailer carrying newspaper, glass and 
aluminum to be recycled and turns the funds over to the Lynn Campbell Memorial 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't be Lynn or do just what she would have done," Mary Campbell said. "But 
I wanted to carry on her memory in some way." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, Carrier and Host say that in many ways, their fund-raising and 
memorial efforts have helped them deal with the grief involved in losing a 
child of their own or one close to them. 
</P>
<P>
"But not everyone would choose to deal with their loss this way," Campbell 
said. "It's hard work, and it's very emotional. I still can't look at some of 
the pictures of Lynn as a little girl that we show people who help us with the 
fund raising. But each time I do something in her memory, I deal with another 
piece of the grief." 
</P>
<P>
Childrens Hospital spokeswoman Iacobo said that the hospital is used to dealing 
with parents who have suffered through the death of a child and that they often 
want to turn their grief into something positive to help someone else. 
</P>
<P>
"But typically they are so exhausted, emotionally and physically, because of 
their loss that they are unable to launch a living memorial," she said. "It is 
remarkable how any of these parents do this at all."

Come Back, Mary 
</P>
<P>
Every holiday season for the past six years, Sheryl Mertes, a secretary at 
Rocketdyne, has turned into a director-producer. 
</P>
<P>
This year is no different. 
</P>
<P>
The annual children's Christmas program is one of her chores as director of the 
Sunday school at Our Savior's First Lutheran Church in Granada Hills. She finds 
the material, enlists a musical director, gets the costumes together, casts the 
40 or so parts, then turns into a nervous wreck. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, she said, there is at least one day when she asks herself how she 
could have gotten into this. That time is the Saturday before the Sunday 
performance when the sanctuary, where the youngsters will perform, is the scene 
of some confusion as the four-hour dress rehearsal proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph is complaining that Mary is always walking away from the altar and 
leaving him up there by himself. One of the narrators beheads some of the 
poinsettias in an attempt to get the microphone cord to follow her down the 
altar steps. Someone's little brother falls down and bashes his head. Several 
angels have taken off their halos and are chewing on them. And there is a 
rising sound of unrest from the wise men, shepherds, singers, narrators and 
others in the cast of "The Story of Giving" that is not unlike the sound of 
feeding time in the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Mertes decides that this is a good time to take the youngsters to the 
recreation hall for some popcorn and punch. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of assorted Sunday school-teaching parents, she has the cast 
march single file to get their goodies. It is a wondrous sight as the 40 
youngsters, ages 3 to 13, politely and quietly head on out in their First 
Christmas finery. 
</P>
<P>
Once the goodies are given out, Mertes has a moment to catch her breath. 
</P>
<P>
She has been a member of the church for 35 years, since her parents brought her 
to the San Fernando Valley from Wisconsin as a little girl. Back then, she 
said, the church was just a small wooden building and there were only about 30 
members. Now the church is a series of impressive buildings, including a 
weekday school, and has a membership of 600, including her husband, John, a 
Catholic convert, who is going to play the Voice of God in the children's 
program, and her son, John Sturgis, 17, whom she has enlisted as an all-round 
trouble-shooter. 
</P>
<P>
Mertes was confirmed at this church, and her son was baptized and confirmed 
there. He also did time, he said later, as a shepherd for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Son John said he doesn't mind the Christmas program craziness at his home but 
that his mother gets a bit stressed. "She gets tense, real preoccupied," he 
said, "because the program is a big responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
"I start every year in the spring getting the material and costumes so that by 
the fall, we are ready to go into rehearsals," Mertes said. 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't discuss the problems of casting the program every year, but trying 
to match the expectations of the 80 or so parents and the performance abilities 
of the 40 or 45 children is probably a delicate exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Erin Carey, 6, does not have a speaking part, but she is the Virgin Mary. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if she auditioned for the role, she looked at her inquirer and said 
pertly: "No, I did not." 
</P>
<P>
When asked why she is always walking off and leaving Joseph on the stage by 
himself, she said: "I do not." 
</P>
<P>
When asked where she goes to school, she said, "I do not remember right now," 
in a tone that clearly indicates that she wishes to be through with this 
tedious star interrogation so she can get to her popcorn and punch. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Brown, 8, one of the narrators of the Christmas program, is more willing 
to accommodate an interview request. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly handsome in a dark suit and tie, he said that he attends Our 
Savior's school during the week and that he would like to be an elevator 
repairman, like his dad. 
</P>
<P>
He has a lot of lines in the performance because, he says, he is the one who 
tells the story as the performance goes along. "Last year, I got to be a 
shepherd and said something with the rest of the shepherds, but this is the 
first time I get to talk alone." 
</P>
<P>
Will he be nervous, standing at the pulpit in front of the whole congregation, 
having all those words to say? 
</P>
<P>
Lance considered the question for a moment and then said, "I don't think I 
will. I get to tell people that God is good and that His gift of love is the 
most important one. Besides, I can read it. I can have the words in front of me 
so I won't make a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Mistakes, however, will be made, according to Mertes. Youngsters won't show up 
because they are sick or whatever. Some will trip over their lines or their 
feet. But in the end, said Mertes, it will be OK. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't really matter what the kids do," she said. "The parents will love 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buying Green 
</P>
<P>
There's a shop in Valley malls where you can buy gifts and save the planet at 
the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Natural Wonders -- with stores in Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, Topanga Plaza in 
Canoga Park, Glendale Galleria and Northridge Fashion Center -- is full of 
books, toys, mobiles, puzzles, tapes and equipment such as binoculars and 
telescopes that allow you to explore the universe. And some of the items -- 
like the Greenpeace calendar with a winsome otter on the cover that sells for 
$8.95 -- benefit their producers, who are dedicated to protecting and 
preserving the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
"People seem really glad to find a place where they can buy enjoyable gifts in 
a wide price range that monetarily contribute to organizations they support," 
Sherman Oaks store manager Pat Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Santa Myth 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone loves Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Many of us, says Dr. Michael Gross, medical director of Pine Grove Hospital in 
Canoga Park, still carry an unconscious fantasy known as the Santa Myth that 
makes us expect that Christmas will be perfect for us. 
</P>
<P>
It almost never is, he said, and some of us really get down about it. 
</P>
<P>
Gross said there are a number of things people can do to take the pressure off. 
</P>
<P>
* If you are lonely, sad and depressed, acknowledge it to yourself. Don't 
smother the pain with alcohol, pills or pretense. 
</P>
<P>
* If you are dreading the loneliness of being away from family and friends, 
don't be alone. Invite someone else to join you, as you might wish someone to 
do for you. 
</P>
<P>
* If you are on a tight budget, be honest with yourself and loved ones. There 
is no shame in doing only what you can afford. 
</P>
<P>
* If you feel tense whenever you think of everything you have to do, sit down 
and think through your priorities. Organize, plan ahead and do only what you 
can. 
</P>
<P>
Gross said we would all be better off if we took better care of ourselves. He 
suggested that during the holidays it is important to get enough sleep, eat 
well and slowly, exercise, take vitamins, avoid excessive amounts of coffee and 
tea, and remember that cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs actually increase 
stress. 
</P>

During the holidays, the perfume counters at major department stores offer a 
plethora of gifts with purchases. This year, the pickings are a touch slim, but 
there are a few good deals. 
</P>
<P>
Germaine Monteil has a gift package of four large-size skin-care products as a 
gift with any Germaine Monteil purchase. Spend $45 at the Fred Hayman counter 
and walk away with a lovely tote bag -- a $25 value. For the men, Boss Sport 
fragrance will present you with a racy metal toy car with any purchase, and 
Paul Sebastian is offering four nice 24% lead crystal mugs with a $24 purchase. 
</P>
<P>
For discounted fragrances, however, move on. In Tarzana, Lora has a good 
selection of popular scents priced 10% to 50% less than retail. Chanel comes in 
at the 10% figure. Van Cleef &amp; Arpel's First, in a two-ounce spray, offers 
a healthy savings, from $38 down to $29.95. Giorgio's usual $47.50 cologne is 
$39.95. There's a good selection of the popular miniatures, and a gift box of 
seven miniature perfumes with Ysatis, Ann Klein, Jean Patou, Ombre Rose, Diva, 
Krizia and Capucci is a nice $21.

<P>
A stop at Parfumerie Parisienne, tucked away in Canoga Park, can save on 
fragrances. The old standard Joy, a one-ounce eau de toilette splash, retails 
for $44; the price here is $34. Oscar de la Renta's popular scent in the 
three-ounce spray cologne is $36 instead of $45. A good discount on Cartier:

Another good source for perfumes at a discount is Mayumi, long a popular stop 
for the Westside crowd looking for deals on their favorite fragrances. Most of 
the big names are on the shelves at discounts that run from OK to terrific. 
Gucci's eau de parfum two-ounce spray is $15 (retail $30). Pison's 1.7-ounce 
cologne spray that retails for $30 is $22 here. Onbre Rose in the three-ounce

For the last-minute Louies of either sex, the Robe Factory has some of the best

the factory for a well-known and very high-end label that you see in pricey 
boutiques.

<P>
Full-length men's hooded robes in a 12-ounce terry-velour (the very best 
quality) retail for $195, but can be purchased at the factory for $80. Ladies' 
floor-length shawl robes with piping are $75 to $85 instead of $185 retail. A 
lighter-weight warp-knit terry velour, also floor-length, sells in the stores

jackets with hoods are $25. Pure cotton print robes, terry-lined, usually sell 
for $85 to $95; the Robe Factory's price is $25 to $35.

Throughout the San Fernando Valley, there are small landscaped parks that offer 
quiet, scenic places to enjoy an afternoon or a variety of play equipment to 
entertain children. Typically, these parks are tucked into neighborhoods in 
such a way that only people who live nearby visit them. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ridge Park is an exception. Situated at the foot of the Santa Susana 
Mountains on the north side of the Valley, this park is so beautiful that 
people from miles away to visit.

<P>
Maintenance workers at the park say there is always a gentle breeze that blows 
across the park and from nearly any spot on the 10-acre site, people can see 
across the Valley. KAREN KINGSBURY

The 21st game of the world chess championship between reigning champion Gary 
Kasparov and challenger Anatoly Karpov adjourned Wednesday night after 40 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
Play is to resume this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov, world champion since 1985, leads Karpov by 11 points to 9. He needs 
one more victory or two draws for a 12-12 tie, in which case he would retain 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
Karpov, the world champion before Kasparov, must win three of the last four 
games and draw the other to gain the 12 1/2 points he needs to win back the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Karpov, playing white, had a pawn advantage when the adjournment was declared 
after five hours of play, and he sealed his 41st move in an envelope. Analysts 
said the outcome of the game remains in doubt, since Karpov's king appeared to 
be more exposed to attack than Kasparov's. 
</P>

Here are the moves:

CZECHS EVICT CUBANS FROM EMBASSY IN U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: IT'S GETTING HARDER FOR A COMMUNIST COUNTRY TO FIND A SPONSOR IN 
WASHINGTON. 
</P>

<P>
Cuba's low-level diplomatic mission to Washington, technically a tenant of the 
Czechoslovak Embassy since 1977, received an eviction notice Wednesday. The 
move could force Cuba to find another sponsor or lose its only official contact 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But, in yet another sign of how much the world has changed in the last year, 
the hard-line Communist nation may find that it has few allies willing to 
sponsor its interests section. Such sections are established by governments 
that do not have full diplomatic relations with a given country and operate 
under the sponsorship of nations that do. 
</P>
<P>
Few old-style Communist governments are still represented in Washington for 
Cuba to approach. There has been speculation that Iraq might extend a welcome 
because the Cuban delegate to the Security Council defended Iraq in the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential sponsor would be Yemen, whose U.N. envoy joined Cuba to cast 
the only votes against a dozen U.N. resolutions involving Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel came under pressure from U.S. congressional 
and human rights groups to drop the Cubans last December after he took office 
as leader of his country's first non-Communist government in more than 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
During a visit here earlier this year, Havel was asked about the Cuban 
sponsorship by Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and other legislators. Havel responded 
that his new government had higher priority problems. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Daniel Vesely of the Czech Embassy confirmed Wednesday, "The Foreign 
Ministry today delivered notes to the U.S. and Cuban embassies in Prague, 
saying that the government of the Czech and Slovak Republic will no longer be 
responsible for the Cuban interests section in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
A State Department source said the United States finds the section "useful" in 
facilitating communications in the absence of normal diplomatic relations. He 
added, "It will be up to the government of Cuba to find an alternative host 
embassy." 
</P>
<P>
In Havana, a Foreign Ministry statement announced the change and said that 
another country will be sought to represent Cuba's interests in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom House, a human rights advocacy group headquartered in New York, led the 
drive to persuade the new Czech government to stop sponsoring the Cubans here. 
R. Bruce Malcolm, executive director of Freedom House, wrote to Havel last 
January protesting that Czechoslovakia continued to "represent in the United 
States a government which denies its citizens even the most fundamental human 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm reminded Havel that Fidel Castro endorsed the Soviet invasion of 
Czechoslovakia in 1968 and "even today condemns the movement toward democracy 
throughout the world." 
</P>
<P>
Of Human Rights, a Washington-based group dedicated to attaining freedom for 
Cuban political prisoners, also asked Czechoslovakia to end its relationship 
with Castro. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuban interests section -- two dozen diplomats and their families -- is 
housed in the old, pre-Castro embassy in a diplomatic enclave in Washington. A 
brass plaque on the iron fence surrounding the building still reads "Embassy of 
the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic," although the nation dropped the Socialist 
appellation after electing a non-Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba broke relations with the United States in 1961 and had no links until it 
established its interests section under Czechoslovak sponsorship in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Like their American counterparts in Havana, the Cuban diplomats perform many of 
the functions of an embassy. The U.S. interests section in Cuba operates under 
the protection of the embassy of neutral Switzerland. No change is expected in 
its status. 
</P>
<P>
The only other interests section now in Washington is Iran's, which operates 
under the aegis of the Algerian Embassy.

You can offer Sandy your congratulations. He battled the federal government and 
the state of Washington -- Sandy absorbed everything officialdom could throw at 
him, including the long-distance heave-ho, rubber arrows and M-80 firecrackers. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of that, Sandy had lunch and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
And it appears he has won. This winter, the government said uncle. 
</P>
<P>
Move over, you 500-pound gorilla, and meet Sandy, the 900-pound sea lion, who 
knows how to get his way. And, while you're at it, might at well meet Sandy's 
friends, too, dozens of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Guess who's back from California?" said a recent Seattle Times headline. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy, known by his radio collar as No. 42, is among a marauding band of young 
male California sea lions that you may have heard about in recent years. Each 
winter since the mid-1980s, an ever-growing band of sea lions has been drawn 
here north of its traditional territory. Here, within sight of downtown Seattle 
high rises, the sea lions have discovered a delicious and very weak link in the 
food chain. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ballard Ship Locks, which connect saltwater Puget Sound on the west of 
Seattle with freshwater Lake Washington on the east, the California sea lions 
have found a winter feast of steelhead, a prized ocean-going trout. The fish 
gather en masse at the dam at the foot of the locks as they head for their 
spawning grounds in the lake, and a sea lion barely has to do more than open 
its mouth and inhale. 
</P>
<P>
Which could be a mere urban wildlife novelty if it wasn't for greed. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy can eat 60 to 75 pounds of steelhead a day. Federal officials estimate 
that there are up to 40 sea lions visiting Puget Sound for the winter, with 
three to five of them swimming lazily in front of the locks on any given day, 
mouths agape. 
</P>
<P>
From 60% to 70% of the winter steelhead heading into Lake Washington end up 
fattening the sea lions, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
Last year, only half of the minimum number of fish needed to sustain a healthy 
population of Lake Washington steelhead made it past Sandy and the gang. 
</P>
<P>
Fishery biologists and Indian tribes that have fishing rights to the steelhead 
now fear for the very survival of the fish. 
</P>
<P>
The perplexing part is that both the sea lions and the steelhead are protected 
under laws that are now in conflict. Different government agencies with 
differing mandates this month conceded failure in costly -- and sometimes 
hugely entertaining -- efforts to rid the area of sea lions. 
</P>
<P>
The hope for saving the winter steelhead of Lake Washington now rests with 
scientists who are looking at the fish themselves. Can a way be devised to 
hurry the steelhead up the existing fish ladder at the locks? Salmon don't 
dally on their way up and are not so endangered by the sea lions. Otherwise, 
biologists are pondering whether they can fashion protective barriers to keep 
the steelhead separated or hidden from the sea lions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get funding, but we haven't had much success," said Eric 
Knudsen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
One idea is to put lights on the fish ladder in the hope that the steelhead 
will be attracted to climb up the ascending pools of water faster. Another 
suggestion is to flush freshwater down the fish ladder instead of saltwater. 
Maybe the steelhead will like that better. 
</P>
<P>
And biologists say they need to begin tagging the steelhead with tiny 
transmitters to learn their basic migration patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sandy and the other blubber boys have learned all they need to know: 
If you persevere, if you have an endearing face and if you weigh nearly half a 
ton, even the government cannot stand in your way forever. 
</P>
<P>
Two winters ago, batches of the sea lions were caught and trucked to the coast 
of southern Washington. They returned almost as fast as the trucks. Last 
winter, at a cost of about $15,000, six of the creatures were crated up and 
shipped back to their breeding grounds at California's Channel Islands as a 
test. Four returned, including one who made the 1,300-mile trip in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
In between, they were forced to listen to loud music and the recorded sounds of 
predatory killer whales. They were bombarded with firecrackers and rubber 
arrows. They were fed fish laced with chemicals that induced vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
To that, Sandy and the bunch seemed to have only one question: OK, when's 
dinner?

TAKING PAIN OUT OF READING MEDICARE MORTALITY REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hospital officials have criticized the federal government's annual reports on 
Medicare mortality at the nation's hospitals as misleading. Many consumers who 
turn to the reports for guidance on where to seek medical care have found them 
inscrutable. 
</P>
<P>
But next year, the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) plans 
significant improvements in the reports that should make them more useful and 
understandable to hospitals, physicians and consumers alike. 
</P>
<P>
A key improvement is the decision to publish death rates for eight medical 
conditions and nine procedures that are common in the elderly. These include 
heart-bypass surgery, angioplasty, prostate surgery, gallbladder removal, 
hysterectomies, heart attacks and hip fractures. 
</P>
<P>
The report will be "a much better publication for everybody," said John 
Spiegel, deputy director of the HCFA's Health Standards and Quality Bureau in 
Baltimore, which is responsible for the reports. It will be "more precise and 
easier to understand." 
</P>
<P>
The more specific statistics, while not a direct measure of the quality of 
care, should help patients discuss with physicians which hospital is best for 
common surgeries, and where to seek medical care for common problems. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the HCFA has lumped both illnesses and surgeries into broad 
"diagnostic categories" that meant little to consumers. The hospital's overall 
mortality rate also was listed, and it will continue to be published. But 
overall mortality rates are difficult to interpret because the statistic 
includes patients with varying risks of dying. 
</P>
<P>
The HCFA also will include information on mortality rates for three time 
periods after hospital admission -- 30, 90 and 180 days, as opposed to the 
single point of 30 days post admission used in previous years. According to the 
HCFA's Spiegel, this change was made because different time periods are needed 
to evaluate the effectiveness of medical care for different conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The improvements were announced earlier this month in a letter that Gail R. 
Wilensky, the administrator of the HCFA, sent to hospital administrators across 
the country. The hospitals were sent a copy of their own statistics. They have 
until Jan. 15 to review the statistics and submit explanations to the HCFA. 
These explanations will be published as part of the report. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the United Network for Organ Sharing, the 
Richmond-based organization that keeps organ transplant statistics, is soon 
expected to release for the first time survival data for the nation's 
transplant centers. 
</P>
<P>
Mortality rates are only one of many measures of hospital performance. But the 
review of deaths to determine which ones might have been preventable can often 
lead to improvements in the quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
The HCFA runs Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly 
and disabled. Its annual Medicare mortality reports, which have been published 
since 1987, have received considerable public attention. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent report, released last December, was based on a computerized 
analysis of about 10.5-million Medicare admissions at nearly 6,000 acute-care 
hospitals during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate statistics reflect the percentage of a hospital's Medicare 
patients who die within a certain number of days of being admitted, whether as 
patients or after discharge. This actual mortality rate is compared to a 
hospital's predicted mortality rate, which will be published. The predicted 
mortality rate estimates the relative risk of dying for patients based on such 
characteristics as age, sex, other diseases and previous hospitalizations. 
</P>
<P>
The next report, expected to be published early next year, will cover Medicare 
patients discharged from the nation's acute care hospitals in the fiscal year 
between October, 1988, and September, 1989. For comparison, statistics will be 
included for patients discharged from the same hospitals in the fiscal years 
1987 and 1988.

The Turkish government has asked its NATO allies to send air units to bases 
near the Turkish border with Iraq, opening the way for a foreign military 
buildup on a potential second front against Baghdad if the Persian Gulf crisis 
turns to war. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some communication between the Turkish military and NATO military on 
this subject, and these contacts continue," said Turkish Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Murat Sungar. "There has been no decision by NATO yet." 
</P>
<P>
The Turkish request involves air units from the United States, Belgium, Italy 
and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization members. If the units are put in 
place, Iraq would perceive that any attack on Turkey would be an attack on 
NATO, a Turkish official said. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept is not the force in itself," a senior Turkish official said. "It 
is not offensive. It shows NATO solidarity. The main idea is to deter potential 
aggression." 
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Turgut Ozal has publicly ruled out a Turkish second front 
against Iraq. But the request for NATO planes sent a message to Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein that his interview broadcast on Turkish television Wednesday, in 
which he appealed for compromise, was falling on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey has taken a strong position against Iraq in the gulf crisis, cutting 
Iraq's oil pipelines, imposing a strict air embargo and deploying extra troops 
along the Iraqi border, tying down nearly 10 Iraqi divisions. Parliament voted 
war powers to the government in September to allow the Cabinet to accept new 
foreign troops in Turkey or to deploy Turkish troops abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Inviting foreign warplanes could either be preparation for attack or merely a 
ploy to keep Hussein guessing, but Turkish officials said the proposal is sure 
to unleash a storm of domestic protest. 
</P>
<P>
Two Cabinet ministers and the chief of the Turkish general staff have resigned 
since August, partly as a result of rifts with President Ozal and his 
single-handed conduct of a staunchly pro-American policy in the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The senior Turkish official said most of any NATO air units sent would be based 
at the big NATO base at Incirlik, where a squadron of U.S. F-15 fighters 
arrived unexpectedly earlier this week. Up to 48 U.S. combat planes are based 
at Incirlik under a longstanding U.S.-Turkish military agreement that provides 
for use of the base for training and defensive purposes only. 
</P>
<P>
"The configuration of the new force is still under discussion in Brussels, but 
my assumption is that it will mainly be air support," said a senior NATO 
diplomat. He dismissed Turkish newspaper reports that NATO ground units would 
be brought into Turkey as well.

MILITARY: A SECRET PARLIAMENT SESSION FUELS SPECULATION THAT BUDAPEST ALSO MAY

Parliament announced Wednesday that a 40-man Hungarian army medical team is 
being readied for service in the Persian Gulf, and a five-hour secret session 
on "matters of national defense" fueled speculation that Hungarian airspace or 
bases might be used in the event of an attack on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary, which has been eager to show solidarity with Western countries in the 
gulf crisis, has available dozens of former Soviet military bases that could 
provide strategic refueling stops about halfway between Iraq and Britain, where 
many of NATO's air force units are based. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies rushed to Parliament Tuesday night, when the government of Prime 
Minister Jozsef Antall called a secret session at 6 p.m. to discuss national 
security and "a wide array of questions related to the gulf crisis," said 
Parliament Speaker Gyorgy Szabad. 
</P>
<P>
The session had been preceded by an extraordinary meeting of the Defense, 
Foreign Affairs and Constitutional committees of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
After the closed-door session that stretched past 11 p.m., Szabad announced 
only that the military medical team that had been proposed months ago had won 
expected parliamentary endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Budapest daily newspaper Nepszabadsag, Szabad was asked by a 
Hungarian journalist if the government had received a request from the United 
Nations Security Council to allow "access to the forces against Iraq to 
Hungarian airspace and airports." 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker said he could make no comment on the subject and suggested that the 
journalist had been exposed to privileged information. 
</P>
<P>
Senior government and opposition figures also would not confirm or deny whether 
Hungary has been approached about cooperating in the event a military strike is 
launched to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only say that what was discussed was a secret of state," said lawmaker 
Gaspar Miklos Tamas of the opposition Alliance of Free Democrats. "In matters 
of national defense, we have to abide by parliamentary policy on 
confidentiality." 
</P>
<P>
Balazs Horvath, a Cabinet minister without portfolio who is seen as the right 
hand of ailing Prime Minister Antall, heightened the atmosphere of intrigue by 
telling reporters that the five-hour debate had produced a "result" that was 
likewise secret. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian President Arpad Goncz made clear during his visit to Washington in 
September that his nation stood ready to play a role in forcing Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein to end his occupation of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the demands of its $21-billion foreign debt and crumbling trade 
network, Hungary has abided by the global embargo against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq owes Hungary $145 million, and additional debts had been forgiven in 
return for Baghdad's promise to ship oil to Hungary -- compensation that has 
been cut off by the trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
Since Antall's government took power after spring elections restored democracy 
to Hungary, the country has sought to reorient its economic, political and 
military ties to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Former Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee in 
Parliament, suggested earlier this year that Hungary be considered for 
membership in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet troops have been moving out of dozens of military sites in Hungary, 
including seven air bases said to be equipped with good runways and refueling 
facilities.

MILITARY: SEN. INOUYE SAYS ANY WAR WITH IRAQ WOULD BE OVER IN FIVE DAYS. VIEWS 
GIVE WHITE HOUSE A BOOST IN CRUCIAL PERIOD.

<P>
During the crucial period leading up to possible military action in the Persian 
Gulf, members of Congress are providing a boost to the White House by returning 
from Pentagon-escorted visits to Saudi Arabia with glowing reports of the 
military's ability to defeat Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally think that if there is war, it will be a short one that will last 
no more than five days," said Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), who met with 
President Bush on Wednesday after a quick trip to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the air power we have there . . . if we cannot gain air superiority 
within six hours, let's say wipe out their missile sites and their 
command-and-control centers within two, three days, then something is wrong 
with our defense structure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Inouye and other members of the House and Senate met with senior-level U.S. 
commanders in Saudi Arabia and with GIs, most of them chosen by officers. The 
Congress members' remarks on returning home serve to reinforce Bush's 
insistence that any combat against Iraq would not turn into another drawn-out, 
Vietnam-like conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The comments, particularly those from Democrats, are providing the White House 
with a unifying image before the January opening of Congress, when a debate on 
gulf policies could resume. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to congressional qualms, as well as public opinion polls that show 
continuing questioning about Bush's goals in the gulf and the readiness of 
Americans to support a war there without giving economic sanctions more time to 
work, Inouye said: "The troops are ready, the commanders are ready, the allies 
are ready. The question is, is America ready?" 
</P>
<P>
The White House offered little comment on the gulf crisis Wednesday. However, 
Vice President Dan Quayle announced he will visit with King Fahd of Saudi 
Arabia in Riyadh and visit with U.S. troops deployed in the gulf from Dec. 29 
to Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle will be the last of the senior Administration officials to visit the 
gulf, after a Thanksgiving Day visit there by Bush, and several trips by 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater did not endorse Inouye's 
assessment, but he didn't quarrel with it, either. 
</P>
<P>
"Our commanders feel confident about their strength and their superiority in 
many areas, their ability to conduct whatever response is necessary in a fast 
and effective fashion. But we would be most reluctant to try to put numbers of 
days on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Anthony C. Beilinson (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House 
Intelligence Committee, who in the past expressed some reservations about the 
size of the gulf operation, seemed less doubtful after his trip to Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent telephone interview from Jerusalem after he met in Saudi Arabia 
with Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of U.S. forces, and visited with 
troops 50 to 60 miles south of the Saudi-Kuwaiti border, Beilinson said "the 
troops were just tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
"(They are) living out literally on the sand in sleeping bags next to tanks or 
armored personnel carriers," he said. "They're proud of themselves and their 
capabilities. They're confident of their ability to do what they're asked to." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was left with "conflicting feelings: on the one hand, you almost 
hope they have an opportunity to prove themselves. They'd really like to show 
how good they are. On the other hand, having met them personally, you come away 
feeling so strongly you don't want to lose a single one of them because they've 
become people to you." 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who traveled with Beilinson, 
said members of the congressional delegation found the morale of the troops so 
surprisingly high that it became a topic of conversation among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of Congress have returned recently with similar reports. This is 
a shift from the days earlier in the deployment when reporters and VIPs 
visiting the troops out of the hearing range of nearby officers were getting an 
earful of complaints about the uncertain length of the mission, about food and 
conditions in general. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a bunch of Rambos out there -- not gung-ho, nuke-'em-type of 
philosophy," Gallegly said. "They're prepared to do what they're asked to do, 
but they're not anxious to get into a war." 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the House just back from Saudi Arabia, Rep. Barbara F. 
Vucanovich (R-Nev.), said morale is good "almost without exception." 
</P>
<P>
But she said of the troops: "They're bored, sitting and waiting, not knowing 
what's going to happen. They all want to fish or cut bait." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly (D-Conn.) said in a statement: "I spoke with Saudi 
commanders at several locations and was impressed by the close and extensive 
cooperation between their command units and U.S. units. My overwhelming 
impression from two days with our forces is that morale is excellent." 
</P>
<P>
But she and others expressed concern that the contributions by other nations in 
the coalition lined up against Iraq are lagging well behind those of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"U.S. ground forces now outnumber allied ground forces -- including the Saudi 
army and national guard -- by a rate of two to one," she said.

ISRAEL ROCKED BY SCANDAL OVER PURCHASE OF U.S. WEAPONS

A major scandal involving allegations of kickbacks and fraud in the purchase of 
U.S. weapons has rocked Israel's air force, implicating a number of senior 
officials as well as several employees of U.S. defense firms, official sources 
and Israeli news reports said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, as many as a dozen senior air force and Defense 
Ministry officials may be charged as a result of a police investigation into 
the air force's procurement of equipment from U.S. contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment was bought with U.S. aid funds. 
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating allegations that millions of dollars were diverted to 
senior Israeli officers. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the investigation is Brig. Gen. Rami Dotan, 45, the Israeli 
air force's quartermaster corps commander until his arrest Oct. 28. He later 
struck a plea-bargain agreement under which he has begun to detail an elaborate 
fraud, Israeli Radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
Following up on Dotan's testimony, authorities Tuesday arrested another officer 
in the quartermaster corps, Col. Yitzhak Sar, on charges of taking bribes and 
obstructing earlier investigations, official sources said. Israeli Defense 
Minister Moshe Arens on Wednesday ordered a full inquiry into the scandal, 
according to the Israeli Embassy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
One American company cited in Israeli press accounts is General Electric, which 
supplied jet engines for Israel's version of the F-16 fighter plane. A GE 
spokesman confirmed the firm is "aware of an investigation by the Israeli 
government" and is conducting its own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
An official source said FBI agents are trying to determine whether U.S. 
citizens or companies violated American laws in the case.

Prosecutor Joseph Paulus had asked that Mark Peterson, 29, not be retried 
because it might be harmful to the victim. Circuit Judge Robert Hawley in 
Oshkosh, Wis., earlier had overturned Peterson's Nov. 8 conviction because the 
defense had not been allowed to have a psychiatrist examine the woman before 
the trial. "The jury verdict, although now set aside on a legal technicality, 
sent a strong message to the community that mentally ill individuals in our 
society must be protected from those who prey upon them," Paulus said.

MAYOR IN UTAH SURVIVES EFFORT TO ERASE TOWN

The Utah town of Big Water was still in business Wednesday, the day after some 
of its citizens failed to get rid of their polygamist libertarian mayor when a 
measure to get rid of the town was voted down. 
</P>
<P>
The vote against disincorporation stood at 101 to 71, including a dozen 
challenged votes, "but with only 12 votes, it wouldn't have made any 
difference," said Dave Hansen, Utah's deputy lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's office joined the attorney general's office in sending election 
monitors to Big Water after charges of illegal registration and vote fraud in a 
1989 election deepened an abiding schism in this dusty retirement town of fewer 
than 400 people, where 54-year-old Alex Joseph has been mayor since the town 
incorporated in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The disincorporation election was not because of Joseph's libertarian politics 
or even his polygamy -- as embarrassing as that is for the town's image, said 
retired businessman Earl Tucker, a leader of the disincorporation campaign. 
Rather, it was over concern that Joseph, his nine wives and various relatives 
and friends were getting a "stranglehold" on the town, holding most public 
offices and local businesses, and doling out a good chunk of the town's paying 
contract jobs to family or friends, Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph said they do the jobs because no one else is willing or qualified.

FEDERAL SUIT ALLEGES CASINO UNION, MOB LINKS

U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh on Wednesday announced a sweeping federal 
anti-racketeering suit seeking a government takeover of a 22,000-member casino 
hotel workers' union based in Atlantic City. The union allegedly is controlled 
by a reputed Mafia crime boss who operates from his federal prison cell. 
</P>
<P>
The suit charges that the Bruno-Scarfo mob family has dominated the union for 
more than two decades and that the current family boss, Nicodemo (Little Nicky) 
Scarfo, continues to direct activities even though he is serving a life 
sentence in an Illinois prison for a 1988 murder and extortion conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The government's complaint, a 77-page, double-spaced document filed in federal 
district court in Newark, claims that the Bruno-Scarfo family has used murder, 
intimidation, extortion, embezzlement and bribery to control Local 54 of the 
Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees International Union. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 19 union officials and reputed mobsters are named as defendants in 
the suit, which seeks the ouster of the local union executive board and its 
replacement by a court-appointed trustee. 
</P>
<P>
Scarfo, who is among the named defendants, allegedly communicates his wishes 
regarding the union and other family operations through his son, Nicodemo 
(Nicky) Scarfo Jr., a frequent prison visitor. The son and the reputed "acting" 
family boss, Anthony (Tony Buck) Piccolo, also are co-defendants in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Local 54 represents bartenders, hotel employees and restaurant workers in 10 
counties in southern New Jersey. Most members work in Atlantic City's casino 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
At the local's Atlantic City headquarters, union officials were conferring with 
their attorneys after announcement of the suit and declined any immediate 
comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
The government's suit is the latest in a string of crackdowns by federal 
prosecutors aimed at ridding organized labor of mob influence. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, a similar suit was filed against six locals of the International 
Longshoremen's Assn. in an effort to end decades of organized crime control of 
the New York-New Jersey waterfront. Last year, the Justice Department also 
announced a landmark settlement with the Teamsters Union to remove mob 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
"Our recent successful efforts against traditional organized crime families has 
given our investigators and prosecutors the necessary information to begin 
prying loose legitimate businesses that have operated under the heavy hand of 
organized crime too long," said Thornburgh, who flew to Newark to announce the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which is a civil rather than a criminal complaint, climaxes a 10-year 
investigation by federal authorities into Local 54's activities. Thornburgh 
said that no arrests would be made because of the civil nature of the case but 
that summons would be served simultaneously on the defendants in several 
states. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks the removal of Local 54 President William Roy Silbert of Somers 
Point, N.J., and five other officials. Silbert allegedly was hand-picked by 
Scarfo to replace Francis Gerace of Scullville, N.J., after Gerace was forced 
to step down by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.

PAPER'S EDITORIAL SPARKS RACIAL UPROAR IN PHILADELPHIA; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: THE INQUIRER ADVOCATED THAT POOR BLACK WOMEN BE ENCOURAGED TO USE NEW 
LONG-TERM BIRTH CONTROL IMPLANTS.

<P>
A furor has erupted in Philadelphia over an editorial by the city's respected 
morning newspaper advocating that poor black women be given "incentives" to use 
new long-term birth control implants. 
</P>
<P>
The editorial, which ran last week in the Philadelphia Inquirer, has spawned 
days of talk radio programs, pickets at the newspaper, and a teary-eyed staff 
meeting Monday in which journalists who grew up in poverty argued that their 
newspaper had advocated that they never be born. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar has also raised the issue of whether having ethnic diversity in 
newsrooms has any meaning if minority voices are ignored. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the Inquirer's editorial board agreed to publish a second 
editorial acknowledging, in the words of editorial board chairman David Boldt, 
"that we were insensitive and counterproductive . . ." In the second editorial, 
the board would be "setting out (again) what we were trying to say," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began last Wednesday when the Inquirer published an editorial, 
"Poverty and Norplant -- Can Contraception Reduce the Underclass." 
</P>
<P>
It argued that "The main reason more black children are living in poverty is 
that the people having the most children are the ones least capable of 
supporting them. . . . There are many ways to fight back. . . . But it's very 
tough to undo the damage of being born into a dysfunctional family. So why not 
make a major effort to reduce the number of children, of any race, born into 
such circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Internal reaction soon broke into print. "Hitler could have written the same 
editorial without pausing to breathe between sentences," wrote columnist Chuck 
Stone in the afternoon Philadelphia Daily News on Tuesday. Both the Daily News 
and the Inquirer are owned by the Knight-Ridder publishing company. 
</P>
<P>
The Inquirer's own metro page columnist Steve Lopez wrote on Sunday that the 
newsroom staff is "often embarrassed by what passes for this newspaper's 
voice," under the direction of Boldt and his deputy Donald Kimelman, the author 
of the editorial. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy dominated the radio talk show of Mary Mason for three days "I 
have been in talk radio for 33 years," said Mason, who is black. "I haven't had 
this kind of thing happen in a very long time." 
</P>
<P>
At the Inquirer, dozens of reporters and editors of all races who were upset 
over the editorial met twice with the paper's editor and the editorial board. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most powerful moment came when Garry Howard, the Inquirer's 
31-year-old black assistant sports editor, spoke to Kimelman in Monday's 
session. Howard grew up in the Mitchell Projects of the south Bronx, one of six 
children in a broken home, raised by a welfare mother. 
</P>
<P>
After grammar school, Howard said, he won an academic scholarship to the 
prestigious Lawrenceville prep school in New Jersey. It was the same school, it 
turned out, from which Kimelman, the son of a U.S. ambassador to Haiti, had 
graduated 11 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are, we are colleagues, we work together, went to same prep school," 
Howard recalled saying. "And the summation of the editorial is that poor women 
on welfare shouldn't have been having so many babies, or that I shouldn't have 
been born." 
</P>
<P>
"I know I am the exception," Howard said in an interview. "But without the 
exception there is no hope. And that is what everyone is entitled to, the 
chance to reach the highest height they can." 
</P>
<P>
Several people cried during the course of the meeting. "I came out of it 
shellshocked," Boldt said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the depth of the uproar, staff members said, is that the editorial 
seemed to reflect the so-called "neo-liberal" ideology and the provocative 
style of the board under Boldt, who has run the paper's editorial pages for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Kimelman and Boldt in fact had written a similar editorial about Norplant on 
Nov. 1, but did not refer to race. 
</P>
<P>
When the second, more pointed editorial was written, at least one editorial 
writer, Rick Nichols, "argued vociferously" against running it. "I think you 
can discuss these kinds of questions," Nichols said, but he complained that the 
editorial made it sound as though high birth rates were the cause of the 
decline of the inner city, rather than a host of other complicated problems. 
</P>
<P>
"By failing to at least allude to this host of problems," Nichols said, "we put 
the blame (on the victim) and that is precisly what David Duke does." Duke is 
the former Ku Klux Klansman and Senate candidate who is currently a member of 
the Louisiana Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The situation was made worse by an exchange of messages between critics and the 
editorial's sponsors, Kimelman and Boldt. Kimelman wrote to one colleague: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm told David Duke has said similar things. . . . Does this make me ashamed. 
No. It helps explain to me why David Duke, in his post-klan incarnation, is 
getting so many votes. He talks publicly about stuff the rest of us only 
reserve for our private conversations." 
</P>
<P>
Black members of the editorial board alleged that their views were being 
deliberately ignored, particularly on issues of poverty, race and urban 
decline, which Boldt and Kimelman said have become a specialty of the editorial 
page. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Lewis, one of three black members of the editorial board, even stopped 
attending meetings "several months ago" in protest. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Branham, another black editorial board member said in an interview 
that, "Whenever we raise (criticisms of their views on poverty and race) there 
is a feeling that 'you can't be objective about this because you are black.' We 
make this big argument at the Inquirer about ethnic diversity, but it does 
absolutely no good if no one listens to what you say." 
</P>
<P>
Max King, the Inquirer editor since only last summer, now admits that running 
the editorial was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he has no plans to follow the recommendation of a minority group of 
staff to replace Boldt.

PENTAGON BACKS OFF ON PREDICTION FOR GENERAL DYNAMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pentagon audit that found General Dynamics has a "possible chance for 
bankruptcy" was revised by Pentagon auditors in recent weeks, some three months 
after they originally made the prediction, it was learned Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear what motivated auditors to change their findings, although 
congressional sources allege that there was pressure brought to bear on the 
Pentagon accountants. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 7, the auditors issued an unusual revision to their original report, 
solely to "delete" the analytical measure that made the bankruptcy prediction 
in the original report, which was issued Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported the findings of the original audit Tuesday; the revision was 
not made available until Wednesday. The deletion was made for technical 
accounting reasons, according to the supplemental audit report. 
</P>
<P>
A companion audit of McDonnell Douglas, which used the same techniques and 
contained similar predictions about bankruptcy, was apparently not revised by 
the agency. "I am not aware of any revision," a McDonnell spokeswoman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The audits, performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, involved an 
examination of the troubled Navy A-12 attack jet program. The audit of General 
Dynamics found that the St. Louis-based firm, the nation's second-biggest 
defense contractor, had fallen into a "weak" financial condition and that its 
"ability to perform this contract may be in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
Those conclusions were not deleted from the revised report. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources questioned whether auditors caved in to political 
pressure resulting from the original audit in deleting the bankruptcy 
prediction. Auditors involved in issuing the reports declined to comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The original audit had begun circulating in the Pentagon by late November. At 
that time, a number of congressional investigators were attempting to obtain 
it, because word had spread that the audit contained a prediction of 
bankruptcy, according to staff members on the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee. The committee has been active in probing the A-12 controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The supplemental audit report said the deletion of the bankruptcy prediction 
was made because the analytical measure, called a z-score, "can only be 
computed using annual data." The original audit used data for the first six 
months of 1990 in rating General Dynamics a "possible chance for bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon auditor who declined to be identified said Wednesday that he has 
often used other than annual data in computing z-scores. But an audit manual 
used by the agency recommends that annual data be used.

IT'S NEVER TOO LATE FOR ELECTRONICS; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: WHEN GOOD GUYS ENTERED THE COMPETITIVE L.A. MARKET, IT DECIDED TO 
BURN THE MIDNIGHT OIL -- AND THEN SOME -- TO DRAW SHOPPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes a customer just doesn't want to be rushed. 
</P>
<P>
Take lab technician Gary Tam, for example. He arrived at the all-night Good 
Guys consumer electronics store on the Westside about 1 a.m. Wednesday to check 
out its selection of car stereo equipment. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until 4:50 a.m. -- after nearly four hours of having a sound room 
largely to himself -- that he wearily wandered to the cashier and plunked down 
some cash to order a $180 pair of speakers. "I'm just so tired, and I felt like 
buying. They sounded good," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
That's hardly the pace at which retailing normally works during these frantic, 
final days of the holiday shopping season. But, then again, Good Guys late at 
night is hardly a normal retailing operation. 
</P>
<P>
At an hour when most retailers are shutting down, the Good Guys location on 
North La Cienega across from the Beverly Center is just getting a fresh surge 
of electricity. It's billed as the world's only 24-hour-a-day consumer 
electronics store. 
</P>
<P>
But why on earth would a consumer electronics merchant want to go to the 
expense of keeping a staff working through the night? And why would any 
audiophile want to investigate the mysteries of woofers and tweeters at 3 a.m.? 
</P>
<P>
To find out, a Times reporter spent the better part of a 10 p.m.-to-10 a.m. 
graveyard work shift at Good Guys. Early on, it was humming, with about 50 
shoppers weaving through the two-story, 20,000-square-foot store. 
</P>
<P>
By 5 a.m., there wasn't a customer in the house, and the staff was watching 
television, checking price tags and good-naturedly shooting the breeze on what 
usually is its slowest night of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the shift, two facts came clear: One, this is not an easy way for 
Good Guys to make money, even as business picks up during the home stretch of 
holiday season. Two, this routine can be an unexpected joy for workers and 
shoppers who enjoy the low-key, unharried tempo of business in the middle of 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a night owl," Tam said. "Where else could I shop this late at night?" 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I'd beat the holiday crush," added Curtis A. Westfall, a lawyer who 
came in before 5 a.m. to buy a palm-size computer. "No traffic. No crowds. 
Personalized service." 
</P>
<P>
The Christmas shopping season is pivotal to Good Guys -- the company counts on 
sales being about 2 1/2 times higher in December than in an average month. With 
bigger rivals Circuit City and newly arrived Silo also fighting hard for 
customers in the Los Angeles-area market this year, Good Guys faces a stiff 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
So far, though, Good Guys executives say their six locations in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties haven't been pinched by competition or recession. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Lee, regional sales manager for Southern California, credits Good Guys' 
buying staff for snapping up many of this Christmas' hottest gifts: portable CD 
players; Turbo Express, Nintendo and other video games; telescopes, 35-mm. 
cameras and the VCR Plus remote-control video programmer. 
</P>
<P>
When Good Guys entered the Los Angeles area with the La Cienega store in July, 
company executives knew they needed something extra to set themselves apart 
from the competition. They consider their customer service a strong point, and 
they wanted to drive that point home. 
</P>
<P>
That's where the 24-hour strategy came in. What better way to tell customers 
that you will bend over backward for them than to keep a store open all night? 
And what better way to grab attention than to have what may be the only 24-hour 
store in the industry? 
</P>
<P>
One of the public relations payoffs came when TV talk show host Arsenio Hall 
mentioned the store on the air and asked his audience why anyone would buy a 
stereo in the middle of the night. "That's the kind of joking we like," Lee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that it was purely a publicity maneuver, company executives say. "You don't 
go through a move like this just for publicity," said Robert A. Gunst, 
president and chief operating officer, based at the Burlingame, Calif., 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that the La Cienega store roughly breaks even on its 10 p.m. to 10 
a.m. shift. Sales slow down at night, but the extra operating expenses are 
minimal. 
</P>
<P>
The store's late-night performance is good enough that the company is promising 
to keep it open round-the-clock and to consider doing the same thing eventually 
at a few of the 30-store chain's other busiest locations. The La Cienega store 
draws traffic from a neighboring all-night Ralphs supermarket, movie theaters 
whose last showings end around midnight and shift changes at nearby 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
There can be a few drawbacks for shoppers. One customer who wanted to buy 
$1,700 of video equipment at night couldn't get his check approved; when he 
returned around 9:45 a.m., he got the OK. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if a salesperson doesn't know the answer to a customer's question, there 
probably is no one else in the department to help. That can be a problem for 
the "techies" who drop in at night. 
</P>
<P>
For employees, security is always a consideration, too. Only one of three doors 
is open at night. As you'd might expect from a consumer electronics store, 
video security cameras stand watch over nearly every corner of the building. 
</P>
<P>
The four nights-a-week work schedules can disrupt personal routines. "I just 
got married," said night manager Tony Carriedo, 29. "This is tough for my 
wife." 
</P>
<P>
At work, though, the staff seems to thrive on the casual, jocular atmosphere. 
When a salesman falls asleep during a slow moment, co-workers are quick to 
record the snoring on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Sales staffers also say they get a kick out of serving the stream of musicians 
and celebrities who frequent the store at night, sometimes to avoid attention. 
Axl Rose, singer for the heavy metal group Guns N' Roses, came in one night 
around 4 or 5 a.m. and bought $6,000 of Bang &amp; Olufsen stereo equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a lot of serious buyers at night," said Michael W. Frazier, a 
gregarious, 7-foot-2 salesman. "If you come in at 2 or 3 in the morning, you're 
coming in to buy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE GOOD GUYS ON LA CIENEGA 
</P>
<P>
Background: Burlingame, Calif.-based chain comprises 30 consumer electronics 
stores. Store on La Cienega is one of its most successful, and it is the only 
store in the chain -- and perhaps in the entire industry -- open 24 hours a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Products: VCR Plus video programmer, portable CD players, Turbo Express, 
Nintendo and other video games, telescopes, 35-millimeter cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Finances: During the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the company's net income rose 
86% to $7.4 million on revenue of $294.0 million, up 51% from the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Employment: 2,000 overall; 100 at the La Cienega store.

INVESTORS YAWN AT DAVIS' CALL FOR FIRST INTERSTATE TO FIND A BUYER; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: THE NUMBER OF PROSPECTIVE BUYERS FOR AN INSTITUTION THIS SIZE IS SMALL 
ALREADY AND SHRINKING FAST. BUT THE L.A. COMPANY IS VULNERABLE TO A PROXY 
FIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly three years, Wall Street has viewed First Interstate Bancorp as a 
ripe takeover candidate waiting to be picked. So when someone with the clout of 
Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis tells the banking firm to shape up or find 
a buyer, one would expect some excitement among investors. 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't happened. A letter that Davis sent last week to First Interstate's 
directors suggesting that it may be the "ideal time" to sell the Los 
Angeles-based banking firm has been greeted with a big yawn. First Interstate's 
stock closed at $25.625 per share on Wednesday, almost exactly the price it 
traded at the day Davis' letter was made public. 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction is ho-hum," said one New York takeover speculator. 
</P>
<P>
The indifference stems from several reasons. Bank acquisitions are anything but 
a sure bet in these uncertain times. The number of prospective buyers for a 
bank the size of First Interstate is small already and shrinking fast because 
banks are struggling with problem loans and pressure to bolster capital. Any 
acquisition or merger would be expensive because it most likely would require 
the buyer to make a big infusion of capital -- funds that serve as a bank's 
financial cushion -- into First Interstate. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, First Interstate executives show no interest in selling. 
Regulators must approve any deal. And the layers of state and federal approvals 
needed to buy First Interstate makes any unfriendly deal virtually impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Still, First Interstate, parent of First Interstate Bank of California, can 
hardly take Davis lightly. Takeover specialists agree that the bank's corporate 
structure makes it more vulnerable than most corporations to pressure through 
either a proxy fight or its cousin, a "consent" solicitation. Both methods are 
used by dissidents to oust directors. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many large corporations, First Interstate never did away with its 
consent solicitation process, which allows dissidents to try to remove 
directors at any time. The bank has also never staggered the terms served by 
its board, so all the directors come up for election at once. So a dissident 
stockholder such as Davis needs only to gain support from those owning more 
than half of First Interstate's shares to replace its directors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, most of First Interstate's shares are held in a handful of 
institutions. That would make it easier for Davis to gather the support he 
needs to replace directors with his own slate. But there is one catch: 
Regulators would have a say in any such move. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate battles are nothing new to Davis, who made his fortune in oil, real 
estate and the film business. Last year, he tried to oust directors of the 
parent of Northwest Airlines before the company was sold to another investment 
group. Indeed, the letter he sent to First Interstate was released publicly by 
D. F. King, a proxy solicitation firm, although there is no evidence that Davis 
has retained the firm specifically for those services. 
</P>
<P>
Under former Chairman Joseph J. Pinola, First Interstate and its lucrative 
branch system throughout the West became the widespread subject of takeover 
rumors. The bank angered shareholders with surprise losses in Texas and its 
continuing high overhead costs. Earlier this year, Pinola turned over the reins 
to Chairman Edward M. Carson and President William E. B. Siart. 
</P>
<P>
Disenchantment by investors and stock analysts has eased some. Last month, 
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. banking analyst Thaddeus W. Paluszek became one of 
the few analysts to recommend the bank's stock to investors. "In our view, 
Carson and Siart are taking the company in the right direction strategically," 
Paluszek said. 
</P>
<P>
The giant investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. bought nearly 10% 
of the stock, agreeing in writing to ally itself with First Interstate until 
1992. Even longtime First Interstate critic John Neff, who controls a large 
chunk of stock through mutual funds he manages, credits the bank with taking 
many of the right steps. He says now that the ideal time to sell First 
Interstate has passed. 
</P>
<P>
Davis declined to comment, as did First Interstate executives. In his letter, 
however, Davis said he believes that the bank's financial condition has 
deteriorated the past few months. Davis also disclosed that he and his family 
"own a significant amount" of First Interstate shares. Stock traders said they 
are puzzled why Davis would go public with that information, adding that they 
believe that it means he wants out of his investment. 
</P>
<P>
"You only go public because you want the stock up," said Tom Barton, a Dallas 
trader who "shorts" bank stocks by betting they will fall. "That means you are 
probably not going to buy any more. Why would you run the stock up if you 
wanted to buy more?" 
</P>
<P>
Working most against any deal now is the growing uncertainty each day about 
banking and the economy. Banking executives say regulators would give 
extraordinary attention to any proposed deal and probably would approve it only 
if the emerging bank had an exceptionally strong balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
Any buyer would also be contending with a slowing economy. As one California 
chief executive puts it, all banks now have "built-in poison pills" -- meaning 
that anyone buying a bank takes a big risk that there are loans that will 
deteriorate badly. First Interstate itself found this out when it bought Allied 
Bancshares in Texas, a bank that turned out to be loaded with small to 
medium-sized loans that were bad. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the number of prospective buyers is shrinking daily. Two banking 
firms once viewed as good candidates to buy First Interstate, Citicorp and 
Security Pacific Corp., have just disclosed they will post huge fourth-quarter 
losses. Japanese banks that might be interested, such as Sanwa Bank, are under 
pressure because of Japan's falling real estate and stock prices. Many large 
regional banks are facing increased problem loans. 
</P>
<P>
That pretty much leaves Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and BankAmerica Corp. as the 
leaders on the short list of banks that analysts believe could do a deal. Both 
are digesting thrift acquisitions and face uncertainties themselves with 
California's slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is going to buy this thing? If Davis forces management to find a buyer, 
will it make a difference?" asked Barton, the Dallas trader. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TAKEOVER: PROS AND CONS 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Davis' letter last week telling First Interstate to shape up or find a 
buyer came after three years of continuous speculation that the banking firm is 
a takeover candidate. Based on interviews with industry executives, 
shareholders, analysts and stock speculators, here are some factors working for 
and against a prospective takeover. 
</P>
<P>
AGAINST A TAKEOVER 
</P>
<P>
* First Interstate executives show no interest in selling. A hostile bid would 
be virtually impossible because of numerous state and federal regulatory 
hurdles that a suitor would have to clear. Nearly 10% is owned by the 
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which has agreed until 1992 
not to vote against management. 
</P>
<P>
* The number of banks, both domestic and foreign, that could pull off an 
acquisition is shrinking rapidly as loan problems surface. 
</P>
<P>
* Any bank is considered a risky acquisition now with the economy softening. A 
buyer might inherit a large number of loans that turn bad. 
</P>
<P>
* Regulators would closely scrutinize any merger and are unlikely to approve 
any deal unless the surviving bank emerges with an exceptionally strong balance 
sheet. Capital that a bank would need to inject to satisfy regulators is 
difficult to raise. 
</P>
<P>
* Some analysts and shareholders have been placated by First Interstate Chief 
Executive Edward M. Carson's moves to try to turn the bank around. 
</P>
<P>
* Bank shares, which would most likely be issued to First Interstate 
shareholders in a merger, are depressed. 
</P>
<P>
FAVORING A TAKEOVER 
</P>
<P>
* Two-thirds of First Interstate's stock is held by a few large institutions, 
with six holding nearly half of it. 
</P>
<P>
* First Interstate could be vulnerable to a proxy fight or similar "consent" 
solicitation because those holding a majority of its shares could oust the 
bank's directors. 
</P>
<P>
* First Interstate's stock is selling at a depressed price, trading at less 
than $25 a share this week. It nearly reached $71 a share in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
* First Interstate has historically been plagued by high overhead costs that 
might be reduced through a merger. 
</P>
<P>
* Wells Fargo &amp; Co., BankAmerica Corp. and Security Pacific Corp. have 
indicated interest in merging with First Interstate for some time. First 
Interstate also represents a rare opportunity for an out-of-state bank to enter 
the West's lucrative banking market.

DEAL KEEPS 'DESIGNING WOMEN' AT CBS FOR YEARS;

CBS Inc. has signed one of Hollywood's top producing teams to a long-term 
contract that will keep the creators of "Designing Women" at the network for up 
to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is the first of its kind for the third-place network, which until now 
has stayed on the sidelines while ABC signed costly series commitments with 
several sought-after production outfits.

CBS has contracted to buy five series through 1998 from Mozark Productions 
Inc., owned by the husband-and-wife team Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and Harry 
Thomason. They created and produce "Designing Women" and "Evening Shade," two 
of the network's most popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, exclusive deals have become increasingly popular 
between networks and proven producers because of the belief that they reduce 
the risk of expensive flops. 
</P>
<P>
ABC has exclusive deals with Steven Bochco, James Brooks and the 
husband-and-wife team of Neal Marlens and Carol Black. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS deal calls for the network to buy five series during the next eight 
years, with minimum orders of 13 episodes for each show. The agreement, which 
will cost the network at least $45 million to $50 million, is exclusive for the 
first three years, after which CBS has a "first look" option. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual twist, CBS will own the fifth show to emerge from the deal. The 
network will also pay the team a $3-million up-front "signing bonus" when the 
deal become effective Jan. 1, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, CBS has committed to finance nearly the entire deficit on each 
series through "non-recourse loans" to Mozark that would not be repayable until 
after a series has been aired for three years. Typically, a network's license 
fee does not cover the full production cost of a show -- a practice in the 
industry known as "deficit financing." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, said the network would 
strike a limited number of such deals in the future with certain valued 
producers. "There are not going to be a string of them," he said. "There will 
just be a few, but they will be large." 
</P>
<P>
The network's willingness to finance nearly the entire deficit of each show is 
significant because it signals a dramatic shift in the relationship between 
independent producers and the major Hollywood studios that supply the 
overwhelming majority of TV programs to the networks. 
</P>
<P>
Producers such as the Thomasons have had to go to the studios to finance the 
deficits on their shows. The studios, in turn, have taken a percentage of the 
rerun profits when the series is eventually sold in syndication. 
</P>
<P>
More important, however, the deal creates some uncertainty in the Thomasons' 
relationship with Columbia Pictures Television, which has a lucrative 
syndication contract for "Designing Women." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the current TV season, 115 episodes of "Designing Women" will 
have been produced, and Columbia is getting ready to sell the re-runs to local 
TV stations or a cable network. Many sitcoms earn $1 million per episode in 
syndication, so the re-run profits for Columbia could be greater than those of 
a blockbuster film. 
</P>
<P>
But with CBS willing to finance a majority of the deficits arising from the 
five-series commitment, there is less incentive for the Thomasons to negotiate 
a distribution deal with Columbia. They could, instead, have an independent 
distributor sell the re-runs for a lower percentage of the profits. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia, however, still has a leg up if it wants the distribution rights to 
the forthcoming Thomason shows -- which easily could be worth hundreds of 
millions of dollars for the studio -- because it can advance them a huge sum 
against syndication proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Columbia advanced the producers Ron Leavitt and Michael Moye 
$34 million against future syndication revenues of "Married With Children."

Few in Aviation on Drugs, Report Shows: Fewer than one-half percent of more 
than 120,000 recent drug tests in the aviation industry showed the presence of 
drugs, the Federal Aviation Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
The tests were conducted among commercial aviation employees ranging from 
pilots to airport security screening personnel, as well as people applying for 
such safety or security sensitive jobs, the FAA said. An analysis of the 
120,642 tests showed drugs in 561, just 0.47% of the total, the FAA said. Of 
the 561, 345 were in pre-employment tests, and those people were not hired for 
sensitive jobs. Employees who tested positive were removed from sensitive 
positions, the agency said.

Ashton-Tate Sued Over dBase: The Torrance-based software firm said it has been 
served with a class-action lawsuit filed by a Pennsylvania partnership, Rudolph 
Palitz, as a representative of those who licensed Ashton-Tate's dBase database 
software products. The lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles, seeks unspecified damages based on alleged practices that caused those 
licensees to pay more than they might have otherwise. Ashton-Tate said that the 
charges are completely without merit and that it will defend vigorously against 
them.

COMPUTER FILE: SOFTWARE TO TRACK PERSONAL CONTACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
If your job puts you in contact with a lot of people, keeping track of them can 
be a big task. How much information can you scribble on to those Rolodex cards? 
Is there another empty spot close at hand for one more yellow Post-it note? 
</P>
<P>
A personal computer loaded with contact management software could make the job 
a lot easier. The best such programs go far beyond being mere electronic 
telephone books or schedulers to help you automate many tasks that result when 
you dial or answer your phone. 
</P>
<P>
I've taken a look at four contact management programs that run on IBM and 
compatible computers with 640 kilobytes of memory and, in most cases, a hard 
disk. 
</P>
<P>
ACT version 2.0, $395 from Contact Software International Inc. in Carrollton, 
Tex., (214) 418-1866, comes with a 60-day satisfaction guarantee and claims 
title to best seller of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Biz*Base, version 2.1, $395 for its "gold" hard-disk model and $99 for the 
less-powerful single floppy disk "silver" version, is offered by Creagh 
Computer Systems in Solana Beach, Calif., (619) 259-7174, with a 30-day 
money-back guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
The Maximizer, version 2.1, $295, from Richmond Technologies &amp; Software 
Inc. in Burnaby, British Columbia, (604) 299-2121, has undergone two 
significant upgrades this year. A network version sells for $695. 
</P>
<P>
Performer, $295, from Performer Systems Inc. in Alhambra, (818) 300-8570, 
offers a series of optional add-on packages to bring even greater automation to 
your tasks. It will run on a single high-density floppy drive if need be. 
</P>
<P>
The contact management software market is highly competitive, and all four of 
these programs have introduced upgraded versions within the past several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
All four have basic features in common. They let you keep detailed lists of the 
people and companies whom you contact. They schedule calls, meetings and other 
activities. You can automatically prepare letters, memos, invoices and other 
forms, properly addressed and personalized with your contact data. 
</P>
<P>
You can search through your lists of data in various ways, such as the person's 
name, company name, city, business category, last date of contact, next 
scheduled contact and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Each has built-in word processing to write letters and other documents. ACT and 
Maximizer include spelling checkers. Once written, letters can be used over and 
over, with appropriate name and address supplied automatically each time. 
</P>
<P>
They all will place telephone calls for you if your computer has a modem. But 
whether you dial or the computer dials, all will let you easily update contact 
information as you talk. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to keeping a history of your dealings with each contact, all of 
these programs will also keep track of your expenses. 
</P>
<P>
All except Maximizer can be suspended temporarily so that you can run other 
software and then return to the same point you were when you left. Each has 
many other features, some in common and others unique. 
</P>
<P>
ACT, an acronym for automated contact tracking, is a program for people who 
can't or don't want to type. Nearly everything, including sending letters or 
virtually any other document or form, can be accomplished with just a few 
keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
Every part of the program is tied to the contact records, which provide basic 
identification data, including space for the secretary's name, plus 29 
user-defined fields. 
</P>
<P>
Performer is a solid middle-of-the-road program and is the quickest of the four 
to begin using. A thorough but simple tutorial section in the reference manual 
gives you the essentials in about 10 minutes. After that, a well-designed set 
of menu choices and on-screen prompts will let you easily use what you have 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
Two screens full of data can be stored for each contact, which is typical of 
all of these programs. Performer allows you to define 31 fields, all on the 
second screen, with your own category names. 
</P>
<P>
Biz*Base Gold, version 2.1, is organized around a time management system that 
keeps track of all your activities. When the program opens, your day is laid 
out for you on a screen divided into four sections labeled "recalls," 
"follow-ups," "calendar" and "task scheduler." 
</P>
<P>
Recalls and follow-ups are similar, yet also different. You designate a recall 
when you want to call a client at a particular time for a particular purpose. A 
follow-up is scheduled for clients to whom you have already talked or mailed a 
letter or sent a shipment or whatever. Both are entered from the contact record 
so that they become part the history of your dealings with that person. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment list suffers a serious limitation because the only times 
allowed are in half-hour intervals from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
That is one of the few limitations, however. Biz*Base gives you the ability to 
redefine most of the 50 fields of information that it will store about each 
person. It also includes a word processor, a calculator and modem program. 
</P>
<P>
It has a cluttered appearance and is complicated. But if you are an experienced 
computer user and maybe have been thinking about creating your own contact 
management software, Biz*Base is the would-be hacker's delight. 
</P>
<P>
Maximizer utilizes pop-up menus that sprout at various locations on your 
screen, depending on what portion of the program you are using. But you'll have 
to memorize the keys needed for basic functions because there is no on-screen 
prompting system to help you. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line on contact management is that any of these programs will make 
the task easier. But only if you use them often. 
</P>

FREEBIES REPLACING ADS AT THE MOVIES; 
</P>
<P>
THEATERS: TO MAKE UP FOR REDUCED REVENUE FROM ON-SCREEN ADS, CHAINS ARE 
CHARGING COMPANIES TO DISTRIBUTE PRODUCT SAMPLES TO FILMGOERS.

Next time you hand your ticket to the usher at the movie theater, don't be 
surprised if you're handed back a candy bar -- or bar of soap. 
</P>
<P>
In-theater product sampling is about to take off in Los Angeles and other 
cities. Last weekend, many United Artists theaters in the Los Angeles area -- 
and nationwide -- began giving patrons free PB Max candy bars, a new Mars Inc. 
brand. And next week, some UA theaters in the Dallas area will dole out free 
packs of Smart Foods popcorn to all theatergoers. Other theater chains also 
have plans to step up product sampling programs. 
</P>
<P>
Why the sudden freebies? Well, earlier this year film studios Walt Disney Co. 
and Warner Bros. banned theater chains from showing on-screen advertisements 
before their films. As a result, some chains are scrambling for new ways to 
boost ad revenue. It could mean a boon for freebies at the movies. 
</P>
<P>
"The reduction of on-screen advertising is going to hurt us," said Cathy 
Kasberg, director of promotions and marketing at UA, the nation's largest 
theater chain, with 2,500 screens in 515 locations. "Hopefully, this can give 
us another avenue for income." 
</P>
<P>
By one estimate a nationwide sampling of a single product at a major chain can 
generate up to $100,000 in extra advertising revenues in one month. That's well 
over $1 million per year. Instead of paying for time on screen, advertisers pay 
theaters to hand out their products. 
</P>
<P>
UA hopes to lure business away from others by becoming the movie chain people 
associate with free gifts. "Nine out of 10 people don't even know which theater 
company owns the theater they go to," said Kasberg. "This is one way to stand 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Marketing experts say freebies rank among the very best kind of advertising. 
"People love free samples," said Susan Small-Weil, a specialist in consumer 
behavior at the New York ad agency Warwick Baker &amp; Fiore. "In this case, 
advertising isn't an uninvited guest. It's a welcome guest." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the UA chain wants to entice customers by handing out different 
samples every weekend. But they certainly won't be limited to candy bars and 
popcorn. Kasberg said the theater chain is considering everything from bars of 
soap to ballpoint pens to frozen yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
But competitors say they won't be outdone. Cineplex Odeon, the Toronto-based 
chain which ranks No. 2 in the United States, with 1,690 screens in 415 
locations, says it has tested product sampling since 1986, handing moviegoers 
everything from packages of sugar-free Dentynechewing gum to samples of Hero 
men's cologne. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex Odeon, however, hands out its samples when customers exit the theater. 
"If someone doesn't like a product," explained Howard Lichtman, executive vice 
president of marketing, "we don't want them leaving it on the floor."

JUDGE DROPS 'WHISTLE-BLOWER' LAWSUIT AGAINST HUGHES; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE DEFENSE CONTRACTOR SETTLED WITH A FORMER ENGINEER WHO ACCUSED IT 
OF INSTALLING DEFECTIVE WEAPONS PARTS.

<P>
A federal judge has dismissed a $9.6-billion "whistle-blower" lawsuit filed by 
a former Hughes Aircraft Co. engineer in Fullerton who accused the defense 
contractor of installing defective microchips in several weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed by former engineer Michael C. Denlinger in June, 1989, was 
dismissed Dec. 5 in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana at the request of Hughes 
and with the consent of Denlinger. Hughes announced the dismissal Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a settlement, but I can't disclose the terms," said William 
Humphreys, an attorney for Denlinger. "It was not dismissed on the merits of 
the case. It was impossible for my client to continue." 
</P>
<P>
Humphreys said his client believes that the suit has merit but decided to drop 
it because of the emotional and financial strain of the legal battle. Humphreys 
said Denlinger is unemployed and had accumulated more than $30,000 in legal 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Dore, a Hughes spokesman, said that the Denlinger suit was "frivolous" 
and that the problem "had been resolved to the point that even our customers 
recognized it." Dore said the agreement to dismiss the case did not involve a 
cash settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Denlinger had filed the suit under the federal False Claims Act, accusing 
Hughes of covering up flaws in more than 4 million microchips installed in 
defense systems since 1984. The suit claimed damages of $3.2 billion, an amount 
that under federal law could have been trebled. 
</P>
<P>
After a nine-month investigation, the Justice Department in February declined 
to join in the suit against Hughes. Denlinger then pursued the lawsuit on his 
own. The suit was dismissed on a procedural matter in April and refiled in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Hughes filed a motion to dismiss the case, citing evidence that 
the problem claimed by Denlinger was solved with the cooperation of the 
Department of Defense and other companies years before the suit was filed, Dore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes officials said the company and its suppliers discovered in 1985 that a 
part known as a dual in-line package integrated circuit would sometimes crack 
when subjected to certain manufacturing processes. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it then corrected the manufacturing problem and inspected all 
inventories to remove any potentially defective circuits. Hughes provided 
extended warranties on its equipment sold to the government, Dore said. 
</P>
<P>
Denlinger had claimed that the defective microchips had been used in a variety 
of weapons systems, including Navy submarine torpedoes and shipboard 
electronics systems. Humphreys contended Wednesday that some faulty chips 
manufactured before 1985 are still being used in U.S. military equipment.

<P>
Wall Street's celebration over the Federal Reserve's long-awaited cut in the 
discount rate proved short-lived Wednesday as investors returned their focus to 
the anemic economy. 
</P>
<P>
Investors were waiting for major banks to cut their prime lending rates in the 
wake of the Fed's action, but the cuts never came. Also, the bond market rally 
reversed course. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index closed unchanged at 2,626.73. The last time the 
Dow closed at the same level two days in a row turned out to be a bad omen: On 
July 16 and 17 the Dow finished at 2,999.75 -- which remains the all-time high. 
Unable to break the magic 3,000 mark on those two attempts, the Dow trended 
lower later in July, then plunged with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The broader market was more upbeat Wednesday. Gaining issues on the New York 
Stock Exchange beat losers 845 to 686. Volume was 180.4 million shares, 
compared to 176.5 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Fed cut the discount rate, which it charges member banks for 
short-term loans, to 6.5% from 7%. It was an attempt to push cash into the 
sluggish economy to boost growth, and investors cheered the news by sending the 
Dow up 33.41. 
</P>
<P>
But in the aftermath, the stalemate in the Middle East and continued 
indications of a soft economy are giving stocks little incentive to gain 
further. 
</P>
<P>
"People are looking at the fundamentals, which are not that good," said Jay 
McElroy, principal at 1838 Investment Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley Turner, chairman of McDonald &amp; Co.'s investment policy committee, 
said, "I still say the overriding consideration of investors is the tone of 
fourth-quarter earnings." Investors won't see those reports until mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Many tech stocks continued to surge on hopes for an improving economy. AST 
Research, up 5 1/2 Tuesday on a strong earnings forecast, gained 1 5/8 to a 
52-week high of 33 5/8. That marks a new all-time high as well for the Irvine 
personal computer maker. It had traded at 32 3/4 in the late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced Logic jumped 1 3/4 to 10 3/4, Seagate Tech rose 7/8 to 11 3/4, 
Autodesk added 1 3/4 to 49 3/4 and Borland International gained 1 1/4 to 30 
3/4. El Monte-based electronics distributor Marshall Industries inched up 1/8 
to 21 1/2 after reporting a slip in quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
* Some industrial stocks rose on economic hopes as well. Alcoa jumped 1 1/8 to 
58 7/8, Caterpillar gained 1 to 46 7/8 and Clark Equipment added 1 1/8 to 26 
1/4. Chrysler rose 1/2 to 14 1/8, continuing to gain on news this week of 
investor Kirk Kerkorian's 9.8% stake. 
</P>
<P>
* Bank stocks, big winners Tuesday as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, 
continued to rally, though less briskly. BankAmerica was up 1 5/8 to 26 5/8, 
and Wells Fargo added 5/8 to 58 3/8. But Citicorp dropped 7/8 to 13 1/4 and 
Security Pacific was flat at 22. 
</P>
<P>
Some home builders gained on expectations that housing will revive with lower 
rates. Kaufman &amp; Broad added 5/8 to 9 3/4 and Centex gained 1 1/8 to 31 
1/8. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks firmed in thin trading on the back of a higher opening on 
Wall Street. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index rose 16.9 to close at 
2,178.7. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended 1.4% lower after opening slightly firmer. The 
30-share DAX index fell 20.17 to 1,457.24, its lowest close since Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed higher in robust trading after the benchmark Nikkei 
index rose above 25,000 for the first time since Nov 1. 
</P>
<P>
Prices soared after a cut in the U.S. discount rate reinforced expectations of 
lower rates in Japan, but the rally lost energy later. The 225-share Nikkei 
rose 452.76 to close at 24,876.78. At midday today the Nikkei was off 126.24.

Profit Taking Pulls Down Bond Prices 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices dropped sharply Wednesday as traders took profits following a 
strong rally Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The government's bellwether 30-year bond dropped 1 5/32 points late Wednesday, 
or $11.56 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield rose to 8.17% from 8.07% late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's steep price fall came after a surge the day before on news the 
Federal Reserve had cut the discount rate, a key rate paid by banks, to 6.5% 
from 7%. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's move was an attempt to inject life into a sluggish economy by 
encouraging banks to lower interest rates on loans. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Fed acted again Wednesday, injecting reserves into the 
banking system to further reduce the benchmark federal funds rate 1/4 point to 
7%. 
</P>
<P>
But many bond traders still decided it was time to lock-in profits. The bond 
market has been rallying since October on expectations of Fed moves to lower 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Ends Mixed; Focus on Mark 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished mixed in domestic trading Wednesday as fears of Mideast war 
overrode concern about lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Trading focused on the mark, with most players expecting German interest rates 
to stay firm. 
</P>
<P>
In New York the dollar settled at 134.05 Japanese yen, up from 132.72 on 
Tuesday. But against the German mark the dollar was virtually flat at 1.478. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Gold, Silver Climb on Fed Rate Cut 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Federal Reserve to cut its discount rate sent gold and 
silver soaring on New York's Comex. 
</P>
<P>
Gold jumped $9.50 to $10.10, with the contract for delivery in February at $388 
an ounce; silver rocketed 13.2 to 14.1 cents with December at $4.10 an ounce; 
platinum was 50 cents to $7.70 higher, with December at $416.40 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said prices responded to the potential for a turnaround in the economy, 
which could help raise industrial consumption of the metals and boost 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, crude oil for February closed 1 cent higher at $26.93 a barrel on 
the NYMEX after pulling back from a high of $27.45.

AS HOSTILITIES LOOM IN THE GULF, DHAHRAN INTERNATIONAL SUDDENLY FINDS ITSELF 
HOSTING THE WORLD'S JOURNALISTS. AND LIKE WAR HOTELS OF THE PAST, 
INTERNATIONAL'S REPUTATION MAY SOON REACH STORIED PROPORTIONS.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every war produces a legendary hotel. 
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam, it was the Caravel; in Lebanon, the Commodore; in El Salvador, the 
Camino Real. Their fame was born not from fine cuisine nor pampered service, 
but merely because this was where correspondents who covered the war lived, 
drank, worked, and sought companionship and truth. 
</P>
<P>
Often the frayed remnants of a bygone colonial era, the favored hotels lived on 
a last hurrah in a moment of high drama. Yet even in the toughest times, they 
provided the war correspondents' staples: communications, information, alcohol 
and safety -- generally in that order. 
</P>
<P>
When the city was blacked-out, the staff found generators to keep the lights 
burning. When the streets were dangerous, to step into the hotel's foyer was to 
be secure. When it was seemingly impossible to find a communications link with 
the home office in Europe or the United States, the hotel's telexes chattered 
away as reliably as Swiss watches. 
</P>
<P>
Now journalists have gathered again, 350 of them at last count, to record the 
drumbeat of threatened war. Many are veterans of wars and revolutions in Latin 
America, Africa and the Middle East, a few of Vietnam -- but only a few because 
the years have slipped by more quickly than most have realized. And the hotel 
that is to them what the Caravel was in Saigon is a mint-on-your-pillowcase, 
marbled retreat, the Dhahran International. 
</P>
<P>
It seems a bit out of place with the boozy, tattered character of its 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
In normal times, the 200-room, $85-a-night International is a businessman's 
hotel where guests such as then-Vice President George Bush, Libyan dictator 
Moammar Kadafi and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have dined on fricassee de 
fruits de mer au saffron and lamb kabobs. 
</P>
<P>
What nobody worried about in those quieter times was the International's 
exceedingly dangerous location. Well within range of Iraqi missiles, it sits on 
the perimeter of a major air base, close to huge containers of petroleum and a 
collection of TV dishes and antennas. 
</P>
<P>
But the hotel's general manager, Gunther Baehr, and his staff of 300 -- which 
includes Egyptians, Tunisians, Jordanians, Thais, Pakistanis, Indians, 
Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, Moroccans, a handful of Saudis in executive 
positions and an Irish chef -- have responded like battle-scarred veterans to 
the challenge of running what could become a war-time hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a rare opportunity to witness a turning point in history," Baehr said 
while journalists down the hall were dismantling the ceiling to accommodate TV 
cables. "Everyone's concerned for his own safety, yet there is something in a 
crisis that binds everyone, the staff and the guests, together. For instance, 
I'm on a first-name basis with a lot of the guests, and that wouldn't happen in 
normal times." 
</P>
<P>
Baehr's job has no doubt been made easier because the stiffest drink served in 
Dhahran is a kandana fizz -- orange juice and nonalcoholic sparkling white wine 
in a martini glass -- and by the absence of quasi-journalistic war junkies who 
usually find their way into foreign battle zones. The Saudis' rigid visa 
controls have kept the groupies at bay, and the alcohol ban has produced what 
must be the most conservative and well-behaved buildup of journalists -- and 
soldiers -- in military history. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I welcome the chance to come up to Saudi and get off the sauce for a 
while," said one European correspondent based in Cairo. "I always cope better 
than I think I will. "What I miss, though, is the camaraderie and exchange of 
information you get in a bar. You just don't get that same interaction in a 
coffee shop. . . . This whole atmosphere is very sterile compared to what it 
was like in Vietnam or Beirut." 
</P>
<P>
The journalists, who now need computer jacks as much as they once did telexes, 
have converged on the Dhahran International because its Grand Banquet Hall 
houses the U.S. military's Joint Information Bureau. A collection of 35 
officers and sergeants, the bureau coordinates field trips and escorts small 
groups of correspondents to various units scattered through the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Vietnam, the military has kept a tight reign on journalists, forbidding 
them unaccompanied access to units and soldiers. The competition is so keen to 
secure one of the 10 or 15 spaces available on any escape from the hotel that 
40 journalists tried to sign up for a day with Chief Warrant Officer Wesley 
Wolf, who visits units in a catering truck, selling "Wolfburgers." (NBC has 
hired the wife of an American oil worker to sit by the board where future trips 
are posted; her sole job is to pencil in the names of an NBC crew at the top of 
each list.) 
</P>
<P>
And because the journalists are at the Dhahran International, the Kuwaitis are 
too, in a suite staffed by volunteers who try to keep Iraq's atrocities in the 
world's conscience. 
</P>
<P>
They sell T-shirts that say, "See You In Kuwait," arrange interviews with 
Kuwaitis who have escaped Iraqi occupation, and distribute videos of Kuwait, 
before and after. The posters they have taped to walls in the hotel show 
gallant fighters, teary-eyed children and hands raised in victory salutes. A 
visitor who did not speak Arabic might think he was looking at something 
published by the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"We have suffered more than the Palestinians because their suffering has been 
gradual and ours has been sudden," said a Kuwaiti named Saqar whose family 
remains in Kuwait. "We were born to wealth and dignity, and suddenly we are 
jobless, homeless, moneyless. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of an American going to work one morning and by the evening he has lost 
everything. Everything. We found ourselves in 24 hours with nothing. We didn't 
even have time to go to the bank and draw out some money." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors float through the hotel these days that a deal may be in the works to 
give the Kuwaitis back their country. In the lobby, where fountains flow with 
gurgling water, guests sip Turkish coffee and discuss these reports amid the 
piped-in sounds of "Danny Boy." Upstairs, in the banquet hall, the television 
set, tuned to the U.S. Armed Forces network, shows a pro football game, live 
from the United States. Johnny Carson will be on later. 
</P>
<P>
It is the twilight zone between war and peace. The hotel staff scurries about, 
emptying ashtrays, slipping faxes from offices in Los Angeles, London and Tokyo 
under journalists' doors. 
</P>
<P>
All of life seems to blur into a single memory of too many wars in distant 
lonely lands. The Caravel. The Commodore. The Intercontinental. Camino Real. 
The Dhahran International -- whose staff and guests now attend nightly seminars 
about how to survive air attacks and chemical warfare -- has not yet earned its 
stripes as a member of that select wartime fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
And, one hopes, it never will.

DRIVING MISS ODESSA;

<P>
CIVIL RIGHTS: ROSA PARKS CALLS THE FILM IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS 
NEGLECTED THE SUBJECT FOR TOO LONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
At Tom Bradley's birthday party last week, Herbie Hancock, Lionel Richie and 
Robert Guillaume rushed up to pay their respects to her. At the Century City 
premiere of "The Long Walk Home," her name drew as much applause as the film's 
stars, Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek. 
</P>
<P>
These are hardly moments that the 77-year-old Rosa Parks could have imagined 35 
years ago, when she refused to move to the back of a bus in Montgomery, Ala., 
and inadvertently started the Montgomery bus boycott -- one of the seminal 
events of the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
Parks' literal sit-in in 1955 also provided the dramatic spark for Richard 
Pearce's "The Long Walk Home," the story of a proper Southern matron (Spacek) 
and her black maid (Goldberg), whose lives are irrevocably transformed by acts 
of conscience. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old Parks, dressed in a simple beige floral dress for this 
interview in the Art Deco library of the St. James's Club on the Sunset Strip, 
soft-sells her role in history. "Everyone who lives makes history," she says. 
"Much of it just isn't written or made public." 
</P>
<P>
She was 42, a tailor's assistant in a local department store when she was 
arrested for refusing to move to the back of the bus. She never paid her $14 
fine, nor did she ride on a public bus again until they were desegregated more 
than a year later. 
</P>
<P>
There is no Rosa Parks character in "The Long Walk Home," but news of her 
arrest sets the dramatic events in motion. In the movie, Spacek's Miriam 
Thompson and Goldberg's Odessa Cotter have the '50s version of a Southern 
master-slave relationship -- respectfully distanced -- but they become bonded 
as they are both politicized by the boycott. Eventually, they unite against an 
angry white mob that includes Thompson's own husband. 
</P>
<P>
Parks gives the movie a mixed review. She says it's "a well-written story," a 
great improvement as a civil-rights movie over "Mississippi Burning," "which 
presented the FBI as heroes, when we knew it was not so." She calls "The Long 
Walk Home" an important film because the United States has neglected the 
subject for too long. 
</P>
<P>
"Young people particularly can learn the lesson that as long as we let race 
relations stand in the way of humanity, we won't make the progress we should," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Parks, who was not consulted on the project, takes issue with certain 
aspects of the film. 
</P>
<P>
"The tone is right, the events could have happened, but to my knowledge, there 
were no white women who actually drove in the car pools (organized to assist 
blacks boycotting the public bus system)," she says. "Also, the mob scene 
ending was very 'Hollywood.' People adamant about harassing blacks wouldn't 
have been affected by someone stepping forward to sing a song. They just 
weren't Christian enough to fall silent." 
</P>
<P>
A film about Parks' life is in development with Magnusfilms, and she hopes it 
will be more "authentic." No decision has been made about an actress to portray 
her, but her own wish list includes Cicely Tyson, Alfre Woodard and Denise 
Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
New Visions Pictures and the distributor, Miramax Films, who brought Parks to 
Los Angeles for the premiere, are loath to debate the merits of the $7-million 
film with her. However, a New Visions official did respond to her criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"(Spacek's character) is an amalgam of white men and women who took various 
actions in support of the boycott," says Jane Russell, director of marketing. 
"If white women didn't drive, then we have documented evidence that white males 
did. It's a movie, and the ending was a dramatic choice -- a conglomeration of 
real-life incidents." 
</P>
<P>
Called the mother of the modern civil-rights movement, Parks has been in the 
spotlight ever since her arrest. She has spoken at schools and universities, 
been active in the NAACP and was a staff assistant to Rep. John Conyers 
(D-Mich.) from 1965 until her retirement two years ago. She is currently at 
work on three autobiographies -- two for children to be published by Dial Press 
and one for adults for Time-Life Books. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she was disheartened by the civil-rights setbacks of the '80s, 
Parks responds: "It is, or can be, discouraging . . . but I refuse to permit 
myself to feel that all is lost. We have to look at the good that has been 
accomplished because focusing on the negative is too overpowering."

Like 1988's "Mississippi Burning," this year's "The Long Walk Home" is another 
case of Hollywood's telling it like it wasn't about the struggle by blacks to 
throw off the cruel shackles of the Southern segregation system. 
</P>
<P>
"Mississippi Burning" was a grievously distorted version of the 1964 
assassination of three civil-rights workers in Philadelphia, Miss. "The Long 
Walk Home" is a grossly misleading and sentimentalized sugar-coated version of 
the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott. 
</P>
<P>
That Hollywood, in its latest mini-fad, is at last paying some attention to the 
civil rights struggle is a good thing. The problem -- or my problem, anyway -- 
with these movies is that they are being presented as somewhat fictionalized 
but historically accurate versions of actual events. 
</P>
<P>
"The Long Walk Home" purports to tell us what happens in rigidly segregated 
Montgomery ("the cradle of the Confederacy") when one white upper-class Country 
Club housewife/mother-of-two, Mrs. Norman Thompson (Sissy Spacek), undergoes a 
180-degree moral turnaround that begins when her longtime maid, Odessa (Whoopi 
Goldberg) is called "nigger" and is run out of a white park where she's been 
deposited to baby-sit the Thompson children. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Thompson uses her political clout and social position to force the abusive 
cop to apologize to her and the maid, which he does, even addressing the maid 
as "Mrs. Cotter." That a white Southern cop, or any white person, for that 
matter, would apologize to any black person for anything -- even a killing or 
lynching -- was extremely unlikely in that era. And to address a black woman as 
"Mrs."? As Gov. George Wallace would have put it, that would have been as 
likely as finding socks on a rooster. 
</P>
<P>
The North Carolina newspaper where I cut my teeth as a reporter in the '50s 
would have gotten around the "Mrs." problem -- as would have other papers -- in 
this case by calling the maid "Odessa Cotter" in the first paragraph and "the 
Cotter woman" thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
When in this movie the bus boycott begins (we hear Martin Luther King Jr.'s 
eloquent call to arms from inside the SRO church while Odessa and her family 
stand in a crowd outside), Mrs. Thompson's husband walks out, and she is 
suddenly isolated with her two little girls. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of caving in, she pluckily turns her back on security, tradition, 
upbringing and social acceptance and actually joins the boycott by using the 
family station wagon to car-pool black workers around Montgomery -- even 
putting them in the front seat with her. At movie's end, we see a threatened 
Mrs. Thompson and Odessa holding hands and silencing and facing down a raving 
mob of whites with only the quiet strength and dignity of their moral 
superiority. 
</P>
<P>
Could anything like this have actually happened in the South during the '50s or 
'60s? Utterly and completely impossible. 
</P>
<P>
In all of my years of coming of age as a reporter in my native South in the 
'50s, and covering all of the major civil-rights stories for Newsweek in the 
'60s, I knew of only a very, very rare upper-class Southern white woman who 
spoke out even tentatively against the brutalities and inequities visited on 
black people. Marching? Protesting? Holding hands, or even meeting with blacks? 
Boycotting? Not a chance. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't that all Southern white women -- or all white men -- were deep-dyed 
racists. But the intimidation -- the spoken and unspoken threat of 
cross-burnings, beatings, burnings, social ostracization, loss of money and 
position -- was too great and too all-pervasive. As Martin Luther King Jr. 
often pointed out, whites were as much victims of the system of segregation as 
blacks -- though certainly not so brutally used by it. 
</P>
<P>
So to present in a movie that a well-meaning white woman and her rather passive 
maid could actually defeat a white mob and score a major triumph against 
segregation is about as far from reality as one could get. 
</P>
<P>
Well, so what to these Hollywood variations from what actually happens? What's 
the big deal, as long as the evils of segregation are illuminated in a 
compelling drama (which, by the way, this is not)? 
</P>
<P>
Well, whole new generations of young people are being introduced to these 
important American historical events for the first time through movies. And 
what is the main message conveyed to these virgin minds by both "Mississippi 
Burning" and "The Long Walk Home"? 
</P>
<P>
The main message, in both pictures, is that white people are the heroes, that 
blacks were only background players. "Mississippi Burning" was about two heroic 
FBI agents, when in fact the FBI's role was anything but heroic, a mere 
delivering of a $30,000 bribe to an informer. In "The Long Walk Home," a white 
woman is the central heroic figure, when in fact it was only the bravery and 
the bloodshed of black people in Montgomery that broke bus segregation and 
launched a bloody 10-year struggle that eventually overcame, at the cost of 
dozens of black lives, the meaner aspects of segregation in the South. 
</P>
<P>
That's the trouble with "The Long Walk Home. It just sends black people, one 
more time, to the back of the bus.

KCET LABEL ON 'SOUTH AFRICA NOW' CALLED UNFAIR; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: IT WILL BE THE ONLY PROGRAM TO CARRY A 'POINT OF VIEW' TAG. 'IT 
PUTS THE ONUS ON US TO PROVE THAT WE'RE NOT BIASED,' SAYS THE PRODUCER. 
</P>

<P>
The decision by Los Angeles public-television station KCET to label the 
news-magazine "South Africa Now" a "point of view" program is unfair because it 
calls into question the show's credibility, the program's producer and 
community supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts the onus on us to prove that we're not biased, and I think that's 
unfair," said producer Danny Schechter, who with partner Rory O'Connor produces 
"South Africa Now" for Globalvision in New York. "Public television is loaded 
down with programs that reflect conservative and right-wing perspectives. To my 
knowledge, not one of them has been labeled 'point of view' or 'commentary' 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Schechter said, William F. Buckley, host of "Firing Line," and 
Louis Rukeyser, host of "Wall Street Week," present avowedly conservative 
philosophies on their shows. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 28 spokeswoman Barbara Goen confirmed that "South Africa Now" will be 
the only program on its schedule to carry the "point of view" label. 
</P>
<P>
KCET's decision is the latest move in an ongoing controversy over the 2 
1/2-year-old program. Station officials drew fire from community groups and 
members of its own advisory board in October, when vice president Stephen 
Kulczycki canceled the series, saying it was biased in favor of the African 
National Congress. Program supporters complained that they would be deprived of 
one of the few regular sources of information about the lives of black South 
Africans. Kulczycki changed his mind and decided to keep the series on the air 
for a six-week trial period, saying that the most recent installment had not 
shown the favoritism he'd seen earlier. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the station announced that it would continue broadcasting the 
program this season, but, beginning this week, it would be labeled a "point of 
view." The series airs Sundays at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Because 'South Africa Now' does not consistently meet KCET standards for 
fairness and balance in news programming, the station will identify it on the 
air as a 'point of view' program as long as we feel such identification is 
appropriate," KCET president William Kobin said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
The label will appear on the screen at the beginning of each program. Goen said 
that the station had not yet decided on the precise wording, but she said it 
would likely identify the point of view expressed on the show as that of 
Globalvision's. 
</P>
<P>
David Horowitz, chairman of a conservative media watchdog group called the 
Committee on Media Integrity, who earlier had claimed credit for bringing the 
idea that the show was biased to KCET's attention, said that while he would 
prefer that "South Africa Now" be taken off the air, it should be labeled if it 
is broadcast. He said that he had suggested as much in letters and meetings 
with station executives. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Wilkins, a Los Angeles anti-apartheid activist who has tangled with KCET in 
the past over "South Africa Now," said that he thinks KCET is labeling the 
program in an effort to save face after making public claims that the program 
was biased. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a point of view," Wilkins said. "KCET is wrong. It's just news and 
nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
"South Africa Now" will be producing new programs until April. The show had 
been expected to run out of money in January, but last month, supporters, 
including Bill Cosby, donated enough money to keep it on the air.

<TEXT>
<P>
From a distance, the crowds, police cars and barricades create the impression 
that we're in a hostage situation here. But then The Glow comes into sight, and 
the faint sounds of singing chipmunks are heard. . . . 
</P>
<P>
At Dahlia Circle and Shadbush Street, The Glow comes not only from the 
neighborhood's mind-boggling Christmas lights and mechanical displays but from 
the faces of the thousands of children and adults who come year after year to 
see these dazzling salutes to the yuletide. 
</P>
<P>
"My family has been coming for the last three Christmases," said Jerry Sulvain 
of Long Beach, holding his 10-month-old son, Sean. "It gives me a warm feeling. 
And my kids love it." 
</P>
<P>
Not more than 10 feet away, 6-year-old John Sulvain was mesmerized by a 
mechanical doll throwing a snowball at a little blond-haired doll, who turns 
around when she's hit. Little Johnny "hasn't moved from that spot in 15 
minutes," his father said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
This is exactly the kind of reaction that Joe and Betty Finnell are after. 
</P>
<P>
"We would never consider not decorating the house," said Betty Finnell, 56, who 
remembers back when the decorating only took one day. "We've been doing this 
for about 20 years, and with each passing year, the decorating became more 
elaborate. This year, my husband started to put things up before Thanksgiving." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to believe the decorating didn't take even longer than that. On the 
Finnells' roof and in their front yard, Santa snaps his whip to a team of 
reindeer, elves work busily on a line of toys, and dolls dance. Throughout the 
display, a galaxy of multicolored lights produces an almost Vegas-like glitter. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Finnell doesn't know how many lights are up (some residents estimate 
15,000), or the number of electronic components and amount of wiring used in 
her displays. But she does know about the electric bill -- $150 from Dec. 1 
through Dec. 26 (almost three times as much as it is during those months her 
house isn't lit up like, well, a Christmas tree). Other neighbors say electric 
bills of $350 are not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
This year, for the first time, the city has put up barricades and dispatched 
police officers to make sure that the only vehicles allowed into the 
neighborhood are those that belong there. Outsiders are welcome to park at the 
nearby Recreation and Cultural Center at 16400 Brookhurst St., where they can 
walk in. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year," explains Police Lt. Bob Mosely, "it was virtual gridlock. We 
estimate we got 7,000 people coming in here over a 10-day period." 
</P>
<P>
"We had to act," adds Assistant City Manager Ray Kromer. "This place starts to 
get a lot of foot traffic by Thanksgiving, and it was only a matter of time 
before someone would have been hit by a car." 
</P>
<P>
Betty and Joe Finnell were in on the ground floor of the Dahlia and Shadbush 
decorating boom, making their own displays a little more intricate and 
sophisticated year after year as Joe Finnell, an electrical engineer at 
McDonnell Douglas, picked up more and more electrical know-how. 
</P>
<P>
"When some of our neighbors saw what we were coming up with, they asked us how 
we did it," Betty Finnell recalls. "Joe was more than willing to help them. 
With each year, the idea to decorate became more popular with the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Finnell's influence can be seen, for example, in neighbor Bev Bromley's 
display, which features the snowball thrower that captivated little Johnny 
Sulvain. That was Joe's idea. Bromley's display, at Shadbush Street and 
Dandelion Circle, also features a monkey teeter-totter and a skiing bear that 
looks as though it may fly off the roof. 
</P>
<P>
So far, decoration fever has spread to about 25 homes in the neighborhood. 
Those that don't include mechanical effects make up for it with upholstery 
batting used as snow, gingerbread people with flickering eyes, countless 
snowmen, hundreds of fake Christmas trees, toy soldiers, candy canes, Santas 
and reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine anybody going to so much trouble to decorate," said Elizabeth 
Fontane, 33, of Garden Grove. "I thought my dad used to go all out, but these 
decorations are incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Fontane was seeing the displays for the first time. "My friend told me I'd be 
blown away, and she spent all day trying to talk me into it," she said, gazing 
around her. "I thought it would be the usual lights and stand-up stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, was I wrong!" 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Esperaza, 10, of Santa Ana was particularly fond of the chipmunks that, 
with the help of a strategically placed speaker, sing nonstop Christmas carols 
four hours a day on a stage built by homeowner Ed Ahumada. Chewing a candy cane 
(which she got from the Finnells), Teresa said she hopes everybody gets the 
same feeling she gets when she sees this display: "It makes me feel good," she 
said. "I wish Christmas was tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
There were, however, a few who felt the "lights and stuff" were a bit much. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," shouted Sid Marcy, 22, of Huntington Beach, trying to be heard 
above the chipmunks. "I don't want to sound like a Scrooge or something, but I 
think these displays are . . . it's like Disneyland! I prefer simple lights and 
trees." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Mark McClair drove all the way from San Bernardino with his 
family to get some ideas for their display. The "same old boring lights and 
trees," he said with a laugh, are "exactly what I don't want." 
</P>
<P>
"I heard about these displays from a friend of mine who came last year," said 
McClair while his 8-year-old daughter, Kimberley, tugged at his arm. "I think 
this is great. But I also think this stuff is beyond my know-how." 
</P>
<P>
Even Joe Finnell finds the job to be considerably more than a piece of 
Christmas cake. "He takes a month off from work just to get everything up," his 
wife said. "We save our vacation time for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
The lights shine from 6 to 10 nightly through Dec. 26. Police recommend that 
visitors park at the Fountain Valley Recreation and Cultural Center, 16400 
Brookhurst St.

REDISCOVER THE FUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

We want the funk, give up the funk. 
</P>
<P>
 We need the funk, we gotta have the funk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For those who agree that the funk is imperative, William (Bootsy) Collins is 
out to oblige once more. 
</P>
<P>
As a member of Parliament-Funkadelic during the 1970s, Collins not only helped 
write the above funk-lover's rallying cry (from the hit, "Give Up the Funk 
(Tear the Roof Off the Sucker)"), he also helped embody it in a notably 
flamboyant fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Collins would wear star-shaped glasses and wield a star-shaped bass as he 
joined in P-Funk's carnival of comic-book play-acting and serious grooves. 
Then, still under the guidance of Parliament-Funkadelic leader George Clinton, 
Collins became the mainstay of Bootsy's Rubber Band, one of P-Funk's many 
offshoots. 
</P>
<P>
After several years as arena-levelacts, P-Funk and Bootsy lost some of their 
commercial cachet. At the same time, though, Collins said in a recent interview 
from his home near Cincinnati, he lost some of his enthusiasm for becoming a 
walking cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
"All my fun turned to work," Collins recalled. So he took some time 
</P>
<P>
off during the early '80s, keeping mainly to the 23-acre spread he'd bought 
during P-Funk's peak era. When Collins regained his interest in music-making, 
he decided it should be as a player, not a stage performer. 
</P>
<P>
But now Collins, who started his traveling career as a teen-age bassist backing 
James Brown, is back on the road again for his first extensive touring since 
the P-Funk days. With him are many old cronies from that band including 
guitarists Mike Hampton and Gary Schider, singer Gary (Mudbone) Cooper, and 
fellow James Brown alumni Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley on horns. 
</P>
<P>
"There's new fans out there that definitely have to discover me, or rediscover 
me," said Collins, who released a 1988 comeback album, "What's Bootsy Doin'?" 
and followed it this year with "Jungle Bass." Neither of those recordings had 
the impact of another song that features some of Collins' comic role-playing -- 
the recent Deee-Lite hit, "Groove Is in the Heart." Collins said he and his 
band (plus another P-Funk alumnus, keyboard player Bernie Worrell) will tour 
with Deee-Lite starting next month. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament-Funkadelic's funky sound has been perpetuated by rappers who have 
lifted the band's grooves and riffs for their own recordings -- a development 
that Collins endorses. "The list goes on and on" of fragments of his work that 
turn up on rap recordings. And now, the blend of funk and psychedelic guitar 
rock that P-Funk helped pioneer is also figuring prominently on the charts 
again with the success of such bands as Living Colour, the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers and Faith No More. 
</P>
<P>
"That in itself is inspiring. It lets us know that we were doing something 
right," the amiable Collins said. If Collins and his band can turn the sit-down 
Coach House into a funky cauldron of sweat and shakin' booty, he'll know he 
really has done something right.

Little wonder that so many children discover classical music through 
Tchaikovsky's perennial Christmas favorite, "Nutcracker," either by watching a 
performance of the ballet or by hearing the famous Suite of music drawn from 
it. Right from the start, Tchaikovsky creates a world of sound that children 
can relate to, and that draws them in. 
</P>
<P>
The music can, of course, appeal to adults as well. But it's the kids who may 
be learning for the first time how music can create atmosphere, portray 
character and describe action. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of inventing orchestral sounds for such purposes, lots of composers 
are indebted to Tchaikovsky. Few have scored music better, or even as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Nutcracker's" Overture begins with small, quiet, skipping sounds placed in a 
high range that are easy on young ears; the March, heard soon after, is also 
placed in this range, scored in the same light way and is full of strong, 
gently enveloping rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Tchaikovsky reserves different kinds of sound for different characters. As the 
plot thickens (when the mysterious Drosselmayer gives the Nutcracker doll to 
his favorite goddaughter, Clara, triggering the events of the story), 
Tchaikovsky leaves the light, high sounds behind and begins to draw on the 
lower, more ominous sounds of the bassoons, trombones and tuba. 
</P>
<P>
He brings the two worlds together when the Nutcracker Prince (depicted by 
flutes and clarinets) battles the mice (conveyed by the lower winds and brass). 
Naturally, good wins, and in Act II the Prince takes Clara to the fantasy Land 
of Sweets, as Tchaikovsky spins one of those broad, lovely, romantic themes 
that he never seemed to run out of. 
</P>
<P>
He also begins experimenting with new kinds of sounds for special, ravishing 
effect. Right before the curtain goes up, he has flutes flutter-trill chords, 
creating a sound picture of a cascading fountain (which is what the audience 
actually saw at the ballet's premiere in December, 1892). 
</P>
<P>
He also experiments in the Sugar Plum Fairy's Variation, introducing an 
instrument his Russian audience had never heard before -- the celesta, a metal 
keyboard that creates the delicate tones he deemed appropriate to this 
fantastic figure. 
</P>
<P>
(Tchaikovsky had heard the celesta in Paris and had it sent secretly to St. 
Petersburg for the premiere. "I would prefer it to be shown to nobody," he 
wrote to a friend, "for I am afraid that Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov will get 
wind of it and use its unusual effects sooner than me.") 
</P>
<P>
For those who know only the 20-minute "Nutcracker" Suite, the complete ballet 
can be a joyful discovery. One realizes that Tchaikovsky did not necessarily 
draw the best music from the ballet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nutcrackers' 
</P>

MONKEY BUSINESS: The Santa Ana Zoo isn't happy to have this monkey off its 
back. The zoo has decided to say goodby to two very rare primates -- red-backed 
squirrel monkeys -- and send them to Phoenix. . . . There, the two monkeys will 
join a third friend recently captured, so the Phoenix Zoo can start the 
nation's first captive-breeding program for the monkeys. Santa Ana Zoo

HUNTINGTON BEACH MARKET SUFFERS HEAVY FIRE DAMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
LANDMARK: A FAST-MOVING BLAZE FED BY STRONG WINDS NEARLY GUTTED A 55-YEAR-OLD 
MAIN STREET STORE AND THE APARTMENTS ABOVE IT.

<P>
Standard Market, one of downtown's old landmarks, suffered heavy damage on 
Wednesday afternoon when a fire erupted in the store's kitchen and spread to a 
series of small apartments above, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the 12:28 p.m. blaze was still under investigation late Wednesday, 
but some witnesses and the owner of the blue and gray, two-story building 
speculated that it was sparked by an overturned pot of hot cooking oil. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a lot of hissing and sizzling in the kitchen," said Ramin Hodgatolah 
Taleghani, 28, who lives in a second-floor apartment of the building, located 
at the corner of Main Street and Walnut Avenue, one block from Pacific Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Fire Chief Raymond C. Picard said that six firefighting units 
responded to the blaze within two minutes of its report. He said that although 
firefighters quickly gained control, the fire almost got out of hand because of 
winds estimated to be blowing at almost 20 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"This could have easily gutted it," Picard said. "It was minutes from a total 
loss, if not seconds." 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries in the fire, which closed Main Street between Pacific 
Coast Highway and Olive Avenue for several hours, although there were as many 
as 15 people in the store and the apartments when the blaze broke out, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Picard said that firefighters responding to the two-alarm blaze took extra 
precautions -- remembering the injuries of a firefighter trapped under 
collapsing debris in a fire at the Robert August surf shop four years ago to 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
Fire investigators spent the day probing the ashes for clues. An exact cause of 
the blaze and damage estimates were not expected to be immediately released, 
Fire Department spokeswoman Birgit Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, flames shot as high as 25 feet from the top of the low-slung 
building, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Taleghani said that he and a few other patrons were playing pool in the rear of 
the store when they noticed thick, black smoke pouring from a small kitchen 
area used by residents. They stood there observing it for a second, stunned, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I saw the fire," Taleghani said. "I ran out of the store and tried to 
look for a fire extinguisher." 
</P>
<P>
Dashing to the Chuck Dent Surf Center across the street, Taleghani said that he 
grabbed a fire extinguisher and sprinted back to the rear of the store. 
</P>
<P>
Using the fire extinguisher, he rushed upstairs to his apartment and was able 
to save his dog and his electric guitar. Standing outside the building as 
firefighters poured water on the smoldering roof, Taleghani lamented that his 
clothing and other belongings were ruined. 
</P>
<P>
"My eyes were full of tears; I was choking," he said. "I think I blacked out 
for a second." 
</P>
<P>
"What a disaster," Taleghani added. "I can't even believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the Red Cross had been notified and would provide shelter 
and clothing for the five residents of the upstairs apartments. 
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old store has a colorful history as a gathering place for locals, 
but recently has fallen on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, it was a place to get a cold drink from a soda jerk who manned 
the long, shiny fountain that once lined a wall. 
</P>
<P>
"We had so much fun in that place," said Sy Williams, 76, a retired city 
employee and longtime resident of the beach city. "It was the best place in 
town to go for anything but a good night's sleep." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Standard Market, along with other older buildings, was declared a 
structural hazard by the city largely because it was considered seismically 
unsafe, Fire Chief Raymond C. Picard said. That decision came as the city was 
planning its redevelopment project for Main Street and the Huntington Beach 
Municipal Pier area. 
</P>
<P>
"You essentially have had a condemned building here for five years," Picard 
said. The store, however, has remained open under an agreement with the city 
while redevelopment plans are made. 
</P>
<P>
"It remains to be seen what its (the store's) future is," Picard said, adding 
that it will remain closed while building inspectors determine if it is safe to 
reoccupy. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the building's structural problems, the city backed out of plans to 
reface the store's exterior as it had some of the other buildings on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it is sandwiched between two new developments. On one side is the 
Pierside Pavilion, which includes boutiques, Peppers Golden Bear, offices and a 
soon-to-open condo complex and six-plex movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side is the four-level Main Promenade Parking Structure, which 
will also include retail shops. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown resident Mike Hughes was lunching at Peppers Golden Bear when the fire 
broke out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting down eating lunch, and the next thing I knew, there were no 
waiters waiting on us," he said as he sat on his bicycle in front of Chuck 
Dent's surf shop. "The whole place had cleared out. I thought we were getting a 
free meal." 
</P>
<P>
The store has remained a popular hangout for locals, who regularly gather at 
the small market to pass time playing pool and exchanging gossip. Its Art 
Deco-style facade stands out on the eclectic street that once was the center of 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But ongoing construction, the February oil spill and the closed pier -- long a 
strong tourist attraction -- have contributed to financial troubles this year 
for store owners Mohammed and Abdo Zeidan. They said that they have owned the 
store for 17 years, and only recently have seen the small-town atmosphere of 
Main Street slip away. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole year's been bad," Abdo Zeidan said. "Nobody wants to come here 
anymore, and now this. Maybe God doesn't like us."

HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 'ADOPT' NEEDY KIDS AND HAVE A BALL

When 18-year-old Nadine Alliman peered into the yellow school bus that pulled 
up to the gymnasium at Pacifica High School Wednesday morning, she saw the boy 
of her dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him on the bus and I said, 'I want him,' " Alliman said. "He's so cute. 
I fell in love the moment I saw him." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a star athlete or a youthful hunk that captured Alliman's heart. It 
was a boy named Anthony, a doe-eyed, dark-haired 5-year-old with an infectious 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony was one of 160 children who were adopted for the morning by 261 
Pacifica seniors who participated in the school's annual Adopt-a-Child 
Christmas party, a raucous, fun-filled, two-hour event in which the high school 
students brought gifts and candy to mostly underprivileged and mentally 
handicapped youngsters from two nearby elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
The annual party, which was started seven years ago, has a dual purpose -- 
exposing teen-agers to children less fortunate than themselves and bringing 
holiday joy to those who might otherwise have a not-too-merry Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
On both counts, it was evident Wednesday that the party served its purpose. 
Pacifica seniors eagerly handed out gifts to their "adopted kids," and the 101 
kindergartners from Clinton Elementary School and the 59 children from 
Mendenhall Special Education School rewarded them with smiles and affection in 
return. 
</P>
<P>
"They say some of these kids don't even open their gifts (at the party) until 
Christmas because these may be the only gifts they get, and they want to share 
it with their parents," Alliman said. "Look around you -- you see everyone's 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the numbers of brightly wrapped packages strewn around the gymnasium 
floor, where teens and tykes sat in small circles, the children could have 
opened most of their gifts and still have had plenty left over for Christmas 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
Don Wise, the school's principal, said the entire student body collected 1,004 
gifts for the party. In effect, the event was the spirit of giving gone 
berserk. 
</P>
<P>
"Every (Pacifica) student was told to bring just two gifts," Wise said. "But 
one girl got 27 gifts." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Eastin, 18, a Pacifica senior charged with entertaining a couple of 
Clinton boys named Danny and Tony, said he and two friends ignored Wise's 
two-gift-per-child edict and brought in about 16 gifts each. 
</P>
<P>
"Together, the three of us spent $140," Eastin said. "We don't miss it. I think 
it's for a good cause. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
The Clinton and Mendenhall kids loved it too. Whether they received inexpensive 
coloring books or pricey remote-controlled toy cars, they were all smiles as 
they raced around the gym, shooting baskets, tossing toy footballs, firing toy 
guns or blowing enough bubbles to make even Lawrence Welk jealous. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't start out that way. Although most of the children smiled and 
waved at Santa Claus (portrayed by Pacifica activity director George Terlaak) 
when they first entered the gym, most coyly bowed their heads, stared at the 
floor or shuffled their feet when their teen-age "parents" took them by the 
hand and led them away to open their gifts. When the gifts were handed out, 
many of the children looked at them curiously, as if they couldn't imagine that 
the toys and games were theirs to keep. 
</P>
<P>
"This is kind of upsetting for them when they start," said Lisa Kincaid, a 
teacher who brought nine preschoolers from Mendenhall. "It's just so fun to see 
these high school kids working very hard to relate to these kids, and how they 
react when the kids finally smile or touch their arm." 
</P>
<P>
Kim Nguyen, 18, and Norma Patrinas, 17, were among the many Pacifica seniors 
who initially had trouble getting their adopted child to open up. Monica, 5, a 
Clinton student, quickly opened her gifts, looked at them, and put them back in 
a shopping bag without a word. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not very excited," Nguyen said dejectedly. "She's putting everything in 
the bag like she's ready to go home." 
</P>
<P>
But about an hour later, Monica was eagerly drawing in a coloring book and 
playing with a pair of toy cellular phones. Indeed, the entire gym was, despite 
the chilly weather outside, a warm -- and chaotic -- scene of teens hoisting 
children onto their shoulders, chasing them around the gym and hugging them as 
they prepared to leave. 
</P>
<P>
When the party ended at 11:15 a.m., the hugs and smiles continued as the 
seniors walked or carried the youngsters -- loaded down with stuffed animals, 
dolls and games -- to the buses. The Pacifica students surrounded the vehicles 
and pressed hands and faces against the windows for a final farewell. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our kids get more out of this than those kids do," Wise said.

UCI SEES SAVING BIRD AS NATURAL THING TO DO; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: UNIVERSITY CHANGES ITS CONSTRUCTION PLANS TO ALLOW GNATCATCHER AN 
ENCORE PERFORMANCE.

<P>
In an effort to save rare songbirds, UC Irvine has devised a plan that changes 
the location of a planned chancellor's residence and permanently preserves all 
sensitive habitat on campus, university officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The university had planned to build the University House, estimated to cost $3 
million, atop a bluff that contains coastal sage scrub. The vanishing mix of 
brush and grasses is home to gnatcatchers, a threatened species of tiny gray 
and black birds. 
</P>
<P>
UCI's new plan moves the house 60 feet and its access road 300 feet to the 
north of the rare habitat. Under the revision, the site will be preserved and 
fenced off as part of a 70-acre ecological reserve that will contain all of the 
birds' nesting grounds surrounded by a 100-foot buffer. 
</P>
<P>
"The site now shrinks back from the territory where the gnatcatcher is," said 
Timothy Bradley, an ecology professor who is chairman of the UCI faculty's 
land-use and environment committee. "It is on the periphery of the previous 
site, and it has all the same beautiful aspects while still protecting the 
biological resources." 
</P>
<P>
Biology professors and other faculty members and student groups pressured the 
Administration to change the site because they said the university would be 
setting a poor example if it endangered the rare bird. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty land-use committee voted 7 to 3 to approve the plan, which next 
must be considered by the faculty's executive committee in mid-January. 
Approval is expected, and construction on the house is expected to begin next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he is particularly pleased that the university's revised plan 
protects all coastal sage scrub on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal sage scrub, which lines canyons in coastal areas of Southern 
California, is one of the region's most threatened habitats. It feeds and 
shelters a wide variety of native species. 
</P>
<P>
The gnatcatcher is so rare that it is expected to be added soon to the federal 
list of endangered species. Biologists say its plight is a sign that the entire 
ecosystem in Orange County's coastal canyons has been disrupted and endangered. 
</P>
<P>
"The new plan deals not only with the University House, but all the threats to 
the gnatcatcher," Bradley said. "The university has designed an ecological 
reserve that will defend the gnatcatcher on campus. It will be protected and 
fenced and designated with signs. This is a very big step." 
</P>
<P>
The plan came after Bradley and biology professor Richard E. MacMillen called 
the original site "a biological gem" in a letter to the chancellor and campus 
planners. A rare nest holding four gnatcatcher chicks was seen on the site a 
few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a message from this, it is perhaps that through careful planning, 
one can in fact protect large pieces of this habitat and still complete a great 
deal of development," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Newell Young, a UCI spokeswoman, said the plan is "still considered 
preliminary," but she added that the executive committee probably will approve 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"The big issue was the parking and entryway, which was closest to the nesting 
grounds. The big bone of contention was that it was too close," she said. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental study showed that the original construction would have had 
"unavoidable adverse impacts" on the wrenlike bird that nests in the shrubs and 
grasses. 
</P>
<P>
From 70% to 90% of Orange County's coastal sage scrub already has disappeared. 
Major new housing developments, including the Irvine Coast community south of 
UCI, and the county's plans to build three toll roads could disrupt much of the 
remaining portion. 
</P>
<P>
The original site was atop a hill with a sweeping view of the campus, Newport 
Bay and the ocean. The new site is nearby and has the same basic view, but is 
not as high on the bluff. 
</P>
<P>
The house, funded by private sources, will be the chancellor's official 
residence as well as an entertainment facility and guest quarters. UCI is the 
only university without an on-campus chancellor's house. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan, the university decided not to expand California Avenue 
through the nesting areas as originally planned and will work to avoid impact 
from construction of the San Joaquin Transportation Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UNIVERSITY HOUSE SITE 
</P>
<P>
UCI originally planned to build the chancellor's residence on habitat used by a 
rare bird. Because of protests, the planned site for the house has been moved 
60 feet north and its access road 300 feet north. The university also plans to 
preserve all remaining sensitive habitat on the campus in a 70-acre fenced 
sanctuary.

VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT TO FILL CITY POSTS

<P>
The city is looking for residents to fill up to 23 committee posts that will 
open up next month. 
</P>
<P>
One of those is on the city's design review board. Board Chairman Jeffrey 
Powers was named by the City council this week to the Planning Commission.

SCALED-DOWN PROJECT WINS FINAL APPROVAL 
</P>

<P>
The City Council has let stand its earlier approval of a 17-acre shopping 
center in the Bear Brand community, but gave final approval only after further 
modifying a project that already had 34 conditions attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed center, which will include a seven-screen movie theater and three 
restaurants, has been opposed by some residents as a hulking, noisy intrusion 
into their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time a Planning Commission decision has been appealed to the 
City Council in this city. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 1 Tuesday in favor of the project, which Shea Business 
Properties will develop on the northeast corner of Camino del Avion and Street 
of the Golden Lantern. Thomas W. Wilson cast the dissenting vote and Mayor 
Patricia C. Bates abstained. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, residents opposed the center because it would obstruct ocean views. 
Later objections revolved around the size of the theater, walkways in the 
theater area and the attendant increase in noise and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
In approving the project, the council ordered that the theater be reduced from 
32 to 28 feet in height and that a seventh screen be added while maintaining 
the overall 1,600-seat capacity. The latter provision is intended to reduce the 
number of people arriving and leaving the theater at a given time. 
</P>
<P>
The council also agreed to require that additional pedestrian pathways be 
created near the theater while moving automobile traffic farther away. 
</P>
<P>
During the approval process, the size of the project was shrunk by more than 
5,000 square feet, senior planner Micki Harris said. A proposed service station 
was also deleted. LESLIE EARNEST

CITY SEEKS WAYS TO KEEP LID ON PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Because of a recent fatal stabbing at a rowdy party, the City Council called on 
police and city staff to suggest ways to prevent such parties from getting out 
of control. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action Tuesday came in response to the death of Ty Aaron Stout, 
23, who died of stab wounds on Dec. 8 after a fight broke out at a party in the 
4900 block of Via del Cerro. A second stabbing victim, Steve Nicholas Lindsay, 
17, of Yorba Linda, was treated at a hospital for a wound to his arm. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Richard Velasco, 19, of Anaheim was arrested on suspicion of stabbing 
the two men. Dennis Scott Kidd, 22, of Anaheim was arrested later on suspicion 
of aiding, concealing and harboring the murder suspect. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members had suggested an ordinance similar to one in Los Alamitos, 
which prohibits charging admission to parties in residential areas. But City 
Atty. Leonard Hampel said that ground is already covered by state laws. 
</P>
<P>
Police said hundreds of people showed up at the Via del Cerro party, which had 
been advertised through flyers at several high schools in the area. One 
principal in the district handed over a flyer to the police several days before 
the party, school officials said. But police said they were unable to determine 
much about the party because the flyers gave no exact date, time or place. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult to pin it down when it happens," said Lt. Cliff Trimble, 
adding that even parents can be unaware of a party. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had cases where there have been parents putting suitcases in the car and 
not knowing there was going to be a party." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Kielty, a trustee of the Placentia Unified School District board, said he 
will pursue a policy of expelling students who hand out flyers advertising 
parties where alcohol is to be served. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Liable, a Yorba Linda resident and a member of the city's Traffic 
Commission, said that neighbors should get in the habit of calling authorities 
about such signs as excess cars on the street or high school students taking 
alcoholic beverages into a house. Police can be stationed outside the party to 
make sure it doesn't get out of hand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't wait until someone is knifed or stabbed," Liable said. "You call the 
police when it's building up. . . . Let's not wait until the beer bottles start 
flying." TED JOHNSON

<P>
COUNCIL TO REASSESS ARTS FUNDING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will take another look at a 2-year-old report that recommended 
the city expand its involvement in the performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the council supported Councilman Mark Leyes' request to again take 
up the report that suggested a permanent source of funding for the arts, 
perhaps an entertainment tax, that could pay for projects such as the 
construction of a third theater in the Village Green arts complex. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations were drafted by a community committee during a controversy 
over funding the Grove Shakespeare Festival. The controversy led to the city's 
phasing out of financial support for the festival and the Garden Grove 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
But with the election of Leyes and the retirement of Councilman Raymond T. 
Littrell, who opposed arts funding, the council may now be more open to 
supporting such funding. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's report will be brought to the council for consideration at a 
future date.

MAN KILLED WHEN CAR RUNS STOP SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Huntington Beach man was killed Tuesday afternoon when his car was hit by a 
vehicle that ran a stop sign, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Pettijohn, 57, was heading east on Mesa Drive when his 1986 Honda Accord 
was hit by a car driven by Mary Rita Hassett Chauvin, 47, of Tustin, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Chauvin, traveling south on Santa Ana Avenue in a 1988 Buick Century, was 
reportedly driving 45 to 50 m.p.h. when she failed to stop at the intersection, 
hitting Pettijohn's car and pushing it into another car, Police Lt. Gary 
Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
Pettijohn was taken to College Hospital Costa Mesa, where he died about an hour 
later, coroner's officials said. Chauvin, whose right heel was fractured, was 
taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana and was reported to be in stable 
condition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the third car was not hurt, Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
No citation was issued, pending an investigation, Webster said.

INQUIRY ASKED AFTER MOLESTER HIRES MINORS 
</P>

<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office asked for an investigation 
Wednesday into whether a convicted child molester violated probation by hiring 
minors to sell candy bars. 
</P>
<P>
John Pizzini, 30, of Costa Mesa, who pleaded guilty to four counts of child 
molestation earlier this year, was released from jail in October after serving 
a three-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
He was placed on three years' probation, which required him to register with 
police as a sex offender and stay away from minors. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane Shade said she had been informed that Pizzini was 
hiring children ages 10 and older to go door to door and sell candy for 
Pizzini's Youth Enterprise Program. 
</P>
<P>
Although a former business operated by Pizzini had a different name, it is the 
same type of operation that got him into trouble before, Shade said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've called his probation officer and we're are going to investigate the 
matter," Shade said, adding that she has received calls from parents who 
expressed concern about Pizzini's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Pizzini could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the county probation office, as a matter of policy, declined to 
discuss Pizzini's case. 
</P>
<P>
Pizzini was arrested in July by Costa Mesa police and charged with four 
misdemeanor counts of lewd acts with a child. The victim was a 14-year-old 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
Pizzini, dubbed "the Candy Man" by local law enforcement officials, reportedly 
wanted to marry the girl but was stopped by authorities, who ordered that she 
be sent to a shelter for abused and neglected children. The victim was then 
released into the care of her father, Shade said.

JURY WEIGHING ISSUES IN RARE ZEBRA SKINS CASE; 
</P>
<P>
WILDLIFE: A SAFARI LEADER IS BEING TRIED FOR BRINGING THE HIDES TO THE UNITED 
STATES, WHERE THE SALE OF SUCH PELTS FROM THE THREATENED SPECIES IS ILLEGAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal court jury in Los Angeles was asked to decide Wednesday whether a 
South African safari tour leader illegally imported nine skins from a rare and 
threatened species of zebra and tried to peddle them in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution contends that Wallace Charles Venter, 37, knew it was illegal 
to sell the Hartmann's Mountain Zebra skins in the United States and had 
written a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service saying that the skins 
were not intended for sale. 
</P>
<P>
But in August and September, Venter placed two classified ads in the Orange 
County Register offering to sell zebra hides for up to $1,900, according to 
documents prepared by the prosecution. An anonymous reader called Fish &amp; 
Wildlife to complain, and Venter was arrested in September after he allegedly 
sold one of the skins to an undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
Venter's attorney, Morton H. Boren, said Venter leads safari tours in South 
Africa and came to the United States "to see if he could drum up business." 
Boren said Venter did not sell the skin but was merely using it as collateral 
while he arranged the sale of other, legally imported skins. Venter thought 
that transaction was perfectly legal, Boren said. 
</P>
<P>
"The law is really confused," Boren said. "He honestly believed it was OK for 
him to use one or two of these skins for collateral. . . . If he was going to 
sell these skins illegally, he would just sell them and split." 
</P>
<P>
Venter is charged with importing nine skins for sale, selling one skin, and 
making a false statement to a government official, Boren said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government considers the Hartmann's Mountain Zebra a "threatened" 
species, which means that it is likely to become an endangered species within 
the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the common black-and-white zebra, the Hartmann's zebra is brown and buff 
colored and has an unusual pattern of cross-bar stripes. At last count in 1985, 
there were only 7,000 of the animals left in Southwest Africa and neighboring 
Angola. 
</P>
<P>
Boren said Venter's zebra hides were taken with the approval of South African 
authorities as part of a drought cull. 
</P>
<P>
"The herd was too big for the water supply, so they captured and destroyed 40 
to 60 of them," Boren said. The skins were sold to a tannery, which sold them 
to a friend of Venter's, who asked Venter to bring them to the United States, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And he thought, 'Well, if Americans can buy them there, when I'm in America 
why don't I see about taking orders for them in South Africa, with all the 
(proper) documents,' " Boren explained. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law forbids importing threatened species for commercial activities, 
including their sale, but it does allow tourists to bring the skins home for 
their own personal and non-commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. John S. Wiley Jr. would not comment on the case as the 
jury was deliberating Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But according to the prosecution's memorandum, Venter had begun trying to sell 
the skins even before they were brought to Los Angeles on Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in his safari suit and speaking with a noticeable accent, Venter 
visited a Fish and Wildlife Service office and picked up information about 
wildlife-import regulations, and placed several calls to the department on Aug. 
1, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The first newspaper ad, which began appearing on Aug. 26, said, "African Games 
Skins, zebra, Springbok Etc. $50," followed by a Long Beach-area telephone 
number. The second ad offered "Zebra skins, $1,900," the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
On about Aug. 30, a 27-year-old Yorba Linda man called Venter and asked about 
buying the skins. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a real heavy accent, South African," said Donald K. Augustine, who was 
called to testify at the trial. "We joked about the problems over in South 
Africa. He was a nice man, he really was, considering . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Augustine said that Venter promised to bring the skins to his office in Orange 
for examination. Augustine said he had friends who had brought zebra skins back 
from safaris and had no idea that the skins Venter was selling belonged to a 
threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
"He had to know it was illegal," Augustine said in an interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him, 'Is this legal?' and he said 'Yeah.' I said, 'You've got 
permission?' He said, 'Yeah.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Venter never showed up for the appointment and Augustine dropped the matter 
until federal prosecutors found his telephone number among Venter's papers and 
called him to testify. 
</P>
<P>
When the skins arrived in Los Angeles, a customs inspector thought the shipment 
was unusual and asked for a notarized affidavit from Venter that they were for 
personal and not commercial use, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
Venter did write a letter saying that the skins were purchased by a man named 
Sidowski, and that five would be used to decorate Sidowski's house and the 
other four would be used by Venter as a backdrop for photographs to promote his 
safari business, the prosecution's memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter added, "There is no intention of selling them." 
</P>
<P>
When customs officials opened the crate, they found the zebra skins as well as 
a stuffed Nile crocodile, which is an endangered species that is not permitted 
in this country under any circumstances, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The crocodile was seized, but prosecutors could not locate Sidowski and are not 
sure whether such a person exists, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
The zebra skins were shown to the jury and introduced into evidence. In his 
closing statement, Boren said that the jury should not be swayed by their 
emotions toward killing wildlife, but should focus strictly on the legal issues 
involved. The case is being heard by U.S. District Court Judge William D. 
Keller.

HARRY'S LIFE IS ONE FOR THE BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emile Harry's innermost thoughts have stretched far beyond the limits of the 
football field, where stardom, or waivers, can be a fingertip catch away. 
</P>
<P>
When he attended Fountain Valley High School, Harry caught touchdown passes and 
wrote poetry. 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, he caught touchdown passes, studied political science and worked 
as a computer consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Now a wide receiver with the Kansas City Chiefs, Harry recently completed a 
book titled "Flight Above the Moon." He still catches touchdown passes, only 
not as often as he used to. 
</P>
<P>
"The book's a story of life and death, and it all takes place on an airplane," 
said Harry, who finished it last year and hopes to have it published. 
</P>
<P>
"It's written from the Judeo-Christian perspective. It's about this 
intellectual snob who's in a life-threatening situation on the plane, and he 
learns about life along the way. It's a good introspective look." 
</P>
<P>
Harry wrote the book early in his NFL career, when he was struggling to make it 
as a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all about the trials and tribulations that were going on in my life," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After playing five years in the NFL, Harry can take a step back and take a long 
look at where he has been. And where he's going. 
</P>
<P>
Harry, 27, has played most of his pro career as a reserve, wondering day-to-day 
if his name would be on a locker the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
His best season was in 1989, when he filled in for injured Stephone Paige and 
caught 33 passes for 430 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Harry has similar numbers, catching 32 passes for 403 yards and two touchdowns 
entering Sunday's game at San Diego. The Chiefs (9-5), one game behind the 
Raiders, are trying to win their first AFC West title since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't know how long the Chiefs want to keep me," he said. "Every year 
they say, 'He doesn't have 4.3 (second) speed.' But I've never had 4.3 speed, 
and I've played in this league for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have my own opinion on why I'm here. I believe my talents haven't changed 
much, other than some honing. The bottom line with me is that God is author and 
finisher of what I do." 
</P>
<P>
Harry's NFL career started in 1985, when he was drafted in the fourth round by 
the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
He was coming off a good career at Stanford, where he started three seasons and 
finished with 123 catches for 2,270 yards and 15 touchdowns. He was sidelined 
with injuries for most of his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
But he was back in shape by the time he reported to the Falcons' camp, and he 
impressed the coaches during the exhibition season as a receiver-kick returner. 
Harry was confident he would make the team. 
</P>
<P>
Only four days before the start of the season, the Falcons traded for veteran 
receiver Charlie Brown of the Washington Redskins. Harry, now expendable, was 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a $95,000 summer job," Harry said. 
</P>
<P>
Harry became one of the league's wandering nomads, trying out with the 49ers, 
Chiefs and Redskins during the 1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
He had a good feeling after his tryout with Kansas City. He signed a free-agent 
contract with the Chiefs for 1986. 
</P>
<P>
During the off-season, he returned to Palo Alto, where he was renting an 
apartment, and began training with James Lofton, an all-pro receiver with the 
Green Bay Packers, and Kermit Washington, a former basketball player with the 
Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
"Kermit is the most fit man I have ever known," Harry said. "And James had 
played my position for many many years. I believe when you work with great 
players, you develop a great attitude. I just hung out with them and worked out 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
When the Chiefs broke camp in August, John Mackovic, the coach at the time, 
announced he would carry five receivers. Harry thought he had made the team. 
</P>
<P>
Then Mackovic revised his plans just before the season, and Harry was the last 
player cut. 
</P>
<P>
He kept in shape. He still had hopes of playing. 
</P>
<P>
He got his chance a month into the season, when Chief receiver Anthony Hancock 
injured his knee and underwent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Harry filled Hancock's roster spot and has been with the Chiefs since. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley Coach Mike Milner said the NFL was a "tough adjustment" for 
Harry. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing in the NFL has a lot to do with ability, but also being in the right 
spot at right time," Milner said. "When you think about the talented players 
walking on streets right now, there are a lot of them who could be playing in 
the NFL under the right situation. You have to find your niche." 
</P>
<P>
Harry found his with the Chiefs. He finished the 1986 season with nine catches 
for 211 yards and a touchdown. After missing 1987 with a shoulder injury, Harry 
has averaged 30 catches the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Harry's hopes of NFL stardom started in Fountain Valley, where he played 
football with his friends as a kid. 
</P>
<P>
He was the fourth of Alvin and Nilene Harry's seven children. He and his 
younger brother, Carl, now a wide receiver with the Redskins' developmental 
team, were the athletes in the family. 
</P>
<P>
"Emile's one of the best athletes who ever came through here," said Milner, who 
has been at Fountain Valley for 19 years. r"If Emile would have picked up a 
tennis racket or a golf club, he could have done anything with it." 
</P>
<P>
Harry split time at quarterback and wide receiver as a junior. He was moved to 
wide receiver full-time as a senior when Matt Stevens took over at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Emile would have had a great future at quarterback if he had stayed 
there," Milner said. "He had a great arm." 
</P>
<P>
And Harry wanted to stay at quarterback, but Milner convinced him his future 
was even brighter at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"Milner means so much to me," Harry said. "He was the guy I listened to as a 
youth. So many guys on that team had talent but didn't listen to what Milner 
told them." 
</P>
<P>
Harry was more effective as a receiver than a passer. As a senior, he had 52 
catches for 1,141 yards and 12 touchdowns. He was named the Southern Section 
Big Five Conference player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"As a receiver, he could do anything," Milner said. "He had courage and could 
run the crossing routes over the middle. He made the acrobatic catches. He has 
tremendous body control." 
</P>
<P>
Harry remembers high school well. He's looking forward to his 10-year class 
reunion and hopes it won't conflict with the football season. 
</P>
<P>
"When I played, high school football was pure, unadulterated," he said. "The 
guys I played with will always have a place in my heart." 
</P>
<P>
Life isn't as carefree as it was when he was 17. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Sonia, bought a home in Kansas City. Their son, Judah-Michael, 
11 months, keeps them busy. There are responsibilities, bills to pay. 
</P>
<P>
And Harry knows that one day, playing football will no longer be a part of 
those responsibilities. He's ready. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm done playing, I want to write," he said. "That's one of my favorite 
things to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

IT'S ANYBODY'S TITLE IN THE OLYMPIC LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Confusion reigns in Olympic League boys' basketball. Ask any coach for a 
favorite to win the league, and you'll get one of four answers: Brethren 
Christian, Whittier Christian, Orange Lutheran or Valley Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Brethren has size and depth. Valley Christian has several key players back from 
last season's league champion. Whittier Christian features one of the Olympic's 
best players in Ruben Oronoz and Orange Lutheran has two starters back. 
</P>
<P>
"The league title will be up for grabs this season," Orange Lutheran Coach Matt 
Hansen said. "At least four or five teams could challenge for the top spot." 
</P>
<P>
St. Margaret's shouldn't have much trouble repeating as the Academy League 
champion. The Tartans return center Ryan Westendorf, who led Orange County in 
rebounding last season with a 19.6 average. 
</P>
<P>
After playing a free-lance schedule last season, Calvary Chapel joins the 
Arrowhead League, in which Southern California Christian is the defending 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
A closer look at the county's small schools: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BRETHREN CHRISTIAN 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Richard Thomas (seventh year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 20-10, 8-6 in Olympic League. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Five. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Frank Brady (G, 5-10, Sr.); Chris Fry (C, 7-0, Jr.); Chiron Hart 
(F, 6-3, Jr.); Tim Nichol (F, 6-3, Sr.); Brandon Stott (G, 6-1, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Jermaine Forge (G, 6-0, Sr.); Ernest Henderson (G, 5-9, Sr.); 
Aaron Neilsen (F, 6-3, Sr.); Tim Osborn (F, 6-2, Jr.); Scott Thomas (F, 6-2, 
Soph.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The Warriors return five of their top eight players, and Thomas has 
promoted several players from last season's league-champion junior varsity. The 
Warriors have two strong outside shooters in Stott and Hart, who are both 
returning starters. But lack of an inside scorer and a playmaker could keep the 
Warriors from unseating defending champion Valley Christian. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CALVARY CHAPEL 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Steve Middleton (second year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 7-13 free-lance schedule (First year in Arrowhead League). 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Six. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Three. Top returners: Brian Arrowood (G, 6-0, Jr.); Jason 
Vanderburg (C, 6-3, Soph.); Jon Winterkorn (F, 6-0, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Darrell Coloma (G, 5-11, Soph.); Chase Lubbock (G, 5-11, Soph.); 
John O'Brien (F, 6-4, Jr.); Allen Tate (G, 5-10, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Middleton is hoping for help from three transfers: O'Brien, who 
averaged 19 points a game last season at Newport Christian; Tate, who 
transferred from Saddleback after sitting out last year, and Lubbock, who 
played on the freshman team last year at Garden Grove. Calvary, in its third 
year of existence, joins the Arrowhead League this season after struggling with 
an all-underclassmen lineup last season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CAPISTRANO VALLEY CHRISTIAN 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Art Jenkins (first year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 7-23, 2-12 in Olympic League. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: One. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: One. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Nathan Owen (F, 6-3, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Jeff Bishop (G, 6-0, Sr.); Jeremiah Bodnar (G, 6-0, Sr.); Chuck 
Carlsen (C, 6-3, Soph.); Mark Chapman (F, 6-1, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Jenkins has no choice but to rely on Owen and the four newcomers. 
That's his entire team. With only five varsity players and five on the junior 
varsity, Jenkins expects to have many problems, especially in league. "I don't 
see any strengths at this time," Jenkins said. "Our weaknesses could be stated 
as obvious." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ORANGE LUTHERAN 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Matt Hansen (first year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 16-11, 9-5 in Olympic League. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Brian Bedord (C, 6-3, Sr.); Matt Bode (G, 6-1, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Cory Fleming (G, 5-10, Jr.); Lenny Gavin (G, 5-11, Jr.); Chad 
Mihr (F, 6-3, Jr.); Chad Reed (F, 6-4, Soph.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Hansen begins his first year as head coach, replacing Jerry Simmons, 
who retired. He has two solid returners to work with in Bode and Bedord. Bode 
averaged eight points and four assists last season and Bedord averaged 10 
points and seven rebounds. Hansen predicted a fourth-place finish for the 
Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ST. MARGARET'S 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Rick Bauer (third year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 21-6, 10-0 in Academy League. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Mike Baksic (G, 5-10, Sr.); Geoff Hanzlik (F, 6-3, Jr.); Ravi 
Mruthyunjaya (G, 5-6, Soph.); Ryan Westendorf (C, 6-7, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Lupe Rodriguez (G, 5-7, Fr.); Aaron Wright (C, 6-6, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Westendorf is the key. He averaged 26.2 points and led the county in 
rebounding last season with a 19.6 average. He was the league's most valuable 
player and led the Tartans to the Southern Section small school final, where 
they lost to Ribet Academy, 68-60. The only other returning starter is 
Mruthyunjaya, the point guard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHRISTIAN 
</P>
<P>
Coach: John Diebold (first year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 13-8, 10-0 in Arrowhead League. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Three. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Ben Carlson (F, 6-4, Sr.); Toby Dembowski (F, 6-4, Sr.); Chris 
Ludlow (G, 6-3, Sr.); Scott Williams (G, 6-3, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Paul Lange (F, 6-4, Sr.); Mike Hatcher (C, 6-6, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Diebold, who coached Newport Christian until the school folded this 
year, begins his first season at Southern California Christian. He compared his 
team with the Newport Christian squad he coached to the 1989 Southern Section 
finals. "That team went 22-3," he said. "We have the capability to do that with 
this team." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHITTIER CHRISTIAN 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bob Brown (third year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 14-12, 9-5 in Olympic League. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: One. 
</P>
<P>
Top returners: Ruben Oronoz (F, 6-5, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Mark Berokoff (F, 6-2, Jr.); Jacob Cuccia (G, 5-10, Soph.); 
Kerry Houser (F, 6-2, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Whittier Christian features one of the most consistent players in the 
league in Oronoz. The Heralds, who won the Southern Section 2-AA title two 
years ago, also have one of the quickest teams in the league, Brown said. But 
lack of a center and inexperience could keep them from challenging for the 
league title.

Good players are said to put on their "game face" for an important opponent, 
but for Wayne Carlander, Ocean View's All-American forward, it was the legs. 
</P>
<P>
"When his legs are shaking, and he's bouncing up and down during warm-ups -- 
look out," Ocean View Coach Jim Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris detected the vital signs before Ocean View, Orange County's top-ranked 
team, played Long Beach Poly, the top team in the Southern Section poll, in the 
San Dimas tournament. 
</P>
<P>
He was right. Carlander had 34 points, 20 rebounds and six assists in a 67-55 
victory. Ocean View went on to win the tournament championship. 
</P>
<P>
"No one in high school can guard him one-on-one," Poly Coach Ron Palmer said. 
"He can control a game." 
</P>
<P>
As you might expect, Harris went a bit further in his praise: "Wayne is the 
best player in the country -- passing, shooting, dribbling, you name it. 
Remember, he did all this tonight against the best." 
</P>
<P>
Actually it was an average night for Carlander: He averaged 33 points and 20 
rebounds entering the game. 
</P>
<P>
Carlander later led USC to a Pacific 10 championship in 1985 and played in 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 YEARS AGO 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda Coach Gene Lloyd knows talent, even if it's in a 9-year old. 
</P>
<P>
He was watching his son play in an age-group recreation league game and noticed 
another player dominating. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid was the same age as my son, but he was taller and more coordinated 
than anyone else on the floor. Even then I knew he was going to be something 
special." 
</P>
<P>
He was. Kevin Walker grew to be 6-10 and accepted a scholarship to play for 
UCLA before his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
Walker averaged 26 points and 11 rebounds as a Brea-Olinda senior. The Wildcats 
went 23-5 in 1985-86 and were eliminated in the second round of the Southern 
Section 3-A Division playoffs by eventual champion Rolling Hills, 60-56. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 YEAR AGO 
</P>
<P>
I'm Here for the Pizza, Dude: Although the Ocean View Tournament of Champions 
had a near-capacity crowd for the final between Mater Dei and Long Beach Poly, 
most of the conversation was on the extras -- such as Ocean View cheerleaders 
and boosters working as waitresses and serving pizza to those in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to give the tournament an ambience with banners, flags, two canopy 
entrances and spotlights on the gymnasium," said Roy Englebrecht, the 
tournament's executive director. "We wanted to give the fans a steak and the 
sizzle. I didn't want this to be just another high school tournament in just 
another high school gym." 
</P>
<P>
Poly defeated Mater Dei, 54-47. And the pizza was good.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK;

<P>
FRESHMAN WILL ADD MATURITY . . . IN 1993 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You see him on the bench -- tall, slender Dan Augulis, a freshman from Kansas 
who played on an undefeated state championship team last season. 
</P>
<P>
He practices like the other UC Irvine players, almost every afternoon and even 
some mornings as early as six o'clock. 
</P>
<P>
He runs when they run and sweats when they sweat. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference is that Augulis almost certainly will not get into a game 
this season, or next season or the season after that. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-10, 200-pound 18-year-old, Augulis will redshirt this season. Then, 
for the next two seasons, he will be on a two-year mission for the Mormon 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
"When you grow up in the Mormon Church with all its beliefs, you expect that 
you will go out and teach," said Augulis, who was born in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
When he returns in 1993 to finally play his freshman season, he will be 21 and 
probably won't know more than three players on the team; Gabe Higa, Khari 
Johnson and Rick Swanwick, all freshmen, will be seniors then. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot of kidding," Augulis said. "They say I'll be part of the first 
father-son combination." 
</P>
<P>
Augulis' playing days seem a long way off to Coach Bill Mulligan, who is 
concerned with the here and now of improving on last season's record of 5-23. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's going to be a good player some day," Mulligan said. "I like him a 
lot, and he gets along with everyone. People said he was just a post player, 
but he can shoot outside. He's better than some people told me. But I can't 
worry about what he's going to do right now." Other schools were interested in 
Augulis, whose Shawnee Mission High School team went 24-0 last season while 
winning the Kansas 6-A (large schools) state championship. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, Augulis visited Brigham Young. The school didn't maintain its 
interest, but the visit might have influenced other schools. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'Oh, a Mormon kid took a trip to BYU,' " he said. "Then they back 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after his 19th birthday Aug. 9, Augulis will complete the paperwork for 
his mission and go to Provo, Utah, for training. He might be placed in the 
United States, or he might be sent abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that would be kind of fun," he said, imagining a crash course in 
German for a mission in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
During his mission, he will play basketball when he can, but it will not be his 
focus. He will have one day a week off, but that will also be laundry and 
grocery day. Basketball is down on the list. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll be OK," Augulis said. "I'll play a little bit, and I'll work 
really hard when I get back. When you've been playing all your life, I don't 
know if you lose that much." 
</P>
<P>
Augulis is the type of young player who often needs extra time to grow into his 
body, and he says the break could help his basketball career. 
</P>
<P>
"I get two years to put on the weight," he said. "I'm only 18. I think it could 
be an advantage for me to come back physically and mentally more mature." 
</P>
<P>
More mature, definitely. 
</P>
<P>
And then what? Augulis says he is considering a career in medicine. Four more 
years of school, an internship and residency . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be really old when I got out of that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Add Augulis: Augulis was placed on the traveling roster for the trip to play 
Maryland last week, which included a bus tour of Washington, D.C., and a look 
around the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Augulis wasn't going to play, but Irvine took him along for no other reason 
than to let him enjoy the sights. 
</P>
<P>
Augulis smiled at the thought. 
</P>
<P>
"Benevolent coaches, I guess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: Three for 13. Irvine missed 10 free throws in its 87-73 loss 
to San Diego State Saturday, shooting 23%. Dylan Rigdon made two free throws 
for a 2-0 lead, and then the Anteaters made only one of their next 11. Rigdon, 
the only Irvine player to make any free throws, went three for six. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine shot a higher percentage from three-point range, which is 19 feet 9 
inches from the goal, than from the line, 15 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"Five yards away," Mulligan said Monday, shaking his head, and illustrating how 
short the distance is. "That's half a first down." 
</P>
<P>
The women's team, which has a 2-5 record, continues to be a poor free-throw 
shooting team, now making 52% from the line. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Lizarraga, who has made 15 of 21 (71%) is the only player with a good 
percentage and one of only three making at least 60%. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's largest crowd for a men's game in the Bren Center in three dates is a 
paltry 2,571 against Bradley, to the exasperation of Mulligan. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be here for (Nevada Las) Vegas," Mulligan said. "Sure, they'll be here 
for Vegas. It's discouraging to our players. 
</P>
<P>
"If I sound bitter, it's only because I am." 
</P>
<P>
Add attendance: If the crowd seems larger for Irvine's game against California 
Saturday, chalk it up to holiday goodwill -- Irvine's goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
The school is giving away up to 1,500 seats to charitable groups, including the 
Boys and Girls Clubs of Irvine and Newport Harbor and the Fullerton office of 
National Junior Basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Last add attendance: A bonus to the Irvine faithful, however few they might be. 
The first 1,000 fans Saturday will receive free Anteater-nose souvenirs.

STRAPPED DISTRIBUTED LOGIC SELLS ITS SERVICE OPERATIONS 
</P>

<P>
Under pressure from its lenders, financially troubled Distributed Logic Corp. 
said Wednesday that it has sold its computer service operations in the United 
States to Santa Ana-based Novadyne for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
The cash-hungry company also sold its computer service operations in the United 
Kingdom, to British computer firm Sorbus Ltd. The purchase price was not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Distributed Logic also said it expects to report a loss from operations for its 
fourth quarter and fiscal year ended Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The service business "has been distracting and the company has been under cash 
pressure," said Thomas R. Anderson, chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim firm supplies data storage and communications equipment, primarily 
for minicomputers manufactured by Digital Equipment Corp. The minicomputer 
market has been in a slump in recent years, caught in a squeeze between 
low-cost mainframe computers and increasingly powerful personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
Distributed Logic's competitors include two Orange County firms -- Emulex Corp. 
in Costa Mesa and Micro Technology Inc. in Anaheim -- and Digital Equipment 
itself, which has been slashing prices on peripheral products that boost the 
performance of its computers. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months ended July 31, Distributed Logic lost $2.2 million on 
revenue of $33.4 million, contrasted with earnings of $34,315 on revenue of 
$37.9 million for the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
The company, in its quarterly statement for the period ending July 31, 
disclosed that the losses had drained the company's cash and that it was in 
danger of defaulting on its loan agreements if the losses continued. During 
1990, the statement said, the company has cut its work force and renegotiated 
its long-term debt. 
</P>
<P>
John Wilson, Distributed Logic's president, confirmed the job cuts Wednesday 
but declined to say how many people have been laid off in 1990. The company 
currently employs 190 people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Dwight, a spokeswoman for Novadyne, said the computer service company is 
"already in the DEC market, so this alliance is good for us." Novadyne was 
known as McDonnell Douglas Field Systems Co., a unit of McDonnell Douglas 
Corp., until a management-led buyout earlier this year.

TAKEOVER OFFER SPURNED BY DICEON ELECTRONICS

Diceon Electronics Inc. on Wednesday spurned a $27.2-million hostile bid from 
Calvary Partners LP in San Diego, saying the offer was too low and didn't 
reflect Diceon's value in the market. 
</P>
<P>
Diceon's board of directors, making its first response to Calvary's 3-week-old 
offer, also called the bid "highly conditional" and questioned the San Diego's 
firm's ability to finance the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
"The board does not believe that the offer price reflects the intrinsic value 
of Diceon today or the values that we believe our restructuring and strategic 
plan will, if successful, deliver in the future," said Peter S. Jonas, vice 
chairman and executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Calvary noted that its cash offer of $5.25 a share for Diceon's 
5.1 million common shares outstanding is more than double the price that Diceon 
stock was trading at before the offer was announced. 
</P>
<P>
"We question the success of Diceon's 'business strategy' to the extent the 
company incurred a net loss of $2.3 million in fiscal 1989, and another loss of 
$10.2 million in fiscal 1990," the Calvary statement said. "How has Diceon's 
business strategy enhanced shareholder value in a stock that traded at $44.50 
three years ago and has since fallen as low as $1.75 a share prior to the 
Calvary offer?" 
</P>
<P>
James Arabia, Calvary's president and a former Laguna Niguel securities broker, 
said it has no plans to change its offer and will proceed with its plans to 
nominate an alternative slate of directors at the company's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Diceon is a manufacturer of sophisticated circuit boards used in the computer 
and telecommunications industries. 
</P>
<P>
The company began a restructuring program in September, writing off $5 million 
in assets and laying off 225 of its 1,500 employees. The Irvine firm has also 
made changes in its manufacturing plants to speed production of higher-volume 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Diceon said it obtained an opinion from the New York-based investment firm 
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. that the Calvary offer was insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be interesting to see how this unfolds," said Gerald Fleming, analyst 
at Fahnestock &amp; Co., a New York securities firm. "We're telling our clients 
on a preliminary basis to tender their stock, provided Calvary has its 
financing." 
</P>
<P>
Fleming said Diceon's restructuring has made the firm more competitive in the 
circuit board industry, where an inventory glut has caused prices to plummet. 
Although Diceon said the offer was low, Fleming said Calvary has drawn 
attention to Diceon's stockpile of $25 million in cash and the possibility that 
money could be used to finance an acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Calvary has sued Diceon in Delaware court, seeking to change the Irvine firm's 
bylaws to make it easier for the San Diego company to gain seats on Diceon's 
board. Diceon has countersued, seeking to block the bylaw changes.

FASHION: CHILDREN'S RETAILERS TRADITIONALLY FARE BETTER THAN MOST IN TOUGH 
TIMES, BECAUSE PARENTS HESITATE TO SCRIMP ON THEIR KIDS.

DANA POINT

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The models were a little shy at first. Some had to be coaxed from behind the 
curtain. 
</P>
<P>
They wandered on stage at the Ritz-Carlton to show off $120 Ann Savoy dresses, 
$105 Katydid denim skirt and jacket combination and $38 Bami swimsuit, complete 
with water wings. 
</P>
<P>
In the world of high fashion, Calvin Klein and Ann Taylor might be better-known 
names. But not for this crowd. The elegantly dressed diners seemed intrigued as 
they slurped hot chocolate from teacups and munched cookies served on silver 
trays. After all, most of them -- and all of the models -- were children. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly fashion show -- organized by Anne Weiler, owner of a Laguna Beach 
children's clothing store -- is a warm-up act for a weekly puppet show at the 
Dana Point resort hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Children's fashions have become big business in Orange County and elsewhere. 
Some major retailers -- such as Laura Ashley, The Gap and Benetton -- have 
started separate children's lines. And other individual, high-end retail stores 
have sprung up to fill the demand for handmade dresses and baggy, pleated pants 
for fashion-conscious 9-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Most merchants catering to the children's market have been caught by the same 
economic slowdown that is spoiling other retailers' profits this Christmas 
season. But analysts say children's retailers traditionally fare better than 
most in tough times, because parents often hesitate to scrimp when it comes to 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents always have money for their kids," said Peggy Zamberlan, general 
manager of Bernans at South Coast Plaza, an upscale fashion store for children 
and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
That's because people who buy gifts for children are just as likely to buy with 
their hearts as with their heads. "Any time you can connect a retail purchase 
to something that is emotional, people are going to spend a lot more money than 
they normally would for it," said Tony Cherbak, a retail consultant for the 
accounting firm of Deloitte &amp; Touche in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Sales figures appear to bear out the phenomenon. Sales of women's wear have 
dropped 2% in the past four years, while sales of clothing for pre-teen girls 
are up 9%, according to Kurt Salmon Associates, a New York consulting firm. And 
sales of apparel for young children of both sexes increased 25% last year, 
while there was just a 2% growth for the overall economy, according to a recent 
article in Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
A generation ago, few middle-class parents would have thought of paying top 
dollar for designer clothes that children will outgrow in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
In Christmases past, a little girl might have gasped in delight at the sight of 
a ruffled skirt and matching blouse from Sears, Roebuck and Co. But in the 
designer-frenzied '90s, it might take a hand-embroidered appliqued dress from 
Dragonfly to gain the same reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Today, more families have two working parents and more money to spend on 
children. And Orange County is more affluent than it used to be, particularly 
the South County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very lucrative market, especially here in Orange County," said Cherbak 
of Deloitte &amp; Touche. "People in Orange County are not the types to (buy) 
used clothing for their kids. They are yuppie types. So for these specialty 
children's shops . . . this is the market." 
</P>
<P>
Some independent children's wear merchants have learned the value of building a 
loyal clientele through special promotions. Besides the weekly fashion show, 
Anne Weiler holds such events as "clown days" and "princess beauty days," where 
little girls can have their nails done and hair coiffed. 
</P>
<P>
Weiler's store, Kids Kloset/Kids Klub, sells such merchandise as a $350 denim 
jacket embroidered with a cityscape that lights up with the help of a hidden 
nine-volt battery. 
</P>
<P>
Bernans occasionally serenades shoppers with child violinists from a nearby 
music school. 
</P>
<P>
The store offers clothing staples for as little as $10 but also sells $300 
hand-sewn dresses for girls and $66 Cavaricei pants for boys, says Zamberlan, 
the store manager. 
</P>
<P>
Zamberlan said her store's business seems to be getting stronger. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the birthrate is up. Have you ever walked into this mall on a 
Saturday?" she asked. "We call it the Stroller Brigade." 
</P>
<P>
Even if it held steady or dropped, children's clothiers always have an ace in 
the hole: Children constantly outgrow their wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
"Every month they are out of things," said Becky Blake, owner of the Y Grow Up 
stores at MainPlace/Santa Ana and malls in Cerritos and Montebello. "For the 
double-income families, they want more quality. They are looking for something 
that's different too."

BE A RESPONSIBLE PARTY HOST 
</P>

<P>

Driving, Consolidated Beverage Distributors.

<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout the holidays, many Orange County law enforcement agencies will be 
setting up sobriety checkpoints to keep impaired drivers off the road. The 
checkpoints save lives by reducing the number of alcohol-related accidents, but 
a drunk-driving arrest would put a damper on anyone's holiday spirits. 
</P>
<P>
The county chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving offers several suggestions 
for party hosts on how to keep their guests, and the roadways, safe during the 
holidays: 
</P>
<P>
* Don't push drinks on guests or be too quick to fill an empty glass. Most 
people can pace themselves well if they are not pushed into drinking faster. 
</P>
<P>
* Always serve food with alcohol. High-protein food that is low in salt is best 
for slowing alcohol absorption and controlling thirst. Try shellfish, 
meatballs, chicken tidbits and vegetables with dips made from beans, tofu, 
yogurt or cheese. Avoid salty snacks such as chips, commercial dips, smoked 
fish and cheese spreads. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid an open bar. If you cannot serve your guests personally, hire someone 
to do it; and be sure that the alcohol is measured, not freely poured. If 
possible, place the bar in an out-of-the-way place to discourage overdrinking. 
Never serve double drinks. 
</P>
<P>
* Feature juice instead of alcohol. At the bar, put the focus on large glass 
pitchers of fresh fruit and vegetable juices and other nonalcoholic drinks. If 
you have a punch, make it without alcohol. This will encourage guests to drink 
the nonalcoholic beverages. When taking drink orders, highlight these 
alternatives to alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
* Limit cocktail time to half an hour. Most people finish a drink in 15 to 20 
minutes. Thus, a long pre-dinner session can result in tipsy guests whose 
enjoyment of the meal is diminished, especially if they also drink wine at the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
* Serve dinner promptly. Do proper advance planning to ensure that dinner is 
served on time. A delay of even 20 minutes encourages guests to have another 
round of drinks. 
</P>
<P>
* Close the bar after cocktail hour and put all the alcoholic beverages away. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't invite problems. Never invite people who habitually drink too much. If 
someone surprises you by going overboard, make a point of not inviting them 
back. Just as a restaurant or bar can refuse service, so should a host or 
hostess limit guests to those who behave responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't fall into the nightcap trap. Instead of heavy liqueurs after dessert 
and coffee, serve sparking mineral water. This allows guests time to relax and 
and allow their bodies to metabolize the alcohol they have consumed before they 
drive home. Schedule an activity after dinner such as dancing or a game. 
</P>
<P>
* Never serve a guest who appears intoxicated. Offer them food to slow their 
absorption rate. Coffee will not sober a drunk. See to it that they do not 
drive. Offer to drive them yourself, call a cab or suggest that they sleep 
overnight at your home. 
</P>
<P>
According to Janet Cater, director of Orange County MADD, companies holding 
holiday parties that employees are required to attend are liable for any damage 
or loss of life caused by a worker driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies have also been successfully sued for workman's compensation when an 
employee was injured while driving home drunk from a party," she said. 
</P>
<P>
If you are holding your party at a restaurant or bar, make sure your guests get 
home safely yourself or ask the bartender to call the Taxi Time ride program. 
Most major restaurants and bars in Orange County are participating in the 
program, which will give your guest a ride home, courtesy of the California 
Beer and Wine Wholesalers Assn. Taxi Time operates from Dec. 21 to New Year's 
Day. Local beverage wholesalers are distributing information on Taxi Time to 
their customers this week. JANICE L. JONESSource: Orange County Chapter of

In 1987, Karen Wilson Turnbull wrote and illustrated "The Cottages and Castles 
of Laguna," a large-format paperback book featuring 80 pen-and-ink drawings of 
Laguna's melange of architectural styles. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach artist-historian followed that up with "The Rustic Charm of 
Old Orange County," a 1988 book of drawings and descriptions of Orange County's 
remaining "old buildings and places." 
</P>
<P>
And now Turnbull is out with "A Place Called Home: Orange's Architectural 
Legacy," co-authored by Orange historian Phil Brigandi. 
</P>
<P>
Like her previous two paperback books, the new one was published by Turnbull 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
"So I guess," she says with a laugh, "I'm sort of a cottage industry now." 
</P>
<P>
"A Place Called Home" features 70 detailed pen-and-ink drawings of houses and 
other structures built between 1874 and World War II. (Included are three 
commercial buildings and two churches.) The architectural styles include 
everything from Victorian and Mediterranean to Craftsman and Italianate. The 
book's text, written by Brigandi, provides a brief history of each structure. 
</P>
<P>
When Turnbull was casting about for her next book project two years ago, Orange 
seemed the most logical choice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only city left in Orange County, besides San Juan Capistrano, that 
has a historic district where the old houses haven't been bulldozed," said 
Turnbull, 40. 
</P>
<P>
"A Place Called Home," Turnbull said, "is very much a celebration of Orange's 
old architecture." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Laguna, where her book was intended to make people aware of the 
city's historic architecture, she said, "In Orange, the awareness is there." 
Despite that appreciation of the city's past, she added, "nothing had ever been 
done before on the homes. We just thought it really needed to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Turnbull contacted Brigandi, who has written three Orange history books, in 
early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I had thought of doing a book on the downtown business buildings, but never on 
the houses," said Brigandi, 31, who has since moved from Orange to Hemet where 
he serves as museum curator for the Ramona Pageant Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Brigandi quickly agreed to collaborate. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a good year-and-a-half-long project," he said, adding: "It was 
basically done on a handshake the way these things should be." 
</P>
<P>
Turnbull and Brigandi together selected the houses and buildings featured in 
the book and then, while Brigandi began researching the history of each house, 
Turnbull began drawing. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-generation Lagunan, who lives in a rented, 63-year-old beach house 
above Paradise Cove, worked from enlarged black and white photographs that she 
took of each house. Each drawing took her several days because, the mother of 
two said, "I can only work late in the evening when the children are asleep." 
</P>
<P>
Brigandi said he and Turnbull never intended "A Place Called Home" to be a 
chronicle of the "top" 70 historic houses in Orange. Instead, he said, their 
goal was "to make people aware of the historical richness that surrounds them." 
</P>
<P>
So instead of just focusing on houses in the city's historic downtown district, 
they took a much broader sweep: They included houses in one-time separate 
residential areas such as Olive, El Modena, McPherson and West Orange, which 
have since been swallowed up by the City of Orange. They also put in a street 
map showing the locations of the houses featured in the book. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest home is "the Shaffer House" at 221 N. Orange St. Built in 1874, it 
is also the oldest surviving building in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been totally added onto and changed over the years," Brigandi said. "But 
I like to joke that it has additions on it that are older than many of the 
historic houses in town." 
</P>
<P>
Brigandi said they also included a vintage 1880 drawing of the Shaffer House, 
"so you can see what it looked like when it was intact." 
</P>
<P>
"A Place Called Home" ($15) is available at Watson Drug in Orange's downtown 
plaza, 116 E. Chapman Ave. It also can be purchased by writing to Phil 
Brigandi, 675 S. San Jacinto, No. 2, Hemet, Calif. 92343. (Include an 
additional $1.50 for postage and handling.) 
</P>
<P>
Bilingual Cookbook: Sarah Bruck of Newport Beach and Norma Soleno-DeVaney of 
Orange have co-authored what they believe is the first comprehensive bilingual 
(Spanish-English) cookbook. 
</P>
<P>
The book, "Cooking Maid Easy," is designed to help bridge the communication gap 
in the kitchen that affects women who rely on Spanish-speaking housekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the three-ring-binder cookbook are 100 recipes of "classic family 
fare," ranging from Oven Fried Chicken (Pollo Frito al Horno) to Apple Pie 
(Pastel de Manzana). 
</P>
<P>
Says Soleno-DeVaney, a certified public accountant who was born in Baja 
California: "No recipe has more than six steps, all dishes appeal to both 
adults and children, and ingredients can easily be found in the cupboard or 
local supermarket." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the book came from what she and Bruck say is a growing need for 
bilingual domestic instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we both speak fluent Spanish, many of our friends have relied on us to 
provide Spanish translations for housekeeping tasks," says Bruck, an attorney. 
"And while bilingual literature for housekeeping tasks is available, two 
extremely neglected areas for bilingual communications are the kitchen and the 
nursery." 
</P>
<P>
"Cooking Maid Easy" ($30) is available in fine gift and cookware stores and by 
mail order. For more information, call (714) 644-2404.

Though Hanukkah gift giving has ended, there remains just a little more than a 
weekend to get in last-minute Christmas shopping. 
</P>
<P>
To help mothers and fathers with gift selection, Hot Topics asks, "What is the 
most popular gift -- within economic reality -- parents can give their 
teen-agers?" 
</P>
<P>
"Freedom and trust; to respect their thoughts and let them go places with 
friends; just basically respecting their judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Heather Reed, 14, freshman, Los Alamitos

better things for you."

</P>

HIGH LIFE: A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
SOME STUDENTS SEE THE HOLIDAY AS JOB OPPORTUNITY

For most high school students, winter vacation is a time for parties, 
merriment, lazy mornings and, most important, no school. But some students 
decide to make the most of their time off by making money through seasonal 
employment at the Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
This season, more than 500 high school students from all over Orange County are 
employed by the mall's 160 stores. Some of the teen-agers are temporary 
employees, working jobs only available this busy time of the year. Others with 
regular jobs at the mall simply work more days or longer hours. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Carlin, a senior at Diamond Bar High School, began working at Sweats &amp; 
Surf last week, just in time to help take care of the booming business. "It's 
exciting and it gets you more into the Christmas spirit to see so many people 
shopping for presents," Carlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Brea-Olinda High School senior Liz Gates, who works with Carlin: "It does 
get busy and people get upset easily. They hate lines and want things right 
away. But I like working here." 
</P>
<P>
Both are working 20 to 30 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like when all my friends are playing, I'm at work," Carlin said. 
"They're all looking forward to Christmas break, waiting to play and party." 
</P>
<P>
Reasons for working instead of playing vary among the teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry Reinhardt, another senior at Brea-Olinda, has worked at Helen's 
Chocolates since March, 1988. "My sister worked here before," she said, "So I 
knew they had flexible hours that I could work with." 
</P>
<P>
Michele Heimos, a senior at Esperanza High School, works 15 to 20 hours a week 
at The Gap. "Soccer was over and I needed money for car payments, so I 
applied," she said. "It's hectic, but it's fun putting people's outfits 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Each winter, Brea Mall hires students to dress in costumes and work at Santa's 
Forest in the Center Court. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Loomis, a senior at Troy High School, dresses up three times a week in a 
period costume corresponding to "good King Wenceslaus" of the English Christmas 
carol. "It's a lot of fun," she said, "but sometimes you get tired of screaming 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
Josh Merold, a junior at El Dorado High School, joined Santa's Forest brigade 
because "I thought it'd be different and a challenge to work with little kids. 
It's real fast-paced and hectic. It's difficult to deal with parents and kids 
at the same time, trying to please them both, but I enjoy the job." 
</P>
<P>
Sean Malone, another junior at El Dorado, works the cash register in Santa's 
Forest. "Homework is a bummer with work," Malone said. "Sometimes I stay up 
late doing it, but work is a blast." 
</P>
<P>
As it is difficult to shop on an empty stomach, many of the mall's patrons 
eventually end up at the Food Court, where Katie White, a junior at Sunny Hills 
High School, works making cinnamon buns at Cinnabon. 
</P>
<P>
"Work has both good and bad sides," White said. "It's good because it gives me 
discipline and that helps me with school work. But it's hectic, it keeps you on 
your toes. I never have a moment's rest." 
</P>
<P>
But with her busy schedule, how does she have time to complete her holiday 
shopping? 
</P>
<P>
"I do miss out on shopping a little," White said, "but by the time I get home 
from work, I'm too tired to go shopping." Brea-Olinda senior Julue Navarro is 
happy to be spending part of her vacation working at Hot Dog On A Stick. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to sit at home all day," Navarro said about working over the 
holidays. "You're never bored, and you're always doing something. Work is 
something fun, but it does take a lot of my time. It's hard to balance school, 
work and a social life." JOOYOUNG LEE, Brea-Olinda High School

In this column (Legal View) two weeks ago, it was incorrectly reported that to 
use the method of substituted service in small claims court, a plaintiff must 
first use "due diligence" in trying to personally serve a defendant. In fact, 
in small claims court, the substituted service method described in the column 
may be used without first attempting personal service. See Code of Civil

Carson Float -- A story on Dec. 13 incorrectly reported that the Carson City 
Council voted to eliminate funding for a city float in future Rose parades. In 
fact, the council voted to notify parade officials of their interest in having 
a municipal float in the 1992 event. However, the council did not approve city 
funding for the float and some council members said the city will not make a 
financial commitment toward the cost of a float.

GIONIS CASE MISTRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
ACCUSED IN ASSAULT ON AISSA WAYNE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A mistrial was declared today after jurors failed to reach a verdict in an 
assault case that prosecutors allege stemmed from a bitter custody dispute over 
the late actor John Wayne's granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated for four days in the case of Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, 37, 
charged with eight felony counts in the Oct. 3, 1988, assault on his ex-wife, 
Aissa Wayne, before splitting 9-3 in favor of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
After the mistrial was declared, prosecutors, citing the majority in favor of 
conviction, announced that Gionis will be tried again. Shortly after noon, 
Superior Court Judge Theodore E. Millard set Jan. 24 as the date for further 
court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The hung jury "means that I am still innocent," Gionis said this morning. He 
remains free pending the new trial. An orthopedic surgeon from Pomona, Gionis 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Aissa Wayne was beaten and a companion, financier Roger W. Luby, was slashed in 
the attack that took place in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claim Gionis, involved in a bitter custody battle with Aissa Wayne 
over their then-1-year-old daughter, ordered the assault through a private 
investigator. During the trial, Gionis claimed he had nothing to do with the 
attack. The investigator and two gunmen have all admitted their roles. 
</P>
<P>
After the mistrial was declared, jurors said they had no hope of agreeing. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us thought that the prosecutor's argument about what happened was 
reasonable," one juror said. "But we were never going to convince those other 
three jurors." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the jury foreman told Millard that they were hopelessly 
deadlocked. But Millard sent the jurors back to deliberate when one said 
further talks might produce a verdict. Less than an hour later, Millard 
declared the mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments last week, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans 
reviewed key evidence of almost 40 telephone calls that took place among the 
four alleged co-conspirators in the case -- Gionis, private investigator O. Dan 
Gal of Century City, and the two assailants, Jerrel Hintergardt of Burbank and 
Jeffrey K. Bouey of Simi Valley -- before and after the assault. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor argued that the records showed close communication among Gionis 
and the assailants at the time of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Hintergardt, 39, who admitted he used a knife to slash Luby's Achilles' tendon 
but denied smashing Aissa Wayne's face into a concrete floor, is serving an 
eight-year prison sentence following his conviction at a separate trial. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis, a highly successful physician, faced the same charges as Hintergardt 
and could receive that same maximum sentence if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Bouey, 38, who also admitted his role, is expected to plea-bargain in exchange 
for his testimony against Hintergardt and Gionis. 
</P>
<P>
Gal, 34, has also agreed to cooperate with authorities, but he is awaiting 
trial and his status as a witness in the case remains unclear. He was not 
called by prosecutors to testify against Hintergardt. 
</P>
<P>
Gal had been hired by Gionis several months before the assault to conduct 
surveillance on Aissa Wayne, who had temporary custody of the child while a 
permanent custody hearing was pending, prosecutor Evans told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Gionis' attorney, John D. Barnett, had argued that the evidence was not enough 
to convict his client of participation in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter, Anastasia, is in the temporary custody of her mother.

A mistrial was declared today after jurors failed to reach a verdict in an 
assault case that prosecutors allege stemmed from a bitter custody dispute over 
the late actor John Wayne's granddaughter, Anastasia. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated for four days in the case of Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, 37, 
charged with eight felony counts in the Oct. 3, 1988, assault on his ex-wife, 
Aissa Wayne, before splitting 9-3 in favor of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
After the mistrial was declared, prosecutors, citing the majority in favor of 
conviction, announced that Gionis will be tried again. Shortly after noon, 
Superior Court Judge Theodore E. Millard set Jan. 24 as the date for further 
court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Aissa Wayne was beaten, and a companion, financier Roger W. Luby, was slashed 
in the attack in Newport Beach.

The state Supreme Court struck a severe blow to California's civil rights 
commission today, barring it from awarding damages for emotional distress or 
other personal harm caused by job discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-2 ruling eliminates the ability of the Fair Employment and Housing 
Commission to order damages for most victims of sexual or racial harassment, 
who commonly suffer no losses in salary but sue for the trauma and humiliation 
caused by employers' mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
Victims could still go to court and sue for a full range of damages. But suits 
are available only to those who can afford a lawyer, and generally take far 
longer than the commission's proceedings, which are prosecuted by a state 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The court said the commission is authorized only to order back pay and 
reinstatement for wrongfully fired employees and to require employers to 
prevent future discrimination.

SHEVARDNADZE RESIGNS;

<P>
GORBACHEV SAYS HE'S 'STUNNED'

<P>
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze resigned without warning today, telling 
Parliament that a reactionary resurgence threatened the Soviet Union with 
dictatorship. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he was stunned by the 
resignation of his longtime ally. 
</P>
<P>
"Dictatorship is coming," Shevardnadze told the Parliament, his voice choked 
with emotion. "No one knows what kind of dictatorship it will be, what kind of 
dictator will come, and what order things will take. 
</P>
<P>
"If you make a dictatorship, no one can say who will become the dictator." 
</P>
<P>
Hard-liners have been pushing Gorbachev to declare a state of emergency in 
troubled areas of the country, and he is asking the Congress of People's 
Deputies legislature to amend the constitution to further strengthen his power. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev took the podium hours later and said that before the resignation he 
had planned to make Shevardnadze his vice president, under a government 
reorganization that would put more power under presidential control. He did not 
say whether he is still considering Shevardnadze for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking slowly and calmly, Gorbachev said: "I don't want either to simplify 
the situation or over-dramatize it. The main thing is not to fall into panic 
or, even worse, hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
"I personally condemn" Shevardnadze for abandoning the perestroika reform 
program during a difficult time, the Soviet president said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said he knew nothing about any attempt to establish a dictatorship 
but told deputies that such a condition could arise if the country continues to 
sink into disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Gorbachev spoke, parliamentarians voted 1,540 to 52, with 11 
abstentions, to ask Shevardnadze to stay in the job. But Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Vitaly Churkin said the resignation was "irreversible." 
</P>
<P>
There was immediate speculation that Deputy Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, 
an Arab specialist who has been Gorbachev's personal envoy to the Persian Gulf, 
is a possible successor. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, waving his finger at lawmakers, blamed what he called reactionary 
forces for pushing the president to take dictatorial steps but he also implied 
that Gorbachev is acceding to their demands. 
</P>
<P>
The white-haired Georgian and second most visible figure in Soviet politics 
decried the influence of hard-line lawmakers "with colonels' shoulder-stripes" 
in the Congress, the country's highest legislative body. 
</P>
<P>
"I express my great gratitude to Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev," he said. "I am 
his friend. I think as he does, I have always supported and will until my last 
day support the ideas of perestroika, the idea of renewal, the ideas of 
democratization." 
</P>
<P>
"But I think that resignation is my duty as a person, a citizen, a Communist," 
he said, declaring that "the future belongs to democracy and freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, 62, was named foreign minister four months after Gorbachev became 
Communist Party chief in March, 1985. He helped steer Soviet foreign policy 
away from confrontation and conquest in favor of appeasement and coexistence.

HUSSEIN TO GET 'ASS KICKED' IN WAR -- BUSH

President Bush told members of Congress today that Saddam Hussein must be made 
to realize "he's going to get his ass kicked" if the United States goes to war 
against Iraq, a lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a White House meeting, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) quoted 
Bush as saying he is convinced the Iraqi leader does not understand what he is 
up against. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest potential for preventing any kind of an armed confrontation is to 
make sure that Saddam Hussein be made really aware that, to quote him (Bush), 
that 'If we get into an armed situation, he's going to get his ass kicked,' " 
Gallegly said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's remark was confirmed by another person at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush spoke, the Pentagon adopted an aggressive stance a day after a senior 
officer questioned American combat readiness in the Persian Gulf, warning 
Hussein that U.S. air power could punish Iraq even if ground forces are not 
ready for all-out war by Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials visiting the gulf and senior officers already there said 
today that Hussein should not interpret the comments by the deputy commander of 
America's gulf forces as a sign the United States would not attack until well 
past the U.N. deadline for withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Calvin A. H. Waller began the controversy in comments Wednesday to 
reporters accompanying Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on their weeklong gulf trip. 
</P>
<P>
Waller said ground forces yet to arrive in the region might not be combat-ready 
until well into February and recommended that Bush delay any military action 
until then. 
</P>
<P>
The commander of Army forces in Saudi Arabia, Lt. Gen. John Yeosock, was far 
more optimistic in comments today. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, we are ready to perform whatever mission we are called upon to carry 
out," Yeosock said. He promised "a violent, fast battle" if war begins.

END OF 2 KEY APARTHEID LAWS SEEN NEAR; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: GOVERNMENT REPORTED SET TO ANNOUNCE PLANS FOR REPEAL WHEN 
PARLIAMENT CONVENES ON FEB. 1.

<P>
A leading newspaper reported today that the government will announce plans to 
repeal major apartheid laws when Parliament opens Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Business Day said President Frederik W. de Klerk is expected to call for the 
scrapping of the Group Areas Act, which segregates neighborhoods by race, and 
the Land Acts, which reserve 87% of the country's land for the white minority. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, which opposes apartheid and has good contacts with top 
officials, said that the government may propose alternative measures but that 
they would be non-discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate government comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has promised changes in 1991 to the Group Areas Act on neighborhood 
discrimination and other discriminatory laws. But he has not specified a date 
or said whether the laws would be amended, replaced with new legislation or 
scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid groups have demanded the full repeal of the Group Areas Act, the 
Land Acts and the Population Registration Act, which classifies citizens by 
race. 
</P>
<P>
The president has said the Population Registration Act will be done away with 
only when a new constitution is negotiated with black opposition groups. He 
hopes to begin such talks early next year with the African National Congress 
and other anti-apartheid parties. 
</P>
<P>
Any proposed changes would require the approval of Parliament. But De Klerk's 
governing National Party controls the dominant white chamber of Parliament. 
Parliamentary chambers for Asians and people of mixed race would almost 
certainly approve such changes. 
</P>
<P>
There is no chamber for blacks, who account for about 30 million of the 
country's 40 million people. 
</P>
<P>
When opening Parliament last February, De Klerk legalized more than 60 
opposition groups, agreed to free political prisoners, including ANC leader 
Nelson Mandela, and pledged to dismantle the apartheid system of racial 
segregation. 
</P>
<P>
The main institutions still legally segregated are neighborhoods, public 
schools and the political system. Dozens of white public schools received 
permission to integrate in January after parents voted overwhelmingly to accept 
students of all races. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk on Tuesday offered amnesty to anyone who had left the country 
illegally.

People who drink only one cup of coffee or two cans of cola daily can 
experience caffeine withdrawal symptoms ranging from headaches to moodiness and 
nausea, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long recognized that heavy coffee drinkers are subject to 
withdrawal symptoms. But a new study has found unpleasant side effects when 
people with low-caffeine habits suddenly are denied the stimulant. 
</P>
<P>
"Previous studies documented the caffeine withdrawals under substantially 
higher doses," said Dr. Roland Griffiths, a professor of psychiatry and 
neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
"The general consensus of scientific opinion would have been that withdrawal 
might not have occurred at these low doses," he said. "We were astonished."

A congressman's car used to haul fertilizer a few weeks ago triggered a bomb 
scare at the White House today. 
</P>
<P>
The alert, which closed the West Wing driveway to traffic for about 50 minutes, 
was caused by a bomb-sniffing German shepherd who raised an alarm about Rep. 
Herbert Bateman's gray Lincoln while it was parked inside the White House 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
The Virginia Republican, with seven other congressmen, was there to brief 
President Bush on the group's recent trip to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fertilizer from some azaleas hauled in the back seat a few weeks ago," 
Bateman explained as he left the White House. "Great fun." 
</P>
<P>
But the alert prompted a full shutdown of traffic in and out of the driveway 
while a single security official, dressed in a green helmet and bulletproof 
vest, carefully combed the car.

Blue-chip stocks made a swift recovery today after diving 28 points on the 
surprise resignation of the Soviet foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 2.73 points at 2,629.46. The broader 
market lagged behind. Losing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered 
gainers by about 4 to 3. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 174.70 million shares, against 180.38 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks began the day trading sharply lower on news that Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze was resigning. 
</P>
<P>
"It creates so many question marks, so the reaction was to the downside," said 
Ron Doran, director of trading at C. L. King &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
But after traders absorbed the news, the blue chip index erased its losses and 
began to rally. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a strong market that seems to be able to shake off any negative news," 
said Tom Epperson, director of research at Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. "That's 
probably the type of market we'll have for the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
The market got some support from First National Bank of Chicago's decision to 
cut its prime lending rate to 9.5% from 10%, a move expected to be followed by 
other big banks. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rallied because of its status as a safe haven in times of 
uncertainty. It traded at 1.5010 German marks, compared with 1.4780 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Strength in International Business Machines Corp. also spilled over into the 
broader market. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a very nice rally in some bank stocks," said Gene Jay Seagle, 
director of technical research at Gruntal and Co. "And IBM is showing signs of 
becoming an important leader, something the market hasn't had for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Stock investors ignored a government report that personal income rose 0.3% and 
consumption rose 0.1% last month, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Midlantic Corp. fell after the banking company decided to omit its quarterly 
dividend. Its shares were off 3/4 to 5 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Apple Computer Inc. surged 2 to 43 7/8. An Alex Brown analyst said he upgraded 
his rating to a "strong buy" and raised his earnings estimates.

Shearson Lehman Bros. raised its rating on 18 U.S. regional banks, including

BANK OF CHICAGO DROPS ITS PRIME RATE TO 9.5% AFTER ACTION BY FED

One of the nation's largest banks cut its prime lending rate by a steep 0.5 
percentage point to 9.5% today, two days after the Federal Reserve lowered one 
of its key lending rates in an effort to prevent the recession from deepening. 
</P>
<P>
First National Bank of Chicago, the 13th-largest U.S. banking company, said it 
lowered its prime rate from 10% effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the month, a handful of regional banks took a more cautious step by 
easing their prime rates to 9.75%, but analysts said larger institutions were 
waiting for a cue from the Fed before following suit. 
</P>
<P>
The recent decline in the prime rate, which serves as a guide for bank lending 
charges for a host of business and consumer loans, marks the first cut in the 
rate in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a long-overdue adjustment," said William Sullivan, director of money 
market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The fact that this is the first 
major national money center bank to go might trigger others to follow soon." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan noted that the 0.5 percentage point cut was a bit steeper than had 
been expected, but he said it indicated that banks "are finally taking the 
message that the Fed wants rates lower." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the Fed cut the discount rate -- the interest it charges on loans to 
member banks -- to 6.5% from 7%, the first decline in the rate since August, 
1986. But in addition, the Fed has also been gradually cutting the federal 
funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed funds rate has been eased twice this month alone. It was trimmed a 
quarter of a percentage point on Dec. 7 and since has fallen to 7%. 
</P>
<P>
Today's prime rate cut "is clearly in response to the Fed's recent actions, 
which included not only a drop in the funds rate but a downward adjustment in 
the discount rate," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
James Annable, First Chicago's chief economist, said that by easing the Fed 
funds rate, the nation's central bank "is telling the market that we are taking 
this recession seriously." And once that rate moved lower, it was time to "pass 
it on to our customers." 
</P>
<P>
Annable said consumers should see declines next month on loans that are tied to 
the prime rate, such as home equity lines of credit.

Businesses plan to increase their spending for new plants and equipment by an 
estimated 2.4% next year, the lowest spending level in four years, the Commerce 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
The level of capital spending, an indication of confidence among the nation's 
business sector, is the lowest since 1986 when spending declined 3.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses plan to spend $547 billion on new plants and equipment next year. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about the economy is slowing business expansions during the fourth 
quarter. Overall, capital spending increased 5.2% this year to an estimated 
$534 billion from $507 billion last year. The government said this year's 
figures reflect a downward revision from the planned increase of 5.4% reported 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing industries plan to boost spending 0.7% next year after a 4.6% 
increase this year. Companies that make durable goods plan to cut spending 0.8% 
next year.

Rupert Murdoch was forced today to answer market fears about News Corp.'s debt 
rollover plans after the company's share price plummeted to its lowest level in 
more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the market, which sent News Corp. shares down more than 20% to a 
low of $4.20, was also jittery about reported allegations in a British 
television program about the company that was due to be screened tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch issued a brief statement after the Australian Stock Exchange asked News 
Corp., one of the world's largest media empires, to explain the sharp fall in 
its share price in the first half hour of trade. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is very pleased with the progress of its negotiations for the 
rescheduling of the major part of the News group's debt," he said.

VERNON SAVINGS OWNER DIXON FOUND GUILTY

Don R. Dixon, one of the first savings and loan owners to be accused of fraud 
in the industry's nationwide debacle, was convicted today of using depositor 
money to finance a high-flying life. 
</P>
<P>
A jury of eight men and four women deliberated two weeks before convicting 
Dixon on 23 counts of a 38-count indictment that accused him of using thousands 
of dollars from Vernon Savings Assn. to finance extravagances that included 
California beach-house parties. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon, 52, owned Vernon from 1981 to 1986, when it grew tenfold. The thrift's 
failure in 1987 cost taxpayers $1.3 billion and was one of the first costly 
collapses of the savings and loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon had been indicted earlier this year for misapplication of funds, making 
false statements and other crimes. If convicted on all charges, he could have 
been sentenced to 190 years in jail and fined as much as $9.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
He watched impassively while the verdict was read and embraced his tearful wife 
after the hearing concluded. U.S. District Judge Joe Fish set sentencing for 
Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony lasted more than five weeks with about two dozen witnesses, including 
Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
Some former Vernon employees testified Dixon directed them to reimburse 
themselves with the thrift's money for political contributions. Others said he 
ordered them to hire prostitutes for parties at a beach house near San Diego.

A BASIC ANSWER TO BASEBALL INJURIES; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: SO-CALLED BREAKAWAY BASES WOULD PREVENT 1.7 MILLION INJURIES, SAVING $2 
BILLION IN MEDICAL COSTS IF USED NATIONWIDE, A STUDY SAYS.

<P>
Baseball bases that move on impact would prevent 1.7 million injuries, saving 
$2 billion in medical costs if used nationwide, a study has found. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit Institute for Preventive Sports Medicine said the skyrocketing 
growth of recreational sports has made amateur athletes' safety a major public 
health goal. 
</P>
<P>
"Recreational sports injuries are expensive to families, employers and the 
entire community," said Dr. David Janda, director of the Ann Arbor institute. 
</P>
<P>
So-called breakaway bases, attached to rubber grommets set in the ground, 
release on impact, unlike conventional bases. A three-year study showed they 
virtually eliminated the ankle, knee, leg, hand and wrist injuries caused when 
softball players slide into bases anchored to the ground, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers initially compared injuries on fields at the University of 
Michigan, some of which had stationary bases and some equipped with breakaway 
bases, the health care organization said. 
</P>
<P>
In more than 1,200 games, 45 players were injured sliding into stationary bases 
but only two were hurt sliding into breakaway bases, Janda said. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the study covered 1,035 games on fields using only 
breakaway bases. Only two sliding-related injuries -- each an ankle sprain -- 
were reported, Janda said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many communities and leagues, including minor-league baseball teams, have 
begun to use breakaway bases and have reduced sliding injuries without 
affecting the outcome of the game," Janda said. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Tigers' London, Ontario, affiliate in the Double-A Eastern League 
uses breakaway bases, and institute spokesman Gorden Blain said the entire 
league might use them in 1991.

Jimmye Laycock changed his mind overnight and will not leave William &amp; Mary 
to become football coach at Boston College, BC Athletic Director Chet Gladchuck 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Gladchuck said Laycock called him at 5:30 this morning and said he had been up 
all night with his family and that leaving William &amp; Mary would be too 
difficult for him and his family. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised, but nevertheless I've seen it happen before at this level," 
Gladchuck said. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference today in Williamsburg, Laycock said: "Boston College and 
the people there were outstanding. After assessing the situation, my decision 
to remain in Williamsburg is based purely on personal grounds." 
</P>
<P>
Laycock, a 1970 William &amp; Mary graduate, had resigned Wednesday after 11 
years as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously pleased that Jimmye will continue his leadership of our 
football program," said John Randolph, William &amp; Mary's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gladchuck: "I can't control a man's emotions, and that's what happened in 
this case. I respect his loyalty. . . . I would never, ever criticize a man for 
putting his family first. That's what Jimmye has done, and I respect him." 
</P>
<P>
Laycock, 42, has led William &amp; Mary into the Division I-AA playoffs in 
three of the past five years.

cher Don Slaught, who became the third free agent to return to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates by accepting salary arbitration on Wednesday, today agreed to a 
three-year contract worth about $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates and Slaught, 32, have been near a deal for nearly two weeks, but 
negotiations over incentive clauses held up a final agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"How long ago was it that only the greatest players earned $1 million?" Slaught 
said. "I remember asking George Brett, 'What's your paycheck like? What do you 
buy, a condo every two weeks?' " 
</P>
<P>
To make room for Slaught on their 40-man roster, the Pirates released 
Cangelosi.

STATE HIGH COURT TO HEAR DRUG-TEST APPEAL; 
</P>
<P>
ATHLETICS: ACTION SETS ASIDE RULING THAT NCAA PROGRAM VIOLATES RIGHT TO PRIVACY 
UNDER CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. 
</P>

<P>
The state Supreme Court agreed today to hear an NCAA appeal to allow drug 
testing of college athletes in California. 
</P>
<P>
The court's action sets aside a lower-court ruling, in a suit by Stanford 
University athletes, that the NCAA drug-testing program violated the right to 
privacy under the California Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Justices Edward A. Panelli, David N. 
Eagleson and Armand Arabian, forming a majority on the seven-member court, 
voted to grant a hearing on the NCAA's appeal. No hearing date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
It is also the first private drug-testing case accepted for review by the 
court, and could determine the scope of the state constitutional guarantee of 
privacy as it applies to drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
California privacy rights, unlike those recognized under the U.S. Constitution, 
have been interpreted to protect individuals from intrusions by private as well 
as governmental entities. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the NCAA is a 
private organization. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Sept. 25 by the 6th District Court of Appeal in San Jose was the 
first by any appellate court in the nation against the drug-testing program. It 
prohibited involuntary drug testing of Stanford athletes in any competition 
inside or outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court's ruling will apply to all California college athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA since 1986 has conducted random drug testing of athletes in 
championship contests and postseason football games, looking for six categories 
of drugs, including steroids. To be eligible during the season, all athletes 
must sign forms consenting to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the NCAA began year-round testing of football players for steroids 
and two other types of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court's 3-0 ruling said the NCAA had failed to show that the 
testing program was necessary or effective, that there was significant drug use 
by college athletes or that testing would protect athletes or the integrity of 
the competition. 
</P>
<P>
The court also said the NCAA had not tried alternatives, such as drug 
education. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking Supreme Court review, NCAA lawyers said drug education could not 
assure athletes their competitors were not using drugs.

2 COACHES WARM UP WITH INSULTS

It wouldn't be Philadelphia-Dallas week if Buddy Ryan and Jimmy Johnson didn't 
exchange insults. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia Coach Ryan insists he can't even remember Johnson's name. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Coach Johnson thinks Ryan must be getting senile. 
</P>
<P>
Dealings between the two haven't been civil since Johnson accused Ryan of 
placing a bounty on some Dallas players in last year's Thanksgiving Day game, 
which Ryan's Eagles won, 27-0. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a bad Thanksgiving Day and their coach, whatever his name is, 
instead of just taking the heat for a bad game plan, he made it into a bounty 
bowl," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Buddy is getting senile, I don't know," Johnson countered. "I guess it's 
good for our guys to understand the mentality of the team we are playing." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas, which lost to Philadelphia 21-20 earlier in the year, visits Veterans 
Stadium on Sunday with a possible wild-card playoff berth at stake. 
</P>
<P>
If Dallas wins and Detroit beats Green Bay, the Cowboys would earn the third 
NFC wild-card berth. Philadelphia has already clinched a wild card. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who is 0-3 against Ryan, said he understands the philosophy involved 
in Ryan's verbal insults. 
</P>
<P>
"He enjoys needling people and getting under your skin when he has the upper 
hand," Johnson said. "You didn't see a lot of quotes early in the season when 
he was losing. He clinched a playoff spot, and now you hear him." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Dallas will have a more competitive team than the one beaten 20-10 
in Philadelphia last year. Johnson and the team were snowballed by the fans 
when they left the field. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a dark season, not just that day," Johnson said of the 1-15 record of 
his rookie campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a miserable year, particularly knowing you didn't have a chance to win, 
but now we are more confident and know we will win if we have prepared 
ourselves," Johnson said.

LIZ SMITH: CHER HAS HER EYE ON A REVEALING ROLE: GYPSY ROSE LEE

THE FABULOUS Cher won an Oscar for "Moonstruck," but she still has a child's 
delight in taking on roles that afford the chance to dress up and carry on like 
a mad thing. (Catch Cher in "Mermaids," and you'll see what I mean.) 
</P>
<P>
But now the star has optioned a work that will afford the opportunity to 
"undress" and carry on. Cher is interested in portraying Gypsy Rose Lee, the 
legendary stripper of the '40s. No, she won't do a remake of the musical 
"Gypsy," but Cher has her eye on the Eric Preminger book "Gypsy and Me," a 
true-to-life, Auntie Mameish-type tale of a boy and his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Eric is the son of the late Gypsy and movie director Otto Preminger. He was 
born out of wedlock when such a detail could kill a career. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has ever done total justice to the totality that grew to be Gypsy Rose 
Lee -- stripper, philosopher, socialite, writer, painter, actress and sister to 
another great talent, June Havoc. This is a role Cher should really be able to 
sink into -- up to her hips. 
</P>
<P>
KIM BASINGER doesn't have warm and cuddly memories of making "Batman." She 
tells Lawrence Grobel in Movieline that "Jack Nicholson made money. 
Peters-Guber, they made money. And Warner Bros., of course, made money. But 
none of the rest of us made anything. We got raped; everybody did. It was a 
rape deal; it really was." 
</P>
<P>
Kim says she wasn't just another pretty face in "Batman." She claims to have 
made contributions to the script: "I saw what was missing from 'Batman.' I saw 
the reconstruction work that should be done . . . so I just rewrote a lot of 
this crap." (Take that, screenwriters Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren.) 
</P>
<P>
Kim isn't entirely dour and serious in this interview. She talks of her sexy 
public appearances and how she selects what she wears -- low-cut, transparent, 
split up the front items. "I dress mostly for me. And I find myself dressing 
for the fans, because they have fun. What does the word movie STAR mean, 
anyway? It's not a medical student. It's a movie star, right?"

FRENCH MASTERPIECES FOUND IN BERLIN MUSEUM;

<P>
ART: THE 28 PAINTINGS SEIZED BY NAZIS HAD BEEN HIDDEN IN AN ARMOIRE SINCE 1972,

<P>
Twenty-eight French masterpieces seized by the Nazis during World War II, 
including paintings by Monet, Renoir and Gauguin, have been found in a cupboard 
at a Berlin museum, a news magazine reported today. 
</P>
<P>
This week's cover story in L'Express described how the works seized from 
private citizens between 1942 and 1944 have been locked away since 1972, their 
existence known to only a handful of people. 
</P>
<P>
According to the magazine, the Department of French National Museums learned 
that the works existed in 1975 but "was not interested because the works did 
not come from national collections." 
</P>
<P>
"Never did the prestigious department think of consulting its experts or 
glancing through the catalogues of the artists in question," l'Express wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The paintings included Claude Monet's "Route, Effet d'Hiver. Soleil Couchant 
(Road, Effect. Sunset)"; Eugene Delacroix's "Jeune Homme (Young Man)"; Auguste 
Renoir's "Coco Ecrivant (Coco Writing)"; and Paul Gauguin's "La Falaise (The 
Cliff)." They were examined by l'Express reporters, who said they were in 
excellent condition. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvie Poujade, a French museum spokeswoman, said her department learned of the 
paintings' existence a month ago when contacted by l'Express reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We searched our archives and did not find proof that the department had ever 
received a list of works from Berlin," Poujade said. 
</P>
<P>
Poujade said French museums are considered "depositories of state property 
which they are expected to conserve and display in good condition."

"Our role is not to track down or recuperate artworks not considered state 
property. That's the job of other government offices," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine quoted Lothar Brauner, curator at the Nationalgalerie, in formerly 
East Berlin, as saying he received the works on May 19, 1972, from an 
unidentified person claiming to have gotten them from a third party. 
</P>
<P>
A legal document drawn up that day shows that the person wished to hand over 
the paintings "so that they would be properly preserved until being returned to 
their rightful owners." 
</P>
<P>
Brauner said he did not know who the rightful owners were. 
</P>
<P>
According to l'Express, French museum authorities were informed that the works 
were in Berlin by the French Foreign Affairs Ministry, which had been contacted 
by authorities in eastern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
L'Express recounted how Brauner and his wife, a restoration expert, locked the 
paintings in a yellow wooden armoire and equipped it with a pail of water and a 
hydrometer to measure the humidity. From time to time, they would check the 
paintings' condition, the magazine wrote. 
</P>
<P>
During the war, the Nazis sought to amass as much art as possible to fulfill 
Hitler's dream of creating a European arts center in his native Linz, Austria. 
Several of his aides, including Martin Bormann and Hermann Goring, were also 
art collectors and rerouted much of the booty into their own hands.

BERTOLUCCI CLEAR FOR BUDDHA FILM

Italian film director Bernardo Bertolucci can go ahead with a movie on the life 
of Buddha. A London court Wednesday rejected a Hong Kong company's bid for an 
injunction stopping the director. 
</P>
<P>
Waco Productions Ltd. of Hong Kong announced plans in September to make a film 
based on the life of Buddha to be directed by Bertolucci, whose previous films 
include "The Last Emperor," "Last Tango in Paris" and his newest, "The 
Sheltering Sky." 
</P>
<P>
But negotiations broke down, and the director announced that he was seeking 
financial backers for an independent project on the same theme. 
</P>
<P>
The film company claimed the idea for the film and a historical synopsis shown 
to Bertolucci were original and confidential and sought an injunction to stop 
him from exploiting the material. 
</P>
<P>
The court agreed that Waco Productions Ltd. Chairman Richard Colson had spent 
time and $1.4 million on planning for the film. 
</P>
<P>
But the judge said that no injunction could be granted in such broad terms and 
that there was no evidence that Bertolucci was in any way threatening to use 
any original or confidential ideas from Waco.

Country singer Willie Nelson won't have to put his land on the auction block 
this month, but the IRS hasn't forgotten about him. 
</P>
<P>
A Dec. 27 auction at the Travis County Courthouse won't take place as 
advertised, Internal Revenue Service spokeswoman Jamie Stewart said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS last month seized Nelson's properties in several states to ensure 
payment of $16.7 million in taxes it says the Grammy award-winning singer owes. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson says his tax problems were caused by poor handling of his finances by a 
previous business manager. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are continuing to compile a list of Nelson's holdings, Stewart said. 
Once that accounting is completed, probably around the first of the year, an 
auction or auctions can be set for all his property. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising efforts have been undertaken for Nelson and donations have been 
received from several states, organizers say.

* The long-awaited sequel to "The Godfather" (1972) and "The Godfather -- Part 
II" (1974), both Oscar-winners as Best Picture, will finally reach movie 
screens on Christmas Day. Superstar Al Pacino reprises his character of Michael 
Corleone, with Andy Garcia in the role of Pacino's illegitimate nephew. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Cuba, Garcia was 5 when his parents moved to Miami in 1961. While his 
family built a multimillion-dollar fragrance empire, the handsome young man was 
bitten by the acting bug. His career includes the films "A Show of Force," 
"Stand and Deliver," and "The Untouchables," as well as television and stage 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
* The newly released $35-million movie epic, "Havana," is a love story set 
against the 1959 Cuban Revolution. It stars Robert Redford as a gambler whose 
life is changed when he becomes involved with an aristocratic revolutionary's 
wife, played by Lena Olin. Raul Julia co-stars. During the filming in the 
Dominican Republic, Redford expressed his desire to learn Spanish to "have more 
contact with Latin America." The actor, who has directed such movies as 
"Milagro Beanfield War," added, "There are many films coming out of Latin 
American countries that don't carry big budgets but which are of undeniable 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
* An L.A.-based singer, "rapper" Que Pasa, is making a splash in the Latino 
recording industry. His hit "Mami yo te quiero" ("Mommy, I Love You") is in the 
Top 10 in several Spanish-speaking countries, reaching number one in Argentina 
and Chile. Que Pasa was born in Venezuela and raised in the United States. 
After graduating from college, he worked as a sound engineer before switching 
to a recording career. Unlike traditional "rap" music, Que Pasa's songs combine 
traditional Latino rhythms, lyrics and instrumentation, making for a very 
distinct new sound. ELENA KELLNER

BELMONT'S CROSS-COUNTRY RUNNERS CREATING AN ENDURING TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voices of encouragement rose from the hills that make up the Pierce College 
three-mile cross-country course as the runners in the City Section high school 
boys' varsity competition raced by. 
</P>
<P>
The cheers of the Belmont High School contingent, one of several from the many 
participating schools, reached a crescendo when their own Rene Arellano 
appeared from behind a blind curve about 20 yards from the finish line on his 
way to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Then more green and black Belmont jerseys dashed by. There was Sergio Lopez in 
fifth place, David Arias in 10th with Augusto Leal right behind, and Epifanio 
Roman in 13th place. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the team broke into a resounding "Belmont, Belmont, Belmont" chant 
and carried Coach Gordon Weisenburger on their shoulders, signifying that the 
Los Angeles school had won its eighth boys' varsity team title in the last nine 
years thanks not only to a corps of talented athletes but also to team unity. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an emotional pitch, an emotional high for them," said Weisenburger, a 
23-year coaching veteran at the school who calls himself a converted football 
coach. "The more I'm around athletics the more I think that emotions are so 
important." 
</P>
<P>
The Belmont teams didn't lack emotion or anything else on that day last month. 
They swept the four divisions contested, regaining the boys' varsity title they 
had lost to Taft in 1989 and successfully defending their girls' title. No 
other city school had ever won the boys' and girls' championships in the same 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In the following week, competing against the top Division I teams in the state, 
the boys team finished in fourth place and Arellano placed fourth individually. 
The girls team ended up in ninth place at the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
The Sentinels had entered the city finals with an undefeated Northern League 
dual-meet streak going back nine years in boys' varsity and back to 1984 in 
girls' varsity. 
</P>
<P>
In the city finals, Belmont took the boys' varsity competition with 32 points, 
ahead of Garfield and Taft, with 107 each. 
</P>
<P>
(In cross-country, the object is to score the least number of points under a 
system that awards one point for first place, two points for second, three 
points for third and so on. The scores of the top five runners, without 
counting runners from schools not involved in the team competition, are 
combined for the team score.) 
</P>
<P>
The Belmont runners outdistanced San Pedro, 19 points to 108 in girls' varsity; 
defeated Garfield in boys' junior varsity, 20-79, and beat Birmingham in boys' 
freshman/sophomore, 38-81. 
</P>
<P>
The results proved that Weisenburger's training methods, which involve three 
stages during the year -- light training from July to August, intensive from 
September to the middle of the league season and a "maintaining" phase through 
the city and state finals -- is right on target. 
</P>
<P>
Those sessions include nine to 10 miles of hill work in Elysian Park during the 
intensive part of the training. Not exactly a job for the weary. 
</P>
<P>
"For heart, this team is my best ever," Weisenburger said right after the city 
championship meet. "That was an unbelievable performance today by Arellano. 
He's been out two days this week with an impacted wisdom tooth. The doctor 
wanted to do surgery. He was still in pain this morning." 
</P>
<P>
But not enough to keep Arellano from running. "I expected to finish among the 
top five, but I didn't think I would win," said the 18-year-old senior, who is 
originally from Cuernavaca, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Arellano ran the course in 14 minutes, 58 seconds -- eight seconds ahead of one 
of the favorites, Steve Gonzales of Carson. Gonzales had defeated Arellano by 
24 seconds in the preliminaries the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized I could win it around the second mile," Arellano said. "The support 
of the alumni and of my teammates helped me." 
</P>
<P>
The camaraderie theme was echoed by 14-year-old Alma Herrera, a ninth-grader 
who ran a 19:20 and finished fourth in the girls' division, nine seconds ahead 
of teammate Patty Trejo. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate all the encouragement of my teachers and teammates," said the 
petite runner born in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a family atmosphere; that's the reason for our success," Weisenburger 
said, downplaying his contribution. "Tradition and family atmosphere. The kids 
enjoy being with one another. It's a neat situation." 
</P>
<P>
One that, among other things, helps win championships. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield High missed going to the state finals because of an error in the 
computation of the boys' varsity scores during the city finals. Garfield should 
have been awarded the berth instead of Taft because its sixth-place runner 
finished ahead of Taft's. But City officials said the error was discovered too 
late to correct, although state meet officials later said they would have 
permitted Garfield's participation anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
"Six of my top seven runners are seniors and it was their dream to run in the 
state meet," lamented Garfield Coach Steve Wright when he was told of the 
mistake. "They earned the right." 
</P>
<P>
At the junior-college level, Guatemalan-born Hugo Allan Garcia of Glendale 
College won the state cross-country title. Oscar Gonzalez of Long Beach City 
College was second.

MORRIS DEVELOPS A JUGGERNAUT; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: GLENDALE TOURNAMENT TITLE THE LATEST NOTCH IN THE BELT OF LOS 
ANGELES CITY COLLEGE.

Reggie Morris recruited his first basketball team at Los Angeles City College 
in 1988 by showing prospective players the campus, the schedule of classes and 
just about everything related to the school except the gym. 
</P>
<P>
LACC was reviving its program after a budget-induced four-year hiatus that had 
left the facility in shambles. Morris, therefore, turned to other arenas of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had brought anyone into that gym and said, 'OK, come here, it's going to 
be great,' there's no way anyone would have shown up to play," Morris recalled. 
"We had chains on the door. Every time they asked about the gym, I said, 'Don't 
worry about it, it's being renovated right now.' " 
</P>
<P>
Today, the LACC gym has new paint, new windows and a two-tone floor. Doors that 
were once locked out of embarrassment are now opened with pride. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a three-year process," Morris said. "There are high school 
tournaments there now. People are wanting to play in the gym." 
</P>
<P>
And college players, in increasing numbers, desire to play for Morris, a highly 
successful coach and counselor at Manual Arts High who has quickly and quietly 
built a successful program at LACC. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the Cubs defeated Valley, Cypress and College of the Canyons to 
win the Glendale tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The victories improved the Cubs' record to 10-2, giving Morris a 56-21 mark in 
his two plus seasons at the community college level. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have always been there (in the LACC area)," Glendale Coach Brian 
Beauchemin said. "But it takes organization and structure to attract them and 
that's what Reggie has provided." 
</P>
<P>
Morris, 41, was a standout in basketball and track at Washington High and went 
on to compete in both sports at Los Angeles Harbor College and San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
He coached varsity basketball for 11 seasons at Manual Arts where his teams 
won: 
</P>
<P>
* seven league championships. 
</P>
<P>
* two City 4-A championships. 
</P>
<P>
* the 1988 state title. 
</P>
<P>
Morris also established himself as a pioneer of sorts in crisis counseling for 
high school students. 
</P>
<P>
He helped students troubled by gang pressures, family situations and other 
personal problems by talking with them and referring them to local agencies. He 
started a program called "There Must Be Alternatives," designed to help 
athletes and other students resist or overcome gangs, drugs and illiteracy by 
inviting guest speakers to address the student body at Manual Arts and at other 
Los Angeles high schools, junior highs and churches. 
</P>
<P>
When LACC offered him the coaching job and a career counseling position, Morris 
said he was faced with a difficult decision. He agreed to join the LACC staff 
when he was guaranteed that the basketball program would be funded on par with 
other community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy where I was at," he said. "I would not have come to a makeshift 
program set up for failure. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, I had been at Manual for 11 seasons so it was a new 
challenge. If I was going to have a chance to move up as a coach, I needed to 
make the move." 
</P>
<P>
Hired in July of 1988, Morris made up for lost recruiting time by focusing his 
efforts on former Manual Arts and Dorsey High players. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988-89 the Cubs averaged 102 points a game, finished 22-9 and won the 
Southern California Conference with a 13-1 record before losing in the final of 
the Southern California regional of the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman Watson (St. Mary's) and Chris Small (New Mexico State) from that team 
went on to play at Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Cubs averaged 104 points a game, finished 23-10 and went 
unbeaten through conference before losing in the second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
This season, LACC has fallen behind by as many as 19 points at halftime, then 
come back to win. The Cubs' only two losses were to Cypress, who they have 
beaten twice, and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore forward Charlo Davis leads the team, averaging 18 points a game. 
Sophomore guard Develle Walker, who redshirted last season after an 
all-conference season in 1988, is averaging 17 points. Freshman forward Sean 
Hopson is averaging 11 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be no continuity at LACC," Canyons Coach Lee Smelser said. 
"Reggie has certainly brought that to the program. He's brought in some people 
with his name and his record. Now you have to reckon with LACC." 
</P>
<P>
Morris expects the winning tradition to continue. "We're getting people that 
really want to do it," Morris said. "It's tough sometimes to convince people 
that going away to college is not always the best alternative. There are some 
positive things to be had in staying at home and in having your family and 
friends be able to see you." 
</P>
<P>
Morris hopes to one day move up to the four-year level. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there is a lot of pressure and sometimes that can make you feel 
insecure," he said. "But as a competitor, you like to keep moving and satisfy 
that challenging instinct. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, though, I'm happy to be building this program and giving kids 
from the inner city a chance to continue their basketball and academic 
careers."
