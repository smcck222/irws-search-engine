ALBERT C. WEDEMEYER, 92; SOLDIER-DIPLOMAT HELPED SHAPE POSTWAR POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Albert Coady Wedemeyer, one of the few ranking staff officers who shaped 
America's military strategy during World War II and its diplomatic policy in 
the years immediately following, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported Wednesday that the four-star general died Sunday 
at a retirement center at Ft. Belvoir, Va. He was 92 and had been in declining 
health after moving earlier this year to the Belvoir Woods Health Care Center 
from the farm he called "Friends Advice" in the small community of Boyds, Md. 
</P>
<P>
He died four decades after the disagreements that split American and British 
planners had become the stuff of history. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1897 in Omaha, Wedemeyer entered West Point in 1915. He graduated in 
1919, a member of a class that included such celebrated combat soldiers of 
World War II as Anthony C. McAuliffe, commander of the 101st Airborne during 
the Battle of the Bulge; Air Force Gen. Nathan Twining, later chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Al Gruenther, who would rise to become the supreme 
commander in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But Wedemeyer's skills lay not in command, somewhat to his chagrin. Like his 
mentor, George C. Marshall, Wedemeyer -- who longed for duty with troops -- 
found himself assigned to a prewar succession of staff positions. 
</P>
<P>
Caught behind a large number of World War I veterans on the promotion lists, 
Wedemeyer and his classmates spent 17 years as lieutenants, and four more as 
captains. They finally achieved the rank of major in 1940 only after then-Chief 
of Staff Marshall reformed the Army's promotion policies to eliminate what he 
privately termed "the arteriosclerosis." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the young officer served on a succession of posts in the 
caste-conscious, socially isolated peacetime Army -- at Ft. Benning, Ga.; twice 
in the Philippines; in Washington, and in Tientsin, China, then widely regarded 
as the Army's choicest assignment in those sleepy between-war years. 
</P>
<P>
It was while traveling on an Army troopship to the Philippines in 1923 that the 
lean, blond Wedemeyer met his future wife, Elizabeth Dade Embick, daughter of 
an Army colonel. 
</P>
<P>
They were married in 1925 on Corregidor Island in Manila Bay. Their first son 
was born the following year, their second in 1928. Six grandchildren and nine 
great-grandchildren also survive him. 
</P>
<P>
Wedemeyer came to be a member of a small circle of soldier-scholars. Unlike 
many, he was an outspoken supporter of Germany as a major power -- perhaps 
because of his own Germanic heritage. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1936, the Army sent then-Capt. Wedemeyer to attend the German War 
College in Berlin. (A handful of German officers were training at American 
military schools.) The two-year tour had a profound influence on him and his 
later career. He learned the evolving principles of blitzkrieg and the 
Luftwaffe's innovative use of aircraft as artillery for fast-moving armored 
columns. He also came to share the German general staff's realpolitik and its 
abiding antipathy to the Soviet Union. Wedemeyer returned to the United States 
as one of the few men in the U.S. Army with an appreciation for the war-making 
machine that the Wehrmacht would unloose in September, 1939. He also returned a 
fervent anti-communist. 
</P>
<P>
"I was convinced that the American people did not want to supplant Nazism by 
communism," he wrote in his best-selling autobiography, "Wedemeyer Reports!" 
</P>
<P>
That prejudice was to cloud his future career as a diplomat, although Marshall 
would remain a stalwart defender of the newly promoted major he assigned in 
1941 to the war plans division of the General Staff. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately Marshall -- who had trouble remembering names -- put "that 
long-legged major in war plans" to work on the so-called Victory Program, the 
secret, vitally important national estimate of what manpower and industry were 
necessary to defeat the Axis. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Wedemeyer found himself, ironically, drafting the master industrialization 
plan that would lead to the defeat of a nation he admired, Germany, while the 
United States allied itself with a political system, communism, that he 
despised. 
</P>
<P>
Mountbatten's Deputy 
</P>
<P>
It was at the 1943 Quebec Conference that British Adm. Louis Mountbatten asked 
for Wedemeyer to serve as his deputy in the newly created Southeast Asia 
Command. Marshall agreed, and Wedemeyer, by then a two-star general, found 
himself in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 28, 1944, Marshall ordered Wedemeyer's transfer to Chongqing, China, to 
replace the outspoken Joseph (Vinegar Joe) Stilwell as commander of the China 
Theater. More important, Wedemeyer was also to assume Stilwell's post as chief 
of staff to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese Nationalist leader. 
</P>
<P>
"My orders for assignment to China came as a bombshell," Wedemeyer acknowledged 
in his autobiography. Wedemeyer the soldier suddenly found himself in the 
delicate position of diplomat with no training and no warning. 
</P>
<P>
"Using honey for my part instead of vinegar," Wedemeyer sought to woo Chiang. 
He was no more successful in convincing the generalissimo to field an army 
against the Japanese than Stilwell had been. Instead, with Wedemeyer's tacit 
cooperation, Chiang hoarded military supplies for the postwar struggle with Mao 
Zedong's communist forces. "Although it took me some time to acquire 
confirmation of the ruthless objectives of the Chinese communists, I had no 
illusions concerning them from the outset," Wedemeyer said later. 
</P>
<P>
The war ended with Chiang jockeying for position with the communists in a 
renewal of civil war that had wracked that country since the early years of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
When the U.S. ambassador to Chongqing, Patrick V. Hurley, resigned in 1945, his 
political duties fell to Wedemeyer. By then a three-star general, Wedemeyer 
thus became the first of the military men who would redirect American 
diplomatic policy in the decisive years after the war. (That group included, 
among others, Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, later ambassador to the Soviet Union; 
Gen. Lucius D. Clay, U.S. high commissioner in West Germany; and two future 
secretaries of state, Chief of Staff Marshall, and a young colonel then on 
Wedemeyer's staff, Dean Rusk.) 
</P>
<P>
Wedemeyer lined up behind Chiang, despite "the weaknesses and the oppressive 
character of the Nationalist government and its decreasing popular support," as 
he wrote later. But "communist totalitarian tyranny would be infinitely worse," 
he continued. 
</P>
<P>
Wedemeyer found himself at odds with the policies of his former chief, 
Marshall, who spent 1946 as a special envoy in China attempting to end the 
civil war in that weary nation. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, Wedemeyer wrote in his autobiography, "approached the problem of 
unifying China on the false supposition that the Chinese communists were not 
real communists under Moscow's command but simply a Chinese faction that could 
be induced by diplomatic negotiations to come to terms with the Nationalist 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Effort Collapses 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's yearlong effort to sponsor a coalition government in postwar China 
collapsed, leaving Chiang's Nationalists to futilely fight off Mao Zedong's 
communists. Inexorably, communist field armies pushed Chiang's beleaguered 
forces into smaller and smaller pockets. 
</P>
<P>
When the Nationalists fled to Formosa in 1949, Republican Party leaders, 
including the querulous Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin, demanded to know 
"who lost China." Seeking to embarrass President Harry S. Truman and the 
Democratic Party, McCarthy and other members of what would become known as "the 
China Lobby" attacked Marshall as a traitor. 
</P>
<P>
Wedemeyer, named ambassador to China in l947, found himself at the center of 
one of these "who-lost-China" squabbles when his report on the Nationalist 
government was suppressed by Truman. GOP spokesmen charged that the report was 
withheld from the public because Wedemeyer, by now considered an expert on 
China, had contradicted Truman's policies. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Marshall, then secretary of state, had recommended embargoing the 
Wedemeyer report -- finally released two years later -- because it described 
the Nationalist government as "corrupt, reactionary and inefficient," so much 
so that it could not win the loyalty of the people of China. 
</P>
<P>
But Chiang's partisans in the United States chose to ignore the criticism and 
hear only Wedemeyer's call for the communists to lay down their arms. 
</P>
<P>
Controversial Report 
</P>
<P>
In 1947, Wedemeyer authored a report on China and Korea that called, among 
other things, for an American-directed, South Korean force capable of defeating 
any Soviet-supported invasion from the north. The report was considered so 
controversial that President Truman decided not to make it public. 
</P>
<P>
Wedemeyer's frustration led to his retirement in 1951. The following year he 
backed conservative Sen. Robert Taft (R-Ohio), but then supported the GOP 
ticket headed by his old friend from the war plans division, Dwight D. 
Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, he retired from business to write his book, and to take on the role of 
senior statesman. He was 59 and he had, in the words of the oblique Chinese 
curse, "lived in interesting times." 
</P>
<P>
Yet his moment had passed. Neither Eisenhower nor the much younger John F. 
Kennedy called upon Wedemeyer to serve as one of their foreign policy wise men. 
The first found him too soft, his anti-communism always tempered by practical 
realpolitik; the second found him a relic of another era. 
</P>
<P>
He would live in retirement at his farm through successive administrations, 
attending annual Bohemian Club gatherings north of San Francisco, staying in 
touch with many of the nation's most influential, but no longer himself at the 
heart of great events. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he was awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Medal of 
Freedom, by President Ronald Reagan.

TUNA BOAT DAMAGED IN PANAMA CANAL EXPLOSION; CREW UNHARMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crew members on two San Diego-based tuna boats that were docked in Panamanian 
waters escaped injury early Wednesday morning when an explosion, reportedly set 
by U.S. Navy commandos, hit a nearby Panamanian patrol boat. 
</P>
<P>
One of the tuna boats sustained damage in the 1 a.m. explosion that rocked the 
Balboa section of the Panama Canal near Panama City, said August Felando, 
president of the San Diego-based American Tunaboat Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the Samoa Star's hull was first described as "significant," said 
Felando, who talked to the crew by telephone Wednesday. However, during a 
subsequent telephone call, crew members described the damage as "nothing to be 
alarmed about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crew members on the Samoa Star and the Odette Therese, which was docked nearby, 
"are OK. . . . They feel very secure now," Felando said. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Maughan of San Diego is skipper of the Samoa Star. Anthony Virissimo, also 
of San Diego, commands the Odette Therese, Felando said. He did not know how 
many San Diegans are on the vessels, which generally carry a crew of 20. 
</P>
<P>
The crews heard "an explosion at about 1 a.m. local time on Wednesday," Felando 
said. "It was assumed that it was a Navy SEAL team that caused the explosion, 
sinking the Panamanian patrol vessel," Felando said. 
</P>
<P>
Crew members told Felando that Panamanian sailors had spent the previous two 
days "putting gun mounts on the patrol vessel." The crews did not know if 
Panamanian sailors were killed in the explosion, Felando said. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Douglas Coffey of the U.S. Special Operations Command, which oversees 
SEALs and other special combat units, acknowledged that special forces are 
operating in Panama. But he declined to comment on whether U.S. Navy SEALs were 
involved in the apparent sinking of the Panamanian boat. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any special information about damage to the tuna boat," Coffey 
said. "I have no way of knowing at this point what the circumstances are." 
</P>
<P>
The crews, who have been ordered to remain on their boats, feel "very secure" 
because U.S. soldiers are stationed nearby, Felando said. The Army has parked a 
tank next to the Samoa Star, and a Navy vessel is anchored nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The crews were "very proud of the way in which the U.S. military handled 
things," Felando said. The Samoa Star crew was "providing cakes, coffee and 
sandwiches" to military personnel, Felando said. 
</P>
<P>
The tuna boats docked in Panama several days ago for minor repairs and to take 
on supplies. A third ship, the Connie Jean, left Panama on Tuesday, Felando 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Samoa Star, owned by the Sousa family of San Diego, and the Odette Therese, 
owned by the Virissimo family, also of San Diego, are about 220 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-based tuna boats regularly travel the canal from fishing grounds in the 
Pacific to canneries in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
The last cannery in San Diego closed in 1984, and only one West Coast cannery 
-- in San Pedro -- remains in operation. "This is one of the times that 
Americans could end up missing those canneries," Felando said. 
</P>
<P>
The ships were returning to the Pacific from Puerto Rico, Felando said. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's military action closed the Panama Canal for the first time in 75 
years. Any prolonged closing of the canal could affect several San Diego-based 
boats that are now unloading their catch in Puerto Rico, Felando said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those boats "were trying to come home for the holidays," Felando said. 
They will evidently remain in Puerto Rico until they can "safely complete" 
transit through the canal, Felando said. 
</P>
<P>
Felando was unable to contact the tuna-boat skippers late Wednesday because "we 
can't call them. We're dependent upon them calling us from shore."

THINGS HATCHING AT SEA WORLD'S PENGUIN ENCOUNTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 10 degrees below freezing, the delivery room at Sea World is colder than 
most. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, however, a record-breaking number of feathered couples have 
become parents at the marine park's "Penguin Encounter," and recently the 45 
tiny hatchlings have started to get some notice. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, the glassed-in, 5,000-square-foot cold climate exhibit has begun to 
resemble a hospital infant ward, as park visitors strain to get a glimpse of 
the 14 fast-growing adelie penguins that are just beginning to venture outside 
their nests. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the the most exciting additions to the park's penguin colony are 
not yet on public display. Besides 23 more adelies, two baby gentoo penguins 
are being hand-raised by park keepers, the first gentoos to be born from eggs 
laid in captivity at Sea World. Six baby Humboldt penguins are being 
hand-raised as well, and keepers say that, by observing the young, they hope to 
learn more about preserving Humboldts, the one penguin species that is 
endangered. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a oil spill off the coast of Chile or Peru where the Humboldts 
are, that could disrupt the whole species," said Joop Kuhn, supervisor of 
aviculture at Sea World. "We'd need to know what to feed them, how often, how 
much. But we're getting a pretty good understanding -- we'd know where to 
start." 
</P>
<P>
With more than 500 penguins, the marine park's 6-year-old exhibit is the 
largest penguin colony outside of the Antarctic. As part of a project conducted 
with the National Science Foundation, the park keeps detailed records on each 
penguin from nine species. 
</P>
<P>
There's a file, for example, on King Tut, the first king penguin park keepers 
hand-raised from an egg that was laid in the wild. There's another on Elvis, 
another king penguin named for the "king of rock 'n' roll," Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Files include personal details, he said: "Who they're paired up with, how many 
offspring they've had, if they've changed mates -- for the most part, they're 
monogamous, but we've seen a slight divorce rate in our enclosure." 
</P>
<P>
Park experts know which birds have showed a knack for keeping their eggs warm, 
and which birds have wandered off to let the eggs fend for themselves. They 
know that a penguin lays two eggs, as they often do, as a kind of "insurance," 
Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most penguin species will lay two eggs 
</P>
<P>
but rarely will they be able to raise both young. It's survival of the 
fittest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But park keepers, eager to supplement their growing colony, have begun rescuing 
the second eggs from the nests before they hatch. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother Nature is very tough on her own. We try to sort of soften that by 
artificial incubating," Kuhn said. "If we take one egg from our birds, and 
leave them with one, they will put all their effort and energy there." 
</P>
<P>
The hand-raised babies are treated to what keepers call penguin milkshakes, a 
tasty mixture of herring filets, shrimp-like crustaceans, half-and-half cream, 
water and vitamins that is heated to 90 degrees to resemble the regurgitated 
meals their parents would feed them in the wild, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said the park had also hoped to hatch some chinstrap penguins this year, 
which have never been hatched in captivity. Chinstrap penguins, named for the 
black stripe across their necks, laid eggs for the first time at Sea World this 
year. But the eggs proved infertile. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year they try and do it," Kuhn said. "They do their best sitting on 
the eggs. Hopefully, by the second year, they've figured out the copulation 
thing and see if they can pull it off."

IMMEDIATE ASBESTOS TREATMENT URGED FOR NINE PUBLIC BUILDINGS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE CANCER-CAUSING AGENT WAS OUTLAWED BY FEDERAL LAW IN 1979, AND OLDER 
STRUCTURES ARE BEING TESTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
State and county asbestos studies have identified 39 county-owned buildings as 
containing the cancer-causing agent and have recommended that nine of the 
facilities be treated immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Griego, the county's deputy chief administrative officer, said, however, 
that loose asbestos fibers in the nine buildings have already been sealed. But 
lack of funds will delay the complete removal of the asbestos, Griego said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying that this is a state of emergency," Griego said. "The 
asbestos was of no concern unless it was disturbed. But conditions were worse 
in those buildings, and that's why we were directed to address them as soon as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
A state Department of Health Services survey of public buildings released 
earlier this month evaluated 22 buildings throughout the county, of which 13 
were county-owned. For eight of those buildings the study stated that the 
"conditions probably represent some health risk" and recommended immediate 
action to at least encapsulate loose asbestos fibers. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two years, the county has also been examining its buildings, 
Griego said. In addition to the 13 buildings evaluated by the state study, 
county inspectors have identified 26 others as "positively containing" 
asbestos, of which one building required prompt action. 
</P>
<P>
According to Griego, the nine buildings that need immediate attention are: 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
* The Loma Portal Mental Health Facility, 3485 Kenyon St., San Diego.

Diego. 
</P>
<P>
* An alcohol detox center, 1123 Island Ave., San Diego. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
* Camp Rancho del Rayo, Building 300, 957 Forest Gate Road, Campo.

Growing concern in recent years over the dangers of asbestos has spurred 
governments to either remove or encapsulate loose microscopic asbestos fibers 
commonly found in more than 3,000 building products such as cable insulation, 
roof shingles and fireproofing coatings or materials. The U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency estimates that more than 733,000 public and commercial 
buildings nationwide contain asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
The cancer-causing agent was outlawed in 1979 and federal law requires removal 
of asbestos before a building's renovation or demolition to prevent the release 
of asbestos fibers into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Although Griego said the county plans to remove the asbestos from the buildings 
as soon as possible, he said the encapsulated fibers pose no threat to county 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll deal with the buildings on a one-by-one basis when it comes time to 
renovate or work on them," Griego said. "That's the only time when asbestos 
becomes dangerous. The whole hazard with asbestos is when the fibers get loose 
and float in the air." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Griego said, most of the asbestos found in the nine buildings was 
discovered in areas typically inaccessible to workers or visitors such as 
basements and cellars. 
</P>
<P>
The county General Services Department already has spent the $350,000 allocated 
for asbestos removal this year, Griego said. The bulk of the funds was spent on 
consulting services to help inspect buildings, to train staff and to purchase 
special equipment. And renovations at the downtown courthouse and the Juvenile 
Court building also required spending money to remove asbestos from certain 
sections of those facilities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Griego said the county has not determined how much it will cost to remove the 
asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody can tell you how much this is going to cost," Griego 
said. "That will depend on each building and the removal technique used to get 
rid of the asbestos. In some cases, I'm afraid it will become quite expensive." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the county, as well as other local governments, are increasingly 
taking asbestos manufacturers to court to win damages to help defray the cost 
of the expensive removal process. 
</P>
<P>
In September, San Diego County sued 13 building manufacturers whose 
asbestos-containing products were used anywhere from 15 to 30 years ago in the 
county courthouse and its adjoining jail. The lawsuit, authorized by the county 
Board of Supervisors, seeks to recover the expense of removing asbestos 
discovered in the county buildings. The suit targets only the asbestos found in 
the downtown courthouse and its adjoining jail. The city of San Diego has also 
filed a similar suit for asbestos found in eight buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, such lawsuits allege that the asbestos manufacturers either knew 
or should have known of the health hazards associated with the material before 
selling it to prospective buyers.

COUNTY TO PROVIDE 10-ACRE SITE FOR ABUSED-CHILDREN CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors agreed Wednesday to provide a 10-acre, 
county-owned Kearny Mesa site to a private group to build a $15-million center 
to care for abused children. 
</P>
<P>
The staggering rise in child abuse in recent years spurred the five supervisors 
to unanimously support a public/private partnership proposed by the nonprofit 
Child Abuse Prevention Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Under the joint venture, the foundation will raise funds for the center's 
construction. But, once built, the center will be turned over to the county, 
which will then own and operate it. 
</P>
<P>
If the foundation can't raise the initial $15 million, however, the project 
could be scrubbed. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Vanica, the foundation's executive director, said the proposed 130-bed 
center will provide emergency shelter, counseling and prevention services. Fund 
raising will start soon, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next two to three months, the foundation and the county's department 
of social services will determine the specific services the center will 
provide, its design and its operating costs. Though plans are still sketchy, 
Vanica hopes to have the new center in partial operation by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"Very seldom does the private sector come to us and say they'd like to build 
something for us," Supervisor Susan Golding said. "We have to take advantage of 
such opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"This center will be able to care for those children who are afraid and 
fearful," she said. "It will allow them to become normal, healthy, functioning 
children of our society, and it gives their parents a chance, too. It can help 
educate parents who may not know how to take care of their children." 
</P>
<P>
Foundation statistics show that the number of referrals to the county's child 
protective services department escalated to 45,800 cases in 1987 from 11,500 in 
1982 -- a 300% increase. Although growing public awareness and increased 
attempts to fight child abuse account for much of the increase, Vanica said the 
rise in drug use, population growth and poverty also contribute to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Leon Williams said he recognizes the need for a comprehensive care 
center, but said he is concerned about the county's ability to maintain and 
operate it once completed. 
</P>
<P>
But the center's supporters said the foundation plans to establish a $3-million 
endowment and sponsor continuing fund-raisers to help pay for operational 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Norman Hickey, the county's chief administrative officer, said the 
bulk of operating costs for such centers is provided by state and federal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The annual operating cost of the 20-bed Hillcrest Receiving Home, the county's 
sole existing shelter, is $1.78 million, but the county pays only 10% of that. 
When completed, the center will replace the Hillcrest facility, Hickey added.

RUBBER DUCKIE PLEA FAILS TO SWAY COUNCIL TO LET TAME BIRDS IN POND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manhattan Beach City Councilwoman Pat Collins populated her corner of the City 
Council dais with ducks Tuesday evening. They were a fanciful, toy flock she 
brought in a shopping bag. 
</P>
<P>
A large duck doll wore a dress of appropriate holiday red. Another came as a 
candy dish, and there was even a yellow rubber duckie. 
</P>
<P>
The toys were the councilwoman's silent supporters as she tried to persuade her 
colleagues to again permit some white domestic ducks at the Polliwog Park pond, 
which is undergoing a thorough cleaning and rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to maintain the spirit of children feeding the ducks and of people who 
want to go down to ponder and see the ducks," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
But while the rest of the council found Collins' ploy amusing, no one backed 
her proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the council approved a new Polliwog pond animal policy aimed at 
returning the park to what it was intended to be -- a habitat for migratory 
water fowl passing by on the Southern California flyway. 
</P>
<P>
Only migratory and transient wildlife may take up residence under the new 
rules, and nature talks and tours on the park's ecosystem and animal life will 
be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bob Holmes said it was the overpopulation of domestic ducks -- and 
their prolific production of excrement -- that polluted the pond and made 
reconstruction necessary. Collins, however, said she wasn't talking about 60 or 
80 ducks, but maybe a dozen. 
</P>
<P>
Collins' call for some domestic animals at the pond stems from September's 
furor over the killing of 83 ducks and geese by Los Angeles County animal 
control officers. The birds had to be removed so the pond could be rebuilt, and 
there was concern that they could carry diseases from the buildup of bacteria 
in the pond, city officials said. Three escaped the killing and were rounded up 
later. They are now kept in a pen at the city maintenance yard. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling the furor in September, Collins said, "We had duck fever and I was 
the mayor who received the duck letters from children" saddened by the deaths 
of their feathered friends. 
</P>
<P>
Collins contended the city gave its implied commitment to return some domestic 
ducks to the pond, but city staff members said there were no guarantees and the 
council later called for development of an animal policy. 
</P>
<P>
Once a part of the natural marsh system that stretched from the harbor area to 
Marina del Rey, the pond became a major feature of the 18.5-acre park that 
opened in 1976 at Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Redondo Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The city envisioned it as a stopping off point for migratory waterfowl, such as 
ducks, geese, herons and egrets. Jim Stecklein, city parks and recreation 
director, said it was intended to provide an inland water experience for 
children and other park visitors. 
</P>
<P>
But within a few years, domestic white ducks began appearing, presumably dumped 
by people getting rid of noisy pets. They, in turn, multiplied, sometimes 
breeding with the wild birds. Stecklein said that at times, there were as many 
as 200 ducks at the pond. 
</P>
<P>
The newly adopted policy prohibits feeding or abandoning animals at the park, 
neither of which has been illegal before. One of the council's arguments 
against Collins' proposal is that a few domestic ducks will encourage the 
abandonment of more. "They'll prime the pump," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Stecklein concedes that some dumping probably will still occur because the park 
is not fenced. The policy, however, provides for immediate removal of any 
domestic animals, which would be relocated to several designated places, 
including Los Angeles city and county parks and Harbor Lake in Harbor City. Any 
domestic waterfowl eggs found in regular inspections of the park will also go. 
</P>
<P>
The $426,000 pond rehabilitation program, expected to be completed shortly 
after Christmas, has included dredging and removal of accumulated material on 
the bottom of the pond, installation of a cement bottom and border around the 
pond, and relandscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Stecklein said the old pond had a clay bottom that could not be cleaned, unlike 
the new cement bottom. 
</P>
<P>
The city Parks and Recreation Commission held two public forums in connection 
with development of the animal policy. Both were poorly attended, which 
officials found surprising because of the outcry over killing the ducks in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Stecklein said, however, that those who spoke overwhelmingly favored making 
Polliwog a natural habitat, rejecting an alternate proposal to mix wild and 
domestic birds. The commission also recommended the policy the council adopted. 
</P>
<P>
While rejecting Collins' plea on behalf of the familiar white quackers, the 
council held the door open for another look in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Said Holmes: "I'm not proposing we have a sterile park. If it doesn't become a 
Motel 6 for migratory birds, then we can throw in some domestics."

BOTH SIDES AGREE -- THEY DISLIKE GROWTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Homeowners and studio executives alike said Wednesday they are dissatisfied 
with the Burbank City Council's recommendations for growth controls in the 
city's Media District, the most controversial of which is a 15-story height 
limit on construction. 
</P>
<P>
The council's recommendations will be used to revise a proposed Media District 
Specific Plan that, when completed, will guide development of the 
1.2-square-mile area in the southwest corner of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Some homeowners complained Wednesday that the proposed restrictions do not go 
far enough in protecting their neighborhoods, which they say are already 
overrun with traffic, noise and pollution caused by overdevelopment. But film 
studio executives maintain that their operations are important to the city's 
economic future and that they should be given more flexibility to expand. 
</P>
<P>
"A 15-story building is still a high-rise," said Michael Scandiffio, a member 
of the Burbank Rancho Homeowners. "The City Council is trying to force 
something down our throats that we don't want." 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Berlin, a member of the Verdugo-Magnolia Homeowners Assn., also was 
disappointed with the council's proposed height restriction. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel they have no regard for people who live here," Berlin said. "It's like 
we should all move out so they can develop the entire city." 
</P>
<P>
Jack O'Neill, vice president of real estate for NBC, said the height 
restriction is the studio's main concern. NBC, in partnership with Cushman 
Investment and Development Corp., has proposed constructing a 21-story tower 
and a 17-story tower on a triangular parcel bounded by Olive Avenue, California 
Street and the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to come down to 20 stories," O'Neill said. "I know that there 
are going to have to be compromises made, but I would hope that they will not 
be so severe as to not allow the project to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
He said the five-story limit sought by the homeowners was unreasonable. "There 
has to be a midpoint somewhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Council members said they would favor allowing media-related businesses 
flexibility on the 15-story height limit. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the council also agreed that the major studios in the district 
should not have to apply for a conditional-use permit -- a lengthy process that 
requires a public hearing -- for buildings up to 125 feet tall. Such buildings 
would be between 10 and 12 stories. 
</P>
<P>
The council recommended other restrictions, including requiring buildings of 
between 25 and 50 feet to be at least 25 feet away from residential 
neighborhoods. Buildings of between 50 and 150 feet high would be required to 
be at least 35 feet away from such a neighborhood, under the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Developers, however, could apply for conditional-use permits for projects that 
exceeded the recommended limits if they thought the projects warranted further 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition, Councilman Thomas E. Flavin defended the council's 
recommendations. "I thought the council made an honest effort to balance the 
differing viewpoints on both sides," Flavin said. "Of course, not everyone is 
going to be 100% satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Flavin said further modifications might be necessary before a final 
growth-control plan for the Media District is drafted. After the plan is 
revised, an environmental impact report will be prepared and more public 
hearings scheduled.

<P>
President Bush's decision to invade Panama prompted support from two Democratic 
and three Republican congressmen from the San Fernando Valley area Wednesday 
but drew criticism from Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we have the right to remove foreign governments we don't like, 
and I don't think the rationales the President gave are terribly convincing, 
nor are they terribly different from the rationales that could have been given 
a month ago," said Beilenson, who wields foreign policy clout as head of the 
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, liberal Democratic Reps. Howard L. Berman of Panorama City and 
Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles applauded Bush for moving against Panamanian 
Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, who has been indicted in the United States on drug 
charges. They were joined by GOP Reps. Elton Gallegly of Simi Valley, Carlos J. 
Moorhead of Glendale and William M. Thomas of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
The initial response among Valley-area lawmakers mirrored national 
congressional reaction; Beilenson was one of the very few representatives to 
voice opposition to Bush's action. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is ever a case for an American military intervention of this kind, 
this was the case," said Berman, a House Foreign Affairs Committee member. 
"We're dealing with a dictator who stole an election, who had been indicted for 
violating U.S. laws, who had taken actions which were on the verge of 
destroying the economic viability of his own people. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, more American and Panamanian lives would have been in 
jeopardy from letting the situation continue than the actual casualties we are 
taking and foisting on the Panamanian people by the intervention." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly, who also sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee and visited Panama 
recently, said of Noriega: 
</P>
<P>
"By declaring Panama in a state of war with the United States and by the 
unprovoked murder of an American Marine and the assaults on several other 
Americans during the past few days, it was clear that U.S. lives were in 
danger. In addition, there are reports that Noriega had threatened the Panama 
Canal." Thomas, whose 20th District includes the northern Antelope Valley, said 
Noriega "is getting what he asked for." Added Moorhead, "I don't think that 
Bush had any choice." 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson, who joins other congressional leaders for regular foreign policy 
meetings with Bush and top administrative aides, learned of the military action 
at 1:45 a.m. when CIA Director William H. Webster called him. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me what he knew at the time," Beilenson recalled. "That the troops had 
already gone in and, from scattered earlier reports, things seemed to be going 
well." 
</P>
<P>
However loathsome Noriega may be, Beilenson said, he is not unique among the 
world's dictators. The veteran lawmaker added that the situation in Panama had 
changed only modestly in recent days and that both Noriega's indictment and his 
theft of the Panamanian election had occurred some time ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were clear that there was an all-out assault on American personnel that 
was ordered or led by the government and the American armed forces already down 
there could not properly defend themselves, then the President has a duty to 
send in forces to protect those personnel," said Beilenson, who was also 
critical of former President Reagan's decisions to invade Grenada and bomb 
Libya. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's the situation we were faced with." 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson has generally praised Bush's foreign policy, including the 
President's decision not to assist in the failed coup against Noriega in 
October. The legislator said criticism of the Administration's inaction at that 
time sowed the seeds for Wednesday's invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"They were probably looking for, or alert to, an opportunity should one arise," 
he said. "Plus the fact that it's a Grenada-like operation or it's hoped to 
be," meaning that it will not last long or cost many American lives and will be 
politically popular, even in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Berman agreed that there was "a great deal of clamor on the Hill for more 
decisive action sooner." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he added: "The action is significantly less than a total success 
if we can't bring Noriega to justice and if he retains an ability to control 
military forces in Panama that allows this to continue."

REVERSAL OF RAPE AWARD PROTESTED; 
</P>
<P>
DISABLED: A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE FINDS PROTESTERS AT HIS HOUSE. COURT OFFICIALS 
AND SOME HANDICAPPED ACTIVISTS CONDEMN THE RALLY. 
</P>

<P>
Activists for the disabled demonstrated Wednesday at the Canoga Park house of a 
San Fernando Superior Court judge who reversed a jury verdict awarding $7.5 
million to a paralyzed woman raped in a North Hollywood nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was condemned by court officials and some other disabled 
activists, who criticized the demonstrators for endangering the judge in a week 
when a federal judge was killed by a mail bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying signs bearing slogans such as "Judge: what if it was your daughter?" 
and "We treat the dead better," 22 members of American Disabled for Accessible 
Public Transportation (ADAPT) held a candlelight vigil at the house of Judge 
David M. Schacter. 
</P>
<P>
They were protesting Schacter's decision in October to reverse a jury verdict 
in the case of Andrea Nerpel, 39, who was raped at the Laurelwood Nursing Home 
in 1982. Schacter set aside the award, ruling there was insufficient evidence 
to support contentions that negligence by the nursing home staff led to 
Nerpel's rape. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters said Wednesday the case reflects society's mistreatment of the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to express our outrage that a judge could ignore the rights of a 
disabled person," said Lillybeth Navarro-Persina, president of the group's 
Southern California chapter. 
</P>
<P>
But court officials and other disabled activists said the protesters were 
misguided and their tactics inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't read the ruling," said Superior Court spokeswoman Rebecca Kuzins. 
"Her attorney had to prove that the nursing home was negligent. He didn't do 
that and that's why Schacter could not award the damages. It has to do with the 
failure of the plaintiff's attorney, who failed to make the case." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Richard P. Byrne, presiding judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, 
criticized the organization's members for publicizing Schacter's address in the 
wake of the killing of a federal judge in Alabama and the discovery of a bomb 
in a courthouse in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"The publication of a judge's home address and phone number would be 
irresponsible at any time, but it is deplorable now," Byrne said. "Recent 
events clearly indicate that judges' concern for security is not an idle fear 
but a grave reality." 
</P>
<P>
Schacter, who received several threatening letters after his decision was 
announced, moved his wife and daughter from the house earlier in the day after 
police warned him about plans for the protest. 
</P>
<P>
Rock singer and disabled activist Dorik Perman criticized the demonstration, 
saying it was inappropriate to carry the dispute to the judge's house. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a beef against the system, go to the courthouse. Don't go to his 
house and start harassing him," said Perman, a founding member of another 
disabled rights group called Access Hollywood. "They are going on emotion." 
</P>
<P>
Nerpel, who was left semi-paralyzed and unable to communicate when she suffered 
major brain damage in an automobile accident in 1969, was made pregnant by a 
rapist in 1982. After Nerpel underwent an abortion and was sterilized, her 
family sued the nursing home for damages. 
</P>
<P>
In overturning the verdict, Schacter chastised Nerpel's attorney, Alan J. 
Schultz, for failing to introduce facts to support his contention that the 
nursing home was negligent and that Nerpel had suffered damages from the rape. 
</P>
<P>
But the protesters Wednesday said the facts speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"The mere fact that she got pregnant is evidence that they were negligent," 
said Barbara Faye Waxman, who is confined to a wheelchair and requires a 
respirator to compensate for muscular weakness.

WESTLAKE VILLAGE BANS MENORAH IN CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Jewish center's request to display a Hanukkah menorah next to the Westlake 
Village City Hall Christmas tree has been denied by officials who said the 
eight-day celebration is not a national holiday and that it lacks the secular 
appeal of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Larry Bagley, who rejected a request made earlier this month to 
display the menorah, also said the City Hall reception area was too small to 
accommodate decorations for cultural holidays not endorsed by the state or 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The decision has ignited fears of anti-Semitism among Jews and prompted dozens 
of concerned telephone calls to Chabad of the Conejo, a community group with 
synagogues and cultural centers in Westlake Village and Agoura Hills, associate 
director Rabbi Yitzchak Sapochkinsky said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sapochkinsky said he did not think the city's motives were anti-Semitic, 
although he called the decision by Bagley "a shameful thing." 
</P>
<P>
Bagley said he knew of the U.S. Supreme Court decision last July that a 
menorah, like a Christmas tree, is a secular symbol and therefore could be 
publicly displayed without violating constitutional bans on governmental 
endorsement of religions. But Bagley said the decision simply allowed -- but 
did not require -- that menorahs be displayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want anybody of any particular cultural group to feel we weren't 
concerned or didn't have good thoughts for their religious or cultural 
symbols," Bagley said. 
</P>
<P>
Sapochkinsky estimated that several thousand Jews live in the Conejo Valley, 
mostly in Thousand Oaks and Agoura Hills. Both of those cities approved Chabad 
center requests for permission to display a menorah, and the Thousand Oaks City 
Council last week held a menorah-lighting ceremony at the start of its regular 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Village Mayor Bonnie Klove said the council would not reconsider 
Bagley's decision before the start of the eight-day Hanukkah celebration 
tomorrow night. She said that while a Christmas tree is a secular symbol, a 
menorah is a religious symbol. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Ken Rufener agreed in a Dec. 11 letter to Rabbi Moshe Bryski, 
Chabad's regional director. "Christmas is a festive season shared by people of 
all religions and ethnic backgrounds," Rufener wrote. "Surely you are aware 
that Jewish families in our community, as well as Christian families, give and 
attend Christmas parties."

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED IN DEATH OF BYSTANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 38-year-old North Hollywood man who fatally shot a bystander while trying to 
kill his ex-girlfriend was sentenced Wednesday to 26 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Osorio was convicted in October of second-degree murder and attempted 
murder for killing Ralph Guillen, 34, with shots intended for Yolanda Gallegos, 
who had spurned him several months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 19, 1988, Osorio went to the bar where Gallegos worked and fired a 
.38-caliber automatic pistol at her, but hit Guillen instead. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Jerold M. Schultz argued that Osorio should be convicted 
of manslaughter, not murder, because he did not mean to kill Guillen. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Guadalupe Y. Gonzalez read a plea from Guillen's widow and 
four young children, who said they still require psychiatric counseling and 
asked that Osorio receive the maximum sentence of 26 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez also pleaded for the maximum sentence, saying Guillen was born on 
Christmas Day and dressed up as Santa Claus each year to distribute gifts to 
his family, who now celebrate the holiday at his graveside.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 MEN ARRESTED IN RIDE-BY PURSE THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police were gathering evidence Wednesday from more than 50 ride-by 
purse snatchings in the San Fernando Valley since September that were believed 
to have been the work of two men arrested this week, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe the arrests of Ronald Clark, 24, and Curtis Brooks, 
26, both of Reseda, brought to an end a string of similar incidents in which 
women were robbed while walking through shopping center parking lots, primarily 
in the West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were arrested Monday night following three days of surveillance by 
a team of detectives in cars and on motorcycles, said Sgt. Paul Mattson. The 
surveillance was begun after an off-duty police officer familiar with the 
string of purse snatchings by two men on a motorcycle spotted them Friday in 
the West Valley and followed them to their apartment in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Mattson said that on Monday evening the two men went out on the motorcycle and 
rode through the parking lots of several shopping areas in the Valley. About 6 
p.m. they rode up behind a woman in Lucky Market parking lot in the 22800 block 
of Victory Boulevard and stole her purse. She was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were followed to their apartment and arrested without incident, 
Mattson said.

A car apparently traveling at an unsafe speed rolled over on Sierra Highway in 
Agua Dulce Wednesday, killing the 35-year-old driver, the California Highway 
Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The name of the dead man, a Saugus resident, was withheld until his relatives 
could be notified. The man was thrown from the car when it went out of control 
shortly after 5 p.m. on the southbound side of the highway, about three miles 
east of Agua Dulce Canyon Road, Officer David Moeller said. No one else was

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED IN RAPE, ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 22-year-old Van Nuys man who raped a woman at knifepoint in front of her 
6-year-old son and later attempted to kidnap a convenience store clerk was 
sentenced Wednesday to 24 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Morris pleaded guilty on Nov. 20 to three counts of rape and one count 
each of forcible oral copulation, assault with a deadly weapon, burglary, 
kidnaping and robbery in exchange for the 24-year sentence. He could have 
received nearly double that sentence if convicted on all the charges, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth A. Loveman. Morris ordered the 20-year-old victim to 
bring her son into the room before raping her twice and forcing her to orally 
copulate him in Van Nuys on July 26, 1987. He raped her again outside the boy's 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Morris went into a 7-Eleven store on Victory Boulevard in Van 
Nuys and robbed it of a small amount of cash. He forced clerk Rose Romero, 32, 
of North Hollywood, into the parking lot by pretending to hold a gun to her 
back, Loveman said. 
</P>
<P>
Romero pretended to faint, attracting the attention of passers-by, and Morris 
fled. He was later identified by Romero and another clerk and by the rape 
victim.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'PERMANENT MAKEUP' MADE LEGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Permanent makeup" artists will be allowed to take up their tattooing needles 
again under a new law adopted Tuesday by the Torrance City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency ordinance, approved 6-0 with Councilman Bill Applegate absent, 
exempts only doctors and licensed cosmetologists and electrologists from a 1959 
city ordinance that bans tattooing within city limits. The ban on all other 
forms of tattooing remains in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Permanent makeup is applied with extremely fine needles that are used to slip 
color into the skin beneath eyebrows, around lips and along the eyelash line. 
The procedure is not regulated by any government agency. 
</P>
<P>
In October, city staff members ordered three beauty salons to stop offering the 
service after a permanent makeup artist seeking a business license brought in 
the salons' advertisements to show that the procedure was already being done in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Electrologist Irene Hatate asked City Council members to change the 
anti-tattooing law to allow her to continue the service, which she said 
provides half her income. 
</P>
<P>
Under the emergency ordinance, Hatate was allowed to begin work immediately but 
did not have a client scheduled until today.

SO MANY QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Removing Gen. Manuel Noriega from power is something everyone can applaud. And 
-- let's face it -- if U.S. forces could have gone in and spirited him out to 
stand trial here on drug charges in one swift, deft and decisive stroke, the 
inevitable second-guessing about desirability and legality would be over with, 
in all probability, with comparative celerity. Noriega declared war on the 
United States first, after all, and he's such a villainous figure that few will 
shed any tears over his being chased from power. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact is that our forces are still in Panama, and Noriega is still at 
large. This means that even though most Americans support President Bush's 
action, we are left wondering whether the conception and execution were as 
irreproachable as the intent. In his address to the nation Wednesday, President 
Bush said, "No president takes such action lightly." Well, the American people 
regard this as a very serious matter, too. So do our friends in Latin America, 
where memories of past U.S. interventions are so vivid that many of them 
immediately condemned the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
That's why numerous and troubling questions about the U.S. action against 
Noriega's hateful regime must be asked. Clearly it's a good thing Noriega is 
out. Panamanians overwhelmingly voted in May for a presidential candidate, 
Guillermo Endara, who pledged to remove Noriega as commander of the Panama 
Defense Forces. The general used that powerful post to run Panama behind the 
scenes and to oversee his drug trafficking and other illicit activities. 
Noriega showed how much power he could wield, and how brutally, when he 
prevented Endara from taking office, letting his thugs publicly beat Endara and 
one of his vice presidents, Guillermo Ford. 
</P>
<P>
But while it's clear Noriega had to go, it's less certain that force was the 
only way to remove him. And if it was the only option, why did the United 
States have to act on its own? And, if a Lone Ranger intervention was the only 
way, why was U.S. intelligence unable to pinpoint his whereabouts to facilitate 
early capture? President Bush says he had to protect 35,000 U.S. citizens 
living in Panama from "imminent danger." But were things in Panama really more 
dangerous now than at any other time in the 2-year standoff with Noriega? Or 
did Bush find the series of recent violent incidents involving U.S. citizens in 
Panama -- including the shooting death of a Marine Corps officer and the 
brutalizing of another officer and his wife -- a useful pretext to take actions 
they had been planning for some time? And why was this action taken now, just 
when it appeared that the campaign of economic and diplomatic pressure against 
Noriega was beginning to have some effect? 
</P>
<P>
Other questions that have yet to be adequately answered: How well did this 
operation go in strictly military and political terms? Elements of the PDF are 
still offering resistance, despite claims that U.S. troops are now mopping up. 
Conversely, if the PDF completely collapses, who will enforce the authority of 
Panama's new civilian government? U.S. troops may wind up staying in Panama 
longer than Pentagon planners realize just to serve as policemen. How will the 
Panamanian people react to the invasion? Many undoubtedly feel relief that 
Noriega has been ousted. But how many will be angry or distraught over the 
blood it cost? 
</P>
<P>
What will the effect of this action be on the future of democracy in Panama? 
Another goal of the invasion, according to Bush, was to "restore democracy," 
and many members of Congress who rushed to the President's support agreed with 
that goal. But, in truth, Panama has never been a real democracy; for almost 20 
years it has been under the control of military dictators who ruled at least 
partly because they were on good terms with Washington. For a long time, one of 
them was Noriega, who got on very well with the Reagan Administration until his 
drug trafficking became too much for it to overlook. The United States helped 
create the monster it is now trying to destroy, and the invasion may set back 
genuine democracy in Panama for many more years. And Latins remember well the 
dozens of major and minor U.S. interventions in Mexico, Central America and the 
Caribbean far better than most Americans do, which is why they were reluctant 
to encourage U.S. military action against Noriega, no matter how much they 
detested him. 
</P>
<P>
And what will the impact of this action be on the future of the Panama Canal 
treaties? In his speech Bush pointedly emphasized that he is fully committed to 
implementing them, and turning the canal over to Panama in the year 2000, as 
they require. That is an important stance, and one the government must stand by 
even if some jingoists now start calling for continued U.S. control of the 
Canal Zone. The canal is a symbol to Panamanians, and other Latin Americans, of 
what many call "American imperialism." While it was controversial in this 
country, President Carter's decision to give up the canal was the wisest step 
ever taken by a U.S. President to show that the era of gunboat diplomacy was 
ending and that the United States is prepared to treat its neighbors with the 
respect and dignity they want.

ECOLOGY SURVEY: AT THE CROSSROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the Crossroads was a very well-written and researched summary of the 
environmental problems which ail Southern California and of the hard choices we 
will face in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, a glaring omission in the discussion of the causes and proposed 
solutions was made. Nowhere it was mentioned that the rapid local immigration 
and population growth are among the underlying causes of the disruption of 
Southern California's environment, and so population control must figure high 
in the solution list of our problems. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow the press can openly debate the old communist taboos. Will The Times 
be able to do the same with the obsolete cliches of unbridled immigration and 
population growth?

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY QUESTIONS MIRALESTE REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A draft environmental impact report on the closing of Miraleste High School 
fails to adequately address potential traffic, air pollution and other problems 
that could affect Rancho Palos Verdes, according to a letter drafted by the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members voted Tuesday to send the letter to the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula Unified School District as a formal response to the report, which is 
being prepared by the district under a court order. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the city did not take a position on the closure of the east-side 
high school. The district voted in November, 1987, to shut the school because 
of declining enrollment, but a parents group sued to stop the closure and the 
school remains open. 
</P>
<P>
The city's letter says more attention should be given to the effect the school 
closure would have on traffic. It says the report should suggest mitigation 
measures such as upgrading intersections or adding parking facilities at the 
district's two other high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The letter also says the report should address the issue of redeveloping the 
Miraleste property if the school is closed. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have said all comments on the report are being forwarded to 
the consultant hired to prepare it. A final report is to be completed by late 
February.

GOOD-NEIGHBOR POLICY OR JUST PLAIN MADNESS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
 From George F. Will's syndicated column . 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This intervention is a good-neighbor policy. America's role in Panama -- in 
effect, administering a recount on last May's elections -- is an act of 
hemispheric hygiene and it comes at a propitious moment. It punctuates a decade 
of recovery of national purposefulness and a year of militant democracy. 
</P>
<P>
A constant of America's national character, and a component of American 
patriotism, has been a messianic impulse -- sometimes mild, sometimes not. It 
rises from the belief that national identity is bound up with acceptance of a 
responsibility to further democracy. 
</P>
<P>
By stressing, among the reasons for intervention, the restoration of democracy, 
the President put himself squarely in a tradition with a distinguished 
pedigree. It holds that America's fundamental national interest is to be 
America, and the nation's identity is inseparable from a commitment to the 
civilized advancement of the proposition to which we, unique among nations, 
are, as the greatest American said, dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
That is why, although the President's reasons for the invasion are sufficient 
to justify it, the first reason he gave is the one that explains it: It was an 
act of neighborliness.

FORAY FOR PANAMA'S DEMOCRACY WOUNDS CONSTITUTION HERE; 
</P>
<P>
PANAMA: ONLY CONGRESS HAS THE POWER 'TO DECLARE WAR.' BUT MOST MEMBERS WEREN'T 
EVEN INFORMED UNTIL THE ACTION HAD BEGUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW ROTHSCHILD, Matthew Rothschild is managing editor of The Progressive 
magazine in Madison, Wis. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration's invasion of Panama on Wednesday morning was illegal, 
unwarranted and cynical. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the applause from Democrats and Republicans alike, some basic facts 
need to be remembered. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has a Constitution, and that Constitution gives Congress the 
sole power "to declare war" and "make rules concerning captures on land and 
water." Congress did not declare war against Panama -- most members weren't 
even informed until after the invasion had begun. 
</P>
<P>
As a justification for the invasion, Bush cited Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's 
declaration that "a state of war" exists between Panama and the United States. 
But Bush himself declined to ask Congress to declare war; he just went ahead 
and invaded on his own. This is not how our constitutional system was designed 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said another reason for the invasion -- and it was an invasion, despite 
the euphemisms floating around Washington -- was the "imminent danger to 35,000 
American citizens" in Panama. This was hardly demonstrated by the facts. A U.S. 
Marine was killed over the weekend by Panamanian forces, but the official U.S. 
version of the incident is dubious. The Marine, the Administration said, was 
unarmed and somehow got lost near Panamanian military headquarters. The 
Panamanians said the Marine, with three other American officers, was armed and 
had opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, that particular incident does not demonstrate that 35,000 
Americans are in "imminent danger." But it gave the Administration a pretext 
for an invasion that had been planned for at least three months, as CIA 
Director William H. Webster acknowledged in a conversation with Rep. Henry J. 
Hyde (R-Ill.). (Eager to come up with a better rationale, Bush later added that 
the Administration had received an unidentified and unconfirmed intelligence 
report alleging that Noriega was considering launching an urban commando 
assault on American citizens in Panama.) 
</P>
<P>
Bush also claimed that he wanted to "protect the integrity of the Panama Canal 
Treaty" when, in fact, he wanted to subvert it. Under the treaty, Panama is to 
appoint the canal commissioner, but the appointment has previously been made by 
Washington. Bush clearly did not want Noriega to be able to install someone 
hostile to the United States, so he circumvented the problem by getting rid of 
Noriega. You can bet the new president of Panama will appoint a commissioner 
more to Washington's liking. 
</P>
<P>
Hypocrisy rules the Bush Administration. While it condemns Noriega's 
dictatorship, it cozies up to the dictators in China who killed thousand of 
students in Beijing's Tian An Men Square in June. Why the double standard? 
</P>
<P>
Noriega is no saint. But there is no lack of unsavory governments in the world. 
Does the United States have a right to invade them all? Who conferred that 
right on our government? 
</P>
<P>
The obsession with Noriega is particularly ironic, because he carried 
Washington's water for 30 years. He was paid by the CIA -- during the time that 
George Bush was its director -- to finger leftists in Central America. One U.S. 
Administration after another winked at his excesses. But when Noriega was no 
longer needed, it became politically expedient for the U.S. government to 
overthrow him. 
</P>
<P>
For Bush, as for Ronald Reagan before him, Noriega represented an easy target, 
a foreign devil to oppose forcefully and thus score domestic political points. 
Bush's political need for a foreign-policy triumph has been especially acute 
because critics have branded him timid. The invasion was his answer, a handy 
way to flex his muscles. 
</P>
<P>
While this is Bush's blunder, it is also the Democrats'. They allowed the 
Administration to dilute the ban against assassinating foreign leaders, they 
banged the drums for intervention, they permitted Bush to bypass constitutional 
channels and they supported him after the fact. Within hours of the invasion, 
Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) was on television pledging Democratic support 
for the President. 
</P>
<P>
Most Democrats share the blame for this illegal invasion, which has needlessly 
cost the lives of American soldiers and Panamanian civilians. And it has 
exacted a greater toll, for it has struck another blow against democratic, 
constitutional government in the United States.

DEFENSIBLE, BUT ONLY TO A DEGREE; 
</P>
<P>
PANAMA: NORIEGA'S STATE OF WAR COULD NOT BE TOLERATED VERY LONG IF THE CANAL'S 
NEUTRALITY WERE TRULY TO BE PROTECTED. STILL, THE LEGAL CASE IS FAR FROM SOUND.

There will be much hand-wringing in the coming days over the legality of the 
United States, intervention in Panama. The legal gymnastics once again will 
frustrate those who, for example, wanted international lawyers to shut up 
during the Grenada invasion in 1983. But there is every reason to weigh the 
political expediency of such actions against the legal defenses erected by 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
Four justifications have been offered by the Bush Administration to legitimize 
this extraordinary operation. They are: to protect American lives, to defend 
democracy in Panama, to apprehend the indicted drug trafficker Manuel A. 
Noriega and to protect the integrity of the Panama Canal Treaty. Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III described the action as fully in accord with 
international law. He stressed the inherent right of self-defense under the 
United Nations Charter. 
</P>
<P>
The facts of the Panama action are still too sketchy to reach any definitive 
opinions, but it appears even at this early stage that none of these 
justifications are free of criticism under international law. 
</P>
<P>
The first justification, to defend American lives, is premised on hundreds of 
cases of harassment during the last two years, the murder of a U.S. Marine over 
the weekend, and an intelligence report about a planned urban commando attack 
on U.S. citizens. As threatening as these actions are, the Administration will 
be hard- pressed to prove that a full-scale invasion of Panama and the 
installation of a new government there were essential for the defense of 
American lives. Other alternatives short of invasion (such as evacuating all 
Americans to U.S. bases) could have been more proportional responses to the 
threats posed by Noriega's soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The second justification, to defend democracy in Panama, has enormous popular 
appeal and moral legitimacy. But most international law scholars agree that the 
U.N. Charter does not endorse the unilateral use of military force to install 
democracy any more than it does to promote other forms of government. Perhaps 
someday operations to promote democracy will be launched with the approval of 
relevant multilateral bodies, but that day has not yet arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of Noriega, which frames the third justification, is premised on an 
undisclosed set of legal claims. The Office of Legal Counsel of the Justice 
Department has issued three opinions this year that attempt to establish the 
legality of seizing Noriega or taking actions that might lead to his death. 
These opinions remain classified and therefore are shielded from the critical 
scrutiny of legal scholars. 
</P>
<P>
We can glean, though, from press accounts and congressional testimony, that the 
Justice Department is reaching its opinions on the basis of what might be 
possible under narrow readings of federal law, but unacceptable under 
international law. Until these opinions are released to the public (as were 
similar opinions from the Office of Legal Counsel during the Iran-Contra 
investigations), the Administration's justification will ring hollow for 
international lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The final justification may offer the best case under international law. The 
United States exercises a panoply of rights and obligations in Panama as an 
operator and guarantor of the security of the Panama Canal. The U.S. Southern 
Command in Panama is authorized to use military force to meet the danger 
resulting from an armed attack or other actions that threaten the security of 
the canal. U.S. forces also are authorized to guarantee the security of 
themselves, their dependents and their civilian components. If the canal's 
operations are interfered with, the United States can use military force to 
reopen the canal or restore its operations. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Panama's National Assembly, hand-picked by Noriega, approved a 
resolution stating: "The Republic of Panama is declared to be in a state of war 
while the aggression (of U.S. economic sanctions) lasts." The Panama Canal 
Treaty prohibits Panama from adopting or enforcing any law or decree or taking 
any action that purports to interfere with the exercise by the United States of 
its rights under the treaty or related agreements. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of provisions in the Panama Canal treaties that prohibit any 
American intervention in the internal affairs of Panama or any action against 
the territorial integrity or political independence of Panama. But other 
provisions stress the neutrality of the Panama Canal and the obligation of each 
party to ensure that neutrality. Noriega's state of war could not be tolerated 
very long if the canal's neutrality were truly to be protected. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the treaties do not grant carte blanche for U.S. interventions on 
the scale currently under way. The coming days will be critical in establishing 
a lasting legal foundation for this politically momentous action.

The invasion fails any number of practical and psychiatric tests. It is both 
potty and inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
America, bizarrely, still fails to understand the nature of democracy. It is 
not some imported ideology to be imposed on a country. It must (see 
Czechoslovakia, see Hungary, see -- in time -- Romania) "spring" from within. 
It must, in the end, be what the people of Panama want and will themselves 
defend. It cannot be dumped on a country overnight by the U.S. Army. That will 
prove, over coming months, the bitterest legacy for President (Guillermo) 
Endara and Vice President Guillermo Ford. If they wanted -- down the long, 
grimy, historical road of Panamanian oscillations -- finally to provide their 
country with clean, free government, they arrive carrying a poisoned chalice 
hung on a Marine bayonet.

LONG TRIP ENDS WITH LONG GAME; 
</P>
<P>
LAKERS: JOHNSON, WORTHY HELP TIRED LOS ANGELES OVERCOME HOT-SHOOTING 
TIMBERWOLVES IN OVERTIME, 106-97. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His cheeks puffed out like Dizzy Gillespie's and his chest heaving, James 
Worthy slouched near midcourt after the Lakers had tamed the Minnesota 
Timberwolves in overtime Wednesday night, 106-97. 
</P>
<P>
Along came Magic Johnson, who stood next to his Laker teammate and gave him a 
brief smile and an even briefer hug. They were too tuckered out to exchange 
high-fives, back slaps or any other more taxing celebration. 
</P>
<P>
So ended an eight-game, 12-day trip, one that tested the Lakers' cardiovascular 
endurance and mental alertness everywhere from the snowbound East to balmy 
Florida to the frigid Midwest. The Lakers won five of eight games and headed 
back to Los Angeles on a late-night charter still leading the Pacific Division 
with a 19-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was fitting that it ended with an exhalation of relief, rather than 
exaltation, because this was anything but a pleasure trip for the Lakers. About 
the best you can say is that they absorbed their opponents' best shots and, for 
the most part, endured. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, somewhat ambitiously, had set a goal of 6-2 on the trip. They fell 
a victory short by blowing a 14-point fourth-quarter lead at Orlando, but they 
seemed satisfied overall. 
</P>
<P>
"A 5-3 trip is successful, as far as I'm concerned," Coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
"This makes my whole Christmas," Johnson said. "It was the best way to end the 
trip. We never quit; that's the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Enduring was the central theme again Wednesday night against the expansion 
Timberwolves. The Lakers, clearly dragging and flu-ridden, suffered through a 
first half in which the expansion Timberwolves shot 74.3% from the field and 
took a 12-point lead behind former Laker Tony Campbell, who had 18 of his 26 
points by halftime. The Lakers faced a 15-point third-quarter deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But, they mustered the resolve to finish off the Timberwolves and finish the 
trip with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I saw it," Worthy said, "we had taken their best shot. We just felt if 
we kept plugging we'd be in there." 
</P>
<P>
Overtime could not have been what the Lakers had in mind, but it took a 
monumental second-half comeback even to get to that position. 
</P>
<P>
After spending the fourth quarter whittling away at Minnesota's lead, the 
Lakers caught the Timberwolves (5-19) with 7.2 seconds to play when, after Sam 
Mitchell missed a free throw, Johnson went the length of the court for a 
score-tying layup. 
</P>
<P>
In overtime the Lakers summoned enough effort to outscore Minnesota by nine 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good way to end a long, long trip," Riley said. "I think our guys 
showed the effects of the trip, but you have to give them credit. The way they 
came back was indicative of their character and resolve. And, you want to thank 
Earvin Johnson (for making) the shot he had to with no timeouts left." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who had 26 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists; and Worthy, who had 
24 points, were the steadying influences during a mostly lethargic effort. So, 
it was not surprising that Johnson took control when the Lakers needed it most. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had a chance to tie it nine seconds before Johnson's layup. A.C. 
Green, who had 16 points and 15 rebounds while once again starting at center in 
place of injured Mychal Thompson, missed one of two free throws that would have 
tied it, 90-90. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Lakers fouled Mitchell one second after Green's second free throw. 
But Mitchell, a rookie forward who had 24 points, missed the second of two free 
throws for a 91-89 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Woolridge grabbed the rebound, and Johnson immediately moved toward the 
ball. Near midcourt, Johnson paused to check the clock and avoid Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson twisted between Mitchell and Campbell and banked in the layup to tie 
it. Minnesota then tried to score quickly, but Green knocked away Sidney Lowe's 
pass. With 3.7 seconds left, three Lakers converged on Campbell, who bobbled 
the inbounds pass and dropped it out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
A full-length Laker inbounds pass with 1.4 seconds intended for Woolridge went 
astray, but Johnson ran it down and flung it over his left shoulder toward the 
basket. It hit the rim and fell out. 
</P>
<P>
Such a miraculous finish somehow would not have been appropriate for the Lakers 
on this trip. They had to work overtime to earn the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were in control the entire five minutes, a departure from their only 
previous overtime experience, when they went scoreless against the Detroit 
Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
When it was finally over, the Lakers were happy but a little tired. 
</P>
<P>
"No, a lot tired," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
That could only partially account for the continuation of their outside 
shooting problems. The Lakers made only 39.8% of their shots, but found success 
in the second half using a bigger lineup featuring Woolridge and Vlade Divac 
against the smaller Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge, in his best game since coming off the injured list last week, scored 
20 points and had six rebounds. Divac added 16 points and 11 rebounds in 29 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a lot more comfortable out there," Woolridge said. "There are still 
times when I feel tentative. But I'm glad Pat had the confidence in me to leave 
me in there." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he had no choice but to go with a big lineup, since Laker guards 
were not hitting. Byron Scott made only two of 10 shots and failed to reach 
double figures for the third consecutive game. Michael Cooper missed all five 
shots he attempted. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got to get in the habit of moving the ball again," Riley said. "We've 
only had one or two practices in the last two weeks. So, right now, our offense 
is sluggish, lethargic and boring." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Byron Scott has made only two of his last 17 shots. Coach Pat Riley said the 
Lakers need to improve the ball movement in the half-court offense to enable 
Scott to take open jump shots. Said Scott: "I'm kind of hesitating too much. 
I'll just call it a little slump. You got to keep going and play both ends of 
the court (offense and defense)." Scott's defense limited former Laker Tony 
Campbell to six points in the second half. . . . Campbell on the Lakers: "I 
knew Magic wouldn't let them lose to an expansion team. I think the Lakers are 
still the Lakers. They may not be as glamorous without Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar), 
but they are still a great team."

'RUSSELL ERA' ENDS AS FAILURE IN SACRAMENTO

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first words out of Gregg Lukenbill's mouth were as subtle as a plummeting 
guillotine blade. "It's over," the Sacramento Kings' owner told Bill Russell 
simply. After Monday's short conversation, Russ went straight to his office, 
cleaned out his desk, got into his car, and vanished into the dark and the fog. 
</P>
<P>
He took it well, Lukenbill suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Someone who saw him shortly afterward, bent over his desk, said Russell 
appeared shattered. 
</P>
<P>
That would figure. His two-plus years as the Kings' front-office boss -- which 
produced 57 wins and 127 losses, and led to his firing and his coach's 
demotion, which the club announced Tuesday -- represents a catastrophic failure 
for a proud, even arrogant man who never before in his 55 years had failed 
catastrophically. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball was decidedly simpler when Bill was a player: two national titles at 
the University of San Francisco. An Olympic gold medal. Eleven championships in 
13 seasons with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
You could say he failed in Seattle in the '70s ... but the team he built went 
to the finals the year after he was canned, and won a title the next year, so 
Russell could tell himself he had something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
He failed as the coach here, too -- 17 wins, 41 losses -- but he could tell 
himself it was with another man's players. 
</P>
<P>
But now, these are HIS Kings. He drafted Kenny Smith, Vinny Del Negro and 
Pervis Ellison. He traded for Wayman Tisdale, Danny Ainge, Rodney McCray and 
Ralph Sampson. He'd run off 11 of the 12 men he ... inherited, all except 
Harold Pressley. 
</P>
<P>
Yet they're 6-15. They've lost five in a row. And they face four games in five 
nights on the road, then four quality opponents at home, which Lukenbill feared 
would leave them at 6-23. 
</P>
<P>
What, one wonders, can Russ tell himself this time? 
</P>
<P>
Some of it was bad luck, he would argue, and rightly: Ricky Berry's suicide ... 
Pervis Ellison's tendinitis, keeping him out of all but four games ... 
Sampson's bad wheel. 
</P>
<P>
And three close losses this season that might have been wins had Berry or 
Ellison been out there, or if coach Jerry Reynolds had been more experienced. 
</P>
<P>
Russell can tell himself the Kings would have been 9-11, and people would have 
been saying how improved the club was. 
</P>
<P>
He can tell himself that Ellison, whom he was booed for drafting, will be a 
force in pro basketball once his foot heals, and then people will be praising 
the guts Russell showed when he drafted him. 
</P>
<P>
All of that's on the one hand. 
</P>
<P>
On the other are 57 wins and 127 defeats, mostly on merit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm frustrated," Lukenbill said. "The fans are frustrated. ... Sooner or later 
you make your own luck. ... It was time for a change." 
</P>
<P>
It was time for a change when he hired Russ, too, and change came in an 
avalanche: 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Theus went for Randy Wittman and a first-round pick that the Kings spent 
on Berry. Theus is scoring 19 a night in Orlando, Wittman is gone, Berry dead. 
</P>
<P>
Otis Thorpe, a good rebounder who was asking big money, was dispatched for 
McCray and Jim Petersen, then Jim hurt a knee. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Kleine, the center, and forward Ed Pinckney were traded to Boston for 
Ainge, a guard, and 7-footer Brad Lohaus. Then Lohaus was lost to the expansion 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
LaSalle Thompson, a powerful rebounder, was traded for Tisdale, a scorer, who 
demanded and got more dough than Thorpe ever dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Russ realized all his rebounders were gone -- Thorpe, Kleine, 
Pinckney, Thompson, Lohaus -- and so he drafted Ellison, then gave up Petersen 
to get Sampson. 
</P>
<P>
And both showed up lame. 
</P>
<P>
It undermined Reynolds. The Kings have been outrebounded in 18 of their first 
20 games. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when Lukenbill and Reynolds talked until 2 in the morning after Sunday 
night's loss -- "I told him, 'If you want to keep coaching, you're welcome to,' 
" Lukenbill says -- Jerry took the heat. 
</P>
<P>
"Gregg," he said, "I think you can do better." 
</P>
<P>
So, for a second time, he finds himself shepherding this ballclub along until a 
coach can be found. His only sin was a lack of experience, and this was a poor 
bunch for on-the-job training. As director of player personnel, however, the 
ebullient Reynolds is perfectly suited to form fast alliances around the league 
-- something the reclusive Russell never managed or even attempted. 
</P>
<P>
Bill's only close connections were with his old coach, Red Auerbach, who stole 
Kleine and Pinckney; and with teammate Don Nelson, who stiffed him with 
Sampson. 
</P>
<P>
As for the head-coaching vacancy, Gregg wants Dick Motta, supposedly. The 
consensus is, Motta is not interested. The same is said to be true of Seattle 
aide K.C. Jones. John MacLeod would do nicely, however. Stan Albeck is known to 
be eager to get back in the league and would be a popular, powerful choice. 
</P>
<P>
There is also Frank Hamblen, the assistant Lukenbill fired before bringing in 
Russell. Hamblen, clever and aggressive, left bitter, done in by then-G.M. Joe 
Axelson, who wearied of Frank's telling him he was screwing things up -- which 
he was. At the time, Joe had Lukenbill's ear, and he was whispering "Russell." 
</P>
<P>
Sacking Hamblen, Lukenbill now allows, "was probably a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Russell will be remembered as another kind of mistake. Firing him, Lukenbill 
thinks, was almost a favor. "It hasn't been pleasant for Bill," he said. "I 
think Bill would tell you that ... if he'd talk to you."

CHARGERS PUT THREE IN PRO BOWL; 
</P>
<P>
NFL: WILLIAMS, MILLER AND O'NEAL ARE HONORED. BUT EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW WHY 
GILL BYRD WAS LEFT OUT.

<P>
Three Chargers made the AFC'S Pro Bowl squad Wednesday, but much of the talk in 
the locker room concerned one who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Lee Williams was a repeater for the game in Honolulu Feb. 4, and 
wide receiver Anthony Miller and outside linebacker Leslie O'Neal were 
first-time selections. Williams, the only Charger so honored last year, was 
picked as a starter for the second consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
But cornerback Gill Byrd was left out, and there was a strong feeling that this 
was an injustice. Byrd was named an alternate along with inside linebacker 
Billy Ray Smith. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, Byrd has intercepted seven passes, most by a 
Charger since 1963. He also has made 55 tackles, forced two fumbles and 
defensed 10 passes. Still, the poll of players and coaches made him only the 
fourth alternate. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' workout Wednesday was limited to a walk-through in the parking 
lot at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, and Byrd left immediately afterward. When 
Rick Smith, the club's public relations director, reached him at home and asked 
him to talk to reporters in a conference call, he declined. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and Smith were especially vocal about Byrd's omission from the team. 
</P>
<P>
"A situation like that," Williams said, "I can more or less categorize as a 
modern-day crime." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "Gill got robbed. He should have been the first guy chosen." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning agreed but as a veteran of such elections, he said he could 
understand how it happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Byrd is definitely a Pro Bowl-quality cornerback in the AFC," Henning 
said. "But sometimes some of the best guys are overlooked because of their 
consistency. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around some guys who got elected to the Pro Bowl who make big plays 
and get a great deal of acclaim, but don't come close to this guy's efficiency 
and proficiency this year. I can't remember him getting beat on a major play. 
He plays hurt, and he doesn't make mistakes. I don't think I've ever been on a 
team with a defensive back as sound and consistent as he has been. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet it doesn't surprise me, because I know the way these things are done. I've 
seen cases where the players just hurry through the voting and go home." 
</P>
<P>
Smith took the news in stride, saying, "Being an alternate is a role I'm used 
to. It happened in '86 and '87, too." 
</P>
<P>
As for the three Chargers who were elected, Williams felt a sense of 
satisfaction, Miller was excited and O'Neal looked upon the honor as the 
culmination of a long road back from knee problems. Williams leads the AFC with 
12 sacks and has made 62 tackles. Miller has caught 70 passes, and O'Neal has 
made 10 1/2 sacks and 88 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Their reactions: 
</P>
<P>
Williams: "I have an obvious feeling of elation. This was something I set out 
to do this year. It showed everybody that last year wasn't a fluke trip. It 
showed people who didn't believe it was a legitimate accolade that I could do 
it again." 
</P>
<P>
Miller: "You have to be happy when you get something like that. I thought I was 
having a Pro Bowl year. Now I'd like to catch 100 balls in a season. Anybody 
would like to have that type of goal." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal: "I don't mind not starting. I'm just happy to get there. I felt like I 
was on my way to the Pro Bowl my first year until I got hurt. After all I've 
gone through since, I'm very thankful. There were a lot of dark days in 
between." 
</P>
<P>
After suffering a knee injury in the 13th game of the 1986 season, when he was 
the NFL's defensive rookie of the year, O'Neal underwent six operations. He 
didn't play again until the eighth game last year.

Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Beathard, the leading candidate to succeed Steve Ortmayer as the 
Chargers' director of football operations, is expected to meet with owner Alex 
Spanos next week. . . . Charger wide receiver Phil McConkey probably will 
retire after Sunday's season finale against the Denver Broncos at San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium. After that, he may run for the U.S. Senate in New York. 
McConkey told the New York Daily News, "Some Republican leaders have urged me 
to start thinking about running." . . . Charger Coach Dan Henning wouldn't say 
why he had held only a walk-through practice. Pressed for an explanation, he 
said, "I think I've made it clear that I'm not going to address that question." 
He gave the players a day off last Wednesday, and they responded by upsetting 
Kansas City. . . . The Chargers listed tight end Andy Parker (hip) as 
questionable and safety Vencie Glenn (hand), defensive end Burt Grossman 
(groin), center Courtney Hall (hip), nose tackle Joe Phillips (ankle), 
cornerback Elliot Smith (ankle) and offensive tackle Joel Patten (hand) as 
probable. . . . For the Broncos, wide receiver Ricky Nattiel (knee) is out. 
Cornerback Mark Haynes (ankle) is doubtful. Linebacker Scott Curtis (back) and 
safety Dennis Smith (neck) are questionable, and cornerback Wymon Henderson 
(groin), defensive end Brad Henke (shoulder), linebacker Marc Munford (elbow) 
and linebacker Bruce Klostermann (hamstring) are probable. . . . The Chargers 
project a ticket sale of 50,000, so the game will be blacked out locally. The 
Raider game Nov. 12 was the season's only home sellout.

GILL SCORES 27 AS ILLINOIS DEFEATS MISSOURI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Kendall Gill made sure Illinois retained its stranglehold over Missouri 
Wednesday night at the St. Louis Arena, but he refused to exercise the Fighting 
Illini's bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best team we've faced," Gill said after scoring 27 points to lead 
fifth-ranked Illinois (7-0) over No. 4 Missouri, 101-93. "It takes a little 
luck and a lot of hard work." 
</P>
<P>
Gill, who has shaken off a mild early-season shooting slump, helped Illinois 
beat Missouri for the seventh consecutive time. The Illini lead the series, 
8-1. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri (9-1) got no closer than seven points the rest of the way despite a 
closing flurry by Anthony Peeler, who finished with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 Georgetown 97, Virginia Tech 64 -- Despite being unbeaten through eight 
games with an 37-point average margin of victory, Georgetown Coach John 
Thompson isn't ready to concede his Hoyas are a "good team." 
</P>
<P>
At least not by his standards. 
</P>
<P>
"We could be a good team, but we're not right now," he said after the easy win 
over Virginia Tech (4-3) at Landover, Md., "but it's better for my health if we 
win by 30 or 40 points." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Tillmon scored 29 points and Alonzo Mourning added 27 to lead the Hoyas to 
their 25th consecutive victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
No. 8 Louisiana St. 73, NW Louisiana 63 -- Wayne Sims scored 16 points and 
Louisiana State struggled to a 10-point victory on its home court in a game in 
which the Tigers were booed as they left the court at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern Louisiana (1-7) had taken a three-point lead on Gregg Hardin's 
shot at the buzzer, and the frustrated Tigers, plagued by foul trouble, headed 
for the locker room to a chorus of boos. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dale Brown opted for a full-court press and man-to-man defense in the 
second half, and the Tigers (5-1) responded by starting the final 20 minutes 
with a 25-6 run. 
</P>
<P>
High-scoring Chris Jackson had just 13 points on three-of-16 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 Memphis St. 59, New Orleans 55 -- Elliot Perry scored 25 points to lead 
the Tigers at Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
Perry was nine for 15 from the field and made seven of eight free throws as 
Memphis State (5-1) broke from a 50-50 tie. 
</P>
<P>
No. 25 Michigan State 80, Evansville 66 -- Ken Redfield scored 20 points and 
Kirk Mannis added 14 for the Spartans (8-2) as they recovered from poor 
first-half shooting to win at Evansville, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Shreffler scored 27 points and Dan Godfread had 15 points and 14 rebounds 
for the Purple Aces (4-6). 
</P>
<P>
Dayton 84, DePaul 73 -- Negele Knight scored 22 points and Anthony Corbitt and 
Noland Robinson added 16 each for the Flyers (5-2) at Rosemont, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Demons (3-7) dropped their fifth in a row, despite 16 second-half 
points -- including four straight three-pointers -- from Terry Davis. David 
Booth led the Blue Demons with 17, and Melvon Foster added 16. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia 63, Va. Commonwealth 46 -- John Crotty scored 20 points and Bryant 
Stith added 16 as the Cavaliers took the lead for good early in the game and 
rolled to an easy win over the Rams (4-4) in the opening round of the 
Times-Dispatch Invitational Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia (7-1) will meet Richmond, a 69-62 winner over Old Dominion, in the 
championship game tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee 92, Western Carolina 66 -- Ronnie Reese scored 17 points and Greg 
Bell added 16 to lead the Volunteers (5-3) at Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
The Volunteers added to a 36-23 halftime lead with a flurry of three-point 
shots early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 77, Washington 60 -- Melvin Newbern scored a season-high 23 points 
and led a ball-hawking defense as the Gophers won at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the sixth sin a row for Minnesota (6-1), which recorded 14 
steals and held Washington (4-3) to just 10 second-half field goals. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue 60, California 55 -- Tony Jones and Stephen Scheffler each scored 13 
points and the Boilermakers (6-1) held the Bears (6-2) scoreless in the final 
3:15 for the victory in West Lafayette, Ind.

THE BOTTOM TEN: FORGET THE MONDAY NIGHT HIGHLIGHTS; HOW ABOUT THE LOWLIGHTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
THE BOOB TUBE 
</P>
<P>
One reason to look forward to the NFL playoffs is that it will mean the end of 
"Monday Night Football" -- and the producers' weekly self-congratulatory 
exercise of polling viewers for memorable moments of the show's last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
You know, "Greatest Three-Point Stance by an Offensive Lineman Not on 
Steroids." 
</P>
<P>
There's been one grievous omission, too. So, the Bottom Ten pollsters gathered 
in an emergency session to vote on the show's lowest moments, some of which are 
recounted in "Monday Night Mayhem," by Marc Gunther and Bill Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear with Faultless Frank, 
Dandy Don, Humble Howard, The Hammer (yes, The Hammer!) and others . . . 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY NIGHT LOWLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
1. (1970): Keith Jackson is forced to call a series of plays with his pants leg 
on fire, the result of a cigarette dropped by Howard Cosell that ignites some 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
2. (1970): Cosell, feeling ill, reportedly braces himself with several vodkas 
and then throws up on colleague Don Meredith's boots. He (Cosell) leaves the 
game at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
3. (1973): Meredith refers on the air to President Nixon as "Tricky Dick" when 
he suggests that the Redskins consult Nixon to improve their playbook. 
</P>
<P>
4. (1974): Rookie announcer Fred (the Hammer) Williamson enrages Cosell during 
an exhibition game by saying, "Even an old cripple like you could have made 
more yardage through that hole, Howard." The Hammer is fired before the regular 
season starts. 
</P>
<P>
5. (1980): Violence by drunken fans at a game in Foxboro, Mass., is so severe 
that local lawmakers unsuccessfully petition ABC to start Monday night games in 
the East at 8 p.m. instead of 9 p.m. so that fans will have less time to drink 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
6. (1970-1989): Any of the hundreds of visits to the announcing booth by a cast 
member of an ABC television series. 
</P>
<P>
7. (1983): Cosell snaps back angrily at O.J. Simpson on the air after Simpson 
jokingly comments: "Howard, you've proved once again you have a tremendous 
grasp of the obvious -- to use one of your lines." 
</P>
<P>
8. (1985): Reverse-angle camera enables viewers to get innumerable varied 
close-ups of the Giants' Lawrence Taylor breaking the leg of Redskin 
quarterback Joe Theismann. ABC did everything except ask Taylor to make a wish 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
9. (1985): Cosell's book, "I Never Played the Game," makes its debut, revealing 
what he really thinks of his on-air buddies . . . Frank Gifford is "a male 
mannequin," Meredith "rarely prepared," etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
10. (1989): The show's grating theme song, written and howled by Hank Williams 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
It has been a bleak winter for Bill quarterback Jim Kelly, who is 0-3 since 
coming back from an injury to push Buffalo to the top of the Swoon Conference. 
In a televised confrontation last week, Bill running back Thurman Thomas was 
asked what was wrong with Buffalo -- besides the weather -- and replied: "The 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Thomas wasn't referring to Kelly's midseason replacement, Frank 
Reich, who posted a 3-0 record, including a win over the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
As a strategic move, benching Reich ranks up there with the firing of Gene 
Stallings by Phoenix's Larry Wilson, once known as the league's meanest 
defensive back and now known as the league's meanest general manager. The 
Cardinals were 5-6 with Stallings, 0-4 since. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills' Kelly doesn't need Buffalo, though. There's another football man who 
is always in the market for a veteran quarterback. That's George Allen, the new 
head coach of Cal State Long Beach. Unless, of course, Billy Kilmer enrolls 
there first.

RESORTS PLAN FOR A WHITE CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB LOCHNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's beginning to look a lot like skiers will have a white Christmas, after all 
-- at least where they've been able to fool Mother Nature. 
</P>
<P>
No natural snow has fallen in California since late on Thanksgiving weekend, 
but persistent cold temperatures have enabled those resorts with snowmaking 
capability to expand lift operations and enter the big holiday week in 
relatively good shape. 
</P>
<P>
Five Southland ski areas -- Bear Mountain, Snow Summit, Snow Valley, Mountain 
High and Snow Forest -- are open and ready for the hordes expected between now 
and New Year's Day. Snow depths, all man-made, range from 10 to 36 inches. 
</P>
<P>
In the High Sierra, Mammoth Mountain is offering skiing on about one-quarter of 
its terrain, while using portable snowmaking machines to augment the 12- to 
36-inch base created by two early-season storms. Owner Dave McCoy called the 
chances of getting through the holidays without another snowfall, "Nip and 
tuck." 
</P>
<P>
Farther north, it's a similar situation: Where there's snowmaking, there's 
fairly good but limited skiing. Elsewhere in the Sierra, the hoped-for white 
(and green) Christmas may turn out to be more of a tattle-tale gray. 
</P>
<P>
Recent storms have resulted in improved ski conditions throughout much of the 
Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The best bets for the holidays, at the moment, include Steamboat, Vail and 
Summit County in Colorado; Snowbird and Alta in Utah; Big Sky and Big Mountain 
in Montana; Grand Targhee in Wyoming, and Taos in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The Alps, on the other hand, are presently more suitable for mountain-biking 
than skiing, and this has made a shambles of the Alpine World Cup racing 
schedule, which has been placed on hold until the first weekend in January. 
</P>
<P>
Three men's races were canceled in the last week because of poor snow 
conditions -- one of two downhills at Val Gardena, Italy; a slalom at Madonna 
di Campiglio, Italy, and another downhill that had been tentatively moved from 
Saalbach-Hinterglemm to Schladming, Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Three-time champion Pirmin Zurbriggen of Switzerland won last Saturday's 
downhill at Val Gardena to move ahead of Christian Ole Furuseth in the overall 
standings, 126 points to 118. Armin Bittner of West Germany is third with 79. 
</P>
<P>
All of the early women's action was staged in North America, during a four-week 
span that ended with a pair of downhills last weekend at Panorama, Canada. 
Petra Kronberger of Austria won both races at the British Columbia resort to 
move into third place in the overall standings with 98 points, 15 behind leader 
Michaela Gerg of West Germany and five in back of runner-up Anita Wachter of 
Austria.

HOLLYWOOD PARK;

<P>
A SHORTAGE OF JOCKEYS HITS TRACK 
</P>

<P>
The way jockeys were becoming increasingly scarce Wednesday, George Taniguchi 
and Emile Ohayon probably thought they might be pressed into service at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the long-retired Taniguchi, now a paddock judge at the track, nor 
Ohayon, the press box mutuel clerk, saw action, but a lot of unfamiliar names 
popped up on the day's card. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the afternoon, six of the eight leading riders were absent for 
one reason or another. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye and Gary Stevens, 1-2 in the standings heading into the 
final week, are on mini-vacations, awaiting Santa Anita's opening Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron, who is seventh, called in sick Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Solis, sixth among the riders, stayed home because he was concerned about 
family and friends in his native Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Apprentice Corey Nakatani, tied for third place with Laffit Pincay, missed most 
of the program after being dumped in a gruesome incident in the third race. 
Hammerin' Hank, a 2-year-old making his first start on the turf, suddenly 
veered into the rail near the three-eighths pole. Failing in his attempt to 
jump the fence, the Gold Stage colt severed his right front leg and bled to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Nakatani was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center, where X-rays of his 
left knee were negative. He could return today, according to Dr. Robert Kerlan. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Davis, who rode the longshot winner in the third, Short Timer, asked to 
be taken off the remainder of his mounts. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron lost three winning mounts through his absence. Aaron Gryder, recently 
returned to the Southland, picked up one, Peppy's Kingdom in the second race, 
and Pincay got two -- favorites Snow Perch in the fifth and Sumthing Rare in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Solis forfeited Short Timer, and George Almeida replaced Davis on Oh Sweet 
Thing, who rallied to take the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Nakatani comes back today, he'd have to finish with a rush to wrest the 
Hollywood Park jockey title from Delahoussaye. 
</P>
<P>
The Covina-born teen-ager would need nine victories in the final four days to 
pass Delahoussaye, who was also the top rider at Del Mar and Santa Anita's Oak 
Tree meeting. 
</P>
<P>
While the local title would be a definite boost for Nakatani, he has another 
objective in mind these days -- specifically, the Eclipse Award for 
apprentices. Riding against the nation's deepest and strongest colony, he has 
held his own, but whether he has the numbers to impress enough voters remains 
to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
His 106 winners this year places Nakatani well down the list among apprentices. 
Unofficially, however, he leads in terms of money won, having passed 
Maryland-based Mike Luzzi, who has the most victories. 
</P>
<P>
With the Eclipse election under way, Luzzi would have to be considered the 
favorite, primarily because he's more familiar back East, where the majority of 
the voters reside. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Corey Black's mounts earned roughly $1 million more, but Allen Stacy, 
another Eastern-based apprentice, had more wins and walked off with the 
Eclipse. 
</P>
<P>
"To win the Eclipse is my main goal," said Nakatani, who will keep his 
five-pound weight allowance until the end of Santa Anita's meeting next April. 
"I think I have a good chance. I know it's going to be difficult, but I think 
this is probably the toughest circuit in America and the toughest place to 
break in." 
</P>
<P>
What has helped Nakatani establish himself is having Tony Matos, Pincay's 
longtime partner, as his agent. And Pincay, too, has been a positive factor. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, Laffit is the best rider, and I've always liked his style," Nakatani 
said. "He was my idol. I've got to credit a lot of my success to him. He's 
really helped me in a lot of ways." 
</P>
<P>
A wrestler in high school, Nakatani became infatuated with his current sport 
when he visited Santa Anita one morning with his father. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to watch the workouts with him when I was 15 and I told him I wanted to 
(be a jockey)," he said. "I said I could do that." 
</P>
<P>
After attending a jockeys' school and working horses at Galway Downs, Nakatani 
rode his first race during the 1988 Del Mar season, while spending weekends at 
Caliente to gain experience, then came to Santa Anita last winter. 
</P>
<P>
He picked up his first win in the big leagues March 16 on 15-1 shot Silver 
Sabina. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling is something that is hard to explain," he said. "It just felt so 
good to win a race at Santa Anita against this kind of competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a lot to learn and I still have some improving to do, but I have 
confidence in my talent. Riding against these guys, I learn a lot, and they are 
willing to help you." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay said Nakatani, 19, "reminds me of me when I started," adding: "He looks 
a little like I did on a horse. 
</P>
<P>
"The most impressive thing about Corey is his desire. He wants to win and he'll 
do anything to win a race. He's strong and he doesn't give up on horses. I 
think he's going to do some good." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Oh Sweet Thing's victory enabled David Hofmans to regain the lead in the 
trainers' standings. He has 10 wins, one more than John Sadler and Ron 
McAnally. . . . Laconda, who was almost scratched, won the $32,000 feature, 
beating stablemate Trick Question by 1 1/4 lengths in the 1 1/8-mile race. 
Ridden by Russell Baze, who had two victories, Laconda returned $16.20 to win 
and provided trainer Gary Jones with his seventh victory of the meeting. . . . 
Apprentice jockey Jesus Castanon was also absent. Like Gary Stevens and Eddie 
Delahoussaye, he elected to take some time off for the holidays. . . . There is 
a Pick Six carryover for today of $59,193.15.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: THE DIRTY DOZEN HOPES TO KEEP 'EM ON 
THEIR FEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If you catch the Dirty Dozen Brass Band next Thursday night, Dec. 28, at the 
Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, don't expect to spend much time sitting. 
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans-based band has taken the instrumentation of a New Orleans 
marching band and brewed a tangy gumbo for the '80s and '90s: pulsing bass and 
sousaphone, with fast-moving rhythms, synchronized horn parts and plenty of 
improvisation slathered liberally on top. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied until people are on their feet," said trumpeter and band 
leader Gregory Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The year has been busy for the Dirty Dozen, which took its name from a New 
Orleans club but only has eight members. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the band's new album "Voodoo," recorded in 1987, was finally 
released on CBS Records after more than a year during which attorneys 
negotiated a new contract for the group. Downbeat promptly accorded 4 1/2 of 
five possible stars. 
</P>
<P>
Financially, it was worth the wait; the band signed a six-record deal. But the 
delay may have slowed their career in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have name recognition, it helps to have records coming out," 
Davis said. "Then you have something for critics to talk about, and it gets you 
out in the market and keeps you moving." 
</P>
<P>
The band has been much in demand among musicians. Elvis Costello used them on 
his last album, "Spike," and liked their work on the song "Stalin Malone" so 
much he decided to leave off his vocals. He returns the favor by singing a tune 
on the Dirty Dozen's new album, due for February release. 
</P>
<P>
With rock stars such as David Byrne and Paul Simon warming audiences to the 
possibilities of a variety of musical influences, the Dozen appears poised for 
more success. 
</P>
<P>
To its New Orleans roots -- including funeral marching bands, Louis Armstrong 
and Sidney Bechet -- the band adds blues, be-bop, and improvisations ranging 
from subtle twists of melody to unchained honking and screaming. 
</P>
<P>
Although their eclectic sound is impossible to categorize, that's been a virtue 
in the world of radio, according to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we play a mixed bag of things, we're able to get on some of the blues 
stations, some jazz formats, college radio. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people still don't know what we do. They think they do, from pictures 
or that scene in 'Live or Let Die,' the James Bond movie where we did a typical 
New Orleans funeral scene. We have to overcome that. Call us what you want. We 
play music you can dance to." 
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, a group of San Diegans decided to form a serious salsa band. 
Already, the 12-piece unit calling itself La Predilecta ("The Chosen One") has 
drawn the attention of top Latin players. In recent weeks, the ensemble has 
opened local shows for such spicemasters as Eddie Palmieri and Tito Puente. 
</P>
<P>
This Saturday night, the group plays a dance benefit for La Casa de Puerto 
Rico, a charitable organization that raised money for Puerto Rican hurricane 
relief last October, helps feed the homeless and gives scholarships to needy 
students, primarily of Puerto Rican background. 
</P>
<P>
Martin W. Padilla, La Predilecta's lead singer and founder, says the music is 
aimed at making people dance. The band's repertoire includes about a dozen 
original tunes, plus several fresh Latin arrangements of jazz standards. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the Christmas dance at the downtown Marriott Hotel, which begins 
at 8 p.m., is $10 in advance, $12 at the door. For information, call 461-6148. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Liberace's gone, who will carry his flamboyant torch? One possibility 
is San Diego pianist Peter Robberecht, who brings back memories of glittery 
suits and giant candelabras. 
</P>
<P>
"The way to define what I'm after is, I will be a New Age Liberace," said 
Robberecht, who hopes to get a career break with some of his slow, dreamy demo 
tapes, though his true love is cutting loose on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Robberecht starts his audiences out low-key. But, halfway through his set, he 
kicks away the piano bench, dons dark glasses and launches into his version of 
Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire." The number peaks when Robberecht 
executes his famous "bun run," a cheeky slide across the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
"That gets a hoot and holler," Robberecht said. "You spend your life trying to 
become a major artist, then you slide your butt across the keys and people go 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Despite traces of Liberace, Barry Manilow and Elton John in Robberecht, his 
musical background is classical. His mother plays classical piano, and 
Robberecht cut his chops on Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart and such modern pianists 
as Van Cliburn and Vladimir Horowitz. 
</P>
<P>
Robberecht plays happy hours Wednesday through Saturday at the Catamaran, and 
will also be on the night shift Fridays and Saturdays through January. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: San Diego will gain another resident jazz giant in the New Year. As of 
Jan. 1, guitarist Barney Kessel joins saxophonist James Moody and guitarist 
Mundell Lowe in a line of recent immigrants. . . . Diego's Loft weekend: 
Friday, John Best and Bobby Gordon; Saturday, Algo Caliente. . . . Mose Allison 
will appear on KPBS-TV's "Club Date" program at 5 p.m. Friday.

RETURNING TO YESTERYEAR WITH THE TOYS OF CHILDHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
COLLECTIBLES: IN A TREND THAT'S PART NOSTALGIA, PART PROFIT, DEMAND FOR 
YESTERDAY'S PLAYTHINGS IS UP.

<P>
Memories of toys from childhoods long past come surging to the fore this time 
of year: the train set that circled the Christmas tree in 1959, the shiny 
silver cap gun that transformed a runny-nosed kid into Hopalong Cassidy, or the 
toy soldiers that once stood guard against dirt-clod assaults. 
</P>
<P>
But memories are all that most adults have of these toys, unless they happen to 
belong to the growing ranks of those who collect them. Toys are in demand -- 
whether they are dolls, radio premiums, trains, airplanes or cap guns -- partly 
because of nostalgia and partly for their collectible value. 
</P>
<P>
A recent edition of Antique Toy World magazine contained 10 pages of classified 
ads offering to sell or buy toys, and listed more than 140 dates for toy shows 
from such places as Kansas, New Jersey and Texas to Pomona and West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hamburg, 50, is a gun collector. 
</P>
<P>
When guests first see his toy gun collection, which fills the gun room in his 
Woodland Hills home, "most people discover they still have that little child 
inside them," says Hamburg. "Then they try and find their old cap gun from 
their childhood." 
</P>
<P>
Hamburg, a sales manager for the Southern California Gas Co., became interested 
in cap guns while rummaging around a Washington state antique store on vacation 
seven years ago with his wife, Loretta. He spotted a Hubley 50-shot Texan 
six-shooter, a duplicate of the first cap gun he owned as a child. It was in 
excellent shape, but he didn't like the $35 price tag, so he reluctantly 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
The chance cap gun encounter started him collecting, first the cap guns he 
remembered as a child in the late 1940s, then others. Today, his earliest 
examples include an 1870 double-hammer pistol and a cast-iron 1887 Penny 
Pistol, so named because of it cost 1 cent. 
</P>
<P>
While Hamburg's collection has all sizes and shapes of cap guns, including 
models embossed with such names as Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, the Lone Ranger and 
Hopalong Cassidy, he says the most unusual are the animated ones made as 
novelties, not for children. 
</P>
<P>
One such cap gun, from the 1880s, has a cast-iron human figure about 1 1/2 
inches tall standing on the barrel. The gun goes off when the hammer strikes a 
cap that sits on the man's head. 
</P>
<P>
Two cap guns in his collection mean more to Hamburg than the nearly 300 others. 
</P>
<P>
The first is a cap pistol his father played with as a young boy, and the other, 
one of a dozen cap guns neatly displayed on a small glass table, is the Hubley 
Texan he first spotted in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had this urge to own it," he says. He drove back to the store a year 
later, without calling first, still hoping it would be there. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Steiner, 45, owns three dozen trucks, specifically Smith-Miller toy 
trucks made in the 1940s and '50s from die-cast aluminum. The two-foot-long 
vehicles were patterned after then-current prototypes, including moving vans, 
tank trucks, army vehicles and lumber trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend gave me one in so-so shape about eight years ago," says the West 
Valley resident, "and it reminded me of one I had when I was a kid. Restoring 
it rekindled a lot of old memories." 
</P>
<P>
While complete models in good shape are becoming scarce, Steiner says 
replacement parts have been easy to find since Valley resident Fred Thompson 
purchased in 1978 the stored remains of the Smith-Miller company, which went 
out of business in the mid-1950s. Besides replacement parts, Thompson also has 
been offering new truck models. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner tries to buy the trucks as cheaply as possible, knowing it will take 
about 40 hours of filing, bending, cleaning and undoing decades of disuse to 
return them to displayable shape. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner is constantly looking for more trucks to add to the collection that is 
displayed on boards mounted on the wall of his bedroom. Browsing through a 
hobby magazine or wandering around toy shows, he keeps his eye out for trucks, 
especially some of the older Chevy-style designs made in the late 1940s. 
"They're getting hard to find in any shape," he says, "especially now that 
people are realizing their value." 
</P>
<P>
Louis Steinberg's fond childhood memories rekindled a desire to collect 
three-inch-tall, pot-metal, dime store soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"They were made as toys you plunked a nickel or dime down at the store for," 
says the 59-year-old Chatsworth resident, "so they were meant to be played 
with. As children, we bombed, threw rocks and aimed marbles at them." 
</P>
<P>
The young Steinberg also made his own soldiers by pouring melted tire-balancing 
weights and foil from Lucky Strike cigarette packs into molds borrowed from a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
But when Steinberg grew up, he left them behind, until 20 years ago when he 
came across a Glendale garage sale that had, among other items, pot-metal, dime 
store soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"I had forgotten all about them," he says. "They were exactly what I 
remembered, and in excellent condition." He purchased all 15 soldiers for less 
than 50 cents apiece. Today, Steinberg can't say how many soldiers are in his 
collection, except that he has "uncounted thousands." 
</P>
<P>
Although there were dozens of small manufacturers, two, Barclay and Manoil, 
were the largest, Steinberg says. While all the figures were known as 
"soldiers," the various companies sold non-military figures as well, including 
doctors, nurses and lumberjacks. His rarest piece is a Barclay deep-sea diver 
holding an ax that he estimates is worth $300. Refurbished soldiers in good 
condition go for about $10. 
</P>
<P>
Someday, he hopes to display his soldiers in dioramas; a few are in custom 
cases. Most are stored in neatly stacked cardboard boxes in closets throughout 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like any other collectible," he says. "Hopefully, one day I'll have the 
joy of having them displayed." 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood dentist Dr. Hillel (Hilly) Lazarus, 54, regularly visits toy 
train conventions to add to his tin-plate train collection. 
</P>
<P>
Owning more than 200 locomotives and about 1,000 freight and passenger cars, 
Lazarus admits that he wasn't too careful with his first tin-plate train, which 
"bit the dust in the sandbox," when he was 3 years old. He can produce a 
picture of himself in the sandbox with the train to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
Lazarus prefers to collect the lesser-known pre-World War II American Flyer O 
gauge track, which was manufactured from 1907-42, to the more popularly known 
Lionel tin-plated iron and steel track. 
</P>
<P>
Lazarus collects not for the investment value but for his love of trains. 
</P>
<P>
"The nostalgic binge of the last 10 years has changed people's perceptions," he 
says. "Now instead of being an interesting hobby, some people just see dollar 
signs." 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to eventually display his trains -- everything is currently in storage 
-- Lazarus is active in toy train associations and can usually be found 
attending area swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
When people learn of his hobby, Lazarus says they usually comment, "I had one 
just like that when I was a kid," That's easier to take than the second 
most-heard line: "We used to have one like that, but we threw it away." 
</P>
<P>
Burbank writer Jim Harmon, 56, has been a collector all his life. Some of his 
600-piece radio premium collection contains items he sent away for as kid 
growing up in Mt. Carmel, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically it started with Little Orphan Annie in 1931. 'Send me an Ovaltine 
seal and a dime, and I'll send you a shake-up mug for your Ovaltine,' " he 
says, recalling the premium advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of radio premiums rose and fell with radio dramas, and the last 
of them, which evaporated with the beginning of television, were offered in the 
late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a form of a ratings service," says Harmon, explaining why sponsors 
offered premiums. "There was no profit, and the cost of the premium had to stay 
in the advertising budget. They just wanted to run a survey of how many kids 
were listening." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the sponsors' motivations, it was a delight to kids, says Harmon, with 
almost every show at one time or another offering everything from drinking mugs 
to dioramas, rings, telescopes and pedometers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his most prized pieces are the premiums that flopped. 
</P>
<P>
When "Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy" offered a telescope, millions were 
mailed out, Harmon says. But when the same sponsor offered a gardenia bracelet 
for girls that would glow in the dark, it was a bomb. Only about 200 were 
requested; Harmon has copies of the cereal company's records to prove it. The 
premium was withdrawn after two days. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon figures the most popular radio premium giveaways were from the most 
popular show, cowboy Tom Mix and his horse Tony on "The Tom Mix Show," 
sponsored by Ralston Purina. "They gave away premiums almost every month," 
Harmon says, including a wooden model of Mix's six-shooter, which the collector 
owns, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon's personal favorite is the cardboard and paper Lone Ranger frontier 
town, given away by the sponsor Cheerios, which duplicates one he had as a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to locate nine different numbers on nine different packages of 
Cheerios and then send in for four different kits with nine box tops to get 
everything, including the sheriff's office, the stage line office -- 66 
buildings in all -- and you could follow the Lone Ranger's adventures on your 
model. Mother was very supportive," he says with a laugh. In one of those "I 
don't know why I did it" moments in his 20s, Harmon threw out the set. Now, 
he's finally gotten all the pieces of another one. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been slowly setting it up. It's so big, my wife said I could set it up on 
the dining-room table, but then I wouldn't know where we'd eat."

THE INMATE CHOIR WILL SING CAROLS, BUT THEY WON'T HAVE A TREE AT PITCHESS HONOR 
RANCHO

Last Christmas, Johnny Austin was the choir director at Love of God Missionary 
Baptist Church in Los Angeles. He spent Christmas Eve leading his splendidly 
robed choir in holiday carols. 
</P>
<P>
This Christmas he'll again be leading a choir, except the church will be a 
concrete barracks, his singers will be dressed in orange jumpsuits, and Austin 
will be wearing a plastic wrist band that identifies him as inmate No. 1401767. 
</P>
<P>
Austin went after his stepson with a shotgun earlier this year and so he will 
be spending Christmas with the approximately 6,800 other inmates at the massive 
Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho prison complex in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone would have told me I was going to be in jail this Christmas, I would 
have told them they were crazy," said Austin, 42, as he swept the barracks 
behind gate No. 2, preparing for choir practice. "My wife and I had a dispute, 
then her 325-pound son came at me with a machete. I had a gun. I didn't shoot 
him, but I shot his car. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to pay for that. No one was hurt, but I used a gun." 
</P>
<P>
Austin lives in Medium South, a medium-security area. There are few trappings 
of the holiday season in this compound, where about 1,800 men sleep on 
thin-mattressed bunk beds, 90 to a barracks, separated from the "outside" by 
several layers of chain-link fences topped off by spirals of barbed wire. 
Between the fences lie wind-swept no man's lands, watched over by roving armed 
patrols and deputies looking down from guard towers. 
</P>
<P>
There are no Christmas trees and no decorations. On Christmas Day, relatives 
and friends will be permitted to visit for up to an hour, but visitors will not 
be permitted to bring presents other than shoes or a Bible, and those items 
must be approved by a member of the medical staff or one of the chaplains. 
</P>
<P>
"Not much of a place to spend Christmas," said Robert Taylor, 26, with a smile 
as he sat on a crowded bench in a barracks, looking away from a television that 
was blasting out a Lakers game. Most of Taylor's family is in Detroit -- he has 
not had a visitor since he arrived at Medium South in July on a probation 
violation, and he has no expectation that he will have one on Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been in prison before for Christmas, but I was here for 
Thanksgiving," he said, the smile growing broader. "It was just like any other 
day. If we didn't have turkey, dressing and pumpkin pie, you wouldn't have 
known it was Thanksgiving." 
</P>
<P>
But if it doesn't look or feel like the Christmas season in many parts of 
Medium South, at least it sounds like it in the evenings in the barracks behind 
gate No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's sing it like you mean it!" said Austin to a gathering of about 100 men 
in the barracks as they struggled, at individually selected pitches, through 
"Silent Night." 
</P>
<P>
"I know none of you want to be here for Christmas," he told them when the song 
sputtered to an end, "but if we do have to be here, we can cheer up someone who 
is maybe feeling lonely for home at Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Because of his previous experience in choral conducting, Austin had been chosen 
by Medium South prison chaplains Charles King and Alfred Little to form and 
lead a choir that will, if the prison administration allows, move through the 
compound on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never make plans 100% here," said Little, 70, who worked for the 
Southern California Gas Co. before he retired and became a licensed minister. 
"We are always on the verge of getting rejected. But we have faith that we will 
Christmas carol this year." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Little nor King receive a salary or any governmental support for their 
programs, although Little's prison work is partly subsidized by donations from 
King's son, a businessman. They are members of the Christian Chaplain Services, 
a Los Angeles organization that provides Protestant chaplains to prisons. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago we had more access," Little said. "The security is getting 
tighter all the time. We used to be able to take groups in to mingle with the 
inmates, but not anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"We can probably take only up to 15 inmates on the caroling," said King, who is 
also 70, and retired from teaching at Van Nuys High School. "But it will not 
just be a pickup group. They will be trained singers this year. That's because 
we have someone who is experienced to lead them." 
</P>
<P>
"We all know that preachers can fall too," Little said, and they both laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Back at choir practice, Austin explained that in the next couple of days he 
will have to pick his 20 best singers to do the caroling. "We need 15, but 
we've got to get 20 in case someone has to go to court and can't be here," he 
told the men. "Now let's do 'Silent Night,' again, and this time sing it for 
Jesus!" 
</P>
<P>
Inmate James Warren, who had come by to help set up the sound system, turned on 
a tape to provide musical accompaniment, but it was hardly needed. This time, 
with Austin urging them on with broad gestures, the men sang loudly, if no more 
in tune. 
</P>
<P>
Chaplain King stood to the side, beaming. "Music is so important to our work," 
he said. During Christmas week he will start all his daily church services with 
a recording of the "Hallelujah" chorus from Handel's "Messiah." 
</P>
<P>
"We started that tradition last year," King said. "Many of the men are not 
familiar with what we would call good music. At first they react like we would 
in the presence of rock music. You can see them fidgeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you can see them settle down. By Christmas Eve there will be tears in 
their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
The tears might not be just a reaction to the music. 
</P>
<P>
"This time of year is a very hard," said Jessie Fierro, 36, of El Monte who has 
been in and out of prison since he was a teen-ager. This time he faces up to 12 
years in Medium South or another prison. But Fierro, like several of the men 
who come to the church services the chaplains conduct, said prison life has 
been different for him since he underwent a religious conversion. 
</P>
<P>
"I have dedicated myself to the work of God," Fierro said. "I may be in bondage 
physically, but that is not important. I feel at liberty within. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the Lord, this time of year would be heartbreaking." 
</P>
<P>
He paused and looked out at the men singing "Joy to the World." 
</P>
<P>
"Even with the Lord, it's not easy." 
</P>
<P>
It is not hard to figure out what these men would most like as a Christmas 
present. And at least one of them got it. Just before choir practice began, an 
inmate came into the barracks soaking wet. 
</P>
<P>
"Looks like you got baptized!" said Fierro. The inmate was so excited he could 
hardly talk as he walked toward the men, his jumpsuit dripping onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going home," he said, grasping the hands of the other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
He was being released under the "early out" that was instituted in the crowded 
prison to make way for incoming inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"I was already starting my job in the kitchen when all my friends came in and 
said: 'You are going home! Get out of here! Go!' They gave me what we call a 
shower party," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He gave Fierro a hug and headed back outside toward the release line and the 
bus that would take him to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
After he was gone Warren looked toward the door. "Everyone else out there 
wanted their two front teeth for Christmas. All he wanted was a ride home."

HOLIDAYS MEAN CAUTION FOR ALLERGIC CHILDREN; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: CHRISTMAS TREES ARE A MAJOR SEASONAL OFFENDER FOR CHILDREN SENSITIVE TO 
MOLD AND DUST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The holiday season is supposed to be fun, but for children with asthma and 
allergies it's a time to be wary. 
</P>
<P>
Allergens and irritants that trigger allergic reactions and asthma symptoms are 
abundant at this time of year, physicians say, but even youngsters with severe 
asthma can celebrate the holidays -- if parents take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
It may seem impossible to avoid certain foods, pets, cigarette smoke or house 
dust, but that is the only effective way to protect a youngster who is 
sensitive to them, according to Dr. Daniel Hamilos, a staff physician at the 
National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Preventing symptoms with medication helps, especially when travel or dining 
away from home can increase the risk of severe reactions to foods, cold or 
other elements in the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"If you know your child has difficulty at this time of year, the child should 
go on preventative medication," said Dr. Allan M. Weinstein, a Washington, 
D.C., allergist and the author of "Asthma, The Complete Guide to 
Self-Management of Asthma and Allergies for Patients and Their Families." 
</P>
<P>
Parents should never take for granted a child's allergic symptoms, said 
Weinstein. "Some children may have symptoms at certain times of the year, or 
under certain circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
A major symbol of the season, the Christmas tree, can cause problems for some 
children if a live or cut tree is kept inside the home for more than a couple 
of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A Christmas tree left standing is a breeding ground for house dust and for mold 
spores that will grow in the water used to keep the tree fresh and green, said 
Dr. Gary S. Rachelefsky, clinical professor of allergy and immunology at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
For children sensitive to mold and dust, "the resulting discomfort may far 
outweigh the pleasure," he said. "There is no way to keep Christmas trees dust- 
and mold-free." 
</P>
<P>
Weinstein said problems result when "things that are not normally brought into 
the house, like trees, are now all of a sudden in the house. They can trigger 
allergic responses." 
</P>
<P>
He suggests that families with allergic children buy an artificial tree and 
that any other such live decorations be used outside the house. 
</P>
<P>
An artificial tree will reduce the growth of mold, but it should be wiped or 
spray-washed clean if it is being re-used, to get rid of accumulated dust. 
Christmas decorations that have been stored during the year should also be 
wiped clean. 
</P>
<P>
Rachelefsky, who is also a pediatric allergist and allergy researcher at the 
Allergy Research Foundation in Los Angeles, said it is elimination of the dust 
mite -- a tiny organism that lives in dust -- that reduces the severity and 
frequency of allergy symptoms. The mite, ingested through the nose, is what 
causes the allergic reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Food, pets, cigarette and cigar smoke, fireplace fires and cold air can also 
trigger allergic and asthmatic symptoms in children. 
</P>
<P>
But food allergens are difficult to control, especially during the holidays, 
when more meals are eaten away from home. 
</P>
<P>
If a child has shown signs of allergy to identified foods, "use extreme caution 
when sending the child out of your own home," Hamilos said. "You shouldn't 
trust other people's discretion in determining your child's intake. They don't 
have the knowledge to take care of it." 
</P>
<P>
He suggests parents talk with the host, specify what the child can eat and 
which foods he can't. "And never send him into a situation when there is any 
question about what will be served." 
</P>
<P>
Parents who ignore this caution "have their heads in the sand," Hamilos said. 
"The child has no desire to be sick. A young child may not be able to verbalize 
the problem." Items such as nuts, used in prepared turkey dressings, shellfish, 
which may be whipped in a dip or spread, and sulfites used in salads and dips 
are common triggers of food allergies. Pickles, too, if they're sold in jars, 
contain sulfites. 
</P>
<P>
When a holiday party is catered, it can be impossible to determine the food 
ingredients, so children should be instructed to avoid any prepared food 
they're not sure of. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco smoke can also be a problem at holiday time. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing a child with allergies or asthma into the home of a friend or relative 
for a Hanukkah meal or a Christmas visit where smoking is permitted will expose 
the child to an irritant known to cause respiratory distress, Rachelefsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms may not be seen for six to eight hours after the exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get an invitation," Rachelefsky advised, "find out if there might be 
smoking there. If there is, you shouldn't go. You're not limiting your 
children, you're just being practical." 
</P>
<P>
Parents should also control smoking in their own home, even when it means 
refusing a beloved guest. Permitting cigarette or cigar smokers to indulge at 
your holiday dinner is "stupid," Rachelefsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"A big sign should go up. Take the ashtrays away and if anyone smokes, kick 
them out. If they don't like it, you don't need them for friends." 
</P>
<P>
Children should be instructed to set limits when grown-ups indulge in holiday 
cheer and neglect to enforce the rules. They ought to be taught to protect 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a 4-year-old patient who told me, 'Dr. Rachelefsky, my parents have the 
nerve to make me go to Aunt -- -- 's house where there was cigarette smoke.' A 
child can tell a parent, 'I'm not going there. They have cigarette smoke.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even children as young as 3 can be made partners in their own care, the 
physicians said. Preschoolers are capable of acting responsibly for themselves 
and can be trained not only to recognize allergy triggers, but to take 
preventive medications on time and to know when to call for help. 
</P>
<P>
Refusing a small child who wants a kitten for Christmas may seem impossible, 
but allergy doctors warn that kittens, ponies, bunnies, puppies, hamsters, 
gerbils and mice should never be given to children with allergies or asthma. 
</P>
<P>
Prolonged exposure to the animal's dander or urine will produce the classic 
warning signs: nasal congestion, sneezing, itchy skin and wheezing. 
</P>
<P>
Although families with allergic children shouldn't have pets in the house, 
Rachelefsky said, some parents buy them anyway. "They get rid of doctors before 
they get rid of pets." 
</P>
<P>
He recommends hermit crabs, reptiles, turtles or fish, and Hamilos prefers 
fish, "the safest pet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The average child with allergies or asthma has mild to moderate disease that 
can be well managed, the physicians said, but parents should note that asthma 
fatalities have increased 25% since 1979, despite a growing awareness of it at 
all levels of society. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilos said denial of the problem by parents or children, continued exposure 
to known allergy triggers and under use of medication are the principal reasons 
for the increase in fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, exposure to animal dander can result in severe symptoms that may 
not be easily reversed. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke from gas- or wood-burning fireplaces that aren't well-ventilated or 
enclosed can also cause breathing problems for children with allergies. 
</P>
<P>
Soot or ash breathed into the lungs can precipitate an asthma attack, Hamilos 
said, and frequent exposure to fireplace smoke can increase the number of 
respiratory infections for an allergic child. 
</P>
<P>
Hanukkah candles that burn in a well-ventilated room aren't a problem, the 
physicians said, because the candles are small, burn quickly and the smoke they 
produce is not significant. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting a home where furniture is upholstered with feathers or where there is 
heavy perfume or hair spray in the air can also cause reactions in sensitive 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Parents should call ahead, ask questions and express their concerns before they 
visit and limit the child's exposure to a couple of hours instead of spending 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
Children accompanying their parents on holiday ski trips or who are visiting 
relatives in cold climates should wear a scarf over their nose and mouth to 
help warm and moisten the air. They might also benefit from an inhaled 
bronco-dilator, such as Ventolin, or a preventive medication such as Intal -- 
sodium cromolyn -- which help keep airways from constricting during exposure to 
cold air or vigorous exercise.

IMPACT OF HARRIS FELT IMMEDIATELY AT CS LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lucious Harris celebrated his 19th birthday Monday by scoring a season-high 17 
points for the Cal State Long Beach basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
A coming-out party? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. The 6-foot-5 freshman guard from Cleveland High had long since made his 
presence felt during his first collegiate season. 
</P>
<P>
Harris is averaging 10.9 points, third on the team, and has been a starter in 
all but one game. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, he has played a key role in the 49ers winning six of their 
first seven, the fastest start for Long Beach in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Against North Texas State on Monday, Harris made seven of his first nine 
field-goal attempts as the 49ers gained a 92-74 victory before a capacity crowd 
at the Long Beach gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
But that performance pales in comparison to his last-second heroics in games 
played earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
It was a Harris steal with three seconds left that led to the winning basket in 
the 49ers' 70-69 upset of Purdue on Dec. 2. Two weeks later, on the road 
against Texas, he made a three-point shot at the buzzer to pull out an 89-87 
win for Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't play like a freshman. He's cool and calm," said Bob Braswell, a 
Long Beach assistant who coached Harris at Cleveland. "The Purdue game was 
probably the best example of that. 
</P>
<P>
"We were down by two, less than a minute to play, and we called his number, set 
up a play designed for him, and he hit the shot. Then he got the big steal to 
win the game." 
</P>
<P>
Just call him Cool Hand Lucious. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who averaged 20.9 points a game as a high school senior, had his own 
plan when he accepted a scholarship offer from Long Beach last spring. But it 
didn't include starting as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping I could make the team and pick up a few minutes," Harris said. "I 
thought, maybe I could start my junior year." 
</P>
<P>
Redshirting Harris during his freshman season was briefly considered by the 
49er coaching staff, but Braswell said that option was quickly discarded. 
</P>
<P>
"He played himself out of redshirting real quick," Braswell said. "It's very 
difficult for a freshman to start on any college level, let alone Division I, 
but Lucious worked hard over the summer and really didn't leave Coach (Joe) 
Harrington a choice." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said he wasn't sure that he belonged at the major-college level until he 
scored 27 points in an intra-squad scrimmage during Long Beach's early season 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
But cracking the starting lineup? Well, that was another thing all together. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprised me a lot," Harris said. "I thought I would come off the bench." 
Or at least be riding it with a game on the line. 
</P>
<P>
"The Purdue game I was really scared," Harris said. "My stomach had a lot of 
butterflies. But when (Harrington) called the play for me I just thought, 'Put 
it down. Got to make it.' 
</P>
<P>
"Later I thought, 'Why did he call on me?' But he made the right choice, and it 
boosted my confidence a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Braswell says looking to Harris in the clutch could fast become a trend for the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's shooting the ball very well," Braswell said. "He's a slashing type player 
who can drive to the basket or hit the jump shot, and right now he's doing all 
the right things."

BANNING TOURNAMENT;

JEFFERSON GIVES GRANT A COLD DOSE OF REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach City College gym was almost devoid of human life Wednesday, 
except for some basketball players, coaches, officials and scorekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
It was cold inside too. And it was 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder then, that if one had to find a reason behind the Grant High 
basketball team's second loss in three days, it would be a lack of intensity. 
After all, how can you get psyched to play when you're freezing and wish you 
were warm in bed? 
</P>
<P>
Grant Coach Howard Levine has been a successful coach because he is a demanding 
one, however. Thus, he would brook no excuse for his team's 80-69 loss to 
Jefferson (3-8) of the Southeastern League. The loss dropped Grant's record to 
8-2 -- four days after an upset of North Hollywood pushed the team's mark to 
7-0 -- and knocked the Lancers out of the Los Angeles Invitational/Banning 
tournament. Jefferson advances to the consolation championship with the win. 
</P>
<P>
If you listen to Levine, the problem may lay in that win over North Hollywood. 
The victory propelled Grant to the top of most everyone's list of top teams in 
the Valley. But woe is the Lancer who spends too much time worrying about that. 
</P>
<P>
"If our guys start believing that we're the No. 1 team in the Valley, then 
they're gonna find out we're not the No. 1 team in the Valley," Levine said 
after the game, not hiding his disappointment. "If these guys start to believe 
their press clippings, then forget it." 
</P>
<P>
Press clippings or no, there did seem to be a lack of intensity on Grant's 
part. Granted, this is the Lancers' sixth game in seven days. Not even the 
frequent-fliers in the NBA log that many games in such a short a span. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got some real tired legs," Levine said before the game. "We're 
vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
And that could be the rub in searching for answers to the loss. Still, 
Jefferson, which Levine called a team to watch come 3-A playoff time, came at 
Grant with one of the more potent offensive weapons you'd want to see in a high 
school basketball game in 6-2 senior forward Robert Avery. The high-flying 
Avery scored 42 points and knocked down six three-point shots to consistently 
thwart any Lancer rally. 
</P>
<P>
"He just tore us up," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
But not all the Lancers somnambulated through this one. Rene de la Hoya, who is 
emerging as a bona fide star, nearly matched Avery hoop for hoop. The senior 
forward scored a career-high 34 points, making 13 of 16 shots from the field 
and eight of 12 free throws. De la Hoya scored most of his points as the deep 
man on Grant's press-breaker, taking long passes and converting the four-foot 
shots with the accuracy of a surveyor. 
</P>
<P>
Even de la Hoya could not stop Grant's slide, however. The Lancers frittered 
away a seven-point first-quarter lead and Jefferson took the lead for good, 
27-25, on an Avery jump shot with 4:34 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson took a 51-42 lead midway through the third period. Grant, however, 
persevered and, with guard Keith Weinstein adding 17 points, closed the gap to 
four at 64-60 with a little more than five minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But with 1:55 left, an Avery -- who else? -- three-point shot made it 75-64 and 
put Grant in its tomb. 
</P>
<P>
In another tournament game: 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro 93, Sylmar 74 -- Sylmar fell behind, 28-13, in the first quarter and 
had to play catch-up the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans closed the deficit to 10 at one point in the fourth quarter at 
71-61, but San Pedro's Mike Watts, who had 18 points, helped keep Sylmar at 
bay. 
</P>

VALLEY TOPS VENTURA FOR RIVERSIDE TITLE, 84-65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christine Rumfola buried five consecutive jump shots after the intermission 
Wednesday to break a tie and lift the Valley College women's basketball team 
over Ventura, 84-65, in the championship game of the Riverside tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the second half with the score tied, 51-51, Rumfola, who finished with 
21 points and made 10 of 17 shots from the field, erupted to give the Monarchs 
(11-2) a 10-point edge that they never relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
Rumfola was named to the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
It was Valley's seventh consecutive victory and the third consecutive time it 
has won the Riverside tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Valley forward Laura Kirkpatrick, an All-Southern Section player while at 
Buckley High, was named the tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkpatrick scored six points and grabbed 10 rebounds in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Sandrine Rocher contributed 16 points for the Monarchs and Ericka Miller added 
13 points and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
In another women's game: 
</P>
<P>
Pierce 77, San Diego City 56 -- Melanie Sapon scored a game-high 28 points in a 
nonleague game at San Diego to lead the Brahmas (7-8) to their third 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
MEN 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Stanislaus 95, Cal Lutheran 74 -- Brian Roscoe came off the bench to 
score all but two of his 22 points in the second half to lead Cal State 
Stanislaus and help send visiting Cal Lutheran to its 11th consecutive defeat 
without a victory in a nonconference game. 
</P>
<P>
With Cal Lutheran trailing in the second half, 49-42, Roscoe scored 16 of the 
Warriors' next 21 points over the next six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Stanislaus led, 70-51, with 9:44 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Roscoe's outburst and teammate Shawn Graham's 23 points negated a 29-point, 
six-rebound performance by Cal Lutheran guard Jeff deLaveaga. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Demeter added 18 points for the Kingsmen, who have lost 11 in a row. 
</P>

scored 21.

LISA LESLIE WINS DIAL AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morningside High center Lisa Leslie, the State Division I girls basketball 
Player of the Year as a junior, has been named female winner of the Dial Award 
as the top scholar-athlete in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie and boys winner Robert Smith of Euclid, Ohio, were chosen by a panel of 
coaches, school administrators and sports journalists from across the U.S. who 
based their votes on athletic, academic and civic achievements. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5 Leslie, aside from being a standout in basketball, volleyball and 
track, has been Morningside's class president each of the last three years and 
carries a 3.5 grade point average while participating in the high school's 
honors program. 
</P>
<P>
Considered one of the nation's top schoolgirl basketball players, Leslie led 
the Lady Monarchs (6-0) into Wednesday's quarterfinals of the Tournament of 
Champions at Santa Barbara High by contributing 19 points, 13 rebounds and nine 
blocked shots in a 76-65 win over Nevada Union on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
She was a consensus preseason All-American for Morningside, ranked No. 1 in the 
country. Last season she averaged 27 points, 14 rebounds and seven blocked 
shots a game while leading the Lady Monarchs to their first state title. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie will receive her award Dec. 20 in Washington, D.C.

<P>
Six players from Serra High topped a strong South Bay contingent on the CIF 
All-Southern Section Division VII football team selected by the First 
Interstate Bank-Amateur Athletic Foundation board of sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
Serra (14-0), which captured the division title with a 34-31 win over Lompoc, 
placed fullback Dennis Gerard, offensive linemen Kenny Thomas and Robert 
Jackson, linebacker Steven Johnson and defensive backs Clayton Lopez and Fred 
Safford on the 30-man squad. 
</P>
<P>
Five other South Bay players were selected, including two from Ocean League 
champion West Torrance. 
</P>
<P>

South Torrance tackle Robert Ferkula were named to the offensive unit, while 
West lineman Jae Kim and Morningside linebacker Danny Katoa were selected to 
the defense.

Lompoc running back Napoleon Kaufman, who rushed for 2,163 yards and scored 39 
touchdowns, including four in the championship game, was named Division VII 
Player of the Year.

HERRICK DISSATISFIED WITH BIG HART WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY In a nonleague boys' basketball game: Pal 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not many coaches would be discouraged after their team scored 95 points and 
posted a 21-point victory for its fifth win in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Hart High Coach Greg Herrick was anything but thrilled, however, after the 
Indians struggled at times during a 95-74 win over an outmatched Verdugo Hills 
team Wednesday in the Bosco Tech tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Hart will meet Venice at 8 tonight in the championship quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"We're winning, but I'm upset because I know what we're capable of doing," 
Herrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (5-2) led by as many as 19 points in the first half behind 17 points from 
6-foot-6 senior center Chad Fotheringham. 
</P>
<P>
But the scrappy Verdugo Hills team pulled within 66-56 on Scott Boudreaux's 
free throw with seven minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Hart fell back on its considerable height advantage and aggressive full-court 
pressure to outscore Verdugo Hills, 12-2, and extend its lead to 78-58 on 
Renato Rivas' layin with 5:01 left. 
</P>
<P>
"We played in spurts," Herrick said. "We'd play well for a while, then get real 
sloppy in our execution." 
</P>
<P>
But it's difficult to blame the Indians for lackluster play. After all, when 
they looked over at Verdugo Hills' pregame drills, they saw only seven players 
-- and none taller than 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Hart had a roster full of talent, including three starters taller than 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to motivate them in that kind of a situation," Herrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Fotheringham scored a game-high 22 points, Marty Downen scored 19, and Rivas 
scored 15 of his 17 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Micah Ohlman had 12 points, including three three-point baskets, before fouling 
out early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Purser scored 19 points to lead five Verdugo Hills' players in double 
figures. Tuyen Tran and Boudreaux each had 13 and Dan La and Joey Letscher 
scored 12 apiece. JEFF RILEY In a nonleague boys' basketball game: Palmdale 62, 
St. Genevieve 37 -- Chris DeGlopper scored 18 points and Jason Grimes added 14 
as the Falcons ran away with the game at Palmdale. Leading, 25-20, at halftime, 
Palmdale (5-5) outscored St. Genevieve, 37-17, in the final two quarters to put 
away the pesky Valiants.BOYS' SOCCER Harvard 2, University (San Diego) 2 -- The 
Saracens scored two first-half goals and settled for a draw in a nonleague 
match in San Diego. Mark Fein scored on a direct free kick from 19 yards to 
give Harvard (5-1-2) a 1-0 lead, and Charlie Woo's goal later in the first half 
broke a 1-1 tie. David Moran assisted on Woo's goal. University scored with 
seven minutes left in the game to earn the tie. L.A. Baptist 2, Cabrillo 2 -- 
Dan Stepper and Todd Cohen scored goals in a nonleague match at L. A. Baptist 
(6-0-2). Cabrillo (2-4-2) held a 2-1 lead in the second half until Cohen 
knocked in the tying goal with 16 minutes to play. Alhambra 6, Bell-Jeff 1 -- 
The Guards (2-1-1) lost in a first round match of the Bosco Tech tournament. 
They will play Pius X at 11 a.m. Saturday at Bosco Tech.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK;

BEAL HELPS SHORT LINEUP STAND TALL FOR CANYONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Lee Smelser, basketball coach at College of the Canyons, has moved 
6-foot-4 freshman Mike Beal into the starting lineup, it doesn't take much 
imagination to see the Cougars fielding a five-guard lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Canyons still has inside players, but the starters either play like 
guards, have the physique of guards, or both. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Tom Kelly (5-foot-9) and shooting guard Steve Valenzuela (6-2) are 
pure guards. Larry Allbritton (6-4) is listed as a guard and plays like a 
shooting guard but starts at forward if the Cougar lineup follows the 
traditional scheme of a center, two forwards and two guards. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Clark (6-3), Allbritton's running mate at forward, is in Smelser's 
estimation "really an off-guard." 
</P>
<P>
Beal replaced 6-8 center Justin Scott and grabbed 16 rebounds against East Los 
Angeles, but Beal will almost always be dwarfed by rival pivot men. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a real quick jumper, though," said Smelser, who believes he is now 
fielding his best possible lineup. "Beal is just getting better numbers now. . 
. . We've had a couple of good ballgames the last few times out." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Canyons' mighty mites have consistently been outrebounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the opponents have," Smelser said, "but that's been one of 
our weak spots . . . the ability to get the ball off a missed shot." 
</P>
<P>
Until proven otherwise, though, Canyons will continue to believe that good 
things come in small packages. 
</P>
<P>
Honor roll: Walter Briggs, a former Antelope Valley High standout, has been 
selected most valuable player on the University of Hawaii's Aloha Bowl-bound 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs, a 6-0, 195-pound senior free safety, finished the regular season fifth 
in the nation with nine interceptions and was a first-team All-Western Athletic 
Conference selection. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs was a United Press International second-team All-American selection. 
</P>
<P>
Uncommon opponents: Cal State Northridge may face better basketball players 
than Demetrius Mitchell of Cal State Hayward and Mark Hill of Cal State 
Fullerton, but the Matadors may not see many who are more exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, a 5-11, 198-pound junior from McClymonds High in Oakland, scored 19 
points, including 17 in the second half, against the Matadors. Hill, a 6-4, 185 
senior from Locke, rained down long-range jump shots on Northridge on his way 
to a game-high 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
Hill made a school-record eight of 12 three-point shots against Northridge -- 
most of them coming from well beyond the three-point line. Mitchell had two 
spectacular breakaway dunks against the Matadors that left a small crowd 
trading high-fives in the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's first dunk was a 360-degree, two-hand jam. 
</P>
<P>
And he was just warming up. The second one was a 480-degree -- one and a third 
revolutions -- right-handed stuff that sent the audience into hysterics. 
</P>
<P>
"You worry when a guy does that," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said of 
Mitchell. "It can really get a team fired up." 
</P>
<P>
Although Northridge's coaches and players were well aware of Hill's shooting 
talents, the Matador players and coaches did not expect him to shoot as well as 
he did. 
</P>
<P>
"He just went off on us," Northridge swingman Derrick Gathers said. "There was 
no stopping him. He was on fire." 
</P>
<P>
Cold customers: Kris Brodowski, starting center on the CSUN basketball team, 
had nightmarish shooting performances against Cal State Hayward and Cal State 
Fullerton last week. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-6 senior went 0 for the week in field-goal attempts. He was zero for 
nine in a 66-56 Matador victory over Hayward and missed all four shots in an 
81-70 loss to Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Brodowski started the week shooting 47.6% from the field and averaging 10.4 
points a game. Those figures dropped to 36.4 and 7.9. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Eugene Humphrey came close to matching Brodowski's frigid shooting 
against Hayward before correcting his sights against Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
After making just two of nine shots against Hayward, the 6-0 junior guard made 
eight of 10 against the Division I Titans, including six of his last seven. 
</P>
<P>
Happy hosts: Before Glendale won the championship in the Glendale tournament, 
Valley-area men's basketball teams had been better hosts than Arsenio Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's victory broke a distressing trend for Valley-area men's basketball 
teams. No other local school had won the championship of its own tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley finished third in its tournament after losing to eventual 
champion Santa Monica. Moorpark lost the championship game of the Moorpark 
tournament to San Jose City College. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale exercised the host's prerogative by putting itself in the easier 
bracket but didn't give itself any breaks by including three of the state's 
top-20 teams in the eight-school field. Glendale won the championship with an 
impressive 68-55 win over ninth-ranked Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Valley is playing host to a tournament this week, and the other Valley-area 
school, Canyons, will play host to the first Cougar Classic, Dec. 27-29.

Crandall Lobbies for Airline Deal: American Airlines Chairman Robert L. 
Crandall said his deal to buy foreign routes and other assets of Eastern 
Airlines should be approved by government regulators "in the national 
interest." Failure to allow the deal would invite greater control of 
international air travel by foreign carriers, Crandall said at a press 
conference called to discuss details of the $471-million purchase. The complex 
deal with Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., gives American control of 
Eastern's prized Latin Anerican routes and would greatly enhance American's 
presence in foreign markets. The purchase is subject to review by the Justice 
and Transportation departments and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court overseeing 
Eastern's Chapter 11 reorganization.

Babwa Wawa Goofs?: Barbara Walters lunched in New York this week with House 
Speaker Tom Foley, his wife, Heather, and with ABC brass, including Sam 
Donaldson. Making polite conversation at a lull, Walters asked, "And Mr. 
Speaker, how's your dog?" Foley smiled politely and said, "She's dead." 
Donaldson was convulsed with laughter because he knew that Foley's 16-year-old 
Belgian shepherd, Alice, died earlier this month. Foley quickly covered for 
Walters by telling a joke.

* Jackie's Sacred Ground: Jacqueline Onassis and the Wampanoag Indians are 
close to settling a dispute over a 264-foot strip of Martha's Vineyard 
beach-front property. Agreement may be reached early next year, said Paul 
Sulla, an attorney for the Wampanoag. "There have been negotiations but we're 
not quite there yet," said Onassis attorney Brian Hurley. Onassis bought a 17% 
interest in the land in 1980. Since then she has waged a court battle over the 
remaining land, which is surrounded on three sides by her 380-acre retreat. But 
descendants of the island's original settlers want to keep their share of the 
beach because they say it is sacred.

* PG Only: Shocker sentences start an article by Garry Wills, in the Dec. 21 
issue of New York Review of Books. "Of all the men running for President in 
1988, only two were forced, by the birth dates of their children, to admit to 
having had sex with their wives before marriage and those two, Pat Robertson 
and Jesse Jackson, were the only preachers in the race. To some, that might 
seem odd; but not to those who know preachers. The pulpit has always been a 
libidinous zone."

* Talking Ed: Actor Edward Asner, in Boston Tuesday, teamed with the Boston

In her View commentary the other day ("All I Want for Christmas Is a Minute's 
Peace"), Megan Rosenfeld described the seasonal frenzy that drives women "way 
out into the ozone." 
</P>
<P>
She called it "Christmas stress" and suggested that it afflicts women more than 
men, because men tend "to walk around thinking Christmas is something in the 
distant future," while women go crazy trying to get everything done. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfeld's scenario certainly fits our house, except that she didn't mention 
one factor that has complicated Christmas for us this year. I mean cats. 
Rosenfeld mentioned cats only as a metaphor for the Christmas syndrome: "It 
feels like a hot cat sitting on your chest, threatening to suck the breath out 
of you like a vacuum cleaner." 
</P>
<P>
The cats in our Christmas are real. They are not on our chest. They are on our 
front porch. They are five wild cats, though one has been tamed, which only 
adds to our frustration. My wife feeds them every morning. 
</P>
<P>
They are a motley mother cat, her three black kittens, and the tame one -- an 
orange male my wife took in from a previous wild litter, and, with great 
patience, tamed to the point where he can be picked up, if he's in the mood. He 
is tame only in a limited sense. He is mean, pugnacious, selfish, solitary, 
recalcitrant and greedy. He is part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that we are trying to catch the mother cat and the three kittens 
(now several months old) to have them neutered. It's the only defense we have 
against yet more litters. 
</P>
<P>
My wife rented a trap for $3 a day. It is made of steel wire and sheet metal, 
about four feet long, and looks like the Wright brothers' first airplane, with 
flip-up doors at either end and a spring plate in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
First you have to get the cat in the box. When it steps on the spring the doors 
slam shut. We lured one of the black cats into the box with a bit of mackerel. 
It made a terrible furor, screeching and whirling about and sticking its legs 
out through the webbing. My wife drove it down to the vet. She had to leave it 
overnight. We assumed the vet would tranquilize it with a shot before 
operating. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a male," he told my wife. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you know?" she asked. We had never known. 
</P>
<P>
He told her. Specifically. 
</P>
<P>
We had bought three collars to mark the neutered cats. The next day she brought 
the cat home; it wore a red collar. We baited the box again, but no luck. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll pick one up and stuff her in it," I told my wife. 
</P>
<P>
With the box open nearby I reached down and grabbed one of the black cats by 
the middle. It turned into a ball of fury. It dug its claws into my hands and 
wrists. I dropped it. Immediately the blood spurted from half a dozen wounds. 
The cat fled. 
</P>
<P>
Miraculously, a second black cat ventured into this infernal machine and we 
trapped it. The noise the cat made was demoralizing. 
</P>
<P>
When my wife went to pick it up the next day, she could hear it yowling. The 
vet had given it a name. Noisy Cat. It was a male. 
</P>
<P>
We have yet to capture the other black cat or the mother. The tame male 
compounds the problem because he has no fear of the trap. But we don't want 
him. The mother cat came into the house the other day and we slammed the door. 
She had never been trapped inside before. 
</P>
<P>
In her panic she put on a show that was galvanizing. She ripped along the 
window sills, riffling the metal shutters. She leaped up on tables, scattering 
objets d'art. She scooted through the rooms. She hid under the bed. She tried 
to jump through the windows. We threw the door open and finally she streaked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
We have yet to catch the third black cat. My wife thinks it is a male too. I 
don't know why. Meanwhile, she is trying to address 300 Christmas cards, wrap 
presents, do her shopping, dress for parties, microwave our dinners, pay the 
bills, carry out the trash and do all the other chores of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
We have no hope of ever catching the mother cat. 
</P>
<P>
Merry Christmas.

YOUR COINS: MONROE COMMEMORATIVE HOLDS SPECIAL INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have two Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollars, uncirculated. On 
one side it says Monroe Doctrine Centennial, 1823-1923 and Los Angeles. The 
flip side has profiles of Monroe and Adams. I also have some $1 silver 
certificates. What are my coins and bills worth? -- C.H.A. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: United States commemorative coins are a favorite with many collectors, 
and it is a challenge to assemble a complete set. High-grade specimens are 
often difficult to locate and can be quite expensive. 
</P>
<P>
In the commemorative series, the Monroe issue is particularly interesting on 
several accounts. For one, the Monroe Doctrine forged a cornerstone in American 
foreign policy that remains relevant in today's headlines regarding Central and 
South America. But it took a considerable stretch of the imagination to mark 
the centennial in Los Angeles. Apparently this was accomplished by early 
Hollywood press agentry and Congress went along with it. 
</P>
<P>
Another Hollywood touch is the design of North and South America on the 
reverse. Both continents, on close examination, depict female figures. And, 
while the doctrine bears President James Monroe's name, the profile of John 
Quincy Adams shares the obverse, because it was he who developed the policy of 
opposing European encroachment in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
There were 274,000 silver Monroe pieces minted, and many are believed to have 
been circulated during the Depression. Prices for uncirculated Monroe halves in 
Mint State 60 condition are worth $35 and up. Coins graded MS-65 are quite rare 
and bid for about $6,250. 
</P>
<P>
As for your $1 silver certificates, unless they are crisp and uncirculated, 
they have little or no collector value. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Recently a bank gave me a new $1 bill that contained several 
printing/cutting errors including: an unusual paper cut (not a rectangle but 
more like the number 1, absence of any print on one-fourth of the face of the 
bill; and the serial number and seal printed on the back or reverse side of the 
bill. Whom can I contact to get an authoritative value? I have gone to four 
local dealers, and the prices they quoted me varied from $5 to $250. Why the 
significant variation in value? All of the dealers seem to be interested, but 
unsure of the value. Is there any recognized authority for printing errors on 
bills? -- A.V. 
</P>
<P>
A: The reason there's such a price range for your error bill is that collectors 
for such material are as scarce as some of the bills. Also, there are so many 
different kinds of errors that pricing gets quite complicated. I suspect that 
the dealer who offered you the top price has a customer for such a bill. The 
other dealers are speculating that they can place it with someone and turn a 
profit. My sources tell me that your bill is probably in the $50 to $75 range. 
</P>
<P>
There are several pricing guides for bills that may prove helpful. The House of 
Collectibles publishes all sorts of guides. The "Official Blackbook Price Guide 
for U.S. Paper Money" is in its 21st edition. The price is $4.95. There's also 
the "Standard Catalogue of United States Paper Money" by Krause and Lemke. It 
contains a small section on errors. Also available is "Paper Money of the 
United States" by Robert Friedberg. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am interested in finding information about the U.S. 3-cent nickel and 
silver series. Could you recommend some sources? -- S.C.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: Most general-interest coin reference books will touch on these coins. A more 
detailed description is given by Q. David Bowers in "United States 3-cent and 
5-cent Pieces, an Action Guide for the Collector and Investor." 
</P>

Coin News 
</P>
<P>
Bullion coins have gained considerable popularity in the marketplace. Carving 
out its own niche is Mexico's silver Libertad (pictured), sometimes called an 
onza. The Libertad was first issued in 1982, although Mexico has a long history 
of silver coinage. MTB Banking Corp. of New York has been named worldwide 
distributor, but the coin is widely traded and available at most coin stores. 
The 1989 Libertad sells for about $8. Common dates are available for about $7, 
but some of the early issues had low mintages and carry a hefty premium.

Feedback 
</P>
<P>
The recent mention of California fractional gold brought this response from 
J.T. of Santa Paula: 
</P>
<P>
"Collecting these little gems is like acquiring small pieces of California Gold 
Rush history . . . . An estimated 15,000 authentic specimens exist of which 
there are more than 600 varieties. Each variety is relatively scarce with no 
more than 200 known specimens of the more common . . . . The largest collection 
of varieties (451) ever assembled was that of Ed Lee and his son, Kenneth. The 
collection was sold in September, 1988, by Superior Galleries and brought 
approximately $325,000. The Defiant Eagle quarter dollar brought $44,000, the 
highest price paid for a California fractional gold piece . . . . Anyone 
interested in pursing California fractional gold as a hobby should . . . 
consider joining the Society of Private and Pioneer numismatics, which 
publishes the semiannual Brasher Bulletin. Dues are $15 a year. The address is 
P.O. Box 4423, Davis, Calif. 95617-4423.

LEGAL VIEW: SEXUAL HARASSMENT CAN BE COSTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the week of holiday parties, and the holiday cheer brings with it 
questions of legal risks and liabilities. Two quickly come to mind: liability 
for furnishing alcoholic beverages and sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, a series of California court cases created new law by imposing 
liability on social hosts who served alcoholic beverages to their guests. If 
the guest left the party intoxicated and subsequently injured someone in an 
automobile accident, the host could be sued for his negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Those cases were overturned in a 1978 statute that expressly says, "no social 
host who furnishes alcoholic beverages to any person shall be held legally 
accountable for damages suffered by such person or for injury . . . or death of 
any third person resulting from the consumption of such beverages." 
</P>
<P>
In the years since, there have been various court cases interpreting the 
statute, but by and large, it still essentially stands intact, so that legal 
risk for a party host who serves alcoholic beverages is relatively minimal. The 
same cannot be said for possible cases of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent newsletter, the Century City law firm of Goldstein &amp; Kennedy, 
which specializes in representing management in labor matters, reminded its 
clients that the perils of sexual harassment loom large during holiday 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"Simple acts such as hugging, close dancing, kissing under the mistletoe, and 
other forms of affection . . . can be construed as sexual harassment," the firm 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
Sexual harassment "is one of the most serious problems that females face in the 
work force," says Charles H. Goldstein, the firm's senior partner and the 
narrator of a videotape called "How to Prevent Sexual Harassment Lawsuits," 
which is sold to businesses for $79.95. 
</P>
<P>
What is sexual harassment? First, it is unwelcome sexual advances or physical 
or verbal conduct of a sexual nature. Second, the conduct must be tied to an 
employment decision, such as hiring or promotion, or it must unreasonably 
interfere with work performance or create a hostile work environment. 
</P>
<P>
Even off-color jokes can constitute legal sexual harassment. If you're not sure 
whether it's a joke that should stay in the locker room, Goldstein has an easy 
test: Is it a joke you would not be embarrassed to tell in a courtroom to a 
judge and jury, with your spouse and family sitting in the audience? It it 
doesn't pass that test, don't tell the joke, he says. 
</P>
<P>
If you feel you are a victim of sexual harassment, you should report it to a 
key company executive, perhaps even in writing, Goldstein advises. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't ever just give in, in silence. Get to somebody in the organization who 
will investigate." If the company is not responsive, then file a complaint with 
the state Fair Employment and Housing Department, or the federal Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein advises his clients to have a clear policy that defines sexual 
harassment, how cases will be investigated and what penalties will be imposed 
on violators. Complaints should be reported to a neutral person, and both a man 
and woman should be available. Never take a "boys will be boys attitude" toward 
sexual harassment, he advises in his videotape. 
</P>
<P>
There is substantial potential legal liability for the organization and the 
individual who allows or joins in sexual harassment -- legal fees, damages for 
pain and suffering and lost wages, punitive damages, as well as loss of 
employee productivity and morale. A sexual harasser, not just the employer, can 
be personally liable for these damages. 
</P>
<P>
These legal risks simply reinforce common sense: Don't allow the festivities of 
the holiday to get out of hand.

10: GARDENING BOOKS; 
</P>
<P>
THIS LIST MAY PLANT SOME IDEAS FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The perfect gift for a gardener might be a gardening book, but not just any 
book. Though there are hundreds of books on gardening, many, if not most, are 
inappropriate for gardeners living in California. 
</P>
<P>
Our climates and soils are different from those on the East Coast, and, more 
importantly, from those in England, where most gardens books are authored. Some 
of these might as well be written in a foreign tongue -- they talk about things 
such as "liming the soil" (which would have disastrous results in California) 
or "hardiness" (ability of a plant to survive the bitter cold of an Eastern 
winter). 
</P>
<P>
They rarely address some of the biggest problems of California gardeners, such 
as irrigation or how much water a plant needs. And some of our best plants, 
such as gazanias and agapanthus, are not included in their lists of the best. 
Instead you'll find peonies and lilacs, poor choices for a California garden. 
</P>
<P>
So a list of the best garden books for Californians must begin with books 
written in California. These may not be the best of garden literature, or the 
prettiest, but they offer sound and useful advice, and any photographs will 
picture plants we can actually grow. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunset Western Garden Book," Joseph F. Williamson, Editor (Lane Publishing, 
Menlo Park: $22.95). This may be old news for experienced gardeners, but the 
"Western Garden Book" is the bible of California gardening, used by 
professionals including landscape architects and nurserymen, though designed 
for the home gardener. Even experienced gardeners may not know that there is a 
new (fifth) edition, published in 1988, which includes many additional plants 
and some new cultural information. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, though it may not seem as if there could be any new way to dig a 
hole, there is, according to the fifth edition, and it is radically different 
at that. 
</P>
<P>
The front of the book is full of precise and pithy garden culture, with 
sections on soils, planting techniques, watering, fertilizers, pruning, 
propagating, tools, pests and diseases, and weeds. There are charts listing 
plants best suited to a particular job -- the best plants for shade, the best 
ground covers for a slope, or the best trees for a patio, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
The key to this book, however, is the map up front, which divides Southern 
California (and the rest of the West) into various climate zones. Detailed 
enough to divide Santa Monica into two zones, the map helps explain the 
differences between gardening in the San Fernando Valley and the L.A. basin, at 
the beach or in the mountains, and even the high desert. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the book is a big plant encyclopedia. After each plant it shows the 
zone for which it is most appropriate, as well as a description, small drawing 
and information on how to grow it. The fifth edition also tells something about 
each plant's water needs. 
</P>
<P>
"Western Home Landscaping," by Ken Smith (HPBooks, Tucson: $10.95). This picks 
up where the Western Garden Book leaves off -- explaining in clear language how 
to put a landscape together, from soil preparation to laying bricks, building 
fences and patios, lawns, irrigation and the like. There are plans and plenty 
of photos, and the author even estimates what the costs might be. Ken Smith is 
a practicing landscape architect in Southern California, so the information is 
especially appropriate. He is also one of the pioneers of drought-resistant 
landscaping, and the book addresses this timely subject. 
</P>
<P>
"Designing and Maintaining Your Edible Landscape Naturally," by Robert Kourik 
(Matamorphic Press, Santa Rosa: $16.95). This is the definitive work on growing 
fruits and vegetables, and it leaves no stone unturned. This is not a casual 
work; thoroughly researched and thought out, it shows the author's years of 
experience in California. Not many pretty pictures, but lots of charts, plans, 
graphs, drawings and other meaty stuff for the serious (and even scientific) 
gardener. 
</P>
<P>
"The Principles of Gardening," by Hugh Johnson (Simon &amp; Schuster, New York: 
$17.95). This is an English coffeetable book -- now available in paperback -- 
that is so insightful (and so wonderfully written) that many use it as a 
textbook in gardening classes. It is neatly divided into two-page sections that 
can be digested along with a morning sweet roll or evening snack. Sections on 
garden paths, hedges and color tactics are especially useful. Many plants are 
also listed, but this information is very English and not terribly helpful for 
Californians. Lots of pretty pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"Trees and Shrubs for Dry California Landscape," by Bob Perry (Land Design 
Publishing, San Dimas: $22.50) and "Trees and Shrubs for Temperate Climates," 
by Gordon Courtright (Timber Press, Portland: $45) are two books full of color 
photographs of plants we can grow (both authors are Californians). They're not 
spectacular photos but very useful because you can quickly see how big a plant 
gets, what shape it grows into and what color the foliage and flowers are. 
There are also descriptions of each plant. These books are especially useful 
for those trying to plan a garden, or those trying to identify something 
already growing in the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"Tropicals," by Gordon Courtright (Timber Press, Portland: $35.95) is a new 
photo reference (the author calls it a "visual dictionary") that illustrates 
and describes all those plants that are tropical in appearance, if not in fact. 
We can grow most of these, but because they are so seldom shown in gardening 
books, they are not often considered when it comes time to pick a palette of 
plants for the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"The American Horticultural Society Encyclopedia of Garden Plants," Christopher 
Brickell, Editor (Macmillan, New York: $49.95). This is a brand-new book 
containing about 4,000 color photographs of garden plants. Not all will grow in 
California, so check the "Western Garden Book" before becoming too attached to 
any one plant. The true value of this book is in its sheer size and the way all 
the plants are arranged -- first by type (large shrubs, perennials, etc.), then 
by color of the flowers -- which makes it most useful for planning and 
reference. 
</P>
<P>
"Color in Your Garden," by Penelope Hobhouse (Little, Brown, Boston: $35). By 
England's most prolific garden writer, this elegant and beautifully illustrated 
book is also just about the only one on the subject of using color in the 
garden, a tricky task. Much thought has gone into her discussions of why blue 
flowers look best here, or red flowers there. Although you may never be 
completely satisfied with color schemes, this book will help you make more 
intelligent decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Garden Style," by Penelope Hobhouse (Little, Brown, Boston: $40.). Inspiration 
will be your chief benefit from this gorgeous coffeetable book. While the 
information may not be useful for Californians, the book contains a great 
variety of photographs -- from extremely formal gardens to completely natural 
schemes. For those looking for landscape ideas, or simply for a kick in the 
pants that gets them outside and into the garden, this is the ticket. 
</P>

Good garden books are not always easy to find; one garden-book specialist is 
V.L.T. Gardner, mail order or by appointment, on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.

Hindsight being the best kind of vision, the husband-and-wife authors recall 
with 20/20 clarity their own successful methods in raising two lovely 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Where did they go right? Dividing their chapters into topics such as setting 
limits, "time out" to resolve unfriendly exchanges, holding family conferences, 
practicing consistency and following through are some of the familiar tenets of 
this pleasant book. 
</P>
<P>
As young parents, they once took their toddlers to a fancy restaurant after a 
full day at Hearst Castle, resulting in cries and whimpers. A similar disaster 
at Disneyland taught them to limit excursions to only an hour, entry price 
notwithstanding; they learned too, and pass on the suggestion, not to stage 
elaborate birthday parties, recalling when their 4-year-old guests failed to 
open a pinata filled with melting Snickers bars. 
</P>
<P>
College-educated parents may find most of the Golants' advice on the 
featherweight side, but Chapter 7, stressing the importance of positive 
reinforcement, holds insight for moms and dads of all backgrounds. ROSELLE M.

DESIGN: THE SECOND PHASE OF ESCONDIDO'S CIVIC CENTER COMPLEX APPEARS TO HAVE

<P>
The problem of designing a large theater has challenges similar to those in 
creating a convention center: A boxy large space must somehow be concealed 
within a graceful shell. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Arthur Erickson, using bold repetitive forms in concrete, has made 
the gigantic new San Diego Convention Center a fine piece of design. His 
excellent exterior detailing makes this building attractive to those arriving 
by car or foot. It's a landmark project for downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Architects Moore Ruble Yudell have not been nearly as successful in their 
design of the second phase of Escondido's Civic Center, a $55.4-million complex 
that will include 1,500- and 400-seat theaters for stage productions, an arts 
complex and a community meeting center. 
</P>
<P>
The final design for the project, to be built in Grape Day Park downtown, site 
of the new City Hall completed in 1988, was unanimously approved by the 
Escondido City Council this month. The city hopes to break ground next fall, 
with completion expected in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Although the architects have created wonderful outdoor spaces, the bulky 
100-foot-tall "fly tower," which houses the mechanical equipment above the 
stage, sticks out like a sore thumb, unbroken by architectural detailing or 
other visual devices that could make it attractive. Other potential problems 
include jarring combinations of roof treatments and a confusing variety of 
window and wall treatments used in an attempt to break down the mass of he main 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a possibility that the Civic Center complex will have 
insufficient daytime attractions such as food stands or recreation 
opportunities to make the park a success as a people place. 
</P>
<P>
Months of refining should have resulted in a well-composed treatment of the big 
box that will house the necessary stage equipment over the main theater; at 100 
feet, the "fly tower" will be the Civic Center's most noticeable feature. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the theater, at least as depicted in model form, will sit hard by 
Escondido Boulevard, its bulk unbroken by details that could tie it to the rest 
of the Civic Center complex. Its flat roof, for instance, sets it oddly apart 
from the pavilion and gable roofs used on the other of the new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Project architect Renzo Zecchetto said that softening the impact of this 
looming box was the architects' single toughest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The designers elected to place most of the design interest at the middle level 
of this and the other buildings in the second phase of the Civic Center 
project. Groups of small windows, varied wall angles and assorted architectural 
detailing will break these facades into forms a human being can get close to 
without feeling overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and community leaders have expressed a desire for some softening 
of the theater's stark appearance. Suggestions include a screening wall in 
front of the building's prominent northern face, detailing on the building wall 
itself or a system of vine-covered trellises and palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
Zecchetto said the architects favor the last approach, partly because it is 
most economical. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage of the design game, though -- when at least a year has already 
gone into the project -- one expects a more polished design solution. 
</P>
<P>
Other aspects of the architecture are also disappointing. The choice of roof 
forms is puzzling. Some roofs will have the traditional pitched form, while 
others, as on a few small towers, will be flat. The flat towers don't always 
merge well with the slanted roofs nearby. It is difficult, though, to make a 
final pronouncement on these. The material has not been chosen, and these could 
make the actual buildings look much different from cardboard models. Flat tiles 
or a seamed metal are among the choices being considered. 
</P>
<P>
There is other evidence the architects did not arrive at a consistent, coherent 
design vision: Pedestrians will not notice from the ground level, but there is 
something jarring about the way the big theater's northern wall drops from a 
flat roof on top to a slanted roof above the first floor, with twin buttresses 
flying above it. 
</P>
<P>
It is at the level of the pedestrian, in fact, that the architects appear to 
have done their strongest design work. 
</P>
<P>
All along, the design of the entire Civic Center complex, including City Hall, 
has been driven by its situation in the 17-acre Grape Day Park, a huge open 
space in the heart of the city. The intention was always to keep this setting 
park-like, even with the addition of several buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Moore Ruble Yudell put their buildings at the edges of the property, near the 
streets, preserving the interior as open space. A walk through the complex 
should prove to be an interesting stroll among the various plazas and 
courtyards. 
</P>
<P>
The main entrance to the new theater complex will be off Escondido Boulevard on 
the western edge of the project. Here, a wide plaza of slightly ascending 
levels will lead pedestrians in between the large theater to the north and the 
nearby community theater, set behind a pergola at Escondido Boulevard and 
Valley Parkway. The pergolas, along with many rows of trees, will soften the 
experience of entering the complex. 
</P>
<P>
The pergolas here and elsewhere are the same sort of vine-covered 
column-and-trellis walkways that became the trademark of legendary San Diego 
architect Irving Gill early in this century. Some modern architects even use 
arches like the ones Gill favored. 
</P>
<P>
In the Civic Center project, every building has at least one courtyard related 
to it, and most have several. Some are intended to be used for various 
gatherings. A courtyard off the back of the smaller theater could, for example, 
become an outdoor performance space, Zecchetto said. He said that he hopes that 
the city will eventually have the money to add doors to the back of this 
theater's stage so that it can open onto the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the architecture, a larger concern has to do with the programming of 
the Civic Center complex -- the kinds of uses selected for this public park. 
The City Hall and theaters will dominate the site, with the community meeting 
building and arts complex as secondary uses. What will the new complex offer 
the person who comes to the park in search of a recreational or cultural 
experience during daylight hours? 
</P>
<P>
A library might have been a good choice, but the city just built a new one 
three blocks away at 2nd Avenue and Kalmia Street in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
There are now no concrete plans for the kinds of things that make Balboa Park 
so successful: food pushcarts, small cafes, and many 
</P>
<P>
choices of exhibitions, performances, films and museums. 
</P>
<P>
Both Zecchetto and Rolf Gunnarson, assistant executive director of the 
Escondido Community Development Commission, say they have considered such 
ideas. A small food outlet and bar in the lobby of the larger theater might be 
open during daylight hours, and a kitchen in the community meeting building 
could be used to produce food for park visitors as well as for those attending 
meetings at the building. Food vendors are also a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
These kinds of people-oriented things will be essential to animating the 
well-planned outdoor spaces, which will undoubtedly be the new complex's 
triumph.

THERAPY TURNS ON LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I would like to have more information about the type of light 
treatment given to people who are depressed. Everything I've read about it 
explains that these patients are exposed to light. If that's all there is to 
it, why can't they just sit at home in their living rooms with the lights on? 
Why is it necessary to have doctors if it's that simple? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Light therapy for the treatment of the condition known as "seasonal 
affective disorder" is somewhat more complicated than sitting at home with the 
lights on. Patients undergoing this form of treatment generally spend at least 
an hour a day sitting about three feet in front of rows of fluorescent tubes. 
The tubes provide a light intensity approximately equal to that of outdoor 
light shortly after sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
From two to three weeks of such therapy may be required before symptoms 
disappear, but some improvement may be seen within two to four days; this 
compares with the three weeks that are needed when patients are treated with 
antidepressant medication. Light treatment must be continued for these 
patients; otherwise, the symptoms recur within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Light therapy is an experimental procedure. It should not be attempted without 
professional supervision.

Nominees Named for American Music Awards: Bobby Brown, Soul II Soul and Paula 
Abdul led a pack of dance-oriented artists that dominated the nominations 
Wednesday for the 17th annual American Music Awards. Vocalist Brown and British 
R&amp;B outfit Soul II Soul each got five nominations, while dance-pop diva 
Abdul, rapper Tone-Loc and pop duo Milli Vanilli all took four. Brown was 
nominated as best male vocalist and his "Don't Be Cruel" as best album in both 
the pop/rock and soul/R&amp;B categories. The winners will be named during a 
live, three-hour ABC telecast from the Shrine Auditorium on Jan. 22. The 
awards, considered an indicator of the more prestigious Grammy Awards to come 
later in the spring, are based on votes cast by the public. The oddest 
nomination: the Traveling Wilburys as best new artist. The grouping of George 
Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and the late Roy Orbison represents 
a combined total of about 120 years of pop history. CLAUDIA PUIG

Soviet Acrobats Sub for Peking Troupe: ThePeking Acrobats, who were to have 
performed Jan. 31 at El Camino College's Marsee Auditorium, were refused exit 
visas and they will be replaced on that date by the Soviet Acrobatic Revue. 
According to International Attractions Inc., the Peking troupe's U.S. tour was 
canceled due to the current political situation in the People's Republic of 
China. Tickets for the Peking Acrobats will be honored for the Soviet 
performance. CLAUDIA PUIG

CHRISTMAS FEASTS; 
</P>
<P>
THE LAST THING ANYONE EMBROILED IN NORMAL CHRISTMAS DAY FESTIVITIES NEEDS IS TO 
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING A HUGE HOLIDAY DINNER ON THE TABLE. THAT'S WHY IT'S 
WISE TO CHOOSE A MENU BUILT AROUND FOODS THAT REQUIRE ONLY A MODICUM OF 
ATTENTION WHILE THEY COOK.

If ever a celebration meal was served under duress, it is Christmas dinner. By 
the time it is ready to serve, the initial excitement of opening gifts and 
playing with new toys and games has wound down and hunger pangs are rife. But 
in all likelihood, the family cook has had to somehow get it all together with 
children, family and guests all happily underfoot or teeming in and out of the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Whether one does all the cooking and planning or settles for a family potluck, 
there's a lot of work behind every successful Christmas dinner. But the fun of 
having family and friends together to celebrate the occasion is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
With turkey so much in the limelight at Thanksgiving, and since it appears so 
often on our tables during the year these days, why not choose something very 
different for your Christmas menu this year? A rack of lamb, separated into 
double chops and served on a bed of barley mixed with pine nuts, raisins, an 
orange and mint leaves will make a welcome change. 
</P>
<P>
Or, you might like to consider serving a juicy Christmas goose stuffed with a 
dried fruit and chestnut-flavored bread dressing. If you want a large goose, 
one big enough to serve a crowd, you may need to ask your butcher to order it 
for you. For the photo appearing with this story, however, we had little 
trouble finding a 15-pound goose. A couple of telephone calls quickly located 
the large goose in the frozen foods section at one of the major markets. 
</P>
<P>
Another elegant centerpiece to consider for a wonderful celebration dinner is a 
boned and stuffed leg of lamb. Fresh spinach leaves, onion, garlic and oyster 
mushrooms are used in the delicate stuffing for this aromatic holiday roast. 
</P>
<P>
A more traditional Christmas menu might feature a standing beef rib roast. 
Serve this one with old-fashioned Yorkshire pudding and a rich mushroom-laden 
brown gravy. 
</P>
<P>
Still other suggestions for an easy holiday menu include a succulent ham served 
with Quick-Glazed Sweet Potatoes or possibly a lean and flavorful pork roast 
served with baked apples. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever you choose to serve for your holiday meal, we hope it's a happy one 
for you and yours. 
</P>
<P>

TRADITIONAL KOSHER PRODUCTS APPEAR POISED TO COMPETE WITH 'IN' FOODS; 
</P>
<P>
TRENDS: THE STRICTLY PREPARED FOOD IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY POPULAR WITH A 
LARGER NUMBER OF NON-JEWISH CONSUMERS.

<P>
Can it be that kosher food has become trendy? Can traditional Jewish cooking 
that depended for oh-so-many years on brisket, blintzes and borscht really 
compete with the likes of such bona fide "in" cuisines as Southwest and Thai? 
</P>
<P>
Sounds improbable, but the word from those who deal in kosher foods is a 
qualified yes. 
</P>
<P>
Product variety and availability have exploded, kosher mavens note, gourmet 
kosher restaurants now serve top quality Continental, Oriental, Mexican, Indian 
and other non-traditional dishes, and upscale hotels are investing big money to 
compete for kosher catering dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Even kosher wines, long-disdained by connoisseurs as far too sweet and syrupy, 
now compete with premium non-kosher wines. The 1986 Alexander Valley Cabernet 
Sauvignon produced by Gan Eden, a small, kosher winery located in Sebastopol, 
Calif., has just taken top honors in its category in Wine&amp;Spirits 
magazine's 1989 American Wine Champion competition. The award is one of 
three-dozen medals won by the label over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
"The last decade has seen kosher go from relative obscurity tucked away in a 
corner of the market to the level where often more than one-third the products 
on a market's shelves are kosher," said Menachem Lubinsky, president of New 
York-based Lubicom, a leading kosher marketing firm. 
</P>
<P>
However, only a small fraction of that amount -- about $1.5 billion -- is 
actually spent by Jews who follow their faith's complex set of dietary laws 
known in Hebrew as kashrut, Lubinsky pointed out. "That's an indication of how 
much the kosher market extends beyond observant Jews," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like sushi," added Marvin Pearlman, president of A1 International Foods 
in Los Angeles, the largest kosher food distributor west of New York. "Non-Jews 
eat kosher food because they think it's exotic." 
</P>
<P>
The Northeast, with its large Jewish population, is the nation's prime kosher 
market. Southern California, however, has quietly slipped into second place in 
the kosher sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
There are now nearly 40 kosher restaurants in Los Angeles scattered over the 
area from downtown to the west San Fernando Valley (these should not be 
confused with kosher-style restaurants, such as Canter's on Fairfax Avenue). 
</P>
<P>
One of Los Angeles' better-known kosher restaurants is the Milky Way run by 
Steven Spielberg's mother, Leah Adler, on West Pico Boulevard. Just down the 
street are China on Rye and Pepe Tam, which offer kosher Chinese and Mexican 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, such upscale hotels as the Beverly Hilton and Century Plaza are 
finding that a larger proportion of their catering is kosher. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty-percent of our total catering business is kosher, and it goes up every 
year," said Carlo Karim, food and beverage director at the Beverly Hilton 
Hotel, which recently spent $600,000 to install a kosher kitchen complete with 
its own dish-washing area, refrigerators, ovens and food preparation tables. 
</P>
<P>
At the Century Plaza Hotel, catering director Jim Ries said that as much as 50% 
of the hotel's non-convention catering is now kosher and that "it has increased 
dramatically in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
"Eating kosher has become a fad in Los Angeles," said Rabbi Aryeh Weiner, who 
keeps tab of the West Coast kosher scene for the Union of Orthodox Jewish 
Congregations, the largest of the many rabbinical watchdog groups that certify 
products as being kosher. "Because of that, kosher consumerism in Los Angeles 
is far ahead of anywhere else in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the strongest indication yet that Southern California is now big time 
in the kosher world came last weekend with the staging of the International 
Jewish Festival at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Previous festivals have 
been held the past few years in New York and Miami, but this was the first time 
the kosher foods expo was staged on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, which ended Monday and drew more than 20,000 people, according to 
event organizers, featured more than 40 kosher food producers. Included were 
such food industry giants as Borden's, Post Cereals and H.J. Heinz, which 
became the first national brand to cater to kosher consumers when it introduced 
canned, kosher vegetarian baked beans in the mid-1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Other booths touted kosher restaurants and caterers and one firm that builds 
kosher kitchens complete with three sinks to insure that meat, dairy and 
neutral, or parve, foods do not unintentionally come in contact with each other 
in violation of kosher guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Kosher regulations, which are based on biblical passages and later rabbinical 
interpretations, are extremely complex. A quick rule-of-thumb to remember is no 
pork, shellfish or the mixing of dairy and meat no matter how minute the 
quantity. Also, to be kosher, fish must have scales and wine or grape juice 
must come from Jewish sources. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to the convention center provided a convincing lesson into the changing 
nature of kosher foods. Goat cheese, frozen pizza, Middle Eastern spicy salads, 
Chinese fortune cookies, Italian wines, Mexican-style sauces and dips and even 
a chocolate-flavored desert pasta competed for attention. Just a few years ago, 
none of these items were available to kosher consumers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more dramatic signs that kosher food has changed was the booth 
manned by Alan Kapalinsky, president of Mendel's Haymish Brands of Brooklyn, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
There to be sampled were what appeared to be three of the kosher world's 
best-known no-no's: crab, lobster and shrimp. To avoid any possible confusion, 
however, Kapalinsky markets the products (made from pollack fish seasoned and 
shaped to resemble the real thing) under his "It's Not Crab," It's Not 
Lobster," and "It's Not Shrimp" brand names. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the thought of this being the real stuff is too much for some religious 
Jews," said Kapalinsky. "This is a very emotional product for those that keep 
kosher. Some feel they are happy to have the taste. Others feel they shouldn't 
even like the taste." 
</P>
<P>
Despite -- or perhaps because of -- the controversy, Kapalinsky said the "It's 
Not . . ." line has doubled its sales volume each of the past three years. He's 
also done well enough to attract the attention of competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Empire Kosher Poultry, the nation's largest supplier of kosher chicken and 
turkey products, is about to come out with "Tovafish," which will also taste 
like shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
A major reason for the broadening of the kosher palate epitomized by the 
introduction of "It's Not . . ." and "Tovafish" is the growing number of 
younger Jews who have become kosher after years of eating non-kosher foods. A 
second factor is that greater exposure to the non-kosher world has prompted 
even some people who have always kept kosher to try more exotic tastes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the kosher market is simply reflecting the general market," said Gil 
Marks, editor and publisher of the Kosher Gourmet Magazine, a 4-year-old, 
bi-monthly magazine with a national circulation of 10,000. "The general 
American consumer is less xenophobic, more willing to try other ethnic cuisines 
and more concerned about taste and quality. 
</P>
<P>
"The same holds for the kosher consumer." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Jews, Muslims and Seventh-day Adventists also regularly buy kosher 
foods because their religions have dietary codes that are in some ways similar. 
Additionally, vegetarians and people with allergies to dairy or shell fish seek 
out kosher brands because they know by-products that are often hard to trace to 
their source will be clearly identified in processed kosher goods. 
</P>
<P>
And despite traditional kosher cuisine's reliance on fatty and sweet 
ingredients, health food aficionados also gravitate toward products market 
kosher. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception is that kosher foods are so carefully watched that the 
heckhsher (kosher certification symbol) is like a Good Housekeeping seal of 
approval. People equate this close supervision with quality control and 
healthier ingredients," said Lubicom's Lubinsky. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperidge Farms public relations executive Ann Davin agreed. "Non-kosher 
consumers see the kosher symbol and think quality. That symbol alone carries 
weight, and because it does it often gives a product an edge in the fight for 
supermarket shelf-space," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Pepperidge Farms "went kosher," as Davin puts it, two years ago, the 
company has upped sales by as much as 15% in areas where Jews are concentrated 
and where non-Jews tend to be familiar with kosher products, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether adherence to kosher standards insures a healthier product is 
debateable, however. Rabbis concerned with monitoring kosher products say their 
priority is Jewish law, not health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"A label that says something is kosher doesn't make it healthier," noted Weiner 
of the Orthodox Union. "What it does mean is that what the label says is 
absolutely accurate, be it junk food or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
The only kosher foods -- aside from specially prepared low-calorie, 
low-cholesterol or low-salt products -- that are generally healthier than their 
non-kosher competition, Weiner and others said, are meat and poultry raised, 
slaughtered and processed according to kosher guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Katz, vice president of sales and marketing for Pennsylvania-based Empire 
Kosher Poultry, said that unlike much of the non-kosher poultry industry, his 
birds are never fed growth stimulants, hormones or artificial ingredients to 
avoid internal organ defects that would render them non-kosher. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Yale Butler, who writes a kosher food column for his Los Angeles weekly 
newspaper, the B'nai B'rith Messenger, explained that soaking and salting 
kosher meats using only cold water and the draining of all blood also insures 
that kosher meats will have lower bacteria counts, a safeguard against 
salmonella and other food-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"The rabbis reject what the government often passes as safe, healthy meat," 
Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the extra level of supervision required for kosher foods also means 
higher prices. Jack Kotlar, the owner of Kotlar's Kosher Market in the 
Pico-Robertson area, said meat, poultry, cheese and other products that need 
special handling or ingredients to be certified kosher can cost twice as much 
as their non-kosher competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, the number of kosher consumers in Los Angeles has increased 
tremendously. "In 1975 when I opened, there was nothing here. Now at least 
seven kosher markets have opened up within blocks of me in the last half-dozen 
years," he said. "The competition has become fierce."

DEAR SOS: Could you print a recipe for peach Melba. I had a recipe once, but it 
has disappeared from my files. 
</P>
<P>
 -- FAY 
</P>
<P>
DEAR FAY: It's always a pleasure to resurrect classical old recipes, especially 
for holiday entertaining. Peaches Melba, named after Nellie Melba, an 
Australian diva during the turn of the century, whose voice inspired a chef to 
create the dessert of ice cream and peaches, makes a wonderfully simple yet 
elegant dessert for any dinner party. 
</P>
<P>

up in individual dessert dishes. Place scoop of ice cream in each peach half. 
Top with raspberry sauce and sprinkle with almonds. Makes 6 to 7 servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I had clipped, saved and used the Rancho Bernardo Inn's Walnut Bread 
recipe numerous times, and suddenly, when I looked for it again, it was gone. 
I've exhausted the usual hiding places so now I am appealing to you. (Do these 
ragged clippings perhaps sneak away to a rest home for worn out recipes?) 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARGE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MARGE: They certainly do. We have files filled with these missing recipes, 
so we are happy to report that Rancho Bernardo Inn's Walnut Bread was not among 
the missing -- or retired.

BACK TO BASICS: TAKING THE LUMPS OUT OF GRAVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Good gravy -- easy words to use as an expletive, but a sauce that many cooks 
find difficult to prepare. It needn't be so if you understand the three basic 
steps: degreasing, deglazing and thickening. 
</P>
<P>
Pan gravy begins with drippings, rendered when meats and poultry are sauteed, 
broiled, roasted or browned. Once the meat or poultry is cooked, remove it from 
the pan (Step 1), then degrease the drippings by one of the following methods: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pour the juices into a measuring cup designed for this purpose (Step 2), 
with the pouring spout located near the bottom so the juices may be poured off 
after the fat rises to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tip the pan and use a basting tool to siphon the juices from beneath the 
fat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pour the juices into a heat-proof glass container and submerge it in cold 
water so the fat rises to the top and may be spooned off. 
</P>
<P>
Set the fat aside. Add enough water to the remaining drippings to measure two 
cups (stock, milk, cream, wine or beer may be substituted, if desired). Deglaze 
the roasting pan by gradually pouring this liquid back into the pan (Step 3), 
simmering over low heat and scraping up any brown bits off the bottom of the 
pan with a wooden spoon. 
</P>
<P>
Place three tablespoons of the reserved fat in a saucepan (Step 4). Sprinkle 
three tablespoons flour over the fat and blend into a smooth roux with a wire 
whisk or wooden spoon (Step 5). Cook over medium heat three to five minutes, 
stirring occasionally, to rid the flour of its raw starchy taste. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually add the liquid from the roasting pan (Step 6) and simmer, stirring, 
until the gravy thickens. Continue to simmer about 15 minutes, stirring 
occasionally and adding more water as necessary. Strain before serving, if 
desired.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: MAKE KITCHEN FESTIVE FOR HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I put up holiday decorations all over the house, but the kitchen 
always was left out. Since it's the activity center of our home, I had to keep 
the decorations simple, but I came up with a cute idea. 
</P>
<P>
I keep a small towel hanging on the door of the refrigerator for hand wiping, 
so I bought guest towels in red and green with Christmas motifs to use during 
the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
I also changed the magnets on the front of the refrigerator to some with 
Christmas symbols, and taped paper snowflakes on the cabinet doors. Now the 
kitchen is festive too. 
</P>
<P>

DEAR READERS: Winter may mean fewer fresh salad vegetables in the supermarket, 
but in their place you'll find the wonderful winter squashes. If you're not 
already familiar with these delicious, nutritious vegetables, here are a few 
tips about the different types to help you start enjoying them. 
</P>
<P>
The most widely available varieties are golden and green acorn squash, named 
for their acorn shape. Both are moist and have a nut-like taste; the golden are 
a little sweeter than the green. Buy green squashes that are dark gray-green 
with orange spots and golden ones that are a gold-orange without spots. 
</P>
<P>
Golden nugget squash is bright orange and looks like a tiny pumpkin about the 
size of an apple. That makes them just the right size for individual servings. 
They have a delightfully sweet taste. 
</P>
<P>
Butternut squash looks like a small gourd, pale golden-beige in color. They 
have a creamy, buttery-nutty flavor and the smaller ones are sweeter than the 
larger. 
</P>
<P>
Buttercup squash looks like it's wearing a light green turban. The body of the 
squash is a dark green with lighter stripes and grayish flecks. The flesh is 
slightly drier than other squashes, but still sweet and smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Our favorite is spaghetti squash. When cooked, it fluffs up into long, 
spaghetti-like strands. The larger the squash, the thicker the strands. Its 
mild flavor blends beautifully with any sauce, much like pasta does. Choose a 
spaghetti squash that's bright yellow or whitish-yellow. 
</P>
<P>
Buying and storing squash is really easy. Look for squash without blemishes and 
that feel firm; those that are heavy for their size have meatier insides. 
Because of their hard shells, winter squash will keep for up to three months if 
you store them in a cool, dark, well-ventilated place. Those with the stems 
still attached will stay fresh the longest. 
</P>
<P>
Cooking is easy too. They can be baked, boiled or steamed, and do great in the 
microwave, sliced or whole. Their sweet flavors make them great accompaniments 
for spicy meats. They can be served plain with a little butter or included in 
recipes for everything from side dishes to desserts. The seeds can be roasted 
and eaten for snacks or on salads and provide protein. 
</P>
<P>
All squashes are excellent sources of vitamins, especially A, and minerals. Add 
these nutritious treats to your menus for a change and enjoy the winter a 
little more. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I hate to waste anything, so when lettuce looks a little limp, 
instead of throwing it out, I just remove the outer leaves, break it into 
quarters or large chunks and soak it in cold water for about a half hour. It'll 
be crisp and fresh again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- T.M.C.L., Washington 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I like my family to have a hot, nutritious breakfast every 
morning, but with all of us on different schedules, and mornings very hectic in 
our house, it wasn't always practical or even possible. Now I have a microwave 
oven and it's easy. 
</P>
<P>
On weekends I take time to cook extra amounts of pancakes, waffles, French 
toast, muffins, bacon and sausage. I freeze individual servings of each, then 
on busy mornings the kids and my husband can just "zap" their favorite 
breakfast and have a good, hot meal to start the day. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JAN, Greensburg, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I'm accumulating more and more special cooking utensils -- 
slotted spoons and skimmers, wire whisks, strainers and more -- that are too 
large or bulky for my kitchen drawers. I put up a pegboard painted to match my 
kitchen decor and hung it on the wall. Now there's no storage problem, the pegs 
can be moved to make more room as I need it, and it gives my kitchen a really 
high-class look. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CAROL, Sacramento 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My sister has a simple but wonderful idea. She keeps her large 
kitchen sponge in the top shelf of her dishwasher. It's out of the way, easily 
reached and gets cleaned every time the dishes are washed. It always smells 
clean.

COLLEGE, SCHOOL WORKERS TO VOTE ON SCRAPPING MERIT SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Classified employees in the Glendale Unified School District and at Glendale 
Community College are seeking to abolish the merit personnel system, a process 
similar to civil service that is intended to protect the interests of workers 
but has instead become the target of bitter complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The school district's classified employees -- clerks, maintenance workers, 
managers and others who are not certificated as instructors or administrators 
-- are to vote in late February on whether to abolish the merit system and 
return all authority over hiring, promotion and transfers to the district's 
Board of Education. Employees there have described the current system as 
cumbersome and Neanderthal. 
</P>
<P>
A similar referendum is expected to occur early next year at Glendale Community 
College, where officials soon will verify the validity of employee petitions 
calling for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
The two votes could bring an end to the merit systems by June 30 and affect 
more than 1,250 classified employees who work in the two districts. 
</P>
<P>
Classified employees say the system, designed to expedite job appointments and 
to provide an objective grievance process, has done just the opposite, 
frustrating them and handicapping school operations in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the three-member personnel commissions that administer merit 
systems meet briefly only once a month, know little about employee issues and 
are unresponsive to workers. Often the personnel commissioners who sit on the 
boards "rubber stamp" the recommendations of the personnel director instead of 
making independent, objective decisions, critics charge. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the merit system say that despite its shortcomings it is the best 
way to make sure that hiring and promotions in school districts and colleges 
are fair. They argue that if boards of education are given unquestioned 
authority over personnel matters, employees will miss out on having an 
disinterested body to review complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there may be some misperceptions about how the system works and what 
guarantees would be lost if they were to throw the system out," said Don 
Hanson, a Los Angeles attorney recently appointed as a Glendale Community 
College personnel commissioner. "I don't think there's any guarantee to 
employees that if the merit system goes, there is any particular system they 
can expect to have." 
</P>
<P>
But Mary Meehan, a computer programmer for the school district and president of 
its classified employees' union, said: "We really feel like there's been a 
message delivered here -- that people aren't happy with the status quo. The 
bottom line is, it can't get any worse than it has been." 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Board of Education was informed Tuesday that the referendum on the 
merit system has been scheduled for Feb. 23 through March 1. A simple majority 
of votes would terminate the system, administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
The college Board of Trustees is to determine Jan. 22 whether community college 
employees garnered enough signatures on their petitions to call for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Merit systems became popular in the state more than 60 years ago as a way to 
address flagrant patronage problems in schools' personnel practices, according 
to Lee Alarid, personnel administrator for the Los Angeles County Office of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale school district adopted its system in 1966, and the community 
college followed suit two years later. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the three-member personnel commission oversees hiring procedures and 
promotions and hears employee grievances. The members, who are appointed to 
serve three-year terms, are not answerable to a school board or superintendent 
and appoint the district's personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
"In theory, it sounds very good," said Jeanne Rees, a library clerk at GCC who 
has helped lead the fight against the college's merit system. "It was brought 
in to make job testing and appointments fair. But I think there's some inherent 
flaw in the system. I've never seen it work out." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, employees say, the job application process is cumbersome and 
time-consuming. As a result, weeks may pass before vacant positions are filled 
or promotions are considered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's asinine what you have to go through to get a job here," said Bobbie 
Brundige, a school district account clerk and chairwoman of the Committee for 
Responsible Personnel Practices, which led the campaign to abolish the merit 
system. She called the system "Neanderthal." 
</P>
<P>
Employees contend that the advent of state education codes, labor laws and 
collective bargaining have brought broad protections for classified workers, 
and thus have rendered the merit system redundant and obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
Of 700 school districts statewide that enroll enough students to be eligible 
for a merit system, about 100 have one. Of about 106 eligible community 
colleges, only six still use the system, education officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have now is a system based on a certain set of conditions that existed 
almost 60 years ago," said Alarid, the personnel administrator. "We're talking 
about a time period that was a completely different world." 
</P>
<P>
The school district's system has been under fire from employees for several 
years, said Meehan, who has worked there for 19 years. Dissatisfaction peaked 
earlier this year, when Brundige's committee waged an aggressive petition 
campaign to abolish the system. About 606 employees of 1,006 on the district 
payroll signed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At Glendale Community College, the Equitable Personnel Practices Task Force in 
four days gathered signatures from about 56% of the college's 250 classified 
employees. They were required to collect only 40% to call a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of both the college and the district said they want their respective 
boards of education, which now handle budget issues affecting classified 
employees, to take over personnel matters as well. As elected officials, board 
members would be more responsive to and knowledgeable about employee concerns 
and demands, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
But merit system advocates warned that such a change would not necessarily lead 
to more acceptable handling of personnel matters. They warn that its 
termination could leave classified employees unprotected and their interests 
unrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly think the taxpayers are getting their money's worth by having the 
merit system for protection," former Glendale Community College Personnel 
Commissioner Carol Ross said.

TESTS BEGIN ON NEW GAS SYSTEM AT LANDFILL; 
</P>
<P>
TRASH: A SPORTS COMPLEX MAY REOPEN AT SCHOLL CANYON IF THE METHANE-COLLECTION 
APPARATUS WORKS AS WELL AS GLENDALE OFFICIALS EXPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Testing began Monday on a gas-collection system that Glendale officials hope 
will allow the reopening of a tennis complex and golf course on the inactive 
portion of the Scholl Canyon landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The sports complex was closed more than a year ago after potentially dangerous 
methane gas leaks were detected. Public Works Director George Miller said he 
was thrilled and hoped the installation of the system would end the city's feud 
with the Air Quality Management District over the correction of the landfill's 
gas-emission problems. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD threatened at several hearings this year to fine the city $25,000 a 
day for operating a substandard gas-collection system. Glendale officials 
contended that they needed to keep their old system operating while they 
installed the new one or the gas leaks could get out of control. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to comply with the AQMD's demands, the city in October stopped 
burning collected methane in its flare system and redirected the gas to flares 
operated by the AQMD in the active portion of the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The city, meanwhile, filed a lawsuit last month in Superior Court against the 
agency, maintaining that the AQMD's conditions for the installation of the 
gas-collection system were too strict. The AQMD imposed a Dec. 29 deadline on 
the installation of the new system. "That's what our goal was, and we made it," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Tests conducted last year revealed that the old system broke down when its 
horizontal gas-collecting pipes collapsed as a result of the gradual settling 
of waste in the landfill, which is more than 245 feet deep in some areas, 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The new $709,000 system, Miller said, was installed last week by Valley Crest 
Landscaping Co. and is being tested to make sure it meets all AQMD 
requirements. "We need to do some more work on it, but it's in and its 
working." 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials said they are encouraged by the news but have yet to verify that 
the new system is in place and operating in compliance with its standards. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased that the gas-collection system has been upgraded to the point 
where it is now," said Robert Pease, the AQMD's engineering manager in charge 
of supervising the Scholl Canyon project. "But we are currently in the process 
of verifying that the gas emissions do not exceed our standards. Once we get 
that information, we'll have a better handle on the efficacy of the system." 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD evaluation should be completed in early January, Pease said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that no date has been set for reopening the tennis courts and golf 
course but that the city is working toward that goal.

PASADENA PLANS DRUG-FREE ZONES NEAR SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In August, when Pasadena Board of Directors member Chris Holden tried to find a 
relative's house in Elizabeth, N.J., he found instead a bustling, drug-dealing 
avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"It was rather narrow, cars were stopping, and people were sticking out of the 
cars dealing drugs," Holden recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Guiding his own car carefully through the street, Holden, accompanied by his 
brother, Reggie, avoided eye contact with the dealers, hoping to stay out of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Then suddenly, in another block, the dealers disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing," Holden said. "It was kids out riding bicycles and I'm 
seeing these signs saying, 'Drug-Free Zone.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena director had stumbled upon a tactic touted as the cornerstone of 
New Jersey's 2-year-old, anti-drug effort. The white signs, with blue letters 
spelling out "Drug-Free Zone," mark off areas 1,000 feet around schoolyards. 
Individuals caught dealing drugs inside these zones face mandatory prison 
sentences of three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
With added officers on regular patrols in the zones, New Jersey reported 6,509 
arrests last year under the new law and 4,700 during the first half of this 
year. Dealers know the state is serious and respect the boundaries, New Jersey 
officials say. As a result, they say, the streets surrounding schools are 
washed clean of curbside dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Holden, elected in March on an anti-crime platform, returned to Pasadena, 
determined to start drug-free zones here using a similar California law. During 
the fall, he advanced the idea through a board subcommittee that included 
Director Bill Paparian and Mayor William Thomson, also known for his anti-drug 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
It was Thomson who last week publicly unveiled the plan for the creation of 
drug- free zones, as part of an anti-drug and alcohol-abuse package. The Board 
of Directors on Tuesday formally endorsed the concept of declaring drug-free 
zones in Pasadena. When the board adopts specific anti-drug legislation next 
year, Pasadena could become only the second city in California to declare such 
zones, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But successful drug-free zones involve more than just the posting of signs, 
Holden said Tuesday. Cooperation also must come from residents of drug-infested 
neighborhoods, police officers who make arrests there and prosecutors who file 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson agreed, saying: "Signs by themselves will be helpful, but they are not 
going to win the day." 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena officials will enlist the help of the Pasadena Unified School 
District, the city attorney and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's 
Office in devising its drug-free zones. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for such zones originated four years ago with revisions to the U.S. 
Health and Safety Code, which called for a one-year minimum prison term for 
those convicted of selling drugs, such as heroin, marijuana, hashish, cocaine, 
PCP (also known as "angel dust") or LSD within 100 feet of playgrounds and 
video arcades and within 1,000 feet of schools. 
</P>
<P>
The law's effectiveness was hampered, however, by the quantities of drugs 
required to be seized before the added charges could be filed. As a result, 29 
states enacted their own legislation. 
</P>
<P>
California's year-old version applies only to convictions for the sale of rock 
cocaine, also known as crack, and only for sales that occur within 1,000 feet 
of a schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
Among states that have enacted such legislation, New Jersey has led the way in 
aggressively using drug-free zones to fight dealers. The New Jersey zones were 
created as part of a broad, statewide anti-drug effort devised in 1987 by Gov. 
Thomas Kean and former State Atty. Gen. Corey Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
A statewide action plan that accompanied the legislation requires all New 
Jersey cities to conduct regular police patrols in their drug-free zones. In 
Elizabeth, that meant city officials had to add seven more officers to the 
narcotics squad, said Elizabeth Police Director Joseph Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
Once arrests were made in the zones and convicted dealers were sent to prison, 
other dealers realized the state was serious and began to avoid the zones, 
Brennan said. However, it took some time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a deterrent, but it's a long-term effect," he said of the signs. 
</P>
<P>
Much of New Jersey's success with its drug-free zones can be attributed to the 
state's unique, hierarchical political system, said State Assistant Atty. Gen. 
Ron Susswein. The governor appoints the state attorney general and state 
prosecutors who oversee local police chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
In other areas across the nation, using school zones as an anti-drug tactic is 
not nearly as organized or aggressive, Susswein said. Neighboring New York 
state counted only 10 prosecutions last year under its drug-free zone laws, he 
said. Meanwhile, only a few cities, such as Omaha, Neb., and a few states, such 
as Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, have gone to the trouble of actually 
posting drug- free zone signs to accompany their laws. 
</P>
<P>
Alameda, in Northern California, is the only city in the state to post such 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
Reasoning that most streets in the small city of 75,000 would fall within 1,000 
feet of a schoolyard, the council in November, 1988, simply posted the 
drug-free zone signs at the city's four entry routes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely symbolic," said Cheryl Mitchell Wade, an assistant to the city 
manager. "We haven't added any additional resources." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, signs are not posted. But periodic high-profile, citywide 
sweeps by undercover law-enforcement officers are undertaken, in which both 
federal and state laws are used against those arrested. In October, 1988, one 
such operation netted 83 arrests. Another 177 people were arrested last June. 
</P>
<P>
But generally, the use of drug- free zone laws is left up to law- enforcement 
agencies handling the cases. John Perlstein, who oversees the filing of cases 
in downtown Los Angeles for the county district attorney's office, estimates 
that 1%, or 130, of the estimated 13,000 felony drug cases filed each year 
downtown include added penalties for dealing near schoolyards. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pasadena office, where about 2,000 felony narcotics cases are filed 
annually, head filing deputy Jim Simpson could recall using the new California 
law only once. 
</P>
<P>
But Simpson said police agencies fail to request the added penalties when they 
send cases to the district attorney for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"I see an (arrest) address, and I don't know if it's 1,000 feet within a 
schoolyard," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, said Perlstein, is that no coherent program exists to take 
advantage of the drug-free zone laws on the books. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty fragmented in Los Angeles County," he said. "We have 70 different 
police departments with separate prosecuting jurisdictions." 
</P>
<P>
Those problems will be addressed as Pasadena works out the details of its 
proposal with the school district, the Police Department and the district 
attorney's office, Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "My feeling is that in a couple of years from now, you'll find more 
and more cities involved in it."

<P>
The blue-eyed blonde gazes longingly into her boyfriend's eyes as he caresses 
her face during a romantic dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, clutching her canary yellow cap in one hand and swinging her 
sunglasses from the other, the woman heads for the beach before playing cards 
with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
These scenarios are stock shots for fashion magazines, but they caused an 
uproar last year among prospective buyers of a line of clothing called 
"Avenues," produced by Camarillo-based Everest &amp; Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? Members of the disabled community believed the company -- a major 
manufacturer of wheelchairs -- was using able-bodied models in its glossy 
catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
"Their first accusation was that our models weren't disabled because they look 
too good," said Gay Dawson, general manager of the company's year-old clothing 
division. "They complained we were portraying something glitzy and attractive 
when life isn't that way." 
</P>
<P>
However, she said, the company hires only professional models who are disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to acknowledge our consumer is legitimate," Dawson said. "We wanted 
to appeal to them the same way fashion magazines appeal to the able-bodied -- 
by hiring professional models." 
</P>
<P>
For its efforts, Everest &amp; Jennings recently received an "outstanding 
employer" award for using wheelchair models in its advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The recognition was given at the 12th annual awards program of the Media Access 
Office, a Los Angeles group that works as a liaison between the disabled 
community and the entertainment and media industries. 
</P>
<P>
But Everest &amp; Jennings has drawn notice for more than its hiring practices. 
Its clothing is specially designed for the wheelchair dresser, and is 
fashionable as well -- a rarity in a market that usually has downplayed style. 
</P>
<P>
Pants, skirts, shorts and dresses are cut to fit a seated figure, allowing 
extra seat room for comfort but not bunching in the front. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the skirts and pants have full-length zippers along the sides or at the 
crotch to allow easier access when going to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Jackets and shirts are pleated at the back of the shoulder to allow the person 
wheeling a chair more mobility. 
</P>
<P>
And above all, clothes are designed to stay clear of the wheels. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been helped immeasurably this year by suggestions from the 
models it hired to display products in its first catalogue, Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
Media Access originally helped Everest &amp; Jennings get in touch with the 
models. Because the group's name appeared in the first catalogue, it also bore 
the brunt of the disabled community's initial indignation over the polished 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'These people are too good-looking,' " said Media Access spokesman 
Joe Jackson. "And the letters came from the disabled community." 
</P>
<P>
The response was so extreme that in its spring-summer catalogue, Avenues 
included a letter affirming that the models were disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Most companies that produce wheelchairs, clothing and other accessories for the 
disabled don't even consider using disabled models in their advertisements, 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We find it offensive that they would take someone who walks, stick them in a 
chair and think that only people who walk are attractive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many disabled models are dismayed by the preference of advertisers 
and casting agents for the able-bodied. 
</P>
<P>
"They think you should settle for being happy you're alive, working on 
computers, staying at home and being very religious," said Ellen Stohl, a 
25-year-old Avenues model. 
</P>
<P>
Stohl has hardly done that. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, she became the first disabled woman to do a photo layout in Playboy. 
She lectures nationwide about sexuality for the disabled, models for different 
companies, and has captured a role in a play to be produced this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Even when she does get jobs, Stohl said, people who see her portfolio -- full 
of pictures of her riding horses, sitting in trees and looking over cliffs -- 
believe she looks too "normal" to be disabled. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'No, you can't be in a wheelchair because you're young, attractive 
and vibrant,' " she said. "Are we supposed to look like the Elephant Man before 
we can be disabled?" 
</P>
<P>
As part of her effort to change the images of the disabled, Stohl will join 
three or four other models to endorse Avenues clothing next year. They will 
consult with the company on fashion, and will represent Avenues at appearances 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Stohl said she thought Avenues had not quite caught up to current fashion. 
However, she said the company is beginning to fill a much-needed void. 
</P>
<P>
Stohl ran into problem finding clothes after a car accident nine years ago 
broke her neck in five places. 
</P>
<P>
She rejected the boxy, dull clothes targeted for older wheelchair users. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Stohl said she squeezed into too-tight pants that she had worn before 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
When she went on dates, she worried that a trip to the bathroom would take two 
hours by the time she removed her garments and then re-dressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everest &amp; Jennings Avenues is functional and fashionable," she said. "Just 
because we have different needs doesn't mean we have different desires." 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has manufactured wheelchairs for 55 years, started the 
Avenues line last year after a marketing study indicated that the disabled 
thought their clothing needs had been neglected. 
</P>
<P>
Few companies produce clothes that are made to fit the needs of wheelchair 
users. Those that do often produce clothes that are institutional, lacking 
fashion flair, Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
Avenues offers a broad range of choices, from gold lame evening clothes to 
tailored gray business suits to casual jeans. 
</P>
<P>
The clothes look like everyday outfits when worn, but their special features 
are easily noticed on the hanger. 
</P>
<P>
Waistbands are at least partially elasticized to stay in place during movement 
and transferring. 
</P>
<P>
No pockets are found at the waistband, where a seated person has difficulty 
getting out a wallet, but rather are placed on the top of the thigh or 
unobtrusively behind the calf. 
</P>
<P>
Pant legs are extra long so they don't ride up on the front, and some are extra 
wide to make it easier to conceal and change a leg bag -- a container holding 
urine from a catheter. 
</P>
<P>
And garments are made out of lightweight cottons in smooth weaves with no major 
seams, back pockets or rivets that might cause irritations or skin ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which turns out about 110 different items, is still in the process 
of learning what its consumer wants. Recently, it developed a pair of 
wide-legged, fully zippered slacks after customers complained that it was 
difficult to find pants that would accommodate full-leg braces. 
</P>
<P>
Avenues plans to release a line of children's clothes this fall. And Dawson is 
researching shoe manufacturers to find a woman's pump that can adjust to the 
swelling that comes from poor circulation and constant sitting. 
</P>
<P>
Business has doubled to about 5,000 customers in the last year, with thousands 
of requests pouring in for catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
But the mail does not stop there. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson said she has received several thank-you letters asking "where the 
company has been for the past 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
She regularly gets pictures of clients in their Avenues outfits. And since the 
confusion over the catalogue was cleared up, both Avenues and Media Access have 
received many letters from clients wanting to know if they too can serve as 
models. 
</P>
<P>
"People see the catalogues in doctors' offices and write to us," Jackson said. 
"They say, 'I never thought I could do that, or that I was attractive enough to 
do that.' " 
</P>

MALIBU GROUP SUES TO FORCE CITYHOOD VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: INCORPORATION BACKERS WANT AN APRIL VOTE. THEY SAY THE COUNTY BOARD 
OF SUPERVISORS HAS VIOLATED A STATE LAW BY DELAYING A DECISION ON AN ELECTION 
DATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Saying their patience has worn thin, Malibu cityhood backers filed a lawsuit 
this week aimed at forcing the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to set 
an April election to let voters decide whether the seaside community becomes an 
incorporated city. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we've done the only thing left for us to do," said Walt Keller, 
co-chairman of the 1,000-member Malibu Committee for Incorporation, which filed 
the suit along with the Malibu Township Council. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, accuses the 
supervisors of violating a state law that allows them 60 days from when they 
began hearing the cityhood matter to conclude the hearing as a final step 
before setting an election. The supervisors took up the issue Oct. 19, but 
voted 4 to 1 last month to indefinitely postpone a decision until construction 
permits are issued for a Malibu sewer system that the county wants to build. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana, whose district includes Malibu, through a spokesman 
issued a terse statement concerning the lawsuit, saying, "We expected it." 
</P>
<P>
The law gives the supervisors 60 days to conduct the hearing, and an additional 
30 days to set an election date, barring protests from at least 50% of Malibu's 
8,300 registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Control Over Sewers 
</P>
<P>
However, Assistant County Counsel Bill Pellman described the law as "directory, 
not mandatory," and said the supervisors are under no obligation to abide by 
such a timetable. 
</P>
<P>
"We think they (cityhood supporters) are looking at the law in a very narrow 
manner, and that our own legal advice is sound," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Graham Ritchie, a lawyer for the incorporation group, called the county's 
position "absolutely ridiculous," and accused the supervisors of "complete 
disregard for the rights of Malibu residents." 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood supporters, many of whom have long opposed the county's sewer plan as 
a recipe for widespread development, see incorporation as their best chance to 
wrest control of the sewer system from the county. 
</P>
<P>
In approving a bid by Malibu residents to vote on cityhood, the Local Agency 
Formation Commission in May stipulated that the county be allowed to retain 
control over the sewer system for up to 10 years after incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
However, county officials, fearing that a newly elected Malibu government would 
mount a legal challenge to that provision, want to make sure that a sewer they 
consider adequate is under way before Malibu residents vote on cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the 20-square-mile city would stretch from Topanga Canyon to Leo 
Carrillo State Beach along Pacific Coast Highway and nearly one mile inland. 
About 20,000 people reside within the proposed city's borders. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Dana blamed the delay on the California Coastal Commission, after 
it approved a sewer plan that opponents said would result in a sewer system 25% 
to 40% smaller than what the county had insisted upon. County officials have 
said it could take a year before the commission approves the construction 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood backers argue that to delay the vote further is unreasonable. They 
have long accused the supervisors of holding the 2-year-old incorporation 
effort hostage to the county's imposing a sewer system.

JOBS: VENTURA COUNTY EMPLOYEES MAY BE SOON 'TELECOMMUTING,' WORKING FROM HOME 
AND COMMUNICATING VIA PHONE, FAX AND COMPUTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
William Moore of Simi Valley recently cut his 45-mile commute into downtown Los 
Angeles to less than 45 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of scrambling into his car and onto the freeway, two days a week Moore 
strolls down the hallway to his part-time work space. There, he says he burns 
quickly though his work stack during uninterrupted mornings. Without the hubbub 
of office activity, he has the quiet he needs to think, a necessity in his job 
with the Citizen's Economy and Efficiency Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to discipline yourself," said Moore. "But once that's accomplished, 
it's great. I'm more productive. I have more time to spend with my family. And 
I feel better without that hassle of commuting." 
</P>
<P>
Moore and 150 others like him who work for Los Angeles County are 
telecommuters. Since the beginning of a still-growing program that started in 
September, they do their work from home part of the week. They serve as a model 
for Ventura County, which hopes to have a telecommuting plan for some of its 
5,000 employees by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The telecommuters represent what officials and futurists say will be an 
integral part of the solution to clogged freeways and brown skies in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"It is part of the wave of the future," said John Campbell, president of the 
Los Angeles branch of the World Future Society and a telecommuting consultant. 
"On the very short term, in five to 10 years, this will be very widespread. 
Almost every major employer in the country is looking at this now." 
</P>
<P>
The benefits to employees and their supervisors alike are significant. Surveys 
from large private companies and a two-year pilot program among California 
state employees show that workers want the program to succeed, so they produce 
more, claim less sick time, and generally put out more energy. They report 
feeling less stress from fewer commutes; and they feel more important because 
they have their supervisors' trust. 
</P>
<P>
Their part-time absence from the office allows other employees to share work 
space, so more work is done in less room. The surveys also show that with 
minimal expense, the employer provides a benefit that helps in both recruiting 
new employees and retaining them, something the low-paying public sector 
desperately needs when competing with private industry for personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Telecommuting also eases traffic troubles and reduces air pollution by removing 
cars from the road. That helps employers meet the requirements of Ventura 
County's Rule 210 and Los Angeles County's Regulation XV, which require 
employers to provide workers with incentives for reducing the number of times 
they drive alone to work. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't solve this problem of traffic and air pollution unless you get 
people to move in non-traditional ways," said Ventura County Supervisor James 
Dougherty. "Roads are like jails; as soon as you build them, they're full." 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty and County Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg appointed a 
committee this month to plan the move. Among the county departments that would 
be candidates for telecommuting are data processing, planning, budgeting and 
the Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get less, but more productivity," Wittenberg said. "The taxpayers 
will benefit and so will employees." 
</P>
<P>
Specialists in the field say telecommuters typically have jobs that involve 
analysis, research and development, reports or other kinds of writing, 
budgeting, typing, architectural drawing or drafting, and computer functions 
such as programming or graphics. Some who can't take advantage of these 
programs work in the service industry, on assembly lines and in health care. 
</P>
<P>
Telecommuters are not top management or low-level workers who require a lot of 
supervision. And in Los Angeles County, supervisors don't want to include 
parents of unsupervised preschool children -- too much of a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
Not all telecommuters stay away from the office two or three days a week. Some, 
like Greg Stewart, a systems analyst for GTE at its Thousand Oaks office, 
commute from West Los Angeles most weekdays. His telecommuting comes into play 
in the middle of the night, when he fields emergency calls from the company's 
Sacramento data center. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked for the company before telecommuting was widespread," said Stewart, 
one of GTE's 400 employees who telecommute statewide. "In those days, we had a 
Marina del Rey center, so I would get up and go in there. Now I've cut out the 
hassle of leaving the house." 
</P>
<P>
Employers have little to lose and much to gain, said Carol Nolan, sales support 
manager of Pacific Bell's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
"Employees think of it as a benefit even though it doesn't cost the company 
anything," said Nolan, whose company has 1,500 people telecommuting statewide. 
"This is one of those things you can't stop." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan exaggerates slightly when she says there is no cost. Employers must 
invest in training if they want a successful program, cautions Jack Nilles, the 
rocket scientist turned consultant who has coordinated programs for Pacific 
Bell, the state of California, and the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Employees need tips on how to manage their time, and supervisors must learn to 
manage people who are out of sight. Employees must be evaluated not by where 
they work, but what they do, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The telecommuters may know what they're doing, but the poor manager is sitting 
there thinking, 'Oh my God, I'm going to get canned because all my employees 
are at the beach.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nilles points to the events following the Oct. 17 San Francisco earthquake. 
With no training, preparation or screening to determine which people were best 
suited for telecommuting, hundreds of Bay Area residents began working at home 
full time. Many later reported feeling isolated and complained of too many 
distractions, and supervisors were unsure about how to handle an invisible work 
force, Nilles said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to training costs, employers may have to pay installation costs for 
telephones or computers in employees' homes, as well as long-distance phone 
bills, Nilles said. 
</P>
<P>
Nilles believes those dollars are well spent. 
</P>
<P>
"For every dollar an employer puts into training and telephone bills, you'll 
make back $6 or $7 in increased productivity, employee retention, decreased 
sick-leave time, less room for office space, etc.," Nilles said. "The most 
expensive part up-front is the training, and we see employers getting their 
money back in one to two years, and in some cases, in three months." 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, officials are pleased by those prospects, but still view 
telecommuting as an experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"The answer is not in the technology, but in the political will to do it," said 
supervisor Dougherty. "We're big enough to have an impact, but small enough to 
back out if we have to."

HOLLYWOODLAND GROUP ACTS TO PRESERVE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE PROPOSAL THEY SUBMITTED TO THE CITY RESTRICTING DEVELOPMENT 
WAS LOST IN A SHUFFLE OF PAPER WORK. BUT A RESIDENTS GROUP HAS RALLIED UNDER A 
NEW LEADER AND EXPECT ACTION ON THE PLAN BY NEXT SUMMER. 
</P>

<P>
Hollywoodland resident Bruce Mahler decided to fight the proposed construction 
of three houses on the steep down-slope behind his house when he realized the 
development would be virtually inaccessible to emergency equipment if a fire 
broke out in the tinder-dry Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, fire burns uphill," Mahler said. Turning to the Hollywoodland Homeowners' 
Assn., Mahler lit a fire of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Rallying around Mahler's spark, the group began to demand answers about what 
had become of a strict development control plan it had drafted and submitted to 
the city last year. Spending $10,000 from its own treasury, the group drafted 
the Hollywoodland Specific Plan aimed at preventing careless development and 
maintaining the architectural integrity of the European-style architecture of 
the neighborhood just below the Hollywood sign. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of promises to approve the plan, city planning officials shocked 
the association in November when they admitted that the plan had not begun to 
move through the approval process. 
</P>
<P>
"We were convent girls running through the brothel of the bureaucracy," said 
Bob Crane, a member of the group's board of directors. "I was devasted in 
November when I found out nothing had been done." 
</P>
<P>
But with Mahler leading the charge, the group held several meetings recently 
with City Councilman Mike Woo and Planning Director Kenneth Topping. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of those meetings, Woo said Monday that the group can expect action 
on the plan by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywoodland homeowners' group, one of many wrangling with the city over 
development, has long felt it has a unique situation, demanding extraordinary 
action. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, where high land values have led to a rash of construction in 
recent years, neighborhood groups have increasingly turned to the city's 
planning process to protect themselves from the development rush. To protect 
those areas, the city has enacted dozens of interim control ordinances designed 
to restrict building for up to a year, or until a permanent specific plan can 
be put in place. 
</P>
<P>
Interim control ordinances commonly specify such things as building height, 
setback and roof pitch. In general, specific plans are more stringent than 
interim-control ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
Many Hollywoodlanders cheered in June, 1988, when the City Council's Planning 
and Environment Committee approved an association-backed interim-control 
ordinance that imposed restrictions on such things as height, setback and roof 
configuration in the area. But homeowners' association members, concerned that 
the ordinance did not protect the architectural aesthetics of the neighborhood 
or provide adequate controls on such things as fire equipment access, quickly 
set their sights on a permanent specific plan. 
</P>
<P>
While most neighborhood groups leave drafting of specific plans to the city 
Planning Department, the Hollywoodlanders paid consultants to draw up their 
plan. Under their specific plan, presented to city planners last year, all new 
construction would have to be "compatible in scale and character" with the 
neighborhood. In addition, the proposal called for builders to widen streets to 
assure firefighting access and to keep traffic lanes clear of construction 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said the group's dismay over the plan's slow movement is understandable, 
but he said, "even if a community group pays for its own plan, the city 
Planning Department still has the responsibility of reviewing it." 
</P>
<P>
The group had hoped a quickly approved permanent plan would prevent 
construction of contemporary-style homes and many members were unprepared for 
the rush of construction by builders who were hoping to get in before the 
strict specific plan was enacted. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been running in here from all over, grabbing up lots and throwing 
up shoe box-type houses," Mahler said. 
</P>
<P>
As months passed with excuses from city planners, the situation reached a flash 
point this fall as Mahler and other association members began complaining about 
abuses of the interim ordinance by builders and the city's lack of enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Many houses in Hollywoodland are perched on stilts overhanging steep ravines, 
and much of the new construction has been attempted on seemingly unbuildable 
lots. Skyrocketing property values in recent years have tempted developers to 
build on such lots. But many have given up, leaving unsightly scars in the 
Hollywoodland hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
The roads winding between Moorish mansions and Spanish haciendas are narrow and 
full of blind corners, and homeowners complain that construction under the 
interim ordinance has made that situation worse. Roads in the area are often 
obstructed by lumber, equipment and dirt piles, and have caused nearly 
impassable single lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Many association members blame their inexperience with the system for the 
delays, but some have criticized Councilmen Woo and John Ferraro, in whose 
districts Hollywoodland is located, for not following up on the specific plan. 
</P>
<P>
"When we present them with the issues, put together a careful plan, we really 
do expect some results," said Christine O'Brien, president of the association. 
"In reality, we did most of the work. But then there was no follow-through from 
the council members." 
</P>
<P>
Woo said Monday that the plan bogged down because the "Planning Department 
misled the community. The department should have been more clear that they 
would not get to (the Hollywoodland plan) right away." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywoodlanders angered by the inattention say there is some good to be found 
in their most recent battles. They say they have learned methods of attack and 
have called on other successful neighborhood groups for advice. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Nelson, president of the Laurel Canyon Area Assn., a similar hillside 
owners' group, helped the Hollywoodland group this fall in negotiations with 
Woo and city planners. Nelson, whose group has been successful in enforcing 
building restrictions, said the Hollywoodland group is learning to fight city 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the homeowners over there are learning that they have to be lobbyists, 
in effect. We realized with our plan that we could not just sit back and assume 
it would happen. We have learned that just paying our property taxes does not 
mean somebody else will take care of the problems," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson advised the group to focus its efforts on such areas as fire control. In 
fact, testimony from Los Angeles Fire Department officials that the narrow 
roadways in hillside areas severely hamper fire trucks appeared to have 
motivated Woo to action in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who regularly drives his Jeep around the Laurel Canyon area surveying 
abuses and checking into new construction permits, is a key figure behind that 
neighborhood's battles with development. He acknowledges that all available 
lots are likely to be built out, but he says his group's goal is "get it done 
in the best possible way for the community." 
</P>
<P>
In the intensely active Bruce Mahler, a star of the "Police Academy" movies, 
the Hollywoodland group thinks it may have found a similar leader who will push 
city officials to act on the belated specific plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Until Bruce took the bull by the horns, frankly, we didn't get much attention. 
Bruce made this happen," Crane said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Crane who had seen the specific plan through the past year, turned 
over the reins to Mahler, who has since spent long hours in reviewing city 
records as he takes up the fight to protect 175 unbuilt lots remaining in 
Hollywoodland. 
</P>

Though members worry those lots will be quickly developed in the coming year 
without the specific plan, they vow that they will be watching closely to make 
sure the city enforces provisions of the interim control ordinance.

BEVERLY HILLS' STARS AND IMAGE SHIELDED BY EX-POLICE CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As Clinton H. Anderson was buried this week, friends and acquaintances of the 
no-nonsense former Beverly Hills police chief paused to remember him and the 
bygone era in which he served. 
</P>
<P>
From 1942 until he resigned in 1969, Anderson protected the city's image as a 
sleepy little town for big screen stars. Back then, protecting the privacy of 
celebrities was an important part of the police force's mission. 
</P>
<P>
Arresting the rich and famous for, say, drunk driving would have been 
unthinkable; the cops would simply give them a ride home. 
</P>
<P>
"A case like Zsa Zsa Gabor's would have never made its way to some prosecutor's 
desk," observed former mayor Leonard Horwin, who served on the City Council 
from 1962 to 1966. "He was well aware of the city's image and how to protect 
it. He would preserve a certain bit of immunity for prominent people." 
</P>
<P>
"We have more celebrities in Beverly Hills than you can shake a night stick 
at," said Anderson in his 1960 book, "Beverly Hills Is My Beat," a chronicle of 
notable events in his 39 years on the force. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, of course, Beverly Hills has been home to some of the biggest 
names in show business, including the likes of Mary Pickford, Gloria Swanson, 
Will Rogers, Charlie Chaplin, Jack Benny, James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Lucille 
Ball and Harold Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's death from natural causes last week at the age of 86 led many 
longtime residents to reminisce about how life in their city has changed. 
</P>
<P>
Under Anderson's leadership, the Beverly Hills police gained a reputation as a 
highly professional force, rising in numbers from 57 to 97 officers. It has 
since grown to 128 officers. 
</P>
<P>
"He set a standard of integrity that has withstood the test of time," said 
Beverly Hills Police Chief Marvin Iannone, one of about 100 mourners who 
attended Anderson's funeral Tuesday at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale. "He 
set an example that our officers still follow today." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Fred Koch, who worked under Anderson, described the former chief as "a 
disciplinarian who saw the police force as an extension of the military, but 
instead of fighting an external enemy, we were fighting an internal one. . . . 
He gave 100% and expected 100% from his men." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was born in Providence, R.I., in 1902, the son of a police officer. In 
1929, after a brief stint in the Coast Guard, he moved to California and joined 
the Beverly Hills Police Department, where he started out as a bicycle 
patrolman and rose through the ranks to become chief in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
When he began as a patrolman, he wrote in his book, the vacant lots along 
Wilshire Boulevard outnumbered the buildings. But even then, the community was 
set apart from the rest of Los Angeles by an "invisible economic wall" because 
of the enormous wealth of many of its residents. 
</P>
<P>
He was involved in some sensational cases. Mobster Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel was 
reading a newspaper in his rented house in Beverly Hills in 1947 when he was 
shot by a gunman who had been hiding outside. The assassin was never found. 
</P>
<P>
In 1958, actress Lana Turner's boyfriend, organized crime figure Johnny 
Stompanato, was stabbed to death in Turner's home by her 14-year-old daughter, 
Cheryl Crane. Anderson had to defend his department from accusations of a 
cover-up when the killing was ruled a justifiable homicide and no charges were 
brought against Crane. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city's inhabitants included some shady characters, their crimes 
tended to be the sort accomplished with fountain pens, rather than guns or 
knives. So in most years, about 98% of the reported crime in Beverly Hills was 
committed by people who lived outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, much of Anderson's attention focused on keeping "undesirables" out -- a 
practice that often led to accusations of police harassment -- particularly of 
blacks and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not as concerned about civil liberties," said former mayor Horwin. "He 
believed in a strong 24-hour patrol of the streets, a constant movement of 
cruising police cars." 
</P>
<P>
In his book, Anderson recalled having once stationed patrol cars at the both 
ends of the street where a noted gambler lived. No one could visit the house 
without being questioned by police. 
</P>
<P>
"His socially minded wife found this terribly embarrassing, and eventually the 
gambler moved," the chief wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson defended his policy of constant surveillance as an effective deterrent 
to crime. "Citizens of Beverly Hills pay their Police Department to keep crime 
away from the city," he wrote. "Our purpose is the prevention and detection of 
crime, rather than boasting of the number of catches we make." 
</P>
<P>
On the constant lookout for prowlers, Anderson once stopped a 
suspicious-looking man who, it turned out, had just burglarized a mansion. "We 
caught him walking down a Beverly Hills street discarding stolen jewelry, piece 
by piece, which he had decided was worthless," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime resident Ellen Stern Harris said she remembers the evening when three 
judges who had dinner at her house decided to go out for a stroll afterward. 
"They were stopped by the police and asked to identify themselves -- that was 
the kind of place it was," she said. "You couldn't just go walking the street 
without having to somehow account for yourself. And, if someone had been 
drinking too much, they would have been given an escort home." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Dickson, who 20 years ago became the city's first black officer, said 
Anderson gave him an intensive interview before hiring him for the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember my friends telling me at the time, 'You must be out of your mind to 
apply for a job in Beverly Hills,' because of the reputation the city has of 
treating blacks," said Dickson, who attended Anderson's funeral. "He had 
mellowed a bit by the time I got there, but he was quite a man. Things (the 
department) have changed a lot over the years, but it could still change some 
more." 
</P>
<P>
City spokesman Fred Cunningham, who was city administrator in the 1950s, said 
the police were basically doing what the public wanted them to do. Anderson 
"was a very popular police chief," he said. "The community didn't want just 
anyone walking the streets. Things have changed now, but back then the police 
were expected to stop and ask people to identify themselves." 
</P>
<P>
March Schwartz, publisher of the weekly Beverly Hills Courier, agreed. "He was 
very protective of the stars and everyone else who lived here. It was nothing 
for him to take someone to the city limits and tell them not to come back. 
</P>
<P>
"And you know, they didn't come back." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is survived by his daughter, Glee Gerde, of Huntington Beach, three 
grandchildren and one great-grandchild. A son, Clinton Jr., was killed in 
action in Vietnam in 1968.

ALLEN EXPECTED TO ATTRACT BIG FINANCIAL HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD and DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Allen, the new football coach at Cal State Long Beach, stood at the dais 
in a conference room of the Long Beach Airport Marriott Hotel, a brown school 
cap covering shocks of black hair, a 49er jersey in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
He grinned at the media and waved to friends and former players who had come 
Tuesday to wish him well in a job that he called "the toughest in America" -- 
rebuilding a university football program that was on the verge of extinction 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But University President Curtis McCray and Athletic Director Corey Johnson made 
it clear that they were hiring the highly successful former National Football 
League coach to do more than win games. They also expect the 71-year-old 
physical fitness fanatic to give the university a significant financial boost. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't purely a football hire," McCray said later during an interview. 
"Football is the focus, but I expect (Allen) to do more." 
</P>
<P>
As part of his three-year, $100,000-a-year deal, Allen has pledged help in 
raising funds for the school's athletic foundation, which will pay $34,000 of 
his salary. 
</P>
<P>
"He has close contacts," McCray said. "We think he can draw the attention and 
resources we need." 
</P>
<P>
By using his prestige and personal charisma to encourage major donors to 
contribute "private endowments" to the university, McCray said, Allen should be 
able to raise at least $1 million by the end of his second football season. "I 
expect that he and I will be on the road together," McCray said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's hiring seemed to be in line with McCray's goal -- announced when he 
took office two years ago -- of making non-academic campus programs financially 
self-sustaining. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Allen's reputation as a winner also was a factor in the decision. 
The 49ers were 11-24 in the past three years, which prompted the resignation of 
Coach Larry Reisbig in November. The team was beaten 52-0 by Big West 
Conference champion Fresno State, 63-10 by Hawaii and 52-10 by Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
In 12 seasons in the NFL as coach of the Los Angeles Rams and the Washington 
Redskins, Allen had a record of 120-47-5, the third best winning percentage in 
league history. He rebuilt both teams quickly. The Ram franchise was 51-87-5 
before him, 49-17-4 in five seasons with him. He was voted NFL Coach of the 
Year four times. He led the 1972 Redskins to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, wearing his NFC championship ring from that Super Bowl team, admitted 
Tuesday that he will need all of those skills to help the 49ers. He said he 
took the job because it was a challenge and because it was close to his Palos 
Verdes Estates home. He said he would help raise money to build an on-campus 
football stadium, solicit more support from alumni and get students on campus 
more enthused about football. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach shares antiquated Veterans Stadium in northeast Long Beach with Long 
Beach City College and local high schools, which have preference on dates and 
times for its use. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he intends to raise the budget of the campus sports information 
director to handle the increased media attention the school expects to receive 
with Allen as its coach. 
</P>
<P>
The university's football program has held a tenuous spot in the community 
since 1986 when former University President Stephen Horn incurred the wrath of 
boosters by attempting to dismantle it. After drawing severe criticism, Horn 
changed his mind and challenged the residents of Long Beach to raise $300,000 
or lose a football team. A fund-raising drive was successful. The money was 
raised. Since then, Horn has consistently described himself as a strong 
supporter of athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
The money was raised, but the program's morale sank. Game attendance dwindled 
to an average of 2,650 fans for four home games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Horn, who is now a member of the faculty, praised Allen's selection. "I'm 
simply delighted," he said. "Anyone with (Allen's) background and personality 
will have a good leg up on funding. A vibrant athletic program obviously helps 
the university and the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an excellent move. (Allen's) reputation and credibility will 
provide the excitement that people want to see." 
</P>
<P>
Allen's hiring comes at a time when McCray has made cuts elsewhere on campus, 
particularly at campus radio station KLON and in the arts. That didn't, 
however, seem to rankle Rick Lewis, KLON's general manager, who expressed 
support for Allen's hiring on the grounds that it will help make football 
self-sustaining and thus help everyone on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect it will make more people attend," said Lewis, whose radio station 
suffered a 9% cut in its budget last year. "There's no jealousy. In general I 
think it's good to make a program as good as you can make it." 
</P>
<P>
Allen left many of the details of his contract to others and, by his own 
admission, did not research the position as thoroughly as he would have liked 
to. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not remember the length of his contract, although he said he 
thought it was for three years. He also said he couldn't remember his salary 
with the 49ers, but added, "I'd make more money in two weeks (speaking 
somewhere)." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said he had not met with the seven assistant coaches being retained by 
the school. He says he has two men, "one in the NFL right now" that he wants to 
add to the group of assistants. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he had not visited the school's playing field. "The last time I 
was at Veterans Stadium was in 1966," he said. "Has it changed much?" 
</P>
<P>
As for building a winner, Allen said: "You say 'what is realistic' to me and 
you mention 5-5. That doesn't sound good to me. . . . Here it might be a heck 
of a season." 
</P>
<P>
On the football field there are few details that slip by Allen, but off it he 
has a reputation as a spendthrift. His NFL coaching career ended when he was 
fired from the Redskins job by then-owner Edward Bennett Williams in 1977. "He 
was given an unlimited budget and he exceeded it," Williams said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a possibility Allen will make the same mistake at Long Beach? 
</P>
<P>
"You can't spend what you don't have," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Jones, president of the 49er Athletic Foundation, said he was delighted 
to have Allen in town. He said he expects the Foundation to move on one of 
Allen's few priorities, upgrading the campus weight room. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Visser, assistant coach with the 49ers for 11 years, still had not been 
introduced to Allen as he waited for his new boss to exit a TV interview in an 
adjoining room following Tuesday's press conference. He had come as "a 
liaison," for himself and the six remaining full-time coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I think George understands the (financial) limitations that Long Beach has and 
he has taken on the challenge the way it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach has a student population of more than 35,000, but support 
for its football team is minimal. Three years ago the program was almost 
canceled, but a successful fund-raising effort saved it. Since then, the 
football team has compiled an 11-24 record. Larry Reisbig, who coached the 
49ers the last three years, resigned last month.

<P>
Two veteran City Council members, responding to a key court decision upholding 
a limit on council terms, said they will not seek reelection next year. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Diana Needham and Councilman Barry Rabbitt said they will honor a ruling 
last Friday by Judge Jerold A. Krieger in Norwalk Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The judge rejected arguments that the city did not have the power to enforce 
Proposition H, a City Charter amendment that limits council members to two 
consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a decision and we should abide by it," said Needham, who has served 
three terms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's over," said Rabbitt, a 20-year council veteran. "The decision is there. I 
accept that and will continue to serve the city in some other capacity," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Kenneth Brown had argued that the measure, passed by voters in 1986, 
could not be enforced because it contained ambiguous language and because 
charter cities were preempted by state law from imposing such limits on elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
But Krieger declared from the bench that those who drafted the measure and 
voted for it clearly intended to limit council members to two consecutive 
terms. His single-page opinion said there was no preemption. 
</P>
<P>
Needham and Rabbitt said they will not ask the city to pursue the court effort, 
leaving the five-member council without three votes to appeal the case. 
Councilwoman Ann Joynt supports Proposition H. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal opinion is that this should be the final decision and there should 
not be any appeal," Needham said. Rabbitt agreed, saying, "We fought it to the 
hilt." 
</P>
<P>
Their decision, in addition to ending a two-year legal battle, opens a new era 
in Cerritos politics, according to proponents of the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and Proposition H supporters alike predict there will be a flood 
of candidates for three seats in the April 10 election. The filing period opens 
Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
With Needham and Rabbitt out, Joynt, who is serving her first term, will be the 
only incumbent competing. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll probably be about 20 people running for office," said Hydelita 
Madula-Soto, who helped draft the amendment and twice went to court to get it 
enforced. "That is what we want, a marketplace of ideas," she said. "Now you'll 
get more people interested in the elections. You'll probably increase the 
turnout." 
</P>
<P>
The amendment's backers have always argued that they were seeking to limit the 
advantages of incumbency, including name recognition and access to campaign 
money. More people would run for office if incumbents were not always running 
for reelection, proponents said. 
</P>
<P>
Madula-Soto predicted that all five city planning commissioners will probably 
enter the council contest. Commission Vice Chairman Sherman Kappe, who placed 
third in the 1988 council race, already has announced his intention to run. 
</P>
<P>
The issue first went to court during the 1988 council election. Madula-Soto and 
other Proposition H backers filed suit after incumbent Daniel Wong filed to run 
for a third term. City Clerk Caroline de Llamas, referring to an opinion by 
City Atty. Brown that the proposition was invalid, said she would allow Wong's 
name on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge ruled that Wong could run because it was not clear when 
the amendment was to have taken effect, but the decision did not address the 
city attorney's argument that the measure was unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the legal maneuvering, the council considered giving 
Proposition H proponents $10,000 to go to court to clarify the legal questions. 
City Atty. Brown contended that only backers of the measure could initiate 
legal action. 
</P>
<P>
Madula-Soto said this week that attorney's fees would have been double the 
amount that the council was considering. 
</P>
<P>
But Madula-Soto and another proposition supporter, Leora Einson, eventually 
returned to court after Rabbitt insisted that he would run for a fifth term and 
Needham said she might seek reelection if a court decision allowed it. 
Madula-Soto sought an injunction against the two incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
The city then filed a motion to block Madula-Soto's suit from being heard, 
arguing that the charter amendment was not enforceable. Judge Krieger 
disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
Madula-Soto said this week that she respects Needham and Rabbitt for accepting 
the court's decision. The two officials, who could possibly return to the 
council after sitting out a term, were gracious about the court decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate the confidence that the people have had in me," said Rabbitt, 
whose career on the council began when the city was still largely dairy fields. 
"I think the people have been great . . . Over the years I've probably knocked 
on every door in the city and I've never ceased to be amazed at the people's 
interest and pride in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Needham said that she, too, was grateful to the voters for giving her the 
opportunity to hold a post for so long. "Sometimes good things come to an end 
and this is one of them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos residents in 1986 approved Proposition H, a charter amendment that 
limits council members to two consecutive terms, but the city attorney said the 
measure was invalid because its language was murky and charter cities could not 
place such limits on council terms. Backers of the proposition first went to 
court after Councilman Daniel Wong filed to run for a third term in 1988 and 
city officials allowed his name to be placed on the ballot. A judge ruled that 
Wong could run because the effective date of the amendment was vague.

RESCUE MISSION SHOULD BE MOVED, BLIGHT STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In order to upgrade a blighted section of downtown Oxnard, a city consultant 
this week pushed for the relocation of the Ventura County Rescue Mission, one 
of the county's key facilities for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace Roberts &amp; Todd of San Francisco recommended Tuesday that the city's 
redevelopment agency remove the mission from its 18-year location at East 6th 
Street, near Meta Street, as part of its plan for revamping the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
"If the rescue mission is retained, it's basically incompatible with the land 
uses and an impediment to change," said consultant Robert Bruce Anderson. 
"We've simply heard from too many people that they wouldn't make investments if 
the mission was there." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said the recommendation to transfer the mission was "one of the most 
difficult decisions we had to make." 
</P>
<P>
Consultants began in July to study ways to update a 1985 plan for Oxnard's 
30-block downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
They also created a detailed master development plan for Meta Street, a 
four-block area in the central business district, which a staff report said 
"currently displays the most seriously blighted physical conditions that remain 
in the downtown area." 
</P>
<P>
The final downtown study will be presented to the City Council, which functions 
as the city's redevelopment agency, in one to two months for formal acceptance. 
For now, Anderson suggested that the agency begin investigating potential sites 
for the move. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue Mission Director Jerry Roberg said he would keep an open mind and 
negotiate with the city. But he said he is wary that paying for a new location 
might jeopardize the mission's financial security. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not into building properties," he said. "We're into building people." 
</P>
<P>
The mission is open 24 hours a day, providing the homeless with 73 beds, 
showering facilities and a mailing address. 
</P>
<P>
It also gives away clothing for women and children, runs a drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation program and serves 300 meals a day. 
</P>
<P>
Roberg plans to expand the rehabilitation program, which currently helps 23 
men. He said he also wants to expand the facilities and start a family shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The mission has completely paid for its property and is able to put all its 
money into services for the poor, Roberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"We like it where we're at and we'd like to stay there," Roberg told the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Dorothy Maron said the mission could not be moved until another 
facility was up and running. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Nao Takasugi and Manuel Lopez disqualified themselves from the 
discussion because they own properties in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Kinney, director of Oxnard's Redevelopment and Economic Development 
departments, said the city would not back a move unless a mutually agreeable 
site is found for the mission. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, moving the mission was at the hub of the plan for Meta 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Revamping Meta Street began earlier this year with the city's acquisition of 
more land, condemnation of the crime-ridden Lemon Tree Hotel and plans for a 
new community health clinic, Kinney said. 
</P>
<P>
Further improvements could be made, the consultants said, by building 
attractive low- and moderate-income housing rather than sticking to earlier 
recommendations that the area be developed for commercial and light industrial 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
Family-support organizations such as child-care facilities and legal services 
should then be drawn to the area, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Meta Street could become a focal point for the Latino community if 
it is promoted as a meeting place for Latino organizations and a location for 
Latino-owned and oriented businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the goals for the downtown area are the upgrading of building 
facades, eliminating safety hazards and formally recognizing cultural 
landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
To implement the suggestions, the study recommended a downtown assessment 
district be formed. 
</P>
<P>
"Downtown has to have a manager," Anderson said. "And the only way to pay for 
one is through an assessment district." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some of the changes in setbacks and zoning -- proposed to make 
downtown's "visual character interesting and inviting" -- would require 
altering the general plan.

CHRISTMAS TREE RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city will operate Christmas tree collection facilities at four locations on 
Dec. 30 and Jan. 6. Residents are encouraged to bring their trees in for 
recycling into compost and boiler fuel. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for their trees, residents will receive a free pine tree seedling. 
Last year, more than 2,000 trees were collected for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
The collection points will be at four city parks: Clover Park at Ocean Park 
Boulevard and 25th Street, Douglas Park at Wilshire Boulevard and 25th Street, 
Lincoln Park at Lincoln and Wilshire boulevards and Los Amigos Park at 5th 
Street and Hollister Avenue. They will operate from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Dec. 30 
and Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal of this project is not only to help reduce the amount of waste being 
disposed of in landfills, but also to educate the public that most trees and 
nearly all organic yard and kitchen waste have a great value when recycled into 
compost," said Deborah Baine, the city's recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The city has set a goal of reducing the amount of waste dumped in landfills by 
25%, and is conducting a study to determine the feasibility of separately 
collecting residential yard waste for compost. The study is expected to be 
completed in March.

VOTING DAY CHANGE SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acting under rules laid down in state law, the Beverly Hills City Council set 
April 10, the first day of the Jewish Passover holiday, as Election Day to fill 
two City Council seats. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to concerns expressed by some residents, City Clerk Jean Ushijima 
said the date could be changed if state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) 
persuades the state Legislature to waive the requirement to hold the election 
on the second Tuesday in April. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Max Salter and City Councilman Robert K. Tanenbaum, who was mayor in 
1988-89, said they would run for reelection. Both were elected for the first 
time in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
It will cost $30,000 to $35,000 to hold the election, said Fred Cunningham, a 
city spokesman. Voter turnout in recent elections has ranged from 26.4% in 1978 
to 46.9% in 1982, when a rent control initiative was on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest election, held in 1988, 36.5% of the electorate of about 20,000 
voted, at a cost of about $4 each. A smaller turnout is expected this year.

INCREASE IN CRIME REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Baldwin Hills-Ladera Heights area experienced a 11.7% increase in crime 
during the first 11 months of this year, with a sharp jump in armed robberies 
and vehicle burglaries in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which patrols the unincorporated 
area, said 840 serious crimes were reported through November, up from 752 in 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
The largest increases occurred in cases of rape, up 66.6%; robbery, up 44.7%; 
larceny and theft, up 32.4%, and vehicle theft, up 17.5%. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the area, which also includes Windsor Hills and View Park, had a 
40.8% increase in crime over October levels. The number of armed robberies 
jumped from four in October to 13 in November, while vehicle burglaries nearly 
quadrupled, from seven to 27. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Ray Sanchez, head of the marina sheriff's station, said there was "no 
rhyme or reason" for the surge of crime in November, although he speculated 
that a former prisoner may have been released and was hitting that particular 
area. Most of the robberies occurred in Ladera Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said the person or people involved in the November incidents had either 
been arrested or had moved on to other areas because "whatever happened in 
November is not occurring in December." 
</P>
<P>
The number of arrests in the area increased nearly 17% in the first 11 months 
of this year.

SCHOOL DISTRICT AWARDS PACT FOR 3-STORY HEADQUARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A contract has been awarded to the Moran Construction Co. of Alhambra to build 
a $6-million administration building for the Lynwood Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the three-story building is scheduled to start early next year 
and be completed in 16 months. It will be at 11321 Bullis Road, directly across 
the street from Lynwood City Hall on a portion of Hosler Junior High School 
land. 
</P>
<P>
The new building will replace the overcrowded administration facility, which is 
in a shopping center in the city's redevelopment area and is expected to be 
sold to the Lynwood Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The new building is being paid for with money raised by the sale of 
certificates of participation, a financing tool similar to bonds. The building 
will be large enough to accommodate 120 district employees.

CITY LOOSENS RULES FOR TENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homeowners who want to put up a tent in their back yard for entertaining or 
fund raising will be able to do so legally without obtaining a city permit, 
under a Zoning Code amendment approved Tuesday by the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The tent amendment allows people to erect tents smaller than 800 square feet 
twice a year for no longer than 36 hours each time. The amendment also allows 
people without a permit to put up tents for fewer than three days in the Rose 
Bowl area of the Arroyo Seco. 
</P>
<P>
Permits will be required for tents in other open space areas and for larger 
tents or those left standing for longer periods of time. The fee is $404.

ARMENIA SISTER CITY STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city formerly closed to foreigners in Soviet Armenia could become the city's 
fourth Sister City under a recommendation from the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
Byurakan, Armenia, a town of 25,000 people that was previously not even listed 
on maps, was proposed Tuesday by the board. The town is in the Caucasus 
Mountains and is well known as a scientific center and for its observatory, 
said Charles Papas, a professor of electrical engineering at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian city would join the ranks of Ludwigshafen in West Germany, Mishima 
in Japan and Jarvenpaa in Finland, if the city's Sister City Committee approves 
the choice. Director Bill Paparian suggested that the decision be made by May. 
</P>
<P>
But Anthony Anderson, head of the city's Sister City Committee, said approval 
must also be received from Soviet officials in Moscow, who have approved 36 
Soviet cities previously. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members also said that the Armenian city may not be an appropriate 
choice for the program, because of the possible lack of cultural and 
educational institutions through which visitors are exchanged. But Mayor 
William Thomson suggested that the relationship with Byurakan might be 
different -- more technical and practical -- than previous Sister City 
exchanges.

RECYCLING PROGRAM BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West Hollywood has begun the first part of a long-awaited recycling program, 
with the second phase scheduled to begin shortly after New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
The city has placed six large bins in central areas where residents can drop 
off aluminum, glass, paper and soft plastic containers for recycling. In 
addition, single-family homes will be able to set out recyclable material for 
curbside pickup after the new year. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council worked for years on the issue, and some members hope a 
successful program will pave the way for an even more comprehensive approach. 
</P>
<P>
"The step I am anxious to take is a little more difficult. I hope the next 
stage will include on-site pickup at apartments and condominiums as well," said 
Councilman Paul Koretz. 
</P>
<P>
Koretz said the council will wait to see how the new program works before 
expanding it. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, only single-family homes are included in curbside pickup on 
garbage collection days. The majority of West Hollywood residents live in 
multiple-unit buildings and will be able to use the centrally located 
collection bins. 
</P>
<P>
The bins are located in the parking lot at 8878 Sunset Blvd.; West Hollywood 
Park; the Center for Early Education at 563 N. Alfred St.; Plummer Park; City 
Hall, 8611 Santa Monica Blvd., and at the ARCO gasoline station, 8020 Santa 
Monica Blvd.

BADER JOINS RECALL DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona) has joined the campaign to recall 
Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, accusing him of "abuse of the public trust" 
through intimidation of employees and of favoritism in the handling of city 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Bader, a former Pomona mayor who served with Bryant on the council in the early 
1970s, said he has never, until now, signed a recall petition. But he said 
Bryant should be removed from office for reasons that amount to "political 
corruption." 
</P>
<P>
He accused Bryant of engineering the firing of Police Chief Richard M. Tefank, 
making personal attacks on police officers, intimidating employees, attempting 
to cancel the services of the Pomona Valley Humane Society because of his 
"personal dislike" for the director and of denying payments to another city 
contractor "for political reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said he was not surprised by Bader's decision to join the recall 
campaign, saying that Bader "is one of the good old boys" who used to control 
city government, but are now out of power. Bryant said Bader's influence among 
Pomona voters "is nil. I don't worry about Bader."

COMPUTER LOAN PLAN SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to promote computer literacy and pave the way for employees to 
work at home, the City Council has approved an interest-free computer loan 
program for half- to full-time city employees. 
</P>
<P>
The city will provide loans of up to $3,000 to 43 eligible employees, including 
City Council members, for the purchase of home computers and software 
compatible with the city's system. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Don Pruyn said the program will encourage greater 
computer proficiency and will allow employees to work at home, reducing traffic 
and enabling the city to meet future South Coast Air Quality Management 
District requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The program's $50,000 budget will come from the city's Vehicle Replacement 
Fund, normally used to replace city trucks and other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Payments, made through monthly payroll deductions, will go back into the 
vehicle fund. Loans must be repaid in two years. 
</P>
<P>
The vendor, Computer Vision of San Dimas, in January will show city employees 
four computer packages available, with prices ranging from $1,425 to $3,174.

BOARD ELECTION CANCELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six seats on the Hacienda Heights Improvement Assn.'s board of directors will 
be filled without an election next year because only six candidates are 
running, Barbara Fish, association president said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Doing without a formal election will save the group hundreds of dollars, said 
Fish. The association, governed by a 12-member board, acts as liaison between 
the community and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. About 1,000 of 
Hacienda Height's 17,000 households are dues-paying members of the association. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real battle to get people to say they'll run since we're all volunteers 
and have to foot the bill for everything," Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates for the six open seats will start two-year terms Jan. 15, 1990. 
They are incumbents Sally Bianco, Bernadette King and Linda Renfroe, and 
Lillian Avery, Raul Sahagun and Robert Tsang. After they take office, the board 
will elect a new president to replace Fish, who said she will not seek 
reelection.

State election officials cleared the way Tuesday for Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach) to run for a coveted state Senate seat in a special election 
that was set for Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates for the seat vacated by the resignation of state Sen. William 
Campbell include Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whitter), whose 52nd District also 
includes the San Gabriel Valley communities of Diamond Bar, Hacienda Heights, 
La Habra Heights, Rowland Heights, Walnut and part of West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Striking a compromise between warring Republican candidates, Gov. George 
Deukmejian on Tuesday set the Feb. 6 date for the primary election and set 
April 10 for the general election to replace Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson was assured a spot in the Feb. 6 primary on Tuesday when election 
officials ruled that he had narrowly met a 30-day residency requirement when he 
moved to Laguna Beach last month to be eligible to run.

CHURCH AIDS FOOD BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Westwood Presbyterian Church has donated $8,700 to the Westside Food Bank. 
The money was raised through the church's annual musical benefit, held in July. 
</P>
<P>
"This donation translates to more than 30,000 meals," said Bruce Rankin, 
executive director of the food bank. "One benefit of this kind of support is 
that it helps to keep many financially pressed families in their housing at 
this critical time of the year." 
</P>
<P>
The food bank was founded in 1981 by the Westside Ecumenical Conference, the 
Interfaith Hunger Coalition and local social service agencies. It purchases and 
collects surplus food and distributes it free to 33 nonprofit agencies serving 
needy people in Santa Monica, Venice, Culver City, Westchester, West Los 
Angeles, Beverly Hills and Inglewood.

TRUCK FIRM GETS 2ND CHANCE TO BID ON AUTO PLAZA LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Mack Truck franchise that wants to locate in the Compton Auto Plaza will get 
a second chance to present its case before the Compton City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed this week, on a motion by Councilwoman Bernice Woods, to let 
Universal Mack Sales and Services make a new offer for the approximately 12 
acres it wants to buy in the plaza, which is located alongside the Artesia (91) 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
On a 3-2 vote last week, the council turned down a $3.7-million offer from the 
firm, which wants to consolidate its Signal Hill and Los Angeles operations in 
Compton. The council said it would not sell the land for under the appraised 
value of $4.7 million, nor was it interested, it said, in carrying a mortgage 
for Universal Mack. The firm wanted to put down $1 million and pay the balance 
over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The parcel of land in question is the same one on which a community activist 
group wants to build about 600 low-cost, owner-occupied townhouses. The South 
Central Organizing Committee offered the city $5 million for the undeveloped 24 
acres left in the auto plaza. The council, however, has said it wants 
commercial development on the land.

OFFICER PUT ON LEAVE DURING CHECK OF ASSAULT COMPLAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Compton police officer has been put on administrative leave pending an 
investigation of allegations that he assaulted a female Compton police officer 
with whom he had a personal relationship. 
</P>
<P>
The female officer, whose name is not being released by three law enforcement 
agencies involved in the case, filed an assault complaint against Officer 
Glendal Whitney on Dec. 4 with the Police Department in Santa Monica, where the 
alleged incident took place. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Detective Sgt. Timothy Bauer said his department turned the case 
over to a special unit of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
that investigates cases involving police officers. Whitney was on the Santa 
Monica force before he joined the Compton department. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Herbert R. Lapin declined to release any details about the 
case, except to say that the allegations do not involve rape and that no 
charges have been filed against Whitney. Compton Police Cmdr. Terry Ebert said 
his department is conducting an internal investigation into the allegations.

MORATORIUM PLACED ON LAST VACANT COMMERCIAL PARCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Artesia City Council has placed a one-year moratorium on the development of 
a six-acre site at South Street and Pioneer Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
It will allow the council time to come up with a development plan that will 
bring more sales taxes into the city, Mayor Dennis Fellows said. About 40% of 
the city's $3.2-million budget for 1989-90 is from sales taxes. "This is the 
last remaining single piece of property left in the city and we would like to 
see an attractive development there, perhaps a shopping center rather than some 
type of hodgepodge," Fellows said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the land, which is on the southwest corner of the intersection, is 
vacant, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fellows said the council had heard so many rumors about what was going to 
happen to the property that officials decided to take action. The moratorium 
will not prevent owners of the property from selling, and it can be lifted at 
any time, Fellows said. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are being made to get the council, city staff and property owners 
together for discussions, Fellows said.

STATE CLEARS WAY FOR FERGUSON TO RUN FOR SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State election officials have cleared the way for Assemblyman Gil Ferguson to 
run for a coveted state Senate seat in a special election that was set for Feb. 
6. 
</P>
<P>
Striking a compromise between warring Republican candidates, Gov. George 
Deukmejian on Tuesday set the Feb. 6 date for the primary election and April 10 
for the general election to replace state Sen. William Campbell, who resigned 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson was assured a spot in the Feb. 6 primary on Tuesday when election 
officials ruled that he had narrowly met a 30-day residency requirement when he 
moved to Laguna Beach last month to be eligible to run. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement sets the stage for a brief and intense seven-week Republican 
primary battle among Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), Assemblyman Frank Hill 
(R-Whittier) and Brea Councilman Ron Isles in a sprawling, strongly Republican 
district that runs from Laguna Beach north into southern Los Angeles County, 
including Whittier, La Mirada and La Habra Heights. 
</P>
<P>
The short period could favor Assembly members Hill and Ferguson because they 
are known to the greatest number of voters. But Isles said he is prepared to 
spend $500,000 of his own money on the campaign, which could give him a 
financial advantage in a short race. 
</P>
<P>
Isles launched his first attack Tuesday, charging that Hill "is moonlighting 
for special interests." He issued a statement saying Hill collected $52,412 
last year in gifts and honorariums -- more than Hill's $44,000 legislative 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
"Where I come from, it looks like Frank Hill has a second job; he is 
moonlighting for the special interests," Isles said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said Tuesday that he is happy he will be able to run for the seat, but 
he still charged that the quick election put him at a disadvantage and that it 
was evidence that Hill's Sacramento colleagues are meddling in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"This means the voters will only have about 30 days to learn about the 
candidates," Ferguson said in a statement. "I am the best qualified candidate 
and am determined to win this race. No amount of back-room maneuvering or 
setting of election dates can stop our huge volunteer army." 
</P>
<P>
Hill did not return repeated telephone calls to his office Monday or Tuesday. 
But Sal Russo, campaign manager for Hill, said his candidate's name is the most 
prominent in the field and, therefore, he should be helped. "Think of it 
practically," he said. "Would Hill have been for an early election if he didn't 
think it would help?" 
</P>
<P>
The 31st State Senate District seat officially became vacant Friday when 
Campbell, a 20-year legislative veteran, resigned to become president of the 
California Manufacturers Assn. In addition to the Republicans, at least one 
Democrat, El Toro attorney Thomas M. Whaling, has also announced his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian announced the election dates Tuesday evening after returning from 
the scene of a fatal train crash in Stockton. Tom Beerman, a spokesman for the 
governor, said Deukemejian wanted to schedule the general election on April 10 
because it coincides with several local elections in the district and would 
therefore save money for the county governments. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and state Republican leaders were also concerned about clearing up 
the questions surrounding Campbell's seat and the two Assembly seats before the 
election in June. 
</P>
<P>
If the special election were held later, it could force Ferguson and Hill to 
file for both reelection to the Assembly and election to the Senate seat. If 
that happened, Republican leaders feared that a Democrat might be elected in 
the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
The residency requirement for Ferguson came into play when he was forced to 
move into the 31st State Senate District in order to run.

MOORPARK AMENDS RENT CONTROL TO SETTLE SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: AN OUT-OF-COURT SETTLEMENT WILL ALLOW THE CITY'S ONLY MOBILE HOME PARK 
OWNER TO RAISE RENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Moorpark has agreed to amend a rent control ordinance governing its 
only mobile home park as part of an out-of-court settlement of a suit 
challenging the law, authorities said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also allows Villa del Arroyo Ltd., owner of the 240-unit park 
off Los Angeles Avenue, to impose a one-time rent increase this month averaging 
18% and to begin separate billing for water next year instead of including it 
in rents. Villa del Arroyo, which filed the $1-million lawsuit in February, had 
applied for the special increase independent of the issues raised in the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time increase will raise rents to $330 to $375 a month, up from $279 to 
$320 a month, according to a summary of the settlement released by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the proposed increases prompted about 200 park residents to 
attend a City Council meeting on Sept. 20. A spokeswoman for the park's 
homeowners association could not be reached for comment on the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Robert S. Coldren, a Santa Ana attorney representing the park's owner, said his 
client was agreeable to the settlement but was not entirely satisfied. "We 
don't like government intrusion into private property rights in any form," 
Coldren said. 
</P>
<P>
Coldren said the decision to challenge the ordinance, which the city adopted 
after its incorporation in 1983, stemmed from the success of a similar case in 
Santa Barbara. In that case, he said, the owner of a mobile home park won 
$315,000 in damages from the city of Santa Barbara after a rent control limit 
on increases after resale was declared unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the outcome of the Santa Barbara case, Moorpark City Manager 
Steve Kueny said Moorpark's settlement could only save the city money in legal 
fees and potential damages. Under terms of the settlement, the city will pay 
only $10,000 over the next three years to help low-income tenants of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Amendments to the ordinance will allow rents to be raised each time a mobile 
home space is sold.

'GO SLOW' CLUB OF RUNNERS IS FAST COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With every stride the pace seemed more dull for jogger Dan Ashimine, who likes 
his running that way. 
</P>
<P>
It was almost noon. Along with 15 members of his Gardena Valley Runners club, 
Ashimine exited Crenshaw Boulevard at El Camino College, part of a 10-mile 
circle that begins and ends at Ashimine's auto repair shop in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Founder, coach and sometimes surrogate father to about 60 members of the club, 
Ashimine insists on a slow pace for all his runners. On this run there were no 
mad dashes, no wind sprints. The joggers, some in the street, others on the 
sidewalk, even stopped at red signal lights, talking among themselves as they 
went. 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine's approach to distance running, which he calls "discipline training," 
is unorthodox. But as the Gardena Valley Runners post more victories in amateur 
street races, his ideas are drawing attention. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Ashimine has no formal training in track or road running, but most 
of his runners say his ideas have helped them post personal-best times. Said 
Deke Houlgate, a veteran distance runner who does public relations for the 
Redondo Beach Super Bowl 5-K and 10-K Run: "The club is just one man's 
personality. He took what he's learned in running and applied it to others." 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine took up distance running a decade ago as a release for the tension of 
running a small business. He has a simple philosophy: "We start off easy, and I 
peak (the runners) at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
Years of pounding the streets around the South Bay on his own convinced 
Ashimine that conventional training did not work for the average runner, so in 
1982 he founded the Gardena Valley club. Each member pays a one-time fee of 
$15. Ashimine encourages average Joes to join. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take just about anybody," he said, "but they have to be nice." 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine believes in daily street workouts of 10 to 20 miles. Each weekday at 
11 a.m., members gather at his auto shop, behind an old house on 168th Street 
near Normandie Avenue. The club headquarters is a small wooden shed paneled 
with snapshots of the runners in action. 
</P>
<P>
From here they leave on a two-hour jaunt along 190th Street to the Redondo 
Beach Pier, or through the industrial section of Gardena into Torrance and 
around El Camino College and Alondra Park. 
</P>
<P>
Each runner is thinly clad in running shorts, lightweight shoes without socks, 
and distinctive yellow T-shirts and tank tops bearing the Gardena Valley 
Runners logo. On a recent run, the yellow shirts seemed almost as brilliant as 
the plentiful December sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
Along the street-racing circuit, those yellow shirts are becoming increasingly 
familiar. The no-name Gardena Valley Runners have made a name for themselves by 
dominating local 5-K and 10-K runs and marathons in the past few years. At the 
annual Torrance Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving Day, the first six finishers wore 
yellow shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real strong club, very visible, but they have no big-name runners," 
said Don Franken, a professional track promoter who handles some of the world's 
elite runners. 
</P>
<P>
The club's successes have made Ashimine something of a track guru. 
</P>
<P>
"If he started out with a famous miler and got him a world record, than he 
would have received the recognition he deserves," said Houlgate. "But he's 
starting with guys that aren't even known." 
</P>
<P>
Yet as word of Ashimine's unusual training philosophy spreads, top-flight 
runners have begun to seek him out. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't attract those kind of guys unless you are doing something right," 
Houlgate said. 
</P>
<P>
Road-racing experts such as Houlgate and Franken see the Gardena Valley Runners 
at a crossroads. Already, Ashimine has trained distance runners from Europe, 
Africa and Mexico. Several top performers in this year's CIF Southern Section 
high school finals are members of the club. And recently Ashimine acquired two 
road racers from Kenya, Sam Obwocha and William Musyoki. Both rank among the 
world's 10 best, according to Houlgate. 
</P>
<P>
"If I keep pluggin' with this system, I think that I might be able to change a 
few things," Ashimine said. 
</P>
<P>
The auto repair shop, down a driveway under a neon sign, is hidden behind the 
old house and its chain-link fence. On a recent morning, the pungent odor of 
axle grease filled the air. Mercedes-Benzes, Mazdas and Chevrolets were lined 
up three deep waiting for service. Ashimine, clad in faded jeans, tennis shoes 
and one of those yellow T-shirts, wiped his hands clean. 
</P>
<P>
"Have trouble finding the place?" he asked. "Most people do the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Soon runners began arriving to warm up for their daily jog. 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine took a seat in the runners' office, next to the service bay. The only 
hint of the pressure he says he feels as a businessman was that telltale sign 
of the auto mechanic: black grime under his fingernails. All he wanted to talk 
about was running. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm mad," Ashimine said. "We have the best runners in the world in the United 
States, but we have no world-class results. I attribute that to our training 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"We shoot for the short-term goal. We go out to win a marathon in two years. It 
takes most guys seven or eight years. That's why in the Olympics you never see 
a young guy winning. They're all 30 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine admits that he is "just a little guy" in world running circles. But he 
said: "I expect to change the whole system. There's no money in it. I got to do 
it for the love of the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Having the two Kenyans in his camp has boosted Ashimine's stock. And five of 
his runners qualified for the U.S. Olympic marathon trials. He is now grooming 
several athletes for money races in this country and in Europe. The next major 
local event will be the Long Beach Marathon in May. 
</P>
<P>
"I will change things strictly by example," he said. "I want the results to do 
the talking." 
</P>
<P>
Others will talk about Ashimine, who prefers a low-key approach to coming off 
as cocky. Said Obwocha, who is attempting a comeback after an auto accident in 
Dallas two years ago: "Dan's not a world-class coach, but you listen to him and 
do what he says and it works." 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Sullivan, who calls herself an average runner, continues to post personal 
bests. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe you can train so slow and still get stronger and stronger," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine allows his pupils a maximum of 90 road miles a week. Each passes 
slowly, but on race day he gives each individual a goal and tells him to turn 
up the burner. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't fatigue or hurt anything, yet it makes your muscles strong and ready 
for speed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Rosas of San Pedro, who recently won the Culver City Marathon, is 
another Ashimine disciple. His performances are approaching world-class status. 
He runs an average marathon in a little over two hours and 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a little club, the only club in the United States of its kind," Rosas 
said. "There is no pressure to perform. When you are ready, you are ready. Dan 
understands that, and he's right there for you all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Rosas, who at one time was under contract to a major shoe manufacturer, said he 
became disgusted with the treatment he received. 
</P>
<P>
"You never saw or talked to anyone in the company," he said. "All you saw was 
shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Rosas and others say an important aspect of the Gardena Valley Runners is its 
family atmosphere, which Ashimine believes inspires runners to set personal 
records. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone here cares for you, and I like that," Obwocha said as he chatted with 
other club members at the auto shop. All seemed to enjoy the others' company. 
</P>
<P>
Kidded Harold Letting, 36, of Redondo Beach: "We're all really a bunch of 
snots. All of us hate to get beat by good runners, so we pull for each other. 
I'm running faster now than when I was in high school." 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine enjoys working with average runners. 
</P>
<P>
"In a club like this you have to have balance," he said. "The slow people, the 
average person, is the heart of the club. They support it; they do all the work 
for the others." 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine receives funding from private donors, whom he refused to name. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all doctors and lawyers in the community who do it just for the love 
of sport," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Franken says it is a shame that more clubs don't use the family approach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not IBM or Pepsi or a generic-name club," he said of Gardena Valley. "But 
it's an important club. Those are the things that keep track going. What 
(Ashimine) does is a real positive effort for the community." 
</P>
<P>
The runners took a water break at the baseball fields at Alondra Park, rounded 
El Camino College once more and went east on busy Manhattan Beach Boulevard to 
Crenshaw Boulevard, where they turned back toward Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Some had removed their shirts to take advantage of the warm sunshine. Ashimine, 
his yellow shirt dripping with sweat, led the group slowly south along the 
sidewalk, an hour and a half after the run began. 
</P>
<P>
At the Crenshaw Boulevard parking lot at El Camino, Ashimine stopped and let 
the others go on without him. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks for everything," he said to a reporter who was following the group in a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
A smile crossed his face. The yellow shirts were growing smaller on the horizon 
as they turned east on 168th Street. But there was no need to hurry, he 
thought. He'd catch up to them in his own time. 
</P>

EARLY SIGNS POINT TO FILLMORE AS TOP TITLE CONTENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The journey through the balanced Tri-Valley League this season could be as 
entertaining as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Diego is the early favorite to win its second consecutive league title, 
but the league's six teams are expected to have their say before the final jump 
shot is airborne. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore, especially, has looked strong in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
"Bishop Diego is a little better than the rest of us, but several teams are 
right on their heels," Fillmore Coach Jim Fauver said. "It's going to be one of 
those years where you can be 0-10, 5-5, or 10-0." 
</P>
<P>
Fauver, who came out of coaching retirement last year and gave the Flashes a 
commitment only through this season, hopes his team sports the latter record. 
Thus far, Fillmore is a surprising 6-1, losing only in the final of its own 
tournament to Nordhoff. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been playing pretty well, and I think it's a little surprising," Fauver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Flashes, who have only three players taller than 6-foot, were supposed to 
be too small to be a factor in the league race. Fauver isn't comfortable with 
5-10 players starting at the forward positions, but the Flashes have responded. 
</P>
<P>
"Fillmore has become a contender," St. Bonaventure Coach Marc Groff said. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Aguilar, a 5-10 senior forward, has scored 30 or more points twice and 
Pokey Sanchez is contributing double-figure scoring. Mike Richardson, 
Fillmore's only big man at 6-6, is handling the middle in place of injured 6-1 
senior Mike Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson is expected to return from an early-season ankle injury this week, 
which relieves some of the rebounding woes on a team that still doesn't have a 
consistent starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bonaventure has five returning letterman from a team that was 15-9 and lost 
to eventual-state champion Santa Clara in the Southern Section 2-A Division 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Groff hopes his team's traditionally strong defense carries the Seraphs into 
the playoffs for the fifth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Seraphs appear to be on their way. Their defense is holding teams 
to 45 points a game their balanced offensive attack is led by guards Kevin Zoll 
(11 points a game) and Marvin Sagles (12). Frank Huber, a 6-5 junior, has 
grabbed 10 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
Although Groff isn't pleased with his team's field-goal shooting, the 
aggressive Seraph defense and deliberate offense has led them to a 3-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real pleased with the defense," Groff said. "But we have to start shooting 
the ball better." 
</P>
<P>
Groff hopes the basketball begins to find the bottom of the net soon, or the 
Seraphs won't be able to keep up with the remaining talent in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Diego has six letterman returning from last year's 18-6 team and is led 
by Dan Wolf, a 6-3 forward who as an all-league selection as a sophomore last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, which is 18-63 the past four years, is off to a 5-5 start and is 
perhaps the most improved team in the league. Six Musketeers are averaging 10 
points or more a game. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we've already made some great strides," first-year Moorpark Coach 
Tim Bednar said. "I think we have a legitimate shot at finishing among the top 
three." 
</P>
<P>
Carpinteria lost eight players from last year's 11-14 team, including the 
league's Player of the Year in Jeff Meister, but is expected to compete for a 
playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park, which was 8-16 last year, is led by 6-6 center Ben Feick. Feick 
averaged 10 points and eight rebounds a game last year.

HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PREVIEW;

FRONTIER LEAGUE TEAMS WILL CHASE SANTA CLARA AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Frontier League followers are growing weary of Santa Clara High's dominance 
the past decade, they'll be exhausted Feb. 9 when the Saints will probably 
capture their 11th league title in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara, the defending state 2-A champion, has yet to be challenged this 
season. The top-ranked Saints (8-0) have beaten larger schools, including Simi 
Valley and Santa Barbara -- the Marmonte and Channel League preseason 
favorites. Santa Clara beat Simi Valley by 41 points and Santa Barbara by 16. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Cvijanovich was somewhat apprehensive because of his team's inexperience at 
the start of the season, but the Saints' prayers are still being answered after 
a 27-3 year that included a 78-54 win over Orange Lutheran for the state title. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel real good about the potential of this team," said Cvijanovich, who 
earned his 600th coaching win Dec. 11 with its 72-56 win over Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are busting their butts and, even though they're young, they have 
good ability." 
</P>
<P>
Few people have ever questioned the ability of Santa Clara's players, 
especially the skills of players such as Shon Tarver. Tarver, a 6-foot-5 senior 
who is only 16 years old and is among the more-recruited players in the nation, 
was the Division IV Player of the Year and a first-team all-state selection. 
Tarver is averaging 29.5 points a game, and scored a school-record 44 against 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"The big advantage they have over us is Tarver," said Nordhoff Coach Dick 
Sebek, whose team is among the league's elite. "Not many players in the state 
are as good as he is. You have to give credit to their other players, but he 
can dominate." 
</P>
<P>
Those other players are returning lettermen Bruce Howarth, a 5-9 senior point 
guard who is a captain along with Tarver, Anthony Maestas (6-2 junior forward) 
and Evan Swanger (6-2 junior forward). Add four talented sophomores in Art 
Barron (5-9), Chris Cole (6-4), Isiah Mustafa (6-2) and Stevie Amar (6-4), and 
the remaining coaches are left to devise plans to win the battle for second 
place. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good size, excellent speed, and a superstar," Cvijanovich said. "So 
it's no wonder they are picking us to win it. They're trying to put the 
pressure on us, and it's stupid. It just helps us." 
</P>
<P>
The only bad news floating around Friedrich Pavilion this season -- and it's 
relegated to whispers when discussed at all -- are the sanctions handed down by 
the CIF Southern Section after Santa Clara refused to return to the South Coast 
Christmas tournament at Estancia High in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich, upset with the officiating in a 39-38 loss to Edison, refused to 
return to the tournament for two consolation games that Santa Clara eventually 
forfeited. In March the CIF ruled Santa Clara broke its tournament contract and 
barred the Saints' varsity, sophomore and freshman teams from competing in any 
tournaments this season. Santa Clara also had to pay restitution of about $900 
for officials, loss of gate receipts and loss of snack-bar revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich said the $900 was an exaggerated estimate, and said tournament 
officials broke the contract by using local referees. Santa Clara, barred from 
tournaments, has been forced to schedule nonleague games as far away as San 
Diego and Antelope Valley. On their way back from San Diego, the Saints stopped 
by Quartz Hill on Tuesday for a 57-51 win, concluding a four-day, 500-mile 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rough on the kids, but we'll survive," Cvijanovich said. "It was just a 
bad experience." 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich, who is 604-202 during 37 years of coaching, doesn't dwell on the 
subject. He is more concerned with developing a young squad and fighting 
potential challenges from Agoura and Nordhoff, which tied for second place last 
year at 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura is led by junior point guard Sean Martin, a first-team all-league choice 
who averaged 16.2 points. The Chargers are quick, and hope to run and press 
their way to another 4-AA playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
But Agoura will find a challenge in Nordhoff, which returns three all-league 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Fournier (5-10 senior guard) averaged 10.3 points and Trevor Taylor (6-2 
senior forward) averaged 17 points and were first-team selections. Junior Tim 
Sebek, Coach Dick Sebek's son, averaged 12.6 points and was named to the second 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"They are the mainstays of our squad," Dick Sebek said. 
</P>
<P>
Nordhoff's tallest player is 6-3, so the Rangers will rely on a fast-paced 
offense and aggressive defense in their bid for a fifth playoff berth in six 
seasons. Sebek compares this year's team with the 1985 squad that lost in the 
Southern Section semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always felt that this was the group to come along," he said. "It's a good 
situation for us." 
</P>
<P>
Nordhoff will discover just how good almost immediately; The Rangers open 
league play Jan. 5 at Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to be ready to go right away," Sebek said. "We'll know right away 
if we can compete." 
</P>
<P>
Eight players return from a Calabasas team that finished fourth at 4-6. The 
Coyotes are led by Jim Friedlander, a first-team all-league selection who 
averaged 12.5 points as a forward last year but has moved to point guard. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula and Santa Ynez will attempt to avoid the cellar. Santa Paula, which 
was 0-10 in league play and 1-19 overall, is led by Danny Lona (5-8 senior), 
Everett Corona (6-0 senior), Jaime Medrano (6-0 senior) and Jason Acosta (5-11 
junior). 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ynez, 2-8 in league play and 3-17 overall, is led by Mike Scott (6-2 
senior, 11.7 points) and Matt Halme (5-11 senior, 10.3).

UP, DOWN OXNARD PERPLEXES MCCARTHY 
</P>

<P>
Oxnard College's inconsistency has frustrated Coach Remy McCarthy to the point 
where the second-year coach isn't sure what kind of Condor team will take the 
floor in games at El Camino and Chaffey this week. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard has beaten strong teams such as L.A. City, Hancock, and MiraCosta. But 
the Condors have been beaten by mediocre teams like Porterville and San Diego 
City. 
</P>
<P>
"We've beaten some of the best teams in the state, then turned around and lost 
to some of the worst," McCarthy said. "It's a little puzzling." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy was scratching his head after a 71-70 loss to San Diego City on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"With all due respect to San Diego City's players and coach, they just aren't a 
very strong team," McCarthy said. "That's a team we have to beat. I don't care 
if their coach's brother and sister-in-law are the referees." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard, however, came back with a win over a talented MiraCosta team. 
</P>
<P>
"The only good thing that I can possibly say is that we got our act together 
and beat a good team." 
</P>
<P>
Slowly but surely: Ventura College, which lost two championship games in its 
previous three tournaments this season, finally won a trophy Saturday when it 
beat Rio Hondo for the consolation championship of the Pasadena tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura lost to Rancho Santiago in overtime, then rebounded with a win over 
fourth-ranked El Camino and a blowout of Rio Hondo for the consolation title. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hardware, but the wrong kind of hardware," Ventura Coach Phil Mathews 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mathews said the inexperienced Pirates are slowly developing into the type of 
team he wants to put on the hardwood when Western State Conference play begins 
Jan. 3 at Cuesta. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the potential to be good," Mathews said. "We just aren't doing the 
things that elite teams have to do to win ballgames." 
</P>
<P>
Lester Neal grabbed a season-high 20 rebounds in the loss to Rancho Santiago 
and came back with a 15-rebound effort in the win over El Camino. Ventura will 
be without Reggie Betton for seven weeks because Betton re-injured a stress 
fracture in his right shin. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty deep in the first place, and guys like Terrence Lamb, Uba 
Satterfield, and Dijon Bernard have picked up the slack," Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura will compete in the L.A. Valley tournament this week. It met Trade Tech 
at 6 p.m. Tuesday, with the winner meeting the Hancock-L.A. City victor on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
No signings: According to Steve Tobias, Ventura College's defensive 
coordinator, no Pirates have signed letters-of-intent since the signing period 
began two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of offers out there, and still a lot of visits in the works," 
Tobias said. Tobias doesn't expect any Pirate commitments to Division I or II 
schools until January, when the players have been able to use all of their 
visits to universities. 
</P>
<P>
Back on defense: One of Ventura County's hardest working coaches, Dick Sebek of 
Nordhoff High, will spend the next week flat on his back recuperating from 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Sebek, the Rangers boys' basketball coach, underwent his second back surgery in 
three years Monday at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Sebek will miss the Rangers' game Friday at Bishop Diego and possibly next 
week's Ventura tournament. The team will be run by Mike Probyn, the junior 
varsity coach. 
</P>
<P>
Nordhoff won the Fillmore tournament last week by defeating the host team in 
the final. 
</P>
<P>
Sebek said he first felt back pains three years ago and had an operation to 
repair a herniated disc. Monday's operation was to remove scar tissue, Sebek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The pain flaired up about three months ago," Sebek said. "It came down to 
having the surgery now or in two months when the season is over. The pain was 
bad and my doctor said it wasn't worth the risk to wait. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily, the operation worked with our schedule and I should only miss one 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Football honors: Santa Clara High quarterback Tim Gutierrez, who threw for 
2,960 yards and 18 touchdowns in 13 games, was selected co-player of the year 
in the Southern Section Division VIII. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez's career total of 7,272 yards placed him third on the Southern 
Section all-time list, fifth in state and ninth nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez, a 6-3 senior who passed for 52 touchdowns, shared the MVP honor with 
senior Tim Manning of Trabuco Hills, who won its second consecutive divisional 
title with a 13-7 win over Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Both were selected to the first team last season. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara, which was 10-3 overall, was eliminated by Trabuco Hills in the 
semifinals, 48-21. 
</P>
<P>
Lineman Ted Lawrence, the son of first-year coach Larry Lawrence, all-purpose 
player Kwinn Knight, and kicker Aaron Clark were other Saints selected to the 
first team. 
</P>
<P>
In Division IX, Tory Cabral of Fillmore was the only offensive player selected 
to the first team from the Ventura County area. Defensive lineman Victor 
Magdaleno and Linebackers Mike Kozar of Fillmore and Tom Uphoff of Moorpark 
were picked for the defensive team. 
</P>
<P>
Cabral rushed for 1,555 yards in 188 carries to lead Ventura County in yardage. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching a Milestone: Lou Cvijanovich, Santa Clara High's basketball coach of 
37 years, doesn't keep track of Shon Tarver's scoring statistics or those of 
any of his players for that matter. He also doesn't keep track of his own 
milestones, which made Dec. 11th an interesting evening for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
In the same night Tarver set a school-record with a 44-point performance, 
Cvijanovich earned his 600th coaching victory during a 72-56 win over Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Both achievements would have gone unnoticed if Cvijanovich were the sports 
curator for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Tarver passed the previous school mark of 43 points set by Gil 
Cruz in the early 50s. 
</P>
<P>
Since the victory, Cvijanovich has added four more wins to raise his total to 
604. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Armstrong is the only other coach in state history with more than 600 
wins. Armstrong had an 858-273 overall record while coaching at six differents 
schools during his 40-year career. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a successful weekend trip to San Diego, the Saints will be looking 
for their eighth straight win without a loss Friday night at Rio Mesa.

VENICE CO-COACHES AL DELLINGER, TONY CHRETIN HONORED, LONG WITH LOUIS JONES AND 
SANTA MONICA'S ERIC BANDUCCI; 
</P>
<P>
PREPS: THE GLEN DAVIS AWARD, FOR THE TOP HIGH SCHOOL PLAYER IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA, WAS GIVEN TO THE LATE KEVIN COPELAND OF DORSEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Venice Co-Coaches Al Dellinger and Tony Chretin and their quarterback, Louis 
Jones, and Santa Monica center Eric Banducci won the top Westside honors at the 
annual Times high school football awards brunch. 
</P>
<P>
Dellinger and Chretin were named the area's coaches of the year, Jones back of 
the year and Banducci lineman of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The late Kevin Copeland of Dorsey High was honored in memory with the third 
annual Glenn Davis Award, given to the top high school football player in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Copeland, a wide receiver who was considered one of the top players in the 
state, collapsed and later died from heart failure during a game against San 
Pedro this season. He was 17. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey, which had dedicated its season to Copeland, won its first Los Angeles 
City 4-A Division championship last week, defeating Carson, 26-15. 
</P>
<P>
The invitational event, sponsored by the Los Angeles Times Fund, brought 
together parents, head coaches and 276 players from all-star first teams in 12 
Times circulation areas: Westside, Central, Inland Empire (Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties), Orange County, San Gabriel Valley, Southeast, South 
Coast, Glendale, South Bay, San Fernando Valley, San Diego County and Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Each player received a plaque and certificate. In addition, the backs and 
linemen of the year received trophies. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Dellinger, 49, has been named a Times coach of the 
year. In 1977 he was honored as head coach of a Venice team that was undefeated 
in the regular season, won the Western League championship and finished the 
year with a 9-1-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
The 1977 Gondoliers had several star players, including some who went on to 
college football and some who also played professionally. They included 
defensive back Dana McLemore (University of Hawaii, San Francisco 49ers), 
running back Keyvan Jenkins (Nevada Las Vegas, Canadian Football League), 
running back-defensive back Kinyon Jenkins, Keyvan's brother, (Nevada Las 
Vegas, San Diego State), quarterback Antonio Gasca (Santa Monica College, Cal 
State Long Beach) and offensive linemen Darryl Moore (USC) and Jeff Pew 
(Oregon). 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Venice team may not have had as many stars, but it had an 11-1 record. 
This year's players, Dellinger said, "got maximum mileage out of their ability. 
We also had a very, very good offensive line, a better offensive line" than 
that of the 1977 team. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of UCLA, Dellinger was an offensive lineman at University High 
School and Santa Monica College. He began coaching as a volunteer assistant at 
Palisades High School in 1966, was head coach at Fairfax High from 1967 to 
1971, became an assistant at Venice in 1971 and went on to serve at Venice as a 
co-coach, head coach and co-coach again this year with Chretin. 
</P>
<P>
Chretin, 37, played and coached on undefeated Venice B teams, became a varsity 
assistant in 1984 and moved to co-coach in charge of the defense this season as 
Dellinger handled the duties of offensive coordinator. Chretin is a graduate of 
Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Dellinger said that Jones, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound senior, was the "best 
all-around player" he has seen in 25 years of coaching and was the catalyst for 
Venice's strong season. 
</P>
<P>
A converted wide receiver, Jones moved to quarterback this year and continued 
to be a fine defensive back. He didn't pass often (37 completions in 87 
attempts for 416 yards and five touchdowns). But he ran often and well (96 
carries, 769 yards and 14 touchdowns), and he always ran the show. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was the Gondoliers' leading tackler in the secondary, had eight sacks and 
five interceptions and forced four fumbles. He also handled the punting and 
kicking. 
</P>
<P>
Banducci, who was a defensive lineman as well as a center, is a grandson of the 
late Bruno Banducci, who was a top lineman with the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Tebb Kusserow, Santa Monica High coach, said Banducci is an "excellent blocker 
with great quickness and strength." The 6-3, 240-pound senior was the leading 
tackler on the Vikings' line. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Jones and Banducci, The Times' All-Westside first team on offense 
includes wide receivers Anthony Cope of Palisades and John Aylsworth of Santa 
Monica and linemen Darren Johnson of Westchester, Julio Diaz of Venice, Noah R. 
Kaiser of Westchester and Brian Gorski of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
The first-team running backs are Damone Ewell of St. Monica, John Haqq of 
Culver City and Tim Holliday of Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, the first team includes linemen Todd Kusserow of Santa Monica, 
Bryan McElroy of Palisades, Floyd Hines of St. Bernard and Devon Sando of 
Beverly Hills and linebackers Henry (Butch) Hahn of Westchester, Michael 
Curutchet of St. Monica and Art Cabral of Venice. 
</P>
<P>
In the first-team defensive backfield are Albert (Lefty) Jones of St. Monica, 
Greg Hooks of Culver City, Lamar K. Lyons II of St. Monica and Terence Sullivan 
of St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
The second team on offense has wide receivers John Song of Beverly Hills and 
Kyle Bryant of University and linemen Bryan Orange of Hamilton, Payam Saadat of 
St. Monica, Charles Geitzen of Hamilton, Nigel Mills of Venice and Hassan Allen 
of Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Aylsworth of Santa Monica (John's brother) is the second-team quarterback, 
and the running backs are Mario Mattison of Fairfax, Walter Grissam of 
Westchester and Robert Hughes of University. The kicker is Culver City punter 
Rick Heineman. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, the second-team linemen are Humberto Irigoyen of Daniel Murphy, 
Antonio Johnson of Culver City, Wes Smith of Westchester and Fabrice Perzik of 
Beverly Hills. The linebackers are Matt Schmitter of Santa Monica, Alex Kahan 
of Beverly Hills and Dominic Walker of Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive backs are Troy Dunlap of Culver City, Lerone McElrath of Venice, 
Keith Walk Green of St. Monica and Tharen Todd of Fairfax.

<P>
The first Pacific gray whales of the migration season passed close to shore 
Tuesday morning and were sighted by anglers aboard South Bay sportfishing 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
The whales migrate from the Bering Sea to Baja California lagoons where they 
mate before returning to the Arctic. 
</P>
<P>
Again this year all South Bay sportfishing landings will begin whale watching 
trips Dec. 26 and continue seven days a week until April. 
</P>
<P>
Each trip is led by naturalists trained by the Cabrillo Marine Museum. For more 
information call (213) 832-2676. For reservations and schedules call any South 
Bay sportfishing landing that runs daily trips. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers don't always have enough tackle when they try for scrappy game fish. 
Here are suggestions to give the avid angler on your gift list: 
</P>
<P>
New reel, spools of 10- to 80-pound test line, tackle box with assorted hooks, 
jigs, casting rod or trolling rod and as a stocking stuffer a fishing video. 
</P>
<P>

RAIDER BID DOESN'T DEPEND ON BROWNS

<P>
Despite the NFL's previous explanation, the Raiders do not need a loss by the 
Cleveland Browns to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
There are other scenarios possible. However, all depend on the Raiders beating 
the New York Giants Sunday at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, if the Raiders win and Indianapolis loses at New Orleans Sunday 
and Cincinnati loses at Minnesota Monday night, the Raiders would be in. 
</P>
<P>
Thus no matter what happens in Saturday night's Browns-Oilers game at Houston, 
the Raiders will be alive Sunday. MARK HEISLER

<P>
RAIDERS: THREE VETERANS HAVE CLOUDY STATUS GOING INTO FINAL REGULAR-SEASON GAME 
SUNDAY AGAINST THE NEW YORK GIANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
An era is passing before our eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the 11th-hour deal in 1983, when Al Davis hornswoggled the New England 
Patriots out of Mike Haynes and paired him with Lester Hayes to form the finest 
cornerback tandem the game had ever seen? 
</P>
<P>
Hayes is gone and likely up to Chapter Eight in "Coach Davis and Other Geniuses 
I Have Known," his soon-to-be-published autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes departs Sunday in a rare on-the-field appearance. An injury to Russell 
Carter and a dearth of experienced cornerbacks means that at least he can go 
out with his cleats on. 
</P>
<P>
Now, remember 1982, their first season in Los Angeles, when rookies Marcus 
Allen and Vann McElroy tangled daily in camp? 
</P>
<P>
Allen may be playing his last Raider game Sunday. He wants out, and Davis 
wouldn't mind letting him out. 
</P>
<P>
McElroy? 
</P>
<P>
Let's just say the Raiders have had him in their cross-hairs since training 
camp, when he suffered a hip injury and wasn't allowed to practice until he 
signed an addendum to his contract, consenting to take about $10,000 less than 
was due him for any game he missed because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
After that, he tore a hamstring in Game 4. Eligible to return after Game 10, he 
was held out until Game 13, a saving to the club of another $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
McElroy now is on the kickoff team and plays sporadically on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Color another great Raider career silver, black and almost over. 
</P>
<P>
"I came into training camp, and, basically, I think the intention there was to 
replace me," McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a minor injury there and I couldn't practice until I signed that 
particular deal. There was nothing I could do. I was on the 
physically-unable-to-perform list, and that's a list where you're kind of 
stuck. You're in limbo because you don't get paid. They can leave you on that 
for the rest of your life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was totally surprised. It's not like I hadn't done anything in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he shouldn't have been surprised. A two-time Pro Bowler, in 1983 and '84, 
and an alternate as late as '86, McElroy missed four games with injuries in 
'88. Davis had liked the speedier Eddie Anderson since the day in 1986 when he 
showed up with the strike team. 
</P>
<P>
When McElroy was injured this season, Anderson broke into the lineup 
spectacularly. He has five interceptions, two returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he is no match for McElroy as a leader and coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
But then, the Raiders don't care. Strong safety Mike Harden now calls defensive 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, McElroy sat . . . and sat . . . and sat. 
</P>
<P>
"When I played this season, I was graded basically as the top defensive back," 
he said. "Everyone was saying, 'Man, you're back, you're playing Pro Bowl 
football, you're playing great.' All this stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, all of a sudden, I get this partially torn hamstring, and nothing's ever 
said to me again. No one tells me anything. Then I come back in six weeks and 
I'm eligible. I'm ready to play, completely healthy, and, basically, the idea 
is, 'Well, we're just going to sort of leave you there.' 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing was ever said. I was never told anything really by anybody in that 
period of time. I would ask and ask and ask. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough. You're in a situation when you've been elected captain. I was 
trying to fill a role here, too. I didn't want to develop an attitude, be a 
problem and start stirring up a bunch of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I just kind of sat back, made all the meetings, practiced hard, did 
all I was supposed to do, made them fully aware of the fact I was ready to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get into a big controversy now. It's the last game of the 
season. It's a big game for this team. Let the focus be on the game we have to 
play. This is a huge game for this organization, in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
The remarkable thing about this story is that the Raiders always prided 
themselves on taking care of their own. People who crossed them or held out, 
such as Allen; or sued them, such as Bill Lewis, did so at their own peril. 
</P>
<P>
But McElroy didn't. The minister's kid from Uvalde, Tex., remains the same 
leave-my-heart-on-your-doorstep performer he has always been. 
</P>
<P>
"This game has really been my life," McElroy said. "You just ask my wife. I 
live this game from morning till late at night. I go home and, if I'm not 
watching film, I'm thinking about different things in the game. During the 
season, I'm just so wrapped up. During the off-season, I work my butt off, just 
trying to be the type of player they expect me to be and have been. 
</P>
<P>
"When Art (Shell) was picked as head coach, man, I was so fired up because I 
felt the team was going to start in the direction of the old Raiders. Man, that 
was exciting! Just the little things he did right off the bat. It became fun. 
We started winning again in the Raider style. That was really hard. I was so 
excited for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had so much respect for the organization, for the people who have been 
here before us, for my teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I'll go out there and I may not do it right every time, but if 
somebody's in a fight or somebody's going down, I'll be the first guy to be 
there at their backs. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think I'll be back. I'd like to be, but I just don't foresee 
it. If I'm going to be treated the way I've been treated, I don't want to be. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at a guy like Marcus Allen, who's given his life to this team. You 
look at guys like Matt Millen, Bill Pickel. Those are guys who really live and 
die this stuff. They've given nothing but their all to this team and this 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
McElroy has one more game to give his all to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Then, we'll see where the shakeout takes them all -- Haynes, Allen, McElroy, 
the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Howie Long, who didn't start until the seventh game of the 
season, is the only Raider Pro Bowl selection, behind AFC starters Bruce Smith 
of Buffalo and Lee Williams of San Diego. Long has made the Pro Bowl six times 
since 1983, missing only last year when a calf injury cost him half the season. 
Said Long: "I'm most proud of the fact that I got it in my mind that I was just 
going to suck it up and do everything I possibly could do -- not necessarily 
pointed in the direction of the Pro Bowl, just to play." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Art Shell protested the passing-over of running back Bo Jackson, 
linebacker Greg Townsend and wide receiver Mervyn Fernandez. "I think if you 
take a guy like Bo, you put him up there with the rest of those guys that made 
it and you ask each player which guy would you rather have, I'm sure 99% would 
say Bo. . . . I've always felt that it was great when the coaches voted for the 
Pro Bowl (rather than the players, who do it now). The coaches around the 
league know the players better than the players do. That's my personal 
opinion."

INJURED CHANG HOPEFUL HE CAN PLAY IN DAVIS CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Michael Chang will be on crutches for two more weeks, but he is optimistic that 
his injured left hip may heal in time for him to play in the Davis Cup matches 
in early February. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll be back on the court earlier than was first thought," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have to wait and see until after Christmas, after I have some more 
X-rays. There is an outside chance of playing Davis Cup." 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old French Open champion was injured Dec. 6 while practicing in 
Florida. He was expected to be out for eight weeks after it was diagnosed that 
he had broken his hip where the top of the thigh bone enters the socket. 
</P>
<P>
However, Chang's orthopedic specialist, Dr. Robert Kerlan, said he believes 
Chang did not suffer a fracture, but instead experienced a separation of bone 
in the area of his left hip socket. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel there has been some movement, but not a great deal," Kerlan said. 
</P>
<P>
The portion of bone affected was "a pretty sizable piece," Kerlan said, 
indicating it was about half the length of a finger. "We feel it was held in 
place by very tough connective tissue." 
</P>
<P>
The injury occurred as Chang stretched for a two-handed backhand shot deep in 
the corner of the court. He did not fall or run into anything. Chang said he 
heard something crack. 
</P>
<P>
Kerlan, who said he sees no need for surgery, said it is too early to decide 
whether Chang will be able to play for the U.S. Davis Cup team against Mexico 
Feb. 2-4 at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Chang was cautious about sounding too sure he would be able to play in the 
first-round matches. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of risky to not play for so many weeks and the first thing you do is 
play Davis Cup," he said. "I've been told that for every day you miss, it takes 
three days to get back to that form you were in. 
</P>
<P>
"So, I guess I'll just have to wait and see."

CAIN MORE THAN ABLE TO PLAY SENIOR TOUR; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: STOCKBROKER NEVER COMPETED ON REGULAR TOUR, BUT HE'S HOLDING HIS OWN WITH 
50-AND-OLDER SET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As a stockbroker, John Paul Cain worried about such things as the market 
dropping 500 points. In his new profession, he worries about dropping five-foot 
putts. 
</P>
<P>
Cain, who did not become a professional golfer until after his 52nd birthday, 
is having the time of his life on the Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
At 53, a rookie on the 50-and-older tour, Cain will play in the Tournament of 
Champions at La Costa, which starts the new professional golf season Jan. 4. 
The field is composed of tournament winners only and is the only event in which 
regular tour players and seniors play on the same course at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Although he finished only 15th in the 1988 qualifying tournament, Cain was a 
Monday qualifier before winning the Greater Grand Rapids Open with a 
10-under-par 203 the weekend of July 14-16. He called it just about the most 
exciting thing that ever happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
Cain, a stockbroker in Houston for 30 years before trying pro golf on the 
advice of several members of the senior tour, shot a five-under 66 on the final 
round, winning from three shots back. He joined Larry Mowry as the only players 
to win a tournament after qualifying on a Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He is a slender, gray-haired man with a slight trace of a stomach. Although he 
is only 5-feet-10 and weighs about 150, he hits the ball a long way. When he 
putts well, he can play with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I have exceeded expectations," Cain said. "I just wanted to find out if I 
could compete on the senior tour. My goal was to qualify for a few tournaments 
and make a respectable showing. I did not anticipate winning a tournament. It 
was a fantastic feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't believe the fun I'm having. I don't feel any pressure out here. But 
when you have a $50-million portfolio and are in the market with other people's 
money, that's pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't in the market just playing with rich guys' money. Some of my 
investors were putting all their savings in my hands." 
</P>
<P>
Becoming a professional golfer, however, was not just a whim. And even after 
urging from Gay Brewer, Bob Rawlings, Butch Baird and others to give it a shot, 
Cain couldn't make the decision by himself. 
</P>
<P>
"When I really decided I wanted to try during the 1988 U.S. Senior Open at 
Medinah (near Chicago), I sat down and talked to my wife," Cain said. "Our two 
daughters are grown up, so that wasn't a problem. Carol told me to go for it. 
Next, I had to talk to Smith Barney, the company I worked for, and my clients. 
</P>
<P>
"Smith Barney made me an independent contractor so that I could give golf a 
try. I've turned over a majority of my clients to my business partner. None of 
the clients thought I should not give golf a try." 
</P>
<P>
Money wasn't a factor. Cain had done well as a broker. From his business, he 
has a six-figure income. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't in this for money," he said. "It wasn't an ego trip. Or maybe it was. 
I was out to see if I could compete. I have answered that to my satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
By winning at Grand Rapids, Cain earned an exemption from qualifying for a 
year. He wound up his rookie season with more than $140,000, which put him 30th 
on the money list and made him eligible for all tour events next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, you can see why it's so much fun," Cain said. "Just think, I'm out here 
playing with Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Bob Charles and other famous golfers. 
Isn't it something? 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't learn anything else, I learned that you can't be too prepared. 
Before I went to qualifying school, I was spending maybe 10 to 15 hours a week 
on the golf course. These guys spend all their time working on their game. You 
aren't going to compete with Chi Chi Rodriguez and Orville Moody by being 
halfway prepared." 
</P>
<P>
When he was at Texas Tech, Cain competed in amateur events with Don Massengale, 
Baird and other top Texas golfers. He briefly toyed with the idea of turning 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
"But in the late 1950s, Palmer, the leading money winner, was earning about 
$32,000," Cain said. "I had worked as a stockbroker in the summers while at 
Texas Tech and I knew I could make more money than that." 
</P>
<P>
Cain won the Texas Amateur, competed in four U.S. Opens and 11 U.S. Amateurs, 
but it was not until he began qualifying for the U.S. Senior Open that he 
started thinking seriously about trying to make it on the mushrooming tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I didn't make it at qualifying school in 1988, I hit the ball as well 
as just about anyone," Cain said. "I putted like a dog. 
</P>
<P>
"Then came the breakthrough at Grand Rapids. I think there was some resentment 
at first when an amateur joined the tour. But when I proved I could play, I 
didn't notice any. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into the final round at Grand Rapids three strokes behind. I shot a 31 
on the front side to take the lead. Then, my putter, which had been so hot all 
week, failed me. I three-putted twice in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fortunate to be playing with an old friend, Bruce Crampton. He gave me 
encouragement, saying I could birdie some holes ahead." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't imagine how the win felt. One of the first thoughts was that I 
wouldn't have to qualify on Monday anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, it made me eligible for the Tournament of Champions. Even if I play 
poorly at La Costa, I will start the year making a payday." 
</P>
<P>
And for at least another year, the stock market will have to wait.

MAYBE IT'S TIME PLAYOFF TIEBREAKERS WERE SETTLED ON THE FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than ever this year, the National Football League appears to be on the 
wrong postseason track. 
</P>
<P>
After turning up a record number of playoff contenders, the league is still 
using its old tiebreaker formula to decide among them. 
</P>
<P>
It seems obvious that, in the interests of justice for all, the pros should 
play off ties -- particularly division-leading ties -- whenever possible. And 
it's usually possible. 
</P>
<P>
This season, for instance, Green Bay and Minnesota both will finish 10-6 in the 
NFC Central if they win their final games this weekend against Dallas and 
Cincinnati, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
But under NFL rules, Minnesota will be the division champion, and, unless it 
gets a lot of help elsewhere, Green Bay will be out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
If it happens that way, it won't be fair to the Packers, who have had a fine 
season. And it won't be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
For if Green Bay and Minnesota are still tied on wild-card Sunday -- which 
falls on New Year's Eve this year -- there could well be, and ought to be, a 
Packer-Viking playoff in place of any artificial wild-card meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Most 1989 races are so close that, if the NFL were using games instead of a 
formula to break ties, there might be as many as three other division playoffs 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
Eight teams are still alive for first places in the AFC East, AFC Central and 
NFC East: Buffalo, Miami and Indianapolis (all 8-7); Houston (9-6), Cleveland 
(8-6-1) and Cincinnati (8-7), and the New York Giants (11-4) and Philadelphia 
(10-5). 
</P>
<P>
A different procedure is recommended: 
</P>
<P>
 -- All two-team ties should be played off on the Sunday after the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With a three-team tie, the present tiebreaking formula eliminates one of 
the three. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The formula otherwise applies -- if necessary -- to shape a playoff 
structure with eight teams replacing the present 10. 
</P>
<P>
Taking one possible example, there would be more interest -- and, potentially, 
more money -- in a Cincinnati-Houston rematch New Year's Eve than in any 
conceivable wild-card matchup. 
</P>
<P>
The feuding coaches, Sam Wyche of Cincinnati and Jerry Glanville of Houston, 
might even be persuaded to settle that one on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
If the favorites all win this weekend, the league's 1989-90 playoffs would 
begin with these 10 teams: 
</P>
<P>
 -- NFC champions: San Francisco, Minnesota and New York Giants. Wild cards: 
Rams and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 -- AFC champions: Denver, Houston and Buffalo. Wild cards: Miami and 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
In such a field, the playoffs would start with these wild-card games Dec. 31: 
Rams at Philadelphia, 9:30 a.m.; Cleveland at Miami, 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Coming up: 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 6-7 -- The NFC's two travelers -- the wild-card winner and Minnesota or 
Green Bay -- would play either at San Francisco or at the New York Giants. 
Assuming all AFC favorites continue to win, the AFC wild card would be at 
Denver, with Buffalo at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 14 -- San Francisco and Denver would be favored to play host to the 
conference championship games. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 28 -- The 49ers would remain the Super Bowl favorite in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL has never had a season to match this one. On the one hand, the league 
has come up with the dominating team that its critics have demanded for years, 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, NFL parity is even more widespread. 
</P>
<P>
In the decades when former commissioner Pete Rozelle helped tailor the rules to 
make every team a potential Super Bowl winner, the largest number of contenders 
the league ever had in the season's final week was 16 -- and it had that many 
only once. 
</P>
<P>
Today it has 17. After all this time, only 11 of the 28 ballclubs have been 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
The top 20 or 21 are so evenly matched that it didn't help last week to have a 
significant playoff incentive. Six teams that thought they had taken charge of 
their own destiny all lost -- Minnesota, Houston, Buffalo, Philadelphia, Kansas 
City and the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who needed only to keep winning to reach the playoffs, there was 
one winner over the weekend, the Giants. And the Giants had only Dallas to 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
So the favorites in this week's final regular-season games aren't necessarily 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
Any of five underdogs -- Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, the Raiders or 
Kansas City -- could still bump Cleveland or somebody out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The results of a crazy season suggest that at the Meadowlands Sunday, the 
Giants have the edge, but the Raiders have a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis replaced Kansas City this week as the AFC entry with the most 
momentum. Last Sunday, when the team that Steve Ortmayer built, the San Diego 
Chargers, upset the Chiefs at Kansas City, the Colts routed the co-leader of 
the AFC East, Miami, 42-13. 
</P>
<P>
And suddenly, after what seemed to be a down season for the Colts, they are in 
position to make the playoffs, if they can overcome a giant-killer Sunday in 
New Orleans, where the Saints upset Philadelphia Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
In a best-case scenario, the Colts could even win the division if Buffalo loses 
to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric Dickerson getting healthy and coming back was the key," Coach Ron Meyer 
said after the former Ram gained 107 yards against Miami, catching Jim Brown in 
100-yard games with 58. 
</P>
<P>
Another key has been the work of backup quarterback Jack Trudeau after Meyer 
shifted gears and went for short passes as the Colt staple, replacing his 
cherished running game. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody has been expecting much of the Colts since September, when they were 
clubbed by the 49ers and the Rams in their first two starts, then lost 
quarterback Chris Chandler for the season with a knee injury in the third week. 
</P>
<P>
Next, a hamstring injury slowed Dickerson, who hasn't been himself since 
October. And at various times, Trudeau has been knocked out with a broken 
finger, two split fingers, a shoulder injury and a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
Through all their misery, the Colts kept fighting back, leaving one final 
question for 1989: This time, can they handle a good NFC team -- the New 
Orleans defensive unit that just brushed off Philadelphia? 
</P>
<P>
The rise of the Detroit Lions under Coach Wayne Fontes has some of them feeling 
giddy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think at this point we're playing the best ball in the league," nose tackle 
Jerry Ball told Detroit reporters the other day. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to the Lions' final game, tackle Lomas Brown said: "We want to 
blow Atlanta out." 
</P>
<P>
They didn't have much trouble with Tampa Bay last week, in any case, winning, 
33-7, to tie Chicago for third in the NFC Central. Both have 6-9 records. 
</P>
<P>
But while 6-9 depresses Chicago Coach Mike Ditka, it greatly cheers Fontes and 
his offensive coordinator, Mouse Davis, the run-and-shoot expert who has 
established his favorite offense in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"People were talking about wanting Mouse Davis' head," linebacker Chris 
Spielman said, referring to the Lions' 0-5 start when they were neck and neck 
with Dallas. "Now we're getting used to winning." 
</P>
<P>
Fontes is the Lions' ninth coach since their last championship in 1957, and for 
a while this season it looked as if somebody would shortly make it 10. But 
after opening 1-8, the Lions have won five of their last six, defeating, among 
others, the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
So doing, Fontes and Davis may have proved two things: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The run and shoot is a viable NFL offense. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It is as much an offense for runners as it is for passers. A Detroit 
rookie, Barry Sanders, running primarily draw plays out of the run and shoot, 
has become the NFC's leading ground-gainer.

AUSTRALIAN HAD HIS TIMING DOWN, BUT HIS RECORD BID IS UP IN THE AIR

After 100 meters in a preliminary heat of the 1,500-meter freestyle at the 
Australian Commonwealth Games trials last week, Glen Housman knew something 
special was happening. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was in front of a world-record pace and thought, what the heck, let's 
go for it," Housman told the Sydney Morning Herald. "I just put my head down 
and kept swimming and swimming." 
</P>
<P>
When the race was over, Housman's time was 14 minutes 53.59 seconds, which was 
1.17 seconds under Soviet swimmer Vladimir Salnikov's world record of 14:54.76. 
However, Housman's finishing touch did not stop the electronic timing system, 
so his time was not recognized by FINA, the sport's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
Most timing systems at big meets are equipped with a backup electronic timing 
device that starts with the gun and is stopped by the timers at the end of the 
race; however, this meet had no electronic backup. Housman's time was 
determined by taking the middle time of the three timers' hand-held 
stopwatches. The times were 14:53.57, 14:53.59 and 14:53.60. 
</P>
<P>
Because the times on the watches were so close and the time was considerably 
under the existing mark, the Australian Institute of Sport filed a petition 
with FINA to have the record allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"We will undertake every possible action to see that the record is acknowledged 
by the world governing body," Craig McLatchey, executive director of the 
Australian institute, told the Sydney newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the FINA technical committee, Roger Smith, was the meet director, 
and he will endorse the petition. "I have been officiating swimming carnivals 
for the past 30 years and I have never struck this kind of thing before," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Housman, 18, became the second swimmer to go under 15 minutes in the 1,500. 
Salnikov, who won the 1,500 in the 1980 and 1988 Olympics, has been under 15 
minutes four times. Several swimmers have been close, including George Dicarlo, 
who holds the American record of 15:01.51. 
</P>
<P>
One of the highlights of this year's U.S. Open, held earlier this month at the 
Justice Aquatic Center in Orlando Fla., was the return of Troy Dalbey. Swimming 
for the first time since last year's Seoul Olympics, Dalbey won the 100-meter 
freestyle and was second in the 200-meter freestyle, with times close to what 
he swam to make the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Dalbey, a double gold-medalist in 1988, was banned from competing in United 
States Swimming-sanctioned meets for a year after he was caught taking a statue 
from a bar in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Because he had been away from competitive swimming for so long, Dalbey was 
unsure of how he would perform in the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an important meet for me, as far as my confidence went," Dalbey said. 
"If I didn't do well there, I wasn't sure I'd ever have enough confidence to 
win again." 
</P>
<P>
Dalbey has also returned to school. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1987 NCAA meet, as a freshman at Florida, Dalbey was runner-up to Matt 
Biondi in the 100-yard and 200-yard freestyles. His time in the 200 made him 
the second-fastest performer in that event. 
</P>
<P>
Dalbey took the next year off to train for the Olympics. When he returned, he 
decided that he did not want to re-enroll at Florida. Instead, he enrolled at 
BYU. After living in Provo, Utah, for two months, he decided that the area was 
not to his liking. His next stop was Arizona State, where he is now. 
</P>
<P>
He did little training initially but has been in the water regularly this 
semester. Ron Johnson, the Sun Devil coach, is glad to have Dalbey on the team. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the type of swimmer who can make a program by himself," Johnson said. 
"He can swim anything but is especially good in the middle-distance freestyles 
and on the relays." 
</P>
<P>
Under NCAA rules, Dalbey could not compete for ASU this semester. Starting with 
next semester, he has 1 1/2 years of eligibility left. Dalbey lost a year 
because Florida would not release him from his scholarship. ASU is petitioning 
the NCAA to have one year of eligibility restored on the basis of an NCAA rule 
that states if an athlete takes a year out of school to train for the Olympics 
and makes the team, the year does not count against him. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Dalbey is having fun swimming again. He plans to help ASU do as 
well as it can and keep swimming toward the next Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Mark Spitz announced that he was returning to swimming and aiming 
for a spot on the 1992 Olympic team in the 100-meter butterfly. Because Spitz 
is interested in just the one event, and possibly a relay, he enlisted the help 
of UCLA men's Coach Ron Ballatore, one of the top sprint coaches in America. 
</P>
<P>
After five months, Spitz says he is progressing well, training five days a week 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing fine. The big thing is not to get into (training) too quickly," 
Spitz said. "I've got a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Spitz last raced was in 1972 at the Montreal Olympics, where he won four 
individual events and was on three winning relay teams. Spitz chose the 
100-meter butterfly because it was his best event. His world record in 
Montreal, 54.27 seconds, stood until 1977, when Joe Bottom swam 54.18. 
</P>
<P>
Spitz expects to enter his first race sometime in the spring but won't be 
concerned with how he does. "In swimming, you don't really get your act 
together until the end of the season," Spitz said, "and since I'm shooting for 
1992, I've got a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Swimming Notes 
</P>
<P>
Several Southland collegiate swimmers will compete in the Perth International 
Invitational meet at Perth, Australia, Jan. 5-7. Ray Looze and Brad Askins of 
USC, and Mark Dean of UCLA will represent the United States, and Erik Ran of 
USC will swim for the Netherlands. The American swimmers, 25 men and 18 women, 
will leave Dec. 27 and attend a training camp before the meet. A U.S. 
long-distance team will compete in a 25-kilometer race in the Swan River, which 
runs through Perth. 
</P>
<P>
USC sophomore Gary Anderson won the 200-meter individual medley, was second in 
the 200-meter backstroke and qualified for the Canadian team that will compete 
in the Commonwealth Games at Auckland, New Zealand, Jan. 24-Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest college swimming rankings, the Stanford women are first, just 
ahead of Texas. UCLA is ninth and USC eleventh. On the men's side, Texas is 
first, with USC second and Stanford third. UCLA is 10th.

Angel outfielder Claudell Washington was arrested Wednesday for investigation 
of spousal battery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, 35, was arrested after his wife, Cynthia, called police, Orinda 
Police Sgt. Hank Davis said. Under California law, Washington was charged with 
a felony because his wife had visible injuries, Davis said, adding that bail 
was set at $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's wife suffered a "knot on the head, a cut lip and she might have a 
black eye," according to Davis, who said she was taken to John Muir Memorial 
Hospital for treatment but was not admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Washington was arrested at his home and offered no resistance, Davis said. He 
and his wife have been married since 1975.

MANDATORY RECYCLING OF L.A. HOUSEHOLD TRASH OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking out the trash, that most wearisome of weekly chores, is about to become 
a more challenging proposition as the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday 
approved a landmark mandatory trash recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
After the unanimous vote, Mayor Tom Bradley said he will sign the measure into 
law, setting into motion one of the largest urban recycling projects in the 
nation. The program, at a cost to taxpayers of $160 million, will be phased in 
over three years. 
</P>
<P>
The recycling proposal, the subject of two years of practical planning and 
political debate, is intended to cut in half the amount of trash deposited in 
the city's rapidly filling dumps. 
</P>
<P>
It would require all 720,000 single-family households in the city to separate 
glass and plastic bottles, aluminum cans and newspaper into different 
containers for curbside collection. Reusable materials will eventually be sold 
by the city to recyclers. 
</P>
<P>
"The era of the disposable society, when cans and papers can be carelessly 
tossed aside, is coming to an end," Bradley said. "Through this plan, the city 
now establishes a 'no-excuses-accepted' policy when it comes to recycling. We 
will make it easy for all to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
Many pragmatic details have yet to be worked out, including what to do with the 
trash generated by apartment dwellers and disposal of grass clippings and the 
like. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal was introduced before the council Wednesday to consider forcing 
private trash haulers in the city to also recycle. Currently, waste produced by 
businesses and apartment buildings with more than six units is collected by 
private haulers, and it accounts for about two-thirds of all waste generated in 
Los Angeles. The private trash hauler proposal is not expected to be resolved 
for months or even years. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in September, 1990, however, homeowners in Eagle Rock and El Sereno 
will be the first required under the law to have their trash separated for 
pickup by specially retrofitted sanitation trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Other neighborhoods will be brought in systematically over the next 2 1/2 
years. The gradual approach will allow the city's fleet of 400 trucks to be 
equipped with automated processing gear, the staff to be trained and markets 
for the reusable material to be developed. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners will use one 16-gallon plastic bin for bottles and cans and a 
90-gallon container suitable for collection of the rest of their household 
waste. Newspapers will be piled on top of the can bin. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is seen as but one partial solution to a looming landfill crisis 
that has concerned homeowners and environmentalists and stymied urban planners. 
Los Angeles is running out of room to dump its garbage, and the dangers to the 
environment posed by existing landfills mount daily. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $160-million cost for the first three years of the program is 
considered by the city's planners as a good long-term investment. The price of 
property suitable for landfill is expected to skyrocket as it grows more 
scarce. By halving the amount of waste bound for landfills, the city can double 
the life of dumps now in use, according to John Stodder, an aide to Mayor 
Bradley on environmental matters. 
</P>
<P>
With the program, Los Angeles will join an estimated 1,000 cities nationwide 
that currently recycle. But the size of Los Angeles' effort will eclipse all 
but possibly New York in scope. 
</P>
<P>
An ongoing pilot program, which has tested the feasibility of the approach at 
95,000 Los Angeles households, already ranks among the largest recycling 
efforts in the nation. If lawn waste is eventually added to the program, the 
city would recycle more material than any in the nation, said Jerry Powell, 
editor of Resource Recycling magazine in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities, including Santa Monica and Pasadena, already have forms of 
curbside recycling. Currently, there is no serious political movement toward 
countywide recycling. 
</P>
<P>
The measure adopted by the council Wednesday, the final council meeting of the 
year, lays out the basic structure of the household recycling program but poses 
many questions. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, it has not yet been determined who will pay the cost of the 
hundreds of thousands of bins and cans -- the homeowner or the city. 
</P>
<P>
Also, while the program will be mandatory, it has not yet been decided how to 
enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
Del Biagi, director of the Bureau of Sanitation, said some of the methods being 
considered include adoption of a unique plan from Rockford, Ill. In that city, 
sanitation workers pick one household weekly for a surprise inspection to 
determine that no recyclable materials have been included in the trash. If the 
homeowner passes the test, he is presented with a check for $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"For $52,000 a year, that might be a pretty good way" to persuade people to 
participate in Los Angeles, Biagi said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, city planners have recommended that scavenging materials from 
curbside for private sale be outlawed. New York officials have taken the 
extreme position of having armed peace officers patrol and issue tickets to 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're ready for that," Biagi told the council members. 
</P>
<P>
Other aspects of the plan still to be worked out are where the Sanitation 
Bureau will establish six transfer stations, where recyclable material will be 
loaded for shipment to processing plants and trash readied for hauling to 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Some environmental activists complained at the council session that the sites 
may be hazardous to surrounding homeowners. They urged council members not to 
approve the program until they know where the sites will be. 
</P>
<P>
The plan approved Wednesday scales back a plan originally proposed by Bradley, 
in that it reduces recycling of lawn waste to a pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also appropriates about $1.6 million in seed money for the 
Sanitation Bureau to hire staff, buy equipment and gear up an education 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we put our money where our mouths are," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is essential," he said of the recycling effort. "Our landfill space is 
running out and (creating) a burden on our ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The recycling program will roll out in phases, beginning in the North-Central 
portion of the city in September. In turn, homeowners in the Harbor area, East 
Valley, West Valley, South-Central and finally West Los Angeles will gradually 
be brought into the program over the next three years. It requires residents of 
houses to separate cans, bottles and newspapers for collection at curbside. The 
City Council still must decide on penalties for scavengers and recycling 
scofflaws. Sanitation officials also must create transfer sites in six city 
areas for initial processing of materials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RECYCLING PLAN AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the recycling plan adopted by the City Council Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
All 720,000 single-family households in the city will be required to put glass 
and plastic bottles, aluminum cans and newspaper into separate containers for 
curbside collection. Participation is mandatory, although penalties have not 
yet been proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners will be provided with one 16-gallon plastic bin for bottles and cans 
and one 90-gallon container for the remainder of their household waste. 
Newspapers are to be piled on top of the bin at curbside. 
</P>
<P>
Scavenging of bottles, cans and paper will be outlawed, with penalties still to 
be determined. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be phased in over three years, beginning in the North-Central 
portion of the city in September, 1990.

LATIN AMERICA: KEY OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED, BUSH DECLARES. WHITE HOUSE OFFERS $1 
MILLION FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO DICTATOR'S CAPTURE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A massive U.S. invasion force on Wednesday overthrew the regime of Panamanian 
strongman Manuel A. Noriega, chasing the dictator into hiding with an air and 
infantry assault that left at least 15 American GIs dead. 
</P>
<P>
The White House offered a $1-million reward for information leading to 
Noriega's capture. 
</P>
<P>
As airlifted troops prepared to storm Panamanian military bases, a justice in 
Panama swore into office the opposition leaders who would have been swept into 
office last May, observers believe, if Noriega had allowed a vote count. 
</P>
<P>
The three -- presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and the two successful 
vice presidential candidates, Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford -- took 
their oaths of office at an American military base. But their whereabouts were 
kept secret throughout the day, an indication of the uncertain military 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Key military objectives have been achieved," President Bush declared in a 
dramatic announcement televised from the Oval Office at dawn, about six hours 
after the operation began. "Most organized resistance has been eliminated. Gen. 
Noriega is in hiding. Yesterday, a dictator ruled Panama, and today, 
constitutionally elected leaders govern." 
</P>
<P>
Bush cited four reasons for the invasion, the first undertaken by his 
Administration: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To protect the lives of the 35,000 Americans in Panama, who Bush said were 
in "imminent danger." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "To defend democracy" there. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To seize Noriega, who is wanted on federal drug-trafficking indictments in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To protect U.S. rights under the Panama Canal Treaties. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he is committed to the terms of the treaties, which call for handing 
the canal over to Panama in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The invasion, christened Operation Just Cause, was launched at midnight in 
Panama after military airlifts nearly doubled the U.S. force in the nation, to 
more than 20,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Americans were wounded in the fighting, and they were airlifted 
to Wilford Hall Air Force Medical Center in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the military casualties, one GI was reported missing and an 
unidentified female civilian dependent living in Panama was said to have been 
killed. Four helicopters were shot down. 
</P>
<P>
The attack left the entire neighborhood around the headquarters of Noriega's 
Panama Defense Forces in flames and the bodies of Noriega loyalists littering 
the streets, according to reports from Panama. 
</P>
<P>
According to a pool report filed by reporters flown to Panama by the Air Force, 
fires continued to rage at the gutted headquarters of the Defense Forces and in 
an adjacent three-block area of the old quarter of Panama City 12 hours after 
the invasion began. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega loyalists engaged the U.S. troops in firefights, which Army Gen. Colin 
L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said were responsible for the 
15 American deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Sporadic fighting was said to have continued into the afternoon Wednesday. Army 
Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, a member of the staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
said the Pentagon hoped to complete "mopping up" operations within three days. 
</P>
<P>
Only one unit -- the Panamanian 1st Infantry -- was putting up organized 
resistance, operating north of Panama City, according to members of Congress 
who were briefed by senior Pentagon and State Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion 2000, one of the Noriega units that harassed opposition figures, no 
longer exists after a brief firefight with U.S. troops, members of Congress 
reported. But they said a Defense Forces radio station continued to operate 
from the 14th story of a building and was believed to be sending out coded 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
However, according to Reuters news service, the station was knocked off the air 
Wednesday night when a U.S. helicopter poured rocket fire into the building. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the day, Noriega broadcast a 52-second radio address from 
an undisclosed location, congratulating his forces and urging Panamanians to 
"resist and advance. Our rallying cry is to overcome or die, not to step 
backwards, and to come forward the victors," he said. He also appealed for 
world help. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in downtown Panama City came under fire and suffered minor 
damage, but no injuries were reported to Americans there. But there were 
conflicting reports about Americans being held hostage by Panamanian troops, 
who temporarily overran the Marriott Hotel near the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said 16 Americans were being held, but U.S. officials said 
late Wednesday that there were no U.S. hostages, although about 60 Americans 
were believed to be "trapped in certain areas" by the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the 82nd Airborne arrived at the Marriott late Wednesday to evacuate 
the 30 or 40 people trapped inside, Associated Press reported. The division's 
arrival was preceded by air cover and light arms fire. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of sources in Washington, meanwhile, reported that from 250 to 800 
Noriega loyalists were being detained as prisoners by the U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Army Ranger paratroopers were dropped out of the night skies from 
C-130s and Apache helicopters flew in a line over the strife-torn country, the 
Bush Administration launched a wide effort to win international support for the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
But it was criticized by Soviet leaders, who were alerted to the invasion when 
the White House dispatched a cable to the Kremlin about the time the operation 
began. It was also overwhelmingly condemned by Latin American governments, 
which refused to recognize the leadership installed 40 minutes before the 
overthrow got under way. But some West European governments, including Britain, 
offered verbal support. 
</P>
<P>
As described by Powell, the invasion had three prongs, with operations in the 
central Panama Canal Zone, near the international airport and to the west near 
Rio Hato. 
</P>
<P>
The forces' immediate military objectives -- apparently achieved -- were to 
gain control of key Panamanian military bases, a prison holding about 50 
Defense Forces dissidents who took part in an unsuccessful coup against Noriega 
on Oct. 3, an electrical power plant and the Bridge of the Americas crossing 
the Panama Canal. Among the prisoners who were freed, a Pentagon source said, 
was an American CIA agent held in Panama since April. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the agent's last name was Muse and that his first name was Carlton 
or something similar. 
</P>
<P>
But Noriega eluded the 13,000 U.S. troops deployed in Panama, the 7,500 troops 
airlifted in Monday and Tuesday and reinforcements sent in Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Elite commandos were dispatched throughout the countryside to find him, and 
weapons caches he had established throughout Panama were said to be under 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
"We have every spigot turned on to find Mr. Noriega. We're turning on all our 
looking, listening and hearing devices," Lt. Gen. Kelly said. "We have a 
concern that he's gone off into the jungle." 
</P>
<P>
Officials expressed little surprise that Noriega appeared to have advance word 
of the assault. 
</P>
<P>
"When you watch a lot of C-141s roll in, it's a dead giveaway. And 
unfortunately, it just took a lot of C-141s for the U.S. to get down there," 
one Pentagon official said. Indeed, the giant jet cargo planes began stepped-up 
flights to Howard Air Force Base in Panama on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But Powell expressed doubts about Noriega's ability to avoid the dragnet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been some years since (Noriega), the fugitive, has been seen in the 
jungle, living in the jungle. He's used to a different kind of life style, and 
I'm not quite sure he would be up to being chased around the countryside by 
Army Rangers, Special Forces and light infantry units of the Joint Operations 
Training Center," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
But, acting on the assumption that they might not be able to find Noriega 
immediately, U.S. troops and intelligence forces moved quickly to disable 
Panamanian ships, shut down all airstrips and set up roadblocks, U.S. officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two years, Noriega has been a festering wound in the side of 
American foreign policy, successfully fending off economic and diplomatic 
pressure. He held onto power that he enforced through the ruthless activities 
of the so-called Dignity Battalions and the Panama Defense Forces, of which he 
was commander. Stiff economic sanctions intended to cut off most U.S. business 
with Panama were imposed by the Reagan Administration, but they failed to 
weaken Noriega's grip. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, Endara, Ford and their supporters came under bloody attack from 
Noriega supporters when they tried to claim the offices that independent 
election observers agreed they had won. Bush at that time called for the 
Defense Forces to overthrow Noriega. But the President came under sharp 
criticism in early October when he made only limited U.S. support available for 
what turned out to be an unsuccessful coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis came to a head last weekend when an unarmed U.S. Marine officer in 
civilian clothes was shot and killed in a confrontation with Panamanian troops 
in front of their headquarters; a Navy lieutenant was seized temporarily and 
his wife threatened with sexual abuse, and other Americans were harassed. In 
addition, Noriega's rubber-stamp legislature declared Friday that a state of 
war existed with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called his senior advisers, including Vice President Dan Quayle, Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and National 
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, to a secret meeting at the White House on 
Sunday to review military options and begin the final updating of a Pentagon 
plan initially drawn up before the Administration took office Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Wednesday that Bush felt he faced greater danger from inaction than 
from using the military to overthrow Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key factors prompting Bush to act was intelligence that Noriega had 
a 250-member paramilitary unit standing by to attack what Sen. John Warner of 
Virginia, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
described as "a designated segment of Americans in their housing units." In the 
President's mind, this threat eclipsed the knowledge that U.S. intelligence was 
not certain about Noriega's location, congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush spent most of Tuesday night and the pre-dawn hours of Wednesday in the 
Oval Office and his adjacent study. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed casually in a dark blue sweater and slacks, the President received 
reports of the troop movements and initial fighting from Scowcroft, while he, 
Quayle and Baker contacted foreign leaders in an effort to gain support for the 
mission. A television set carried live reports. 
</P>
<P>
Bush napped briefly in the early morning and then addressed the nation by 
television from the Oval Office as the day broke. 
</P>
<P>
"I took this action only after reaching the conclusion that every other avenue 
was closed and the lives of American citizens were in grave danger," Bush said.

'ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,' PRESIDENT DECLARED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
George Bush, accompanied by only a tiny handful of senior advisers, broke away 
from a small pre-Christmas brunch at the White House on Sunday to make the 
loneliest decision of his presidency: to order a massive military assault on 
the regime of Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush and his aides huddled, U.S. intelligence showed that the likelihood of 
capturing Noriega himself was chancy at best and that the loss of American and 
Panamanian lives was almost certain. But senior aides said the President did 
not hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"Enough is enough," Bush declared. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, which aides said was highly personal, reflected Bush's 
determination not to allow the Noriega regime -- tainted by charges of drug 
dealing and increasingly violent acts against Americans -- to remain in power, 
regardless of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset of the highly secret 30-minute meeting, Bush made it clear that 
what he wanted was not a "surgical strike" against Noriega personally but a 
full-scale attack on the entire Noriega regime and the Panama Defense Forces, 
which had kept him in power despite two years of U.S. pressure and plotting. 
</P>
<P>
"The President was saying, 'We don't want to do it piecemeal,' " one official 
said. "He didn't have thefull battle plan, but he knew its code name, and he 
was ready to go with it, accepting casualties" and nothing less than the full 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Among the small group attending Sunday's meeting were Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Colin L. Powell and Vice 
President Dan Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting came just at the end of a holiday brunch that Bush and his wife, 
Barbara, had hosted for a group of Administration officials and their wives, 
including Quayle and Baker. 
</P>
<P>
A Defense Department official said that Bush "had to make a fundamental 
decision: Did we want to have enough people needed for such an operation in 
place and risk Noriega finding out? Or did we want to risk an operation that 
failed because of insufficient troops and equipment? That, too, might have 
failed to get Noriega." 
</P>
<P>
There was never any question about which option the President wanted, aides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had made up our mind that if there was going to be a military solution, it 
had to be one that would succeed -- and we developed one that would," said a 
senior official. 
</P>
<P>
One factor in Bush's decision to opt for maximum force instead of a surgical 
strike, according to members of Congress who were briefed on the military 
operation by Administration officials, was intelligence reports that Noriega 
had a 250-member paramilitary unit poised to attack what Sen. John Warner 
(R-Va.) described as "a designated segment of Americans in their housing 
units." 
</P>
<P>
Such intelligence reports were unconfirmed but had to be taken seriously, Baker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, capturing Noriega would have been difficult under the best of 
circumstances, a U.S. intelligence official said, because "he has been jumping 
around like a Mexican jumping bean. We were aware of several places where he 
was yesterday (Tuesday) and made considerable effort to find him. But there 
never was any absolute certainty he would be in any particular place." 
</P>
<P>
Bush was described by one top official as "deeply disturbed" by recent events 
in Panama, including the killing of a U.S. Marine officer and the abuse of a 
U.S. naval officer and his wife last weekend and Noriega's increasingly 
bellicose statements, including his declaration of "a state of war" with the 
United States last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The scuttlebutt I hear is that the sexual abuse of the Navy officer's wife 
sent Bush up the wall," former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Panama Defense Forces soldiers had fired on a car carrying 
four U.S. military officers, killing one and wounding another. After the 
shooting, PDF soldiers also repeatedly beat and kicked a Navy officer and 
abused his wife. The Defense Department reported that she was sexually 
threatened, slammed against a wall with such force that her head was cut and 
was made to stand at the wall with her arms above her head until she collapsed 
onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Although concern was expressed within the Administration about the possible 
loss of life and the potential for Americans to be taken hostage, once Bush 
made his decision, officials moved quickly to execute a detailed contingency 
plan that had been developed weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The official code name for the operation still has not been disclosed, but 
Administration officials have informally dubbed it Operation Just Cause. 
</P>
<P>
Although the basic plan already existed when Cheney took over as defense 
secretary earlier this year, it was extensively refined after the failure of a 
coup attempt by some PDF rebels last October. 
</P>
<P>
Weeks ago, members of the Senate and House Armed Services committees were told 
that a new invasion plan had been adopted and that the Administration was 
simply waiting for an opportunity to put it into effect. In fact, some key 
members of Congress were surprised last Friday when the Administration failed 
to move after the Panamanian legislature declared the country to be in a state 
of war with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's decision, a tightly guarded secret in Washington, was kept from 
Republican congressional leaders until about 10 p.m. Tuesday -- about three 
hours before the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said that he had surmised a military 
operation might be in the works two days ago, when Bush told him "things were 
getting pretty bad down there and that something might have to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Even some senior officials involved in the operation did not learn of the 
decision until Monday morning, when they were told but instructed to keep the 
matter in utmost secrecy. John H. Sununu, White House chief of staff, learned 
of the decision at his regular meeting at 8:15 a.m. Monday with Bush, Quayle 
and Scowcroft. 
</P>
<P>
That meeting usually lasts only 30 minutes. On Monday, it lasted about 1 hour 
and 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
It was Monday morning that Bush and his aides fleshed out decisions on the 
details of implementing the contingency plan -- when and where the invasion 
would take place. 
</P>
<P>
Outwardly, Bush and other officials who knew of the plan took pains to go about 
most of their business as usual so that an atmosphere of crisis would not be 
created. 
</P>
<P>
The President called a meeting for 2 p.m. Tuesday, which he billed as a session 
to discuss "the use of the military in the war on drugs," said one source, and 
it was at that meeting that several senior officials learned for the first time 
that the military assault would be launched. 
</P>
<P>
Among those attending Tuesday's meeting were Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, Deputy 
National Security Adviser Robert M. Gates and Richard Darman, director of the 
Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody realized it was extremely important that the decision be closely 
held," said an official, who added that Quayle did not tell his own chief of 
staff, Bill Crystal, until 8:30 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his wife hosted a Christmas party at the White House for staff members 
Tuesday night, and the President stayed until 9 p.m., about four hours before 
the assault began. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Cheney attended a round of holiday parties and social events 
Tuesday night and did not return to the Pentagon until about 10 p.m. Just 
before midnight, Cheney joined Gen. Powell in the Pentagon's Current Situation 
Room, a windowless chamber filled with electronics communications and 
computer-generated maps that is used for monitoring military crises. 
</P>
<P>
There, the two remained in contact with the operation through the night, using 
an open line to Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the Southern Command's senior officer, 
and his operational planning staff. 
</P>
<P>
One senior officer said Powell helped shape some operational decisions by 
asking pointed questions of military commanders on the scene but that he left 
the Pentagon's original plan largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
"He let Gen. Thurman run the operation," said the officer. "It was a very 
controlled, deliberate, calm atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
About 10 p.m. Tuesday, Bush and Quayle began telephoning congressional leaders 
and informing them of the impending attack. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) told the President he would support the 
operation, but he expressed some "concerns." Foley later emphasized that he was 
"informed" and not "consulted" on the invasion plan. 
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) assured the President that 
there would be no criticism from Congress. "There have been any number of your 
critics out there advocating just this step," Michel told Bush. "So I don't 
think you are going to have any criticism, at least not as far as Congress is 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
About 11 p.m., Bush and Quayle began telephoning leaders of other countries. 
The President reportedly called Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle telephoned Latin American leaders he has met on recent overseas trips, 
according to an official, who said that one Latin American head of state, whom 
he declined to identify, told the vice president that Noriega "was asking for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
A Quayle aide said that while the vice president found most of the leaders he 
telephoned "gratifyingly supportive," several Latin American leaders suggested 
that both sides were to blame for problems in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that the Administration also had sent a detailed cable Monday to 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, Japan and other allied countries, 
outlining the "facts" of the U.S. case against Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The cable cited Noriega's declaration of a state of war with the United States, 
the killing of the Marine and the abuse of the naval officer and his wife, 
Baker said, and characterized those actions as "unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Although the cable did not suggest that there would be a U.S. invasion, it did 
outline the rationale that has been used by the Administration to justify the 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
Meetings of Administration officials, including a special "deputies' committee" 
established to handle international crises, continued into Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
That committee, made up of officials directly below the principals, is headed 
by Gates, the deputy national security adviser, and includes Undersecretary of 
State Robert M. Kimmitt, Undersecretary of Defense Paul G. Wolfowitz and Asst. 
Atty. Gen. William P. Barr. 
</P>
<P>
After the 2 p.m. Tuesday meeting at the White House, where the rationale for 
the Panama action was spelled out in detail, lawyers reviewed the statements 
and prepared additional documents in support of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Because Noriega has used military force to remain in power and is not 
considered popular among Panamanians, some senior officials suggested that by 
neutralizing the Panama Defense Forces, the United States was putting pressure 
on Noriega to flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether he's going to dig down in a hole or try to get out of 
there," one official involved in planning the operation said. "He's been 
through a couple of coup attempts, and the Panama Defense Forces consider him a 
liability. The danger to him can come from a number of places besides the 
United States, so he has a lot of incentives to get away and stay away."

PANAMA AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Area: 29,208 square miles with 2.2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Government: The military, always a powerful force, has dominated political life 
since an October, 1968, coup. Gen. Omar Torrijos, a populist, ruled the country 
almost single-handedly until his death in 1981. His intelligence chief, Gen. 
Manuel A. Noriega, won a power struggle and became commander in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Economy: With a foreign debt of about $4 billion, Panama is one of the most 
heavily indebted nations per capita in the world. The United States severed 
economic and military aid to Panama in July, 1987.

SHIFT TO CIVILIAN RULE MAY MEAN WIDER U.S. ROLE

Now that U.S. forces have scored a quick military victory in Panama, what do 
they do next? 
</P>
<P>
The danger facing American troops over the next few weeks and months, military 
analysts said Wednesday, is that the new civilian government headed by 
President Guillermo Endara may not be strong enough to rule on its own. That 
could push the United States, whose pre-invasion force of about 13,000 troops 
in Panama is responsible solely for protecting the canal, into the unwanted 
role of a long-term army of occupation. 
</P>
<P>
"The future risks are tremendous," said John Roberts, a Panama expert who 
served as general counsel on the Senate Armed Services Committee when the 
Panama Canal treaties were ratified in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst possible scenario would be for the civilian government to remain in 
a weak and powerless state, forcing us to maintain a military occupation in the 
city," said Roberts, who is now dean of the law school at DePaul University in 
Chicago. "That would be a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Short of that, experts held out a number of other uncomfortable outcomes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- That U.S. forces would have to stay behind to overhaul the Panama Defense 
Forces, which have maintained strongman Manuel A. Noriega in power. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That Panama would need U.S. military police to take over municipal police 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That even a modest long-term U.S. presence would turn Latin American 
opinion against the Endara government. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. officials refused to be pinned down on how long occupying troops 
will be needed in Panama, they talked in terms of sooner rather than later. 
Army Lt. Gen. Thomas Kelly told reporters that the mopping-up operation is 
likely to be completed within three days. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers echoed that message. "There have been some fears expressed that we 
might have an occupation force in Panama," said Senate Republican Leader Bob 
Dole of Kansas. "I don't foresee that." 
</P>
<P>
Dole's views were seconded by Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, top-ranking 
Republican on the Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, were less optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"The PDF as an institution is rotten to the core," argued Alan Sabrosky, 
professor of international studies at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tenn., and a 
former Army veteran who taught for more than five years at the Army War 
College. "For the government to survive, we may have to rebuild (the military) 
from the ground up." 
</P>
<P>
House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) warned that U.S. 
military police units may be forced to stay in Panama for at least a year to 
help keep the peace. He noted that the last MPs did not leave Grenada until 18 
months after the invasion there in October, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Despite fears the continuing presence of Americans could undermine Panamanian 
support for the new government, they "are going to need a police force," Aspin 
said. "The whole public safety forces of the country are being decimated. . . . 
Who's going to arrest and interrogate the PDF?" 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Record, a military analyst at the Hudson Institute here and a former 
aide to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), said it is 
likely to take months to rebuild the PDF into a military institution capable of 
supporting rather than threatening the new civilian government. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to have to have a fairly visible presence there for quite a while 
to put the authoritarian opponents on notice that we mean business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said Endara faces an uphill struggle in establishing the 
legitimacy of his new government. On the positive side, he is seen as the 
winner of the May elections, whose results Noriega refused to accept. But he 
carries the burden of having been sworn in just as the U.S. military operations 
began, and he remained in hiding Wednesday under the protection of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a good sign that the new government doesn't have enough confidence to 
emerge from protective custody," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the widespread public support in Panama for the invasion, there is also 
the risk that Americans may become targets of attack by Noriega supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts said that it would be far easier to overcome any remaining 
resistance if Noriega is found. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they believe that Noriega is no longer a threat. He "may 
take to the hills and be very hard to find," said John Bushnell, U.S. charge 
d'affaires at Ft. Clayton outside Panama City. "But he wouldn't have a 
significant force to actually do anything."

COLD FEET IN THE DELIVERY ROOM

At 22 degrees Fahrenheit, the delivery room at Sea World may be colder than 
most, but no less productive. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, more feathered couples than ever are becoming parents at the marine 
park's "Penguin Encounter" and their 45 hatchlings are attracting attention. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, the glassed-in, 5,000-square-foot cold climate exhibit has begun to 
resemble a hospital infant ward, as park visitors strain to get a glimpse of 
the 14 fast-growing Adelie penguins that are just beginning to venture outside 
their nests. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the most exciting additions to the park's penguin colony are not 
yet on public display. In addition to 23 other Adelie babies, two Gentoo 
penguins are being hand-raised by park keepers -- the first Gentoos to be born 
from eggs laid in captivity at Sea World. Six baby Humboldt penguins are being 
hand-raised as well. Keepers say that by observing the young, they hope to 
learn more about preserving Humboldts, the one penguin species that is 
endangered. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was an oil spill off the coast of Chile or Peru where the Humboldts 
are, that could disrupt the whole species," said Joop Kuhn, supervisor of 
aviculture at Sea World. "We'd need to know what to feed them, how often, how 
much. But we're getting a pretty good understanding -- we'd know where to 
start." 
</P>
<P>
With more than 500 penguins, the park's 6-year-old exhibit is the largest 
penguin colony outside of the Antarctic. As part of a project conducted with 
the National Science Foundation, the park keeps detailed records on each 
penguin from nine different species. 
</P>
<P>
There's a file, for example, on King Tut, the first King penguin park keepers 
hand-raised from an egg that was laid in the wild. There's another on Elvis, a 
King penguin named for the "king of rock and roll," Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Files include personal details, he said: "Who they're paired up with, how many 
offspring they've had, if they've changed mates -- for the most part they're 
monogamous, but we've seen a slight divorce rate in our enclosure." 
</P>
<P>
Park experts know which birds have shown a knack for keeping their eggs warm, 
and which have wandered off to let the eggs fend for themselves. They know when 
a penguin lays two eggs, as they often do as a kind of "insurance," Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most penguin species will lay two eggs but rarely will they be able to raise 
both young. It's survival of the fittest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But park keepers, eager to supplement their growing colony, have begun rescuing 
the second eggs from the nests before they hatch. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother Nature is very tough on her own. We try to sort of soften that by 
artificial incubating," Kuhn said. "If we take one egg from our birds, and 
leave them with one, they will put all their effort and energy there." 
</P>
<P>
The hand-raised babies are treated to what keepers call penguin milkshakes, a 
tasty mixture of herring filets, shrimp-like crustaceans, half-and-half cream, 
water and vitamins that is heated to 90 degrees to resemble the regurgitated 
meals their parents would feed them in the wild, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn said the park had also hoped to hatch some Chinstrap penguins this year, 
which have never been hatched in captivity. Chinstrap penguins, named for the 
black stripe across their necks, laid eggs for the first time at Sea World this 
year. But the eggs proved infertile. 
</P>
<P>
"They do their best sitting on the eggs. Hopefully by the second year . . . 
they can pull it off," Kuhn said.

INVESTIGATORS TRYING TO LEARN WHY TRUCK WAS ON TRACKS

Federal investigators began to probe the charred and twisted wreckage Wednesday 
in their effort determine why a truck drove onto the tracks in front of a 
high-speed passenger train in a crash that killed three and injured at least 
55. 
</P>
<P>
Most officials agreed that heavy fog was a factor in Tuesday' accident, but 
reports still conflicted as to whether the grade-crossing signals and gates 
were working properly in the seconds before impact. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe railroad cleared a path through the wreckage about 6:30 a.m. 
Wednesday, and the first freight train moved through about an hour and a half 
later. Amtrak passenger service was still being detoured around the crash site 
Wednesday, using nearby Southern Pacific railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that although 24 of the injured had initially been listed in 
serious or critical condition, only nine remained hospitalized Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The San Joaquin County coroner's office Wednesday identified the locomotive 
engineer killed in the crash as Edward McMillan, 48, of Hayward and the fireman 
who died beside him as Michael G. Passarella, 41, of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office earlier had identified the third man who died as David 
Haskell, 47, of Anaheim, the driver of the truck laden with chocolate syrup 
that was hit broadside by the train. 
</P>
<P>
State Department of Motor Vehicle records show that Haskell had been cited for 
speeding three times in the last two years, but the California Highway Patrol 
said there was no indication that the truck was exceeding the speed limit as it 
approached the grade crossing where the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
National Transportation Safety Board investigators said late Wednesday that a 
"black box" recorder designed to compile data on the train's speed and control 
settings apparently was destroyed in the fire that swept through the locomotive 
after impact. The fire, fed by diesel oil from the locomotive's fuel tanks, 
burned for about 90 minutes before firefighters extinguished it. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators said they are attempting to determine whether an 
advance-warning device recovered from the locomotive had sounded an alarm in 
the seconds before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the device should have alerted the engineer if the flashing 
lights, alarm bells and crossing gates were not functioning as they should have 
as Amtrak Train No. 708 -- the San Joaquin Flyer -- approached the rural grade 
crossing at 70 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak spokesman Arthur Lloyd said Wednesday that preliminary inspections 
suggest that the lights, bells and gates at Mariposa Road were operating 
properly. He said the splintered gate arm found after the wreck indicates that 
the truck sheared off the already lowered barrier as the big rig rolled into 
the path of the train. 
</P>
<P>
"Evidently, the vehicle ignored the lights and went right in front of the 
train," Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line to crossing accidents is that in 99% of them, ultimately you 
find that the driver did not heed or obey warning signals," said Michael A. 
Martin, a Santa Fe railroad spokesman from Los Angeles. "We see situations 
where people abandon all common sense to save 30 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
However, Stockton trucker Leon Gritz, who said he was driving directly behind 
the truck that was hit, told California Highway Patrol investigators he did not 
see the flashing lights. He also said the crossing gates were not lowered as 
they should have been. 
</P>
<P>
Grits, who said he drives the route frequently, told reporters that the gates 
often lower too slowly to seal off the grade crossing before high-speed trains 
arrive there. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said that under current regulations, trains are permitted to 
pass through the crossing at up to 79 m.p.h., regardless of the weather or 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said Wednesday that while the fog, which had cut visibility to an 
estimated 100 yards or less at the time of the accident, was not a factor in 
the operation of the train, "it could have been a very significant factor as 
far as the truck was concerned."

MEDICARE MORTALITY RATES: 72 FACILITIES TOP PREDICTIONS

More than 70 California hospitals had significantly higher than predicted death 
rates for Medicare patients between 1986 and 1988, and 28 institutions in the 
state had significantly lower than predicted death rates, according to an 
analysis of the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration's third annual report 
on Medicare mortality at the nation's hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 72 California hospitals with higher than predicted rates were 
California Medical Center and Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Los 
Angeles, Valley Hospital Medical Center in Van Nuys, Humana Hospital in 
Westminster and two Kaiser Foundation hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Facilities with lower than predicted mortality rates included City of Hope 
National Medical Center in Duarte, Green Hospital of Scripps Clinic in La 
Jolla, seven Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and UCLA 
Medical Center in Los Angeles and UC San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
HCFA's report was made public Wednesday. The analysis of the report was 
prepared by Michael Pine &amp; Associates Inc., a Chicago health care 
consulting firm that was a consultant to HCFA on the preparation of its report. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Pine, the president of the firm, made available to The Times a list 
of the California hospitals with the highest and lowest overall mortality rates 
for Medicare patients for the three-year period, as compared to their predicted 
death rates. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics reflect the percentage of a hospital's Medicare patients who 
died within 30 days of being admitted to the hospital, whether as hospital 
patients or after discharge, as compared to its predicted percentage. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital's predicted mortality rate takes into account characteristics of its 
patients that predict their relative risk of dying, such as age, sex, chronic 
diseases and previous hospitalizations. 
</P>
<P>
The mortality information "is not a direct measure of the quality of care, but 
it is a valuable tool to identify potential problems for review and action by 
hospital administrators and medical staff," said Louis B. Hays, HCFA's acting 
administrator. Hays said consumers should "consult their physicians when 
evaluating the report on a particular hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals should "begin to incorporate not only this data but also statistical 
techniques in day-to-day quality improvement activities," Pine said. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics allow a hospital's actual performance to be compared with its 
expected performance but they are not intended to be used to make comparisons 
between institutions. In addition to overall death rates, the HCFA report 
includes data on common causes of death in the elderly, such as heart disease 
and strokes. 
</P>
<P>
HCFA also released the results of studies which it said demonstrated the value 
of the report as an indicator of the quality of medical care. 
</P>
<P>
For example, HCFA said that hospitals with high mortality rates are more likely 
to have quality problems identified after detailed case-by case reviews than 
the average hospital. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, hospitals with low mortality rates are more likely to have 
favorable characteristics, according to a report by Medical College of 
Wisconsin and HCFA researchers published in today's New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the average hospital, these favorable characteristics include a 
higher percentage of physicians who are board certified specialists, a higher 
percentage of registered nurses, higher occupancy rates, and better 
availability of high-technology equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But the researchers cautioned that these findings, which are based on "patterns 
of performance in a large number of hospitals," do not imply that a detailed 
review of a specific hospital with a high mortality rate will find quality 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
As in previous years, hospital associations downplayed the significance of 
HCFA's data, while consumer groups applauded its release. 
</P>
<P>
"The mortality data only tells you a very little bit about the quality of care 
that is delivered," said Carol McCarthy, president of the Chicago-based 
American Hospital Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Health Research Group in Washington, 
said the federal government was "clearly moving in the right direction" but 
should continue to improve the annual reports by including data on individual 
surgeries and medical illnesses, as well as on individual physicians. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-volume report is based on a computerized analysis of about 10.5 million 
Medicare admissions at nearly 6,000 acute-care hospitals during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 report is similar to the two previous reports, although HCFA said the 
statistical methods have been "refined and improved." For example, the 
percentage of emergency cases and transfers from nursing homes are taken into 
account. Such patients are at greater risk of dying than the average Medicare 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
Mortality data for 1986 and 1987 have been reanalyzed with the improved 
techniques. These results are included in the new report, as well as summary 
statistical information on each hospital's services and staffing. Mortality is 
listed for "all causes" as well as for 16 individual "diagnostic categories." 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals were given a chance to review their statistics in advance and provide 
explanations, which were published as part of the report. About 1,360 
hospitals, or 24% of the total, prepared such comments, compared to 51% of the 
hospitals when the report was released in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In general, hospitals with higher than expected mortality rates defended the 
quality of their care. The most common explanations included the high-risk 
nature of their cases or discrepancies in their data. 
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals initially felt threatened by the publication and commented in 
response to that apprehension," HCFA officials said in a written statement made 
available to reporters. "Hospitals now realize that the publication is perhaps 
of greater use to them than they originally believed. Rather than taking the 
time to object, hospitals have studied the results." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Morford, executive director of HCFA's Health Standards and Quality 
Bureau, which prepared the report, said that hospitals with consistently high 
Medicare mortality rates would be scrutinized by federal survey teams and 
Medicare watchdog organizations such as California Medical Review. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't take punitive action because (a hospital has a high mortality rate,)" 
Morford said. "When presented with this information, I say let's look further." 
</P>
<P>
Such a survey of King Hospital in Los Angeles, based on its high 1987 mortality 
rates, discovered scores of patient care deficiencies and led to a threatened 
cut-off of federal funds. On Monday, the federal government, citing a "dramatic 
turnaround" at King, said Medicare and Medi-Cal funds would be continued. 
</P>
<P>
The report, "Medicare Hospital Mortality Information, 1986-1988" can be ordered 
from the Health Care Financing Administration, Health Standards and Quality 
Bureau, 2-D-2 Meadows East Building, 6325 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21207, 
or by calling (301) 966-1133.

researcher Tracy Thomas in Los Angeles assisted in preparing this story.

<P>
MEDICARE DEATH RATES 
</P>
<P>
These California hospitals had the highest and lowest mortality rates for 
Medicare patients as compared to their predicted death rates between 1986 and 
1988, according to an analysis of U.S. Health Care Financing Administration 
data by Michael Pine &amp; Associates Inc., a Chicago health care consulting 
firm. The HCFA data was compiled earlier this year and made public Wednesday. 
Pine &amp; Associates was a consultant to HCFA on the preparation of the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The data reflects the percentage of a hospital's Medicare patients who died 
within 30 days of being admitted, whether as patients or after discharge. The 
national average 30-day mortality rate is about 12%. 
</P>
<P>
This list of high and low mortality rate hospitals, which was prepared by Pine 
&amp; Associates, differs in some instances from the report released by HCFA, 
although it is based on the same data. This is because different statistical 
techniques were used and data for the three years was combined. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals listed in boldface type had statistically significant high or low 
mortality rates for 1988, as well as for the entire three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
An asterisk indicates hospitals that sent explanatory comments about their data 
to HCFA.

NOTES: "Patient risk" is a measure of the relative risk of dying for a 
hospital's patients as compared to the national average risk. A value of "1" is 
average. A value over "1" is above average. A value under "1" is below average. 
</P>
<P>
The "% Higher" or "% Lower" than expected statistic is a comparison of the 
hospital's actual and predicted mortality rates. The predicted mortality rate 
takes into account characteristics of individual patients. These include age, 
sex, principal diagnosis, other chronic illnesses, previous hospitalizations, 
emergency or non-emergency admission status, admission source, such as a 
nursing home or hospital transfer, as well as the number of patients treated at 
each hospital. If a patient was hospitalized multiple times, only the last 
admission for each year was included. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California hospitals with more than 1,000 cases over the three-year 
period are listed, as well as hospitals from other parts of the state with more 
than 3,000 cases. There is a less than a one-in-1,000 probability that a 
hospital would be listed as having a high or low mortality rate because of 
chance alone, according to the study's authors.

<P>
GOVERNMENT: OFFICIALS MISTAKENLY TOLD DISTRIBUTORS NOT TO COLLECT LEVIES ON 
SALES TO MILITARY BASES. NOW THE STATE HAS TO TRY TO RECOUP $7 MILLION THAT 
WASN'T COLLECTED.

<P>
At a time when the state feels compelled to raise taxes on motorists and 
shoppers, it has neglected to collect millions of dollars in taxes from liquor 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
In what officials now acknowledge was a "foul-up," the State Board of 
Equalization has ignored about $7 million in taxes that it should have started 
collecting in 1984 when tax exemptions on liquor sold at military bases 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the agency continued to advise liquor distributors in official tax 
guides and on printed tax forms that sales at military bases were exempt from 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that we are not sloppy but in this case we made a mistake. It 
was an error on our part," the board's executive director, Cindy Rambo, told 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that both the industry and members of the Board of Equalization 
concede will spark a legal battle, the agency began this week to assess 
individual distributors for back taxes plus interest on any wine and hard 
liquor sold in the last three years to military bases. 
</P>
<P>
Jim McDermott, president of the Wine &amp; Spirits Wholesalers of California, 
said he is certain the industry will appeal the assessments. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe they would come along now and want to collect retroactively 
the taxes that are involved when they told us we were exempt," he said. "I feel 
there must be some misunderstanding. Why would they sit and wait all this time 
to apply a tax they say they should have applied in 1984?" 
</P>
<P>
Even members of the Board of Equalization conceded the industry will have good 
cause to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to have them come up with a good case," said board member Ernest 
J. Dronenburg, referring to the liquor industry. "I'm sympathetic to them on a 
fairness ground." 
</P>
<P>
Rambo, who became the board's executive director in February, 1988, said 
apparently the agency's staff failed to notice a provision in California law 
stating that the military exemption from alcoholic beverage taxes was "to 
remain in effect only until Jan. 1, 1984." She said the mistake was first 
discovered in 1987 but memorandums outlining the problem were never circulated 
beyond the lower level staff that had uncovered it. She said it was not brought 
to her attention until six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my point of view that when you have a problem like this the best thing 
you can do is own up to the fact that you made a mistake and do the best you 
can to rectify it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, she said the five-member board that governs the agency was advised 
by its lawyers that state law required that it attempt to recover the revenue. 
She said a statute of limitations prevented the board from seeking back taxes 
beyond three years. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a shock when we heard about it," said board member Conway Collis. 
"I think the Board of Equalization staff has improved dramatically in the last 
six years and they are now as good as any agency in state government, but this 
is clearly a significant and embarrassing foul-up." 
</P>
<P>
He said legally the board "cannot give away the state's money so we had no 
choice but to try to collect this tax." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee Chairman John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove) 
theorized that the distributors probably will be successful in challenging the 
assessment because the state had advised them in writing that they did not need 
to pay the tax. 
</P>
<P>
"I am amazed this happened," he said. "The board usually seems on top of these 
kind of issues. Maybe they were surprised that we let a tax exemption expire. 
We so rarely do that, perhaps it never occurred to them that we might." 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi was a major sponsor this year of a proposal to increase the state's 
gasoline tax by 9 cents per gallon to raise revenue for a 10-year, 
$18.5-billion transportation improvement program. The tax goes to the voters in 
June. A temporary one-quarter-cent increase in the state sales tax went into 
effect Dec. 1 to pay for earthquake repairs and relief. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Equalization, which is composed of elected members, administers 
most state business taxes including the alcoholic beverage tax totaling about 
$128 million each fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The liquor distributors can appeal the assessment for back taxes to the board. 
If the board rules against them, they can appeal to the courts.

THATCHER ALONE IN ALL-OUT SUPPORT FOR ATTACK

The only major nation to give wholehearted public support Wednesday to the U.S. 
military incursion into Panama was Britain, whose longstanding "special 
relationship" with Washington has come under question this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone has to uphold democracy," Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared to 
journalists after an early-morning phone call from President Bush advising her 
of the operation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a courageous decision," Thatcher said. "The more leaders of government 
who believe passionately in democracy and make clear they support the United 
States, the more swiftly that action will be brought to a conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
America's other principal European allies either avoided public comment or 
issued equivocal statements, while elsewhere, criticism ranged from mild to 
furious. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to the American Western Nazis and their allies, Nero and Hitler were 
angels," Libyan strongman Moammar Kadafi said in a statement published by the 
official Libyan news agency and relayed by Agence France- Presse in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of such barbarism," Kadafi added, "I can only invite all of the 
people of the small countries of the world to immediately unite and prepare 
themselves to resist." 
</P>
<P>
France was waiting for "the maximum amount of information" before reacting to 
the news, a Foreign Ministry official in Paris said. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, an official statement from the West German government said authorities 
there "hope that the military clash will soon be over and human lives saved, 
and that the way becomes free for the democratic freedom of the country as 
demanded by the European Community." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama also said he hopes the confrontation 
would end soon. And in Canada, External Affairs Minister Joe Clark tempered his 
sympathy over American motives with regret because "intervention by force is a 
dangerous precedent." 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia, which is a major force in the nonaligned movement, also described 
the U.S. action as "unacceptable" and "a crude violation of sovereignty," 
according to a Foreign Ministry statement from Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
Francois Heisbourg, director of London's International Institute for Strategic 
Studies, predicted that ultimately U.S. allies' "reactions will be a function 
of (the) success or failure" of the Panama action. "The problem with these 
operations is that they have to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek said in a radio interview that he 
sympathizes with the U.S. decision because of the danger to American troops in 
the former Canal Zone. But his Spanish counterpart, Francisco Fernandez 
Ordonez, said he "deeply lamented" the U.S. action. He said that Spain, "which 
always has been opposed to foreign military intervention, expresses its hope 
that the Panamanian people can decide their future in freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union deplored the 
U.S. invasion as "aggression." But U.S. diplomats in Moscow asserted that the 
Soviets' private reaction was milder and contained expressions of hope that 
U.S.-Soviet relations will suffer no lasting setback. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a bit surprised by the tone and degree of their public criticism," one 
American conceded. "It was more aggressive than we might have expected. But 
based on our private conversations, we see no long-term, substantive problems 
between Washington and Moscow because of this." 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet source in Moscow appeared to agree with this suggestion. "It is, 
without a doubt, an irritant in the public arena," he said of the Panama 
incursion, "but it will not affect the course of Soviet-American relations." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said President Bush informed Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the military move just as it was beginning. 
Baker suggested that initial Soviet criticism came before the Kremlin had 
received the Bush message. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain, opposition parties lashed out at the Thatcher government's 
endorsement during a brief but heated exchange after a statement by Foreign 
Minister Douglas Hurd in the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"However (Hurd) dresses it up, the American invasion of Panama City is an act 
of naked aggression against the sovereignty of that country," said Tony Banks, 
a leader of the rival Labor Party. "When will the government stop acting as 
apologist for every act of aggression perpetrated by the United States?"

MAJORITY OF LAWMAKERS HAIL BUSH'S MOVE

<P>
A clear majority in the Democratic-controlled Congress, which has often urged 
President Bush to get tough on Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega, on 
Wednesday applauded the incursion into Panama and urged the Administration to 
bring the deposed leader to justice. 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction is: Finally! At last!" said House Armed Services Committee 
Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.), reflecting the frustration that many members of 
Congress have felt in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"The White House has done too little for too long," declared Sen. Alan Cranston 
(D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
"I support the President's decision," said Senate Majority Leader George 
Mitchell (D-Me.), who has been among Bush's harshest critics on other foreign 
policy matters. "It was made necessary by the reckless actions of Gen. 
Noriega." 
</P>
<P>
Like Aspin, Cranston and Mitchell, most Democrats praised the invasion on 
grounds that it apparently has restored democracy to Panama. And many concluded 
that the President was left with "no choice" but to invade Panama after 
Saturday night's killing of an unarmed American Marine officer in civilian 
clothes by Noriega's forces. 
</P>
<P>
"Noriega was making a laughingstock of the United States," said Rep. Bill 
Richardson (D-N.M.) "He was baiting us." 
</P>
<P>
The President was legally justified to invade Panama, most members said, 
especially because American lives and the Panama Canal Treaties were in 
jeopardy and because efforts to negotiate a solution through the Organization 
of American States had failed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we were playing the Lone Ranger on this one," Richardson added. 
</P>
<P>
But although they were clearly in the minority, at least six Democratic members 
of Congress -- Reps. Don Edwards, Anthony C. Beilenson and Ronald Dellums of 
California, Charles B. Rangel and Ted Weiss of New York and Henry Gonzalez of 
Texas -- spoke out forcefully against the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards called the invasion "a trigger-happy act of gunboat diplomacy that 
continues our mindless, 100-year abuse of small Central American nations." 
</P>
<P>
But most in Congress responded favorably. Bush had every reason to believe they 
would, especially because many Democrats and Republicans had lambasted him for 
failing to assist in a failed coup attempt against Noriega last Oct. 3. Some 
members believe he acted in part to satisfy the many complaints he was hearing 
from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The White House informed the top four leaders of the House and Senate of the 
planned assault just before it was launched late Tuesday and contacted other 
key members of Congress once the operation was under way. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) a senior Foreign Relations Committee member, called 
the action "an overwhelming success because democracy has now been inaugurated 
and installed in Panama." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, even some of those who praised the operation 
expressed fears that the President's decision to solve the problem with 
military force might ultimately backfire. 
</P>
<P>
The House Armed Services Committee will hold hearings in January to look into 
some apparent glitches in the military operation, according to Aspin. Among 
other things, he said, the committee will try to determine why U.S. troops 
failed to capture Noriega immediately and why Panamanian forces were permitted 
to take American hostages during the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said he had raised several misgivings 
about the invasion when the President telephoned him Tuesday night. Foley 
staunchly refused to express any of these concerns publicly until American 
troops return home. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's ability to elude U.S. intelligence forces clearly disturbed many 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"What I don't understand . . . is why we don't have Noriega himself," Sen. 
Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) declared. "We've been following him daily for months 
on end, and there are not that many places to hide. Until we have Noriega, this 
operation can't be deemed a total success." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who said he did not want to "second-guess" 
the President's decision, also complained that "this unilateral military 
intervention may do long-term damage to our foreign policy, to our ability to 
work with other nations in Latin American and to our goal of achieving lasting 
democracy in the region." 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate subcommittee on 
Latin American affairs, said, "The Latin reaction is a good one at this point. 
The reaction is one of silence, and that would have to be interpreted as benign 
support." 
</P>
<P>
One recurring theme in the many statements issued by members of Congress was 
the need for the President to comply with the War Powers Resolution, which 
gives Congress up to 90 days to object whenever U.S. forces are placed in 
hostile action by the President without a traditional declaration of war. 
</P>
<P>
Under the War Powers Resolution, the President also must notify Congress within 
48 hours after the start of such an invasion. But no President -- neither 
Republican nor Democrat -- has ever recognized the constitutionality of the 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Rangel, one of the leading critics of the attack, ridiculed Bush's contention 
that he was forced to move into Panama because of the slaying of an American 
citizen by Panamanian forces and the harassment of others. 
</P>
<P>
"If that is so, far more happens on the streets of New York every day and 
night, and I say that too is enough," Rangel declared. "Why are we not 
providing massive assistance to our state and local people in cities and towns 
where the real war on drugs is being waged?" 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said, "There is no question that Noriega is a corrupt monster." But he 
added that "Panama is an artificial thing wrenched from Colombia (at the 
beginning of the century) as a convenience to us," and concluded, "Today's 
action is simply the culmination of a bankrupt, failed policy of using and 
abusing Panama."

PANAMA: OFFICIALS ACROSS THE REGION ASSAIL THE INTERVENTION. THEY PREDICT A

<P>
Latin American leaders, even those who shared Washington's aim of ending Gen. 
Manuel A. Noriega's dictatorship in Panama, overwhelmingly condemned the U.S. 
military invasion there Wednesday and refrained from recognizing his 
American-installed successor. 
</P>
<P>
After a flurry of urgent telephone consultations begun before dawn, officials 
across the Western Hemisphere declared that the Bush Administration had 
violated their cherished principle of nonintervention. Although their outrage 
was muted by what many called Noriega's infamy as a criminal dictator, they 
warned that a regional crisis could develop unless U.S. troops withdraw quickly 
from Panama. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first protests came from Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, a 
staunch foe of Noriega. He said the U.S. action "revived an era in 
inter-American relations that was thought to have been surpassed." 
</P>
<P>
Scattered anti-American street demonstrations were reported from Mexico City to 
Montevideo. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua's Sandinista rulers, fearful of a related U.S. military attack 
against them, put their armed forces on a "state of combative general alert" 
and deployed troops, tanks and anti-aircraft guns in the streets of Managua. 
</P>
<P>
News of the Panama attack stunned Latin Americans. It touched their 
nationalistic nerve like no other event since American troops swarmed over the 
Caribbean island of Grenada in 1983 and quickly toppled a Marxist government. 
As in Panama, the official U.S. justification in Grenada was to defend the 
lives of American citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some previous U.S. military actions, notably a 1965 intervention in the 
Dominican Republic, the one in Panama failed to win the support of the 
Organization of American States. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in special session in Washington, the OAS refused to seat a 
representative of the new Panamanian government and met with Noriega's delegate 
to the body. It also agreed to consider a motion by Nicaragua, Noriega's 
closest regional ally, to denounce the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday, President Bush had received high marks from his Latin 
neighbors for backing away from military solutions to Central American 
conflicts, an approach in tune with the recent peaceful changes in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Several Latin leaders pointedly remarked Wednesday that Bush was out of step. 
"We have not been told why, when Europe is on the peaceful road to 
democratization, force is still used in Latin America," complained Guatemalan 
President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo. 
</P>
<P>
President Jose Sarney of Brazil called the U.S. action "a step backward in 
international relations." 
</P>
<P>
Mexico urged "an immediate cessation of hostilities" in Panama, even while 
noting Noriega's ties to drug traffickers. "Fighting international crime is no 
excuse for intervention in a sovereign nation," said a Mexican communique. 
</P>
<P>
Similar condemnation came from Chile's military government, the civilian 
coalition elected last week to replace it and Costa Rican President Oscar Arias 
Sanchez. Chile expressed concern over blockage of the Panama Canal, a vital 
waterway for its exports. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S.-backed government in El Salvador said the United States "was using 
its legitimate right of defense," wire services reported. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Francisco Merino said, "This type of actions could permit the 
Panamanian people to identify with a democratic process, to reestablish an 
elected government," Merino added. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Edna Charles of the island of Dominica, President Ronald 
Reagan's most vocal champion during the Grenada invasion, declined to comment 
on the action in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
In a sign that the dispute could damage U.S. interests in the region, Peruvian 
President Alan Garcia recalled his ambassador from Washington and suggested 
postponement of a scheduled Feb. 15 summit among Bush and the leaders of Peru, 
Colombia and Bolivia to coordinate efforts against drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Several presidents said Bush or Vice President Dan Quayle telephoned them 
Wednesday morning, not to consult but to inform them of an invasion already 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassadors then called on officials in each country to ask them to 
recognize the just-installed government of Guillermo Endara, who was elected 
president of Panama by popular vote last May in a vote nullified by Noriega. 
None did so. 
</P>
<P>
The situation posed a dilemma for some Latin governments. After the Panamanian 
election was voided, the OAS tried to mediate between Noriega and his foes but 
was rebuffed by the general and failed to agree on strong diplomatic sanctions 
sought by the United States and some Latin countries. 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's government acknowledged Wednesday that the U.S. invasion resulted 
from the "lack of an effective and firm response by our countries to the 
violation of human rights and constitutional norms" in Panama. But it said the 
U.S. invasion force must go home before Venezuela can recognize Endara's 
ability to run the country on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"The Latin Americans are going to have to make political judgments based on how 
neat and clean or messy the situation in Panama is over the next few days," 
said Richard Nuccio, a senior associate at the Washington-based Inter-American 
Dialogue, a think tank of Western Hemisphere leaders and academics. "They must 
express outrage at a violation of Panama's sovereignty, but in private they are 
saying, 'Thank goodness Noriega is gone.' 
</P>
<P>
"But if American troops have to stay in Panama a long time, fighting a 
guerrilla war against Noriega's men or creating a new Panamanian army, then the 
(Latins') adherence to principles will be stronger and many of them will not 
recognize (Endara). That will put them on a collision course with the United 
States," Nuccio added. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting a view held privately by some Latin statesmen, Colombian political 
analyst Rodrigo Losada called the U.S. intervention "appropriate" because 
Panamanian democracy had been frustrated by a "situation of force." He 
predicted the Americans would withdraw soon, having caused only "temporary 
tensions" in inter-American relations. 
</P>
<P>
But several Latin American officials said they were uncertain whether Endara 
could control Panama without long-term U.S. intervention and said they prefer a 
solution that would include new elections in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
If that does not happen, the U.S. action could play into the hands of the left. 
Fidel Castro's government in Cuba declared that the invasion offers "incredible 
proof of U.S. contempt for international law." Some officials elsewhere 
wondered if Bush has turned Noriega into a hero for future generations of Latin 
guerrillas.

<P>
The Fighting 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops captured or dispersed most members of the Panama Defense Forces, 
but fighting continued through the day. Panamanian leader Manuel A. Noriega 
remained in hiding. The United States offered $1 million for information 
leading to his capture. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said in a televised address that he ordered American troops into 
action "to protect the lives of American citizens in Panama and bring Gen. 
Manuel Antonio Noriega to justice in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Casualties 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen American servicemen and one American civilian were reported killed. One 
hospital reported at least 52 other people died.

LEGALITY OF U.S. INVASION SPURS DEBATE

The Bush Administration stressed four legal justifications Wednesday for its 
invasion of Panama: the protection of American lives, the defense of the Panama 
Canal, the backing of the nation's "democratically elected" officials and the 
pursuit of an indicted U.S. drug criminal -- namely, Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
International law experts said the first reason is the strongest and the last 
the weakest. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they can make a much more plausible case for this than the invasion of 
Grenada (in 1983) or the Dominican Republic in the '60s," said American 
University law professor Robert K. Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
Because thousands of Americans are scattered around Panama and Noriega's troops 
have shown a willingness to harass and even kill them, President Bush had 
reason to use military force to protect them, Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Reagan Administration justified its invasion of Grenada by 
pointing to the danger faced by a small group of American medical students, a 
rationale that was rebutted by international law bodies. Critics noted that the 
students could have been evacuated without U.S. troops overthrowing Grenada's 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Under the norms of international law, nations are justified in using military 
force abroad to defend their citizens from hostile military action. But the 
response also must be limited to the amount of force necessary to protect the 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The classic example of such a military move, law experts said, was the 1976 
Israel raid on the Ugandan air base of Entebbe. Landing there, Israel commandos 
rescued their citizens who had been held hostage and then left, without 
attacking Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. 
</P>
<P>
Several law experts, while agreeing on the need to defend American lives in 
Panama, questioned whether a full-scale invasion is justified under 
international law. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have the killing of a Marine and the beating of the Navy man, some 
response was certainly called for," said USC law professor Edwin Smith. 
"Whether it rises to the level of a threat to U.S. sovereign interests is 
another question." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia University professor Oscar Schachter said U.S. officials must show 
that the attacks on Americans were more than isolated incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they need to make a much stronger factual case than they have made so 
far," Schachter said. "If you have one man killed, you are not justified in 
bombing cities or killing lots of others. But if you can show a pattern of 
attacks, then you have a much stronger case. I don't think we know enough at 
this point to make a judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega and his few remaining allies would be hard-pressed to argue against the 
U.S. invasion in an international legal body such as the United Nations, the 
experts said, because he declared last weekend that his forces were in "a state 
of war" with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"That was his biggest blunder," Goldman said. "He badly overplayed his hand." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials made it clear that they still see the pursuit of 
Noriega as a criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
Staking out a new legal position last month, Justice Department lawyers said 
that U.S. military personnel can track down and apprehend drug traffickers 
abroad. In the past, U.S. law was understood to restrict the military from 
engaging in criminal law enforcement. But under their new interpretation, 
Administration lawyers said, that limitation applies only within the United 
States and not beyond its borders. 
</P>
<P>
International law experts scoffed at that justification for the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine," Goldman asked, "how we would react if another nation 
asserted the right to have its military engage in surreptitious kidnapings of 
Americans in this country?"

NORIEGA'S U.N. AMBASSADOR APPEALS FOR TRUCE

<P>
Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's ambassador to the United Nations on Wednesday urged 
the world body's Security Council to appeal to President Bush for a cease-fire 
in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Mirla Bellavita also asked the council to send international 
observers to monitor a withdrawal of U.S. troops from her nation. 
</P>
<P>
Bellavita earlier outlined the pro-Noriega strategy at a closed-door meeting of 
nearly 100 nonaligned members of the world body. The Security Council held an 
evening meeting on the Panama fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The ambassador contended that Noriega "still was in Panama, moving around for 
security reasons" but maintaining contact with members of the Panama Defense 
Forces. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing Bellavita and Nicaraguan Ambassador Alejandro Serrano Caldera, 
the nonaligned group adopted a declaration denouncing "this unacceptable act of 
intervention" and affirming its "solidarity with the Panamanian people." The 
statement also called on the United States to "cease immediately all military 
operations in Panama and to solve outstanding issues with that country through 
dialogue and negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua, which requested the Security Council session and which was to be the 
only non-member of the council to speak Wednesday, circulated a draft 
resolution that would condemn the invasion as a "flagrant violation of 
international law." It also would demand "immediate cessation of the invasion 
and withdrawal of troops." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has veto power over any Security Council actions. Chinese 
Ambassador Li Luye said, after emerging from informal consultations, that "most 
of the delegates want to have an immediate meeting." But he added that "one or 
two wanted more time." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. strategy was to adopt a waiting stance as the search for Noriega went on 
and as more than 24,000 troops moved to crush Noriega's forces and consolidate 
the position of Guillermo Endara, the U.S.-backed president. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict in Panama was mirrored at the United Nations when delegates loyal 
to Noriega vowed to remain as Panama's official voice. 
</P>
<P>
But the Endara administration sent its own U.N. ambassador, Harvard University 
scholar Eduardo Vallarino, who remained in a nearby hotel while Noriega 
supporters retained possession of their plush offices just north of the U.N. 
headquarters. The Noriega diplomats entered their mission at 6 a.m. Wednesday 
and instructed building staff members to bar visitors. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told reporters that the council had agreed 
not to hear either of the Panamanian factions. Panama is not a council member. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day Wednesday, an atmosphere of crisis gripped the world body. 
Members of the Security Council met in informal deliberations as consensus 
built for the formal session.

TWO GERMANYS PREPARING FOR MAJOR SPY SWAP; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: THE EXCHANGE, INVOLVING 28 PEOPLE, IS MEANT TO PROVIDE A CLEAN SLATE 
FOR EAST-WEST COOPERATION.

<TEXT>
<P>
The West German government announced Wednesday that one of the biggest ever 
exchanges of spies with East Germany could occur before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn said it will soon swap four Communist-run agents in return for the release 
of 24 accused Western operatives held by East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after West German President Richard von Weizsaecker 
reported that he had pardoned two government secretaries who had passed state 
secrets to their Communist agent-lovers. 
</P>
<P>
After West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's talks with East German Prime 
Minister Hans Modrow in Dresden, West Germany's minister for inner-German 
affairs, Dorothee Wilms, declared of the negotiated spy exchange: 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this means the chapter of prisoners and agents is now ended. That is 
the prerequisite for the two governments to cooperate in trust." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kohl and Modrow agreed that Berlin's most famous symbol, the 
Brandenburg Gate, should be opened to pedestrian traffic Friday. Both leaders 
are expected to attend the ceremony, which would be a final, significant 
breaching of the Berlin Wall, in the eyes of most Germans. 
</P>
<P>
In Dresden, concluding his two-day, first visit to East Germany, Kohl met with 
opposition and church leaders and urged them to help shape future relations 
between the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference that Bonn would like, as soon as possible, to assist 
in dealing with such joint East-West German problems as rebuilding the 
railroads, enhancing the environment and installing modern communications 
between the states. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's proposals came on the same day that the Communist Party daily newspaper 
Neues Deutschland reported that East German industrial output decreased by 2.5% 
last month. The account attributed the fall to the exodus of East German 
workers, which led to the crisis that eventually saw the Communist Party regime 
overthrown. 
</P>
<P>
The paper's official report confirmed accounts circulating in diplomatic 
circles that the East German regime had been misreporting economic figures to 
show the economy in much better shape than is actually the case. 
</P>
<P>
The paper reported serious consumer good shortages and reduced ability to 
fulfill export commitments. 
</P>
<P>
In West Berlin on Wednesday, the West German opposition Social Democratic Party 
ended its three-day annual conference by pledging to work for unity with East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We will strive for a state of peace in Europe in which the German people find 
unity in free self-determination," the party said in its concluding statement. 
</P>
<P>
In a "Berlin Declaration" approved Monday, the party indicated that it is 
planning to draw up ways of cooperating with East Germany that could lead to 
some kind of confederation. 
</P>
<P>
Party leaders expressed concern that Kohl's Christian Democrats may capitalize 
on the opening of the Berlin Wall and the German reunification issue to win 
another term in next December's national election. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, sources said Von Weizsaecker's pardoning of the two secretaries, Elke 
Falk and Margret Hoeke, both West German citizens, was part of a deal that had 
been worked out between Walter Priesnitz, a senior Bonn official, and East 
German lawyer Wolfgang Vogel. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeke had been a secretary in Von Weizsaecker's own office. She was sentenced 
to eight years in prison in August, 1987, when she admitted handing over state 
papers to her boyfriend, who worked for the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
Falk worked in several Bonn ministries, including the chancellor's office, and 
was jailed for 6 1/2 years last May. 
</P>
<P>
She said she had passed secret documents to her control agent, whom she met 
through a newspaper lonely-hearts column in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
The two women presumably will be allowed to remain in West Germany if they 
choose to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel has long been identified with spy exchanges, beginning with the swap of 
American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers for Soviet master spy Rudolf Abel.

BRITAIN TO GRANT CITIZENSHIP TO COLONY'S ELITE; 
</P>
<P>
HONG KONG: LONDON'S PLAN APPLIES TO FEWER THAN 4% OF THE RESIDENTS. THE 
'STRICTLY LIMITED' PROGRAM COMES UNDER IMMEDIATE ATTACK IN COMMONS. 
</P>

<P>
In an admitted compromise between the lingering responsibilities of a lost 
empire and the danger of ethnic unrest at home, the British government 
announced Wednesday that it will grant full citizenship to fewer than 4% of 
Hong Kong's 5.7 million residents before the colony reverts to Chinese rule in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
The "strictly limited" program will extend to a maximum of 50,000 civil 
servants, professional and business people whose service is determined under a 
points system to be particularly valuable to Hong Kong, Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd said in a long-awaited statement to an angrily divided House of 
Commons. 
</P>
<P>
Including dependents, Hurd added, it means that an estimated 225,000 Hong Kong 
residents would gain the right of British residence as a "safety net" against 
the uncertainty of 1997's scheduled transfer of power. 
</P>
<P>
The plan came under immediate attack from both the opposition Labor Party and 
Hurd's fellow Conservative Party members. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Kaufman, Labor's foreign affairs spokesman, charged that the 
government's approach "is not simply elitist and discriminatory, but . . . in 
our view wrong in principle." 
</P>
<P>
But Kaufman did not spell out what Labor would do instead, and the party has 
never been specific on the issue either. 
</P>
<P>
Even more bitter criticism, however, came in an attack by former Conservative 
Party chairman and ex-Cabinet minister Norman Tebbit, who told Hurd that "I 
disagreed with almost everything you said." 
</P>
<P>
Tebbit represents a group of rebel Conservatives who see the government's plan 
as a violation of party pledges that there would be no more large-scale 
immigration into Britain. 
</P>
<P>
While they have sharply different reasons for opposing the government plan, 
there is a real prospect that Labor and the rebel Tories might successfully 
block government legislation to implement the Hong Kong scheme, thus handing 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher an embarrassing legislative defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd stressed that the government's purpose is "not to encourage immigration 
into this country, but to persuade to remain in Hong Kong those whom we need to 
retain there if our last substantial colony is to pass successfully through the 
final eight years of British rule." 
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary described the mood in the colony as "at a low ebb" after 
the massacre of a pro-democracy demonstrator in Beijing last June and resulting 
fears over the scheduled transfer of control of Hong Kong under the 1984 
Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem of confidence is shown by increasing emigration from the 
territory, and increasing numbers of people who contemplate leaving," Hurd 
said. He said 42,000 people have left Hong Kong this year and 55,000 more are 
expected to follow in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"A growing proportion of these people are those whom Hong Kong can least afford 
to lose," Hurd said. "This hemorrhage of talent puts at risk the 
competitiveness of Hong Kong's economy, the efficiency of its public service, 
the effectiveness of its education system -- in short, its future." 
</P>
<P>
The Thatcher government is gambling that many of those who might otherwise 
leave Hong Kong would not do so if assured that after the Chinese take over, 
they would have the protection of British citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
About 3.2 million of Hong Kong's 5.7 million residents already hold either 
British Dependent Territories Citizen or British National Overseas passports. 
But neither document carries with it the right to live or work in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Some argue that Britain owes full citizenship to all Hong Kong's residents. But 
Hurd said such a step would "create unacceptable strains here." 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 5% of Britain's 56 million citizens belong to ethnic minorities, 
most of them Afro-Caribbeans and Asians. Still, an influential committee of 
Parliament members said in a separate report issued Wednesday that "racism and 
its most ugly manifestations -- racial attacks and harassment -- are still 
frightening realities for many British citizens." 
</P>
<P>
In an apparent concession to the Tory rebels, Hurd stressed that not all 50,000 
"assurances" would be distributed immediately. He also promised that "the 
scheme would cease by 1997." 
</P>
<P>
Said the foreign secretary: "We have eventually worked out what we believe to 
be the most sensible balance between our desire for good race relations and 
harmony in our cities and our very strong feeling that we have a continuing 
sense of responsibility to people in Hong Kong." 
</P>
<P>
Addressing Tebbit, he added: "This is the last main chapter in the story of 
this country's empire. I am rather keen, and I'm sure you are rather keen, that 
the last chapter should not end in a shabby way." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to their importance to Hong Kong and the extent to which people in 
the same category of employment are emigrating, Hurd said, the 50,000 heads of 
household covered under the plan will be selected according to length of 
service and knowledge of the English language. 
</P>
<P>
The government will introduce enabling legislation "at the earliest 
opportunity," he promised. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd also stressed that all Hong Kong's major trading partners have a strong 
interest in the colony's continued stability. Now that Britain has taken the 
lead in providing assurances to Hong Kong residents, he noted, "we shall now be 
asking our partners and allies to follow." 
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the British news service Reuters reported, the proposal was 
described as inadequate and potentially divisive. Legislators and lobbying 
groups pledged to fight on for the rights of all 3.25 million British subjects 
in the colony. 
</P>
<P>
"The number falls far short of our request. We remain committed to pressing the 
case for all Hong Kong British subjects," Legislative Councilor Rosanna Tam 
said. 
</P>
<P>
British Citizens for Hong Kong, a group of about 800 expatriate Britons living 
in the colony, denounced the package, calling it "a divisive and dishonorable 
gesture of dismissal" by Britain.

A Louisiana processor is voluntarily recalling about 1,000 pounds of a frozen 
pork and rice product because it might be contaminated with a food-poisoning 
organism, Listeria monocytogenes, the Agriculture Department reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bodin Foods Inc. of New Iberia, La., sells the product through small 
distributors in Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
It is sold frozen in vacuum-sealed plastic packages with the name "Boo Dan 
(Boudin Link) Traditional Cajun Pudding" on the label and "Est. 8214" printed 
inside the USDA inspection seal. Each 10-ounce package sold in groceries 
contains two links and is shipped 12 to a carton. 
</P>
<P>
Listeriosis was described as "a rare but potentially serious" disease. Most 
vulnerable are those with weakened immune systems, including infants, the 
elderly and the chronically ill. 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms include the sudden onset of flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, 
headache, respiratory distress, backache, loss of appetite and sometimes 
abdominal pain and diarrhea.

ON MEAN STREETS, THE COLD IS A KILLER;

A frigid blast of arctic air riding the jet stream far to the south has brought 
record low temperatures to much of the Midwest and East, leaving America's 
rising homeless population, including an unprecedented number of women and 
small children, in a grim, pre-Christmas fight for survival. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be crazy . . . unfortunately, some people are going to die, I 
think," said David Roth, a member of a Chicago homeless task force. 
</P>
<P>
Police have already seen a dramatic increase this week in deaths from exposure 
and hypothermia. At least four deaths among the homeless in New York over the 
weekend were blamed on the cold, and other deaths were reported in Detroit and 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, emergency shelters in virtually every city are filled to capacity, 
leaving thousands of others to search for warmth in abandoned buildings, heat 
grates, dumpsters or bus terminals. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought of hell as freezing, but it is more depressing out there right 
now than you can ever imagine," said Darlene Feldman, a suburban Detroit woman 
who has started a volunteer effort to hand out blankets among Detroit's 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"This cold is scary for people who work with the homeless," added Bill Faith, a 
member of the Ohio Coalition of Homelessness in Cleveland. "It's not just a 
matter of trying to provide assistance, it's a matter of trying to make sure 
people survive." 
</P>
<P>
The sheer numbers of homeless make this week's icy blast even more dangerous; a 
survey released Wednesday by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that the 
demand for emergency shelter has risen by as much as 25% in major cities this 
winter. A lack of affordable housing, along with increased drug abuse, has led 
to huge increases in requests for shelter in 24 of the 27 cities surveyed by 
the mayors' group. 
</P>
<P>
"We turn away people every night because there is not enough room," said Nelda 
Clarke, director of program services at the Salvation Army's Harbor Light 
Center in Minneapolis. "And one of our greatest fears is that someone turned 
away will freeze." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, in this last winter of the 1980s -- the decade when America 
re-learned the harsh Depression-era terminology of homelessness -- the makeup 
of the homeless population is changing. The National Coalition for the Homeless 
estimated Wednesday that 1 million of the 3 million homeless in the nation are 
families, a dramatic change from the early 1980s, when most homeless were 
single men. 
</P>

"Increasingly, the face of hunger in America is the face of a young child," 
said Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, who released the mayors' report. 
</P>
<P>
And, while private, volunteer efforts are spreading throughout the country, the 
economic slowdown that seems to be just around the corner could make conditions 
far more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is getting much worse, the crisis is speeding up," said Mitch 
Snyder, a homeless advocate with the Washington-based Community for Creative 
Non-Violence. "If we have a bad recession, we could have 5 to 10 million people 
on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Jean Doutcher of St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Atlanta agrees; she helps 
out at a soup kitchen where the lines of the hungry keep growing. "We have a 
limit of 500 people that we feed," Doutcher said. "And when we reach that limit 
we close the door. So it is not a question of feeding more people, it is a 
question of turning more people away from our door, hungry. That is happening 
more and more." 
</P>
<P>
In New York, where homelessness has long been at crisis levels -- with as many 
as 90,000 people living on the streets -- new nuisance abatement regulations in 
commuter train stations are coming under fire for forcing the homeless out into 
below freezing temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
The city's new transit rules are designed to get the homeless out of the train 
and subway stations and into city-run shelters, in response to mounting 
complaints from suburban commuters about having to wade through a tide of 
homeless people to get to their trains. Officials at Grand Central Station, for 
instance, have set aside some areas of its terminal only for passengers with 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
New York's transit police say they have established a new policy not to eject 
anyone from the subways in sub-freezing weather, but homeless advocates say the 
homeless are still being forced out of the stations and into New York's 
crime-ridden and drug-infested public shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"They are throwing people from the subways out into the street, rounding them 
up to go to the city shelters where they don't want to go in the first place," 
said John Turcott, of the Partnership for the Homeless in New York. "It's 
particularly cruel in this particularly cold winter to do this." 
</P>
<P>
But in other cities around the nation, volunteers are stepping forward during 
the holiday season, offering increasingly imaginative ways to spread some 
Christmas good will. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, for example, a major hotel has decorated a Christmas tree with 
hundreds of angel ornaments, each with the name of a homeless adult or child; 
volunteers who then take one ornament are asked to give a Christmas gift to the 
person listed on their ornament. So far, the hotel has taken in 300 gifts that 
it will deliver to homeless shelters in the city. 
</P>
<P>
And in Detroit, Darlene Feldman has become known as the "blanket lady," for 
single-handedly starting her new organization that passes out blankets on the 
streets, to reach those homeless who never go to shelters. 
</P>
<P>
She has now won the heartfelt appreciation of the hard-bitten people on 
Detroit's streets, and her station wagon has become an especially welcome sight 
on these bitterly cold days and nights. 
</P>
<P>
"When I come up with a blanket," she says "they act like they've won the 
lottery." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers Tracy Shryer in Chicago, Leslie Eringaard in Detroit, Lianne Hart 
in Houston, Lisa Romaine in New York, Ann Rovin in Denver, Edith Stanley in 
Atlanta and Anna Virtue in Miami contributed to this story.

Overnight temperatures dropped to at least freezing across most of the nation 
Wednesday, and the upper Midwest braced for temperatures on the first day of 
winter as low as 40 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just about as bad as it can get in Iowa," National Weather Service 
forecaster Scott Truett said in Des Moines. "Normally, the coldest weather of 
the year occurs in January and February. We are way below normal." 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures have been running 20 degrees to 30 degrees below normal across the 
state, with similar differences elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Snow fell Wednesday from the northern Rockies across the northern plains and 
around the Great Lakes, where "lake effect" snow fed by the moisture of the 
lakes piled up 4-foot drifts in western New York state. 
</P>
<P>
The weather service's official low temperature for the Lower 48 states 
Wednesday was 34 degrees below zero at International Falls and Warroad, Minn., 
both on the Canadian border. The high Wednesday at International Falls was 21 
degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight temperatures reached 32 degrees or lower in southern North Carolina, 
western South Carolina, northern Georgia, northern Alabama, northern 
Mississippi, much of Louisiana, the northern two-thirds of Texas, New Mexico 
and the northeastern two-thirds of Arizona, the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of North Dakota were warned Wednesday to prepare for temperatures as 
low as 40 degrees below zero, with northwesterly winds blowing at 15 to 25 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Similar readings were forecast in Wisconsin, and some schools closed to avoid 
having children waiting outside for buses. Some schools had frozen water pipes. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature at noon at Eagle River, Wis., was 15 below and it was windy, 
school spokesman Ken Johnson said. "It is a long way from a blizzard, but if 
you are not behind a windbreak, it's cold," he said.

MINNESOTANS GET APOLOGY FROM SEN. DURENBERGER OVER FINANCES

Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.) made a public apology Wednesday to the people 
of Minnesota, breaking a yearlong silence to say "I have let you down" and 
admitting "mistakes and . . . lapses of judgment" in handling his personal 
finances over the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger's apology, which he made at four news conferences in Minnesota, was 
offered in the midst of a Senate Ethics Committee investigation into whether he 
evaded limits on honorariums in collecting $100,000 in 1985-86 under an unusual 
book contract or broke Senate rules in soliciting trips from special interest 
groups to visit Boston on personal business. 
</P>
<P>
The senator admitted no violations of law or Senate rules. But he said: "I 
failed to appreciate the appearance of what I was doing. For the disappointment 
and embarrassment I've caused my family, supporters and friends -- and all 
Minnesotans -- I am deeply sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger said in a telephone interview that his decision to ignore his 
attorneys' advice and answer questions was triggered mainly by a Minneapolis 
Star-Tribune report earlier this month that disclosed he has been charging the 
Senate rent for staying at his own condominium in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Stanoch, chairwoman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said 
she found the timing of Durenberger's statement curious because he would not 
comment on his finances during his reelection campaign last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger noted that the expense of having residences in Washington and in 
Minnesota and raising four college-age sons led him to try "to find a way -- 
within the rules -- of both increasing my income and reducing my expenses."

12-YEAR-OLD BOY FACES CHARGE OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A 12-year-old boy accused of fatally shooting a friend in a City of Orange mall 
jammed with Christmas shoppers was charged with involuntary manslaughter 
Wednesday and ordered held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County public defender appointed to represent Juan Manuel Cardenas 
entered a plea of innocent, but did not object to a prosecution request to keep 
Juan in county Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Juan has slept little since the shooting Monday and keeps waking up in fits of 
"incredible horror at what he's done," said his lawyer, Orange County Deputy 
Public Defender Chris Hilger. "When I talk to him, I get the feeling he's only 
half there." 
</P>
<P>
"He knows what he did. He knows he's responsible," Hilger added. "At least he's 
struggling with that right now." 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Juan said the boy had been showing off a .25-caliber pistol and its 
bullets for weeks. Minutes before the shooting, he allegedly held it to the 
temple of another girl, Keli Edwards. Then he pointed the weapon at Jacalyn 
Calabrese, 12, who dared him to pull the trigger, police say. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Conley said the involuntary manslaughter 
charge was selected because the horseplay with a loaded gun, even for a 
12-year-old, was criminally negligent. Juan was also charged with assault with 
a deadly weapon for pointing the gun at Keli, and with using a gun to commit a 
felony. 
</P>
<P>
Juan was kept in handcuffs during the hearing. He answered yes or no in a 
hoarse voice to the judge's questions. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge C. Robert Jameson told Juan that the three 
charges carry a total maximum sentence of 10 years. But both prosecution and 
defense attorneys said the boy is so young that it is impossible to predict 
what his punishment will be if he is found guilty. The case will be tried by a 
Superior Court judge assigned to the juvenile division, without a jury. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's father, Al Calabrese, said he has forgiven his daughter's killer. 
"How do you punish stupidity?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have declined to say where the boy got the gun. But Calabrese said 
it is the gun owner who should be blamed for his daughter's death.

Timber industry spokesmen Wednesday attacked a federal proposal to declare the 
northern spotted owl a threatened species in California and Oregon woodlands. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony submitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, they asserted 
that owls live just as well in managed timber lands as they do in old forests. 
</P>
<P>
The owl has become an issue in the ongoing battle between environmentalists and 
the timber industry over logging in Northern California and other parts of the 
Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Industry leaders charge that the environmental movement's promotion of the owl 
for "threatened" or "endangered" status is really aimed at curbing logging of 
older trees on private land.

Mendocino County's first Municipal judge is a lawyer who freely admitted that 
he had smoked marijuana in the past. 
</P>
<P>
But then so did the other two finalists for the $82,000-a-year judicial post in 
the Northern California county renowned for growing pot. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the experience will make better judges of them," said Mendocino 
County Supervisor Norman de Vall. "I think it brings a sense of reality into 
the courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors, by a 3-2 vote Tuesday, chose Kirk Gustafson, 45, of 
Willits as the new judge over attorneys George Nelson and John Behnke. 
</P>
<P>
The three finalists were selected from a list of 16 applicants to fill the post 
created from a consolidation of existing justice courts. 
</P>
<P>
A call-in survey by a local radio station found that residents, by a margin of 
3 to 1, did not oppose a judge simply because he had smoked marijuana at one 
time.

SCIENCE VOLCANOLOGY;

ERUPTION PRECEDED BY SMALL BOOST IN GRAVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British researchers have found "the first unambiguous evidence" that small 
changes in gravity can precede a volcanic eruption. 
</P>
<P>
In an article published today in the journal Nature the researchers report that 
gravity increased at the Poas volcano in Costa Rica over a two-year period 
before the volcano erupted in April and May of 1989. The increased gravity was 
thought to result from the intrusion of dense molten rock into the volcanic 
cone. 
</P>
<P>
Geophysicists Helen Rymer and Geoff Brown of the Open University in Milton 
Keynes, England, believe that measurements of very small changes in gravity -- 
called microgravity -- can be used to predict eruptions of certain types of 
volcanoes like Poas. 
</P>
<P>
Rymer speculated that Poas may erupt again next April or May. 
</P>
<P>
Rymer and Brown are also now beginning to monitor microgravity at Mt. Etna in 
Sicily, where the population in the area is threatened by periodic eruptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Microgravity would seem to be a very promising technique that should be used 
(for predicting volcanic eruptions)," said geophysicist Dan Dzurisin of the 
U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory in Washington. But the 
technique has yet to be tested, in part, because monitoring changes in 
microgravity is an extremely labor-intensive process that cannot be readily 
automated. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, most studies have measured microgravity changes only at long 
intervals, often simply before and after a volcanic eruption, and the results 
have been open to various interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
The Rymer and Brown study, in which microgravity was measured at regular 
intervals over a 10-year period, "represents the first time we can see a 
progression in microgravity over a long period of time" so that the results are 
much clearer, said geologist Al Eggers of the University of Puget Sound in 
Tacoma, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Measuring gravitational changes is extraordinarily exacting, Dzurisin said. The 
accelerometers that are used are highly sensitive and easily get out of 
calibration, he said. It is thus necessary to calibrate the instruments 
frequently by moving them to a site where gravity does not change, requiring a 
constant human presence. 
</P>
<P>
The process is even more complicated because the accelerometers are sensitive 
to slight changes in elevation -- changes as small as fractions of an inch. (If 
the device is raised an inch, for example, it is that much farther from the 
center of the Earth, so that the pull of gravity is slightly less.) 
</P>
<P>
Measurements of gravity must be accompanied by highly accurate measurements of 
the level of land at the measurement site so that changes in elevation -- which 
often occur before volcanic eruptions -- are not misinterpreted as actual 
changes in gravity. 
</P>
<P>
Poas volcano is a classical cone-shaped volcano with a clear, deep (120 to 150 
feet) lake in its center. The lake is normally quite warm, about 104 degrees 
Fahrenheit, indicating that at least some molten rock lies close to the surface 
and heats it. 
</P>
<P>
After the volcano's last eruption in 1953, the lake filled to its normal depth 
and remained stable for three decades. But in 1983, Rymer said in a telephone 
interview, the lake's level began dropping slowly. 
</P>
<P>
By 1987, when Rymer and Brown began detecting an increase in microgravity, the 
lake level was dropping much more rapidly. Rymer believes the molten rock, or 
magma, that was causing the gravity to increase was also heating the water and 
making it evaporate faster. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, geysers of water began erupting and the water level went down 
even faster. By April of this year, the water was gone and the volcano erupted 
in a mile-high cloud of ash. The ash eruptions subsided when spring rains 
re-established the lake, Rymer said, but she believes the volcano may erupt 
again as the lake is depleted during the coming dry season. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers do not know what happened to gravity levels after the eruption 
because their funding expired at about the same time the volcano erupted. But 
they will go back to Costa Rica in March to take new measurements. 
</P>
<P>
The lessons learned at Poas may not be applicable everywhere. Although Japanese 
researchers have some preliminary evidence of increases in microgravity before 
volcanic eruptions, Eggers found that microgravity actually decreased at Pacayo 
volcano in Guatemala before an eruption 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers speculates that the decrease was caused by formation of gaseous pockets 
in the magma. 
</P>
<P>
Still other volcanoes monitored by Dzurisin and others have shown no apparent 
changes. But it is likely, Dzurisin said, that each volcano has its own 
characteristic pattern of gravity changes and that once those changes are 
known, the pattern can be used for future predictions. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Rymer noted, both Poas and Mt. Etna are filled with very light 
material, so that the intrusion of magma is more readily detected. In such 
cases, she said, gravity changes should be a particularly useful predictive 
tool.

American companies in Panama shut their offices Wednesday and checked on 
employees' safety, as the U.S. military's attack sent the Central American 
nation's deeply troubled economy into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
With sporadic fighting continuing, Panama's main airport remained shut to 
commercial traffic, and the Panama Canal was closed for most of the day, its 
first combat-related closure in 75 years. 
</P>
<P>
A spot check of U.S. companies, including Bank of America, Eastman Kodak and 
Citibank, found that none opened for business Wednesday. In addition, none 
reported harm to their employees or facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"People were advised to stay home, and they did," said Cynthia Stone, a public 
affairs director for Citibank, which operates nine branches in Panama with more 
than 200 employees, none American. 
</P>
<P>
Senator Lines U.S.A., a San Francisco-based freight company, said early 
Wednesday that its ship, Asian Senator, was being held in Cristobal on the 
canal's Atlantic side with a dozen Panamanian soldiers aboard. "What they want 
or intend to do, we have no idea," said Juergen Taub, company president. "But 
it was supposed to sail today for Long Beach and the Far East." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, a Senator Lines employee remained uncertain of the vessel's 
status. "We just want to get our ship out of there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While U.S. businesses inside Panama tried to keep a low profile, foreign 
shippers scrambled to consider alternate routes for the cargoes of South 
American fruit, California almonds and other products headed toward the 
country's famous 51-mile waterway. 
</P>
<P>
The canal reopened before the day was over, however, easing fears. "It's one 
thing if you're carrying hockey pucks," said John Dillon, vice president for 
traffic and sales at Chilean Lines in New York. "But fruit is perishable." 
</P>
<P>
The canal's brief closure was just the latest shock to a business community 
that has been hurt badly by U.S.-Panamanian feuding that has involved American 
economic sanctions and Panama's countermeasures, such as a partial freeze on 
bank assets. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the sanctions and restrictions on U.S. banks, there isn't a lot we 
can do and there hasn't been for some time," said James H. Mitchell, a 
spokesman for the Bank of America in San Francisco, which had six Panama 
branches in the early 1980s but now operates just one. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials expressed hope Wednesday that once the turmoil subsides, the 
long-term outlook for Panamanian business would improve. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's selling a lot of widgets today or tomorrow -- but once you have an 
established democratic government, it will be a significant help" to business 
and investment, a State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of an 81-mile U.S.-Panamanian oil pipeline venture temporarily 
stopped pumping oil early Wednesday after Panamanian soldiers guarding its 
Pacific Ocean terminal were called back to their garrisons, said Joseph J. 
Ackell, senior vice president with Northville Industries Corp. of Melville, 
N.Y., the pipeline's manager and co-owner. 
</P>
<P>
During the 14-hour shutdown, about 300 pipeline workers, mostly Panamanian 
nationals, remained at their posts, he said. The pipeline itself -- which 
carries Alaskan crude destined for East and Gulf Coast refineries -- was not 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
A small quantity of crude oil, about 100,000 barrels per day, also moves 
through the canal on tankers. Analysts said any closure of the canal would not 
significantly affect crude supplies, however. 
</P>
<P>
Still, fears that the Panama invasion might cause serious supply problems 
boosted prices of oil futures in early trading Wednesday. Prices generally fell 
back to opening levels after it became clear that the invasion would not 
seriously disrupt crude oil supplies. 
</P>
<P>
For U.S.-based companies, the outbreak of hostilities created a nerve-racking 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Eastman-Kodak, which has offices for marketing and warehousing to serve Panama 
and the Canal Zone, joined other enterprises in staying closed. "We told the 
employees to stay home. We're going to continue to monitor the situation," said 
Paul Allen, a spokesman for the Rochester, N.Y., company. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, Kodak has reduced its Panama staff from 125 employees to 100 
employees, including one U.S. national, and relied more heavily on Miami as a 
distribution point for Latin America and the Caribbean, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation into the country, by water and air, was paralyzed for much of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial flights were canceled because of the continuing closure of the 
Panama City Airport. Lan Airlines and Varig Airlines, which fly non-stop 
between Los Angeles and Panama City, operate those flights only on the 
weekends, so they have not yet been affected. 
</P>
<P>
Pan American World Airways, which has one flight daily from New York to Panama, 
has judged Panama to be so dangerous for the last three weeks that it has 
ordered crews to stay overnight in Costa Rica instead of Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to airline disruptions, a number of cruise liners monitored the 
status of the Panama Canal with concern. 
</P>
<P>
Holland America Lines rescheduled the Noordam, a ship leaving today from Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., that normally stops at Gatun Lake in the Canal Zone. Instead, 
the ship will be rerouted through La Guaira, Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
"We are watching the situation hour by hour" said Jennifer Urquhart, vice 
president of marketing at New York-based Regency Cruises, which uses the canal 
frequently during its winter Caribbean schedule. "I am in touch with the State 
Department every hour." 
</P>
<P>
Yet even as the situation seemed to stabilize later in the day, many who once 
considered the Panama Canal a completely reliable route were shocked into 
considering new alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no real contingency plans because nobody really figured the canal 
would be shut," said Taub of Senator Lines.

FIRM CONTROLLED BY KKR NEARING BANKRUPTCY; 
</P>

Marking a new travail for top buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., 
Hillsborough Holdings said Wednesday that it may be forced into bankruptcy 
court if can't soon renegotiate its $624 million in junk bond debt. 
</P>
<P>
Hillsborough -- a building materials company called Jim Walter Corp. until it 
was bought by KKR two years ago for $2.4 billion -- said bondholders have been 
balking at a planned debt swap because of their nervousness over the junk 
market and a $3-billion asbestos-related suit pending against the company. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in July, contends that the KKR buyout was a conspiracy to avoid 
settlements with plaintiffs who sued a Hillsborough subsidiary for selling 
allegedly harmful asbestos. The suit worries the bondholders because they fear 
that it may prevent Hillsborough from selling assets to pay debts. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's nail-biting time," said Kevin McCabe, a senior analyst with R. D. 
Smith &amp; Co., a New York investment firm specializing in distressed 
securities. "The two sides are just trying to stare each other down." 
</P>
<P>
A filing for bankruptcy court reorganization would be a blow to the prestige of 
KKR, which, with investors, owns 92% of Tampa, Fla.-based Hillsborough. The 
buyout firm has recently suffered a spate of bad publicity during its struggles 
to restructure the debt of another KKR-controlled firm, Seaman Furniture, and 
the continuing financial difficulties of SCI Television, a partnership in which 
KKR owns a 46% stake. 
</P>
<P>
News of Hillsborough's difficulties contributed to a slide in junk bond prices, 
which lost one-quarter to one-half point in Wednesday's trading, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Hillsborough, which reported $1.4 billion in revenue for the fiscal year that 
ended in May, faces a Dec. 27 deadline for the debt renegotiation. Eighty 
percent of bondholders must agree for the deal to be consummated. 
</P>
<P>
Hillsborough's business operations are generally sound, analysts said, but the 
company took on a very heavy debt load in the buyout, arranged by KKR and the 
investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert. Among its businesses, Hillsborough 
manufactures iron pipes and aluminum and other building materials; it also 
mines coal and builds and finances homes. 
</P>
<P>
Several bondholders cited special reasons for skittishness. They said the 
Hillsborough bonds lack certain protective covenants that are often used to 
limit the ways that management can distribute cash to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
And they said the assets of a home-financing subsidiary, Mid-State, can't be 
used to service Hillsborough's debt. Because of that limitation, Hillsborough's 
balance sheet "doesn't look nearly so good," said one bondholder. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for KKR, Tom Daly, insisted that the buyout firm's problems have 
been overblown in publicity about the difficulties of SCI Television and 
Seaman. "The truth is, KKR is doing just fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he acknowledged that Hillsborough is much more important to 
KKR than are either Seaman or SCI Television. 
</P>
<P>
KKR took over Seaman, a New York furniture retailer, in a $360-million 
leveraged buyout two years ago. This year, with the Long Island economy slowing 
abruptly, Seaman was unable to raise enough money to pay creditors, and it 
faced possible bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
That was avoided last month when Seaman's creditors agreed to a renegotiation 
that gave the company's banks 47.5% of its stock and 8% for some bondholders, 
leaving 44.5% for KKR. 
</P>
<P>
SCI Television is the result of a highly leveraged, $1.2-billion buyout of six 
former Storer Communications stations in 1987. The chain, 54% owned by 
entrepreneur George Gillett, has suffered as the TV advertising market has 
cooled. Recently, the company has sought to restructure its debts as some 
bondholders have tried to force it into bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
A steering committee of bondholders has agreed in principle to a debt 
restructuring that would cut Gillett's stock holdings to 41%, and reduce KKR's 
to 15%, while giving 39% to bondholders and 5% to banks. Under the proposal, 
KKR would also forgive a $160-million note that it holds from SCI Television, 
and Gillett and KKR would give up leases on SCI property worth $42.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether a sufficient number of bondholders will agree to 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Some investors have predicted that these problems with KKR deals will make it 
harder for the firm to complete new buyouts and to line up investors who are 
willing to accept relatively higher risks for the promise of higher returns. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, KKR put together a $5.6-billion buyout fund that investors were told 
would produce annual returns in the mid-20% to the low-30% range over a six- to 
seven-year period. Daly, noting that KKR has yet to invest several billion 
dollars of this fund, said it was too early to predict whether the returns will 
fulfill expectations.

IT'S ALREADY 1992 FOR CARD COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

As the Christmas season -- the greeting card industry's biggest moneymaker -- 
approaches its climax, major retail card makers are busily planning for 
Valentine's Day, 1991, and Christmas, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"We normally work about 18 months to two years in advance of the holiday 
lines," said Barbara Miller, products spokeswoman for Hallmark Cards in Kansas 
City, Mo. She said planners are researching and planning 1991 Valentine's Day 
cards, which are second to Christmas cards in total sales and volume. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, 900 million sweetheart cards and 2.2 billion Christmas cards are 
exchanged in the United States, said Nancy Riviere, director of communications 
for the Greeting Card Assn. in Washington. She added that the card industry 
makes $4 billion in U.S. sales annually. 
</P>
<P>
American Greetings Corp., based in Cleveland, has already begun creative 
development for Christmas, 1992, said John A. Hernandis, director of corporate 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
"The activity doesn't parallel the event," Hernandis said. "Our work for this 
Christmas season ended many, many months ago." 
</P>
<P>
It takes months for the card makers to design, produce, write and finally 
distribute the cards. After assignments are given to artists, writers and 
editors, their proposals are checked by a review committee. Finally, after 
being printed, boxed and packaged, the cards are shipped to warehouses and 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Hallmark, the nation's largest card maker with about 44% of the market, will 
design about 2,000 different Valentine's Day cards for 1991, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Westen, manager of the Card Factory at the Beverly Center in Beverly 
Hills, said his store will not have to put away any unsold Christmas items to 
make room for the next major holiday, because this year's Christmas sales have 
been "wonderful. We have nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
Westen plans to display Valentine's Day cards beginning in mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
Easter and Mother's Day are the third- and fourth-largest card-selling 
holidays, with U.S. sales of 185 million and 145 million cards, respectively, 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday cards usually remain available for sale for four to six weeks.

Buyout of Unit Terminated, HCA Says: Hospital Corp. of America said it has 
terminated the planned sale of its HCA Psychiatric Co. to the unit's senior 
management and an employee stock ownership plan. Hospital Corp. said it was 
considering all alternatives concerning the unit but gave no reasons for not 
completing the deal. The Nashville, Tenn., firm, which went private in March, 
had planned to use the $1.23 billion from the sale to help pay off a 
$1.3-billion two-year loan it took out in connection with the buyout.

REVISED GNP FIGURES SHOW 3% GROWTH; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT SAYS AN IMPROVED TRADE PICTURE BOOSTED 
THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. economy grew at a revised 3% rate in the third quarter, stronger than 
previously estimated due to an improved trade picture, the Commerce Department 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The department, revising its growth estimate for the second and final time, had 
initially reported that third-quarter Gross National Product grew at a 2.5% 
rate. It then revised it to a 2.7% gain before pushing it up once again. 
</P>
<P>
The department said a cut in the nation's trade deficit accounted for the 
higher rate of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
The final GNP estimate exceeded expectations of a 2.7% rate of economic 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
But economists said the data offered little new information to shape their view 
of the economic landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of the underlying economy, the fourth quarter is going to be weak, 
but I don't think this report will have much impact on those numbers," said 
Bruce Steinberg at Merrill Lynch. "By now, most everything is known about the 
third quarter and this report is simply fine-tuning," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in GNP was supported by a downward revision in the trade deficit to 
$57.1 billion. This was $6.5 billion less than previously estimated but still 
higher than the second-quarter trade gap of $51.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Since the department's initial third-quarter GNP report in late October, the 
estimate of the trade deficit has been cut by $17 billion -- or a whopping 23% 
-- leading to the upward revision in growth. 
</P>
<P>
Despite stronger growth in the July to September period, economists said 
fourth-quarter growth has dropped dramatically and may actually contract after 
seven years of uninterrupted expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing employment has declined for the past several months, industrial 
production has dipped, residential building has fallen and consumer spending 
has declined. 
</P>
<P>
The sluggish economy also took a hit from Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco 
earthquake in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is forecasting a 2.7% growth rate for all of 1989, and 
the fourth-quarter GNP would have to advance 1.6% to meet that goal. The GNP 
grew by 3.7% in the first quarter and 2.5% in the second. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that we borrowed from the future to produce 3% growth and 
that source of strength is gone now," said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the 
Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
Sinai and others said much of the third-quarter growth resulted from robust 
earlier-than-normal sales of automobiles and light trucks that were driven by 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
But the incentives were dropped with the introduction of higher-priced 1990 
models in October and sales immediately slumped. Only this month have auto 
makers begun to restore rebates and lower interest rates that chief economist 
David Berson of the Federal National Mortgage Assn. said could boost sales 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
In another sign of slower economic growth, the department said business 
investment also eased, growing at a 5.2% annual rate in the third quarter 
compared to an 8.6% rate in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The implicit price deflator, a gauge of inflation that measures price changes 
in the GNP report, remained unchanged from the previous estimate of a 3.2% 
annual rate. 
</P>
<P>
The department revised down consumer spending to a 5.6% growth rate in the 
third quarter, compared to a previous estimate of 6.2%.

The stock market drifted through a trendless session Wednesday, registering no 
strong reaction to the U.S. military action in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.68 to 2,687.93, extending its 
loss over the past five trading days to 73.16. 
</P>
<P>
But advancing issues nosed out declines in nationwide trading of New York Stock 
Exchange-listed stocks, with 759 up, 749 down and 492 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume declined to 176.52 million shares, down from 186.06 million 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors were cautiously watching the situation in Panama, but 
apparently not viewing it as any cause to make big changes in their strategies. 
</P>
<P>
They noted that the prospective economic effects of the confrontation, if any, 
remain unclear. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, brokers said, stock traders appeared to draw only brief 
encouragement from an upward revision in the latest government figures on 
economic growth. 
</P>

Walt Disney tumbled 11 3/8 to 112 in selling attributed to recession worries

Stride Rite dropped 3 3/4 to 23 1/2 on word from the company that its earnings

Late in the day, however, an investor group said it proposed to buy Stride Rite 
for $32 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Helene Curtis Industries fell 3 5/8 to 25 3/4. The company reported earnings of 
28 cents a share for its quarter ended Nov. 30, down from 40 cents in the 1988

T-Bill Yields Drop; Bond Prices Mixed 
</P>
<P>
Treasury bill yields tumbled and bond prices were narrowly mixed after the 
Federal Reserve appeared to signal an easing of monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 3/32 point, or about 94 cents per 
$1,000 in face amount. Its yield increased to 7.84% from 7.83% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The military action in Panama had little effect on the credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices normally rise in times of instability as investors transfer money 
to safe long-term fixed investments such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York added reserves to the 
banking system. The action helped lower the federal funds rate, a key barometer 
of interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight 
loans, was quoted at about 8.25%, down from 8.50% late Tuesday.

</P>
<P>
Dollar Rises Early, but Reverses in U.S. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished mostly lower in foreign exchange trading in the United 
States after ending mixed overseas in what dealers called a muted response to 
the military action in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Gold investors appeared to discard news of the military action, as prices edged 
higher in New York after falling in Europe and Asia. Republic National Bank in 
New York quoted a late bid of $413.05, up $1.30. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar wound up lower against every major currency except the Japanese yen 
and Canadian dollar in New York. In Europe, it rose against the yen, Canadian 
dollar and Dutch guilder, but fell against other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers in Europe said the dollar rose early in the trading day in reaction to 
news of the U.S. military action in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
But the dollar reversed course midway through the U.S. trading day when the 
Federal Reserve took steps to inject reserves into the financial system, a move 
that was viewed as a sign that it may be encouraging lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Falling interest rates reduce demand for dollars because the decline cuts the 
yields available to foreigners on their dollar-denominated investments. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Levine, vice president for foreign exchange and precious metals at 
Elders Futures Inc. in New York, said trading was relatively light all day. 
</P>
<P>
The subsequent decline in the dollar also came on low volume, Levine said, 
because traders remember that they misinterpreted a similar move by the central 
bank a few weeks ago as an indication it was easing its credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 144.23 Japanese yen from 143.80 yen at Tuesday's 
close. Later in London, it was quoted at 143.90 yen. In New York, the dollar 
edged up to 143.93 yen from 143.65 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against the British pound. In London, the pound rose to $1.6052 
from $1.6005 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound rose to $1.6060 from $1.6010 
Tuesday.

Orange Juice Higher on Fear of a Freeze 
</P>
<P>
Prices of orange juice futures climbed higher on the New York Cotton Exchange 
as fears of a weekend freeze in Florida intensified. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, sugar futures fell sharply; coffee futures gained 
in reaction to the military action in Panama; precious metals advanced; energy 
futures were mixed; grains and soybeans fell, and livestock and meat futures 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
Futures prices for frozen concentrated orange juice settled 1.9 to 3.05 cents 
higher. The contract for delivery in January was up 2 cents at $1.3445 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Freezing temperatures are almost certain to reach Florida's citrus region this 
weekend as one of the most powerful cold-air masses of the decade lumbers down 
from Canada, said Jon Davis, a meteorologist who tracks the impact of the 
weather on commodities for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.

WILKINSON SELLS NON-EUROPEAN SHARE OF FIRM

Gillette Co. said Wednesday that it agreed to buy the Wilkinson razor and blade 
business outside the 12-country European Community from British-based Wilkinson 
Sword Group Ltd. for $72 million. 
</P>
<P>
Gillette is also acquiring a 22.9% non-voting stake in a new, still unnamed 
company, which is likely to be incorporated in the Netherlands. The company is 
buying the Wilkinson lines in the EC. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the EC part of the deal will not add directly to the Gillette 
bottom line, but will allow the company to get a share of some of the profits. 
</P>
<P>
They also said the EC arrangement ends hopes for its major competitors, 
including Bic of France, to acquire that market share for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Lee Landry, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said the purchases 
represent a "great investment" for Gillette, which will add about $6 million a 
year in operating profits. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest benefit for Gillette taking part in these transactions is the fact 
that Bic is not taking part," said Jay Freedman, an analyst with Kidder, 
Peabody &amp; Co. "It is relatively small but it eliminates a competitor." 
</P>
<P>
The American grooming products giant, which already controls about 60% of the 
world shaving goods market, said it is investing $155 million in equity 
investment and lending in the deals. 
</P>
<P>
The previous owner of the Wilkinson line, Stora of Sweden and its Swedish-based 
Match subsidiary, is selling all its disposable lighter, match and razor and 
blade businesses worldwide to the new company of which Gillette is a part owner 
in a deal worth about $600 million, Gillette said. 
</P>
<P>
A "significant part" of the transaction was completed Wednesday and the rest is 
expected in early 1990, Gillette said. 
</P>
<P>
Gillette will pay $14 million for its share in the new company. Also, Gillete 
agreed to lend the company $69 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson controls about 2% of the U.S. blade and razor business compared to 
63% for Gillette. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the European Community, Wilkinson sales amounted to $30 million in 
1988, with substantial market shares in non-EC members, including Austria, 
Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil. Also, Wilkinson's manufacturing plants in 
Brazil and Zimbabwe are included in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
A New York-based bank, J. P. Morgan &amp; Co., owns 24.9% of the equity in the 
newly formed company and is the lender for all of the nearly $400 million in 
senior debt needed for the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other investors in the Dutch company are Sweden's SPP Skandia 
Insurance Co.; Spira Invest AB; Procuritas MBO Invest AB, and Kjobenhavns 
Handelsbank, a Danish bank.

The new owner of Ms. said Wednesday he plans to resume publication of the 
magazine every other month starting next spring and named feminist activist and 
author Robin Morgan as its editor in chief. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine, founded in 1972, had been a monthly but was not profitable and 
had often been at odds with advertisers over its editorial content. 
</P>
<P>
Dale W. Lang, whose Lang Communications Inc. assumed control of Ms. in 
mid-October, had previously disclosed that when the magazine resumed 
publication, it would no longer accept advertising. Lang had said publishing 
the magazine without ads would relieve it from "external pressures" and enable 
its editorial staff to concentrate on pursuing issues important to women 
without concerns about advertiser backlash. 
</P>
<P>
The last issue of Ms. magazine was dated November. No specific date was set for 
resumption of publication as a bimonthly. 
</P>
<P>
Lang was unavailable for comment on the latest decisions, but a spokeswoman 
said that subscribers would soon be getting a letter of explanation from Gloria 
Steinem, a co-founder of the magazine who remains a consultant.

Redoubt Volcano took a breather from its explosive eruptions, prompting a mad 
rush by airlines to get stranded holiday travelers to their destinations, but 
the still-trembling mountain forced the evacuation and shutdown of an oil 
facility. The Drift River oil storage site, which handles crude oil production 
from Cook Inlet and pumps oil onto tankers bound for the West Coast, was shut 
down. Scientists said seismic monitors showed continued rumblings deep inside 
the volcano, located 110 miles southwest of Anchorage. There was evidence that 
molten material was boiling inside the mountain and could explode out of the 
summit crater.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided it will not try to use explosives to 
break up a huge ice jam on the Mississippi River, which has been virtually 
closed to barge traffic. Corps officials met in St. Louis with officials of the 
U.S. Coast Guard and representatives of the barge industry. Lt. Cmdr. Myles 
Boothe of the Coast Guard said there would be no attempt to blast now because 
the ice cover is not posing an immediate threat. Wednesday marked the third day 
that a 203-mile stretch of the river from St. Louis to Cairo, Ill., was all but 
closed because of ice and low water.

Franklin County officials are denying that the animals, which were supposed to 
have been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning, were alive when buried.

State election officials have cleared the way for Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach), to run for a coveted state Senate seat in a special 
election. Striking a compromise between warring Republican candidates, Gov. 
George Deukmejian set Feb. 6 for the primary election and April 10 for the 
general election to replace state Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) 
who resigned Friday. Ferguson was assured a spot in the primary when election 
officials ruled that he had narrowly met a 30-day residency requirement when he 
moved to Laguna Beach last month to be eligible to run. The announcement sets 
the stage for a brief and intense seven-week Republican primary battle among 
Ferguson, Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), and Brea Councilman Ron Isles in 
a sprawling, strongly Republican district that runs from Laguna Beach north 
into southern Los Angeles County.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RELIGIOUS LEADERS URGE COUNCIL TO OK ETHICS 
PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A coalition of religious leaders, concerned that a proposed city government 
ethics package may be gutted, called Wednesday on the Los Angeles City Council 
to accept the plan in its entirety and vowed to present it to voters if the 
council fails to heed their advice. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 religious leaders were introduced at a news conference by Mayor Tom 
Bradley, who said they had requested a forum to make their appeal. Bradley, 
whose acceptance of payments from two financial institutions in exchange for 
serving as an adviser or director helped spawn the proposals, then left without 
accepting questions. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics package, if approved, not only would outlaw the financial 
transactions that drew Bradley into controversy, but would also prevent the 
earning of outside income, all gifts and honorariums, and would order the 
public financing of city political campaigns. An ethics commission would 
monitor the behavior of city officials.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COOLER WEATHER HELPS KEEP THE LID ON MEDFLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No Mediterranean fruit flies were found in the Los Angeles area for the fifth 
consecutive day Wednesday, but the trend will have to last at least two more 
weeks before officials declare a breakthrough in the battle against the pest. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Edwards, the county's chief deputy agricultural commissioner, said cooler 
temperatures were partly responsible for the dormant Medfly population. The 
last of the 228 crop-threatening Medflies found in the county since July was a 
pregnant fly discovered Friday in previously uninfested Compton, which will be 
included in the South Gate malathion spraying zone that will be treated Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
A 26-square-mile-area encompassing South Pasadena and parts of Alhambra, El 
Sereno, Monterey Hills, Pasadena and San Marino was to be sprayed Wednesday 
night. A 38-square-mile-area of South Gate and Norwalk is scheduled to be 
sprayed tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The spraying will then be suspended until after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County will conduct aerial spraying of malathion tonight from 9 
p.m. to 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Area: 38 square miles encompassing Bellflower, Cudahy, South Gate and parts of 
Bell, Cerritos, Huntington Park, Lakewood, Long Beach, Lynwood, Maywood, 
Norwalk, Paramount and Walnut Park. 
</P>
<P>
Precautions: Stay indoors; keep animals indoors; wash animal dishes and toys 
left outside; cover cars; keep doors and windows closed. 
</P>

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVE-THROUGH FAST-FOOD EATERY IN HIGH-RISE 
OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A popular McDonald's restaurant in Glendale will succumb to bulldozers next 
month to make way for a bigger McDonald's to be built as the world's first 
drive-through, fast-food restaurant in a high-rise building. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Redevelopment Agency has granted final approval to the 
Howard-Platz Group of Glendale to build a $30-million, nine-story office 
building and theater complex at 500 N. Central Ave., the site of one of the 
most successful franchises in the fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
A new restaurant, with a drive-through lane big enough for 20 or more cars to 
wait, will be built on the ground floor of the office building, expected to be 
completed in late spring of 1991, city officials said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN HURT, PET PYTHON KILLED IN APARTMENT 
FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fire that possibly started in a Christmas tree swept through a Long Beach 
apartment, critically injuring a sleeping resident and killing one of her two 
pet pythons, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Lee, 24, was in critical but stable condition at Long Beach Memorial 
Hospital with second- and third-degree burns over 30% of her arms and torso, 
Fire Department spokesman Bob Caldon said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, who was asleep when the fire broke out about 11:25 p.m. Tuesday, also 
suffered a deep cut on her left arm when she jumped out a window to escape the 
flames, Caldon said. 
</P>
<P>
Caldon said the fire probably started accidentally, possibly in the Christmas 
tree. Firefighters rescued one of the two pet pythons, taking it to a local 
animal shelter for treatment of injuries. A second snake died.

RTD MAY GIVE IN TO SHARED SUBWAY ROLE; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: BOARD WILL MEET TODAY TO RECONSIDER A CONSTRUCTION PEACE PLAN OFFERED 
BY THE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission has taken control of the Metro 
Rail construction project, but there are still signs that the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District may attempt to salvage some role for itself 
in building the subway. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the sharply divided RTD Board of Directors -- apparently having 
had second thoughts about their recent actions -- has scheduled a special 
meeting today to reconsider a peace proposal offered by the commission but 
rejected by the board last week. 
</P>
<P>
The two big transit agencies have long been at odds over which one will 
complete the 17.2-mile subway. The RTD initiated the project, but changes in 
the law have since put the commission in control of the construction purse 
strings. 
</P>
<P>
If the RTD board does reverse itself and accept the peace offer, it would be 
agreeing to share its authority over rail construction with the commission in 
return for being allowed to continue as the project builder. 
</P>
<P>
The district is now tunneling the first 4.4 miles of the subway line that one 
day is to link downtown Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley. In addition, 
the RTD has contracted with the commission to build the 6.8-mile second phase 
of the project, extending the line from MacArthur Park to Hollywood Boulevard 
and Vine Street. And it has been assumed that the RTD would undertake building 
the final six miles into North Hollywood sometime in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
But in the current dispute, RTD's construction role in the second and third 
phases of the project is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The $3.7-billion project is funded jointly with local, state and federal money. 
The commission, which oversees transit rail construction in the county, must 
approve all future Metro Rail funding. A commission audit last summer revealed 
that Metro Rail's first phase is over-budget and two years behind schedule. The 
commission and the city of Los Angeles must pick up the tab for any cost 
overruns. 
</P>
<P>
To hold costs down, commission officials set up a subsidiary nonprofit agency 
called the Rail Construction Corp. to take over building Metro Rail and all 
other rail construction in the county. The RTD was offered three of six seats 
on the new construction firm's board of directors. That is the offer the RTD 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"We have given blood, sweat and tears to this project and now somebody else is 
trying to come in and take all the glory," RTD Board President Gordana Swanson 
said when the offer was made. "But," she added, "we are just not going to give 
up." 
</P>
<P>
After some intense behind-the-scenes negotiating, a compromise was proposed by 
RTD Director Nick Patsaouras to settle the dispute. The "Patsaouras Compromise" 
proposed that the rail construction firm's board have a seventh, tie-breaking 
member so that neither agency could dominate its actions. The six board members 
would be allowed to choose the seventh, independent vote. 
</P>
<P>
That compromise has been rejected twice within the last month by the RTD board, 
6 to 5. After the most recent vote last week, a series of amendments were added 
to the Patsaouras proposal by Swanson and her supporters in an effort to 
re-establish the RTD as Metro Rail's prime builder. These were approved by a 
bare board majority, but proved unacceptable to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Acting swiftly in response, the commission staff canceled the $19.7-million 
contract it had signed with the RTD for design of Metro Rail's next phase. 
</P>
<P>
This action signaled the commission's takeover of the final 12.8 miles of Metro 
Rail. Because the RTD had signed the original funding agreement with the 
federal government for the project's first leg, the district will complete that 
work, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Patsaouras worked to revive his compromise. He said he was 
successful in getting at least one director, Kenneth R. Thomas, to reconsider 
his position and agree to call a special meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
Patsaouras is hopeful the meeting will result in a 6-5 vote accepting his 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Thomas, Swanson said, "It appears one member on the prevailing 
side is reconsidering." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, clearly unhappy about having to schedule the special meeting, still 
opposes the idea of the RTD sharing power with the commission through the Rail 
Construction Corp. She also wants more restraints placed on the commission's 
authority over Metro Rail. 
</P>
<P>
If the RTD board does not reverse course and if the commission takeover goes 
ahead, Swanson indicated the dispute between the two transit agencies may wind 
up in court or the state Legislature. Either step would likely hold up federal 
funding on the project.

SANTA OFFERS PRESENTS TO AID CAUSE OF JANITORS; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: HIS VISITS TO L.A. OFFICE COMPLEXES TURN OUT TO BE A CAMPAIGN TO 
PRESSURE CLEANING FIRMS INTO RECOGNIZING UNION. 
</P>

<P>
Arlene Kahn was on the phone at the reception desk of Century Towers Plaza, 
which manages two Century City office buildings, when Santa Claus strolled in 
Wednesday, followed by several friends and small children. 
</P>
<P>
Delighted, Kahn told her caller that she had to get off the phone because Santa 
was there. She greeted him effusively. 
</P>
<P>
Only when Santa began to speak did Kahn's smile freeze. She was, she realized 
with dismay, being ambushed. 
</P>
<P>
Santa explained he was there because Century Towers had been, in his mind, a 
naughty company. 
</P>
<P>
Santa -- who turned out to be Jono Shaffer, an organizer for Local 399 of the 
Service Employees International Union -- said he had heard that Century Towers' 
janitors were being exposed to health hazards when they used strong chemicals 
to clean bathrooms and other areas and that their requests for protective 
gloves had been denied. 
</P>
<P>
He then reached into his red sack and offered Kahn a "present": half a dozen 
pairs of yellow rubber gloves, each tagged with the logo of the union's 
"Justice for Janitors" campaign, a 4-year-old national effort to unionize 
janitors. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa," Kahn said sternly, "I think you're talking with the wrong people." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of demurrer is the root of a prolonged war between the managers of 
Los Angeles office buildings and Local 399. 
</P>
<P>
Large office buildings routinely contract with large cleaning companies. Many 
of the companies regard unions as troublesome and expensive and have fought off 
union organizing drives. 
</P>
<P>
Office complex managers contend that disputes over treatment of janitors are 
out of their hands and instead are the responsibility of the cleaning 
companies. In response, the Justice for Janitors campaign has staged numerous 
demonstrations at major Los Angeles office complexes, contending that the 
complexes have a social responsibility to pressure their cleaning companies to 
recognize the union. 
</P>
<P>
As the result of a steady shift by office complexes to non-union cleaning 
companies, a typical janitor's hourly wage in Los Angeles dropped from $7.07 in 
1983 to $4.50 last year, according to a study done for the union by a UCLA 
graduate student in economics. This has allowed downtown office complexes to 
cut in half the percentage of rental income that goes to janitors wages, the 
study said. 
</P>
<P>
Local 399 has been able to win representation for about half of the 1,500 
janitors who work for cleaning companies that contract with major downtown 
office towers, usually obtaining $1-an-hour raises to $5 or $5.50 an hour, as 
well as overtime and health benefits. In Century City, however, the union has 
yet to unionize any janitors. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why Santa Claus came to the pricey environs of Century Park East on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer, followed by a half a dozen janitors and an equal number of their 
children, marched gleefully into several Century City buildings to present 
packages of gloves and issue a plea to surprised receptionists or building 
managers "that you treat your janitors with respect." 
</P>
<P>
Union organizers said that while unionized janitors are routinely issued gloves 
to protect their hands, the cleaning company used by Century Towers Plaza -- 
International Service Systems -- has refused to do so, despite persistent 
requests by workers. 
</P>
<P>
Shaffer said International Service Systems, which he said has 10 office 
building cleaning contracts in Century City, agreed to give gloves to workers 
in one of Century Towers Plaza's buildings a week ago but only after workers 
had filed a complaint with Cal/OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
A Cal/OSHA official confirmed the complaint and said an inspection of the 
building is ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
"We use very strong liquids, and they really hurt our hands," said Juana Lopez, 
a 28-year-old janitor who works in another Century City office building 
serviced by International Service Systems. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles office of the New York-based cleaning 
company, which employs 14,000 people throughout the United States, declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Factor, the industrial hygienist for the AFL-CIO's department of 
occupational safety and health, said in an interview that gloves for janitors 
"is the minimal thing the employer should be doing. . . . Some of that (liquid 
cleaning) stuff is definitely in the toxic category." 
</P>
<P>
Such points of view were dealt with only briefly when Santa met Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
After refusing to accept the gloves, Kahn got on the phone and called a 
security guard. Once he arrived, she asked Santa and his minions to leave the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Santa was nonplussed. He mused that "it was the first time I've ever had a 
Christmas present turned down." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, he still had several other office buildings left on his route.

KIROV DEBUT FOR REV. MOON'S PRIMA BALLERINA; 
</P>
<P>
BALLET: RELIGIOUS LEADER SAYS HIS DAUGHTER-IN-LAW'S PERFORMANCE IN 'GISELLE' IN 
LENINGRAD WILL BE AN 'IMPORTANT MOMENT' IN HIS RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIETS.

<P>
The daughter-in-law of vehement anti-communist South Korean religious leader 
Sun Myung Moon is scheduled to make her debut Friday night in Leningrad with 
the famed Kirov Ballet company. The performance may represent the most visible 
effort to date by the Rev. Moon and his Unification Church to use the 
international dance community to extend his religious and political influence. 
</P>
<P>
Moon's interest in the arts goes back at least two decades, but Friday's 
scheduled performance by Korean-American Julia Hoon Sook Moon promises to be a 
major turning point in the artistic and political fortunes of the controversial 
religious leader, his church and the dancer herself. 
</P>
<P>
Moon, who plans to attend his daughter-in-law's performances on Friday and 
Sunday, has called the event an "important moment" in his personal quest to 
improve relations with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Moon and the church are taking other steps in this direction: 
</P>
<P>
* Officials of the Unification Church have directed the unheralded career of 
Julia Moon. They have paid some of the world's top dancers to coach and perform 
with her since 1984, when she was chosen to marry Moon's dead son, who, 
according to church doctrine, could not enter heaven unmarried. 
</P>
<P>
* Within months of the marriage, Moon founded the Universal Ballet Company in 
Seoul, where his daughter-in-law is now principal ballerina. 
</P>
<P>
* Two years ago, Moon and Julia Moon's father, Bo Hi Pak, a longtime friend and 
top aide to the religious leader, established the Universal Ballet Foundation 
in Washington. From its complex in Washington, the foundation functions as a 
kind of central casting office for the Seoul dance company, and there are plans 
to establish a ballet school. 
</P>
<P>
* Moon and Pak are renovating the Manhattan Center Opera House in New York as a 
theater for future performances of the Universal Ballet Company. 
</P>
<P>
* And, along with the Universal Ballet in Seoul, Pak and Moon run the Little 
Angels Children's Folk Ballet, which was also founded by Moon more than 30 
years ago. The group began touring the United States in the early 1960s, and 
Pak used its performances to make contacts with influential Americans such as 
former President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
Relatively little is known about the internal operations of Moon's dance 
interests in Korea, the United States and, now, the Soviet Union. It is also 
unclear exactly how the various dance pursuits fit within Moon's broader 
political and religious goals of establishing a worldwide, unified church and 
state with himself as its spiritual and governmental head. 
</P>
<P>
But a congressional subcommittee that investigated the Korean influence-buying 
scandal of the mid-1970s concluded that "Moon made it clear that the Little 
Angels (Children's Folk Ballet) . . . and other seemingly philanthropic 
projects were, in reality, geared to his ambitious and carefully thought-out 
plans for winning control and influence over other political and secular 
institutions." 
</P>
<P>
And now, with Julia Moon and the Kirov, Moon is looking beyond his traditional 
North American and Asian bases of influence to the newly opening Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
To announce Julia Moon's debut a group called the World Media Assn. took out a 
full-page ad in the Dec. 3 New York Times featuring a picture of Moon and a 
recent question-answer interview that he gave to a Soviet journalist. Moon 
called the performance a landmark in his daughter-in-law's career and "an 
important moment in the development of my personal contact with the Soviet 
Union." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to assure the people of the Soviet Union that Rev. Moon is your 
friend," he said. "My movement in 130 countries is your friend as well." 
</P>
<P>
Julia Moon, 24, virtually unknown outside a narrow circle within the dance 
world, is scheduled to make her Kirov debut Friday in "Giselle," which is to 
ballet what "Hamlet" is to theater. She's unknown to Andris Liepa, the Bolshoi 
Ballet star who will dance opposite her as a Kirov guest. She's unknown to 
Kirov artistic director Oleg Vinogradov, who invited her to perform without 
ever meeting her. 
</P>
<P>
And she's unknown to her husband, already dead when the Rev. Moon performed the 
marriage ceremony in 1984 with the ballerina and his son, who had been killed 
at age 17 in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
Until the announcement of her Kirov debut, few had ever heard the name Julia 
Hoon Sook Pak Moon -- except those who have coached and partnered her. But the 
dancer -- American in speech and manner and reserved to the point of shyness, 
according to those who have worked with her -- has since childhood quietly 
dedicated herself to the study of ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Julia Moon grew up largely in MacLean, Va., just outside Washington. It is 
there and in New York that her father oversees affairs of the Unification 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
She began her ballet training in Korea at the Sun Hwa Art School, then in 
London at the Royal Ballet School. She went to Monaco to learn from the Russian 
teacher Marika Besobrasova, then became a company member at the Washington 
Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
She has been partnered by such internationally known danseurs as Fernando 
Bujones, Kevin McKenzie, Ross Stretton, the late Patrick Bissell and Gregory 
Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
Osborne spoke positively about Moon, mentioning "her serene quality." He said 
that he danced "Giselle" with her and that her "best moments come in the second 
act." 
</P>
<P>
Julia Moon would not be interviewed, despite repeated requests. But talks with 
those who have worked and performed with her indicate that five years ago 
everything in her life and career changed. 
</P>
<P>
"The company was on an Asian tour," recalled Mary Day, who had accepted her 
into the Washington Ballet two years earlier in 1982. "Hoon Sook received a 
phone call from Korea, summoning her there for a family emergency . . . to 
marry Rev. Moon's 17-year-old son . . . who had just been killed in an auto 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
"We were nonplussed at what happened," said Day, recounting the church tenets 
as explained to her by the new bride: one must be married to ascend to heaven. 
"Hoon Sook returned to us briefly, and then left again for Korea." 
</P>
<P>
"Julia is very modest," said Roy Tobias by phone from Seoul, where he serves as 
Universal Ballet's artistic director, "and lacks confidence in herself. The 
Kirov invitation, though, is just part of a whole series of exchanges that her 
father, Dr. Pak, is trying to negotiate now. If all goes as planned, we'll be 
having members of the Kirov as guest artists in February." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, according to Pak's spokeswoman Caroline Betancourt, Pak sent a 
video of his daughter's dancing to Vinogradov when the Kirov played in New 
York. The Kirov director visited Seoul last October, and the two met for the 
first time and finalized plans for the Kirov's Korean tour in 1991. Vinogradov 
also approved Julia Moon's appearance as a guest dancer in Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
It was in New York last summer that Liepa, Moon's partner-to-be at the Kirov, 
met Vinogradov. "We discussed my coming to Leningrad," Liepa said by phone from 
Moscow, where his mother lives. "When he asked if I would like to do 'Giselle' 
with a Korean ballerina, I agreed." 
</P>
<P>
The blond dancer, son of the late Maris Liepa, is under contract with American 
Ballet Theatre. He said he still has not met Moon but "was told (by those at 
ABT who knew her) that she is a very nice person and a beautiful girl." 
</P>
<P>
Skeptical observers in the dance world find the prospect of Julia Moon dancing 
at the Kirov bizarre, especially in this major role. 
</P>
<P>
"Completely mystifying," said Georgina Parkinson, ABT ballet mistress, who had 
been hired in 1986 to coach Moon and others at the Universal Ballet Company in 
Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"I went there many times and simply cannot imagine how this whole thing came 
about. Julia is lovely, positively lovely. She's had the benefit of everything 
money could buy, in the way of training. But I don't think she could ever 
become a dancer for the world market." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does ballet mistress Gloria Fokine, who was also employed by the small 
troupe and paid $20,000 for three months' work. "In any major company she would 
be a member of the corps de ballet," said the Cuban-born niece of choreographer 
Michel Fokine. "Maybe prima ballerina in (the boondocks of) Vladivostok. Her 
line is OK, but she doesn't have a strong technique and leaves a lot to be 
desired in the acting department." 
</P>
<P>
Parkinson, who has also staged "Les Sylphides" in Seoul ("for a very nice fee") 
is among several others imported from ABT to enhance Universal Ballet. In fact, 
most of Moon's stellar partners listed in her biography appeared with the 
Universal Ballet Company. None would reveal fees but Parkinson said that "it 
takes big bait to go all the way to Korea." 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are agog at the physical beauty (of the Universal Ballet's 
facility)," Fokine said. "The theater itself is fabulous -- a fortune must have 
gone into it. In fact, the whole complex -- which includes several school 
buildings (for art, music and dance integrated with academics) and lush gardens 
is quite something. All that white marble, it's dazzling." 
</P>
<P>
Fokine was disturbed, however, by the atmosphere at the Seoul facility -- 
which, to her, reflected the cult nature long ascribed to Moon's Unification 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
She did not accept further teaching offers in Seoul "because it was just too 
scary, and I'm talking about a mind-control cult . . . where brainwashing is 
accomplished through a regimen of little sleep and skimpy diets. Before each 
performance someone at the loudspeaker calls the company to prayer. They all 
congregate, hold hands and pray." 
</P>
<P>
Except for the outsiders, Fokine said that most of the teachers are "Moonies." 
</P>
<P>
Moon encourages his followers to call him "Father" and heed his directives "no 
matter what." Fokine also said that "most of this is kept quiet to the point of 
denial. They've even taken the Rev. Moon's name out of the program." 
</P>
<P>
The church rejects its reputation as a cult. But currently the Supreme Court is 
hearing a damages trial against the Unification Church for allegedly having 
used trickery and brainwashing to recruit two young members. 
</P>
<P>
The church has amassed great wealth through double tithing of its members and 
enormous profits from its real estate and media holdings -- the Pak-overseen 
News World Communications, a holding company that owns the Washington Times, 
Noticias del Mundo (which was sold in Los Angeles) and other newspapers. In 
1985, the French newspaper Le Monde estimated the church's worldwide annual 
profits at about $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
The church has a worldwide membership of 2 million to 3 million and a budget 
estimated by church officials at between $50 million and $100 million in the 
United States. Church officials say there are 55,000 members in the States. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Moon served an 11-month prison sentence in the United States for 
income tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Moon nor Pak was available for comment to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't seem to locate any of them," said Caroline Betancourt, their public 
relations officer at Universal Artists Management. And they are elusive through 
other channels. A secretary in Pak's New York office said she "has worked here 
for four months without ever seeing or speaking on the phone to him." 
</P>
<P>
One who did comment on the relationship between the church and the dance 
academy was Jeffrey Benson, spokesman for the Universal Ballet Foundation. He 
denied any connection. "No church doctrines are taught here," he said. "We are 
not affiliated. Our only goal is to train dancers for the highest artistic 
attainment."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: A VIEW FROM THE HOTEL: REPORTING THE PANAMA CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
ABC's Peter Jennings called it "hotel reporting." 
</P>
<P>
We got it from China last June when many Western journalists, their freedom of 
movement severely restricted in Beijing, were forced to observe the crackdown 
of pro-reform dissidents from their hotel rooms overlooking Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
And now, as Jennings noted Wednesday morning, it was happening again. 
</P>
<P>
Just as journalists were trapped in their hotels during some of the violence in 
China, so were many initially forced to report by phone from their rooms in the 
besieged Marriott Hotel during the first hours of the upheaval in Panama as 
U.S. forces moved against Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it was NBC's Ed Rabel, CBS' Juan Vasquez or ABC's Juan Quinones (who at 
one point reported hiding under his bed with his producer), these limited, but 
unique eyewitness accounts were, in effect, radio on television. 
</P>
<P>
Although some journalists may have been able to leave the hotel Tuesday night, 
many stayed, fearing they'd be in even greater danger on the streets. But 
tension was also high inside the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from his room by phone to Dan Rather several times late Tuesday night, 
Vasquez obviously felt in peril. His speech was halting and barely above a 
whisper, and he seemed to want to get off the phone as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
For emotion, however, nothing topped New York Times reporter Lindsey Gruson on 
the phone with Rather, his voice full of emotion as he described having a gun 
put to his head, and then to his teeth by threatening Panamanians who had taken 
him from his hotel room and held him hostage part of Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the hotel "reporters" were professional journalists. 
</P>
<P>
On the line with NBC Wednesday morning and sounding very scared was Roger 
Sizemore, who was identified as a California businessman. He spoke from his 
room at the Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
Sizemore asked Tom Brokaw and Bryant Gumbel if they knew if it was safe for him 
to go to the lobby. It was amazing -- an American in Panama asking Americans in 
New York for information about Panama that could determine his fate. Gumbel 
told him that NBC reporter Rabel was able to leave the hotel safely Wednesday 
morning, but that he couldn't say if Sizemore should try to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Then Gumbel asked Sizemore if it was safe for him to go to the window and look 
out. "I'd rather not," he said. He didn't have to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Twice Sizemore left the phone to respond to what he said was "someone at the 
door." After the second time, he returned and said abruptly: "We gotta go." Go 
where? And why? There was no more information, for the conversation had ended. 
</P>
<P>
United States television is available in some Panama hotels, and NBC's John 
Chancellor noted the strange irony: People trapped in their hotels in Panama 
were complaining about that to U.S. networks who possibly were being watched by 
the very Panamanians who were responsible for those people being trapped. 
</P>
<P>
Although other news organizations also complained that the hotel was 
unprotected, it was NBC that seemed almost to be making the Marriott its cause 
Wednesday morning. Gumbel and his soon-to-be "Today" co-host Deborah Norville 
repeatedly asked why the hotel hadn't been secured by the invading U.S. troops, 
given the number of Americans known to be staying there. 
</P>
<P>
However, there were surely many other hotels in Panama housing Americans, and 
they probably were in danger, too. Hence the Marriott was singled out for 
special emphasis on TV, it seemed, only because so many of the American media 
were staying there. That put it under the TV spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time we do get some protection," ABC reporter Quinones said 
Wednesday morning. His frustration was understandable. Yet it seemed that 
through television, pressure was being put on U.S. forces to come to the rescue 
of a specific hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Media first, others second?

OVERKILL: Another view came from Sister Carmen Serati, a Catholic nun in Santa 
Ana with relatives in Panama. . . . She called Bush's action a lopsided attempt 
at United States intervention based on improper intelligence about the location 
of Manuel A. Noriega. "I think they went after a mosquito with a cannon," she 
said. "And the mosquito, they found, is in the other house." Dana Parsons and

MEDICARE DEATH RATES: 72 FACILITIES EXCEED PREDICTIONS

More than 70 California hospitals, including Humana Hospital-Westminster, had 
significantly higher than predicted death rates for Medicare patients between 
1986 and 1988, and 28 had rates significantly lower than predicted, according 
to an analysis of the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration's third annual 
report on mortality among Medicare patients at the nation's hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Also among the 72 California hospitals with higher than predicted rates were 
California Medical Center and Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Los 
Angeles, Valley Hospital Medical Center in Van Nuys and two Kaiser Foundation 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Those with lower than predicted mortality rates included City of Hope National 
Medical Center in Duarte, Green Hospital of Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, seven 
Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and UCLA Medical 
Center in Los Angeles and UC San Francisco Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The HCFA report was made public Wednesday. The analysis of the report was 
prepared by Michael Pine &amp; Associates Inc., a Chicago health care 
consulting firm that was a consultant to HCFA in preparing its report. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Pine, the president of the firm, made available to The Times a list 
of the California hospitals with the highest and lowest overall mortality rates 
for Medicare patients for the three-year period, as compared to their predicted 
death rates. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics reflect the percentage of a hospital's Medicare patients who 
died within 30 days of being admitted to the hospital, whether as hospital 
patients or after discharge, as compared to its predicted percentage. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital's predicted mortality rate takes into account patient 
characteristics such as age, sex, chronic diseases and previous 
hospitalizations to assess their relative risk of dying there. 
</P>
<P>
The mortality information "is not a direct measure of the quality of care, but 
it is a valuable tool to identify potential problems for review and action by 
hospital administrators and medical staff," said Louis B. Hays, HCFA acting 
administrator. Hays said consumers should "consult their physicians when 
evaluating the report on a particular hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals should "begin to incorporate not only this data but also statistical 
techniques in day-to-day quality improvement activities," Pine said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Humana Hospital-Westminster Wednesday expressed disappointment 
with the conclusions of the analysis and defended the hospital's patient care. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are doing everything that can possibly be done in the area of 
quality assurance and morbidity and mortality," said Executive Director Joel 
Premselaar. "We have evaluated every Medicare death and have found no unusual 
circumstances other than the fact that the patients are very elderly and have 
multiple illnesses." 
</P>
<P>
The Westminster hospital was among 32 nationwide to exceed predicted death 
rates for three straight years -- 1986, 1987 and 1988 -- according to the HCFA 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Premselaar said the statistics are in part a reflection of the hospital's 
high-risk patient population. Of the patients admitted to the hospital in 1988, 
for example, he said, 50% were admitted to the intensive care unit. 
Seventy-four percent of those who died at the hospital that year were admitted 
through the emergency room, and 62% of those who died were admitted in such a 
condition that their families and physicians had decided to avoid heroic 
efforts to save them. 
</P>
<P>
Premselaar also disputed the accuracy of some of the data on which the HCFA 
conclusions are based. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital treated about 1,300 Medicare patients last year, many more than 
the 789 the HCFA study identifies, he said. One death the HCFA reports occurred 
at Humana actually occurred at a Veterans Adminstration hospital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Premselaar's defense of care at the hospital was backed up by a recent survey 
of the facility, state health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Humana Westminster was one of 50 hospitals nationwide that, because it had 
higher than expected death rates for two years in a row, the HFCA recommended 
undergo more detailed evaluation this year by state health agencies. A team 
composed of representatives from the state Health Services Department and the 
California Medical Assn. conducted a review of the facility in May and found no 
major code deficiencies, said Jacqueline Lincer, district administrator of the 
Health Services Department licensing and certification division in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a full inspection of Humana Westminster, and with the exception of 
some fire safety code deficiencies, we did not identify anything that would 
lead to termination of (Medicare) funding," Lincer said. 
</P>
<P>
Premselaar said that all of the code violations are being corrected. 
</P>
<P>
The HCFA statistics released Wednesday allow a hospital's actual performance to 
be compared to its expected performance; they are not intended to be used to 
make comparisons between institutions. In addition to overall death rates, the 
HCFA report includes data on common causes of death in the elderly such as 
heart disease and strokes. 
</P>
<P>
HCFA also released the results of studies that it said demonstrate the value of 
the report as an indicator of the quality of medical care. 
</P>
<P>
For example, HCFA said that hospitals with high mortality rates are more likely 
to have quality problems identified after detailed case-by case reviews than 
hospitals with lower ones. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, hospitals with low mortality rates are more likely to have 
favorable characteristics, according to a report by Medical College of 
Wisconsin and HCFA researchers published in today's New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the average hospital, these favorable characteristics include a 
higher percentage of physicians who are board certified specialists, a higher 
percentage of registered nurses, higher occupancy rates, and better 
availability of high-technology equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But the researchers caution that these findings, which are based on "patterns 
of performance in a large number of hospitals," do not imply that a detailed 
review of a specific hospital with a high mortality rate will find quality 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
As in previous years, hospital associations downplayed the significance of 
HCFA's data and consumer groups applauded its release. 
</P>
<P>
"The mortality data only tells you a very little bit about the quality of care 
that is delivered," said Carol McCarthy, president of the Chicago-based 
American Hospital Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Health Research Group in Washington, 
said the federal government is "clearly moving in the right direction" but 
should continue to improve the annual reports by including data on individual 
surgeries and medical illnesses and on individual physicians. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-volume report is based on a computerized analysis of about 10.5 million 
Medicare admissions at nearly 6,000 acute-care hospitals during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 report is similar to the two previous reports, although HCFA said the 
statistical methods have been "refined and improved." For example, the 
percentage of emergency cases and transfers from nursing homes are taken into 
account. Such patients are at greater risk of dying than the average Medicare 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
Mortality data for 1986 and 1987 have been reanalyzed with the improved 
techniques. These results are included in the new report, as is summary 
statistical information on each hospital's services and staffing. Mortality is 
listed for "all causes" as well as for 16 individual "diagnostic categories." 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals were given a chance to review their statistics in advance and to 
provide explanations, which were published as part of the report. About 1,360 
hospitals, or 24% of the total, prepared such comments, compared to 51% of the 
hospitals for the report released in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In general, hospitals such as Humana Westminster that had higher than expected 
mortality rates defended the quality of their care. The most common 
explanations included the high-risk nature of their cases or discrepancies in 
data. 
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals initially felt threatened by the publication and commented in 
response to that apprehension," HCFA officials said in a written statement made 
available to reporters. "Hospitals now realize that the publication is perhaps 
of greater use to them than they originally believed. Rather than taking the 
time to object, hospitals have studied the results." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Morford, executive director of the HCFA Health Standards and Quality 
Bureau, which prepared the report, said that hospitals with consistently high 
Medicare mortality rates would be scrutinized by federal survey teams and 
Medicare watchdog organizations such as the California Medical Review. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't take punitive action" because a hospital has a high mortality rate, 
Morford said. "When presented with this information, I say, 'Let's look 
further.' " 
</P>
<P>
Such a survey of King Hospital in Los Angeles, based on its high 1987 mortality 
rates, discovered scores of patient care deficiencies and led to a threat that 
federal funds would be cut off. On Monday, the federal government, citing a 
"dramatic turnaround" at King, said Medicare and Medi-Cal funds would be 
continued.

MEDICARE DEATH RATES 
</P>
<P>
These California hospitals had the highest and lowest mortality rates for 
Medicare patients as compared to their predicted death rates between 1986 and 
1988, according to an analysis of U.S. Health Care Financing Administration 
data by Michael Pine &amp; Associates Inc., a Chicago health care consulting 
firm. The HCFA data was compiled earlier this year and made public Wednesday. 
Pine &amp; Associates was a consultant to HCFA on the preparation of the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The data reflects the percentage of a hospital's Medicare patients who died 
within 30 days of being admitted, whether as patients or after discharge. The 
national average 30-day mortality rate is about 12%. 
</P>
<P>
This list of high and low mortality rate hospitals, which was prepared by Pine 
&amp; Associates, differs in some instances from the report released by HCFA, 
although it is based on the same data. This is because different statistical 
techniques were used and data for the three years was combined. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals listed in boldface type had statistically significant high or low 
mortality rates for 1988, as well as for the entire three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
An asterisk indicates hospitals that sent explanatory comments about their data 
to HCFA.

NOTES: "Patient risk" is a measure of the relative risk of dying for a 
hospital's patients as compared to the national average risk. A value of "1" is 
average. A value over "1" is above average. A value under "1" is below average. 
</P>
<P>
The "% Higher" or "% Lower" than expected statistic is a comparison of the 
hospital's actual and predicted mortality rates. The predicted mortality rate 
takes into account characteristics of individual patients. These include age, 
sex, principal diagnosis, other chronic illnesses, previous hospitalizations, 
emergency or non-emergency admission status, admission source, such as a 
nursing home or hospital transfer, as well as the number of patients treated at 
each hospital. If a patient was hospitalized multiple times, only the last 
admission for each year was included. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California hospitals with more than 1,000 cases over the three-year 
period are listed, as well as hospitals from other parts of the state with more 
than 3,000 cases. There is a less than a one-in-1,000 probability that a

Divers have found one of two Japanese suicide submarines missing off the Indian 
Ocean island of Madagascar since World War II, Radio Madagascar said. 
</P>
<P>
A team of experts and divers from Japan and Madagascar found the 80-foot 
submarine in the Bay of Antsiranana (formerly called Diego Suarez) at the 
northern tip of Madagascar last weekend, the radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
The submarines were deployed in the area in May, 1942, to attack French and 
British warships. Their two or three-man crews were supposed to use the vessels 
as piloted torpedoesto ram enemy warships on suicide missions.

SUBSTITUTE TEACHER BASE SALARY RAISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to an areawide shortage of substitute teachers, the La Habra City 
School District has increased their salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Substitutes are not only needed to replace teachers who are ill, but also to 
cover classes for teachers participating in workshops and other training, said 
Assistant Supt. Ruth Fehr. 
</P>
<P>
When substitute teachers cannot be found, which Fehr said happens about once a 
month, school principals may fill in for teachers or withdraw permission for 
them to attend workshops or training. 
</P>
<P>
To attract more substitutes, the district has increased its base pay from $75 
to $85 per day. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective substitute teachers do not need to have a teaching credential, but 
must have a bachelor's degree. Although they are required to take the state's 
teacher proficiency test, they may start teaching with an emergency credential 
before the examination.

TROUBLED STUDENTS HAVE SPECIAL CLASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID F. BURKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten La Habra students in grades three through eight are attending special 
classes through an experimental program to help troubled young people stay in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
The La Habra City School District started the program in September for students 
whose behavioral problems were so severe that changing classes, and sometimes 
even changing school districts, did not help. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids aren't different from other kids except that they've made some bad 
choices," said Barry Beckman, teacher of the district's "Opportunity Classes." 
</P>
<P>
"They're still kids with a lot of the same concerns that every other young 
teen-ager has." 
</P>
<P>
Three of the 10 students have had problems with the law and are on probation, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those students tend to be a little easier to work with because they have to go 
to school as a condition of probation, and if they violate they go back into 
detention, and they don't want that," Beckman said. 
</P>
<P>
District officials, citing privacy laws, declined to allow students in the 
program to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Students are required to remain in the program for a minimum of six weeks. They 
attend either a morning or afternoon class, and must stay home for the balance 
of each school day. Beckman makes spot telephone calls and home visits to make 
sure the students stay at home when they are assigned to be there. 
</P>
<P>
The program can handle only 12 students because they tend to misbehave around 
large groups, Beckman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of group dynamics, they can't handle peer pressure," he said. "They 
can't handle peers in general." 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the program is to prepare the children for a return to the regular 
classroom. Of the original 10 students, nine are still in the special classes 
and one has returned to a regular classroom. 
</P>
<P>
School board President Antonio Valle Jr. is a supporter of the classes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an important program, and we're hopeful that it will be successful and 
provide help to a group of students who really need help," Valle said. DAVID F.

CITY HALL WILL CLOSE THROUGH HOLIDAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton City Hall will be closed for the holidays, Dec. 25 through Jan. 1. It 
will reopen at 8 a.m. on Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Essential services, such as police and fire protection, will be unaffected, but 
the city's libraries and recreation facilities will operate on reduced holiday 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Water bills deposited in the slot outside City Hall will be collected during 
the holiday week, and maintenance crews will be on stand-by in case of an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the reduced schedule saves money by closing offices where 
demand for services is typically slow during the holidays. Most employees will 
take the week off without pay.

147-UNIT CONDO PROJECT APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week approved the construction of a 147-condominium 
project in the Santiago Hills area of east Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The condominiums, ranging in size from 1,780 to 2,526 square feet, will be 
built on 11 acres northeast of the intersection of White Oak Ridge and Old Camp 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story condominiums will be built above garages that are partially below 
ground level. A spokesman for Pulte Home Corp. of Newport Beach said 
construction is scheduled to begin next fall and be completed in about two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no formal objection to the plan, resident Bob Bennyhoff said 
he is concerned that the condominiums, in effect, will be three-story buildings 
in an area that has a two-story limit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cheating, legal cheating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jack McGee, director of community development, said the buildings qualify 
as two-story structures under the city's building code.

HEIGHT PLAN TO GET FURTHER HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Wednesday voted to continue until Jan. 17 a public hearing 
on a proposed law that would restrict home heights to preserve views. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the law would create a 25-foot height restriction in neighborhoods 
in which residents have requested it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's patently unfair," Lee Riley, who recently bought property in San 
Clemente, told the council Wednesday night. "You can't go and change the rules 
now that we've bought the property." Riley was one of a few people to speak 
about the matter before the council voted to continue the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in ocean-view neighborhoods complained to the council in May that new 
construction was obstructing their views of the water and reducing their 
property values. At the time, the council voted down a proposed emergency 
moratorium on new building. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Planning Commission unanimously recommended that the council 
reject the proposed zoning plan, saying the city should not regulate the issue 
of views from private property. The commissioners urged that height questions 
be solved through homeowners' association regulations.

FIREFIGHTERS LIVE HIGH TO AID INJURED

Joe Cucinotti and Dave Valles say they never dreamed of doing anything as novel 
as sitting for four days atop a 150-foot-high snorkel platform attached to a 
fire truck. But when the idea was suggested for the sake of charity, both men 
volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
The two firefighters began their elevated vigil over the Orange County 
Fairgrounds on Wednesday and will stay there until Saturday in an effort to 
raise more than $50,000 for the Orange County Burn Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see the pain and suffering those burn victims must deal with daily, 
you'll do anything to to help them out," said Fountain Valley firefighter 
Cucinotti. 
</P>
<P>
Valles is a Costa Mesa firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
A board member for the association suggested the idea after traveling to Europe 
and seeing the same thing done to raise money for homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our members was very enthused and convinced that the same idea could 
work in this country," said Caryl Modrinski, executive director of the 
association. "At first we weren't sure how we'd get volunteers, but we had no 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
The association, which was formed in 1979, provides assistance to burn 
survivors and their families, and sponsors research related to burn care. This 
year, the organization hopes to raise enough money to continue providing 
various programs, including a summer camp for teen-agers and children who have 
suffered burns. 
</P>
<P>
Equipped with a television, stereo, electronic golf game and sleeping bags, 
Cucinotti and Valles will leave their platform basket only for five-minute 
breaks between now and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters on the ground will take turns standing guard and will also take 
donations from passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem I had was cramming all my Christmas shopping in before I got up 
here," Valles said. "But who knows? At 3 o'clock in the morning I may wake up 
and question why I am sleeping this high off the ground." ALLISON SAMUELS

STUART KARL TO TESTIFY PUBLICLY, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Refusing to grant Stuart Karl "a private court," a judge ruled Wednesday that 
the one-time whiz kid of the video industry will have to testify in public 
about his stormy business relationship with Lorimar Telepictures Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Karl, who rapidly gained riches through the Jane Fonda workout videos but fell 
nearly as quickly into bankruptcy and political scandal, is expected to be a 
key witness in an ongoing legal malpractice trial in Orange County Superior 
Court. He may testify next month. 
</P>
<P>
Court Shannon and Gary Hunt, two of Karl's former associates in an Irvine-based 
video venture, are suing their ex-attorney, Michael Genovese of Newport Beach, 
for $2 million in malpractice damages. 
</P>
<P>
They claim that Genovese gave them bad advice about potential 
conflict-of-interest issues in their video business, triggering legal problems 
for the two businessmen and the loss of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Karl, Shannon and Hunt were all executives in an Irvine company called 
Karl-Lorimar Home Video, a division of Lorimar. But all three resigned in 
March, 1987, after Lorimar discovered that they also had financial interests in 
a Torrance company that was a supplier to Karl-Lorimar. 
</P>
<P>
Karl did not join in the lawsuit by Shannon and Hunt, nor did he attend 
Wednesday's hearing. He may, however, play a critical role in the issue's 
resolution by revealing key information about business dealings gone bad, 
lawyers in the case say. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for both Genovese and Karl asked Superior Court Judge Kazuharu Makino 
on Wednesday to allow Karl to testify in secret, with the court closed to the 
public and news media. 
</P>
<P>
To have Karl testify in public, they argued, would raise sensitive matters of 
attorney-client privilege and might put Karl at risk of divulging information 
that could be used against him in his pending legal battles with Lorimar. 
</P>
<P>
And George Genzmer, defending Genovese against the malpractice claim, also 
asserted that an open court would only produce more of the type of "bad 
publicity" that Shannon and Hunt cited in bringing their lawsuit. "We are 
simply trying to shut that down," Genzmer said. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Makino said he saw no reason to give Karl "a private court" or to 
disregard "the right of the public to hear what goes on in court." 
</P>
<P>
It was only the latest legal turn against the 37-year-old Karl, who by his 
early 30s had forged his success in the video industry into a role as a 
Democratic Party activist and fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, he was fined $60,000 and sentenced to three years' probation 
in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana after admitting to illegal campaign 
financing in funneling $185,000 to former presidential contender Gary Hart and 
other political candidates. 
</P>
<P>
And in July, as federal officials sought to auction his multimillion-dollar 
home in Newport Beach, Karl filed for bankruptcy protection against nearly $4 
million in delinquent taxes and other debts. His estate, in the Big Canyon area 
of the city, is set to be auctioned Jan. 5. ERIC LICHTBLAU

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MEETING SLATED ON HANDICAP HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chief lawyer for the state Department of Developmental Services said 
Wednesday that the agency plans to meet in early January with an Orange County 
group that has complained about the lack of housing for the handicapped in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe their allegation that we're failing to meet our legal 
obligations," said Joseph O. Egan, chief counsel for the department, in a 
telephone interview from Sacramento. "But we want to meet with them to discuss 
some of the issues they are raising." 
</P>
<P>
Egan was referring to a Dec. 13 letter by the Tustin-based citizens group that 
oversees governmental aid to the handicapped. That watchdog group, whose formal 
title is Area XI Developmental Disabilities Board, accused the state of acting 
illegally by not providing enough money for housing handicapped adults and 
children in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The letter also formally charged the department with being "out of compliance" 
with state law -- a charge that automatically requires the department to make 
an internal review. The Orange County group, under state law, has the power to 
review the government's performance in providing aid to the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Egan said Wednesday that the department now has received and reviewed the 
letter from the watchdog group. He said that while the department rejects the 
group's charges of not obeying state law, "we think we can work with them and 
clear up some of their problems." BILL BILLITER

TSUJI'S THREE-POINT FLURRY GIVES RANCHO ALAMITOS THE BOLSA GRANDE TITLE

<P>
Trabuco Hills High School knew all about Rancho Alamitos guard Shellie Tsuji 
and her ability to hit three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
They had seen her hit three Tuesday in the Vaqueros' victory over Rim of the 
World in the semifinals of the Bolsa Grande Lady Matador Holiday Basketball 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
So, for the first three quarters in Friday night's championship game, Trabuco 
Hills paid special attention the 5-foot, 3-inch Tsuji, holding her to just two 
points. But then, midway through the fourth quarter, Trabuco Hills backed off. 
That's when Tsuji hit four three-point baskets, including three straight, to 
give Rancho Alamitos control of the game and a 72-54 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"They were coming up in my face and they were blocking my shot," Tsuji said. 
"Then in the fourth quarter they started backing off because I was bricking 'em 
so bad." 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros (5-1) led, 44-42, at the end of the third quarter but outscored 
Trabuco Hills, 28-12, in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Tsuji was the game's leading scorer with 16 points, 14 of them in the fourth 
quarter. Jenny Newsome, who missed almost eight minutes of the first half with 
foul trouble, added 15 for the Vaqueros and was the tournament's most valuable 
player. Melinda Lira scored 11 points including three key three-point shots to 
keep Trabuco Hills at bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Shellie Tsuji had a rough night (early) but she came through when we needed 
her," Vaquero Coach Bob Becker said. "I think she was about 0-15 before she 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
"The threes helped," added Becker, who also praised his team's hustle. "The 
last four minutes we really got down and worked hard." 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills missed 14 of 23 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we got a little harum-scarum and gave up a lot of shots the last four 
minutes," said Trabuco Hills Coach Paul Beidler. "They got hot from outside and 
kind of put us away." 
</P>
<P>
DeDe Sampson led Trabuco Hills with 14 points. Joelle Castro had 13 and Shelly 
Callhoun 11. 
</P>
<P>
In other Bolsa Grande Tournament games: 
</P>

KOSTOFF GETS 40 POINTS, BUT EDISON ROLLS PAST CAPISTRANO VALLEY, 82-59

Capistrano Valley High School, considered by some to be the best two-man team 
in Orange County, was reduced to a one-man show Wednesday night in its 
nonleague game at Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley forward Scott McCorkle, who only five days ago scored 33 
points in an impressive victory over Ocean View, sat out an 82-59 loss to 
Edison. 
</P>
<P>
"(McCorkle) has been sick every game we've played this year," Coach Mark 
Thornton said. "He had pneumonia before the season started and then got the 
flu. Since then, he's been practicing or playing, and he can't get over it." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Chris Kostoff had to carry the offensive load with McCorkle sidelined, 
and he kept pace with a very good Edison team for three quarters. Kostoff 
scored 40 points, including eight three-pointers, but Capistrano Valley (7-2) 
lost for the second time in its past three games. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (7-2) put the game away early in the fourth quarter. Forward Steve Thobe 
completed a three-point play to push Edison ahead, 56-44, with 6:13 remaining 
and then teammate Brandon Jessie scored on a dunk following a steal for a 
14-point lead moments later. 
</P>
<P>
Kostoff posted impressive numbers, but Jessie was easily the most impressive 
player on the court. The sophomore and son of former Ram receiver Ron Jessie is 
the most graceful athlete to compete in the Sunset League since Emile Harry was 
a two-sport star at Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Jessie repeatedly used his quick first step to drive to the basket, scoring 23 
points. He also pulled down 11 rebounds and blocked three shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't trade him for anybody else his age," said Jon Borchert, Edison's 
coach. "All he needs is the experience to become a great player. He certainly 
has the athletic ability." 
</P>
<P>
Edison has five starters returning from last year's tri-championship team, and 
with the emergence of Jessie, the Chargers figure to contend with any team in 
the county. While Edison beat one of the county's best teams, Borchert said his 
players were disappointed that McCorkle didn't play. 
</P>
<P>
"They were really excited about playing against him, and when he didn't play, 
that took some of the edge off the game," Borchert said. "But I was happy with 
the way everyone played tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The victory may have been costly, however. Bill Martineau, Edison's 6-foot-9 
center who has signed with UC Santa Barbara, left in the third quarter 
complaining of lower back pain. Martineau had a back injury last summer that 
limited his playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to wait and see how it goes tomorrow," Borchert said. "I'd 
hate to lose him now, I've only had him healthy for a week and a half." 
</P>
<P>
Edison made 21 of 27 shots in the second half but Kostoff's three-point 
shooting kept Capistrano Valley close for a while. Sixth-man Todd Smyser helped 
Edison pull away in the fourth quarter, however, by scoring 10 of his 16 points 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a good team, and unfortunately, Kostoff was the only shooter we had on 
the court tonight," Thornton said. "I figure league (play) is more important, 
so we've got to have Scott healthy. That's all there is to it." 
</P>
<P>
In other nonleague basketball: 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 52, Servite 44 -- Thomas Clayton had 13 points and David Beilstein had 
12 to lead host Tustin (9-0). Steve Marusich led all scorers with 18 points and 
Adam Anderson added 14 for Servite (6-4). 
</P>
<P>
Loara 90, Villa Park 73 -- Tes Whitlock had 23 points and 12 assists and Joey 
Guadio had 23 points and 11 rebounds to lead host Loara (7-0). Ellick Hsu added 
13 for Loara. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 58, Woodbridge 57 -- John Molle scored 34 points, including two free 
throws with 12 seconds left, to give Irvine (5-5) the victory over visiting 
Woodbridge (5-4). Molle, a 6-foot-5 junior forward, had missed the three 
previous games with a sprained ankle. He was 11 of 17 from the field, including 
a pair of three-point goals, and was 10 of 10 from the free line. He also had 
10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Valley 51, Southern California Christian 48 -- Southern California 
Christian's rally led by Shawn Wiltshire, who made two three-point shots in the 
fourth quarter, fell short. Wiltshire led all scorers with 20 points. Scottie 
Strong scored 14 and Sean Wilson had 12 for Santa Ana Valley (2-4). 
</P>
<P>
Gahr 73, Sunny Hills 58 -- Brandon Titus scored 27 points to lead Gahr at Sunny 
Hills. David Ragsdale scored 14 for Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Norco 57, Canyon 44 -- Kevin Wilborn had 15 points for host Canyon (3-5). 
</P>
<P>
In the Carson City, Nev., Tournament: 
</P>
<P>
El Toro 64, Hug (Reno) 51 -- Greg Everett had 17 points and 10 rebounds to lead 
El Toro (6-1), which never trailed. Kevin Martin and Rob Johnson each had 15 
points and Kirk Riddle had eight points and a game-high 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
In the Fullerton Tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 63, Garden Grove 59 -- Trailing, 61-48, with 3:23 remaining, the 
Argonauts scored 11 consecutive points and trailed, 61-59, with 23 seconds 
left. Fullerton's Rene Arias made two free throws with seven seconds left to 
clinch the victory.

<P>
RETAILING: BUSINESSES UTILIZE THE BUILT-IN ADVANTAGE OF MALL CROWDS BY SETTING 
UP TEMPORARY OUTLETS AND BYPASSING THE COST OF A PERMANENT STORE.

<P>
Just three weeks after opening their first store in October, the owners of the 
California Candle Co. found a quick way to expand by placing two temporary 
stores in local malls for the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
The stores give California Candle increased exposure and sales without the cost 
and commitment of opening permanent locations, according to Beverly Kaltenbach, 
part-owner of California Candle in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Every Christmas season, retailers sign on to a waiting list for temporary 
stores and kiosks so they can tap the holiday crowds that pack the malls. 
</P>
<P>
"For Christmas, a high volume can be done in a short period of time," 
Kaltenbach said. "Retailers in general do about 60% of their business in 
December." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's major malls lease vacant store spaces, kiosks and push carts to 
a variety of merchants during the holidays. Some have three or four temporary 
tenants during the holiday season. Others, such as South Coast Plaza and the 
Brea Mall, have 10 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the merchants start moving in during mid-October or early November, and 
by the day after Thanksgiving, all are open for business. 
</P>
<P>
The Buena Park Mall, with 14 seasonal stores this year, averages about five 
repeat stores each year, according to manager Lois Daniels. They include See's 
Candy, the Place Where Santa Shops and Swiss Colony. 
</P>
<P>
One of the traditional stores that operates at the local malls from year to 
year during the Christmas season is Knott's Berry Farm. After experimenting 
with their first temporary store eight years ago in the city of Orange, Knott's 
has since expanded its operation to 28 holiday gift centers in Southern 
California. Orange County is host to seven of those shops, said Tom LeBouf, 
manager of merchandise operations, and is the leading area in terms of sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to stay in the Southern California area because that's where our name 
is big," LeBouf said. "We depend on the heavy foot traffic because most of our 
products are bought on impulse." 
</P>
<P>
Preparation for the temporary spaces begins in July, he said. The biggest 
challenge in setting up holiday stores is hiring and training the staff. 
Another challenge is designing and decorating the stores. 
</P>
<P>
Another familiar competitor in the market is Hickory Farms. Starting its first 
kiosk in 1965 in Florida, Hickory Farms now has about 1,000 temporary locations 
throughout the United States, said Jack D. Bancer, director of advertising and 
sales promotions. Eleven are in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Once the spaces in the malls are leased, it takes approximately five days to 
set up and deliver the supplies to the different locations. Labor costs to set 
up and tear down the kiosks run a few hundred dollars, Bancer said, adding that 
it is money well spent. 
</P>
<P>
"It increases our annual volume by about 35%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers to the temporary market are Roger Dunn Golf Shop, Dena Dorsett 
Lingerie and Mrs. Fields Cookies at South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court. 
</P>
<P>
For the new players, the hours spent preparing supplies and staff needed to set 
up temporary stores were worth it, Kaltenbach said. California Candle set up 
quarters at MainPlace in Santa Ana and Fashion Island in Newport Beach to 
supplement its Laguna Beach store. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen people come to our main store that have seen us at the malls," 
Kaltenbach said. "We will do this again next year."

Trading Switch: Shares in Landmark Bancorp, the parent company of Landmark Bank 
in La Habra, began trading this week on a national computerized 
over-the-counter exchange, a move that will cut the costs of trading the stock 
and make it more accessible to a wider investor group. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark stock is now listed on the National Market System of the National 
Assn. of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations. NASDAQ provides price 
quotations for many New York Stock Exchange companies as well as 
over-the-counter firms. 
</P>
<P>
Craig D. Collette, Landmark's president, said the listing gives investors "the 
best of both worlds" by providing continuous trading and by creating more 
vigorous competition among many market makers. Until now, Landmark stock had 
been traded through eight market makers, brokers who dictated the price at 
which they would buy and sell the company's stock. Compiled by James S.

Purchase Completed: Royal Trustco Ltd., the Toronto financial services 
conglomerate that bought Pacific Savings Bank in Costa Mesa in mid-October, has 
completed its purchase of Pacific First Financial Corp., a Seattle thrift 
holding company. 
</P>
<P>
And the Seattle firm has completed its previously announced purchase of the 
California-based residential real estate construction lending unit of Old Stone 
Bank, a federal S&amp;L based in Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Like the purchase of Pacific Savings, the purchase of the Old Stone assets will 
help Royal Trust establish a thrift operation along the West Coast. Pacific 
First Financial operates S&amp;Ls in Washington and Oregon and manages Pacific 
Savings, now called Pacific First Bank. Eventually, all thrift operations will 
be merged into one and will be run out of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its deal to acquire Pacific First Financial, Royal Trust agreed to 
sell over time about 1.4 million shares of Glenfed Inc., the Glendale holding 
company of Glendale Federal Savings &amp; Loan. Royal Trust had acquired 9.5%, 
or about 2.5 million shares, of Glenfed and must reduce its holdings to less 
than 5% to comply with federal law. Compiled by James S. Granelli / Times staff

TURKS GO FOR GOLD, MISTRUST PAPER STOCKS; 
</P>
<P>
PRECIOUS METALS: THE GOVERNMENT IS URGING INVESTMENT IN CERTIFICATES, BUT 
PEOPLE HAVE YET TO TAKE A SHINE TO THEM.

<P>
Turkish hoarders, mistrustful of paper securities, have turned their country 
into a pot of hidden gold. 
</P>
<P>
Economists say there's enough of the precious metal socked away to pay off the 
country's entire $36-billion foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
"Turkey's gold stock is huge . . . all physical. Now it must be as much as 
3,500 metric tons," Istanbul-based economist Ersin Pertan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The 3,500 tons is the conservative figure," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials are trying to persuade reluctant Turks to put their trust 
in gold certificates and futures -- what one dealer dismissed as "pieces of 
paper." 
</P>
<P>
It will not be an easy task. Since Ottoman times, Turks from all classes have 
taken refuge in gold, storing it in hiding places or wearing it as jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people have no faith in paper," said Muharrem Ozuslu, head of the Jewelers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Away from the busy traffic around Taksim Square in the labyrinthine alleys of 
the Covered Bazaar, treasures recalling the tales of Ali Baba glitter in shop 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
"Gold is always the favorite," gold dealer Oguz Peker explained as he handled 
several transactions. Across his counter, a peasant woman was buying a 22-carat 
gold chain as thick as a baby snake. 
</P>
<P>
Another gold trader in a small booth under the medieval cupolas cut gold strips 
and stashed them in a tobacco tin. "People are buying crazily," he said with a 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank-brokered gold market, established in April, has sold more than 
80 tons of gold since it opened. But only 22 pounds of that has been resold to 
the market. The rest is believed to be nestled beneath lace pillows or in hope

Dealers say jewelers buy the bulk of the central bank's gold at world market 
rates. Gold is currently trading in New York at just over $400 an ounce, but 
formerly the jewelers paid smugglers much higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers say the central bank has succeeded in cutting down the smuggling, which 
had run at about 70 million tons a year. 
</P>
<P>
But government officials say the crackdown on smuggling is only the first step. 
They aspire to establishing a gold market, where futures and gold certificates 
can be traded, and a spot market, which could eventually make Turkey a Middle 
East center for worldwide gold trading. 
</P>
<P>
"Investment in physical gold is a dead one. You should hold certificates, 
futures contracts instead," said an official who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
But dealers are doubtful. They say it will take at least another generation 
before trading in paper gold can dull the shine of the real thing, collected by 
Turks for centuries and set aside as "shroud money."

GUARANTEEING DIPLOMAS CALLED GOOD BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SOME SCHOOLS WILL TAKE A GRADUATE BACK AND SHARPEN CERTAIN SKILLS, 
IF THE EMPLOYER FINDS THEM LACKING. AND CHECKING A NEWLY HIRED WORKER'S SCHOOL 
RECORDS IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

"Too many kids, whether they have a diploma or not, just aren't up to the 
standard that business needs," insists Robert Kolberg, president of the 
National Alliance for Business. 
</P>
<P>
Now, business finds itself being increasingly involved by educators in 
narrowing the skills gap. Businesses have been surveyed to see what skills 
their employees need. Some new hires are coming to them with diploma 
guarantees. And some businesses are being shown students' transcripts, 
attendance records and even academic portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
One of the earliest and most intensive survey efforts was the Colorado 
Department of Education's 1983 survey of 250 businesses. Two-thirds said new 
employees had problems doing basic writing tasks. More than 40% reported 
trouble in basic communications and math. From this, educators developed a list 
of 120 competencies for students to master. Oregon and Michigan have taken 
similar surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado also has 10 districts that guarantee diplomas. Forty others are 
expected to adopt the program this winter. 
</P>
<P>
Montrose is one of the few Colorado towns in which newly employed graduates 
have come back for the promised help. Schools Supt. Robert Cito explains that a 
key problem is inadequate speed and comprehension. Many who sign up for the 
armed forces have been unable to finish preliminary, timed tests. New employees 
at nursing homes have been similarly challenged in trying to read and calculate 
in such chores as mixing cleaning solutions, Cito says. That graduates can 
immediately apply what they learn in the retraining increases motivation and 
effectiveness, he says. 
</P>
<P>
In Massachusetts' Plymouth-Carver district, the diploma guarantee takes effect 
with next spring's graduates. Supt. Bernard Sidman says he hopes it will 
inspire younger students to work harder. "Knowing that an employer could demand 
that they bone up on their skills, maybe they'll pay a little more attention 
while fully enrolled." 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Robert Willis of the Rock Island-Milan schools in Illinois says the 
program lets former students and the community know that "we're always here for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the program has some community relations value -- we wouldn't 
minimize that," says Tom Brodie, coordinator of elementary and secondary school 
programs in Wayzata, Minn., a district near Minneapolis that adopted the 
diploma guarantee two years ago. "But I think it says to the business 
community, 'We have the same concern for quality that you do and we're willing 
to work with you on it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Yet the guarantee is only half a step, says Scott Thomson, executive director 
of the National Assn. of Secondary School Principals. In his view, it is 
"madness" to guarantee an often-absent graduate with a "D" average. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very tolerant school system," he says. "High school students can get 
a diploma pretty much by warming a seat. . . . What's important is the 
student's track record. We need to improve the process by which employers look 
at the record and determine who's employable or not." 
</P>
<P>
The best evidence, educators admit, is not the diploma but the academic 
transcript. Some graduates now also carry portfolios of their schoolwork. 
Vermont is trying to encourage each student to develop one. Yet few employers 
ask to see transcripts or portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, they haven't gone beyond the diploma," admits NAB president 
Kolberg. "They ought to be asking for transcripts, insisting that high school 
work matters." 
</P>
<P>
IBM executive Robert Gholson agrees that employer interest in school 
performance could make a difference. "If we don't want kids to drop out of 
school, then we shouldn't hire dropouts." 
</P>
<P>
Transcripts are usually attached to resumes in Western Europe and Japan. The 
now defunct Commission on Work Force Quality and Labor Market Efficiency -- a 
bipartisan group set up by the secretary of labor to study such comparisons -- 
urged the use of transcripts in the hiring process. 
</P>
<P>
In the southwestern Colorado community of Pagosa Springs, high school officials 
have taken the unusual step for the last five years of attaching a microfiche 
transcript to each student's diploma. Principal Ron Shaw says employers in the 
community are starting to make good use of the offering. "It's a chance to make 
students accountable for what they do," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Many businesses are eager to play a much more active role in the schools. 
"Business and the schools need to develop a closer, trusting relationship, to 
break down the barriers," Kolberg says. "If we're going to be successful, we 
need to do this job of school-to-work transition together."

Will the next decade bring urban strife, economic decline and environmental 
catastrophes? Or will it produce peace, prosperity and big advances in diverse 
areas such as science and technology and ordinary Americans' personal lives? 
</P>
<P>
Any attempt at prescience, of course, demands scrutiny, for every forecast 
reflects matters of experience, expertise, perspective and time. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there are generations of differences in how some Californians of 
varying ages -- not necessarily forecasting professionals, many of whom already 
have provided plenty of reasons for us to be chary of them -- predict the 1990s 
will shape up: 
</P>
<P>
* 9-year-old Ikemefuna Udeze sees a grander, more hopeful world with the 
promise of cures of deadly disease and lessened crime and drug use. 
</P>
<P>
* 19-year-old Steve Lerner envisions the decline of America as an international 
economic power. 
</P>
<P>
* 29-year-old Bridgette Burton projects dangerous rifts between the haves and 
have-nots, although she has big dreams for her own South-Central Los Angeles 
family. 
</P>
<P>
* 39-year-old Steve Grant wonders whether professional accomplishments can be 
matched with personal fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
* 49-year-old Carmen Perez forecasts ripe political times for Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
* 59-year-old Rosalind Wyman worries about society's unresolved problems in 
education and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
* 69-year-old Stanley Sheinbaum offers a dark, comic vision of the price of 
what he calls present political cowardice. 
</P>
<P>
* 79-year-old Artie Shaw takes an upbeat swing at the future, despite his 
accounting for some downbeat concerns. 
</P>
<P>
* 89-year-old Kourken Alexander forecasts breakthroughs in space travel and 
personal health care.

Ikemefuna Udeze shines with young faith, fresh idealism and a sense of personal 
opportunity that is very much the heritage of America. He certainly is its 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Ikemefuna ("Call me KK because nobody in school can pronounce my name") is from 
a large family and a son of parents who came to Los Angeles from Nigeria to 
live better and achieve more. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Udeze, his mother, is a nutritionist with Kaiser Permanente. Clement 
Udeze, his father, is an assistant professor at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
And at 9, their poised youngster is quite clear about his path through the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm 19, I'm going to be in college," he says. "If you get a good 
education, you know what you're doing and how to plan your life. If you drop 
out, you won't be ready for anything." 
</P>
<P>
KK, a fourth-grader at 3rd Street Elementary School in Los Angeles, doesn't 
know if he will become a teacher or a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
But he is certain where either career must take him. 
</P>
<P>
He wants to be a governor or a mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Or President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The country could do worse than follow the platform of social reform and 
technological progress represented by KK's vision of events of the decade 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990s, he says, should see a reduction in gang violence ("I think it is 
stupid that young people are killing young people") and drug abuse ("When you 
take drugs, you make all kinds of other dumb decisions") by the hiring of more 
police officers and heavier court penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking and drinking will dwindle to a minimum with broader public acceptance 
of their health dangers. More government and private money spent on research, 
KK says, will produce new medicines "to cure diseases like AIDS and cancer . . 
. so people won't be dying right and left." 
</P>
<P>
"In the year 2000, we will have telephones where you see who you are talking 
to, and that will stop a lot of crank and threatening calls. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be the big earthquake so we might be repairing our city 10 years 
from now. If it hasn't occurred, we should be fully prepared for it by then. 
</P>
<P>
"Airplanes will be traveling farther, faster and safer. I think people will be 
on Jupiter by the year 2000. Terrorism will end as soon as people open up to 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there's this thing called the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
"But it can't work if we realize that we are all the same . . . that blacks, 
Hispanics, Asians and whites are all human beings. I don't mind (other races). 
I accept them for who they are, not what they are." 
</P>
<P>
KK isn't, however, all smoldering humanitarianism and gifted-student grades. He 
likes Nintendo games, designer sweat shirts over polo shirts and writing 
good-knight-evil-knight fairy tales on a classroom Apple computer. His heroes 
are his parents, Bill Cosby and Benjamin Franklin in precisely that order. 
</P>
<P>
KK is boy enough to have busted his chin in a fall, but courtly enough to 
mention that his sisters are Ifeyinwa, Ije-Enu and Omelogo, and his brother is 
Arinze, and that their names should be included in any story involving him and 
the family Udeze. 
</P>
<P>
KK also likes baseball and basketball. His final projection for the next 
decade: The Lakers will continue to monopolize the NBA championships. PAUL DEAN

Carmen O. Perez, 49, a political mover and shaker in the Latino community, says 
she is looking forward to "passing on the banner of political activism" to a 
younger generation in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to double our efforts in the next decade," she says of efforts to 
increase the political empowerment and education for Latinos in Los Angeles and 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
As vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee and assistant chief 
deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, Perez will be leading the 
way. But she predicts the struggle won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
"California has 466 Latino officeholders," says Perez, the mother of four grown 
children. "We have 3,360 Latinos in offices nationwide, and we have seen the 
Latino voting-age population grow over 2% in the decade of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"But still that is not enough. We need to move ahead and get candidates elected 
to all offices. That's why we cannot sit out the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
Her goals? Besides getting more Latinos elected to city, county, state and 
national offices, she wants to see a reduction in the high Latino 
school-dropout rate because "our success in the next decade will depend heavily 
on education." 
</P>
<P>
She believes the opportunities will be plentiful for Latinos nationwide in 
politics, education and employment: "We have young, wonderful, talented, 
articulate individuals in the Hispanic community -- talented young men and 
women with master's degrees, degrees they know are going to help them and their 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Perez says that Latinos in the political process -- from grass-roots efforts to 
legislative officeholders -- view the '90s as the springboard for greater 
accomplishments in their community; "giving back" to the barrio will be a key 
goal for Latinos in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
"We enter the future decade a lot wiser from past experiences," Perez says, 
"and ready to contribute to our neighborhoods and strengthen our families even 
more because the 1980s proved to us that we could get together, that we could 
get organized and make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
But she says the challenge for Latinos in the 1990s will be to hold on to their 
political gains and advance themselves in other areas, such as education, jobs 
and life style: "We have the numbers. Our efforts in voter registration prove 
it. The Latino population will continue to grow, and issues such as 
redistricting will be among the most important and vital to our community." 
</P>
<P>
The 1990s, she predicts, will produce "increased leadership, and there is no 
doubt that education will be the key to this process for a community that is 
diverse, thriving, strong and definitely a part of the American dream." MICHAEL 
QUINTANILLA

2 MAJOR WORRIES

<P>
When Rosalind Wyman, 59, a community activist and former member of the Los 
Angeles City Council, looks to the future, "two things come to mind that worry 
me. One is the American educational system. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are falling down terribly, and I have great concern about the 
future of the people who have to run this world," says Wyman, who has racked up 
an impressive list of firsts in politics and public service. 
</P>
<P>
At 22, and just out of USC, she was the first woman elected to the Los Angeles 
City Council. She then became the first woman on the Coliseum Commission and 
the first woman to be acting mayor. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, she was the first woman to chair a Democratic congressional 
fund-raising dinner, and the first to raise more than $1 million at such an 
event. In 1984, she became the first woman to head a major political party 
convention when she became chairwoman and chief executive officer of the 
Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next decade," she says, "if we don't upgrade and realize that our 
educational system is failing, how can we continue to be leaders in the world? 
</P>
<P>
"That brings me to the second major concern: the environment we live in. It's a 
most critical concern. The air, the water, the transportation: How do we make 
those things better? 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't make them better in the next 10 years, I think you'll find many 
systems that we're used to living with will just break down and become 
nonfunctional," Wyman says. 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, she adds, "one really good thing is that I'm going to be 
a grandmother for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Another good thing is that in the last year of this decade, the abortion issue 
has awakened the consciousness of American women. I am hopeful that in the next 
decade women will emerge as caring leaders of this country." BETTIJANE LEVINE

CAUGHT IN A CRUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ELIZABETH VENANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stanley Sheinbaum, 69, paints a darkly comic vignette to illustrate the state 
of the nation near the year 2000. The Malaysians, says the political activist 
and publisher of New Perspectives Quarterly, will be organizing vacation tours 
to the United States, featuring a stop in the Napa Valley vineyards, where 
tourists will observe picturesque Californians crushing grapes by foot. 
</P>
<P>
Current geopolitical power shifts are likely to leave the United States in a 
crunch between an aggressive Japan and a unified European marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about a long-term gradual slide," says Sheinbaum of the American 
living standard and the concurrent power slippage in competing international 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
The catalyst for the downturn is the much lamented but unresolved foreign debt, 
for which the unwillingness of government leaders to face the financial crisis 
is to blame, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Japanese investments in U.S. real estate and Treasury securities are 
helping to offset the trade deficit. But Sheinbaum agrees with economists who 
predict that after 1992, the Japanese may switch their investments to the 
European community. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is the taxpayer's dollar that is financing the foreign debt, and 
the results of the drain on other potential areas of funding, from education to 
bridges and roads, will become more dramatic, he says. 
</P>
<P>
In cities, apartment blocks will replace private homes, which will continue to 
become even more of a luxury of the wealthy, he theorizes. College will become 
too expensive for even some upper middle class youths, while corporations, 
unable to find appropriately educated American employees, will accelerate 
establishment of operations abroad. College-age youths will be accepting jobs 
in Burger Kings at a third of what young people typically earned 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still convinced we're the most powerful nation in the world," Sheinbaum 
says sardonically. The way to regain that status, he says, is to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, "we have cowards on both sides of politics, Democrats as well as 
Republicans." ELIZABETH VENANT

ZIGS AND ZAGS

<P>
Artie Shaw, at 79, describes himself as "getting to a nice curmudgeonly state. 
I was a young fogie. Now I'm a good old one." 
</P>
<P>
At his most curmudgeonly, the legendary bandleader-clarinetist, who lives 
quietly in Newbury Park and is writing his fourth book, says of the coming 
decade: "I'm delighted to see we're going to get into the '90s. For a long time 
I've been doubting that. And I have a strong doubt we'll get into the next 
century." 
</P>
<P>
Progress zigs and zags, Shaw observes, "and we're on a big zag right now." 
</P>
<P>
He despairs of a human race intent on "covering (the earth) with cement," 
"cutting the horns off rhinos" and "screwing ourselves up" through technology. 
</P>
<P>
He considers himself "as close to being sane as I know of." He lectures often, 
helping people make sense of the information overload. "Everybody's up to his 
nostrils in ignorance," he says. "I'm a professional confusion defuser." 
</P>
<P>
Although acknowledged as one of the world's greatest living clarinetists, he 
dismisses that superlative, saying, "What are the criteria? It's all in the ear 
of the beholder." 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't touched the clarinet since 1954. No, not even for his own amusement. 
"How can it be amusing?" he asks. "It's like asking a fighter if he goes into 
the ring for his own amusement. It's very hard work. You're always trying to do 
what you did better." 
</P>
<P>
But even today, he says, "my fingers are playing music. I wake up with dreams 
of looking for the concert hall, the theater. . . . " Still, he "hated, 
loathed" being a celebrity and the price it exacted. 
</P>
<P>
In the '30s and '40s, that meant endless one-night-stands. He says, "My 
definition of hell is to have to play 'Begin the Beguine' (his 1938 classic) 
the rest of my life. Now, Cole Porter wrote a damned good piece of music, but. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
There's still an Artie Shaw band on the road, but Shaw himself is a homebody 
who believes "the best trip is the one where you can be home by noon." 
</P>
<P>
Wed eight times -- his wives included Lana Turner and Ava Gardner -- he says he 
and companion Midge Hayes, a former librarian, have no plans to marry: "We both 
did that." 
</P>
<P>
People send him records, most of which he considers "a lot of noise and a lot 
of anger . . . most of the so-called music, rock and all that, it's glitz . . . 
show business." 
</P>
<P>
Back to the future -- "I hope we make it," Shaw says, adding, "whatever 
happens, I'm going to be doing what I like when it does." BEVERLY BEYETTE

RACIAL LINEUP CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Changes in Orange County's racial composition between now and the middle of the 
1990s will leave the county with a smaller percentage of whites and a larger 
share of Latinos. The county's white population, now about three in four 
people, will drop to seven in 10 while Latinos will comprise more than one in 
five. Blacks are projected to remain at around the 1% level. This continues the 
general trend in racial composition that has obtained since the outset of the 
'80s. Whites then were 78%, Latinos 15% and blacks 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Shown here are the estimated racial population groupings now, the projections 
for 1994 and the changes:

COMMUNITY LEADERS PROJECT THE BIG ISSUES FACING THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times Orange County Edition asked about 200 community leaders -- from 
government, business, entertainment and charitable organizations -- what they 
think will be the single biggest challenge that Orange County faces in the 
1990s, either in their area of expertise or in general. Here are some of their 
responses. 
</P>
<P>
Jack W. Peltason, chancellor of UCI 
</P>
<P>
"One might expect the biggest challenge in Orange County, from the perspective 
of a university chancellor, to deal with education. And indeed it does. The 
challenge will be to educate our community to understand and assist with the 
grave crisis in our county health-care system. The crisis affects not only the 
poor and indigent residents of our community. Every single person who may be 
the victim of an accident or in need of emergency services is endangered when 
emergency rooms are forced to close their doors due to inadequate cost 
reimbursements from government agencies." 
</P>
<P>
TOP ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
* Health care 
</P>
<P>
* Transportation 
</P>
<P>
* Changing demographics 
</P>
<P>
* Support for all segments of education 
</P>
<P>
* Ensuring a well-educated electorate 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Schneider, county administrative officer 
</P>
<P>
"Transportation, beyond a doubt, is the single most challenging issue of the 
1990s. Without adequate transportation infrastructure, this county will not 
grow to its fullest potential. An inadequate transportation system will affect 
every aspect of our lives, including air quality, housing, economic well-being 
and ability to enjoy the county's recreational opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
TOP ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
* Transportation 
</P>
<P>
* Housing 
</P>
<P>
* Air quality 
</P>
<P>
* Criminal justice (jails and courts) 
</P>
<P>
* Local government financing 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Kennedy, executive director, Orange County Human Relations Commission 
</P>
<P>
Biggest challenge: "Intolerance towards the poor. Whether it is anger at 
Hispanic day laborers, hostility towards social services in neighborhoods, 
opposition to housing affordable to very low-income workers or opposition to 
jails being built even in remote canyons. As the county grows richer as a whole 
I see a dangerous slide towards intolerance, the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) 
syndrome. Can we build a county where rich and poor can live together is the 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
TOP ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
* Intolerance towards the poor -- NIMBY syndrome 
</P>
<P>
* Transportation versus slow growth 
</P>
<P>
* Wage polarization -- growth at the high and low ends of the wage scale 
</P>
<P>
* Housing for very low-income workers 
</P>
<P>
* Intergroup conflict 
</P>
<P>
James Enright, chief deputy district attorney 
</P>
<P>
"While it would be easy to focus in on the drugs-equals-crime equation, I don't 
believe that is our overall biggest challenge in the county (because we have 
public awareness and support in this area). 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question in my mind the major problem facing the county in the 
'90s will be in the area of transportation. At the close of the '80s we are 
almost at gridlock. If we leave the planning to the builders and the recipients 
of their largess we will have a traffic nightmare by the end of the century." 
</P>
<P>

Brad Gates, Orange County sheriff-coroner 
</P>
<P>
Biggest challenge: "Leadership. This county has not had the political 
leadership to solve the problems during the '80s and it does not appear we will 
have any leaders with the will to solve the problems in the '90s. We are 
lacking leadership from the business community to solve the major issues. The 
business leaders must stand up and be counted and quit waiting for someone else 
to do the job. The leadership in the development-builders area have tried to do 
their part, but they have acquired a reputation of self-interest that, in my 
opinion, they do not deserve. They have put back into the community and made 
Orange County a better place to live. Just look at the charity donation lists, 
Boy Scouts, etc. They at least have tried to provide leadership from their 
area, even though sadly they have been rejected by the community." 
</P>
<P>
TOP ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
* Drugs 
</P>
<P>
* Political leadership 
</P>
<P>
* Transportation 
</P>
<P>
* Jail facilities 
</P>
<P>
* Revenue for government services 
</P>
<P>
The Most Reverend Norman F. McFarland, Roman Catholic Bishop of Orange 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest single challenge facing Orange County for the 1990s consists in 
changing demographic, economic and social trends having significantly 
unfavorable impact on our families, the basic foundation of our society. No 
agency or program can supplant the family and replace it if it falters." 
</P>
<P>
TOP ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
* Chemical and alcohol abuse and its consequences 
</P>
<P>
* Accessibility to basic health care for all our people 
</P>
<P>
* Abortion and the depth of the moral crisis this manifests 
</P>
<P>
* Availability of affordable housing 
</P>
<P>
* Recognition and assimilation of, and reverence for, true spiritual values 
</P>
<P>
Professor Mark P. Petracca, UCI assistant professor of political science and 
member of various community groups 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the biggest challenge facing Orange County in the 1990s is 
whether we can create and nurture a political system that is up to the task of 
meeting the public policy challenges that lie ahead. The process of governance 
in Orange County and in many localities has not changed much from the days when 
Orange County was far more rural, much less urbane, andsignificantly less 
diverse. Officials in this county and in many localities are trying to govern a 
high-tech economic infrastructure, an increasingly sophisticated and 
emotionally charged electorate, and a socio-economically diverse population 
with "horse and buggy" institutions and politics. The tension between the 
demands on governance and our current capabilities to govern well cannot (and 
should not) be sustained throughout the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Institutional political reforms should be considered (e.g., moving the Board 
of Supervisors to a variant of at-large elections; probably moving some 
at-large city councils to district elections; the increased use of county 
districts to deal with problems that do not mind city boundaries, such as 
pollution, water usage, etc.) as well as changes in our political and 
educational infrastructures (e.g., enhanced use of cable as a mechanism of 
political and general education; increased competition among the local media; 
greater attention to culture as a determinant of daily life)." 
</P>
<P>
TOP ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
* Political reform 
</P>
<P>
* Preservation of the environment 
</P>
<P>
* Greater attention to proximity between workplace and home 
</P>
<P>
* Social values. The "values police" are not going to disappear overnight 
</P>
<P>
* Cultural assimilation 
</P>
<P>
Ray Watson, vice chairman of the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
Biggest challenge: "Rebuilding confidence in government. The horrendous 
problems this county (and others) face -- roads, housing, jails, crime, health 
care, etc. -- will continue to grow until the public (out of desperation) again 
has faith in the only institutions that can deal with these problems. 
Consumerism, Populism, environmentalism, managed growthism, etc. are 
public-awakening but not capable of solving anything." 
</P>
<P>
TOP ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
* Roads 
</P>
<P>
* Housing for middle-class (Poor will be allocated housing, rich always can buy 
in. But with public pressure to retard housing supply, the losers are the 
middle-class.) 
</P>
<P>
* Cost of health care 
</P>
<P>
Tom Mays, mayor of Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
Biggest challenge: "Maintaining our job base in Orange County. Due to an 
increase in traffic congestion, high cost of housing and high labor rates, 
large corporations will be looking outside Southern California, probably in 
other states, to relocate. Young people can not afford Orange County and 
corporations are having a harder time placing people. When jobs start going 
elsewhere, there won't be a housing shortage any longer." 
</P>
<P>
TOP ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
* Quality of life issues 
</P>
<P>
* Jobs 
</P>
<P>
* Traffic 
</P>
<P>
* High cost of housing 
</P>
<P>
* Air quality and other environmental issues 
</P>
<P>
Phillip E. Cox, presiding judge, Orange County Superior Court 
</P>
<P>
"The infrastructure of Orange County is the largest single challenge facing 
Orange County for the 1990s. Orange County has failed, because of lack of 
funds, to keep pace with the needs of the increasing population. At the present 
rate of growth, Orange County citizens may very well see their sewers running 
at capacity or even overflowing, the potholes in the roads will become as big 
as manholes, brownouts may become a reality and one may find that it takes half 
an hour just to have a break in traffic so he can back out of his driveway." 
</P>
<P>
TOP ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
* Drug abuse 
</P>
<P>
* Transportation 
</P>
<P>
* Gangs 
</P>
<P>
* Housing 
</P>
<P>
* Capital improvements -- airport, courts, jails 
</P>
<P>
Donald M. Koll, chairman and chief executive officer, The Koll Company 
</P>
<P>
"Surface transportation will continue to be Orange County's biggest single 
challenge during the 1990s as our population increases from 2.3 million to 2.6 
million and as our job base grows from 1.3 million to 1.6 million. Widening of 
existing freeways and roads, improvement of key interchanges, creation of super 
streets and the addition of the San Joaquin Hills, Foothill and Eastern 
Transportation Corridors will be vital. Our key challenge will be to obtain the 
funds for these mitigation measures." 
</P>
<P>
TOP ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
* Surface transportation 
</P>
<P>
* Affordable housing 
</P>
<P>
* Air quality 
</P>
<P>
* Growth control 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Thomas F. Bradac, producing artistic Director of the Grove Shakespeare 
Festival, Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
"The theater both reflects and comments on society. I believe that violence 
(gang-related, domestic, drug-related and random) will continue to increase in 
our community. The theater, as other agencies and arts organizations, will need 
to address itself to providing opportunities for those who are disenfranchised 
within our society. As an artist, the theater has the ability to communicate 
human hopes and aspirations, to provide thought and reflection, to inspire and 
through reflection to comment on our lives -- to see how violence is affecting 
each one of us." 
</P>
<P>
TOP ISSUES (artistically) 
</P>
<P>
* Government censorship of controversial topics and ideas 
</P>
<P>
* Lack of adequate funding for the arts by government, corporations and 
individuals 
</P>
<P>
* Arts education in the public schools 
</P>
<P>
* Support of artists within the community 
</P>
<P>
* Art as a necessity for society as opposed to a frill 
</P>

Who needs Dasher and Dancer when you've got dashin' and dancin'? 
</P>
<P>
Pilar Wayne's Christmas bash Saturday night may have been low on holiday decor, 
but it was high on holiday style. 
</P>
<P>
Partying gents showed up in everything from avant-garde penguin suits (the 
dashing Ethan Wayne wore his satin-trimmed stunner with a black silk shirt) to 
snazzy sport ensembles embroidered with silk holly (worn by Supervisor Tom 
Riley). 
</P>
<P>
And oh, the women. Aissa Wayne knocked 'em dead in an iridescent sequinned 
zebra print. Her mother, Pilar, appeared first in a full-length cloud of purple 
chiffon decorated with silver discs, and then in a short number smothered in 
bugle beads. Marisa -- Pilar and John Wayne's youngest daughter -- wore a 
strapless black velvet body-hugger trimmed with a fluff of black fox. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about dancin'. Pilar had cleared her Newport Beach living room of 
everything but her grand piano and brought in a parquet dance floor the size of 
most back yards. While a fire roared in a fireplace flanked with gleaming 
crystal sconces, guests danced to favorites with rock 'n' roll and Latin beats. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know mom could dance like that!" said a wide-eyed Marisa, watching 
her glamorous mum execute a cha-cha. 
</P>
<P>
Among guests was Pilar's new puppy, Thor, a Norwegian elkhound (the pup's 
toothy playfulness accounted for some scratches -- hidden by tiny bandages -- 
on his new mistress's forearms). But Pilar's parrot, Gucci, was kept in a cage 
in her ruffly master suite. "You never know what Gucci is going to do when 
other people are around," Pilar said. "I am his alone. When I went to Paris 
last September, I had to call him every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say: 'Hi Gucci! How are you?' and he would say: 'How are you?' He is 
adorable." 
</P>
<P>
Faces in the crowd: author Joseph Wambaugh and his wife, Dee (Wambaugh's new 
book, "The Golden Orange" -- a thriller about a retired Orange County cop -- 
will be published next spring); Peggy and Bob Goldwater; "Love Boat's" Bernie 
Kopell with his wife, Yolanda (daughter of the famous dance team Veloz and 
Yolanda); tennis great Tracy Austin; Lois Aldrin (who, with hubby, Buzz, 
attended Vice President Dan Quayle's Christmas bash in Washington on Monday 
night); Gene and JoAnne Mix (in a slinky black dress and a red, wide-brim hat); 
Vikki Vargas and Mike Nason; Kitty and Jerry Kobrin; Marshall Klein (L.A. Rams 
owner Georgia Frontiere's right arm, who brought Pilar a terry cloth apron 
emblazoned with the words: L.A. Rams Locker Room); Judi and Carmelo Manto; 
Regina McGrath; Claudia Mirkin; Kathy Bryant and Link Mathewson. 
</P>
<P>
The time of their lives: Hundreds of Bill Medley fans brought more than the 
price of admission to Sunday's Righteous Brothers' concert with Jennifer Warnes 
on Sunday at The Hop in Fountain Valley. They brought Christmas toys for Big 
Brothers/Big Sisters of Orange County -- stuffed toys, board games, books, hair 
dryers and perfume. 
</P>
<P>
Seems Medley and Warnes, who became pals after they teamed up to record "The 
Time of My Life" for the movie "Dirty Dancing," have a soft spot for good 
causes. A few weeks ago, they sang together to raise funds for victims of the 
San Francisco-area quake. 
</P>
<P>
Medley took the spotlight first, thrilling the 300-strong crowd with selections 
from his new album, "The Best of Bill Medley" (which included an anthem to 
"American Rock and Roll" written by the lanky singer). Then he introduced 
Warnes, looking demure in a white silk blouse and dark plaid culottes, 
referring to her as "a dear friend," "a cute girl from Mater Dei (the Santa Ana 
high school she attended)," and "an artist who sticks to her art." 
</P>
<P>
Calling Orange County "a land of paradox, a place where, if you try hard, you 
can find some real people at Pup 'n' Taco," Warnes sang two ballads, one about 
a woman longing to find a mate, the other about a cowgirl's longing to attach 
meaning to life. You could have heard a pin drop when Warnes finished her soft 
and soulful ballads, unfamiliar fare in a nightclub that thrives on a diet of 
blaring rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Then came what the crowd had packed into the nightclub for: Medley and Warnes 
teaming up for "Love Lift Us Up Where We Belong" (the mega-hit she recorded 
with Joe Cocker) and Medley and Warnes' millions-selling "The Time of My Life." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Medley accepted a plaque from his daughter-in-law, Lauren Medley, 
who does public relations for Big Brothers/Big Sisters. "We were planning a 
Christmas party for our little brothers and sisters, and we needed toys," said 
Lauren during the show. "So I called my father-in-law, told him my idea, and he 
said, 'Absolutely!' " She's hoping it will become an annual affair. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the show from the sidelines was Jo Alexander, executive director of 
the organization that pairs up single-parent children, ages 6 to 16, with 
helpmates. "Our volunteers give the children an adult role model," Alexander 
said. "A friend they can call their own, sometimes for life." 
</P>
<P>
In the red: "Would you like your eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon or salmon?" 
That was the toughest question guests had to answer Sunday at the 
take-a-break-from-the-holiday-madness brunch staged by the Rex restaurant in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The popular $35-per-person benefit for the local chapter of the American Red 
Cross also featured traditional servings of bubbly and fresh OJ. (Only the 
heavenly straw potatoes -- airy stacks of toothpick-thin spuds -- were missing. 
Chunks of fried red potatoes were served instead). 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds of nearly $10,000 were earmarked for the chapter's local 
disaster-relief fund, said George Chitty, CEO of the local chapter. So far this 
year, the chapter's disaster emergency service volunteers have assisted 148 
families. Donations of food, clothing and shelter have been given to victims of 
fire, flood and high-wind disasters. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more than 225 guests: hosts Susan and Rex Chandler (restaurant owner 
Rex was busy poaching eggs in the kitchen with John Rader); Aissa Wayne with 
Roger Luby; Edna and Bill Blurock (faithful brunch supporters); Lon and Mary 
Ann Wells with table guests Sandi and Dr. Gerald Brodie; Zee Allred, Nora 
Jorgensen, and Anne and Bob Badham; Les and Peggy Cotton; Pat Clevidence; Mary 
Lou and Scott Hornsby; Joe Perricone, and Joe Genova.

IVY LEAGUERS MEET FOR FUN, NONPROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The question asked at the door was, "Ivy League?" 
</P>
<P>
And the answer was simple -- the name of one of the eight Eastern college 
allies, or mention of one of the seven affiliated "sister" schools. 
</P>
<P>
With those passwords -- and a quick glance down the list -- 165 formally 
dressed guests were admitted to the the upstairs dining area of John Dominis 
restaurant on Sunday night. For them, the tendrils of Ivy cling mightily. 
</P>
<P>
The $50-a-pop holiday dinner-dance was hosted by the Ivy League Assn. of 
Southern California, a nonprofit group that organizes educational and social 
events in Los Angeles and Orange County throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to popular belief," said Joseph Villarosa (Yale '84), "most of the 
people in this group are really down-to-earth." 
</P>
<P>
Villarosa, a native New Yorker and president of the alumni association, said 
that he -- like many others in the group -- came to California "for a good job 
and for life-style reasons." He joined ranks with his fellow alums out here 
because he wanted "to network with others who share the same morals, values and 
ethics. Does that sound elitist?" he asked. "I don't mean to sound elitist." 
</P>
<P>
The party got off to a groggy start, thanks in part to the Coast Highway 
traffic clogging the route to the Newport Beach restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, guests settled at dinner tables near windows overlooking the bay, 
where boats trimmed in holiday lights glided between dark sky and black water. 
</P>
<P>
Among the few minglers who stood while they sipped their cocktails were 
University of Pennsylvania ('86) alumni Laura Delgado and Anne-Maree Cantwell. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado, a convention planner, said she and her friend liked going to alumni 
events because "it's wonderful to be with your comrades." 
</P>
<P>
"You always have a lot in common with the people you meet at these (parties)," 
said Cantwell, who lived in London before her recent move to Palos Verdes. "And 
if nothing else, you can always talk about school." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Beimfohr (Cornell '66), who co-hosted the party with Villarosa, talked 
about the scholarship money raised by the different alumni associations, and 
said he likes "having a group you relate to on a different basis from people at 
work, or social groups. I think it's part of being a complete person to have 
yourself invested in more than one area, with more than one group of people." 
</P>
<P>
Julianne Hill (Brown '43) and her husband, Herbert, watched the boat parade 
from a quiet table at one end of the wall of windows. Hill remembered "all 
those years we were living out in the desert, and every year I'd get an 
invitation (to an alumni party) and I could never go. Well, we just moved back 
from the desert," she said, "and here I am at this party!" 
</P>
<P>
Also attending were Joe and Pauline Fontana, Sid and Michelle Turkish, Jack and 
Gail Finnell, Jay and Debbie Gilbert, Tom and Mary Barry, Bill and Joyce 
Zaenglein, and Harry Jeffrey.

COVERAGE OF ALZHEIMER'S EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Mr. Wong: 
</P>
<P>
I am writing to compliment you on the excellent and informative article in the 
Nov. 2, 1989, issue of Orange County Life entitled "Painting the Past." Your 
coverage of the art exhibit of works by Alzheimer's patients was thorough, very 
professional and very much on target. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, called "Memories in the Making '89," is a new and unique idea, one 
which is breaking ground in the areas of patient communication and research. It 
has given those who view the artworks an opportunity to see into the "windows 
on the soul" still alive in the patients devastated by this disease. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you for writing about this event in such a sensitive way. Your coverage 
has allowed us to reach many new individuals who may not have known about us 
and what it is we do for Alzheimer's patients and their families. On behalf of 
the board of directors, I thank you for helping us remember those who no longer 
can remember. 
</P>
<P>
G. Kent Barnheiser, 
</P>
<P>
Executive Director, Alzheimer's Assn.

ASK THE VET: FLEAS VULNERABLE AT LARVAL STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn.

Q I have a 7-year-old mixed Persian cat and for the first time since I got her, 
I noticed this summer that in the droppings that she scratches off onto her 
blanket, there are minute worms, not more than an eighth of an inch long. I've 
checked her stools and there doesn't appear to be any worms there. I'm 
wondering if there is a stage in a flea's life when it is in the form of a 
worm, say between the egg and the hatched flea? Or is there some other 
explanation? I shake out her blanket daily, of course, and wash it every three 
or four days, but these worms make me nervous since it is inevitable that some 
of them will get into the carpet or elsewhere around the house. Please tell me 
what you think they are and how to get rid of them. 
</P>
<P>
Dixie La Shell, 
</P>

</P>
<P>
A What you have described is apparently the larval stage in the life cycle of 
the flea. When a flea lays her eggs, they incubate for approximately a week and 
then hatch into a very small white larval form, which is very active and moves 
about to feed. As this larva feeds, its color will change from white to a brown 
tint. The larvae then molt within a two- to three-week span, and then spin a 
cocoon, which becomes very resistant to environmental changes and insecticide 
products. A new flea can hatch out within a 10-day to two-week period of time, 
ready to feed on your pet or even you. To control this cycle, you must continue 
to clean the environment where your cat stays. Sprays, dips, and baths will 
kill the adult fleas. Premise sprays and foggers can be effective against 
larval stages, as is vacuuming the carpets and floors and washing the bedding. 
Again, the pupal stage is the most resistant form, although good aggressive 
cleaning of the area will help remove them. 
</P>
<P>
If there is still some doubt as to the identity of these worms, take a few to 
your veterinarian and have them examined to make sure that they are flea 
larvae. Tapeworm segments and other insect larva can be confused for flea 
larvae, although tape segments tend to be much larger. 
</P>
<P>
Q My 7-year-old cocker spaniel was born with a cataract and now has another one 
and can't see at all. My problem is I can't afford to have her operated on. Do 
any vets preform this service free or near free? 
</P>
<P>
R. Knauerhaze, 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
A Because cataract surgery is very delicate and requires special care, not only 
for the surgery but also the after-care, I am not aware of any practices that 
do the surgery at no charge. You should talk your situation over with your 
regular veterinarian or with the ophthalmologist who would be doing the 
surgery. Even a referral to the veterinary school at the University of 
California, Davis, would not guarantee surgery at no charge, but they might be 
able to charge part of the cost off to teaching.

CSU TRUSTEE APOLOGIZES IN DEGREE FUROR;

The chairwoman of the California State University Board of Trustees on 
Wednesday issued a formal public apology for misstating her educational 
credentials and offered to meet with a powerful Senate committee next month to 
discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to apologize for any confusion which may have resulted from 
references in my resume to my attendance at Long Beach City College," Marianthi 
Lansdale said in a prepared statement issued Wednesday through the CSU 
chancellor's office. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never my intention to mislead anyone regarding my community college 
record, of which I am quite proud. However, because of questions which have 
been raised, I will be contacting Sen. (David A.) Roberti's office to discuss 
the desirability of meeting with the Senate Rules Committee immediately after 
the first of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tempore Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who chairs the Rules 
Committee, said he is willing to meet with Lansdale, a gubernatorial appointee 
but still believes she should resign. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate the apology, but it strikes me that the misinformation was 
carefully crafted," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Tuesday that Lansdale, 57, a Huntington Beach resident who 
has been active in Orange County cultural affairs, misstated her educational 
credentials when she listed an Associate of Arts degree in literature from Long 
Beach City College in 1959. She gave the information to Gov. George 
Deukmejian's office when she was being considered for a gubernatorial 
appointment to the board in 1985. The false information then was forwarded to 
the Senate for her confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
However, college records show that Lansdale attended the school for 13 
semesters between 1957 and 1967. And she conceded Tuesday that she never 
received her degree. 
</P>
<P>
In her statement on Wednesday, Lansdale said she attended the college "at night 
over a number of years while working full time and raising a child. During that 
time, I amassed a considerable number of academic units in anticipation of 
transferring to a four-year university and pursuing my baccalaureate degree." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Deukmejian, who received more than $100,000 in contributions 
from Lansdale and her husband during his 1982 gubernatorial race, said the 
governor had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
As chairwoman, Lansdale heads a 24-member board that makes policy decisions for 
one of the largest public four-year university systems in the world. 
</P>
<P>
There are no educational requirements for the politically appointed positions. 
Lansdale is one of three members who do not report at least a baccalaureate 
degree in their educational background, according to Stephen J. MacCarthy, 
director of public affairs for the CSU chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
The other two are Roland E. Arnall, the chairman and chief executive officer of 
Long Beach Savings, and Willie J. Stennis, founder and president of the Golden 
Bird fast-food chicken chain. 
</P>
<P>
A number of trustees contacted Wednesday said they disagreed with Roberti's 
call for Lansdale to resign, saying they are willing to overlook the 
misrepresentations because she has served well on the board. Lansdale has 
prompted the CSU board to pay more attention to child care on campus and 
including greater numbers of women in affirmative action hiring programs. 
</P>
<P>
"She's an outstanding chair, she's an outstanding success story and she ought 
to be judged on what she accomplished during her tenure on the board," said 
Vice Chairman William D. (Denny) Campbell, a Laguna Beach attorney. 
</P>
<P>
But one trustee -- Lee Grissom of San Diego -- said the revelations were 
"embarrassing" and that the trustees have "no choice" but to question Lansdale 
at the next trustee meeting Jan. 9-10 in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is something that happened, I would like to know more about it," said 
Grissom, president of the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce. "We are the 
(degree) granting agency for 20 universities in this state, and I think there's 
a place where you have to make sure that everything is correct, otherwise your 
integrity is diminished. 
</P>
<P>
"If all the bad things are right, I would suspect she would probably say, 
'Maybe it's time for me to step aside,' " said Grissom. "But if she has a 
defense for it -- and I hope to God she does -- then we don't have to do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said Wednesday that, despite reports on Lansdale's accomplishments as 
board chairwoman, he is still disturbed by the fact that she supplied 
inaccurate information to the Rules Committee, which unanimously confirmed her 
during a brief March 1986 hearing before sending her name to the full Senate 
for concurrence. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti, who called on Tuesday for Lansdale to step down, said he still feels 
she should resign. 
</P>
<P>
"That's still my feeling, but in all fairness, I would like to talk to her," 
said Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale could not be reached for further comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, Long Beach developer William M. (Bit) Lansdale, have 
contributed time and money to such Orange County cultural institutions as the 
Performing Arts Center and the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana. They have also been 
longtime activists for the Long Beach symphony and the Long Beach Civic Light 
Opera.

Larry Mahoney was convicted today of 27 counts of second-degree manslaughter 
and most of the other charges he faced in the nation's deadliest 
alcohol-related traffic crash, which claimed the lives of 27 people riding home 
from a church outing. 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney bowed his head slightly as the verdict was read on each count he faced 
from the fiery crash May 14, 1988. Mahoney, 36, was charged with 27 counts of 
murder, 12 of first-degree assault, 42 of wanton endangerment and one of 
drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors were to consider a sentence later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney was driving his pickup in the wrong direction on Interstate 71 near 
Carrollton, when it rammed head-on into a bus, killing 24 children and three 
adults who belonged to the Radcliff First Assembly of God church. Mahoney's 
lawyers said he admitted being drunk and driving north in the southbound lanes 
of the divided highway.

A Tarzana man has been arrested for allegedly operating a small business that 
supplied hundreds of phony identification cards to underage students from 
across the country, the Los Angeles police reported this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Sturm, 52, was arrested at 10 p.m. Wednesday on suspicion of forgery of 
government seals. He was released on $1,000 bail this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Sturm was arrested after two young-looking, rookie female police officers 
posing as minors went to his tiny office in the corner of a Reseda shopping 
strip and asked for fake IDs that would show them to be over 21 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Richard Ackerman of the West Valley vice squad said there were 10 other 
underaged youths waiting in line for phony ID cards. 
</P>
<P>
Sturm was arrested after providing each police officer with two cards, one for 
a state and one for a university. Ackerman said the photo IDs, complete with 
false birth dates, looked legitimate and even carried state seals on them. 
</P>
<P>
Police seized records that indicated Sturm had made at least $60,000 this year 
making phony identification cards, for which customers were charged $50 each, 
Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was begun after Ventura police told local officers about 
phony ID cards taken from students in that city.

<P>
Relatives of the dead of Pan Am Flight 103 mourned on two continents today for 
the 270 people killed exactly a year ago by a bomb that blew the plane out of 
the sky and sent flaming wreckage raining onto tiny Lockerbie. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 people -- local residents and relatives of U.S. victims -- gathered 
in a rain falling from leaden skies for a service at Lockerbie's Dryfesdale 
Cemetery on the first anniversary of the Dec. 21, 1988, disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was blown apart by a terrorist bomb at 30,000 feet, showering the 
Scottish border town with liquid fire and pieces of aircraft. All 259 people 
aboard the plane -- many of them going home for the holidays -- and 11 people 
on the ground were killed in Britain's worst air disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Mourners, their eyes brimming with tears, also marched in New York City in 
memory of Flight 103. Hope Asrelsky of Manhattan lost her daughter Rachel, 21, 
in the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"She was coming home for Christmas, and like all of them she didn't make it," 
Asrelsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas will continue to be a hard time," she said, her voice cracking. "Our 
lives have changed, totally changed. We lost an important person. All of us 
have. Every last one. These weren't worthless people. They were the very best 
people that were taken." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Pan American World Airways, which today placed notices 
mourning the dead in international newspapers, attended the service at the 
Lockerbie cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
But the chairman of the group representing British Lockerbie victims, Jim 
Swire, stayed away. Swire, who lost his daughter in the disaster, said he was 
too upset to attend. 
</P>
<P>
More mourners and sympathizers were expected to jam Lockerbie streets for an 
evening memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am held its own services today at London's Heathrow Airport, West Germany's 
Frankfurt Airport and New York's Kennedy Airport. The airline flew its flags at 
half-staff all day. 
</P>
<P>
The mourners in Manhattan marched through icy winds and a light snow to a vigil 
at the Pan Am Building on Park Avenue, clutching red tulips and carrying 
placards that read: "When will we take a stand against terrorism?" 
</P>
<P>
"I want to know why this terrorist act that could have been so easily 
preventable wasn't preventable," said Mary Ellen DeSantis, whose 25-year-old 
nephew was killed.

Foreign Ministry officials today told American Jewish leaders attending the 
first national congress of Soviet Jews in nearly 70 years that most of the 
country's estimated 100 remaining refuseniks will be allowed to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Wenick, executive director of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, 
said the news about the refuseniks, Jews repeatedly refused permission to 
emigrate, came from Anatoly Adamishin, a deputy foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
Adamishin told Wenick and other representatives of the American group that a 
"substantial" number of the refuseniks who had been barred from emigrating 
because of access to state secrets will soon be told they can leave. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat who closely follows the refusenik issue said he heard the 
same report but cautioned that the Soviets had not officially notified the 
refuseniks. "We hope it's true, but let's wait and see," said the diplomat.

A strike that has virtually paralyzed the distribution of newspapers in Paris 
for a week turned violent today when pickets clashed with non-strikers. 
</P>
<P>
The Parisian Newspaper Distributors said four non-strikers were injured when 
strikers attacked them with iron bars as the workers packed newspapers into 
delivery trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Talks between newspaper owners and strikers demanding a pay increase were due 
to begin this afternoon as newspapers said their existence was being threatened 
by the week-old strike. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has kept almost all Parisian newspapers, including the Paris-based 
International Herald Tribune, off the streets. Almost all French newspapers are 
sold on the streets, with very few home delivered.

The Panama Canal, closed Wednesday for the first time in its 75-year history 
for reasons other than natural causes after U.S. troops invaded Panama, was 
reopened today to limited daylight traffic only, the Panama Canal Commission 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen or more vessels are expected to pass through the strategic 
Atlantic-Pacific waterway today, the commission said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Normal 24-hour passage of ships through the canal is expected by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission temporarily suspended service at 1 a.m. on Wednesday due to 
concern for the safety of vessels and canal employees in the area during U.S. 
military activities in the area," the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush ordered thousands of U.S. troops into Panama early Wednesday, 
forcing Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to flee into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said: "Initially service will be limited to daylight hours with 
a dozen or more vessels scheduled to pass through the waterway on Thursday," it 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is anticipated that the canal will return to normal 24-hour operations 
by the weekend," it said.

The average price for imports increased slightly from October to November while 
the price of exports fell, the Labor Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said import prices increased 0.3%, 
the third consecutive monthly gain, while export prices slipped 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in import prices was led by more expensive capital and consumer 
goods. Capital goods increased 0.5% in price in October after slipping in the 
previous two months. The price of imported consumer goods rose 0.9% in October. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly slip in export prices, which followed two consecutive monthly 
increases, reflected declines in agricultural and non-agricultural prices, the 
department said.

An ABC News producer taken hostage in Panama said he was held in a Panamanian 
army intelligence headquarters, where he was "threatened constantly" but 
released. 
</P>
<P>
The producer, Robert Campos, said Wednesday night he was abducted at the Panama 
City Marriott Hotel with four other Americans, and that to his knowledge none 
of the others had been released. CBS producer Jon Meyersohn and an American 
businessman staying at the Marriott were separated from Campos and a Colombian 
national after their abduction, Campos said by telephone on ABC-TV's 
"Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
CBS said it had received no word of Meyersohn's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
"A group of us were on the mezzanine level of the hotel when we saw the 
'Dignity Battalion' soldiers entering the hotel from the lower level," he said, 
referring to Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's staunchly loyal paramilitary force. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to run away by taking an elevator up to a higher floor and when the 
elevator doors opened, two soldiers leveled their AK-47s at us. We again tried 
to run but they said that they would kill us if we did. They laid us on the 
floor and took us off in a pickup truck." 
</P>
<P>
Campos said they were taken to an army intelligence headquarters near downtown 
Panama City, about a mile from the military headquarters. About 75 people were 
at the building, all armed, mostly with AK-47s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were threatened constantly," Campos said. "We were told that many 
Panamanians were dying because of this invasion and that we would pay. This 
Colombian gentleman spoke up and said he had a wife and a daughter to worry 
about and one of the soldiers told him, 'If I feel like it, I'll make sure you 
never see them for Christmas.' " 
</P>
<P>
Campos was held nearly six hours before being released, said Laura Wessner, a 
spokeswoman for ABC News.

DAUGHTER WINS SOLE TITLE TO $100-MILLION PRESLEY ESTATE

Elvis Presley's $100-million estate has been turned over to his daughter and 
sole heir after more than a decade of legal disputes, including a woman's claim 
to be The King's illegitimate daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The estate will continue to be managed for Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie, by a 
trust until 1998. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Probate Judge Joseph Evans returned to the bench briefly Wednesday to 
sign the final order, which had been held up by a young woman's claim as 
Presley's illegitimate daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Evans denied the claim in 1988 on grounds of insufficient evidence, and appeals 
courts upheld the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Presley, "the king of rock 'n' roll," died at his Graceland mansion in Memphis 
in 1977. His estate has been managed in trust for Lisa Marie Presley, who turns 
22 in February. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Presley would have taken sole control of the estate at 25, according to 
her father's will, but last year she agreed to extend the trust until 1998. 
Miss Presley's mother, Priscilla Presley, was divorced from her father when he 
died. 
</P>
<P>
The estate was valued at $5 million to $7 million at Presley's death. The trust 
opened Presley's mansion to tourists in 1982, and the estate also draws 
royalties from his recordings and controls use of his name and image.

Author Norman Mailer is upset about a line in the new one-man Broadway play 
"Tru" that alludes to a 29-year-old incident in which the writer allegedly 
stabbed his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Mailer said in a letter to co-producer Lewis Allen that the reference was "kind 
of crass," according to today's editions of the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an ugly line designed to cater to rich out-of-town yahoos," Mailer wrote 
to Allen, who also is husband of the playwright, Jay Presson Allen. 
</P>
<P>
The line that irked Mailer is spoken in the first act by the Truman Capote 
character, who is worried about his popularity in 1975 after a story of his was 
published in Esquire magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Capote, played by Robert Morse, is talking on the telephone and tells his 
lecture agent's secretary: 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, hon. When Irene gets back in, ask her when Norman Mailer stabbed his 
wife, how much his fee went up." 
</P>
<P>
The line refers to when Mailer allegedly stabbed his second wife, Adele 
Morales, with a penknife after an all-night party at his Manhattan apartment in 
November, 1960. She declined to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
In reply, Lewis Allen wrote Mailer: "A pretty poor show, kid, for someone who 
over three decades has assiduously worked at creating the very public image of 
a provocateur, a tough guy who takes on all comers, a mythic brawler. 
</P>
<P>
"But when a small shot comes your way, you toss your curls and sob 'foul.' "

Jack Nicholson concedes he's never been Hollywood's top box office attraction, 
but he says, "That's all by design." 
</P>
<P>
"I like being in that second or third spot," the actor, who stands to make $60 
million for his role in "Batman," said in January's issue of Gentleman's 
Quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
"Just let some other lunatic do this stuff and move up behind him, and nobody 
gets too excited about it," Nicholson said. "I've had creative autonomy from 
'Easy Rider' on, with a few exceptions, and that's all you get out of being the 
Number One box office star anyway."

Jennifer Casolo wants to make the most of her imprisonment in a Salvadoran jail 
by going on the lecture circuit. Casolo, 28, speaking Tuesday night at a church 
service in her hometown of Thomaston, Conn., says she plans to hit 10 to 12 
cities after the holidays to talk about the plight of the Salvadoran people. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo, who was freed after being imprisoned 17 days on charges of abetting 
communist rebels, said she hopes her time in the limelight will end so that she 
can go about her work and carry her message to the people. "I don't want to be 
Jennifer Casolo," she said. "I want to be someone who witnessed the pain and 
suffering in El Salvador. I don't want to be special." One person she plans to 
speak to is Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), who was instrumental in 
securing her release. She wants him to reverse his position and call for an end 
to U.S. military aid to El Salvador.

"OBVIOUSLY BURNING a movie star in effigy is an act that works for people 
psychologically. . . . My reaction (to the rumor that she has AIDS) was to try 
and investigate it, to try and understand how such a thing that made no sense 
at all could come into existence. And a very effective existence. It was 
printed in the newspapers and confirmed in medical circles. . . . I was at the 
mercy of the nastiest imaginations. It taught me one thing: that the saying 
'there's no smoke without fire' is false. . . . I was relieved to be reported 
dead; it's true. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
This is the French actress Isabelle Adjani, talking to reporter Marilyn Goldin 
in the new issue of Interview. Let's add for the record that Adjani does NOT 
have acquired immune deficiency syndrome and is very much alive and kicking. 
</P>
<P>
I THOUGHT of her remarks the other morning when speaking with Carroll O'Connor, 
who was in his "In the Heat of the Night" production offices in Georgia. 
Carroll is one of the great men of television; his "All in the Family" has made 
him practically immortal. And his present TV series, about a white Mississippi 
sheriff who works hand-in-glove with a black detective, is a big hit. It boasts 
wonderful writing and acting. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll spoke in his usual cultured, measured and dispassionate manner. (He 
doesn't sound a bit like Archie Bunker.) We spoke of the National Enquirer 
story that said Carroll's co-star, Howard Rollins, had been fired from the show 
by Carroll and that Rollins is suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor: "These papers are typical. They are so vile. They never bother to 
verify anything with us because if they called, that would kill the story 
they've made up. This is a pathogenic piece of journalism. It should be 
sickening to the American people to have to read this thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard has been sick. But we never felt he'd have to leave the show. We still 
don't think so. We had the screen tests of the five other actors who tested 
with Howard before the series began. We knew we could fall back on some of 
them. And we'd reached the conclusion that if Howard was too ill to go on now, 
we'd get someone on an option basis and he'd step out whenever Howard came 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I may be the executive producer of this show, but I don't have the RIGHT 
to fire anybody. And I never fired Howard, or asked that he be fired. He is 
still under contract. Only the studio could let him go. So the paper lied when 
they say he was fired . . . they lied when they say I fired him . . . they lied 
when they quoted me as calling Howard 'a bad apple.' My wife and I love Howard; 
we have been with him all the way in his recovery from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We did five episodes of the show without Howard; writing him out to say he was 
away on business. Anne Murray Johnson, who plays his wife, has been in these 
episodes. I expect Howard to be back at work on Jan. 2. You know, at first I 
thought I might sue the Enquirer for $20 million. Now I think we're going to 
sue for $100 million!" 
</P>
<P>
ROLLINS' AGENT, Michael Thomas of New York, says his client is going to 
Baltimore to spend Christmas with his mother. He already sent her a honey-baked 
ham from the South. "Howard sounds wonderful on the phone, and these reports 
that he is 'suicidal' are just not true. He will report for work on Jan. 2. I'm 
not a doctor, but I don't believe that Howard has tested HIV-positive for AIDS; 
those tales are not true either."

American actor and bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger today accepted damages and 
an apology from a British newspaper that had alleged he held fervent Nazi views 
and was a secret admirer of Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Austrian-born Schwarzenegger, whose hit films include "Conan the Barbarian" and 
"Terminator," sued The News of the World over an article last February entitled 
"Hollywood Star's Nazi Secret." 
</P>
<P>
Schwarzenegger's lawyer James Price told a judge that News Group Newspapers, 
the publishers, now accepted there was no truth in the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to paying undisclosed damages and legal costs, the company also 
agreed in the out-of-court settlement never to repeat the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Clinton, representing the News of the World, said the paper deeply 
regretted the damage and distress caused. 
</P>
<P>
"My clients accept that Mr. Schwarzenegger has never espoused Nazi and 
anti-Semitic views and has never been an admirer of Adolf Hitler and what he 
and his evil regime represent," he said.

Ron McBride, a 50-year-old coaching veteran serving as an Arizona assistant, 
says he has been chosen to take the helm of the University of Utah football 
program. 
</P>
<P>
McBride, an assistant coach for 26 years -- including stints at Utah from 1977 
to '82 and in 1985 and '86 -- replaces Jim Fassel, who was fired last month. 
McBride will be Utah's 15th head football coach. 
</P>
<P>
University officials planned a formal announcement at a mid-afternoon news 
conference. However, McBride confirmed he had been told he had the job. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a job I've always wanted," McBride said. "It's a great time to go there. 
They haven't played very good defense for the last several years, and it's just 
a great opportunity for me. I think it's a great job." 
</P>
<P>
Washington assistant Keith Gilbertson was the runner-up. He and McBride visited 
the Utah campus for interviews earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
McBride joined the Arizona staff in 1987 as offensive line coach, when Dick 
Tomey took over for Larry Smith as head coach. Before Arizona, he had served as 
an assistant at Utah, Wisconsin, Cal State Long Beach, San Jose State and UC 
Riverside.

'NAKED RACISM' THREATENS SOCCER CLUB; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: TEAM MAY BE SOLD OR DISBANDED. IT HAS BEEN BANNED FROM HOME 
STADIUM BECAUSE PRETORIA OFFICIALS DO NOT WANT CROWD OF BLACK FANS.

<P>
A leading professional soccer club is for sale and may disband because it is 
barred from the main stadium in its home of Pretoria. Team officials say the 
all-white City Council does not want big crowds of black fans. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of Arcadia are white, as are most of its players, but it has 
competed successfully since 1976 in the National Soccer League. An overwhelming 
majority of the league's players and fans are black. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia has been barred from Caledonian Stadium in central Pretoria since 1981 
when the City Council said there was too much unruliness among fans at 
multiracial pro games. 
</P>
<P>
The club's lease on a smaller stadium expired when the 1989 season ended last 
month, and it appealed to the City Council to lift the ban for next season. The 
answer was "no," and Arcadia chairman Saul Sacks this week announced that the 
team was for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Local soccer writers have speculated that the sale may never materialize, and 
that Arcadia's top three or four players will be sold for high transfer fees 
while the rest of the team disbands. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disgrace that a club should be sold because it cannot use its home 
ground," said Arcadia Coach Dave Barber. "The government is busy telling the 
world how it's changing, but this naked racism remains, right in its capital 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul Bhamjee, chief spokesman for the National Soccer League, urged Arcadia to 
remain intact and said the league would schedule games at Caledonian next 
season as an act of defiance against the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"We would openly dare the City Council to throw us out, with the whole world 
watching," Bhamjee said. 
</P>
<P>
Cor Uys, a leading council member, today denounced newspapers that reported 
Bhamjee's "subversive call on Arcadia to defy the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
"Anarchy cannot and will not be tolerated," Uys said.

BIG 10-BOUND PENN STATE GETS PINK SLIP

<P>
Big Ten-bound Penn State has been sent a letter by Atlantic 10 officials 
suggesting the school leave the conference by June 30, the Pittsburgh Press 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached Wednesday in a telephone conference call involving the 
athletic directors of nine of the 10 conference schools, the newspaper 
reported. Penn State, which announced Tuesday it would join the Big Ten, 
declined to participate in the call. 
</P>
<P>
The Providence Journal-Bulletin reported today that Rhode Island Athletic 
Director McKinley Boston told Commissioner Ron Bertovich to tell Penn State to 
sever its ties with the Atlantic 10 after this season. 
</P>
<P>
"The conference does not support their lame-duck status," Boston said. "We are 
100% against it. If they are leaving, they should just go. Basically, they 
should be through when their commitment to us runs out on June 30." 
</P>
<P>
Penn State has said it intends to remain in the Atlantic 10 through the 1990-91 
season, but Atlantic 10 Commissioner Bertovich, who is currently negotiating 
future television contracts, also said he does not like the Nittany Lions' 
lame-duck status. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State President Bryce Jordan has declined to reveal the school's plans 
concerning the Atlantic 10, saying, "I just wouldn't be interested in 
commenting until I saw the letter." 
</P>
<P>
Should Penn State inform each Atlantic 10 member of its withdrawal by Dec. 31, 
it can leave the league as of June 30. If Penn State waits until June 30, it 
will have to wait until June 30, 1991, or 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State could conceivably begin competing in some Big Ten sports next fall, 
although it cannot start playing conference teams in basketball until at least 
the 1991-92 season. It expects to begin competing in football in the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Some Big Ten schools are booked through 1998.

A disagreement over racing schedules has caused Charles Town Races officials to 
suspend their thoroughbred racing program and lay off 1,100 workers effective 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Track General Manager Donald Hudson on Wednesday blamed the move on a decision 
by the West Virginia Racing Commission to restrict the number of races the 
track could run daily in 1990 and the size of the purses. 
</P>
<P>
"Horsemen will be notified that all stall spaces must be vacated immediately," 
a race track news release said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Burke, chairman of the state racing commission, said the dispute between 
track owners and the Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn. centers on the 
number of racing days per week and the size of the purses paid to the members 
of the horsemen's association. 
</P>
<P>
Burke said that the association wants 44 races a week and that track owners 
want 51 races a week.

COURT REFUSES TO REINSTATE HIALEAH LICENSE

<TEXT>
<P>
A state appeals court today refused to reinstate Hialeah Park's pari-mutuel 
license, which was suspended after the track changed its racing schedule 
without permission. 
</P>
<P>
The 1st District Court of Appeal declined to lift the suspension ordered by the 
Department of Business Regulation. That means the track will be closed until at 
least Jan. 3, when a full state hearing is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"They are shut down," said Pete Butler, spokesman for DBR. "If they open up, 
it's a criminal misdemeanor." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the financially troubled South Florida thoroughbred track announced 
it would operate three days a week rather than the six days a week required 
under its license. 
</P>
<P>
The change was an attempt to alleviate losses averaging $68,000 a day since the 
track began its season Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Butler said the DBR's Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering requires tracks to 
adhere to the schedules they set at the beginning of the year. If tracks were 
allowed to change at will, the result would be regulatory chaos, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A state administrative officer in Miami will consider whether Hialeah can make 
the change after the January hearing, Butler said.
