<TEXT>
<P>
Justin Allen (Al) Epstein, a 28-year Newport Beach police officer who received 
numerous letters of commendation over the years, died of leukemia Sunday at age 
63 at Hoag Hospital, the police department announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Epstein started on the force in 1953 as a patrol officer and later worked as a 
detective in the burglary and narcotics sections. But a department spokesman 
said he is best remembered for his long hours of effort in the vice and 
intelligence section, where he served eight years until his retirement in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
He won Officer of the Year honors in 1967. Then-Chief James Glavas lauded him, 
saying, "I know of no one in this department . . . who has exhibited more 
dedication and more enthusiasm for their work." 
</P>
<P>
Services will be conducted at 1 p.m. Sunday at Mount Sinai Mortuary and 
Memorial Park, 5950 Forest Lawn Drive in Los Angeles.

I am sorry that Rodolfo F. Acuna is dissatisfied with the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's efforts to serve its Latino students ("Schools Fail Latinos 
in Any Tongue," Opinion, Dec. 10). What would he have us, the classroom 
teachers, do? 
</P>
<P>
As a Caucasian teacher whose students are nearly all Latinos, I cannot be the 
Latina role model which Acuna prefers. I can be a good teacher. I love and 
respect my students; I expect them to succeed and direct my efforts to 
motivating them toward excellence. My colleagues do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Acuna cites many statistics, but fails to explain why Latino youngsters often 
choose not to complete their educations, and choose not to become teachers. I 
reiterate: choose. After all, motivation must come not only from teachers, but 
also from students. Latinos, like others, must choose to succeed.

CHURCH POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now we have heard everything: a church based on a market study! That's the way 
things are with the Willow Creek Church in a Chicago suburb and its minister, 
Bill Hybels (Part A, Dec. 11). 
</P>
<P>
There's no denying the dismal truth in some of the things their door-to-door 
survey underscored as people were asked what they didn't like about 
churchgoing: dullness, boredom, no color or excitement, irrelevance. But the 
response to all of that by a minister and a people who, reportedly, take the 
Bible in utter seriousness, is preposterous and incredible. How comfortable it 
must be to know that in worshiping God you'll not be disturbed by things you'd 
rather not hear about! 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if Mr. Hybels has ever preached a sermon on Isaiah 55:8, "My thoughts 
are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, says the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
It poses some interesting speculation about Jesus' ministry. Presumably, he 
would have had greater success and not ended up on a cross had he conducted his 
own marketing study and shaped his message on what people told him they'd like 
to hear. 
</P>
<P>
The good people of the Willow Creek Church are, I am sure, quite happy and 
contented, as well as their enterprising minister. What concerns me is the 
improbability of their lives ever being probed in any depth. 
</P>
<P>
For without the word of God cutting cross the grain of their lives, like a 
two-edged sword, they can know very little about the awesome mystery of God's 
grace.

BAD TRASH MAKES GOOD POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The subject, trash, may seem prosaic. But the Los Angeles City Council's 
unanimous approval Wednesday of the nation's largest mandatory trash recycling 
program easily stands as a landmark in Southern California's recycling history. 
</P>
<P>
In the nearly 30 years since Sam Yorty was elected mayor of Los Angeles, mainly 
on the strength of his opposition to curbside trash separation, elected 
officials throughout the region have been fearful of fooling with people's 
garbage. But, as this week's vote demonstrates, there has been a change of 
heart. To some extent, this shift is a recognition of the undeniable fact that 
California as a whole is running out of landfills in which to bury its solid 
waste. It was that reality that lead the last session of the Legislature to 
create a full-time state solid waste management board with broad powers to cut 
California's trash in half by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
More important, the public has changed its mind. In fact, 90% of the Southern 
Californians surveyed in a recent Times Poll endorsed recycling. Pilot trash 
separation programs in Los Angeles and San Diego have enjoyed remarkable levels 
of voluntary participation. Smaller communities, such as Santa Monica, 
Pasadena, Burbank and Glendale already have successful recycling programs in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Under Los Angeles' approach, which will be phased in over three years, each of 
the city's 720,000 single-family households will be given a 16-gallon bin for 
cans and bottles and a 90-gallon container for other refuse. Newspapers are to 
be tied and placed on top of the bins at curbside. A separate program is to be 
developed for the private trash haulers who serve businesses and apartment 
buildings with more than four units. 
</P>
<P>
When Yorty was elected in 1961, a majority of Southern Californians viewed the 
prospect of having to separate their refuse as a nuisance. Today, most people 
see trash separation as an act of conscience -- an important and necessary 
admission that material affluence brings responsibility as well as ease and 
that we no longer can live heedlessly on this land.

Rep. Henry Waxman's article "A Catastrophic Attempt to Do Better" (Op-Ed Page, 
Dec. 10) is probably the best statement to come out of Congress on this entire 
sorry subject. The only thing that it lacked was a recognition of the fact that 
the opposition to the 1988 Medicare Catastrophic Law was based on a feeling by 
the entire senior community that the improvements the act contained had such a 
high price tag that any further changes to include more needed coverage would 
be unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
Repeal left many seniors with the frustrated feeling that the main hopes they 
championed for a comprehensive national health care system for all had been set 
back, that those in Congress who were willing to support legislation moving in 
that direction were now discouraged and slow to embrace any new initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman's forward looking article was most important in pointing to the need for 
resuming the drive to solve the problem of providing health care for everyone. 
To do nothing means that the system will disintegrate further with higher 
charges, more uninsured, and the closing of health facilities. This country now 
spends enough on health care to do the job; what is needed is the 
reorganization of the system so that the money is properly spent. 
</P>
<P>
People should let their representatives in Washington know that we want them to 
try again.

I'm an urban education specialist and have published extensively in the field. 
I also train urban school teachers. Acuna's article is yet another example of a 
single-issue educator perpetuating his vested interest. I agree that schools 
fail Latinos in any tongue. Schools generally fail most students. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the fact that more blacks drop out of school than Latinos; forget the 
fact that bilingual students drop out at the same or higher rates than most 
students; forget the fact that bilingual education reinforces segregation in 
public schools; or forget the fact that numerous reports show that bilingual 
education just doesn't work for many. Coping with our dismal public school 
system cannot be easily translated into one self-serving issue, bilingual 
education. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of motivation to complete one's education is not exclusively an issue for 
bilingual education, as some would have us believe. Lack of motivation, 
pervasive in all urban public education, is not the restrictive property of the 
bilingual education lobby who wishes to sell the fashionable one-issue 
standards. The failure of public schooling to meet the needs of the many is far 
more complex than offering simplistic solutions for complex problems.

Acuna makes a valid point in saying that the needs of Latino students are 
neglected in the LAUSD. But to characterize "bilingual education" as inherently 
good simply because it is targeted at Latinos, and to characterize LEAD 
(Learning English Advocates Drive) as "English-only," indicates a lack of 
research into both subjects. 
</P>
<P>
The LAUSD's Bilingual Master Plan is neither a format for learning English, nor 
a true "bilingual" program, but a monolingual Spanish program. Under the new 
plan, most Latino students are taught in Spanish for all but 20 minutes of the 
day, and can graduate high school without ever demonstrating proficiency in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
LEAD, a nonprofit organization of concerned teachers, parents and education 
experts across the country, is dedicated to reforming -- not eliminating -- 
bilingual education by emphasizing modern English language development 
techniques. Not only does LEAD recommend that the native tongue of non-English 
speaking children be used to clarify difficult new words and concepts, whenever 
possible and appropriate, as English is being learned, it actively promotes 
foreign language study for monolingual English-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, no officer of LEAD ever made the statements Acuna attributed to it. 
For what it's worth, I am bilingual, and I never learned a second language by 
being taught exclusively in English. 
</P>
<P>
Acuna neglects to mention national surveys which indicate that 80% of Latino 
parents of limited-English speaking children believe bilingual program emphasis 
should be placed on teaching English. 
</P>
<P>
The days of sink-or-swim can never be allowed to return, but neither should 
Latino children be abandoned in an institutionalized underclass simply because 
of an inability to communicate effectively in English upon entering the 
American public education system. The real civil rights travesty is to deny 
children the tools they will need to function in our nation's 96% 
English-speaking business community.

THERE WILL BE A PRICE TO PAY, BUT BY NOW THIS WAR COULDN'T BE HELPED

It is important to know where this war came from: a deadly combination of law 
and metaphor. In the longest view of American national interests, Manuel 
Noriega was at most an irritant. From the perspective of two years ago when 
this process started, his removal from office was worth not one American life. 
</P>
<P>
By this week, however, events had altered the calculation. At the end of the 
day, for better or worse, George Bush had no choice but to do what he did. Once 
the leader of Panama had declared his country to be in a state of war with the 
United States, once he encouraged his soldiers to harass and shoot Americans in 
Panama, the U.S. position was becoming untenable. We either had get rid of 
Noriega or get out of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The way to do it was as part of a coup, like the failed October coup. Not for 
legal or face-saving reasons, but because that would have given us a base on 
which to build a new regime. In October, the United States could have joined 
one side of a divided Panamanian army. By Wednesday, it had to defeat the 
entire Panamanian Defense Force. 
</P>
<P>
Short-term victory is clearly at hand. But the long-term consequences of having 
done it this way will be damaging. Panama is important to us for its canal. 
That canal has to be defended by a Panamanian army. That Panamanian army has 
therefore to see its main mission as defending a vital U.S. interest. How to 
ask that of an army you have just flattened? 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, by Wednesday, it could not be helped. There was no other way. It 
is hard to believe in 1989, a year in which four totalitarian regimes, highly 
disciplined and institutionalized, have been overthrown without a single loss 
of life, that force still has its uses. It does. Unlike the alien puppet rulers 
imposed on Eastern Europe, tyrants that do not first lose faith in their own 
right to rule respond only to the gun. And since tyrants will always be with 
us, it will be important for the United States to retain its guns long after 
the Soviet empire is a memory.

ARE THERE RULES JUST FOR US?; 
</P>
<P>
PANAMA: DOES ANY NATION HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE UNILATERALLY TO DISPATCH ITS 
FORCES TO REMOVE A FOREIGN LEADER, HOWEVER ODIOUS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABRAHAM F. LOWENTHAL, Abraham F. Lowenthal is a professor of international 
relations at USC and executive director of InterAmerican Dialogue. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under what circumstances, if any, does one nation have the right to decide who 
should govern in another -- and to use its military force to strip power from 
an undesirable foreign leader? 
</P>
<P>
This is the heart of the matter in Panama, because the four reasons initially 
advanced by the White House to justify U.S. military intervention really boil 
down to one -- the determination to remove Gen. Manuel A. Noriega from office. 
</P>
<P>
It is specious to suggest that American armed forces can bring democracy to 
Panama (Administration reason No. 1). It will take much more than the removal 
of a strongman and his cronies to build the institutions and habits that make 
democracy possible. In any case, there is simply no provision in international 
law that allows one nation to dispatch troops to another with the mission of 
imposing democracy. 
</P>
<P>
It is equally spurious to argue that the threat to American lives in Panama 
(Administration reason No. 2) was great enough to warrant the use of 24,000 
troops, the deaths and injuries of hundreds of people and the breakup of the 
structure of the local armed forces and police. At least until last weekend, 
American citizens lived and worked in Panama without intolerable risk. The 
isolated incidents that occurred then, and that are now being used to justify 
U.S. military action, were more a result than a cause of Washington's 
determination to oust Noriega from power. In any case, there were obviously 
many other ways, short of armed force, to reduce or remove the risks to those 
U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
It is ludicrous to contend that the integrity of the Panama Canal treaties can 
be preserved (Administration reason No. 3) by grossly violating its central 
provisions concerning the use of force. The United States cannot credibly argue 
that there was a threat to the canal's functioning requiring the destruction of 
the Panama Defense Forces. Indeed, when the dust settles, Washington will no 
doubt understand that its action will greatly complicate U.S. relations not 
only with Panama, but also with all countries in which the United States wishes 
to maintain military and naval bases. 
</P>
<P>
These three reasons, then, are fundamentally pretexts, offered to bolster the 
political and legal case of the United States for undertaking an action 
motivated by one goal -- to remove Noriega from power. Undeniably, the general 
is an unsavory character. His regime in Panama was guilty of substantial 
human-rights violations; he cynically disrupted last May's electoral process 
when it appeared his chosen candidate might lose. 
</P>
<P>
There is also little question that he has been involved in thoroughly 
reprehensible activities, probably including drug trafficking. In a checkered 
career marked, above all, by rank opportunism, Noriega almost certainly added 
the narcotics network to his long line of funders, which also included, at 
various times, the CIA and the Cuban government. Understandably, Noriega has 
few admirers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
But the question remains: Does any nation have the right to decide unilaterally 
-- without invitation from a lawful and internationally recognized government 
and without approval in advance by any constituted international organization 
-- to send in its forces to remove a foreign leader, however loathsome? 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration can label its military action in Panama "Operation Just 
Cause." But we must ask ourselves whether any cause, however just, is 
sufficient to warrant the use of massive military force, unless it is in 
response to a direct and immediate threat to the nation's vital security 
interests, or to protect the lives and safety of its citizens who cannot 
otherwise be shielded. A century ago, nations used military force for a wide 
variety of purposes -- to collect debts, secure tribute, punish those who 
mistreated its citizens. But the world has evolved a great deal since the era 
when the Panama Canal itself was constructed, and nations today have 
established international norms that severely curtail the use of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Where do we stand? What rules of international conduct do we espouse? Do we 
think there is one set of rules for other nations and another for the United 
States -- or one set of rules for other regions and another that applies to the 
Western Hemisphere? These are the questions Latin Americans are asking and that 
history will pose. They are the issues we ourselves must confront.

NUCLEAR WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing a letter in response to your editorial "Garbage That's Too Hot to 
Handle" (Dec. 2): I am disappointed in the editorial; it did not take a strong 
stance in its position on nuclear waste. Of course the disposal of nuclear 
waste is linked to man's future and posterity. That garbage remains dangerous 
for close to 10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Energy needs to find new ways to either harness energy or 
eliminate the dangerous waste once and for all. Presently, there may be areas 
able to keep the waste. However, at the rate we are producing it, there won't 
be enough places to deposit the waste for long. What will we do then? Will we 
start poisoning outer space just as we will by then have our own planet? 
</P>
<P>
There may be arguments suggesting that the disposal areas are checked so that 
there will be no leaks into our environment. This sounds reassuring, yet how 
sure are the experts? Many officials in charge may be negligent or too 
preoccupied with other problems. By placing the radioactive waste in our ground 
-- no matter how secure the site is -- we face the risk of contaminating our 
water and killing plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Is it our right to gamble with the lives of other creatures on this Earth as 
well as our own?

And because of the generosity of one company, 230 Santa Ana schoolchildren with 
fine attendance records have received a tree as a gift this year. The 6- to 
7-foot firs were given to the children by the school district and J.M. Peters 
Co., a Newport Beach developer. Children from needy families were singled out. 
Had they not been rewarded with the gift, the children might not have had a 
tree this year. 
</P>
<P>
Their trees will not be exactly like the 17-foot specimen in the lobby of 
Orange County Edition of The Times in Costa Mesa. That tree is perfectly 
shaped, right up to its top branches. It is a dark, healthy-looking green. 
</P>
<P>
Upon closer inspection, however, one can see that Mother Nature was given a 
little help: where the tall fir was a little sparse, branches had been nailed 
to its trunk to fill in, held up with wires. The tree came with instructions: 
"Paint green and flock ends." We are surprised they didn't add: "Spray with 
pine scent daily." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow all this takes some of the mystique away. It's a little like plastic 
surgery: more fun if no one knows about it. And it's something like gazing at a 
beautiful sunset and saying, "Now, if it just had a little more red right 
there. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
No matter the perfection of a tree, it brings a certain happy feeling to the 
holiday season. We're glad that the Santa Ana schoolchildren will get to share 
that, too.

UC IRVINE FALLS IN OVERTIME TO LOYOLA OF CHICAGO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan started his sixth different lineup Thursday night 
against Loyola of Chicago, and it started out no better than the previous five. 
</P>
<P>
If anything it was worse, at least in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters, with two freshmen and a gimpy point guard starting, went 
scoreless for the first three minutes before Jeff Von Lutzow, one of the 
freshman, made a layup. 
</P>
<P>
They trailed by 16 at one point in the first half, rallied to force overtime in 
the second, then lost, 78-72, before 1,437 fans in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive defeat for Irvine (2-7). 
</P>
<P>
Keir Rogers had 35 points and Keith Gailes 28 to lead Loyola (3-3). Every time 
Irvine came close, Rogers or Gailes made a key field goal or free throw. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine tied the score, 66-66, but missed two chances to win in the final 
seconds of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Palmer's eight-foot shot in the lane was short. Justin Anderson rebounded, 
but his off-balance shot bounced off the rim as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
In overtime, Loyola scored first on free throw by Rogers and never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers' three-point play put the game out of reach, 72-67. 
</P>
<P>
Gailes made four free throws in the final minute to seal the victory. ELLIOTT

DRIESELL IS ALIVE, WELL AND COACHING AT JAMES MADISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He is 57 years old, mostly bald, sometimes cranky, but Lefty Driesell is alive 
and well and wants you to know he is not somewhere out in the sticks. 
</P>
<P>
The former coach at Davidson and Maryland, where he left under a cloud after 
the death of Len Bias and criticism over the graduation rate of his players, 
Driesell says James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., is a mighty fine 
place to be. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have to make any adjustments," Driesell said. "I love it here. I like 
it here much better than I did in Maryland. It's up in the mountains -- the 
scenery, the people are real nice. I just like this area. . . . Now don't make 
it sound so people will think I didn't like Maryland." 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes of JMU wear purple and gold and play for Lefty, whose red, white, 
black and gold Maryland Terrapins are still down in College Park the second 
coach since Lefty left. The first was Bob Wade, forced to resign in the wake of 
an NCAA investigation. Now, Gary Williams is sitting in Cole Field House on the 
bench where Lefty sat in the building that Lefty ruled with the team that Lefty 
might have coached. 
</P>
<P>
But Driesell said there's no looking back. Adjustment? What adjustment? 
</P>
<P>
"It's no different for me," he said. "I'm just trying to win ballgames and 
recruit." 
</P>
<P>
Driesell, a Virginian, said he looks no farther than James Madison University, 
named after the fourth President of the United States, also a Virginian 
inaugurated when he was the same age as Lefty is now. There will be no "next" 
job, in all probability, Driesell said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect to move, but you never say never," he said. "I wouldn't ever 
apply for another job. If somebody came and offered me a whole bunch of money, 
I'd have to think about it, but I'm not really interested in money. At my age, 
somebody is not going to buy me if I didn't want to go." 
</P>
<P>
And so, right in Ralph Sampson's hometown, Lefty Driesell talks about what a 
fine academic school James Madison is, how close it is to Washington (nearly a 
two-hour drive), how many kids want to come there to school and how much media 
attention he gets. 
</P>
<P>
"Plenty," Driesell said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of places I go, people say, 'JMU, what does that stand for?' and I say, 
'Well, you'll find out,' " Driesell said. "I just think you got to get up in 
the top 10 and people know who you are. People didn't know who Davidson was 
before I got there. If we get good clubs here, they'll know. It's just a matter 
of winning." 
</P>
<P>
James Madison is 5-3 this season. 
</P>
<P>
Add Lefty: Driesell said he would like to play USC but that George Raveling 
turned him down. Raveling, an assistant for Driesell at Maryland for four 
years, said Driesell was right. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends, I won't play," Raveling said. "I won't play him and I won't play 
John Thompson. I don't like to schedule any friends because one of us has to 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
Raveling was an assistant coach on Thompson's staff for the 1988 Seoul Olympic 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
Milestone: When UCLA played Notre Dame at South Bend, Ind., last Sunday, it was 
the 300th game of Jim Harrick's college coaching career. After the Bruins' 
89-74 victory over American, Tuesday night, Harrick is 193-108. 
</P>
<P>
Five is enough: This season, the Big East, Southeastern and Trans America 
Conferences are experimenting with a six-foul rule in conference games, but 
former UCLA coach John Wooden is not a big fan of the rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought it was important to learn to play defense without fouling," 
Wooden said. 
</P>
<P>
One isn't enough: At Georgetown, 7-foot-2 Dikembe Mutombo of Zaire is a vital 
cog as a shot-swatting whiz. Soon, he may not be the only Mutombo on the block. 
Tshitenge Mutombo, 6-8, is attending a boarding school in Pennsylvania and is 
interested in playing beside his brother. 
</P>
<P>
The holdup, according to the Sporting News, is that the standardized tests 
mandated by Proposition 48 are not in French, Tshitenge's native language. 
</P>
<P>
Locker room confidential: Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda gave winless Valparaiso a 
pregame pep talk before the Musketeers' home game against Xavier last Saturday. 
Valparaiso lost by 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
Upset: Sonoma State defeated Fresno State. The University of Illinois at 
Chicago defeated Michigan State. Western Illinois defeated DePaul. Coppin State 
defeated Maryland. Northern Illinois defeated DePaul. 
</P>
<P>
So far, upsets have become rather commonplace, even whopping ones. Favored 
teams are beaten all the time, but what seems to be different this year is that 
many of the so-called creampuff teams have been beating the big guys. 
</P>
<P>
Toledo defeated Houston. Wyoming was defeated by Sam Houston State. Tulsa 
defeated Oklahoma State. U.S. International defeated Drake. 
</P>
<P>
Is this parity? 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a better question," Raveling said. "Are coaches starting to take a 
second look at the so-called cupcake games? What the point is, it's getting 
more and more shaky. If you lose, how do you explain it to your alumni?" 
</P>
<P>
Raveling scheduled tiny Prairie View A&amp;M of Prairie View, Tex., this 
season. Last week, it was announced that Prairie View won't offer athletic 
scholarships next year and probably will drop out of the Southwestern Athletic 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Prairie View's days of producing upsets have past, teams such as Coppin 
State and Sonoma State continue the tradition. Wooden said what's happening 
this year is nothing out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
"We forget what's happened in the past," Wooden said. "We are probably seeing 
what we've had in years before. There were always a fair amount of upsets, but 
we've forgotten them. 
</P>
<P>
"The great pitchers sometimes can't get anyone out," he said. "The great 
hitters sometimes go hitless. We must accept the fact that things performed by 
human beings aren't always perfect."

<TEXT>
<P>
Anthony Tucker made two free-throws with 29 seconds to play Thursday night to 
clinch Wake Forest's 67-65 victory over No. 20 Alabama at Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight was probably the low point in my coaching career," Alabama Coach Wimp 
Sanderson said. "We played with no intensity, and did nothing inside. There was 
no hustle on our part tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Tucker scored 20 points as the Demon Deacons (6-1) held off a late charge by 
the Crimson Tide (7-2). 
</P>
<P>
No. 12 Duke 89, Davidson 44 -- The Blue Devils, playing their first game after 
a 12-day break for exams, used a swarming defense to smother the Wildcats at 
Davidson, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Duke (4-2) forced 28 turnovers that led to numerous easy baskets. The Blue 
Devils limited Davidson (1-5) to 30% shooting. The Wildcats made only 18 of 61 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 N.C. State 110, North Carolina Asheville 70 -- Rodney Monroe made nine 
three-point shots and scored 31 points to help the Wolfpack rout the Bulldogs 
at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Accurate outside shooting helped the Wolfpack (7-2) take a 49-33 halftime lead. 
They made 10 of 17 shots from three-point range in the first half, including 
four of eight by Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
No. 23 La Salle 71, Villanova 70 -- Doug Overton scored 19 points and freshman 
guard Randy Woods scored five points in the last 53 seconds as the Explorers 
defeated the Wildcats at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Woods made a three-point shot with 53 seconds remaining to give La Salle (5-0) 
a 69-66 lead. Villanova (6-4) cut it to 69-68 on a layup by Tom Greis, but two 
free throws by Woods with 21 seconds left provided the winning points. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State 67, Southwest Texas 53 -- Shawn Jamison scored 19 points and 
grabbed nine rebounds as the Aztecs (6-3) defeated the Bobcats in a first round 
game of the University of Alabama Birmingham Tournament.

<TEXT>
<P>
Doc Rivers stole the ball from Grant Long and hit two free throws with 
seven-tenths of a second left as the Atlanta Hawks defeated the Miami Heat, 
117-115, Thursday night at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
After Dominique Wilkins' free throw put Atlanta ahead, 115-113, with eight 
seconds left, Long took an inbounds pass and drove to the basket. Rivers 
slapped the ball away and dribbled into the front court, where he was fouled by 
Sherman Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
"Long broke through and I thought he might get a three-point play," Rivers 
said. "He was going full steam one way. I was going full steam the other, and I 
got it." 
</P>
<P>
Rivers hit both free throws, giving the Hawks enough to survive Glenn Rice's 
basket at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Moses Malone led the Hawks with 28 points. Rivers had 24 and Wilkins 22. 
</P>
<P>
Rice had a season-high 27 points. Rony Seikaly added 22. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 123, Portland 102 -- Derrick McKey scored 22 points as the SuperSonics 
won at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Ellis got 11 of his 23 points as the Sonics outscored Portland, 35-21, and 
opened a 93-72 lead in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier McDaniel scored 22, and Sedale Threatt added 18 points. Clyde Drexler 
led Portland with 25 points.

'BALLERINA CLOWN' -- THE COURT JESTER OF VENICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like lightning that suddenly explodes from the quiet gathering of invisible, 
charged particles in the atmosphere, Jonathan Borofsky's best work manages to 
pull you up short by igniting a sudden crack! of recognition. A spectator, 
wide-eyed and delirious, is left momentarily reeling. 
</P>
<P>
Borofsky's great "Ballerina Clown," a monumental sculpture unveiled last week 
at the conspicuous corner of Main Street and Rose Avenue in Venice, is just 
such an extraordinary concatenation of forms. Thirty feet tall, mechanized, 
vividly painted and perched on a soap box high atop an architectural pedestal, 
the gently kicking dancer wears oversize gloves and the bulb-nosed mask of a 
sentimental circus clown. 
</P>
<P>
A figure rather like an eccentric, streetside orator magically elevated to 
civic symbol, "Ballerina Clown" stands as a poignant, sharply observed visual 
essay on everybody's worst nightmare: the gentle soul magnanimously determined 
to add at least a slender grace note to the world, yet pitilessly being taken 
for a laughingstock. 
</P>
<P>
A certain irony marks this ego-wrenching subject. For there are those who, 
caught unawares by Borofsky's startling sculpture, harbor a sneaking suspicion 
that it might be they who are being made the fool. Stand at Rose and Main for 
any length of time and you're bound to see and hear the full range of possible 
opinion about the piece, from shrieks of stunned delight to grumpy grimaces. 
</P>
<P>
It's understandable. Yes, the sculpture could claim a heady modern ancestry, 
from Watteau's Pierrot and Degas' dancers to the circus performers of Picasso 
and Seurat. In my experience, however, nothing, anywhere, is quite like 
Borofsky's dancing giant. 
</P>
<P>
"Ballerina Clown" does connect in the memory with objects familiar from the 
daily landscape, most notably the cartoon colossuses peddling hamburgers, 
automobile tires, exterminators and such all along roadside America. Astutely 
sizing up the sculpture's highly public site, the artist has chosen to speak 
with a common vocabulary of public forms. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because we're used to dismissing those commercial signs as junky 
ephemera, at best, or as intrusive eyesores, at worst, there is an initial 
dazed resistance to seeing a related motif inhabiting the vaunted precinct of 
public art. That is where we have come to expect something decorative and 
pretentious, not to mention airlessly innocuous. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I think there is another reason Borofsky's sculpture might draw some 
fire amid enchantment. Like anything foreign or strange, "Ballerina Clown" is a 
convenient magnet for whatever unfocused feelings of ill-will might linger 
toward Venice Renaissance, the huge real estate development to which it is 
attached, and for which it was commissioned. Succinctly described in publicity 
materials as "an upscale, mixed-use project" featuring 1.6 acres of "retail 
shops, restaurants and deluxe upscale condominiums with ocean views," Venice 
Renaissance was built by Harlan Lee &amp; Associates and the Anden Group, and 
designed by architect Johannes Van Tilburg. 
</P>
<P>
As a project, it's a typically banal, pastel behemoth by the beach. Corinthian 
columns not withstanding, the "rebirth" lifelessly proposed by the block-long 
Venice Renaissance is one in which a faded neighborhood gets relentlessly 
gentrified -- surprise! -- thus retelling a single-minded tale of real estate 
that is just about synonymous with the modern story of Los Angeles, of 
California, of the United States. The sculpture is the single best thing about 
the place. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Borofsky frequently adapts past motifs in his work to new situations, 
wholly remaking them in the process, and that is what he has done here. 
"Ballerina Clown" began life in 1982-83 as a gallery-scale sculpture that 
woozily sings a recorded rendition of the self-absorbed Frank Sinatra hit, "My 
Way." The oddly affecting piece is among the artist's best. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, the tutu-and-toe-shoe-clad dancer turned up as a nearly lifesize 
graphic figure, her left hand holding a kite-string from which a plastic ring 
bobbed, in a series of hand-colored lithographs. They may be the world's first 
animated prints. 
</P>
<P>
The Venice figure, in keeping with its monumental new scale and the demands of 
its bulky site, has been made less spindly than in these earlier incarnations. 
Gone are the ballerina's lace tights, the kite string and plastic ring. It is 
wired for sound, but reportedly won't sing except on unnamed special occasions. 
(I can't wait!) Balancing en pointe and perpetually kicking her mechanical 
right leg, she holds together left thumb and forefinger in a gesture somewhere 
between a Buddhist pose of meditation and the all-American signal for "OK." 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, Borofsky's sculpture draws life from, and gives it back to, its 
inimical context. Given the public and commercial setting, a peculiar spin 
attends its deft allusion to roadside signage. Real estate development is 
typically hawked with beneficent, lofty claims, which invariably seem to result 
in a built environment that's proud to wear a grotesque public face. And that 
is a pretty good description of a poised ballerina wearing the clownish mask of 
the fool. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the rosy rhetoric of civic uplift also fuels the claims commonly 
made for public art, claims that have left the landscape littered with dross. 
It's rare indeed for public art to critically address its own situation, but 
that's what "Ballerina Clown" triumphantly does. Venerable is the legacy of the 
tragi-comic court jester, whose license it is to publicly ridicule the very 
institutions that support him. 
</P>
<P>
At Venice Renaissance a second commissioned sculpture is more typical of the 
bland mediocrity commonly churned out to match the fulsome rhetoric. Guy Dill's 
"The Harmic Arch" is a 75-foot span of welded, skeletal, geometric shapes that 
vaults over the Navy Street entrance to the parking garage. ("Harmic" is 
reportedly a Sumatran word meaning "coming from a humble/heroic element.") 
Garage entrances tend to be ugly, if plainly necessary, and this one is no 
exception. Appended to the architectural forms of the building, the Tinkertoy 
shapes of the sculpture create luxury camouflage for the unsightly driveway -- 
chiefly for the benefit of residents in the half-dozen "deluxe upscale 
condominiums," whose ocean-view balconies loom out over the concrete abyss. 
</P>
<P>
By rather stark contrast, Borofsky's streetside sculpture admits of both deeply 
human desire and equally human failing. A communal gesture of remarkable 
generosity and goodwill, it's a momentous work of public art.

Top 200 Art Collectors: Real estate developers lead the list of the world's top 
200 art collectors, which includes a retired New York postman. The list, which 
will appear in the January issue of ARTnews magazine, includes 114 Americans, 
12 Japanese and 12 Englishmen. New York and California have more collectors 
than any country, with the exception of the United States. Almost all the 
collectors buy art with money they made themselves, reported compiler Richard 
Walker, a contributing editor of ARTnews. Only 22 collectors on Walker's list 
rely on inherited funds or money acquired through divorce. One of the 
least-known of the self-made collectors is former New York City postman and 
investor Herbert Vogel who, with his wife, Dorothy, has assembled a leading 
collection of contemporary art, currently on a tour of museums across the 
nation. Another is Joel Wachs, the Los Angeles city councilman, who parlayed a 
$10,000 investment into an outstanding collection of post-World War II art.

Toronto Symphony to Tour Pacific Rim: Calling it the most ambitious 
international tour in its 67-year history, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra has 
announced a spring tour of the Pacific Rim. Covering 26 days and 11 cities, the 
tour will also include the first visit to Australia by a major Canadian 
orchestra. The tour begins in Vancouver on April 30 with a performance at the 
Orpheum Theatre, then travels to San Francisco for a concert at the Louise M. 
Davies Symphony Hall. After that, there will be concerts at four cities in 
Australia, three in Japan and single concerts in Singapore and Taiwan. CLAUDIA

TORA-SAN SAVES THE DAY, THIS TIME IN VIENNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"Tora-san Goes to Vienna" (at the Little Tokyo Cinemas) but he doesn't arrive 
until 45 minutes into this nearly two-hour film, the 41st in the world's 
longest-running film series. Longtime fans of Tora-san (Kiyoshi Atsumi), that 
lovable, comical itinerant peddler, wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
First, Tora's creator, Yoji Yamada, has to catch up with him in some charming 
out-of-the-way locale and then bring him home to his relatives' sweet shop in 
the equally charming Shibamata, that northernmost neighborhood of Tokyo. That 
Yamada is leisurely about it is the point: in a rushed, busy world only Tora, 
as feckless as he is and ever luckless in love, seems to have the time to 
bother with people and their problems. 
</P>
<P>
As always, Tora crosses paths with someone in crisis. This time it's an 
exceedingly stressed-out young executive (skinny, rubber-faced comedian Akiro 
Emoto), whom Tora pulls together at a spa. So grateful is the man that he 
insists Tora accompany him on a vacation in Vienna, which Tora thinks is some 
place in Kyushu. Once in the Austrian capital, the executive continues the 
regimen of wine, women and song -- very discreetly suggested, for this is a 
family film -- which Tora introduced him to at the spa. Meanwhile, Tora as 
usual encounters a pretty young woman (Keiko Takeshita) in distress. She is a 
hard-working tourist guide, in love with a young Austrian (Martin Loschberger) 
but desperately homesick. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Austrian locales add freshness to the Tora formula, but Yamada 
amusingly makes the point that Tora might as well have stayed home and in his 
heart never really left Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The cultural riches and grand architecture of Vienna are entirely lost on this 
wholly unsophisticated man: all that concerns him is the dilemma of Takeshita, 
with whom he typically becomes more smitten than he realizes. And although 
Yamada follows Emoto briefly on a standard sightseeing tour of Vienna, it's the 
Austrian countryside to which the director responds to the extent that we 
understand why Tora sometimes forgets he is not in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"Tora-san Goes to Vienna," which has a delightful appearance by the elegant 
Keiko Awaji as Takeshita's friend (and, as an inside joke, Harry Lime's widow), 
is as sentimental and endearing as its predecessors. The Tora-sans can always 
be counted on as a year-end holiday treat.

HOLOCAUST REVENGE TAKES ROOT IN 'ROSE GARDEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fons Rademakers' "The Rose Garden" (at the Westside Pavilion) certainly 
accomplishes what it sets out to do: Call attention to an especially hideous 
Nazi atrocity and show how difficult it is to bring the responsible Nazi 
commandant to justice. Rademakers, the veteran Dutch director whose similarly 
themed "The Assault" won an Oscar, suggests quite forcefully how a segment of 
the German population continues to resist coming to terms with the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rose Garden" is further bolstered by an impassioned performance by Liv 
Ullmann as a tenacious Frankfurt public defender and by Maximilian Schell's 
fine portrayal of a haunted, ravaged Holocaust survivor. However, Rademakers, 
working in English -- not even the smallest bit player sounds dubbed -- is 
hampered by a script that does not serve him nearly as well as that of "The 
Assault." 
</P>
<P>
What is factual about the film is that on April 20, 1945, Hitler's 56th 
birthday, 20 Jewish children, most of whom had been deliberately infected with 
tubercular bacilli in their lungs at the Neuengamme concentration camp, were 
taken to the basement of a Hamburg school and given morphine injections and 
then hanged. The executions were ordered because British troops were only six 
kilometers from the port city. 
</P>
<P>
Around this horrendous incident, screenwriter Paul Hengge has imagined this 
plot: Schell, brother of two sisters who apparently died at the school, has 
come from his home in Ecuador to West Germany determined to prevent the 
one-time commander of Neuengamme (Kurt Hubner) from leaving the country, just 
as yet another investigation of his responsibility in the atrocity is about to 
be launched. 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, the language barrier creates confusion and uncertainties in 
the narrative. Obviously, if we have to have an English-language version of a 
German film, it's better that it not be the usual dubbed kind. Even so, we're 
never quite sure where we are -- even on a second viewing -- as the film 
switches endlessly from Hamburg to West Berlin to Frankfurt. Other key matters 
pose unanswered questions: Why, once Ullmann realizes that Schell is a camp 
survivor, doesn't it occur to her immediately that the man he strikes out at 
violently is most likely an old Nazi? Since Schell's victim is an old Nazi, why 
does he want to press charges against Schell? Is it out of arrogance because he 
has successfully evaded justice in the past? Probably, but we never know for 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
Schell, 59, plays a man his age but has made himself look a haggard 10 or even 
20 years older, a man so traumatized he can barely speak in his own defense. He 
is the film's linchpin, since Ullmann has been handed so many anti-Nazi 
speeches that not even she can keep them from becoming wearying in their 
repetitiveness. Peter Fonda, whose suggestion of a German accent allows him to 
blend in with the cast, is effective as Ullmann's suave, ambitious ex-husband 
(and ex-law partner) whose gradual response from indifference to concern is 
persuasive. Gila Almagor, the grande dame of the Israeli cinema, makes a brief 
but stunning appearance. 
</P>
<P>
What "The Rose Garden" (rated PG-13 for violence and adult themes) has to say 
is too important not to regret that it wasn't said better.

TWO HAROLD PINTER ONE-ACT PLAYS AT THE WATERFRONT STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like most people who live long enough, great playwrights carry baggage around 
with them -- some of which they're not responsible for. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Pinter's particular baggage, more a problem in the States than in his 
native England, is a reputation for heaviness and his refusal to pin matters 
down. As baggage goes, Pinter's is downright un-American. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. actors and directors confess that they won't touch him. What to do 
with all those pauses and absurdities and silences? How silent? And for how 
long? 
</P>
<P>
Pinter himself showed how misguided much of this was when he staged his "Old 
Times" at the Henry Fonda four years ago. Listeners could hear that there were 
words in those silences, and they were often funny. 
</P>
<P>
That was a non-American production, though. And some of his work, like his 
spare one-acts, "Silence" and "Landscape," is seldom funny. The word that a 
local group, the Aresis Ensemble, was staging this pair at their Waterfront 
Stage didn't exactly quicken the heart. 
</P>
<P>
So it's nice to report that some domestic actors can pick up Pinter, throw away 
the nonsense baggage, and carry him somewhere. For a small theater, the 
Waterfront has a big stage, but directors Charles Duncombe Jr.'s ("Silence") 
and Kevin McMahon's ("Landscape") actors fill it with well-spoken words, as 
well as unspoken ones. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's duo of Strawn Bovee and Richard Courtney as "Landscape's" estranged 
spouses and ex-servants interplay almost perfectly with each other. She is lost 
in the memory of a past love, which doesn't include her husband. While she sits 
in a slender rocking chair, he attempts eye contact with her over an enormously 
thick work table. 
</P>
<P>
The husband is all work, with little time out for feelings, which makes the 
wife's attempt at memory -- the great quest in all of Pinter's work -- all the 
more understandable and desperate. 
</P>
<P>
Bovee wears the mantle of weariness, but not so much that she can't rise to 
grasp a thought that might refresh her soul. Courtney, looking like a burly 
seaman, couldn't be more at visual and verbal odds; yet the contrast isn't a 
black-and-white cartoon, but a theatricalization of how far couples can drift 
from each other. 
</P>
<P>
Duncombe's "Silence" is nearly as good, but Sherry Landau's Ellen feels the 
Pinter baggage too much. She plays a woman in the middle, bounded on each side 
by her two past lovers (the older Harvey Solin, the younger Lawrence Levy, all 
caught in Kevin Graves' beautiful, harsh pools of light). If the strategy is to 
suggest Ellen being in an emotional straitjacket now that she is without a 
sexual Other, Duncombe and Landau push the idea too far. 
</P>
<P>
The men, though, are powerfully real. Solin makes us think of all sorts of dark 
and wonderful things for his character: this moment, he's a father substitute, 
and loving it; next moment, he's painfully lonely, and she's his last chance. 
Levy looks like a thoughtful guy on the prowl, and lets the contradictions that 
description suggests come through the words. All the clues to Pinter are in the 
words, and the Aresis people have done some good detective work. 
</P>
<P>
 At 250 Santa Monica Pier, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Re-opens Jan. 9, 
through Jan. 17. Tickets: $10; (213) 393-6672.

JAZZ REVIEW;

SUPERLATIVE LEE KONITZ AT NOISY ST. MARK'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Konitz is holding a virtual master class in improvisation at St. Mark's in 
Venice this week. His opening performance Wednesday night included some solos 
that both defined and extended the substance of contemporary jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective auditors, however, may have difficulty keeping track of the alto 
saxophonist's remarkable playing. St. Mark's is a lovely room, with an 
open-minded management and a superlative kitchen. But it also is the noisiest 
space this side of a construction site. 
</P>
<P>
Konitz seemed astonished by the wave of sound coming back at him from the 
audience and, particularly, from two or three overly celebratory party tables. 
He tried whistling and shouting at them; he tried playing honks, squeals and 
tremolos; finally, in bemused frustration, he tried conducting the noise. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing much helped until the other musicians -- Charlie Haden on bass, Harold 
Danko on piano and Tom Brechtlein on drums -- joined Konitz in ignoring the 
crowd and turning inward toward the music. The result, especially on a 
surprisingly thoughtful performance of "Body and Soul," was a series of 
exquisite improvisatory gems. 
</P>
<P>
Konitz's soaring lines, curling in and around the harmony, represented the best 
counter one could offer to the bluster and clatter of the room. Even more, his 
playing -- richer and more passionate now than ever before -- clearly testified 
to his status as one of the few uniquely original voices on his chosen 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Haden, Danko and Brechtlein matched Konitz's performance on all counts. Danko's 
solo work echoed the Konitz's linear flow and Haden -- in those rare moments 
when he could be heard -- was characteristically sturdy. 
</P>
<P>
The group continues at St. Mark's through Saturday. DON HECKMAN

LONG BEACH'S PASTA AL DENTE PUTS A LITTLE PIZAZZ INTO PIZZAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a little trattoria in Naples -- the Naples in Long Beach, that is -- 
called Pasta al Dente that makes remarkably quaint desserts. As you enter the 
door, you might find a chocolate-kiwi pizza staring you in the face, like a 
motif of what's to come. 
</P>
<P>
Pasta al Dente looks sort of like a Westside place: two big white rooms with 
lots of mirrors and a turquoise accent here and there, and the sound track runs 
to Mozart, Smetana and Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
Chef Kimberlie Carroll has actually worked on the Westside, e.g. at La Toque, 
and what she has done to the menu at this neighborhood pizza/pasta joint can be 
quite interesting. For instance, although not all the pizzas are remarkable, 
the Al Dente Pizza definitely is. Perched on a medium-thin crust, its topping 
of feta cheese, black olives and both dried and fresh tomatoes has a light 
texture and an enjoyably sharp flavor. 
</P>
<P>
There are some unusual pastas among the largely familiar lineup. A couple have 
curried sauces, and angel hair bocca caldo, the name supposedly meaning "hot 
mouth," is mixed with garlic, pickled medium-hot Italian peppers, sun-dried 
tomatoes and slightly peppery oil, not a huge portion but about right for a 
cold evening. Pasta Dijon is green fettuccine with chicken and a pleasantly 
novel Dijon mustard sauce. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, while the lasagna is quite sensible, filled with ricotta and 
served in a slightly peppery tomato sauce, the lasagne di mare merely adds 
shrimp, crab and scallops. Somehow it seems better plain. And Pasta al Dente's 
risotto is really a paella, the rice cooked dry with tomato sauce as in Spanish 
rice and mixed with shrimp, chicken and peas. 
</P>
<P>
There is a short list of non-pizza, non-pasta entrees, mostly involving 
chicken. The one the menu urges you to try is pollo voila, which is even more 
cross-cultural in effect than the Franco-Italian name suggests. The cream sauce 
has a Southeast Asian effect, tasting faintly of coconut as well as tarragon. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the appetizers is scallops sauteed in garlicky cream sauce. The 
only soup of the day I've tried was sweet potato, and it was extremely odd: a 
thin, slightly sweet, very fine-grained puree of sweet potato, pale ocher in 
color and scented with cinnamon and clove. It could be a sauce for a dessert, 
but it's very strange way to begin a meal. The only thorough failure I've had 
here, though, was some damp and doughy focaccia bread. 
</P>
<P>
Now to the remarkably quaint desserts. The filling of the lemon cheesecake is 
dyed a virulent yellow and has a sweet frosting, just like a layer cake. The 
thick and not excessively sweet raspberry puree it floats on, though, is 
tasteful by any standard, unusually full of raspberry flavor. There are 
decorative squiggles drawn on the sauce in creme anglaise, Westside fashion. 
</P>
<P>
This does not prepare you for what goes on with some of the other desserts. A 
luscious cheesecake full of chocolate bits comes with sauce and squiggles, but 
not tasteful raspberry sauce with gracefully wavy lines of creme anglaise; no, 
it's a checkerboard pattern of chocolate sauce and cherry-flavored creme 
anglaise with mysterious puffs of green stuff -- mint, I think -- here and 
there, like a chocoholic's drawing of a Christmas tree. The same sort of 
colorful gridwork shows up on a pair of heart-shaped chocolate brownies known 
as Chocolate Decadence. 
</P>
<P>
But as for the chocolate pizza, I really can't say. It just sits at the door, 
all alone, remote from any serving spatula. Maybe it is just a motif. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasta al Dente, 5856 Naples Plaza, Long Beach; (213) 433-1616. Open for dinner 
daily, brunch Sunday. Beer and wine. Street parking. MasterCard and Visa 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $30-$54.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Merry Christmas to. . . . 
</P>
<P>
LARRY KING: For his CNN talk show, the best on TV. And for nailing the old 
Morton Downey Jr. series, later canceled, as "talk wrestling." 
</P>
<P>
JAY LENO: Subbing for Johnny Carson, he's late-night's top new host by far. 
Yes, better than Arsenio Hall. Leno also disclosed after the Alaskan oil spill 
that TV news "showed baby seals clubbing Exxon officials." 
</P>
<P>
RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN AND LINDSAY WAGNER: For raw courage -- he for risking the 
airwaves in "Island Son," she for doing the same in "Peaceable Kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
JACKIE MASON: If "Chicken Soup" had started with his playing a TV talk-show 
host, instead of toying with the idea after it was too late, it might have been 
a long-run hit. 
</P>
<P>
PETER FALK: For showing he could go home again in "Columbo." It's so nice to 
have him back where he belongs. 
</P>
<P>
TED TURNER: For explaining his philosophy for colorizing films: "I think the 
movies look better in color, pal. And they're my movies." 
</P>
<P>
CITIZEN WELLES: The late Orson Welles had such an ironclad contract protecting 
"Citizen Kane" that Turner surrendered this year and gave up attempts to 
colorize it for TV. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS CHANNEL 2: For the most absurd press release of the year: "KCBS-TV is 
pleased to announce that Action News anchors Bree Walker and Jim Lampley will 
be married in April, 1990. No interviews will be granted." 
</P>
<P>
SIR JOHN GIELGUD: For the best network TV performance in memory, as Jewish 
scholar Aaron Jastrow in "War and Remembrance." 
</P>
<P>
NBC NEWS: For the brilliant move forcing Jane Pauley out of "Today" at the peak 
of her career and popularity, and bringing in Deborah Norville, who'll probably 
take several years to settle into the job. And people get paid for those 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
JANE PAULEY: She came out smelling like a rose, bargained for a firm 52-week 
commitment for a new NBC prime-time series and co-hosts the special "The 
Eighties" with Tom Brokaw Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
"TWILIGHT ZONE" FANS: A reminder -- Rod Serling would have been 65 on Christmas 
Day. He died in 1975 at age 50. 
</P>
<P>
SAM DONALDSON AND DIANE SAWYER: It's not working, so why not pack it in with 
"PrimeTime Live" and start the new year fresh, with something worthwhile? 
</P>
<P>
ROSEANNE BARR: She's sitting on top of the world, so is it necessary to throw 
her weight around behind the scenes on "Roseanne"? It started with creator Matt 
Williams being forced out of the show. 
</P>
<P>
C-SPAN: Happy 10th anniversary. The best way to get an instant fix on public 
opinion of major issues is to tune in C-SPAN's phone-in shows. They're like 
national letters-to-the-editor columns. 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT DUVALL: Hope it's not true that he's sworn off TV because he didn't win 
an Emmy for his extraordinary performance in "Lonesome Dove." 
</P>
<P>
JOHNNY CARSON: For informing us that Michigan turned down the license-plate 
slogan "Keeping Japan on Top Since 1973." 
</P>
<P>
CHARLIE ROSE: TV's best-kept secret with his really fine "Nightwatch" talk show 
for insomniacs -- on CBS from 2 to 6 a.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. LAW": For finally planning to re-shoot its opening title sequence to 
reflect the changing L.A. skyline. The Wells Fargo logo no longer is atop the 
building that supposedly houses the law firm of McKenzie, Brackman et al. In 
fact, Wells Fargo has moved from that building. And how could any new skyline 
shot not include the First Interstate building, the tallest west of the 
Mississippi? Case closed. 
</P>
<P>
SCOTT ST. JAMES: KCAL Channel 9 could no longer find room on its staff for St. 
James, one of L.A.'s best sportscasters, and that makes you wonder about the 
judgment behind its twice-delayed, nightly three-hour news program that begins 
in March -- maybe. 
</P>
<P>
HUELL HOWSER: For the best programs on KCET Channel 28 -- his series of 
human-interest "Videolog" shorts that reflect life in Southern California. 
Remember the one on the 102-year-old man who ate nothing but his own homemade 
yogurt? Well, Huell asked viewers to send cards and letters to the old-timer 
for his 105th birthday -- and 1,200 greetings poured in through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
CONNIE CHUNG: Things seemed good at NBC -- high-rated prime-time specials, one 
after another. Then she defected to CBS for more money and her own series, 
"Saturday Night With Connie Chung." No more high ratings. Money doesn't buy 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
"TOUR OF DUTY": While "China Beach" gets lots of press, and deservedly so, 
"Tour of Duty" renders a much more accurate image of the heavy presence of 
blacks among U.S. troops in Vietnam. And that's an important accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
JOHN WILCOCK: A founder of the Village Voice, this bon vivant and travel expert 
now has a public access show full of TV experimentation and witty notes. For 
instance: "Sex relieves tension, and love causes it." 
</P>
<P>
KAREEM ABDUL JABBAR: Some genius at NBC decided to give him a deserving hour 
tribute on his retirement -- and then scheduled it opposite a Lakers game in 
which he was playing. Guess which got the most viewers? 
</P>
<P>
CHRIS BURKE: This young actor with Down's syndrome gave prime time its most 
inspirational moments in the new season in the notable family drama series 
"Life Goes On." 
</P>
<P>
GEORGE BUSH: Lesley Stahl and some other electronic reporters weren't thrilled 
when the President made clear he didn't cater to TV the way Ronald Reagan did. 
Well, tough for TV. And good for Bush. He is, by the way, more truly natural on 
the tube than either J.F.K. or Reagan. So there.

"MURPHY BROWN" AND "DESIGNING WOMEN": A comedy tandem that ranks with the best

FREDDY IS BACK FOR CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON

<TEXT>
<P>
If you want to find your Christmas-week movies at the video store rather than 
contend with the crowds at the theaters, it'll help if you're a fan of Jerry 
Lee Lewis, Freddy Krueger, the "Star Trek" crew or Almodovar. 
</P>
<P>
Almodovar is how Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's name is often shortened in 
the credits for his offbeat films, and the most popular of his outrageous, 
Bunuel-on-speed comedies, "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" is new to 
videocassette this week (Orion, $79.98, R). The surreal farce about a woman who 
entertains several odd visitors after losing her lover stars Carmen Maura and 
Fernando Guillen. 
</P>
<P>
Also just out is a horror film that might have been subtitled "Teen-Agers on 
the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" (but wasn't) -- "Nightmare on Elm Street 5: 
The Dream Child" (Media, $89.95, R). Robert Englund once again does his thing 
as dream-haunting slasher Freddy Krueger. The tape includes a rap video by the 
group Whodini, if that's a big selling point to you. 
</P>
<P>
"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" (Paramount, no list price, PG) shows the 
sci-fi series well past the verge of overextending its welcome, especially with 
William Shatner directing (flaccidly) instead of Leonard Nimoy. But if you're a 
Trekkie set on collecting all of the films, at least wait a few months until 
Paramount reduces this one to the $15-$30 range. That "no list price" means 
that you'd have to pay almost $100 for it now. 
</P>
<P>
"Great Balls of Fire!" (Orion, $89.98, PG-13) seemed to evoke the same 
descriptive word from every critic who reviewed it earlier this year: cartoon. 
They didn't mean that this film about singer-pianist-wild man Jerry Lee Lewis' 
rise and fall was animated by the folks who did "Roger Rabbit"; they meant that 
it treated Lewis' fascinating story (focusing on his marriage to his 
13-year-old second cousin) colorfully but superficially. Dennis Quaid stars. 
</P>
<P>
Other new-to-video movies: "La Lectrice" (Orion, $79.98, R) is a clever, 
whimsical comedy starring Miou-Miou. It's all about, believe it or not, 
reading. Michel Deville directed. 
</P>
<P>
"Lock Up" (IVE, $89.95, R) is a prison drama for die-hard Sylvester Stallone 
fans only. 
</P>
<P>
"How I Got into College" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG-13) satirizes college recruitment 
and stars Corey Parker, Christopher Rydell and Anthony Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
"Renegades" (MCA, $89.95, R) boasts a heavyweight bunch of brat-packers (Kiefer 
Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Jami Gertz) in a weakly scripted cop/buddy 
film. TERRY ATKINSON

RESTLESS RECORDS LOOKS TO THE '70S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The focus of most independent U.S. record labels when reissuing material on CD 
has been on American or British recordings from the '50s and '60s -- possibly 
because of the proven nostalgia audience for these records. 
</P>
<P>
As we move into the '90s, however, it only seems right to step more 
aggressively in the reissue program to the '70s, and that's one of the things 
Restless Records has in mind in its new Restless Retro series. 
</P>
<P>
The Culver City independent has already released nine albums by the Buzzcocks, 
Stiff Little Fingers and Wire -- innovative groups that were influenced, to 
varying degrees, by the energy and anyone-can-start-a-band punk spirit of the 
Sex Pistols. In addition, Restless has 15 albums on the way by Can, the 
progressive German rock band. The first nine are due in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make available in CD (and cassette) music that we feel was 
important and innovative in its time and remains influential today," said David 
Gerber, vice president and general manger of Restless. 
</P>
<P>
The Wire albums -- "Pink Flag," "Chairs Missing," "154" and the retrospective 
"On Returning" -- were from the British group's early and most influential 
period in the late '70s, while the four Stiff Little Fingers collections 
include "Inflammable Material," regarded by many rock critics as one of the 
punk-era classics. The other albums by the Belfast group are "Nobody's Heroes," 
"Hanx!" and "Go for It." 
</P>
<P>
But the most impressive of the initial releases is "Product," a three-disc 
boxed set saluting the Buzzcocks, the band co-founded by Pete Shelley (who 
later, as a solo artist, recorded the techno-dance classic "Homosapien"). 
</P>
<P>
It's hard for anyone who has heard the Fine Young Cannibals' version of "Ever 
Fallen in Love" to imagine that the writers of the song were in a punk band. 
Yet the opening tracks in this 61-song collection show how very much the 
Buzzcocks were involved in the punk movement. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the early days, however, the Buzzcocks -- who just came through 
Southern California on a reunion tour -- mixed punk energy with an undeniable 
pop sensibility that suggested an equal influence of David Bowie and T. Rex. 
</P>
<P>
"Product" contains all of the Buzzcocks' studio recordings (including the 
original version of "Ever Fallen in Love") plus a 24-minute live recording and 
one song previously available only on a British sampler. 
</P>
<P>
BACK TO THE '50s AND '60s: Chameleon Records, another Los Angeles area 
independent, has just released the first five titles in a "Vee Jay Hall of 
Fame" series saluting the historic Chicago label. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1952, Vee Jay specialized in Southern blues acts, Midwestern R&amp;B 
groups and gospel attractions, but entered the rock market occasionally -- as 
with the 1964 release of the Beatles' "Please Please Me." 
</P>
<P>
The first five "Hall of Fame" entries feature late '50s or '60s recordings by 
Jerry Butler, John Lee Hooker, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, Little Richard and 
Jimmy Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Though Butler, Knight and Hooker are often associated with other record 
companies, each did noteworthy work on Vee Jay or affiliated labels. But the 
Little Richard package consists mostly of inferior reworkings of the songs -- 
including "Long Tall Sally" and "Tutti Frutti" -- that were hits for the rock 
pioneer earlier on Specialty Records. 
</P>
<P>
The Reed collection may be the most satisfying because the bluesman had his 
greatest commercial success on Vee Jay -- 18 Top 20 R&amp;B hits between 1955 
and 1961. Among the ones included in the CD: "Bright Lights, Big City," "Baby, 
What You Want Me to Do" and "You Got Me Dizzy."

AMERICANS STRONGLY BACK BUSH ON PANAMA INVASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Americans strongly support the massive U.S. invasion of Panama and agree with 
President Bush that "it's been worth it" despite the loss of American lives, 
The Times Poll found Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
If Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega manages to escape capture, however, 
this enthusiasm could cool some. And the public does not believe the invasion 
has made life any safer for the 35,000 Americans in Panama, the survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
Two reasons cited by Bush for unleashing the largest U.S. invasion force since 
the Vietnam war were "to bring General Noriega to justice in the United 
States," where he is wanted on drug-trafficking charges, and "to safeguard the 
lives of American citizens." 
</P>
<P>
But Americans think the invasion has accomplished two other goals enunciated by 
Bush: "To defend democracy" and to protect U.S. rights under the Panama Canal 
Treaties. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll, directed by I. A. Lewis, interviewed 700 adult Americans by 
telephone Thursday afternoon and night. The margin of error for a survey this 
size is five percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tendency for Americans to rally 'round the flag whenever U.S. armed 
forces are first sent into battle," pollster Lewis noted. "But if the situation 
drags on, the public could easily become more critical. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are measuring now is mostly first impressions. A number of factors 
will have a lot to do with the final public attitude -- things like how quickly 
Noriega is captured, the extent of American casualties, the reaction of other 
Latin American governments and how soon American troops can pull out." 
</P>
<P>
But on the second day of the invasion by more than 20,000 U.S. Marines, 
paratroopers, infantrymen, sailors and airmen, American citizens interviewed by 
The Times Poll were supporting the attack by a ratio of more than 5 to 1, with 
77% approving and only 15% disapproving. In fact, 56% approved "strongly." 
</P>
<P>
Politically for Bush, coming on the heels of a generally successful summit 
meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the invasion seems to have 
increased his popularity. Eighty percent now approve of how the President is 
"handling his job," compared to 66% during a pre-summit survey by The Times 
Poll and just 59% last March. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's poll, two-thirds of those interviewed agreed with Bush's 
statement at a press conference a few hours earlier that the invasion had "been 
worth it" despite the loss of American lives. As of late Thursday, the Pentagon 
was reporting U.S. combat casualties of 21 dead, 208 wounded and four missing. 
</P>
<P>
But nearly a third of the people surveyed said they will consider the invasion 
to be "less successful" if Noriega is not captured. On Thursday, Bush vowed to 
keep U.S. troops hunting for Noriega "as long as it takes." And in the survey, 
people on the average said they expect that it will be nine months before 
American forces can be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly a third of the people also worried that U.S. troops could get "bogged 
down" in Panama as they did a generation ago in Vietnam, although nearly 
two-thirds thought this to be unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring their concern for the safety of possible American hostages in 
Panama, half of those surveyed feared that the invasion had "further 
jeopardized" U.S. citizens living there. Only 37% felt that American lives had 
been made "more secure." 
</P>
<P>
But half believed that the attack had resulted in a more secure Panama Canal. 
Less than one-third thought it was now in further jeopardy. Only about 1 in 6 
advocated scrapping the Panama Canal Treaties, which call for turning over the 
canal and U.S. military bases to Panamanian control on Dec. 31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly 6 in 10 people said the U.S. military operation "has brought democracy 
closer to realization in Panama," where a new government was sworn in as the 
invasion began. 
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing their approval of the attack, a majority of people considered it to 
be "morally justified." And two-thirds asserted that the United States had 
"made every effort to negotiate a peaceful settlement" before invading.

BUSH CARVING OWN ROLE AS TOP COMMANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Marine riflemen, Army paratroopers and Navy SEALS already moving through 
the darkness toward Panama, President Bush went over the final invasion plans 
one last time Tuesday night. At 4 a.m. Wednesday, he was still awake in his 
White House study when aides came to suggest an early morning televised address 
to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of substantial casualties on both sides were pouring in, and Bush was 
eager to explain his decision to send U.S. troops against the regime of 
Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega. The President readily agreed to go on 
television at 7 a.m. After a quick walk to his living quarters and a two-hour 
nap, he was back in the Oval Office by 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very concerned about the loss of life," said a senior government 
official, "but he also understands the role of the military and that they take 
those risks with pride." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, by turns open and secretive, somber and bantering, is putting his own 
characteristic stamp on one role an American President shares with no one else: 
commander in chief of the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Outwardly he has made almost a fetish of sticking to a business-as-usual 
schedule since he met secretly with aides Sunday night to approve specific 
plans for the massive military strike. But behind the scenes, he has stayed in 
close touch with the unfolding events in Panama. He was not only deeply 
involved in the military planning; he also has been closely monitoring the 
results of the operation at every stage. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for Bush and for every President, the decision to send military forces into 
action is a plunge into the unknown and the unknowable. Such action tests a 
President's personal and political balance, his judgment and credibility, and 
ultimately his relationship with the people who elected him. 
</P>
<P>
When U.S. forces go into combat, Presidents normally enjoy a surge of support 
as the public and Congress rally round the flag. Historically, sustaining that 
support has often proved difficult -- especially if a conflict drags on and 
casualties continue. 
</P>
<P>
For Bush, that longer-term political challenge may be particularly great in 
Panama because the tiny nation's economy and governmental structures have been 
shattered by the U.S. assault, and the depth of resistance -- fueled in part by 
the anti-Americanism endemic in Latin America -- has surprised U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
The President himself is well aware of these factors, said a senior aide, who 
described Bush as "intense but unemotional" Sunday as he questioned military 
officials about their plans to invade Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew it was a major decision for Panama and the United States, for his 
Administration and for history," the aide said. "From Sunday afternoon until 
today (Thursday), it has been a sober time for him." 
</P>
<P>
And by all accounts, he has gone about his job as commander-in-chief with 
almost supreme self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
As he put it at an impromptu news conference Thursday, Bush intends "to conduct 
the foreign policy of this country the way I think best. If the American people 
don't like it, I expect they'll get somebody else to take my job, but I'm going 
to keep doing it." 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter asked if "it was really worth it to send people to their death" 
for the military objectives, Bush declared that Defense Department officials 
had been candid about the potential for casualties, adding: "And every human 
life is precious and yet I have to answer, yes, it has been worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Bush acknowledged at his news conference that he had been "extraordinarily 
frustrated" that Noriega had clung to power despite intense U.S. pressure. The 
aide said the President had made up his mind to take some kind of action 
against Noriega even before the Sunday afternoon White House meeting at which 
he decided to launch a massive military strike. 
</P>
<P>
"He made a decision, a hard one and a very firm one, and he never wavered from 
it," said a senior government official. "He believed the time had come to act, 
and there was no question of anyone trying to argue him out of it or anything. 
He said: 'Let's do it. If we don't, it'll only get worse.' And people snapped 
to." 
</P>
<P>
The question then became: What kind of action? At the White House meeting, Bush 
listened intently as Army Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, outlined military options, including a possible "surgical strike" that 
would involve a limited number of troops whose mission would be to seize 
Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Aides said that the President quickly became convinced that massive force was 
the best way both to limit casualties and to achieve the broader objectives of 
protecting Americans in Panama and installing a new government headed by 
Guillermo Endara, the apparent winner of a May election that Noriega aborted. 
</P>
<P>
Bush closely questioned Powell and other military officials about the details 
of their plan for a massive attack. One aide said that he asked such questions 
as: "Well, why do you want to take that building? And how long does it take to 
get from the airport to the site of the attack?" In particular, Bush carefully 
analyzed the potential risk to civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Although the President has remained in almost constant contact with 
developments in Panama, he has managed to keep a regular schedule on other 
matters. He has gone to great lengths to give the appearance of business as 
usual at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
He has told staffers and other Administration officials that they should not 
let the Panama situation interfere with their Christmas plans. When Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III asked Bush whether he should cancel his plans to 
return to his home in Texas for the holidays, the President told him it would 
not be necessary to remain in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has not let the Panama situation interfere with his own Christmas 
schedule. He plans to spend Christmas at Camp David, the presidential retreat 
in Maryland, and leave two days later for a week's visit to Texas. There he 
will go to the Beeville ranch of his friend Will Farish, where he traditionally 
spends the holidays between Christmas and New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the President may stop off at 
the military hospital in San Antonio where servicemen wounded in Panama are 
being treated. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how the President manages to keep his equilibrium under such 
pressure," said a senior government official. "I've seen a lot of frayed nerves 
during this Panama stuff, but not his. In times of stress, he seems to get 
cooler and quieter, which is a good signal for people to pay attention and do 
what they're supposed to do. Some people who are under pressure beat up on 
other people, but not the President." 
</P>
<P>
Aides said that Bush realizes he still faces tremendous problems: the potential 
for even more casualties, a Panamanian government that will require 
considerable U.S. aid just to survive, Noriega's continued potential to cause 
problems as long as he remains at large and a possible adverse reaction by the 
American public if Panama remains a long-term drain on American resources. 
</P>
<P>
"He still has some anxieties because there are a lot of problems and potential 
problems still out there," one White House official said. "But he's genuinely 
pleased about the way the military performed, and he has assured himself that 
what he is doing is the right thing and realistic under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
And Bush's own informal style of communicating with the public could also pose 
a problem. His tendency to minimize the significance of events and dampen 
expectations might not serve him well during a military crisis. 
</P>
<P>
At his news conference Thursday, Bush projected his familiar image: a man at 
ease and able to joke, confident that matters are under control. 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, however, the bodies of soldiers killed in Panama were being 
unloaded at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Viewers of CBS and CNN saw Bush 
smiling on one side of the screen, while on the other side Marine color guards 
were escorting caskets off C-141 Starlifter planes. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater called the juxtaposition "unfortunate" and said that the networks 
were "unfair" not to tell the President they intended to show the arriving 
caskets side by side with the news conference.

U.S. invasion forces, completing the conquest of Panama's military bases, moved 
Thursday into the ravaged streets of Panama City to root out Manuel A. 
Noriega's paramilitary Dignity Battalion and end the chaos and looting that 
have racked the Panamanian capital. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega remained at large, possibly in the countryside. Officials in Washington 
and Panama sorted through hundreds of tips about him but said that they are 
sure of only one thing -- that he has not been able to get out of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"The operation is not over, but it's pretty well wrapped up," President Bush 
declared. "Gen. Noriega is no longer in power. He no longer commands the 
instruments of government or the forces of repression that he used for so long 
to brutalize the Panamanian people." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that the United States would keep up the hunt "as long as it takes" 
to bring Noriega to justice. In older neighborhoods of Panama City, U.S. troops 
moved house to house in a search for weapons and armed militia loyal to the 
military strongman, who went into hiding as Army paratroopers and Marines 
launched the massive invasion late Tuesday and early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
News agencies reported Thursday night that U.S. planes strafed a pocket of 
resistance in San Miguelito, a working-class suburb of Panama City where 
militiamen fiercely loyal to Noriega are garrisoned. Troops in armored 
personnel carriers shouted over megaphones for residents near the garrison to 
evacuate, the Associated Press said, and sporadic machine-gun fire could be 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Pentagon, the U.S. military casualty toll in the assault, the 
largest single American military operation since the Vietnam War, climbed to 21 
killed and 208 wounded. The Pentagon said that four American military personnel 
are missing. 
</P>
<P>
In Panama City, however, Lt. Col James L. Swank, a spokesman for the 
Panama-based Southern Command, told reporters that 18 American servicemen had 
died, 190 were wounded and one was missing. An Air Force source in Panama, who 
asked not to be identified, told The Times that the number of dead servicemen 
might climb to "at least double that." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty? he was asked.

<P>
"Yes," replied the source, who is based with the Southern Command and in a 
position to see the bodies leave Howard Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, an American school teacher in Panama, Gertrude Kandi Helin, 43, 
was killed at the start of the fighting early Wednesday. She was struck on the 
way home from dinner by machine-gun fire from a Panama Defense Forces' 
position, a relative said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said that 59 Panamanian soldiers were killed, 66 were wounded and 
more than 1,500 were taken prisoner. Panamanian hospital officials were quoted 
as saying that hundreds of civilians were treated for wounds suffered during 
"Operation Just Cause" assaults in heavily populated areas near the destroyed 
headquarters of the Panama Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
On the crowded streets of Panama City, looters went on a daylong binge, 
smashing shop windows and hauling away goods from hundreds of stores. In the 
alleys and sidewalks of shantytowns, makeshift stalls were set up for looters 
to hawk their wares. 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Endara, the opposition leader installed as president just before the 
invasion began, emerged briefly from hiding at midday Thursday under heavy U.S. 
guard. While gunfire rang out across the capital, he clamped a curfew on Panama 
to last until 6 a.m. today and ordered all public and private establishments 
closed through the end of today in an attempt to restore public order after 24 
hours of massive looting. But his actions, witnessed by a group of U.S. 
soldiers and 200 opposition politicians, appeared to have no immediate impact. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview on ABC's "Nightline" program Thursday night, Endara 
said he hoped to have a new police force, composed largely of "good officers" 
from the Panama Defense Forces, fully in place within a month. Endara expressed 
confidence that the new government would be able to establish itself even if 
Noriega remained at large. "The people are not hiding Noriega," Endara said. 
"Noriega knows that the people don't want him and don't like him." 
</P>
<P>
The 51-mile Panama Canal, closed Wednesday for other than operational reasons 
for the first time in its 75-year history, was open Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
White House and Pentagon officials said that American forces by Thursday 
morning had gained two targets that eluded them in the initial hours of the 
invasion: About 100 troops secured the luxury Marriott Hotel in Panama City, 
while other units gained control of Panama's modernistic Legislative Palace. 
</P>
<P>
As the soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division evacuated more than 100 guests 
from the hotel, where a number of foreigners had been seized by armed Noriega 
loyalists, Panamanians opened fire from a passing car, wounding at least one 
U.S. soldier in the chest and stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Frightened guests waiting to be evacuated in Army trucks dived for cover in 
panic, while heavily armed U.S. troops, their faces covered with camouflage 
paint, returned the fire, Reuters news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a Spanish news photographer had been killed at the hotel. One report 
in Panama City was that he got caught in a brief cross-fire between two groups 
of American troops. But according to another report, he was killed in hostile 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press reported from Panama City that the photographer was in a 
group of journalists in the hotel parking lot when a U.S. armored personnel 
carrier approached. U.S. troops inside the hotel, apparently thinking the 
approaching carrier belonged to Panamanian forces, yelled at the journalists to 
get out of the way and opened fire. The AP, quoting Maruja Torres, a Spanish 
news correspondent, said the approaching carrier returned the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration appeared to have three goals on the second day of the 
operation, which a Pentagon official estimated would cost "hundreds of millions 
of dollars." The goals were to seize Noriega, restore order to the streets and 
establish a functioning government led by Endara. In the Administration's view, 
Endara is the rightful Panamanian president, elected last May in balloting that 
Noriega annulled after it became clear that his puppet candidate was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Eduardo Herrera Hassan, a former aide to the late Gen. Omar Torrijos, 
Noriega's predecessor, was said to have returned to Panama -- almost certainly 
with U.S. assistance -- to take over the Panama Defense Forces. Herrera is an 
Israeli-trained intelligence agent who fled to Miami for his life after losing 
a power struggle with Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"Herrera is the only one with the prestige, the leadership and the knowledge to 
order PDF troops back into uniform and back into their barracks and to tell 
them, 'It's a whole new ballgame,' " said one U.S. military officer with 
extensive experience in Panama. "Without him, we'll see bloodshed for months as 
the PDF tries to regroup." 
</P>
<P>
"Endara's going to need loyal troops who recognize the constitution and the 
fairness and the legitimacy of his election," Bush said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that some of the combat troops might be home 
by Christmas on Monday, an estimate that White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said might be overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, military police units are expected to face a long-term assignment 
as they seek to establish order on streets where elements of Noriega's 
now-scattered Dignity Battalion once had reigned. 
</P>
<P>
And Bush said that the operation -- which almost doubled the U.S. military 
population in Panama from 12,000 to 22,500 -- is "open-ended" in terms of the 
hunt for Noriega, who faces drug-trafficking charges in two federal courts in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"His picture will be in every post office in town. That's the way it works. He 
is a fugitive drug dealer and we want to see him brought to justice," Bush 
declared when asked about the $1-million reward that the U.S. government is 
offering for information leading to Noriega's capture. "If there is some 
incentive for some Panamanian to turn him in, that's . . . a million bucks that 
I would be very happy to sign the check for." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the Pentagon believes Noriega is ill-equipped to hide out for long in 
the countryside because he lacks "the communications or a PDF-continued 
loyalty" that he would need to survive with a fighting force. 
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations, meanwhile, Eduardo Vallarino, a self-exiled Panamanian 
businessman who is Endara's designated envoy, said that if Noriega is captured, 
he should be tried in Panama rather than being extradited to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The President expressed appreciation for support offered by Congress, some of 
the other nations of this Hemisphere, its allies and the American public. 
</P>
<P>
But praise was far from universal: there were scattered protests around the 
United States and loud complaints throughout Latin America, with Peru backing 
out of an Andean drug summit that Bush plans to attend in Cartagena, Colombia, 
in February. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, said that American attempts to 
explain why it launched the invasion were little more than a "propaganda smoke 
screen." 
</P>
<P>
The President, who said in October that he did not think a large military 
operation in Panama to overthrow Noriega would be prudent, said Thursday that 
he changed his mind after the slaying Saturday of an unarmed, off-duty U.S. 
Marine officer and the mistreatment of a Navy lieutenant and his wife by 
elements of the Panama Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
If the Soviets do not understand the reasons for the operation, he said, "I 
need to get on a wire there (and) explain this to Mr. (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev," 
the Soviet president. 
</P>
<P>
"If they kill an American Marine, that's real bad. And if they threaten and 
brutalize the wife of an American citizen, sexually threatening the 
lieutenant's wife while kicking him in the groin over and over again, then, Mr. 
Gorbachev, please understand, this President is going to do something about 
it," Bush said at a hastily called White House news conference. 
</P>
<P>
In Managua, four armored personnel carriers and Nicaraguan soldiers armed with 
AK-47 automatic rifles ringed the U.S. Embassy in retaliation for the reported 
stationing of U.S. troops outside the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies in Panama. 
The troops took up the positions in Panama City after rumors spread through the 
capital that Noriega might try to go into hiding in one of those diplomatic 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
In the fog of the continued gunfire and chaos in the streets, U.S. officials 
were uncertain how many Americans remained captive of Panamanian forces. An FBI 
hostage rescue team, the civilian version of the Army's elite Delta Force, was 
dispatched to Panama, a Pentagon official said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said an undetermined number of Americans may be held by Noriega loyalists 
hoping that they could be traded for safe passage out of the country. The 
Pentagon said it was investigating "about a dozen" cases of American civilians 
who were unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven scientists and technicians working on a Smithsonian Institution project 
in the San Blas Islands off Panama were released Thursday. They had been seized 
by the Panama Defense Forces on Wednesday.

Security forces armed with automatic weapons fired into crowds of protesters in 
the Romanian capital of Bucharest on Thursday, killing or wounding an 
undetermined number of demonstrators demanding an end to the rule of dictator 
Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter for Tanjug, the Yugoslav news agency, said several thousand 
demonstrators, mainly schoolchildren and university students, were surrounded 
by police and tanks at a main intersection near the Inter-Continental Hotel in 
the center of Bucharest. Peter Tomic, a Yugoslav journalist, said he saw an 
armored vehicle crush two students. When others rushed to their aid, security 
forces opened fire, killing or wounding about 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department quoted U. S. Embassy officials in Bucharest 
as saying that at least 13 young people had been killed in the demonstration 
just two blocks from the embassy. Budapest Radio reported 32 more demonstrators 
were killed in the northern city of Cluj. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet news agency Tass reported at midnight that the sounds of gunfire 
from automatic weapons could still be heard echoing in the center of the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
"There is light in all the windows of buildings in the areas where the 
demonstrations are under way. People have come out onto balconies and some of 
them are shouting slogans supporting the protests," the report added. 
</P>
<P>
Reports on the second assault on unarmed civilians in five days came mostly 
from such East Bloc news organizations, among the few foreign news services 
reporting from Romania, which has been sealed off to foreigners since Monday, 
as the Ceausescu regime faced what could be its terminal crisis after 24 years 
in power. 
</P>
<P>
Gunfire was also reported to have broken out at a demonstration in the city of 
Arad in western Romania, about 40 miles from the western city of Timisoara, 
where security forces opened fire on demonstrators Sunday. Estimates of the 
death toll in Timisoara range from a few hundred to as high as 4,000, but there 
has been no independent confirmation of the casualties. Even East Bloc 
journalists, attempting to reach Timisoara, have been turned back from the 
town. 
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug correspondent, reporting on Belgrade Radio, said the confrontation 
in Bucharest had turned into a "bloody riot." 
</P>
<P>
Before its midnight report, Tass said, "Along the central street of the 
capital, tanks are moving, following the lines of submachine gunners pushing 
back the crowds. Bursts of automatic weapons fire are being heard. 
Panic-stricken people are hiding in doorways and courtyards." 
</P>
<P>
Tass added that "a great many fire brigade trucks and military trucks with 
personnel are being concentrated in the central part of the Romanian capital," 
and approaches to Communist Party headquarters and Ceausescu's presidential 
palace were blocked by heavily armed army units. 
</P>
<P>
Tass reported that students had gathered late into the night on the grounds of 
the university and had called for a general strike today. It said the students 
claimed to have sent representatives to factories to urge workers to join the 
strike. It added that anti-government leaflets have appeared on walls in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu, 71, whose disregard of human rights has ranked him among the most 
notorious dictators on the globe, told Romanians in a speech Wednesday night 
that the demonstrations in Timisoara were inspired by "fascists" and 
"international espionage centers." 
</P>
<P>
He issued no warnings about further action against demonstrations, but defended 
the actions of security forces in Timisoara. 
</P>
<P>
With the country so effectively sealed off, accounts of the Timisoara events 
have come only at a trickle and are of uncertain reliability. But some of them 
begin to suggest that Ceausescu may be facing a problem in keeping army and 
police units loyal to his cause. 
</P>
<P>
A Yugoslav newspaper reported that a truck driver, returning to Yugoslavia from 
Timisoara, said security officers publicly executed soldiers who refused to 
shoot at the demonstrators. He did not say when the executions took place, or 
how many people were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Two other sources reported that the demonstrators in Timisoara managed to take 
control of at least two tanks during the protests. A woman resident of 
Timisoara, whose taped interview was broadcast on Hungarian television 
Wednesday night, said protesters seized at least five tanks. Armored units then 
opened fire on the captured tanks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
According to one Austrian physician, who was visiting relatives in the western 
city and who spoke with the Romanian section of Radio Free Europe, the 
demonstrations started last Saturday when protesters broke shop windows, looted 
stores, attacked the local government center and burned books written by 
Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations continued Sunday, when large forces of heavily armed 
security troops arrived with tanks and armored personnel carriers. Throughout 
the day, the tension mounted steadily, until about 8 p.m., when, the witness 
said, he found himself among ranks of demonstrators confronting the security 
forces. His account goes on: 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, machine guns and shotguns started rattling. In a few seconds, 30-40 
people fell in front of me, wounded or dead. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The crowds tried to withdraw. But the thousands at the back were advancing, 
chanting slogans. So that, to our astonishment, the rows were allowed to pass, 
moving toward the center of the town by the thousands. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Afterwards, the riot in the center of the town was in full swing. Shops were 
set on fire. Slogans were chanted. The mood was that of a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"The machine guns and shotguns kept rattling until 4 o'clock in the morning. 
Hundreds upon hundreds of wounded and dead were carried to the nearby 
hospitals. . . . Toward 4 o'clock, many people had withdrawn. There had been a 
great many wounded. There were heaps of dead and blood all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
"Early next day, the city was relatively quiet. But tanks, soldiers, militia 
men were everywhere. Thousands of people stood around bewildered, dumbfounded . 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
International condemnation of the Ceausescu regime continued to grow Thursday, 
isolating him from even his East Bloc allies. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian government revoked its 1948 friendship treaty with Romania, as 
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn rejected Ceausescu's charges that 
Hungary had helped to incite the unrest in Romania. However, Horn said Hungary 
would not break diplomatic relations with Bucharest, in the interest of 
offering at least some assistance to the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians living 
in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry summoned the Romanian ambassador to register 
its displeasure. The evening news in Prague opened with the sound of gunfire in 
Bucharest and reports of protesters chanting slogans and singing patriotic 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, the parliament and the government newspaper issued denunciations of 
the Romanian government's use of violence against protesters. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called on Romania to 
"cease the brutal repression of the Romanian people," reopen its sealed borders 
and observe its international treaties on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United States has tried 
repeatedly but failed to deliver a formal protest. The U.S. ambassador to 
Romania, Alan Green, had been turned away repeatedly and Deputy Secretary of 
State Lawrence S. Eagleburger had been rebuffed in his efforts to invite the 
Romanian ambassador in Washington to a meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have summoned the Romanian ambassador to come to the department tomorrow 
(today) to receive our protest," Boucher added. 
</P>
<P>
The United States also said it will re-evaluate its trade relations with 
Romania, with which it does about $300 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Only China, which last June dealt with its own pro-democracy demonstrations 
with the same force now being used by the Ceausescu regime, refrained from 
criticism, calling the Romanian events an "internal matter." 
</P>
<P>
On a visit to East Berlin, French President Francois Mitterrand described the 
Ceausescu government as "a regime of personal, family power that has no honest 
reason to remain. I think that the days of this regime, in a Europe full of 
movement, are numbered. But at what price?" 
</P>
<P>
The price could get even higher if Ceausescu, backed by his widely despised 
wife Elena and about 50 members of his family placed in key positions 
throughout the government, remains determined to use force. 
</P>
<P>
The East German army, according to a report on ADN, the East German news 
service, appealed Thursday to Romanian soldiers to refrain from using arms 
against their fellow citizens. The appeal points to an issue that must now be a 
primary Ceausescu concern: How far can the loyalties of his security forces and 
military be pushed? 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Ceausescu has carefully weeded out the higher echelons of the 
military to eliminate any officers whose devotion to his service might be 
suspect. Diplomatic analysts say that officers who received military training 
in the Soviet Union were among those shunted aside. One of Ceausescu's 
brothers, Ilie, is a general and the deputy defense minister. Another, Nicolae 
Andruta, is a police general and deputy interior minister. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, there have been vague and unconfirmed rumors of discontent 
among the army's officer corps, but, in a country whose key institutions are 
riddled by security department agents, the existence of an anti-Ceausescu cabal 
has always seemed unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
But it also seems unlikely that the Romanian military would be able to sustain 
for very long Ceausescu's policy of shooting into crowds of fellow citizens. 
</P>
<P>
It was also uncertain whether protesters would continue to defy the security 
forces in obvious risk of their lives in order to dislodge the Ceausescu 
dynasty. Thursday's demonstrators in Bucharest were undeterred even though they 
were aware of the blood bath reported in Timisoara. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucharest protest began with a small crowd of young people who were 
immediately joined by hundreds of others marching to a pro-government rally, 
where Ceausescu was speaking to a crowd of factory workers, bused in for a show 
of support, according to Tanjug. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu's speech was being broadcast on the radio, but Tanjug said the 
transmission was interrupted as the demonstrators approached the rally site. 
The protesters, defying security agents who rushed forward to photograph them, 
began to hoot and shout at Ceausescu. Then his speech was interrupted by what 
sounded like a piercing scream. 
</P>
<P>
For about three minutes, the radio played patriotic music, then resumed 
Ceausescu's speech in mid-sentence.

GAS TAX PLAN RUNS INTO FOE; 
</P>
<P>
BALLOT MEASURE: OPPOSITION BY THE BUILDING INDUSTRY COULD THREATEN VOTER 
APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSED INCREASE.

<TEXT>
<P>
A politically powerful association of builders and developers Thursday became 
the first major interest group to announce its opposition to a proposed 
9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase that voters are being asked to endorse 
next June. 
</P>
<P>
The 7,000-member California Building Industry Assn. said it will campaign 
against the gas tax hike because it is part of a transportation improvement 
plan that places new responsibilities on developers to help reduce traffic 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in support of the overall gas tax increase concept, but our members 
cannot accept this legislation because of the unworkable congestion-management 
program," said Owen R. Waters, the association's senior staff vice president 
for governmental affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Waters said the decision to formally oppose the gas tax increase came after 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), the author of the congestion-management 
plan, refused to accept changes that the developers considered critical. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been treated well here recently and . . . we ain't going to take it 
any more," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
Surprised by the association's decision, Katz reacted angrily, accusing the 
developers of letting their own desire to make a profit overshadow the need to 
make congestion management an important element in any future land use 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
"The association is putting the greed of their members above the needs of the 
people of California," he said. "What you have here is a classic case of 
special interest, in this case developers who will build on every corner and 
level every mountain to make a profit." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had offered to modify the proposal, but what the developers wanted 
in effect was "a process whereby they can get out of the whole thing, and we're 
not going to do that for them." 
</P>
<P>
Just three weeks ago, the influential California Teachers Assn. announced that 
it also was contemplating similar opposition, although it did not go so far as 
to take a formal position. 
</P>
<P>
The gas tax increase, designed to help finance the 10-year transportation 
improvement program, is tied to a proposed constitutional amendment that would 
modify the state's spending limit. Voter approval of the constitutional 
amendment in June would trigger the gas tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
Both measures are part of a delicate compromise reached by Gov. George 
Deukmejian and Republican and Democratic legislative leaders last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition of either interest group presents a dilemma for Deukmejian and 
the legislative leaders, who promised each other that they would make no major 
changes that would jeopardize the compromise. At the same time, they have been 
told by political experts that strong opposition from any interest group could 
kill the measures' chances of passage. 
</P>
<P>
Then, to make matters worse, if lawmakers capitulate to the developers, they 
face the potential of losing support from environmentalists. Sierra Club 
officials, particularly, have said that they would actively oppose the gas tax 
measure if the congestion-management program is "tinkered with." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), the sponsor of the spending-limit 
proposal, said lawmakers will have to try to find a "common ground" with the 
teachers and the developers. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition from the teacher group stems from its concern that modifications 
in the spending limit would mean that schools would get less money than they 
are now entitled to get. 
</P>
<P>
"My attitude is that we have to resolve the problem," Garamendi said. "We 
cannot afford to have significant opposition. Both these groups are very 
significant." 
</P>
<P>
But Katz said he did not consider the opposition of the developers to be a 
significant threat to the passage of the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to choose between alienation of environmentalists or developers, I'll 
fight with developers every time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While applauding the goal of Katz's congestion management program, developers 
contend that it is so complex that neither developers nor governments could 
make it work. 
</P>
<P>
The program requires local governments to assess the effect that proposed new 
developments would have on traffic congestion and then reach an agreement with 
the developer to mitigate the impact. The mitigation could take several forms, 
including the payment of fees to local governments to be used to expand the 
transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
The transportation improvement program is a comprehensive plan to relieve 
traffic gridlock, and includes the gas tax increase, the construction of new 
highways, expansion of mass transit and the congestion-management proposal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
A proposal to increase the state's gasoline tax 9 cents per gallon was approved 
by Gov. George Deukmejian and the Legislature last summer as part of a 
compromise that also provides for modifications in the state spending limit. 
The gas tax increase cannot go into effect, however, unless voters approve the 
spending limit changes next June. Revenue from the tax increase would be used 
to help finance a 10-year, $18.5-billion transportation improvement program.

PANAMA UPDATE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fighting 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops, completing the conquest of Panama's military bases, moved into the 
streets of Panama City to root out members of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's 
paramilitary Dignity Battalions and end the chaos that has racked the capital. 
Noriega remained at large, possibly in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Law and Order 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Endara, the opposition leader installed as president just before the 
U.S. invasion began, emerged from hiding to impose a curfew on the country and 
order the closing of all public and private establishments through today. With 
Panama's combined army and police force disabled, the capital has been struck 
by massive looting. 
</P>
<P>
Americans 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said it is investigating reports of about a dozen Americans who 
may be held hostage by Noriega loyalists. President Bush said some of Noriega's 
supporters may attempt to trade hostages for safe conduct out of the country. 
CBS News said one of its producers has not been heard from since Wednesday 
night, when gunmen abducted him from the Marriott Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Casualties 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one American servicemen have been reported killed, including two 
Californians, and more than 208 wounded. U.S. military planes began airlifting 
bodies to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and wounded to military hospitals in 
San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
The Reaction 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union again denounced the invasion, calling Washington's explanation 
a "propaganda smoke screen."In Latin America, only El Salvador, heavily 
dependent on U.S. military aid, called the action "justifiable." 
</P>
<P>
Other world reaction was generally divided along ideological lines, with 
Western allies expressing understanding while East Bloc and nonaligned nations 
generally condemned the attack.

MILITARY: AMERICANS MUST CONTEND WITH ELUSIVE REMNANTS OF NORIEGA'S 
BEST-TRAINED TROOPS AND ROAMING BANDS OF YOUTHS.

<P>
A day after subduing most organized resistance mounted by the Panama Defense 
Forces against their invasion, U.S. soldiers confronted one of the most shadowy 
and uncertain phases of their mission Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
As the American troops moved to restore order to a Panama City turned lawless, 
they faced the elusive remnants of some of ex-strongman Manuel A. Noriega's 
best-trained troops, as well as some of his most unpredictable, who are 
shooting from rooftops, entering houses and roaming the streets in disorganized 
bands. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Noriega's special operations forces, many wearing black masks, are 
sniping from rooftop perches, Pentagon officials said. Meanwhile, a rabble from 
the so-called Dignity Battalion, some armed with AK-47 rifles and 
rocket-propelled grenade launchers, threaten U.S. troops from the cover of 
buildings. The Dignity Battalion consists of young, paramilitary Noriega 
loyalists recruited from poor neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to take down the PDF; we've pretty effectively done that," said Army 
Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, director of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff. "We 
wanted to restore law and order. We're doing that today (Thursday)." 
</P>
<P>
However, Pentagon planners admitted that they still fear that such pro-Noriega 
forces as Battalion 2000, which Wednesday fled its base north of Panama City, 
might have retreated into Panama's dense jungles to regroup. 
</P>
<P>
"We carry them as a possible future problem," said Kelly of the force. 
Battalion 2000, which has 500 to 800 men, was established by Noriega in 1983 to 
protect the Panama Canal when, under the terms of the Panama Canal Treaties 
with the United States, the waterway is turned over to Panama in the year 2000. 
The battalion was helpful to Noriega during the October coup attempt against 
him, but Kelly said Thursday that it is not clear whether it remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
Units from the 7th Infantry Division, based in Ft. Ord, Calif., and a brigade 
of more than 300 military police from Ft. Bragg, N.C., arrived in Panama on 
Thursday and joined Army Rangers and paratroopers who already had begun to 
patrol Panama City's streets. The additions brought the total U.S. force to 
22,500. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said that the 16th Military Police Brigade will allow local commanders to 
establish communications that will permit the U.S. forces to perform "some 
police functions in Panama City insofar as rounding people up and disarming 
them are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Infantryman from the 82nd Airborne, riding in high-tech trucks called 
"Hummers," rushed past rooftop snipers at the Marriott Hotel, where 29 American 
and 35 foreign nationals were pinned down, and evacuated the civilians Thursday 
morning. U.S. soldiers combed a second hotel for possible hostages. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Americans salvaged what Kelly described as "a large 
cache" of PDF documents from the burned-out remains of Noriega's headquarters. 
The documents were to be combed by military intelligence analysts and whisked 
to Justice Department officials for use as evidence in the prosecution of 
Noriega on drug-trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other Army Rangers, as well as special operations forces, scoured 
the countryside to bring in Noriega -- a task that Kelly called "one of our top 
priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, in an interview, said that the task of 
mopping up "would be a little easier if Noriega wasn't dashing around the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. Ted Sheafer, the Joint Staff's intelligence chief, said Pentagon 
intelligence analysts believe that Noriega remains in Panama. But he added that 
there have been "innumerable reports" of sightings, including some that place 
him in Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that Noriega might try to flee to Nicaragua or Cuba, U.S. soldiers kept 
well-armed surveillance on those nations' embassies in Panama City, Pentagon 
officials said. They denied reports that the embassies were surrounded by 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for an intensified manhunt, Pentagon officials said that the 
operation's next step would be the deployment of some troops close to Panama's 
northern border with Costa Rica. That section of Panama is a traditional 
stronghold for the deposed dictator. 
</P>
<P>
While many of the PDF's 7,300-man regular force appears to have disappeared 
into Panama's civilian population or into the jungles, American forces by 
Thursday morning had rounded up 1,500 prisoners, Pentagon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They estimated that by Thursday morning, 59 Panamanian soldiers had been killed 
in the fighting and 66 wounded. They said they had no estimates of civilian 
casualties, although Panamanian hospital officials estimated that hundreds of 
civilians were treated for wounds. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday night, 21 U.S. servicemen had died in Panama and 208 were wounded. 
Another four were missing. 
</P>
<P>
As U.S. forces began the task of interrogating prisoners, Noriega's 
brother-in-law, an officer in the PDF, contacted U.S. forces and offered to 
surrender along with 15 fellow soldiers, according to Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. soldiers also faced the delicate task of distinguishing Panamanian 
civilians from straggling Panamanian troops intent on ambush. 
</P>
<P>
Along with night-time parachute operations, which the 82nd Airborne conducted 
early Wednesday morning, urban warfare "is one of the most difficult and 
dangerous forms of maneuver there is," said Lt. Col. Bob Killebrew, a Pentagon 
official who until two months ago commanded the 1st Battalion of the 82nd 
Airborne's 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, now in Panama.

Excerpts from President Bush's news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On Noriega 
</P>
<P>
Q: Mr. President, one of your major objectives was to get Noriega. Are you 
frustrated that he got away? How long will you keep on chasing him? And are you 
confident that you'll get him? 
</P>
<P>
A: I've been frustrated that he's been in power this long -- extraordinarily 
frustrated. The good news: He's out of power. The bad news: He has not yet been 
brought to justice. So I'd have to say . . . there is a certain level of 
frustration on that account. The good news, though, is that the government's 
beginning to function, and the man controls no forces, and he's out. But, yes, 
I won't be satisfied until we see him come to justice. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How long will you keep up your full-scale pursuit? 
</P>
<P>
A: As long as it takes. 
</P>
<P>
On Noriega Bounty 
</P>
<P>
Q: What led you to approve of the decision to have a bounty on Noriega . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
A: His picture will be in every post office in town, that's the way it works. 
He is a fugitive drug dealer and we want to see him brought to justice. And if 
that helps, if there is some incentive for some Panamanian to turn him in, 
that's a very -- a million bucks that I would be very happy to sign the check 
for. 
</P>
<P>
On Casualties 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did you expect (the casualties) to be so high on both sides? And also was it 
really worth it to send people to their death for this? To get Noriega? 
</P>
<P>
A: We had some estimates on the casualties ahead of time, but not in numbers. I 
mean, it was more general -- that, "Look, Mr. President, no way can you do an 
operation this large and not have American casualties." So the Defense 
Department was very up front with us about that. And every human life is 
precious, and yet I have to answer, yes, it has been worth it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What can you tell us about civilian casualties, specifically Panamanian 
civilian casualties down there? 
</P>
<P>
A: Our numbers are almost nonexistent, and I heard some reports from a 
hospital, and we've not been able to confirm those numbers, that some civilians 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
On Use of Force 
</P>
<P>
Q: A few months ago, you said your complaint was not with the PDF (Panama 
Defense Forces), not with the Panamanian people, but with Noriega only. You 
also said . . . that you didn't think it would be prudent to launch a 
large-scale military operation. What changed your mind, and particularly why 
did you opt for the maximum use of force in this situation? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think what changed my mind was the events that I cited in briefing the 
American people on this yesterday: the death of the Marine, the brutalizing, 
really obscene torture of the Navy lieutenant, and the threat of sexual abuse 
and the terror inflicted on that Navy lieutenant's wife, the declaration of war 
by Noriega, the fact that our people down there felt that they didn't know 
where this was going and they weren't sure what all that meant and whether that 
meant we could guarantee the safety of Americans there. And so I made a 
decision to move and to move with enough force -- this was the recommendation 
of the Pentagon -- to be sure that we minimized the loss of life on both sides. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
On the Hostages 
</P>
<P>
Q: Mr. President, what do you know about Americans held against their will, and 
what are you doing now to free them? 
</P>
<P>
A: I'm looking for help on that because we don't have a count. And if there are 
a lot of them, we don't know about it. But, I just had a briefing -- I don't 
know whether Cheney's still here. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Well, the Pentagon said, sir, there were 12 open cases. 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, I'll tell you, that included probably those Smithsonian people who 
have now been released, and I think there may have been 9 or 10 of those. So -- 
but, I'd just have to get Marlin to get back to you. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Well, does that indicate that that's not a priority in the reporting to you 
-- 
</P>
<P>
A: No. It indicates to me that it's very hard to know what's going on when 
there's a fire fight and a battle. . . .

RESISTANCE: MANY CALL THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS COMMON STREET TOUGHS. THEY STILL

They are young, unemployed and violent, prone to prowl the streets looking for 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
After creating them last year, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega touted the Batallon 
Dignidad, or Dignity Battalion, as a youth group of patriotic Panamanians. 
Other observers contend that they are armed thugs embraced by Noriega because 
they, unlike his military forces, can be counted on to kill civilians without 
reservation. Today, they stand as a leading obstacle to U.S. efforts to crush 
the last vestiges of Noriega's power. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year they drew international attention by brutally beating 
opposition candidates in Panama's presidential election campaign. In the most 
infamous incident, the group savagely bloodied vice presidential candidate 
Guillermo (Billy) Ford as foreign television cameras recorded the incident. 
Some of the battalion members who participated wore crimson T-shirts with white 
letters that identified their organization. 
</P>
<P>
Now that U.S. forces have driven Noriega out of office, these loosely organized 
bands of street toughs roam through the city taking hostages and menacing 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"They claim they're defending the dignity of the nation in the face of Yankee 
imperialism," said Richard Millett, a Latin American history professor at 
Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville, Ill. "They are like the Ton Ton 
Macoutes in Haiti. Their purpose (is) to terrorize the domestic political 
opposition." 
</P>
<P>
The Dignity Battalion, in fact, is the most notorious of about two dozen 
similar groups created by Noriega. Total membership in all the groups is 
estimated at 7,000 to 10,000, according to officials. Estimates of Dignity 
Battalion membership range from hundreds to a few thousand. 
</P>
<P>
"They are good at fighting people who are unarmed," said Adm. Ted Sheafer of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "But in fighting uniformed troops, they are not very 
good," he added, referring to their "inadequate" military training. 
</P>
<P>
Millett and other observers said that little is known about these groups 
because they are a relatively new development in Panamanian history. And 
because they operate as Noriega's bodyguards and street enforcers, it is 
difficult to get close. U.S. military officials have said that the paramilitary 
groups are composed mostly of street-smart men from poor and working-class 
neighborhoods, ranging in age from early teens to late 20s. 
</P>
<P>
Millett said he is not optimistic that the U.S. military can find and dissuade 
all of the battalion members from carrying on their activities now that Noriega 
no longer controls the government. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them will melt back into the population," he predicted. "But criminals 
always pose a long-term problem. You can put enough MPs on the streets and they 
won't run rampant. Eventually the MPs will be gone, and they'll still be there. 
It's a problem made worse by high unemployment and class and racial divisions 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is made worse yet by the fact that the Endara government was 
installed by American bayonets," Millett said, referring to newly inaugurated 
President Guillermo Endara. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you expect?" asked Millett. "If you give your political supporters the 
license to beat up anyone they don't like and to extort from them, you'll get a 
lot of volunteers, especially if the economy is going to hell." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega was able to form the Dignity Battalion by "capitalizing on a segment of 
society -- unemployed male youths -- and give them something to do in the name 
of patriotism for Panama," said Jennie Lincoln, a member of former President 
Jimmy Carter's delegation to oversee last May's abortive presidential elections 
in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln said that she doubts that battalion members have any well-conceived 
political philosophy to support their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"It's entertainment for them," she said. "I do not see the Dignity Battalion as 
a patriotic force. I see it as a violent youth gang. The violence was not only 
sanctioned, but promoted, by Manuel Noriega."

WAR ON NARCOTICS:THE MOVE WOULD SIGNAL DISPLEASURE OVER U.S. INVASION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Peru, a key ally in the war on drugs, called Thursday for cancellation of the 
upcoming Andean summit conference on drugs, a signal that Latin America's 
displeasure over the U.S. invasion of Panama has emerged as a serious threat to 
President Bush's anti-narcotics campaign. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. drug fighters officially maintained a stiff upper lip, saying that it is 
too early to speculate about adverse side effects that the U.S. move into 
Panama may have on their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
But officials worried privately that agents of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration stationed abroad now may receive less cooperation and access 
from host countries and that governments like Colombia's might become more 
distant. 
</P>
<P>
American intrusion on Latin nations' sovereignty has been a highly sensitive 
issue as the United States has strived this year to take the anti-drug fight to 
the traffickers and producers in their home regions. 
</P>
<P>
In the Administration's drug strategy, American troops -- this week sent to 
topple Panama's Manuel A. Noriega -- were to play an important role. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Peru, which recalled its ambassador to Washington to underscore its 
protest, Colombia also denounced the U.S. incursion and refused to recognize 
U.S.-supported Guillermo Endara as the new president of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia, the staunchest U.S. ally in the war against violent narcotics 
traffickers, did not immediately endorse the call to cancel the drug summit 
that it is scheduled to host Feb. 15 -- a meeting that President Bush has said 
he plans to attend. 
</P>
<P>
James Hoobler, an official with the State Department's Bureau on International 
Narcotics Matters, said: "We're proceeding on the assumption that the summit is 
going to be held. We have no indication that this (Panama move) will affect the 
war on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, William J. Bennett, director of the White House Office of Drug Control 
Policy, declared that the ouster of Noriega would help the drug campaign 
because Panama "will no longer serve as a haven or vacation spot for drug 
traffickers." 
</P>
<P>
Others were skeptical, however. Never a significant producer or shipping point 
for drugs, Panama's major part in the illicit commerce was in the laundering of 
traffickers' profits, they said. Even with an honest government in power, that 
practice is so ingrained in the Panamanian financial community that it will be 
difficult to curb soon. 
</P>
<P>
Drug policy strategists said they hope a new Panamanian government friendly to 
the United States might pave the way for a U.S.-Panama treaty that would make 
it more difficult for the drug cartels to hide their money in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Such criminal justice agreements, which helped reduce money laundering in 
Switzerland, the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands, can take years to complete, 
and Panama's powerful banking industry could offer serious opposition, one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, who faces drug-trafficking indictments returned last year by federal 
grand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla., is charged with accepting bribes of $10 
million from members of Colombia's Medellin cartel to protect smugglers and 
cocaine shipments and to launder profits and supply drug laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, the protests by Peru and Colombia joined those previously 
made by Bolivia, Ecuador, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Guatemala, Argentina and 
Costa Rica. Only El Salvador, heavily dependent on U.S. support for its battle 
against leftist guerrillas, said the intervention in Panama was "justifiable." 
</P>
<P>
In Bogota, Foreign Minister Julio Londono declared: "No country can assume the 
right to intervene, directly or indirectly, in other state's affairs, whatever 
reasons or purposes it may have, much less militarily." 
</P>
<P>
The Organization of American States, composed of the United States and most of 
the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean, was moving at its session 
Thursday toward condemning the invasion but had not worked out the wording of 
the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Londono said representatives of several Latin nations plan to meet in 
Washington over the weekend to study possible solutions to the crisis. A 
Justice Department source said officials there regard the statements by Latin 
American leaders to be pro forma.

"I don't think anyone here believes there is anything but a positive reaction 
on the drug war from the steps taken in Panama," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Con Dougherty, a spokesman for the DEA, said he could offer "no speculation on 
what might be the effect" of the Panama invasion on such projects as the large 
U.S.-backed anti-drug mission in the Upper Huallaga Valley of Peru. 
</P>
<P>
"The drug summit meeting is still on the schedule," he said. "It's too early to 
speculate about other things." The summit was called to intensify and 
coordinate the multi-pronged assault on traffickers in the Andean nations. 
</P>
<P>
Another Administration official involved in the drug war, while acknowledging 
concerns, remarked that "the honest answer is it's too soon to tell" whether 
the Panama invasion will impede Latin American cooperation.

The Soviet Union said Thursday that American attempts to explain why the United 
States intervened militarily in Panama were little more than a "propaganda 
smoke screen" that could not disguise Washington's gross violation of the norm 
of humane relations between countries. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, reaction to the American military initiative divided along 
ideological lines, with Western allies expressing understanding while East Bloc 
and nonaligned nations generally condemned the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin released a statement calling the U.S. military intervention in 
Panama "a challenge to the international community, which is striving to base 
its relations on principles of respect for the sovereignty and honor of other 
nations." 
</P>
<P>
"It is in flagrant contradiction to the positive tendencies that are today 
gaining ground in world politics, and to dialogue and political diplomatic 
methods of resolving difficult problems . . . (and) a flagrant violation of the 
fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and norms of relations 
among states," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"The American action runs counter to the numerous efforts to achieve a 
political settlement in Central America. The security of Soviet citizens also 
is being endangered in Panama," the government declared. The statement did not 
specify how many Soviet citizens live in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The official Tass news agency, in a separate commentary, said attempts to 
justify American actions in Panama "do not mislead anyone." 
</P>
<P>
"Few people have doubts that the main goal of the action is to revise the 
U.S.-Panama Canal Treaties in order to perpetuate U.S. control over the canal 
and the American military bases on Panamanian territory. 
</P>
<P>
"One can imagine what kind of place the world will become if the ruling of a 
court in one country can give just cause for armed aggression against another 
country," Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Communist Party daily Pravda said: "The propaganda smoke screen cannot 
conceal the nature of this action. The need to protect the lives of American 
citizens and restore democracy in Panama is no more than an attempt to 
camouflage the ominous fact of armed interference." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet media for the last several months have reported that drug allegations 
against Gen. Manuel A. Noriega are unfounded and that the United States has 
targeted Noriega because of his nationalistic views and because of American 
interest in gaining control over the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
Tass also reported Thursday that, during a meeting between U.S. Ambassador Jack 
F. Matlock Jr. and Deputy Soviet Foreign Minister Alexander A. Bessmertnykh 
this week, "the Soviet side resolutely demanded a halt to the intervention . . 
. and demanded that the American armed forces urgently pull out of the 
territory of the sovereign state of Panama." 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, Prime Minister Guilio Andreotti, who met Thursday with the American 
ambassador to Italy, expressed understanding for the U.S. intervention but 
stopped short of giving his complete support. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush's decision on Panama came after a long attempt by the 
Organization of American States to restore legality in the Panamanian republic 
after the disconcerting annulment of elections which the (pro-Noriega) 
government lost," Andreotti said. "The motivation of the struggle against drug 
trafficking adds another element of understanding for the President of the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
Britain was still the only member government of the European Community to have 
given wholehearted public support to the U.S. action. 
</P>
<P>
No other European Community government has come out behind the American 
President's decision. Apart from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's unqualified 
declaration of support, the only other high-level comment on the events in 
Panama came from the Spanish prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, who said in 
Madrid that his government "condemned outright all foreign intervention." 
</P>
<P>
None of the other EC member states has any sympathy for Gen. Noriega nor 
seriously doubts that the results of the general election last May were in 
favor of the Panamanian opposition. But in most EC capitals, there was barely 
disguised embarrassment at the timing of the American military action, which is 
seen as diverting attention from the repression of the Ceausescu regime in 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Boiko Dimitrov said U.S. intervention in Panama 
"awakens associations with gunboat diplomacy, with what happened in the 
Dominican Republic, in Lebanon and on Grenada." 
</P>
<P>
China, angry with Washington because of its condemnation of the bloody 
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in June, condemned the U.S. action and 
urged the United States to "immediately stop the military invasion." 
</P>
<P>
Official Vietnamese Radio said the U.S. attack was motivated by a desire to 
retain control of the canal. Hanoi Radio, monitored in Bangkok, Thailand, also 
said: "The United States falsely accused Noriega of drug trafficking." 
</P>
<P>
India condemned the intervention and called for a swift pullout of U.S. forces. 
The government reaction, read to both houses of Parliament, then triggered a 
walkout in the upper house by the opposition Congress Party, which deemed the 
official response "unsatisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
Iran called the U.S. action a bloody Christmas gift that pleases the Devil and 
said it raises questions about Washington's real intentions. 
</P>
<P>
Accusing Washington of "a blatant breach of all internationally-accepted 
principles," Iran said the United States has never been happy with the treaty 
pledge to delegate authority over the canal to the Panamanian government. 
</P>
<P>
"Washington never hid its reluctance to abide by the accord it, itself, signed 
with Panama," the Iranian news agency said. "President Bush, your 
Administration has presented a bloody gift for the world's Christians. Very 
bloody indeed, that it saddens Christ -- peace be upon him -- and makes Lucifer 
chuckle with joy," said the agency monitored in Nicosia.

SOUTHLAND: SANTIAGO TORRIJOS SAYS HE FEARS FOR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WHO TAKE UP 
ARMS BELIEVING THEY ARE DEFENDING NATION'S HONOR. 
</P>

<P>
Santiago Torrijos, a former Panamanian consul general in Los Angeles, has every 
reason to loathe Gen. Manuel A. Noriega and wish for his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
Torrijos' uncle, Gen. Omar Torrijos, Panama's previous leader, was killed in a 
suspicious airplane crash in July, 1981, four years after he signed the Panama 
Canal Treaties with President Jimmy Carter. Noriega has been suspected of 
plotting Gen. Torrijos' death. 
</P>
<P>
And last Aug. 15, when Torrijos flew to Panama City to visit his ailing father, 
he was taken into custody by secret police who called him an "enemy" of 
Noriega, blindfolded him and placed him in a dungeon without clothing or food 
for three days and nights. 
</P>
<P>
But Torrijos, who was later released, says he can neither applaud nor condemn 
the U.S. military invasion of his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"We regret this military action had to be taken to establish democracy in 
Panama," Torrijos said. "It is regrettable that we have Panamanians and 
American citizens dying in the streets of Panama at this moment." 
</P>
<P>
His mixed emotions symbolize the feelings sweeping many of the estimated 15,000 
Panamanians in the Los Angeles area -- the largest concentration of Panamanians 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Torrijos, who now owns a consulting business in downtown Los Angeles, served as 
consul general here until February, 1988, when Noriega closed the Panamanian 
consulate in Los Angeles after ousting his puppet civilian president, Eric A. 
Delvalle. 
</P>
<P>
As former consul general, Torrijos said, he has been inundated with telephone 
calls from Panamanians living in the Southland. "We have had a lot of telephone 
calls from relatives of people in Panama who want to know what is going on," 
Torrijos said. Most said they were concerned about the bombing and sniper fire 
around residential areas that are close to military installations. 
</P>
<P>
Torrijos said he also fears for patriotic Panamanians who may have taken up 
arms against U.S. soldiers less in defense of Noriega than in the belief that 
"they are fighting to defend the honor of their country." 
</P>
<P>
The local Panamanian community includes 51 people in Van Nuys who are relatives 
of soldiers involved in the unsuccessful coup attempt against Noriega in 
October, Torrijos said. Other relatives of these soldiers -- many of whom were 
executed after the coup was put down -- have moved to Las Vegas and Miami, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The relatives escaped in the aftermath of the coup and were brought to Miami 
with the help of Catholic Charities," Torrijos said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Torrijos said, he was able to contact his father and brother, 
both of whom live in Panama City. "They are all right, thank God," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Torrijos said that when he was detained in Panama last August after he flew 
there to visit his father, he was eventually released with help from Maj. 
Moises Giroldi Vega, the army officer who was summarily shot to death after 
leading the unsuccessful coup against Noriega on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I have done nothing wrong,' " recalled Torrijos. "They said, 'You 
don't support Noriega, and that is enough for us.' " 
</P>
<P>
While there are no plans to reinstate Torrijos as consul general when peaceful 
relations resume between the two countries, he said he supports Guillermo 
Endara, who was elected president of Panama last May in a contest that Noriega 
refused to honor. Guillermo was sworn in as president on Tuesday at a secret 
location in Panama, shortly before the U.S. invasion began. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope and pray this will be a reconstruction government so that we can live 
in peace," Torrijos said.

East German border workers began dismantling the Berlin Wall at the historic 
Brandenburg Gate on Thursday night to make a new crossing point between East 
and West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 10 p.m., a crane began lifting the cylindrical concrete sections 
from the top of the wall and a worker with a pneumatic drill started 
demolishing part of it. 
</P>
<P>
An East German border guard estimated that the work would only take about 90 
minutes as two teams of 10 border guard engineers cut openings to the left and 
right of the massive Brandenburg Gate. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow 
are due to inaugurate the new crossing with the mayors of East and West Berlin 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds cheered on the western side of the wall and some climbed trees to get a 
better view of the work. The scene was brightly lit by the floodlights that 
have illuminated the 12 columned-gate since it was walled off 28 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The crossing point -- two gates for one-way movement in each direction -- will 
be for pedestrians only.

MANDELA AND WHITE FOE OF APARTHEID REUNITED AFTER 28 YEARS

Jailed black leader Nelson R. Mandela held an emotional reunion Thursday with 
an 84-year-old white woman who was his co-defendant in a landmark 
anti-apartheid trial 28 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Joseph, who in the 1960s was one of the first whites banned by the 
government, spent four hours with Mandela in Victor Verster Prison near Cape 
Town. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in very good form, full of jokes, full of laughter," Joseph said 
outside the prison gate. "He looks forward to coming home, but he doesn't know 
when it will be." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph, who is now confined to a wheelchair, described the meeting as a 
"wonderful, friendly, loving visit." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 71, heads the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement. 
He has been imprisoned for more than 27 years and is serving a life sentence 
for plotting to overthrow the white-run government. His release is widely 
expected within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African officials have for the first time allowed Mandela to 
talk by telephone with exiled African National Congress leaders from his prison 
cell. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Nzo, general secretary of the ANC, said Thursday that he spoke to 
Mandela for the first time in 26 years Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I know his voice. When he came on the line, I immediately knew it was Nelson," 
Nzo said. He said he last spoke with Mandela in 1963, when both were in 
Pretoria prison. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Joseph emerged as leading voices of the anti-apartheid movement in 
the 1950s. They were among more than 150 co-defendants at a 1956-61 treason 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
All the accused were acquitted, but the trial made clear the government's 
intention to clamp down on opponents. Mandela went underground shortly after 
the trial to form the ANC's armed wing. He was arrested in 1962 and has been 
imprisoned since. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph resumed her anti-apartheid activities after the trial but was placed 
under police restrictions, including house arrest, for most of the 1960s and 
1970s. Police lifted the restrictions in 1982, when she was 77. A year later, 
she was arrested for singing and giving a clenched-fist, black power salute 
while attending a treason trial. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the African National Congress awarded Joseph its highest award for 
her "outstanding contribution to the struggle to end apartheid and transform 
South Africa into a united, democratic and non-racial country." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph still attends anti-apartheid rallies and is greeted with rousing cheers 
by black audiences. 
</P>
<P>
She said Mandela has agreed to meet government leaders, including President 
Frederik W. de Klerk, because "the time has come for peaceful talks between the 
government and the ANC." 
</P>
<P>
"The ANC can't give up the armed struggle at this stage, but he (Mandela) is 
very hopeful," Joseph said.

Polish officials have rejected an offer by an Italian Communist to buy a statue 
of V. I. Lenin that was removed from a public square after violent anti-Soviet 
demonstrations, it was reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Napoleone, a member of the Italian Communist Party who owns a Rome 
publishing house, offered to give the 30-foot monument "a place worthy of a 
great revolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
But the local government council in Nowa Huta, the industrial suburb built as a 
model socialist city in 1950s, decided that the statue "cannot be the object of 
such a transaction," according to the state news agency PAP.

CZECH COMMUNIST RESHUFFLE RETAINS BASIC PARTY DOCTRINES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The once-dominant Communist Party wound up an emergency congress here Thursday 
with a reshuffled leadership but few fundamental changes in its basic 
doctrines. 
</P>
<P>
Although the party congress adopted a new program that promises to respect 
minority views, the delegates rejected calls to abandon Marxist-Leninist ideas 
or the basic principle of "democratic centralism," which effectively prohibits 
internal dissent once party leaders make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The delegates' main response to the collapse of Communist power here was a 
traditional one: They ordered a purge. The congress expelled one former leader 
and suspended 32 more, including former President Gustav Husak, former Prime 
Minister Lubomir Strougal and virtually the entire top leadership of the last 
20 years. An investigatory commission will be set up to probe financial 
corruption by former leaders and recommend further expulsions, the congress 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Communist parties in neighboring East Germany and Hungary, the 
Czechoslovak Communists rejected suggestions that their party change its name. 
</P>
<P>
The delegates also voted to disband the party-controlled People's Militia. The 
step carried great symbolic significance but few practical consequences because 
the militia had been disarmed and effectively dispersed last month. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the new Czechoslovak government, which is dominated by 
non-Communist ministers, announced that it had agreed with the Vatican on the 
filling of five Catholic bishoprics that have long been vacant here. The 
government would provide the Vatican full leeway to fill positions as the 
church sees fit, Deputy Prime Minister Frantisek Hromadka said after returning 
here from two days of talks in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The government also announced the formal disbanding of the STB, as the secret 
police here are known. Police agents will be reassigned to new posts, with only 
a small force of experts kept as a national force to fight drug trafficking and 
smuggling, a government statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency Communist Party congress had been billed by party leaders as a 
key step toward regaining public trust and setting the party on the path to 
compete in free elections that are expected to be held here in the spring or 
early summer. 
</P>
<P>
But it failed to meet the demands of reformers, and much of the debate seemed 
at times to have little connection with the nation's current realities. 
</P>
<P>
Many delegates "are still under an illusion," complained Jaromir Sedlack, a 
leader in the Democratic Forum, the party's reform wing. "They think we're 
still quite important; they don't realize we're a minority, that the real power 
is elsewhere now." 
</P>
<P>
The congress avoided an outright split in the party, providing Sedlack and his 
fellow reformers enough party positions to keep them within the ranks. But its 
actions provided little evidence that the Communists will be able to stave off 
devastation at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Both mainstream and reform delegates conceded that the party would receive far 
less support than the roughly one-third of the vote that its candidates won in 
the nation's last free election, in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
"I think 10-12% maximum," said Iva Strackova, an economist and party reform 
leader in one typical response. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the best measure of the party's loss of clout came when workers at the 
giant Palace of Culture, where the congress was held, announced that its 
deliberations would have to end because they refuse to work overtime. In the 
party's heyday -- only a month ago -- such disrespect would have been 
unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the unthinkable has become commonplace here. Party leaders are 
discovering that most of their office buildings, including the ones that houses 
the party Central Committee, actually belong to the state, not the party, and 
that they are being evicted. Party officials have lost their bodyguards, 
special food stores and chauffeured limousines. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the party announced that it is asking its department heads to take 
a pay cut because of falling revenue. The current central staff of more than 
9,000 people will have to be cut at least in half over the next few months, 
party spokesman Josef Hora said. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists once claimed 1.7 million dues-paying members here, a number 
swollen by the need to belong to the party to obtain the most desirable jobs. 
Now, the ranks are shrinking too fast for party leaders to count. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what the actual number of dues-paying members is now, one party official 
replied, simply, "God knows."

BITTER COLD SNAP TO EASE IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS

<P>
The Arctic onslaught of record low temperatures that has plagued much of the 
nation for 10 days sent another thrust across the border Thursday, closing 
hundreds of schools from Montana to the Eastern Seaboard and threatening Texas' 
citrus crop. 
</P>
<P>
But the double wallop of frigid temperatures and high polar winds blamed for 
more than 40 deaths nationwide was expected to slacken after today, promising a 
Christmas with more seasonable temperatures, forecasters said.

"We're going to moderate right into Christmas," said National Weather Service 
forecaster Steve Kahn in Chicago. "Temperatures have stopped falling -- they 
are going to rebound a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
That was small comfort across the Midwest and West, where wind chills Thursday 
-- the day that winter officially began -- dipped to as low as 83 below in 
North Dakota and more than 70 below in Minnesota and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
In Havre, Mont., an overnight low of 43 below broke a record for the day set in 
1884. Chicago set a record with a 13 below reading, colder than in 1872, when 
the previous record of 12 below zero was set. 
</P>
<P>
Record lows recorded Thursday also included 20 below zero in Omaha; 19 below in 
Dubuque, Iowa; 17 below in Des Moines, Iowa, and 7 below in Topeka, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Weather officials warned that the subzero temperatures, combined with stinging 
wind, could cause frostbite in a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just about as bad as it can get in Iowa," said weather service 
forecaster Scott Truett in Des Moines. "Especially this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
It was so cold in Minnesota that Northern States Power Co. took the 
unprecedented step of asking customers to curtail their use of electricity by 
taking such measures as turning off their Christmas lights. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area ranged to 30 below zero 
without the wind-chill factor and 80 below with it. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago police opened station doors to the homeless who were seeking shelter 
while waiting for vans to take them to city-operated warming centers. At least 
10 people have died of exposure in the Chicago area since the cold snap began, 
a spokeswoman for the Cook County medical examiner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the deaths elsewhere were two elderly Pittsburgh-area women whose space 
heaters, their only source of heat, were not enough to withstand the cold, 
officials said. "Basically it means they froze to death," Deputy Coroner James 
Gregris said. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-morning Thursday, hundreds of schools had been closed in Iowa, 
Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and New York state. Some school officials 
said they did not want young children waiting for buses or walking to school. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it might be dangerous," said Jean Kennedy, a spokeswoman for a 
school district in the St. Louis area. 
</P>
<P>
Business was good at towing companies and auto parts stores, as customers 
sought out batteries, thermostats and engine heaters. Tammy Collett of Council 
Bluffs, Iowa, said she called 10 towing firms for assistance, but only one 
would send a truck. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they were too busy or they wouldn't come out, and they were all 
24-hour towing companies," she said. "It was not very pleasant, that's for 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
In Minot, N.D., Amtrak's Empire Builder passenger train came to a halt as fuel 
froze in its engine, stranding about 300 passengers in area motels overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Texas forecasters feared a worse cold snap than the December, 1983, freeze that 
virtually wiped out the Rio Grande Valley's citrus crop, killing hundreds of 
thousands of orange and grapefruit trees. Temperatures were expected to drop 
into the lower 20s today and Saturday.

Photo, Winter Welcome?The Arctic onslaught of record low temperatures -- which 
has plagued much of the nation for 10 days -- sent another thrust across the 
border. On the day that winter officially began, wind chills dipped to as low 
as 83 below in North Dakota and 70 below in Minnesota and Nebraska. Chicago set 
a record with a 13-below reading, colder than in 1872, when the previous record 
of 12-below zero was set. Fighting a multi-alarm fire in Chicago was

Prison administrators showed "serious misjudgments" in failing to heed warnings 
of inmate unrest at Camp Hill state prison, and in not securing the institution 
after the first of two nights of rioting, a report released Thursday concluded. 
</P>
<P>
But Arlin Adams, a retired judge who headed the three-member investigating 
panel that issued the report, stopped short of recommending to Gov. Robert P. 
Casey that anyone be fired because of the October riots that destroyed half of 
the medium-security facility. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-page report documents in detail how inmates indicated their plans for an 
uprising, and how administrators failed to appreciate the severity of the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
It said corrections officials made critical mistakes after the first night of 
rioting by failing to conduct a shakedown of the inmates and failing to padlock 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
Casey said he would act on the recommendations after discussing the report with 
Corrections Commissioner David Owens. 
</P>
<P>
The prison near Harrisburg suffered $15 million in damage during rioting in 
late October. At least 122 people were injured and 26 guards were taken 
hostage.

HEALTH CARE REFUNDS WILL BEGIN IN FEBRUARY; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICARE: BENEFICIARIES PAYING FOR THE REPEALED CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE WILL GET 
CHECKS TOTALING $21.20. A COMPUTER PROGRAM IS STILL DEDUCTING PREMIUMS.

The federal government will begin sending refunds in February to millions of 
Medicare beneficiaries who continue paying premiums for the repealed 
catastrophic care law, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury will make two payments of $10.60, in February and again in April, 
for each Medicare enrollee, the Treasury and Social Security Administration 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
The total refund of $21.20 will compensate for the $5.30 a month premium that 
will be deducted from Social Security checks each month from January through 
April. Although the catastrophic care benefits end as of Jan. 1, Social 
Security computers will continue making the premium deductions through April 
because it takes months to rewrite instructions for such a massive computer 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Security Administration first indicated that its computers could not 
be corrected to stop the deductions until May or later. Officials originally 
promised that a lump sum refund payment would be issued in the summer by the 
Treasury, which prints and mails checks for government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But Social Security officials then consulted with outside experts and proposed 
that refund checks be sent beginning in February. A dispute developed with 
Treasury, which claimed that it would be difficult and costly to issue 28 
million refund checks in addition to the normal monthly mailings. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies settled their conflict Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's announcement is great news for America's elderly, many of whom live on 
fixed incomes," said Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn S. King. "We are 
working diligently to expedite the computer changes required to properly adjust 
Social Security checks but we must be extremely careful not to destroy a 
carefully constructed system of payments (providing) $19 billion a month," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that the agency must alter "more than 150 different computer software 
programs" to eliminate the $5.30 a month deduction. 
</P>
<P>
The refunds will total an estimated $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to assist (the Social Security Administration) in expeditiously 
refunding these payments to senior citizens," said Treasury official W. E. 
Douglas. The procedure "will provide the most timely service to recipients 
without jeopardizing" the 250 million other payments disbursed by Treasury "at 
this peak time of the year," Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
The service he heads handles Social Security payments, tax refunds, federal 
salaries, veterans benefits and other government payments. 
</P>
<P>
The repealed catastrophic care law, passed by Congress enthusiastically in 
1988, was repudiated with equally intense fervor 17 months later. It provided 
expanded hospital care, a ceiling on payments for doctor bills and coverage of 
prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But its financing mechanism -- the monthly premium and a surtax on those over 
65 who pay federal income taxes -- proved politically fatal. The surtax, which 
would have touched about 40% of those over 65, was resented as an unfair levy 
on a narrow segment of the population. Complaints from angry Medicare 
beneficiaries, many of whom already had supplemental health insurance, forced 
an abrupt turnaround in Congress. It voted in November to scrap the entire 
catastrophic care program.

NEW THREATS MADE TO 2 BOMB TARGETS MAY AID PROBE; 
</P>
<P>
TERRORISM: THE RECIPIENTS ARE NOT NAMED. AUTHORITIES ADMIT THAT THE LETTERS 
COULD BE A HOAX.

<P>
ATLANTA -- Federal officials, citing progress in their investigation of four 
mail bombings and attempted bombings in the South, said Thursday that 
"follow-up" threats mailed to two of the four targets may point the way to 
suspects in the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
There is a strong possibility that the new letters, mailed this week, were sent 
by the same person or group responsible for sending the powerful package bombs 
that killed a federal judge Saturday and a lawyer two days later, the officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been follow-up letters sent since the receipt of the bomb parcels," 
Leo F. Shatzel, special agent in charge of postal inspectors, told a news 
conference here. "It appears that these letters may have been sent by 
individuals who mailed the parcels." 
</P>
<P>
William L. Hinshaw, the agent in charge of the Atlanta FBI office, said: 
"There's a great deal of interest in those letters." He said there is "a very 
good possibility" that the letters were written to claim responsibility for the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
The federal investigators did not disclose what threats were contained in the 
letters or to which targets they were sent. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the bombs that killed Robert S. Vance, a judge of the U.S. 11th 
Circuit Court of Appeals, at his home in Mountain Brook, Ala., and Alderman 
Robert Robinson of Savannah, Ga., a bomb was defused at the 11th Circuit Court 
building here on Monday. A day later, another bomb was safely defused in the 
Jacksonville, Fla., office of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that their strongest suspects continue to be white supremacists 
and that civil rights organizations and the judiciary remain the most likely 
targets of possible new violence. 
</P>
<P>
Rights groups have been increasingly vigilant since the bombings, and federal 
postal inspectors are screening packages addressed to the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
Although Vance was only the third federal judge to be assassinated in this 
century, civil rights officials said that they will hold a news conference 
today to outline previous attempts by hate groups to kill judges. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have recovered two bombs, which they say are similar to those 
that exploded -- pipe explosives surrounded by nails. However, they have 
emphasized the threatening letters more than any evidence they may have 
gathered from their examination of the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
The new letters contain language similar to a series of letters mailed last 
August to media organizations and various circuit courts around the nation, 
according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier letters cited what the writers contended were unfair court rulings 
and threatened to make massive poison gas attacks in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of these letters, headlined "Declaration of War," was postmarked 
from Atlanta on the same day that a tear-gas bomb exploded at the Atlanta NAACP 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are trying to find links between the August letters and those 
sent this week. Although they are enthusiastically pursuing this angle, they 
admit that the letters could be a hoax, sent by someone who learned about the 
crimes from news reports. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the investigators continue to leave open any possibility, including 
the one that Colombian drug dealers may be behind the bombings, although that 
one has faded far into the background. 
</P>
<P>
Hinshaw said: "We've got a few pieces of a puzzle, and we don't know where they 
fit." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to enlist the public in the effort to solve the bombings, 
officials Thursday announced telephone "tip lines." In Birmingham, the number 
is (205) 252-2416. The number in Atlanta is (404) 361-1092. 
</P>
<P>
All information provided through these numbers will be kept confidential, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators, including agents from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms, the U.S. Marshals Service, the postal service and local 
law enforcement agencies, are seeking common threads that connect the targets 
of the bombings to bomb threats. 
</P>
<P>
So far, school desegregation suits brought by the NAACP seem the strongest 
connection: Robinson, an attorney, represented the NAACP in a suit in Savannah; 
the Jacksonville NAACP won a suit; and Judge Vance reinstated busing there, 
ruling last September. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the state of Georgia has emerged as the chief geographical focus because 
all four bombs and an unspecified number of the letters were mailed from 
Georgia towns. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's safe to say there are more investigations being conducted in 
Georgia than anywhere else," Hinshaw said, because "we have more leads in 
Georgia. Just more things are going on."

MIT RESEARCHERS IDENTIFY 'MASTER BUILDER' GENE; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENCE: THE GENE CONTROLS THE BODY'S DISEASE-FIGHTING PROCESS. THE DISCOVERY 
HAS NO IMMEDIATE MEDICAL APPLICATION, BUT COULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
DRUGS THAT WOULD FINE-TUNE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Molecular biologists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology report that 
they have isolated and identified the "master builder" gene that controls the 
disease-fighting process, marshaling its forces like a general preparing to 
repel an enemy invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery, reported in today's Cell journal, should provide fundamental new 
insights into how the immune system functions, according to pathologist Michael 
Lieber of Stanford University. "I would think it would be one of the top 10 . . 
. discoveries in immunology," Lieber said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a remarkable technical achievement, an extremely elegant piece of 
science," added molecular immunologist Frederick Alt of Columbia University in 
New York City. "We now have in hand the tools to dissect the system that is 
involved in the assembly of antibody genes. We'll make a tremendous amount of 
progress in the next year." 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of how this process is controlled has no immediate medical 
application, but the finding could eventually lead to the development of drugs 
that would fine-tune the immune system. Even further off, it might lead to ways 
to repair the ravages of the immune system caused by the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Over a lifetime, a human encounters literally tens of thousands of different 
infectious bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Most of the time, these 
encounters are benign because humans have evolved a remarkable immune mechanism 
that, at any given time, posts more than 100,000 unique sentries to identify 
the invaders and sound the warning call for their destruction. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the body's genetic repertoire does not have a set of genes that 
serve as blueprints for each of these sentries, called B cells. Instead, it has 
a small library of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) fragments that are constantly 
being chopped up, shuffled and recombined to produce millions of different B 
cells over the course of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Defects in the gene may be responsible for some of the genetic diseases that 
produce a non-functioning immune system, such as that suffered by David, the 
"bubble boy" in Houston who spent all of his short life in a plastic-enclosed, 
sterile environment. 
</P>
<P>
Defects might also lead to the formation of tumors of the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Some biologists believe that a similar shuffling and recombining process may 
play a role in the differentiation of unspecialized cells in the early embryo 
into specialized cells in various organs, particularly in the brain and nervous 
and sensory systems. The gene that has been identified could be used as a probe 
to locate such genes in other systems. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists have long puzzled over the riddle of how the body could generate the 
large number of individual antibody-secreting cells that are known to exist in 
the immune system. Immunologist Susumu Tonegawa of Japan solved that in the 
early 1980s by demonstrating that a small genetic library could be constantly 
reshuffled and recombined to produce the necessary number of antibodies -- a 
feat for which he won the 1989 Nobel Prize for Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"Since then, we have learned surprisingly little" about how the body achieves 
this rearrangement, said molecular biologist David Baltimore of MIT's Whitehead 
Institute for Biomedical Research, the leader of the team that isolated the 
gene. "This is the first step toward finding a chemical basis of diversity." 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore and two graduate students, David G. Schatz and Marjorie A. Oettinger, 
isolated the gene from human white blood cells. They were able to prove the 
gene's function by inserting it into cultured skin cells, which -- like all 
cells in the body other than immune cells -- cannot normally carry out the 
shuffling and recombination process. 
</P>
<P>
After the gene was inserted, the skin cells were able to do so, Oettinger said 
in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers still do not know precisely how the gene functions, however. In 
fact, there are two possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
One is that the gene codes for an enzyme called recombinase. That enzyme, 
Lieber said, is a "molecular surgeon" that actually carries out the cutting and 
recombining process. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, the gene could operate at the genetic level, orchestrating the 
entire recombination process by turning on and off the genes for recombinase 
and other components of the system. 
</P>
<P>
For a variety of reasons, the MIT group believes that the gene is the blueprint 
for the recombinase, Oettinger said. But either way, she said, "It is going to 
teach us a lot more about the basic science of the immune system."

MEDICINE SHOCK THERAPY; 
</P>
<P>
PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION ISSUES GUIDELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The country's largest professional group of psychiatrists announced elaborate 
guidelines Thursday for the use of electroshock therapy, the controversial 
treatment for severe depression that is experiencing a resurgence in medical 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines drawn up by the American Psychiatric Assn. were described as 
among the most detailed ever issued to explain how a therapy should be used -- 
testament to rapid advances in the science of shock therapy and to public 
pressure for accountability. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no intent to increase or decrease . . . use (of electroshock)," Dr. 
Richard Weiner, an author of the report, said. "The intent is to maximize the 
efficacy and safety with which it is provided, to make sure it's used in the 
proper fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Electroshock therapy, also known as electroconvulsive therapy or ECT, uses an 
electric shock to induce a seizure as a form of psychiatric treatment. By 
changing the balance of chemicals in the brain, it is used to treat severe 
depressive illness and mania, usually after drug therapy has failed. 
</P>
<P>
Discovered in the late 1930s, shock therapy was used and abused widely in the 
1940s and 1950s. Some patients received dozens of treatments. Its excesses 
became a subject of Sylvia Plath's novel, "The Bell Jar," and Ken Kesey's "One 
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." 
</P>
<P>
With the discovery of effective antidepressant drugs in the early 1960s, use of 
electroconvulsive therapy dwindled. After several decades of quiescence, 
interest was rekindled in the 1980s as a result of research that showed how the 
therapy could be better used. 
</P>
<P>
"ECT's effectiveness in rescuing severely ill patients from the despairing 
depths of depression or the perilous heights of uncontrolled mania is well 
accepted by psychiatrists," Dr. Herbert Pardes, president of the APA, said at a 
news conference Thursday. "However, ECT, like treatments for every other 
illness, is not 100% effective, it is not a cure and it does have some adverse 
effects," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The APA guidelines -- filling more than 200 pages and scheduled for publication 
in book form -- cover, among many other things, situations in which ECT may be 
appropriate or inappropriate and precisely how it should be used. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also explore the issue of patient consent, an especially 
contentious issue in the case of shock therapy. They emphasize the importance 
of informed consent from all patients capable of giving it and the fact that 
consent may be revoked at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give the patient the benefit of the doubt, concerning their right 
to agree or disagree," said Weiner, chairman of the APA's task force on ECT. He 
said the physician "should express how they feel about it, but it's up to the 
patient to decide." 
</P>
<P>
The report recommends that the primary uses of ECT should be against major 
depression, mania and some cases of schizophrenia and psychosis. It also might 
be used in some medical disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
The typical course of ECT is six to 12 treatments, administered two to three 
times a week. The patient receives a mild current that, specialists believe, 
causes alterations in the brain's chemistry not dissimilar to those caused by 
drugs that treat depression. 
</P>
<P>
The APA, which counts its membership at 36,000, spent two years preparing its 
ECT study. Weiner's task force sought input from numerous medical professional 
groups, regulators, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and lay mental health 
groups.

TENANTS TO SPEND YULE IN SEARCH FOR HOUSING AFTER EVICTION BY FILM STUDIO

A few weeks ago, life seemed pretty normal at the Valentino Place Apartments in 
Hollywood where, legend has it, the famed actor Rudolph Valentino once lived 
and ghosts of old performers now walk the halls at night. 
</P>
<P>
The tenants put a red ribbon around the lion sculpture in the courtyard, as 
they do every year, and hung Christmas decorations in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
But the festive holiday atmosphere at 716 Valentino Place was shattered by an 
eviction notice that arrived early in December, telling tenants the property 
had been sold to a real estate subsidiary of Paramount Pictures Corp. and they 
had a month to move. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing has come as quite a shock to all of us," Kelly McLeod, a young 
woman who has lived there 10 years, said Thursday, as she stood with other 
tenants in the courtyard filled with huge palms, banana trees and monkey ferns. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Studios, located across the street, will be converting the 
Tudor-style, 1920s-era building into office space, removing its 40 units from 
the Los Angeles rental market, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The evictions are perfectly legal, according to Barbara Zeidman, head of the 
city's Rent Stabilization Division. 
</P>
<P>
But she added that, according to city law, owners who remove their units from 
rental rolls have to pay $2,000 in relocation assistance to single-adult 
tenants and $5,000 to elderly or disabled tenants. 
</P>
<P>
But relocation money does not take away the shock and pain of having to leave 
longstanding friendships, find new homes during the Christmas season and face 
rents about double what they are paying now, the tenants said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling of community here," said McLeod, who manages a shop on 
Melrose Avenue that features rubber stamps, "because most of us have been here 
for years." 
</P>
<P>
While once Clara Bow and Marilyn Monroe were among the earlier residents, 
tenants now include performers, many studio employees, artists and retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanna Kim, a frail, elderly woman tottering on high heeled shoes, said she 
had been a "professional dancer, you know," and had lived there for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very sad," she said, her voice fading away. "I love this place." 
</P>
<P>
About 30 tenants staged an orderly candlelight protest outside Paramount on 
Thursday evening to let studio officials know they had "Scrooged" their 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
After years of living in a rent-controlled building, many said they were 
shocked at the higher rents they encountered in looking for new homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've probably looked at 30 apartments," said Michael Hickey, an artist who 
pays $360 a month for a single at Valentino Place. "And the market out there is 
double what I'm paying." 
</P>
<P>
The closure brings to 259 the number of apartment buildings in Los Angeles that 
have been removed from the rental market or demolished so far this year, 
Zeidman said. While she described the 1,114 apartments in those buildings as a 
"modest" number, compared to more than 670,000 units citywide, the figure is 
"disturbing" because about two-thirds of them had rents under $500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the Valentino Place apartments have rents under $500 a month as 
well, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
"What is disturbing is that yes, we're going to replace those 1,114 units with 
new construction, but not at those rent levels," Zeidman said. "We're losing a 
particular type of housing and not replacing it." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Gross, director of the tenants' rights group, Coalition for Economic 
Survival, which has been trying to help the Valentino Place tenants, said the 
city should step in and try to preserve the building as an apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be some attempt to stop affordable housing from being taken off 
the market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Rosen, Paramount senior vice president for corporate communications, 
said the building was needed for offices because "we don't have enough space." 
</P>
<P>
"The tenants have known of our purchase since the end of November," she said, 
adding that "a relocation specialist has been hired to make sure each tenant 
finds an affordable place to live, no matter how long it takes." 
</P>
<P>
William T. Baird, general partner of Valentino Place Ltd., said he liked the 
building and the tenants and did not want to sell it. But the $2.5-million 
purchase price was too good to pass up, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
"It's heart-wrenching," he said. "But it's strictly a business deal."

BRADLEY DONATIONS APPARENTLY VIOLATED LAW; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN FINANCING: MAYOR SAYS HE RELIED ON STAFF TO DECIDE HOW CARNIVAL 
CONTRIBUTIONS SHOULD BE REPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley received tens of thousands of dollars from a series of 
carnival fund-raisers in apparent violation of city campaign limits on small, 
anonymous donations, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's campaign accountant has said that Bradley instructed him to list 
the carnival proceeds as anonymous donations of $100 or less. But a 1985 city 
campaign reform law sets a $200 limit on such anonymous donations in each 
campaign, according to the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The law also requires that anonymous donations that surpass the $200 threshold 
be turned over to the city treasury by the candidate. This was not done by the 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the provision is to ensure that elected officials do not receive 
secret, untraceable contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley campaign officials have yet to say how much money was generated by the 
carnivals. The Times has obtained copies of money orders totaling $20,000 and 
made payable to Bradley's reelection campaign from one of two carnival 
companies that were used. But the figure probably represents only a small 
portion of the money raised by at least 11 inner-city carnivals. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's campaign disclosure statements suggest that the carnivals had become 
a major source of money for his campaign at a time when the mayor was gearing 
up for a reelection race against City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
The documents show that Bradley's campaign received $164,000 in donations of 
under $100 during 1987 and 1988 while the carnivals were being held -- an 
unusually high figure for such contributions, according to campaign experts. 
Public records do not show how much of the money was donated anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
After Yaroslavsky abandoned his mayoral bid and the carnivals ended, the 
mayor's contributions of under $100 dropped dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
During the last half of 1987 and 1988, the mayor's campaign raised about $2.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, the mayor said Thursday that he asked his staff to 
"get to the bottom of this matter" and added, "I will take whatever steps are 
necessary to correct any mistakes, if any were made. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I cannot personally supervise the work of each of the personnel 
working for my campaigns," Bradley said. "Yet I have always held my campaign 
fund-raisers to the highest standards. 
</P>
<P>
"I relied on the campaign attorneys and accountants to decide how the carnival 
contributions should be reported." 
</P>
<P>
The carnivals were coordinated by Westside public relations consultant Mary 
Anne Singer and arranged by her one-time client, Long Beach businessman Allen 
Alevy. 
</P>
<P>
Singer, a contact lens technician, is a personal friend of the mayor who has 
received favors from Bradley for herself and the clients of her small public 
relations business. During the period of the carnivals, Bradley was intervening 
with city officials to help Alevy purchase two parcels of surplus city land. At 
least two of the carnivals were held on the property while it was owned by the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Anthony Alperin said he could not comment on the specifics 
of the Bradley carnivals until a pending city clerk's audit of Bradley's 1989 
campaign contributions is completed. But he confirmed that the City Charter 
prohibits anonymous contributions totaling more than $200. 
</P>
<P>
"You add all anonymous contributions from all sources and you can accept no 
more than $200 in a single election," he said. "Any other (anonymous donations) 
you get you turn over to the city." 
</P>
<P>
Violations of the law, Alperin said, can lead to misdemeanor charges and civil 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
The carnival contributions were listed on official forms under a section that 
does not require donors to be named. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Yaroslavsky and Michael Woo, citing the large carnival 
contributions to the Bradley campaign, said Thursday that they will push for 
changes in the law that will require all contributors to be named, no matter 
how small their donations. 
</P>
<P>
"If candidates and elected officials think they can get around the law by 
running carnivals, then it will fundamentally undermine the City Charter's 
requirements on campaign contribution limitations," Yaroslavsky said. "I think 
it raises a question as to whether these contributions were made to circumvent 
city and state law." 
</P>
<P>
Woo, head of the city's Ad Hoc Ethics Committee, said the amount of money that 
Bradley listed as contributions of under $100 was "strikingly large." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, generally speaking, unreported donations are a bad idea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said events like the carnivals need to be clearly advertised as political 
fund-raisers. He also said the city may need a tougher policy against use of 
city land for political purposes, as the Bradley campaign did with at least two 
carnivals. 
</P>
<P>
City Council President John Ferraro endorsed Woo's suggestions and said that he 
will ask for a city staff report on how and why the campaign events were 
allowed to be held on city land. 
</P>
<P>
"Was there rent paid?" Ferraro said. 
</P>
<P>
If not and they had no approvals, "then they were trespassing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly worth looking looking into," Ferraro added. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley campaign had no permission to hold the carnivals on city land, 
according to city officials in several departments. 
</P>
<P>
The reporting methods used to account for the carnival money appear to place 
Bradley officials in a difficult spot. 
</P>
<P>
If the carnivals were advertised as political fund-raisers, as Bradley's office 
maintains, then the large anonymous donations would appear to violate the 
city's 1985 campaign reform law, which Bradley supported. 
</P>
<P>
If the carnivals were not advertised, as carnival officials have said, then the 
accounting of the carnival money was improper under state and local law. Under 
that scenario, the money would have to be reported as donations from the 
carnival operators or the landowners. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer familiar with the city's campaign finance law said the Bradley 
campaign appears to have problems with the carnival contributions, no matter 
what. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't have it both ways," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Goldenberg, a supervising attorney in the city attorney's office who 
enforces campaign laws, said he recalled only a few cases in which city 
auditors found that the $200 anonymous donation limit had been exceeded. He 
said it involved minor candidates who were unfamiliar with the law. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't even realize what they're doing violates the law. Either they have 
gone back . . . come up with (donors' names), or they have refunded money," 
Goldenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office said there will be no decision on whether to take 
action against the Bradley carnivals until the city clerk's audit is completed.

LAPD COMES UP EMPTY IN GUN-THEFT PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An internal Los Angeles Police Department probe into the alleged theft of gun 
parts by bomb squad officers has found "insufficient evidence to clearly 
establish culpability" among any of the accused policemen. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the investigation identified several "procedural weaknesses and 
administrative concerns" that have been forwarded to Police Chief Daryl F. 
Gates for review, said Robert L. Talcott, president of the Los Angeles Police 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the officers' right to privacy, neither Talcott nor a spokesman for 
Gates would elaborate on what the investigation uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
The Times filed a request under the California Public Records Act to obtain a 
copy of the final report on the department's investigation, which Talcott 
deemed "exhaustive." That request was rejected by the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office on grounds that the investigation was a personnel matter and, 
as such, not public. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Jimmie J. Finn, 46, who raised the allegations of theft and other 
improprieties, said this week he also was denied a copy of the report. 
</P>
<P>
Finn said Thursday he believes he has "suffered that special harm reserved for 
whistle-blowers" by having sparked the investigation -- assignment to LAPD's 
Planning and Research Division. The division generally is considered a 
backwater. 
</P>
<P>
Finn also speculated that the department is "trying to hide something." 
</P>
<P>
A 24-year police veteran and former SWAT team member who holds the department's 
Medal of Valor, Finn in 1986 was given command of the department's firearms and 
explosives section. Finn took over the unit, commonly called the bomb squad, 
five months after two of its most senior members, Detective Arleigh McCree and 
Officer Ron Ball, died while attempting to dismantle a pipe bomb in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Finn alleged that soon after arriving, he discovered evidence indicating that a 
handful of officers in the unit stripped hundreds, perhaps thousands, of 
confiscated guns destined for destruction and were using the parts privately or 
selling them. Finn also alleged that thousands of rounds of confiscated 
ammunition were missing from department evidence lockers. 
</P>
<P>
He said he tried repeatedly to alert his supervisors to what he had found, but 
his superiors appeared reluctant to act. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1988, he went outside the chain of command and met privately with 
members of the Police Commission, the civilian board that oversees department 
operations. An Internal Affairs investigation was launched early this year, 
records show, but it languished until June, when The Times reported Finn's 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in a one-page letter dated Dec. 4, Talcott advised Finn the 
investigation was complete. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of the nearly 2 1/2 years that have elapsed since the events under 
investigation occurred or were raised, the department was faced with the almost 
insurmountable task of retroactively seeking out the truth in a very serious 
and complex case," Talcott wrote. "The unfortunate end result was that the 
statutes of limitations had run (out), memories had failed, and the possibility 
of establishing culpability was almost non-existent. " 
</P>
<P>
"The exhaustive investigation, which involved over 800 hours of research, did, 
however, identify a number of administrative concerns and procedural weaknesses 
which have been brought to the attention of (Gates) for appropriate action." 
</P>
<P>
Talcott commended Finn for pursuing the matter and expressed hope "that the 
experiences gained as a result of this series of incidents will become a part 
of the department's continuing growth process." 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. William Booth, Gates' spokesman, said Thursday that no officers would be 
disciplined as a result of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Finn, meanwhile, said he was not appeased by Talcott's letter or the outcome of 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"I can guarantee you that many members of this department who become aware of 
how I have been treated will be reluctant to step forward to divulge internal 
corruption to the chief of police or the Police Commission," Finn said. "That 
reluctance to fight corruption will ultimately endanger the future of this 
department and its service to the public."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : MANAGER SAYS MURPHY DISLIKED BUCHWALD 
STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Murphy's manager testified Thursday the comedian never liked a story sold 
to Paramount Pictures by humorist Art Buchwald, who is suing the studio for 
allegedly stealing his idea to make Murphy's "Coming to America" hit. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wachs, testifying at the Superior Court trial of Buchwald's $5-million 
breach-of-contract lawsuit, also said he shared Murphy's opinion of Buchwald's 
story, entitled "King for a Day." Wachs testified: "We never liked it from the 
beginning. I told Paramount innumerable times that we didn't like it. It became 
a joke." 
</P>
<P>
Buchwald's lawsuit claims "Coming to America" was based on "King for a Day," a 
story concept he sold to the studio in 1983. "Coming to America" is about an 
African prince who comes to New York to find a bride. Buchwald's concept 
focused on a king from an oil-rich African nation who is stranded in Washington 
when he is overthrown.

CALL FOR OFF-SEASON EMERGENCY PHONES ANSWERED AT THREE POPULAR BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About seven years ago, a man jumped into the ocean with his clothes and cowboy 
boots on to rescue two young girls who were being swept out to sea on their 
body boards by a riptide. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids were washed back in with the surf, but the young man drowned," 
recalled Denny Stoufer, lifeguard supervisor at Carlsbad State Beach, where the 
accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
It was during the off-season, in autumn, and lifeguard service had been reduced 
to patrols of the 13-mile stretch, Stoufer said. "If we had been there, it 
would have been a fairly routine rescue, but we were unlucky that time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario might have turned out differently if the call box unveiled 
Thursday near the drowning site had been there. Bystanders could have called 
for help on the free emergency telephone, Stoufer said. 
</P>
<P>
Installed near the popular jetty near North Cannon Road, south of Tamarack 
Avenue, the call box was one of three switched on Thursday for a 90-day trial 
period, said David Johnson, a spokesman for the San Diego County Department of 
Public Works. Each will service an area frequented by swimmers and surfers -- 
where accidents are most likely to occur. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Carlsbad, the call boxes are at Oceanside Beach, across from the Coast 
Guard station and launching ramp, and at Ocean Beach, about half a mile south 
of the Ocean Beach Pier on Sunset Cliffs Boulevard, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
It was because of an accident similar to the Carlsbad drowning that La Mesa 
Councilman Ed Senechal proposed the call boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was reading in the newspaper about a year ago that two scuba divers had 
drowned off one of our beaches, and one of the reasons was we couldn't get 
someone down there in time," Senechal said. "If we had had a call box on the 
beach, it might have been a lifesaving thing." The accident "stuck in my mind," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Senechal said he proposed the idea of beach call boxes to the San Diego Service 
Authority for Freeway Emergencies. The countywide agency has installed more 
than 1,000 call boxes along freeways throughout San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Funds for the solar-powered cellular phones come from the state Department of 
Motor Vehicles and may be used only for freeway call boxes, said Senechal, who 
represents La Mesa on the authority. But the agency acted as a resource and 
coordinated the beach installations with GTE Cellular Communications Corp., 
which donated the call boxes. Each cost $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
If the trial period proves successful, cities with beach property will have to 
come up with a plan to fund the boxes and dispatch services, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, the Carlsbad and Oceanside call boxes will be linked to 
police. The Sunset Cliffs emergency line will be linked to the San Diego 
Lifeguards Emergency Dispatch, which operates 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Stoufer said he hopes both the City of Carlsbad and the state will fund the 
project after the trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of budgetary restraints, lifeguards can't always be there at the 
beach," he said. In summer, lifeguards are on duty from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The 
call box could be used after-hours and in winter.

BILL BOYARSKY: DEANE DANA: THE GREAT SURVIVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In politics, the rewards go to those who are smart enough to save their own 
careers while disaster is striking those around them. 
</P>
<P>
Take Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, who's becoming the great 
survivor of local politics. 
</P>
<P>
He's a fascinating case study. His survival is due less to personal skill than 
to peculiarities of the California political system, which allows a local 
official to become his own power center by amassing campaign funds from 
businesses dependent on his votes. 
</P>
<P>
The disaster in question is the U.S. Justice Department's suit against the 
Board of Supervisors, charging that the boundaries of the five supervisorial 
districts are drawn in a manner that deprives Latinos of fair representation. 
Odds are strongly against the supervisors winning the suit. And now, after 
spending $1,245,493 to fight it, they are talking settlement. Dana, a 
Republican, has joined the two liberal Democrats on the board, Kenny Hahn and 
Ed Edelman, in supporting a settlement that would redraw the boundaries of the 
1st Supervisorial District in the San Gabriel Valley. This district has a 
substantial Latino population, and the new lines would strengthen the 
possibility that a Latino would be elected. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the new configuration would hurt the election chances of the 
incumbent, conservative Republican Pete Schabarum, whom many Latino political 
leaders oppose. 
</P>
<P>
Most important for Dana, the settlement would strengthen his standing in his 
own 4th District, which extends from Long Beach to Malibu. This is because it 
would remove Malibu from his district, freeing him of an area which hates his 
pro-development policies. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, the settlement proposal has become bogged down, and the redistricting 
case may go to trial after all. Even so, Dana's alliance with the Democrats is 
considered a stab in the back in the tight world of Republican politics. 
Schabarum is furious. Mike Antonovich, the third Republican, is unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
But Dana has stabbed Republican backs before and survived. 
</P>
<P>
I first met Dana in 1980 when he was running for supervisor against Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke. He was a telephone company executive who, with his wife, 
Doris, was an enthusiastic Republican volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Doris seemed more the mover and shaker, with Deane the one left to lug the 
coffee pot and bridge table at Republican fund-raisers. He mumbled and stumbled 
through speeches. He was awkward, even shy. 
</P>
<P>
But he had a win-at-all-costs kind of political campaign manager, Ron Smith, 
who followed Dana around with a black briefing book to prevent embarrassing 
mistakes. More important, Smith knew how to attack in an advertising campaign, 
first emphasizing Burke's liberalism and then, at the end, reminding the 
largely white constituency that Burke was black. 
</P>
<P>
Dana's candidacy was born among the Republican volunteer clubs of Long Beach 
and the Palos Verdes Peninsula. But he quickly stumbled on the essential truth 
of California local politics: that it has nothing to do with political parties. 
The law has required nonpartisan local elections for years, and the role of 
parties in such elections has diminished. 
</P>
<P>
Add to that the increasingly large amounts of non-party money available for 
supervisorial campaigns, and the net result is even less of a need to pay 
homage to party politics. This is particularly true in the districts 
represented by Dana and Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
Dana has received large contributions from land developers and related 
businesses, particularly those interested in Malibu and other coastal areas. 
Antonovich is supported by builders in the far northern San Fernando Valley and 
Santa Monica Mountain areas of his 5th District. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Antonovich has the wherewithal to be as independent as Dana. But he's 
long been a faithful party man -- as a former GOP legislator, a candidate for 
lieutenant governor and also for U.S. Senator. So he stuck by Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
Dana's another sort. He turned against the GOP in 1988 when he used his big 
political fund for an unsuccessful $772,000 campaign by his son, Deane III, 
against Republican Assemblyman Gerald L. Felando of San Pedro. Republicans 
still haven't forgiven him for that. 
</P>
<P>
Now Antonovich and Schabarum are demanding a trial for the redistricting case. 
Edelman and Hahn want a settlement. And it's Dana who will decide. The bottom 
line is that he has the financial independence to base his decision on what's 
best for him.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : COURT RULES SALON BIASED AGAINST AIDS 
PATIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Court of Appeals, reversing a lower court decision, ruled this 
week that Jessica's Nail Clinic discriminated against a West Hollywood man in 
1986 when it canceled his pedicure appointment after a manicurist discovered 
that the man had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In what was widely viewed as a test case, the court on Wednesday also upheld 
the validity of a West Hollywood ordinance that protects those with AIDS from 
discrimination by businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Gloria Allred filed suit in 1987 on behalf of Paul Jasperson, who died 
this last May of complications from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the salon, who won the first round in Superior Court, argued that 
sharp instruments used in a pedicure could puncture Jasperson's skin and expose 
others to the deadly AIDS virus. Jessica Vartoughian, owner of the salon, had 
no comment on the most recent decision.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH AGENCY MAY BE AUDITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials said that they will recommend an audit of the Los Angeles 
County Mental Health Department because of reports that the department has 
requested funds for programs that may be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the state auditor general's office said Thursday that an outside 
review of the department is needed because previous internal audits have failed 
to answer questions about discrepancies in the department's budget. 
</P>
<P>
The problems were disclosed earlier this year when it was discovered that state 
funds had been sought for programs the department wanted to end. Mental health 
department officials said they were forced to keep the programs open by a court 
order blocking the closure of eight county health clinics, but state 
authorities say the court order apparently didn't cover all of the programs. 
The audit request must be approved by the Legislature's Audit Committee next 
month.

INSURER FOR CARSON IN STATE HANDS; 
</P>
<P>
INSOLVENCY: AGENCY TAKES OVER FIRM COVERING CITY EMPLOYEES, SAYS CLAIMS WILL BE 
PAID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Carson employees who chose Pacific Standard Life Insurance Co. for life 
insurance and retirement savings policies have been notified that the state 
Department of Insurance has taken over the Davis-based company because it is 
insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
The state takeover, which occurred Dec. 11, followed a Nov. 28 Insurance 
Department order to Pacific Standard that it cease business. The move affects 
about 170 city employees, who together have paid about $313,000 in premiums to 
Pacific Standard in the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one of them," said Nancy Severtson, acting accountant and treasurer for 
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Local 809. "I 
don't know what's happening," she said. 
</P>
<P>
State and city officials attempted to reassure city employees. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Middleton, the person now running Pacific Standard for the Insurance 
Department, said in a phone interview that claims and benefits will be paid. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, no one with a Pacific Standard policy will be able to claim its 
cash value for six months, although they will have to continue to pay premiums. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Johnson, the city's financial consultant, said: "As far as we know at this 
point, the policies are still in effect. . . . The state indicates that they 
are going to assign the policies to different companies. It doesn't appear that 
the individual policies are threatened." 
</P>
<P>
Middleton said the Insurance Department conducted an examination this fall of 
Pacific Standard after learning of the financial troubles of Dallas-based 
Southmark Corp., a large diversified financial services and real estate company 
that acquired Pacific Standard in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The examination was scheduled because we knew the stock was owned by 
Southmark, and we knew Southmark had problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Southmark became one of the largest companies ever to seek bankruptcy 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
Middleton said the state's examination found that Pacific Standard had recently 
bought second mortgages and junk bonds, which violated state regulations for 
insurance company investments. 
</P>
<P>
"The relationship with Southmark has created problems for" Pacific Standard, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he and the newly appointed finance director, Lorraine Oten, "need 
to confer with the city attorney and the city administrator" about how Pacific 
Standard's troubles will affect Carson employees. 
</P>
<P>
About half of Carson's 350 full-time employees elected Pacific Standard when 
choosing life insurance and retirement savings plans. 
</P>
<P>
In Carson, Pacific Standard became controversial two years ago after it was 
learned that then-City Administrator John Dangleis had steered city insurance 
business to the firm without telling the City Council that he was affiliated 
with it as an insurance agent and that he was a friend and business associate 
of Peter Cobo, an insurance agent for Pacific Standard.

SCHOOLS EXAMINE SCREENING THAT LET CONVICTED MOLESTER THROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANKI V. RANSOM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego school officials are baffled by how a teacher, who was convicted of 
child molestation 12 years ago in Florida, passed through their hiring process 
with his criminal record undetected. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what happened, and are in the process of reviewing our screening 
process," Deputy Supt. Bertha Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
A teaching credential is not issued if a background check reveals a conviction, 
Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
All prospective teachers go through the screening, which includes submitting a 
resume, a reference list and copies of any teaching certificates from other 
states. A fingerprint check is made. The Commission for Teacher Credentialing 
makes the background checks. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe his criminal record didn't show up because he was acquitted in Florida," 
Pendleton said. Florida officials, however, said that Ernest B. Brown had been 
convicted of child molestation in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
After his conviction, Florida's education department revoked Brown's teaching 
license in 1978, said Martin Schaap, administrator for the Professional 
Practices Council in Florida. He said Brown resigned from Gulf Beaches 
Elementary School in St. Petersburg in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 47, was arrested in San Diego on Nov. 30 on suspicion of molesting two 
former students who are now in junior high school. He has been suspended from 
teaching while the case is pending, said Melanie Petersen, attorney for the 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
He is being held in the County Jail on 32 counts of lewd and lascivious acts 
with a child. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Jan. 11 in Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was hired by the San Diego Unified School District in 1986 and taught a 
combination fourth- and fifth-grade class at Knox Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton said Brown was considered a good teacher and was popular with parents 
and students. 
</P>
<P>
Crisis counselors were brought in to help students deal with the arrest, 
Pendleton said, adding that school officials met with parents and answered 
questions.

ALHAMBRA POLICE FATALLY SHOOT DRIVER WHO LUNGED AT OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alhambra police shot and killed an apparently unarmed man Thursday morning when 
he bolted from his car after a traffic stop and then charged a pursuing officer 
in a dark stairway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, in his 20s, was not identified. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the 
scene of the shooting, which occurred on a quiet block of apartment houses near 
the corner of Valley Boulevard and 4th Street. 
</P>
<P>
An officer stopped the man at the intersection about 4 a.m. after he observed 
him driving slowly in a maroon Honda Civic with no headlights on, said 
sheriff's deputies, who were asked to assist in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
During the stop, the driver was acting "suspiciously" and giving conflicting 
information about who owned the car, sheriff's spokesman Gabe Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer then called for a second patrol car, but the man ran off on 4th 
Street, "reaching toward his waistband as he ran," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers ran after him and were searching the area around an apartment 
building "when he suddenly appeared from a darkened stairway and charged" one 
of the policemen, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer fired once with his service revolver, striking the man in the 
chest. Neither of the officers was injured, and no weapons were found on the 
man or in the area, Ramirez said.

EL CAJON MAN KILLS WIFE, HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An elderly man killed his wife and then shot himself to death Thursday in El 
Cajon, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
The dead couple were identified as Orville Gladstone Meland, 90, and Ruthe 
Bestic Dolan Meland, 73. They lived in a mobile home on East Main Street, the 
coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they received a call just after 10 a.m. about "a problem" at the 
couple's residence. 
</P>
<P>
When officers arrived, they knocked on the front door but no one answered. The 
door was unlocked and police went inside. Orville Meland was sitting in a chair 
with his back to the door. He had a bullet wound in the head and was dead. 
</P>
<P>
On the kitchen floor, they found Mrs. Meland covered with a blanket. She too 
had been shot in the head and was dead, according to police and the coroner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Police found a note apparently written by the elderly man that said the couple 
had been having problems, and that he had killed his wife and then was going to 
kill himself.

EQUESTRIAN CENTER LOSSES FORCE LAYOFF OF 40 EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Forty people will lose their jobs in cutbacks at the financially troubled Los 
Angeles Equestrian Center, which lost more than $1 million in 1989, according 
to officials of Gibraltar Savings. 
</P>
<P>
The center's polo school, which served between 25-30 students, and restaurant 
will be closed indefinitely in an effort by Gibraltar to minimize the center's 
losses, James P. Boyle, Gibraltar's chief executive officer, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar's cost-cutting culminates a turbulent year for the savings and loan 
and the Equestrian Center, located on 70 acres of city property in Griffith 
Park. In March, federal regulators seized Gibraltar in the wake of heavy losses 
stemming in part from its commercial real estate troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar is the largest savings and loan being operated under federal 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Forty people -- 30 from the restaurant, five from the polo school, and five 
from administrative services -- will lose their jobs when the closures take 
effect Jan. 2, Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
The closures are the latest symptom of the Equestrian Center's continuing 
financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers really dictate that we have to take this action now," Boyle said. 
He declined to specify how much money the restaurant and polo school lose each 
month, but he estimated that Gibraltar has lost between $80,000 and $100,000 a 
month on the center since it foreclosed on J. Albert Garcia in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Resolution Trust Corp., a new federal agency formed to deal 
with the financial troubles of the nation's savings and loan institutions, have 
been seeking buyers for Gibraltar and expect to sell it before the middle of 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Before that happens, though, Gibraltar officials hope to sell the Equestrian 
Center lease to a group of businessmen led by a semi-retired Burbank banker. 
</P>
<P>
Their plans received a setback in August, they said, when the city Board of 
Recreation and Parks Commissioners rejected proposed changes in Gibraltar's 
lease agreement that would have made the center more marketable. 
</P>
<P>
The group is still considering the purchase, but in the meantime, "Gibraltar 
cannot continue to fund losses," said Richard Post, senior vice president of 
the savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar's announcement came in the wake of word from Cadillac, a sponsor of 
polo matches in the Equidome, that it was withdrawing its support, said Sako 
Baghdassarian, manager of the Equestrian Center. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdassarian said he has several prospective sponsors, but the future of polo 
matches at the center is cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant may open occasionally for big events, but most of the time the 
only food available will be snacks at concession windows, Post said. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons who board horses at the center said they were not upset by the 
announcement, saying few people ate at the restaurant because prices were high 
and service slow. But they said the restaurant could have been profitable under 
better management. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the closures, the center will operate at a deficit, and "if we need 
to make further service cuts we will," Boyle said, 
</P>
<P>
Gibraltar would consider reducing the number of boarding stalls and cutting the 
number of shows and special events at the center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1981 amid protests and legal challenges from nearby Burbank residents 
who feared noise, congestion and horse odors, the center has suffered losses of 
more than $27 million.

DRESS CODE SINGLES OUT BLACK GANGS, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER and PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prodded by a school board debate over a proposed dress code focused on black 
gangs, Antelope Valley Union High School district officials and sheriff's 
deputies said Thursday they will look into whether satanic and white power 
gangs are also a problem. 
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of the district's Board of Trustees Wednesday night, board 
President Larry Rucker charged that the dress policy, as proposed, targets 
black gang members but ignores other factions that create problems in the 
district's six schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an inordinate amount of kids who are into satanism," Rucker said. "Why 
that wasn't covered, that escapes me, and that's a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Kenneth Brummel said Thursday his staff will do additional study on the 
gang issue and return the dress code for another board discussion in January. 
</P>
<P>
"We will consult with the Sheriff's Department, and we will consult with the 
principals," he said. If satanic and white power gangs are found, he said, "We 
need to provide language in the dress code proposal that would cover those as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
The 10,000-student district for months has been considering a ban on 
gang-related attire. But the board debate appeared only to have mired board 
members in more disputes and raised new questions about the scope of the 
district's gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
During a more than hourlong debate, Rucker, the lone black member of the board, 
called the proposed dress code "institutional racism at best." He complained 
about alleged satanism among students and said there is evidence of skinhead 
and white power activity on the campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker called the board policy "a Crip and a Blood thing," referring to the two 
major black gangs, and challenged the board to consider other groups. Rucker 
noted district officials have not talked of outlawing combat boots and fatigues 
worn by some white gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow board member Sophia Waugh said members of the Crips and Bloods appear to 
have been involved in most of the region's gang problems. 
</P>
<P>
The district's proposed anti-gang dress code does not refer to specific gangs. 
But district officials, in discussing student clothing to be outlawed, 
generally referred to the blue and red clothing associated with the two black 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker repeatedly criticized both the district and Sheriff's Department 
officials for not producing statistics on the extent of the district's gang 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Gary Vance, commander of the sheriff's Antelope Valley station, said 
Thursday he received a letter from the school district only this week seeking 
statistics on local gang activity. He said he will provide the data. Vance said 
deputies have identified about 600 Antelope Valley youths with gang ties, 
mostly to the Bloods and Crips. 
</P>
<P>
He said there are no well-organized white power groups. "There are people of 
that persuasion, and they have been attempting to form gangs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vance added, "The kids tell us there are elements of satanism at the high 
schools, but as far as organized groups, we don't know of any." 
</P>
<P>
School board member Steve Landaker said a report from district administrators 
mentions satanic activity on local campuses. "I've also heard about it from my 
own children and from the Sheriff's Department and from probation officers," he 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
While other trustees said they are still uncertain how stringent a dress code 
is needed, board member E. Jarold Wright said Thursday he does not believe that 
is sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we're doing is attempting a Band-Aid approach," he said. "If I 
thought for a minute that eliminating headgear would eliminate the gang 
problem, I'd be all for it. If we want to deal with it, let's deal with it 
right -- like developing a policy that outlaws gangs" on the campus, he said.

</P>
<P>
Gibraltar's announcement came in the wake of another from the Cadillac division 
of General Motors Corp., which had been subsidizing polo matches in the 
Equidome, that it was withdrawing its sponsorship, said Sako Baghdassarian, 
manager of the equestrian center. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdassarian said he has several prospective sponsors, but the future of polo 
matches at the center is cloudy. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant may open occasionally for big events, but most of the time, the 
only food available will be snacks at concession windows, Post said. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1981 amid protests and legal challenges from residents who feared 
noise, congestion and odor, the center has suffered losses of more than $27 
million.

RTD GIVES IN, COMPROMISES ON CONTROL OF METRO RAIL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After weeks of bickering, the Southern California Rapid Transit District Board 
of Directors on Thursday agreed to a compromise plan that resolves its dispute 
with the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission over which agency will 
control Metro Rail construction. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-4 vote came after some intense behind-the-scenes negotiating convinced a 
majority of the RTD board that it would lose all control over development of 
the 17.2-mile subway unless the compromise was approved. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement -- which still must be ratified by the commission -- turns all 
Metro Rail design and construction over to a new third agency, the Rail 
Construction Corp. This nonprofit corporation was created by the commission to 
supervise building of all rail transit projects in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials hailed the RTD board's vote as a significant step toward 
resolving differences between the two agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased that the RTD has finally agreed to join the (Rail 
Construction Corp.)," said Commission Chairwoman Christine E. Reed. She said 
the agreement is "a step in the right direction," and suggested it will help 
"bring together, under one agency, the management of all transportation 
programs in the county." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Metro Rail project was initiated by the RTD, the state Legislature 
subsequently created the commission to oversee all rail construction in the 
county. This authority also gives the commission control over the Metro Rail 
purse strings. The project is being built with federal, state and local money. 
</P>
<P>
The RTD is building the $1.4-billion first phase of Metro Rail, tunneling 4.4 
miles from Union Station to MacArthur Park. That part of the project is over 
budget and behind schedule, according to a commission audit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the RTD had contracted with the commission to design and build the 
project's second phase, extending the line 6.8 miles from MacArthur Park to 
Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. It was assumed that the district would 
also be in charge of building the final leg into North Hollywood sometime in 
the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
If Thursday's RTD action is accepted by the commission, as expected, the RTD 
board will no longer be directly in charge of design and construction. That 
authority will go to the Rail Construction Corp.'s board. 
</P>
<P>
According to the compromise, the RTD will be able to fill three of the six 
seats on the new corporation's board. A seventh, tie-breaking board member will 
be selected jointly by the six members. Board members must all be experienced 
in developing big transit projects, according to the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's vote was a defeat for RTD board President Gordana Swanson, who had 
fought to retain exclusive control of Metro Rail construction. She and her 
supporters feel the Rail Construction Corp. was formed by the commission to 
further its Metro Rail takeover plans. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a peace offering . . . it's an abomination," Swanson said of the 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
She accused the majority of caving in to bludgeoning tactics of the commission 
and warned that the compromise agreement is illegal because it does not have 
the approval of the city of Los Angeles and the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden sided with Swanson in testimony before 
the vote was taken. He told the RTD directors that the proposed agreement 
violates the existing agreements between the city and the commission and warned 
that "this illegal agreement" could stall the project and result in more cost 
overruns. 
</P>
<P>
It was cost overruns and project delays in the first phase of construction that 
prompted the commission to step in and take more control over Metro Rail, 
commission officials said. When the RTD board initially refused to participate 
in these efforts, the commission voted to oust the RTD and take over the job. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's action by the RTD board headed off that total takeover by the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the agreement, the RTD will not only have three seats on the 
Rail Construction Corp. board but also will continue to have a role in building 
the subway. The RTD's Metro Rail staff will continue to work on design and 
construction of the project's next phases, as contract employees assigned to 
the Rail Construction Corp., commission officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the new corporation to take over completion of the 
4.4-mile first phase, as well as design and construction of the final stages of 
the project, Commission Executive Director Neil Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
The actions of the commission and the RTD must still be approved by the federal 
Urban Mass Transit Administration, which pays half of the project costs. UMTA 
officials have refused to take sides in the dispute, saying that the issue must 
be settled by the two agencies before second-phase construction money can be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
While the immediate conflict over Metro Rail construction may be resolved by 
Thursday's compromise, both agencies indicated that their basic disagreements 
are so deeply rooted that they can only be resolved by the Legislature.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: JOHN GARDINER'S RANCHO VALENCIA IS QUICK TO TAKE 
ON A GENTEEL AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At some point during a phone call for reservations in the dining room at the 
new John Gardiner's Rancho Valencia resort hotel near Rancho Santa Fe, the 
maitre d' will ask, in the most discreet tone, "Have you dined with us before?" 
</P>
<P>
Should you respond in the negative, he will then say, in the gentlest of 
voices, "Gentlemen are required to wear coat and tie in the evening." 
</P>
<P>
If you reply "I certainly hope so," you may get an especially choice table at 
which to sample the buttery veal chops in French curry sauce; the herbed, 
roasted lamb from Sonoma County and the clever ginger custard with poached 
pears. If, on the other hand, the idea of dressing for dinner seems unbearably 
stressful, there are many other restaurants in North County. 
</P>
<P>
However, none of the alternatives has the charming and almost seductively suave 
ambience of the dining room at this small luxury retreat, which consists of 
only 43 suites and seems the sort of secluded resort that well-heeled 
out-of-towners would expect to find in the coastal hills of San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The decor might be summed up as Spanish Mission Deluxe, and although quite new, 
the place somehow has acquired the genteel air that usually comes only with 
maturity. Tennis legend John Gardiner often occupies a corner table and lends 
something to the mood; a pianist plays quietly behind a bank of rhododendron, 
and the service is almost astonishing in an age in which so many servers seem 
to be manning gas pumps rather than assisting guests. The servers are present 
whenever needed, and watchful at other times; thank one for performing some 
service or other, and you likely will receive a murmured "C'est un plaisir" in 
reply. 
</P>
<P>
The menu, written daily and supervised by Chef Serge Backes, who is new to the 
area and seems possessed of considerable talent, fleshes out the dining room's 
tone of understated luxury. It runs, surprisingly for so small a hotel, to 
considerable length, and, on one recent evening, offered 15 appetizers, an 
equal number of entrees and nearly as many desserts. The cooking style is 
purely French and quite classic, in the sense that, although some dishes may be 
updated, all are based on traditional principles. 
</P>
<P>
Prices reflect the unabated upward spiral seen in California restaurants in 
recent months, with starters and desserts averaging $7 and most entrees priced 
in the mid-20s. (The prices of appetizers and desserts at almost every sort of 
restaurant seem to be rising to almost ridiculous heights these days. 
Restaurateurs explain the situation by saying that they no longer make money on 
entrees and have to turn to these auxiliary courses for their profits.) 
</P>
<P>
The menu seems designed for appetites fueled by a day on the tennis courts 
(especially with the massive platter of chilled shellfish with lime cocktail 
sauce), yet it also shows consideration for contemporary dietary concerns, with 
low-calorie, -sodium and -cholesterol dishes marked by asterisks. These have 
included baked salmon with mussels in watercress sauce, broiled ono with caviar 
and beurre blanc, and, rather interestingly, a New York sirloin with mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer list is particularly lovely and has included such things as 
saffroned mussel soup; a salad of squab, endive and greens; an imaginative 
preparation of snails in black bean sauce with tofu, as well as a more 
traditional offering of snails flavored with Pernod; Florentine meat and 
vegetable fritters and a very classic dish of sauteed sweetbreads in a puff 
pastry bouchee. This last was perfect and luscious, the melting meat enrobed in 
a supple cream sauce flavored with pan juices and good brandy. 
</P>
<P>
Rather out of form for a French restaurant, but quite in step with current 
American eating habits, the menu offers several pastas as entrees, including 
versions garnished with smoked salmon and cream, or with sauteed vegetables, 
olive oil and mixed cheeses, or an extravagant linguine with shellfish, wine 
and herbs that at $25 probably sets the price record for a pasta dish in this 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The more formal entrees are characterized by cautious, watchful cooking that 
results in finely finished meats and exquisite sauces. Those based on stock are 
reduced to a velvety consistency and flavored precisely to match the meat they 
garnish. This applied especially to a boned, roasted breast of Muscovy duck, 
served a la Bigarade in a light brown sauce flavored with cherries and brandy. 
The duck breast had been roasted to the exact point at which the meat remained 
tender and moist, while the skin crisped as the fat sizzled away. The kitchen 
carved this into slices and arranged them in a fan before sending the plate out 
under a silver dome. 
</P>
<P>
The sauteed veal chops probably were finished in the oven, a simple French 
trick that does not appear in cookbooks and does not seem well understood by 
American-trained cooks. In any case, the meat was exceptionally toothsome -- 
veal chops, though costly and luxurious, too often are cooked into tasteless 
hunks of meat -- and the sauce, a French-style curry of some sweetness and 
considerable heat, was amazing. This sort of sauce, unlike a true Indian curry, 
includes brown sauce, fruit and curry powder, and can be either flat or deep. 
This one had fine depth. 
</P>
<P>
A third entree, roasted venison in green peppercorn sauce, came off just as 
well as the others, the meat gamy and beautifully roasted, and well-served by 
both its strong, piquant sauce and by the tangy compote of lingonberries that 
garnished the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Vegetables arrived in quite the French style, in a manner that never occurs in 
this area except at occasional banquets given by dining societies. The kitchen 
arranged a silver platter of buttery turnips, slender green beans and roasted 
potatoes for the table, and the server, using two spoons, dished these out in 
individual bouquets. The vegetables no doubt would have tasted the same had 
they been plated in the kitchen, but the elegance of the presentation added to 
the overall tone of the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert list has a certain seasonal inspiration and has included such 
things as pumpkin bread pudding and spicy pumpkin souffle. Chocolate, 
increasingly the mainstay of dessert lists, here is honored by a souffle but 
also by a fine, gooey tart garnished with caramelized apricots, whose intense 
flavor goes so well with chocolate. It is an excellent dessert.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 MEN, WOMAN ROB TARZANA JEWELRY STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three robbers escaped with jewels worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from a 
Tarzana store just as its employees were closing up, Los Angeles police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Two men and a woman entered Marcel's Unique Jewelry in the 19300 block of 
Ventura Boulevard about 6 p.m. Wednesday as two employees were closing for the 
night and the business' two safes were open, Detective Vic Morett said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men pointed guns at the employees and ordered them onto the floor. The 
robbers emptied both safes of a variety of jewelry and unset gems and left 
through the front door, Morett said. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the stolen merchandise has not been determined but Morett 
estimated that the loss could be in excess of $300,000, based on the wholesale 
cost of what was taken.

MEETERS, GOD-SPEEDERS ARE ADVISED TO AVOID LINDBERGH FIELD MESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANNETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of an expected crunch of people and traffic, Lindbergh Field 
authorities are urging travelers, families and friends to say their farewells 
at home instead of at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
About 37,000 holiday travelers are expected to pass through the airport today 
and again on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
On an average day, about 30,000 fliers use the airport. Another 60,000 -- 
people the airline industry calls "meeters and God-speeders" -- are there to 
wish the traveler well, said Jim Anderson, a spokesman for the Port of San 
Diego, which operates the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"The airport has been pretty busy during the entire holiday period, but traffic 
is expected to peak today and tomorrow, and again Jan. 2 and 3 when travelers 
return home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The parking lots will be full, Anderson said. "Plan on not leaving the car at 
the airport." 
</P>
<P>
Travelers should have someone drop them off at the airport, or they should take 
a cab or shuttle bus. Airport shuttles are available free from parking lots on 
Kettner Boulevard and in the downtown area that caters to airport travelers, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the name of the game when dropping people off at the terminal curb is to 
drop them off and leave them there, or go to the parking lot and park, he said. 
Parking regulations that permit loading and unloading only will be strictly 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people will park their car at the curb and then go look for the arriving 
party or take somebody into the terminal. The rule is you can pull up to curb, 
but you must be actively loading or unloading the car. Someone just sitting in 
the car is not active." 
</P>
<P>
To make travel less stressful, travelers should allow plenty of time to get to 
the airport. They should plan to arrive at least an hour before their 
departure, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Crowds are greater, and it takes longer to get into the terminal," he said. 
Also, if travelers should miss their flight, they may not be able to schedule 
another. "So many flights are booked," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers should also try to buy their tickets in advance so they can check 
their luggage at the curb and go directly to their departure gate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also helpful for travelers to put Christmas packages in their luggage" 
instead of carrying them on board, Anderson said. Sometimes guards at the 
security checkpoints cannot determine what is in the package and may have to 
open it. 
</P>
<P>
The fewer the packages, the more time will be saved at security checkpoints, 
Anderson said.

END OF SAN DIEGO'S DRIEST YEAR NEARS AS MILD WEATHER CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's almost embarrassing. Winter officially arrived at 1:22 p.m. Thursday and, 
while much of the rest of the country was being buried under snow and buffeted 
by strong winds, the best San Diego could muster was 600 minutes of hazy 
sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
True, the high here Thursday was a bracing 64 degrees, but it's hard to 
complain when contrasted with the 43 degrees below zero in Havre, Mont. San 
Diego's extended holiday forecast is for slight warming. 
</P>
<P>
There will be some patchy fog tonight along the coast and inland, said National 
Weather Service forecaster Wilbur Shigehara. 
</P>
<P>
A high pressure system hovering over the west is protecting Southern California 
from the storms affecting the rest of the country, Shigehara said. If the dry, 
clear weather continues through to the new year as expected, 1989 will go down 
as the driest year on record in San Diego, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
There has been only 2.82 inches of rain since Jan 1, Shigehara said. The driest 
year on record was 1863, with 3.02 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Beach highs today will range from 58 to 63 degrees, rising between 60 and 65 on 
the weekend, Shigehara said. The surf is holding steady at 3 feet, and the 
ocean water temperature is a chilly 59 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Highs along the coast today are expected to range from 63 to 68 degrees. Highs 
Saturday through Christmas Day will be from 67 to 72, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal lows of 43 to 53 are forecast tonight, 40 to 50 Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Inland highs today will range from 65 to 72, and from 68 to 75 Saturday through 
Monday. Overnight lows through Christmas Eve will be from 35 to 40, Shigehara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There may be light frost at night in some of the coldest inland areas, but 
nothing threatening to local agriculture, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Daytime temperatures in the mountains are projected to hold in the mid-50s 
through Christmas Day. Overnight lows will range from 23 to 33. 
</P>
<P>
Desert highs today will range from 70 to 75 degrees, and be near 80 Sunday and 
Christmas Day, Shigehara said. Lows will be in the low 30s.

SIMI POLICEWOMAN FILES HARASSMENT SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Simi Valley policewoman has sued the city, charging that she was sexually 
harassed and improperly demoted because she was blamed for misconduct charges 
brought against her ex-husband, one of seven officers named as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit filed Wednesday in Ventura Superior Court, Officer Florence Trapani 
says she became the target of a biased internal investigation, was improperly 
removed from her post as a drug abuse resistance education (DARE) officer and 
was warned she would receive no help from other officers in an emergency after 
she was reassigned to patrol duties. 
</P>
<P>
Trapani alleges that she was blamed for the personnel problems of her 
ex-husband, Michael Bender, a popular detective. 
</P>
<P>
Trapani's suit asks for an unspecified amount of money for loss of income and 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
"We're mainly looking to get her reputation back," said her attorney, William 
Rehwald of Woodland Hills. He said Trapani, 32, has been on stress leave from 
the department since her reassignment in August. Bender, 34, also is on leave. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley City Atty. John Torrance, City Manager Lynn Koester and Police 
Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller declined comment. Officials have said privately 
that the Police Department became ensnared in the divorce and ensuing child 
custody fight between the two officers. 
</P>
<P>
Bender and Trapani were divorced in 1985. Trapani had been widely recognized 
for her work in the DARE program. Bender was named the department's officer of 
the year in 1983 and has repeatedly earned the title "Toughest Cop Alive" in 
the biennial World Police and Fire Games. 
</P>
<P>
Rehwald said the couple's divorce became a smoke screen for gender 
discrimination in the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the department's 105 officers are women. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rehwald, Trapani's problems began last winter when she accused 
Bender of attempting to fondle her in the police gym. During the department's 
ensuing investigation, evidence surfaced that Bender had secretly taped 
conversations with his ex-wife and others, a violation of state law. The 
district attorney's office declined to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
The department's charges of sexual harassment and making illegal tapes were 
eventually sustained against Bender. He has appealed to the city Personnel 
Department. Bender faces a possible 10-day suspension and pay cut of $115 per 
month for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Harassment of Trapani by other officers became so intense that Miller decided 
to transfer her to the Ventura County Police Academy as a training officer 
until the controversy died down, Rehwald said. The suit says Trapani was told 
in writing that her reassignment was temporary and that she would be returned 
to the DARE program in six months. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, she was removed from the DARE program instead and 
assigned to patrol duty, only to be told by a supervisor that fellow officers 
would not back her on the street or respond to her radio calls for help. 
</P>
<P>
Named as defendants were the city of Simi Valley; Miller; Bender, and Officers 
Michael Brewer, Rex Jones, Gary Collins, Ron Lompart, John St. Laurent and Glen 
Peterson.

ELECTION CHANGE IN CARSON IS DEFEATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By George Stein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attempt by Carson Councilwoman Vera Robles DeWitt to have the council 
elected by districts and the mayor elected by voters fell flat this week, but 
not before accusations of self-interest and spite enlivened an otherwise 
routine council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt, who wanted the issue put before voters in the April 10 municipal 
election, said at-large elections have been successfully challenged elsewhere 
as discriminatory against minorities and that district elections would cut the 
cost of campaigning, reducing the need "to rely on special interests to finance 
campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
Her motion to have city staff prepare the ballot measure died without a second, 
but several residents and council members commented on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Michael Mitoma countered one of DeWitt's arguments by saying that the 
two-man, three-woman council, which is composed of a black, two Anglos, an 
Asian and a Latina, already is balanced ethnically. 
</P>
<P>
Carson resident Roy Goodson accused DeWitt of sponsoring the move because she 
is "a little perturbed" that she was not elected mayor by the council early 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Sylvia Muise disputed DeWitt's statement that $25,000 is needed to 
campaign in Carson. Muise said she had spent $2,000 in her first campaign and 
$14,000 in her second. 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt retorted that Muise had needed more funds the second time "because you 
were under investigation" for allegedly concealing campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
Muise heatedly responded, "In 1978, I reported money inaccurately. I didn't 
hide it. I called the (district attorney) myself. Ignorance is no excuse, but I 
did not know the law." George Stein

<P>
A schoolteacher was arrested after 19 charges of child molestation were filed 
against him by the San Diego County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
John Patrick Busker, 27, of La Mesa, surrendered to Sheriff's Detective Mary 
Stables in his attorney's office Wednesday about 4:30 p.m., Detective Dana 
Gassaway said. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from incidents that allegedly occurred at Chet F. Harritt 
Elementary School in Santee. In late November, nine girls, ages 8 through 11, 
complained that a "substitute teacher had touched them in areas that made them 
feel uncomfortable," Sheriff's Lt. Jerry Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
Busker was released Thursday on a $75,000 bond. He is scheduled for arraignment 
Wednesday.

The video store bandit struck again Thursday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was a video store in the 2900 block of Alta View Drive in San 
Diego. It was the 13th robbery of a video store since September. 
</P>
<P>
The armed bandit walked into the Video Discount Store shortly after 11 a.m., 
police spokesman Bill Robinson said, adding that the man was carrying what 
looked like a Christmas present wrapped in red paper. He showed a revolver to 
an employee and made off with about $150. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Jerry Moody said the robber appears to be the same man who has robbed other 
video stores in San Diego, National City and Chula Vista.

A Rancho Penasquitos teen-ager was ordered Thursday to stand trial for murder 
in the gang-related death of another teen-ager Nov. 18 at a Mira Mesa taco 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
John Michael Mizicko, 19, who is the only one among two other co-defendants who 
is an adult, is charged with killing Raymond Jose, 17, outside a taco stand at 
Reagan Road and Mira Mesa Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The two juveniles, both 17 and also from Rancho Penasquitos, are being handled 
in Juvenile Court so far, but the San Diego County district attorney's office 
is seeking to have them tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Richard Hanscom ordered Mizicko to appear Jan. 4 in 
Superior Court for setting of a trial date and arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Security was tight at the hearing, as all spectators had to go through a metal 
detector before entering the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Mizicko's attorney, Ramon Castro, told reporters that a gang of 
people rushed toward Mizicko and his friends in a car, and that he fired in 
self-defense.

CAN CRAIGS PULL PADRES' WEIGHT?

<P>
Jenny Craig and her husband, Sid, are trying to do with diets what Ray Kroc did 
with hamburgers -- make them available to a large number of people at a 
relatively low cost. 
</P>
<P>
And they are also trying to do what he did with the Padres -- own them. 
</P>
<P>
Padre players now joke about Lean Cuisine in the clubhouse, aerobics before 
batting practice and calorie counting after shagging flies. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Craig Inc. has been one of the fastest growing companies in the nation. 
Revenues have increased by more than 50% in each of the past three years. The 
company had revenues in excess of $150 million for the fiscal year that ended 
June 30, 1989. Assets reached almost $14 million in the 1988 fiscal year, or 
more than triple the previous year's. The company's net worth was listed at 
$3.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Is that enough for them to play in the big leagues? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd think they'd have to have other financial sources," said Cedric Tallis, a 
former general manager of the New York Yankees and the Kansas City Royals and 
now executive director of a Tampa Bay group seeking financing for a baseball 
franchise. "No. 1, they've got to have beaucoup bucks and be baseball 
enthusiasts. It's a tough racket, it takes a lot of money to ante into the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
But company officials are quick to point out that Jenny Craig International 
Weight Loss Centres would not own the major league baseball team. Del Mar 
residents Jenny and Sid Craig would. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Jerry Kapstein, negotiating the sale for his mother-in-law, Padre 
owner Joan Kroc, is expected to finalize it after the holidays, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kapstein refused to divulge even if the Craigs are involved in 
negotiations, although the Craigs have told friends and associates that they 
will be the new owners. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny and Sid Craig quietly built one of the top diet chains in the burgeoning 
weight-loss industry, which cashes in on the weight-loss hopes of an estimated 
48 million Americans. But today, with their interest in buying the Padres, 
their low profile is rising. 
</P>
<P>
"I never heard of Jenny Craig until all this stuff about the Padres -- it's a 
wonderful public relations opportunity," said one former baseball executive. 
"Ray Kroc used to say whatever he spent on purchasing the team, he got millions 
back in publicity for McDonald's hamburgers. It's crazy what happens in the 
sports pages." 
</P>
<P>
As rumors fly about the Craigs buying the Padres, the two have sought shelter 
at their Aspen, Colo., vacation home. Both Craigs, now on a skiing vacation, 
have declined requests for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Kroc normally dislikes advance publicity on big business deals. She assumed 
ownership of the team in 1984 after the death of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Are Jenny, the dame of diets, and Sid, a former dance instructor, the stuff of 
Padre owners? 
</P>
<P>
Today, a smorgasbord of people own major league baseball teams. Marge Schott, 
who owns a car dealership in Cincinnati, also owns the Reds. The president's 
son, George W. Bush, heads a group that owns the Texas Rangers. Gene Autry, who 
played in cowboy movies and sang, owns the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
There's even a precedent for a diet king owning a professional sports franchise 
-- Harold Katz, founder of Nutri/System, purchased the Philadelphia 76ers of 
the NBA in July 1981. For most team owners, though, the common denominator is 
money -- and lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
Some sources say the couple might not have enough money to swing the deal but 
that they have a New York partner, a tidbit -- not yet proven -- that spurs 
wild speculation in baseball circles. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are selling for about $100 million, said Steven Matt, manager of 
appraisals and valuations at the Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. in Dallas. But the 
expense does not stop there. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the criteria for the team's sale, major league owners request that 
new owners have $200 million in operating revenue. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fortune magazine, Jenny Craig Inc. earned $30 million in pre-tax 
profits during 1988 on revenues of $200 million. During that year, Inc. 
magazine touted Jenny Craig as the sixth-fastest growing private company in the 
country, basing its rating on the young company's 21,000% growth from the 
previous year. As the company's growth began to slow in 1989, the rating 
dropped to 448th. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the company completed private placement of $100 million in 
secured and unsecured debt securities with a group of lenders: T.A. Associates 
of Boston, New York Life Insurance, Security Pacific National Bank and the Bank 
of New York. 
</P>
<P>
For the Craigs, particularly Sid, the move to baseball is a natural one. Sid 
has always loved baseball and, as a treat, occasionally takes employees to 
games. His colleagues describe him as a fairly laid-back fan. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a screamer," said Coleman Kane, director of advertising for the San 
Diego-based company. 
</P>
<P>
To beef up his knowledge of the baseball industry and learn about the minor 
leagues and scouting operations, Sid Craig, 57, met recently with a former 
general manager of a major league team. 
</P>
<P>
"The man is a marketing genius -- if it were up to me, I'd give him the team," 
said the former general manager, who asked that his name not be published. 
</P>
<P>
As the sports grapevine buzzes, the questions center on the identity of the 
Craigs' supposed partner and whether the couple is, in fact, the leading 
contender in the field of potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who sold for $12 million in 1974, are considered to be among the 
top franchises in the major leagues. In 1989, they drew two million fans for 
the second time in history. Although the club does not release a profit-loss 
statement, it made about $4 million profit for the fiscal year ending Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources in the baseball industry, the Padres have made a profit in 
five of the past six years. Their TV and radio revenue also will double 
beginning next season, providing about $18 million from national, local and 
cable broadcasting outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcasting revenue alone would cover the player payroll for the 1990 season. 
They mailed all their player contracts and already have their 10 highest-priced 
players signed in 1990 for a total of $10.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
A sale cannot be officially consummated until the major league owners' 
quarterly meeting March 7 in Dallas. The 12 National League teams must approve 
the sale by three-quarters majority; the 14 American League teams can approve 
it by simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
The league will require the Padres' new owner to have a significant "community 
identification" and name one person as ultimately responsible for all club 
decisions, according to a spokesman from the baseball commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, meanwhile, remain mum on the sale. They were caught off-guard when 
Kroc announced Oct. 17 that she had put them on the market and in the two 
months since have remained in the dark about negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"All we know is from what we hear and read in the newspapers," said Jack 
McKeon, manager and vice president for baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon and Padre players are anxious to see the deal finalized, so they'll know 
who their boss will be for the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to see this thing get done," said right fielder Tony Gwynn, who 
has been in the Padre organization since 1981. "Hopefully, the new owners will 
understand that although this is a business operation, you can't run it like 
any other business. You've got to have an open-minded owner who knows that 
things in baseball change constantly, from salaries to players to managers." 
</P>
<P>
The Craigs are accustomed to change. Today, Jenny drives a 1989 Rolls Royce 
sedan, and Sid tools around in a 1987 Porsche, but they both hail from modest 
roots. As Sid grew up in Vancouver, Canada, his mother and father worked in a 
dress shop, according to previously published reports. Jenny's father worked 
three different jobs in her hometown, Berwick, La. 
</P>
<P>
Stationed at Coronado by the Navy, Sid taught dancing in the evenings at an 
Arthur Murray studio. After high school, Jenny worked at a dental clinic, and 
at 22, she married. In her first marriage, she gained 45 pounds during a 
difficult pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to prove to myself and my family that I could get back into my 
pre-pregnancy shape," said Jenny, 56. "It was easy to motivate myself when none 
of my clothes fit even months after the baby was born." 
</P>
<P>
Jenny joined a health club and worked out with such enthusiasm and dedication 
that the gym owner offered her a job helping others lose weight. Within several 
years, Jenny owned and managed her own facility in New Orleans -- a spot she 
gave up in 1978 to come to Los Angeles-based Body Contour Inc. There, she met 
Sid Craig, then president of the company. One year later, they married. 
</P>
<P>
Their marriage became a business partnership as well. Jenny exudes a charm that 
fosters fierce loyalty among dieters and friends, colleagues say. Many describe 
her as the "people person" who strives to make the diet centers warm, 
supportive environments and writes personal thank-you notes to clients. Sid is 
credited with being the marketing whiz. The two, both workaholics, are athletic 
and enjoy skiing and tennis. They also like watching their race horses run at 
Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The Craigs sold Body Contour, and because of a non-competition clause that 
prevented them from setting up shop in the United States, they moved to 
Australia and spent one year and $1 million developing a line of diet foods. On 
May 9, 1983, they launched their effort by opening nine centers in Melbourne. 
But there were problems. The government forced the Craigs to discard 100,000 
boxes of vitamins because they contained a substance that requires a 
prescription in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The centers were not immediately successful in Australia, a country unfamiliar 
with weight-loss centers before the Craigs' arrival. But after a marketing 
blitz, the company took hold. Today, Jenny Craig has 96 centers in Australia, 
30 in England and 11 in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the couple returned to the United States to kick off their business 
and garner a piece of what is currently a $1.5 billion industry annually. 
Though there are currently 269 U.S. Jenny Craig centers, company officials hope 
to expand to 1,000 by the year 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The Craigs found and catered to a changing orientation in dieting. In 1986, 65 
million -- or about one in three -- Americans said they were dieting, according 
to the Calorie Control Council, a group that represents diet food 
manufacturers. Today, that number has dropped to one in four. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a changing perception of what dieting means -- what used to be 
considered a diet is now considered a healthy life style," said Keith Keeney, 
council spokesman. "There is a different dieter out there who is not looking 
for a miracle weight loss. Many want the Jenny Craig approach that helps with 
behavior and offers support." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Craig program, clients pay $185 and receive group and individual 
counseling. Until half the desired weight is lost, clients purchase only Jenny 
Craig meals, pre-packaged and frozen foods. A week of Craig cuisine costs 
between $50 to $75. 
</P>
<P>
And like many diets, some people swear by it, including movie star Elliot Gould 
and LA Law's Susan Rutan, both of whom have done television commercials for 
Jenny Craig. Television's Ed McMahon, who is not a spokesman for the company, 
says he lost 30 pounds on the diet and that the food is delicious. McMahon, a 
6-4 former football player, now weighs 200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Craigs do buy the Padres, Gwynn, the 5-11 right fielder, mentioned 
no plans to start the Craig diet, though he is trying to slim down. But the 
four-time batting champion said he welcomes a new regime. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they're committed to keeping the club in San Diego and keeping a 
winning team on the field," he said, "that's all we can ask for."

LOYOLA HAS TWO CLOSE SHAVES; 
</P>
<P>
COLLGE BASKETBALL: THE FIRST WAS GUARD TERRELL LOWERY'S NEW HAIRCUT, THE SECOND 
WAS THE LIONS SLIM WIN OVER OREGON STATE. 
</P>

<P>
It didn't work for Samson. It worked for Terrell Lowery. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount sophomore guard sported the Yul Brynner look Tuesday when 
the Lions visited Oregon State, and he had a major hand in events as Loyola 
upset the Beavers in a close shave, 117-113. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery hadn't planned on going bald, but he didn't care for the trim teammate 
and team barber Marcellus Lee was giving him that afternoon, so he had Lee take 
all of it off. 
</P>
<P>
That evening, Lowery hit seven of nine shots, scored 18 points and hit two free 
throws with 19 seconds left to clinch the victory. He had missed a free throw 
minutes earlier, but down the stretch he had a driving layup, made a key assist 
to Bo Kimble (to account for the last of Kimble's school-record 53 points) and 
added the clutch free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he'd come back and make (the free throws)," Loyola Coach Paul Westhead 
said. "He's a confident kid." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, who was upset with himself for missing the free throw with 3:11 left, 
said he had no doubts about the last ones. His thought when he went to the 
line? "It's down. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little disappointed on my (missed) free throw before. I didn't set 
myself. The second time I had a little smile on my face. I knew I was gonna 
redeem myself." 
</P>
<P>
Now he can work on redeeming his hair. "Credit my haircut to Marcellus. He was 
supposed to cut it in a designer way, but he didn't, so I said cut it all. But 
it worked." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, who plays off the bench as both point and shooting guard, raised his 
season average to 16.3 but is rarely noticed in the nightly scoring records 
recorded by Kimble and Hank Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
Also lost in Kimble's third straight 50-point barrage was Jeff Fryer's return 
to form. The senior guard, coming back from a broken hand, has been wearing a 
padded brace that has impeded his shooting. But Fryer, held to seven points in 
the first half Tuesday, got hot after intermission and canned five straight 
three-pointers to finish with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Fryer was a pleasant plus," Westhead said. "When he started shooting, he 
didn't even see the basket. He just turned and fired them. He's like (Kirk) 
Gibson at the plate. He keeps swinging." 
</P>
<P>
Fryer said the hand bothered him in the first half but he began to get more 
comfortable later. "The second half I knew I had to shoot a little more. I just 
got in my groove. It felt good. Once I got a feel for it I knew it was gonna go 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, who attempted only two three-pointers and did most of his work inside, 
said Fryer's sudden long-range onslaught changed the game. "I think that 
stunned (Oregon State)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With Gathers out of the lineup again Saturday against Oklahoma at Loyola at 9 
p.m., the Lions will need more big games from Fryer and Lowery -- and, 
obviously, Kimble -- to pull off another upset. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer said he will not have to wear the protective brace Saturday. "That will 
make life a lot easier," he noted.

KIMBLE TOPS 50 POINTS 3 TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Kimble's scoring assault during Hank Gathers' absence is taking on epic 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble goes into Saturday's Oklahoma game with three straight performances of 
more than 50 points (his 57 against Athletes in Action isn't officially 
recognized as part of the schedule), raising memories of the late 1960s when 
the likes of Pete Maravich, Calvin Murphy, Rick Mount and Elvin Hayes made 
nightly raids on the record books. 
</P>
<P>
Maravich, who set most NCAA scoring records for Louisiana State, scored 50 or 
more 10 times, including three in succession as a junior -- 66 against Tulane, 
50 against Florida and 54 against Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, a scoring whiz at Niagara, scored 50 points six times, including a 
one-week span as a junior when he got 50 against St. Peter's, Buffalo and 
Syracuse. Notre Dame scoring star Austin Carr managed back-to-back 50-point 
games three times, including 61 against Ohio and 52 against Kentucky in the 
1970 NCAA Tournament. Mississippi's Johnny Neumann hit 53 against Vanderbilt 
and 60 against Baylor in successive games in 1970. Mount of Purdue, Hayes of 
Houston, Bill Bradley of Princeton and Rick Barry of Miami are among the 
all-time collegiate scoring stars who never managed back-to-back 50-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, with 51 against UC Santa Barbara and 53 against Oregon State, has 
raised his season average to 34.4, which tops the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
What is unusual about Kimble's increased production is that he has shot fewer 
three-pointers and is working inside with Gathers out. Basically, he's scoring 
for two. 
</P>
<P>
"I and my teammates try to make ourselves versatile so that we can play other 
positions," Kimble said. "I'm trying to show my leadership. I wanted to take 
the ball inside to replace Hank. I figure if I can take the ball to the basket 
I have a higher percentage (of making the shot)." 
</P>
<P>
In his recent spree, Kimble has hit 35 of 51 shots, 22 of 23 free throws and 
six of seven three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Even his teammates were amazed at how tough the 6-foot-5 Kimble has been on the 
boards in Gathers' absence. He had 12 rebounds against Oregon State and 16 in 
the exhibition against Athletes in Action. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great outside shooter," Lions Coach Paul Westhead said, "but he may be 
even better inside." 
</P>
<P>
Earl Martin's demeanor usually reflects his nickname -- Sleepy -- but the 
fifth-year senior out of Carson has caught much of the Pacific-10 Conference 
napping. 
</P>
<P>
The forward for the Oregon State basketball team has played most of his career 
in the shadow of stars like All-American guard Gary Payton but is quietly 
moving up through the Beavers' record book in many categories. 
</P>
<P>
Against Loyola on Tuesday, the 6-foot-5 Martin had a quiet 16 points, hitting 
seven of 11 shots, to raise his season average to 12.9. That put him within 57 
points of becoming the 23rd player in Oregon State's 1,000-point club. Martin 
is 312 points from breaking into the Beavers' career top 10 scorers. If he 
does, it won't get much mention because Payton -- who scored 48 points Tuesday 
-- will be breaking most school career records. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who played only five games as a freshman due to injury and was awarded 
another year's eligibility, cracked Coach Ralph Miller's starting lineup the 
next season and has averaged 8.8 points on 50.4% shooting since. This season he 
has added the three-pointer to his arsenal. After making only four of 21 
three-point shots in the previous three seasons, Martin has hit 14 of 25 (56%) 
this season, helping explain his increased scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, everything up here is Payton, but I think I've helped the team a 
lot and I'm looking forward to doing more," Martin said. "I checked where I was 
this summer (in career standings) and figured I could get in the top 10." 
</P>
<P>
Martin worked on his three-pointer this summer. He said the coaching changeover 
from Ralph Miller to longtime assistant Jim Anderson has given the players more 
individual leeway. 
</P>
<P>
That game plan didn't include losing to Loyola at Corvallis. "That was a fun 
game to play, but it didn't turn out the way we wanted," Martin said. "We try 
not to lose any games at home. Our goal is always to be undefeated here, so it 
was a letdown." 
</P>
<P>
Martin has long been like a familiar character actor whose name nobody quite 
remembers, even at Carson High where he signed an early letter of intent with 
Oregon State then saw teammate Earl Foreman outshine him. But without doing the 
spectacular, Martin has always been a steady. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's nickname refers to the smallish Beaver team two years ago that was 
known as Miller's Dwarfs. The laid-back Martin, appropriately enough, became 
Sleepy. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm trying to wake up a little bit," Martin joked. "If things go my way, I 
hope to keep on playing (after college)." 
</P>
<P>
That would be no small accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount women's basketball team, which had lost five straight 
games and its outside touch, got back in the groove this week in a 85-71 
victory over visiting Western Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions shot 52% from the field and had the best shooting night of the season 
from guard Kristen Bruich, who hit nine of 17 shots, including five of seven 
from three-point range to ring up 28 points. Her back-court companion, Lynn 
Flanagan, added 20 points on six of 11 accuracy and hit eight of nine free 
throws. The Lions' shooting was augmented by forward Jamie Jesko, who hit four 
of six shots off the bench. The Lions held the visitors to 42.5% shooting, 35% 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The victory raised the Lions' record to 3-5. After taking the Christmas weekend 
off, they take a chilly holiday swing north, playing at Boise State on Thursday 
and Idaho State next Saturday before returning to Gersten Pavilion in January 
for a five-game home stand and the start of conference play. 
</P>
<P>

Marymount games: "I did six of them last year. I've paid my dues" . . . The Cal

CAMARILLO PLAYS POORLY IN 62-59 LOSS TO SCHURR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Any type of Camarillo High loss is sour to Coach John Harbour's taste, but 
Thursday's 62-59 defeat at the hands of Schurr in the championship 
quarterfinals of the Bosco Tech tournament was particularly distasteful. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo (5-2), playing without ailing starters Rick Schnell and Scott Foster, 
struggled behind a 33% shooting effort from the field and what Harbour felt was 
poor defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We were horrible," Harbour said, after a postgame team meeting that lasted 30 
minutes. "I can live with losing, but not the way we did." 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo trailed by as many as seven points in the final quarter but rallied 
behind David Harbour. Harbour, who scored a school-record 50 points Tuesday, 
scored five points in 31 seconds to pull Camarillo within 60-59 with 1:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
After Scott Higa missed the front end of a one-and-one, Camarillo blew an 
opportunity to take the lead when Harbour missed a three-point shot with 48 
seconds left. Schurr's Aaron Kovacs hit both ends of a one-and-one with 22 
seconds left to give Schurr a 62-59 lead, and Harbour missed a 23-foot jump 
shot with 11 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Harbour finished with a game-high 31 points but hit only nine of 28 shots. 
Camarillo was just 17 of 52 from the field and passed the ball around the 
perimeter too much for John Harbour's satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"The other kids can't expect David to do it all," he said. "They're afraid. 
They stand out there and throw the ball around, and nobody will penetrate." 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo missed the scoring and rebounding of Foster, a 6-5 senior forward who 
is out two to six weeks because of mononucleosis. The Scorpions also lost 
Schnell, a 5-10 point guard, for two to four weeks after he underwent an 
emergency appendectomy Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Also, backup center Geoff Gordon was in Michigan visiting family members, which 
left Camarillo with an inexperienced and undermanned team since the Scorpions 
won the Page (Ariz.) tournament last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to get guys to do some things that they've never done," John 
Harbour said. "We were outta whack." 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo will meet Dorsey at 5 p.m. today, the winner playing for fifth place 
Saturday. For his sanity's sake, Harbour hopes a different Camarillo team takes 
the floor. "It's frustrating because I know what we're headed for when we play 
our local teams; they're three times as tough as Schurr," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In another tournament quarterfinal: 
</P>
<P>
Hart 87, Venice 78 -- Hart (6-2) used a strong third quarter to overcome a 
six-point halftime deficit and held on. 
</P>
<P>
Micah Ohlman scored a game-high 34 points, including five three-point baskets, 
and made eight of nine free throws in the fourth quarter to key the comeback. 
Renato Rivas added 22 points for Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Ohlman hit three three-point shots in the fourth quarter, including one with 
four minutes remaining to give the Indians a 77-66 advantage. However, Venice 
(4-6) went on a 6-0 run to pull within five with 2:35 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Ohlman hit eight free throws down the stretch to kill the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Venice led at the half, 45-39, and scored the first basket of the third 
quarter. However, Hart went on a 13-2 run in a three-minute span to take a 
52-49 advantage with 3:44 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas' jump shot with 16 seconds left in the quarter gave Hart a 62-56 lead.

HANCOCK PAIR'S SHARPSHOOTING RIDDLES VALLEY

<P>
Hancock College kept its guards up Thursday night against Valley and the result 
was a tournament championship for the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore guards Ponto Colon and Charlie Lanauze, both of whom hail from Puerto 
Rico, combined for 57 points as Hancock defeated Valley, 107-94, to win the 
eight-team Valley tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Lanauze scored a game-high 32 points and Colon, the most valuable player of the 
tournament, added 25 as Hancock, ranked sixth in the state by the JC Athletic 
Bureau, improved its record to 11-2. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs also defeated Los Angeles City College and Ventura en route to the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran into a buzz saw," Valley Coach Jim Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were at the top of their game. They didn't make any mistakes, and they 
are a good team to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Hancock shot well throughout the game and made 13 three-point field goals en 
route to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Lanauze and Colon contributed eight of those three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
When the Bulldogs weren't hitting from the outside, forward Terry Butler was 
doing damage inside and scoring 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (8-6), which had beaten East L. A. and Pasadena to advance to the final, 
once again had six players score in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Center Cliff Barnes led the Monarchs with 17 points, Andre Harrell added 16 and 
McArthur Wells contributed 15 off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs, however, struggled the entire game in search of offensive 
consistency. 
</P>
<P>
"They had us totally confused on offense," Stephens said. "They matched up on 
defense and they're very quick." 
</P>
<P>
Hancock was ahead, 59-45, at halftime and never let Valley get closer than 12 
points the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Wells brought Valley to within, 80-68, with a three-point basket with 10:55 
left to play, but Butler scored seven points over the next minute and a half to 
put Hancock in front, 91-75. 
</P>
<P>
Lanauze and Colon scored 17 and 16 points, respectively, in the first half and 
kept the pressure on the Monarchs by pushing the ball up the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Hancock led by as many as 16 points in the half, but it was a close game for 
the first 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Wells hit a three-point shot for Valley that brought the Monarchs to within 
28-27 with 9:35 left, but all that did was signal Hancock to step up its 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs, spurred by a pair of three-point baskets by Darrell Black, went 
on a 10-0 run over the next three minutes to go ahead by 11. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not difficult to play at that pace when everyone is playing together," 
said Colon, who was on the floor for all but 45 seconds of the contest. 
</P>
<P>
Harrell, Butler and Leo Parker of Ventura joined Lanauze and Colon on the 
all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
East L.A. 137, L.A. City 115 -- East L.A. made 19 three-point baskets en route 
to winning the consolation championship. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Frank Cardenas led the Huskies with a game-high 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Bell scored 26 points of his 30 points in the second half for East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman Watson led L.A. City with 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura 109, Pasadena 70 -- Ventura had little problem with the Lancers in 
cruising to third place. 
</P>
<P>
Parker led the Pirates with a game-high 28 points and Chris Hantgin scored 22 
-- 12 on four three-point baskets.

DIVIDENDS INCREASE IN LEAPS AND BOUNDS;

<P>
EQUESTRIAN: SISTERS CECE AND LYNDA YOUNGER HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO 
TRAINING AND RIDING CHAMPIONSHIP JUMPERS. THEIR EFFORTS HAVE PAID OFF IN CASH, 
PRIZES AND INTERNATIONAL PRESTIGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two Mercedes 190s are parked outside the stables at Conejo Valley Riding Club. 
They belong to the Younger sisters, CeCe and Lynda, internationally known 
equestrians who jump horses for a living. The $30,000 cars -- one black pearl, 
the other smoke silver -- are reflections of the sport's high-society image, 
but to the sisters, they're illusions. 
</P>
<P>
What's real is the high cost of riding and the low financial returns. The long 
trips and the hard work. The ever-present danger. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do is very stressful," says CeCe, who at 28 is two years older than 
Lynda. "Competition is very stressful. So is all the traveling." Forget about a 
jet-set life style. The Mercedes weren't gifts from Arab sheiks; the sisters 
won them in lieu of prize money. 
</P>
<P>
What's real are the squadrons of flies attacking like dive bombers in a small 
tack room at the riding club. There's nothing glamorous about flies buzzing 
your face. But horses attract flies. Horses also cost a lot to keep. Shipping 
one on a plane from L. A. to New York is $6,000 round trip, and the airlines 
don't even give frequent-flier mileage. 
</P>
<P>
A normal athlete has to worry about taking care of only himself and his 
equipment, maybe shining the irons once in a while. The sisters are "very 
serious athletes," Lynda says, but horses complicate their lives. "Horses are a 
24-hour-a-day job," says CeCe, a petite 4-foot-11 brunette who lives in 
Woodland Hills. "They also last a lot longer than most boyfriends." But who 
wants to compete with a horse for his girlfriend's attention? 
</P>
<P>
Until CeCe became engaged recently, neither sister had time to date. Even when 
they were youngsters in Bakersfield -- competing nationally by their teens -- 
horses had been an all-consuming passion. For most of their teen-age years and 
adulthood, "We had zero to no social life," says Lynda, a 5-2 blonde living in 
Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
And when they're not competing in shows in and out of the country -- the 
American Grandprix Assn. season and international events take up 10 months of 
the year -- the sisters manage to run a full-time business training and selling 
jumpers for their Banner Farm company. They recently moved their base of 
operations from Malibu to the new riding club facilities between Thousand Oaks 
and Simi Valley where they stable 10 horses and soon will be employing a 
full-time groom/caretaker. 
</P>
<P>
It takes six years to train a jumper, but the rewards can be great: 
Olympic-level horses can sell for as much as $1 million. The sisters want the 
business to help support their riding. In their best years, they each collected 
about $85,000 on the AGA show-jumping tour, but the figure includes the price 
of the Mercedes they each received for winning the Mercedes Grand Prix Jumper 
series. 
</P>
<P>
The Youngers are hoping that prize money and corporate sponsorships increase in 
their sport. Show-jumping, according to the AGA, is the second-most popular 
sport in Europe behind soccer and the fastest-growing spectator sport in this 
country. The AGA's first tour in 1978 had 16 events with only $247,000 in prize 
money, but this year $1.7 million has been given out in 31 events. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters say they're lucky because their father -- a Bakersfield trial 
lawyer -- initially helped finance both their riding and horse business. But 
this is the sport of kings. Even lawyers don't make the kind of money it takes 
to launch and sustain a major equestrian campaign. Riders with either a rich 
family or corporate backers historically have ruled grand prix jumping. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the conflict in our sport," CeCe says. "Talent doesn't automatically 
buy you a ticket to the Olympics. A lot of riders can afford to go to Europe 
and buy the best horses." 
</P>
<P>
Horses are fragile creatures, however. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm, the Youngers' black Scottish terrier, snaps his jaws at the flies 
buzzing his head in the tack room, then follows the sisters outside to a corral 
where Lynda's 14-year-old American stallion, The Oregon Kid, stands forlornly. 
Injured for much of the past three years, the Kid has been been receiving 
magnetic-field and ultrasound therapy, acupuncture and even chiropractic 
adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
"We treat our horses like pro athletes," Lynda says. "When they break down, we 
have to repair them. My horse has been a wonderful competitor for 10 years, but 
now the maintenance level is high, like -- I hate saying this -- an old car." 
</P>
<P>
CeCe has had better luck keeping her horse tuned up and running. Poking his 
head out of a stall is Young Fleet, a 13-year-old distant relative of 1943 
Triple Crown winner Count Fleet and "the only grand-prix-jumping quarter-horse 
stallion in the world," CeCe says. 
</P>
<P>
CeCe spots a young horse with his tongue hanging out of his month like a wet 
dishrag. It's Santiago, a Dutch stallion that's her No. 2 horse. "When he 
sticks out his tongue, he wants attention," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the dusty earth, the sisters reach mid-flank on Santiago. They 
certainly don't look big enough or strong enough to be sitting on the back of 
an airborne 1,000-pound beast, but size, they say, no longer is a limiting 
factor. Up until a decade ago, courses were physically demanding for both rider 
and horse. But the horses couldn't take the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Jumping is the only Olympic sport in which men and women compete against each 
other. "Men used to dominate," CeCe says. But then, to keep horses healthy, 
weight requirements were lowered and the courses redesigned, becoming more 
intellectual and technical and opening the way for women to compete with men. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, people wondered how a little girl like myself could handle a 
stallion," Lynda says. "But now, it's finesse that counts." 
</P>
<P>
And the right horse. "You've got to find a horse who's sensitive to women," 
says Lynda, who describes The Oregon Kid as "hot-blooded, sensitive and very 
athletic, a genuine American thoroughbred." 
</P>
<P>
Hard as it is to picture either of the small women atop a horse as it flies 
over a fence, imagine them doing the same thing before they were tall enough to 
ride the Colossus at Magic Mountain. Growing up outside Bakersfield on a 
25-acre farm -- once owned by country singer Buck Owens -- they were jumping at 
age 6. 
</P>
<P>
Their older sister Lisa got them into the sport after seeing a horse movie on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lisa eventually dropped out of competitive riding, CeCe and Lynda did 
practically nothing else but go to school and ride. "It was a hobby that went 
out of control," CeCe says. No proms. No dates. No football games. The sisters 
bought and sold horses even then and took private riding lessons. One of her 
coaches, CeCe says, "just filled my head with dreams of making the Olympic 
team. I was just obsessed." 
</P>
<P>
At 18, CeCe was the youngest member of the U. S. Equestrian Team, but the U. S. 
boycott wiped out any chances she had of going to the 1980 Moscow Olympics. But 
riding still pulled fiercely at the Youngers. They went east to college -- CeCe 
attending Drew University, Lynda going to Richmond -- to get involved in the 
powerful East Coast jumping scene. When their friends were partying or 
studying, the sisters were flying to shows or taking riding lessons from such 
world-renown coaches as George Morris, who has ridden and coached with the U. 
S. team in the Olympics. "I remember them as both being very competitive, 
aggressive and determined," Morris says. 
</P>
<P>
Although CeCe majored in art history and Lynda in political science, they 
decided against careers in their fields and went into riding full time. "We 
both had top horses," Lynda says, referring to Young Fleet and The Oregon Kid. 
Each horse cost the sisters less than $15,000 in the late 1970s but their worth 
has soared to about $500,000 each because in only three years, the Youngers -- 
the only sister team in grand-prix jumping -- consistently have placed among 
the top 10 in AGA events. 
</P>
<P>
Lynda sees the irony. "We've developed this worldwide reputation on our little 
junior jumper horses we've had since childhood," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their seemingly narrow focus, the sisters insist they've led "a 
balanced life," Lynda says. "We ski, go to art museums, have friends. Our 
parents made sure we weren't so consumed by the sport that we'd lose 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Despite accidents -- the Youngers have suffered concussions after falling off 
horses -- there's still nothing like flying over a barricade on the haunches of 
a great animal to get the blood boiling. "It's the same sensation you get 
driving a race car very fast and being on the edge of control," CeCe says. 
</P>
<P>
Lynda admits to being "an adrenalin junkie. Skiing's the only thing that comes 
close to giving me that rush." 
</P>
<P>
After a momentary lull in their schedule this month, the sisters will be back 
to their routine of riding horses six hours a day during the week and traveling 
an average of two weekends a month to shows. At the shows, they'll "compete 
against the course and not each other," CeCe says. 
</P>
<P>
Although they "argue all the time," according to Lynda, their divergent 
personalities mesh. CeCe is more organized, Lynda more people-oriented. "We can 
generally rely on each other," CeCe says. "It's hard to find good reliable 
people in any business." 
</P>
<P>
And in times of stress, they lean on each other. Now that's real.

BRADSHAW GETS HELP; GULLS WIN

<P>
U.S. International University had just finished defeating visiting Eastern 
Washington, 102-93, and Coach Gary Zarecky had a dilemma. He couldn't find a 
single player to hold up as the game's hero. 
</P>
<P>
Which is about the most positive point he could have made. 
</P>
<P>
Too many times this season, Zarecky has been able to point to a single player 
as the key to a victory. And that player was usually Kevin Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
But after the season's most positive victory, names starting rolling off 
Zarecky's tongue like his team rolls up points. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mike Sterner had a great night," Zarecky said. "Steve Smith also had a 
good game and Kevin Bradshaw was a key. And (Demetrius) Laffitte had a solid 
game." 
</P>
<P>
After Zarecky was done with roll call, he tried to put the game in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Monumental," Zarecky said. "I think the players understood -- in our own back 
yard -- it was time to stop talking and grasp onto something. I'm talking about 
how Eastern Washington handled USD. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not taking anything away from USD, we're just pointing to what a quality 
team Eastern Washington is." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles (3-5) defeated USD, 79-64, Tuesday and lost by just five to a solid 
UC Santa Barbara team Saturday. The Gulls, on the other hand, were coming off a 
loss at home to Wright State and eight losses in their past nine games. 
</P>
<P>
But the Gulls pulled together for the first time this season to defeat Eastern 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
And Bradshaw was probably the happiest of the bunch to see it finally happen. 
</P>
<P>
USIU, which was making a habit of looking to Bradshaw, couldn't find the 
high-scoring guard against Wright State. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a promise to the team at practice this week that it wouldn't happen 
again," Bradshaw said. "I told them you would not see that Kevin Bradshaw 
again. I've made my reputation as a scorer, now I need to work on the other 
parts of my game." 
</P>
<P>
And part of his game is to get the other players involved. He did that against 
Eastern Washington. Bradshaw, who is fifth in the country in scoring, hit his 
30-point average but also had eight assists. Bradshaw was 14 of 14 from the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to get the other players involved," Bradshaw said. "It's going to be 
easier on me. I like it that way a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
Laffitte had 20 points and nine rebounds and Smith had 19 points. Sterner added 
11 points and eight rebounds for USIU (4-8). 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Washington looked as if it would make it 2-0 against San Diego teams 
when it jumped to a 5-0 lead. But the Gulls answered. Smith made two free 
throws to give USIU a 29-28 lead and the Gulls never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
USIU led 44-27 at halftime and began to slowly pull away early in the second 
half. The Gulls led 91-79, when Eastern Washington rallied to cut the lead to 
93-85 with 2:50 remaining. Zarecky called a timeout after Bradshaw scored and 
the Gulls went to a half-court game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big victory for us," Zarecky said. "If we can get on a roll, this 
team's going to get better. We have to beat a team like that to start a roll."

NEVADA RENO SHOOTERS ON TARGET, USD'S AREN'T; TOREROS LOSE BY 19

<TEXT>
<P>
Nevada Reno's men's basketball team is not particularly tall. Its lineup ranges 
from 6-feet-10 to 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
It runs a full court press at times, but you wouldn't describe the Wolfpack as 
quick. 
</P>
<P>
Experience? Three underclassmen on the starting five, one senior on the team, 
and its leading scorer, Kevin Franklin (27-point average), is a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
No. These guys are shooters. From the free-throw line, from three-point range, 
from the hip -- they do not miss often. 
</P>
<P>
At least they didn't Thursday night in a 88-69 drubbing of the University of 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
UNR shot 53% (26 of 49) from the field, including 59% (10 of 17) from 
three-point range. It made 77% (26 of 34) from the line, including its first 
15. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Toreros missed almost everything. They missed a breakaway dunk 
attempt late. They missed five shots on one possession, after which Franklin 
took the rebound, dribbled down and pumped in a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
In all, USD missed 49 shots for a dismal 32% (23 of 72) from the field, 
including 18% (two of 11) from three-point range. Its free-throw shooting 
wasn't bad -- 70% (21 of 30) -- but hardly good enough to prevent the loss. 
</P>
<P>
USD fell behind early and never caught up. After a pair of John Jerome free 
throws tied the score, 6-6, UNR scored the next 12 points. Franklin had a pair 
of three-point plays on USD fouls, Ric Herrin had two baskets, and Jon Baer a 
layup. 
</P>
<P>
USD pulled to within 24-16 on baskets by Jerome (two), Kelvin Woods, Wayman 
Strickland and Anthony Thomas. But UNR was off again, eventually taking a 47-31 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
UNR shot 55% (16 of 29) from the field in the half, including 67% (eight of 12) 
from three-point range. UNR did not miss a free throw in seven attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've got a 10-point lead, you can shoot three-pointers with a lot more 
ease and confidence," USD Coach Hank Egan said. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, who led all scorers with 28 points, had 17 by halftime. Matt Williams 
added 18, Kevin Soares 14. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome had 10 of his team-high 18 points in the first half. Anthony Thomas had 
15, Craig Cottrell 11. 
</P>
<P>
UNR controlled the boards, 19-13, in the first half. But USD, thanks in part to 
its many misses, held the second-half advantage, 34-23. 
</P>
<P>
In a game of highlights for UNR, Williams and Soares teamed up for the play of 
the game with 14 minutes left. On an out-of-bounds play near the UNR bench, 
Soares lofted a pass to Williams, who played off a screen, went backdoor and 
made the alley-oop dunk. 
</P>
<P>
The only backdoor USD was thinking about was an escape route out of its Sports 
Center, where the Toreros have dropped two games this week to Big Sky teams. 
</P>
<P>
Talk before this eight-game home stand was of "getting well" after a rough 
five-game road swing left USD 2-5. The Toreros are now 3-7 and looking for 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
UNR, which had not won a road game before Thursday, evened its record at 4-4.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: A MARRIAGE TEST FOR OPPOSITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My fiancee and I love each other very much, but we worry 
because we're so opposite in many ways. I know that opposites attract, but can 
they survive in a long-term relationship? -- G.K. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR G.K.: There are no rigid rules about the necessary ingredients to make a 
marriage last. Spouses who have different temperaments and different interests 
can have happy, successful marriages. These differences may be responsible for 
the stimulation -- the spice -- that keeps the marriage interesting and alive. 
</P>
<P>
If one partner is an introvert and the other an extrovert, if one enjoys sports 
while the other prefers concerts or going to art galleries as a form of 
entertainment and relaxation, this is fine if both are flexible and 
independent. However, if one or both of these spouses tends to be the jealous 
type or if either thinks the only good marriage is one that stresses total 
togetherness, there's going to be trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to guard against trouble is to recognize and discuss your 
different interests and views before you marry. Play let's-pretend games: 
Rehearse how you'd react if each were to spend evenings doing his or her own 
thing. Discuss attitudes about money, raising children, household tasks and 
responsibilities, as well as preferences on holidays and vacations. If such 
discussions produce tension and arguments, you might reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My son and his live-in girlfriend talk about "family." Yet 
I've discovered, much to my regret, that when they speak of family in such 
glowing terms, they're not always talking about relatives, but friends. This 
makes me hurt and angry. Even though my former husband and I may have made a 
lot of mistakes, I feel we're still the only "family" that counts. -- F.F. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR F.F.: Definitions of family have been changing over the years. The closely 
knit, old-fashioned family we used to know has become something of a rarity. I 
see nothing wrong with a larger definition of the word. To me, "family" means 
love and caring. In other words, one can have a family of friends and unrelated 
members. To be "family" it isn't necessary to be a blood relation or an in-law. 
</P>
<P>
The old-fashioned concept of family as you know it is far from dead, however. 
In a recent study of family and family values, Dr. Albert Solnit of the Child 
Study Center at Yale University reported that people cherish the family, even 
when their experience has been less than perfect. 
</P>
<P>
By 3 to 1, those surveyed defined family as a group that loves and cares for 
each other. Perhaps your son includes you and his father in this group.

DIABETIC IS PUSHING 80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dr. Neil Solomon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: If someone who is pushing age 80 is told for the first time in his 
life that he has diabetes, does it make any sense for him to change the way 
he's been living? I think I'm better shape than my doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The question isn't whether you're in better shape than your doctor, but 
whether you are in as good shape as you can possibly be. Measuring your health 
against that of your physician serves no useful purpose. 
</P>
<P>
If you're pushing 80, you must have been doing something right all these years. 
My guess would be that any changes your physician would recommend in the way 
you live would be relatively minor. Moreover, any changes required because of 
diabetes would probably also reduce risk of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Can a woman have more than one Caesarean delivery? I've already had 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A definitive answer, of course, depends on the individual case. In 
general, however, there is no absolute limit on the number of Caesarean births 
a woman may have. 
</P>
<P>
For Morton, Wilmington, Del.: The onset of flu is more sudden, and the symptoms 
are more severe, than with a cold.

JAZZ FANS ON LIST? LOOK NO FURTHER; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: SAN DIEGO IS HOME TO SOME TOP JAZZ TALENT, AND A LARGE SELECTION OF 
QUALITY MUSIC IS AVAILABLE FOR HOLIDAY GIFTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Want to give the gift of jazz to your favorite music buff? 
</P>
<P>
You can walk the aisles of your major chain music store and fill your basket 
with the obvious big-name albums. 
</P>
<P>
Or you can take another approach: Why not turn your musical friend onto one or 
two of the many recordings made by San Diego musicians? 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's jazz scene is so low-key, most people aren't aware how much top 
talent is here. Yet those who follow it can vouch for the large quantity of 
recorded music -- excellent music -- available. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say there are at least 3 dozen albums," said Paul Lavoie, host of "San 
Diego Spotlight," the Sunday night local jazz program on KIFM (98.1). Lavoie's 
tastes run toward lighter, commercial jazz, but there are even more albums 
available by mainstream players. 
</P>
<P>
Jude Hibler, publisher of The Jazz Link, a monthly San Diego jazz journal, came 
up with a list of 77 musicians who have either recorded their own albums or 
played on sessions with other musicians. 
</P>
<P>
With the recent migration to San Diego by such top jazz players as sax man 
James Moody and guitarists Mundell Lowe and Barney Kessel, the list of recorded 
local talent grew even more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
The Tower Records on Sports 
</P>
<P>
Arena Boulevard is the place most often mentioned by local musicians as a 
source of their recorded music. Folk Arts Rare Records on Adams Avenue in San 
Diego stocks several hard-to-find albums by local players. 
</P>
<P>
Here, then, are some jazzy picks for your Christmas shopping list: 
</P>
<P>
* No lover of jazz saxophonists dating back to Lester Young, Charlie Parker or 
Coleman Hawkins should be without an album by Moody. His newest is titled 
"Sweet and Lovely." 
</P>
<P>
Moody, 64, is a survivor. He's played with the greats, and lived to assimilate 
their influences. Today, Moody's mood is buoyant, his playing at times melodic, 
witty, fiery. Old pal Dizzy Gillespie joins him for two tunes on the new album. 
</P>
<P>
* Another survivor is La Jolla saxophonist Charles McPherson, a sax master in 
his own right who has made several albums. Most recently, he played Parker's 
sax parts on the sound track for "Bird," the movie about the life of Parker. 
</P>
<P>
* Mike Wofford is one of San Diego's top jazz pianists. He is featured on Ella 
Fitzgerald's new album, due for release early next year, and he's done a number 
of notable projects of his own. One of his most critically acclaimed sessions 
is this year's "Gerald's People," on which Wofford tackles the music of veteran 
composer, band leader and trumpeter Gerald Wilson, with Rufus Reid on bass and 
Carl Burnett on drums. 
</P>
<P>
* Bassist Bob Magnusson, who often plays with Wofford, has several albums of 
his own, including the 3-year-old "Song for Janet Lee" with Hubert Laws, Bobby 
Shew, Peter Sprague and Billy Mintz, and earlier collaborations with such 
talents as Bill Mays, John Guerin and Hubert Laws. 
</P>
<P>
* Saxophonists Joe Marillo and Tony Ortega have both recorded albums over the 
years. Ortega's work ranges from the avant garde 1965 "Revelation" to the more 
mainstream 1979 "Rain Dance," including Ortega's wife Mona Orbeck on vibes. 
Neither has recorded recently, but a little sleuthing is bound to turn up the 
existing albums. 
</P>
<P>
* Paul Sundfor, the local alto sax man, is revered by local players. He has no 
albums as a leader, but he played on Wofford's 1987 "Funkallero" and also joins 
bassist Andy Simpkins on an album due in January. 
</P>
<P>
* Guitarist Peter Sprague has recorded several albums; one of the most 
satisfying was last year's "Na Pali Coast," featuring Sprague with the fine Los 
Angeles flutist Steve Kujala. Sprague and Kujala hooked up to create lilting, 
tropical melodies that do justice to the album's title, a reference to an area 
in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
* A pair of San Diego flutists also issued albums last year. Lori Bell's "Take 
Me To Brazil," a collaboration with pianist Dave Mackay, finds the pair putting 
their energy into melodic music, often anchored by Latin rhythms. Holly Hofmann 
recorded "Take Note" with Wofford on piano, Sherman Ferguson on drums and Bob 
Magnusson on bass. 
</P>
<P>
* In the realm of bluesy jazz are Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham, whose 1989 album 
"Back to the 'Hood," recorded with their Sweet Baby Blues Band, received raves 
from jazz critics across the country. 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego's avant-garde jazz scene is nearly invisible, but it does exist. 
Perhaps the most prolific of the cutting-edge local players is pianist Glenn 
Horiuchi, who, in the space of less than three years, has recorded three fine 
albums for the tiny Bay Area-based Asian Improv label. 
</P>
<P>
Horiuchi brings the frenetic energy of pianist Cecil Taylor to his roots in 
traditional Chinese music. 
</P>
<P>
* Also in the realm of cutting-edge jazz is the technically awesome San Diego 
pianist Harry Pickens, who can be heard on several Blue Note albums with the 
group Out of the Blue. 
</P>
<P>
* At the other end of the spectrum are several San Diego artists who have made 
it big with a lighter, commercial radio-oriented brand of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most impressive debuts was this year's "Architects of Change," by 
composer and keyboard wiz Spencer Nilsen. Instead of the soporific elevator 
jazz that often gets commercial play, Nilsen has built a complex wall of sound 
anchored by relentless pulsing rhythms over which he lays his powerful, 
synthesized melody lines. 
</P>
<P>
* Checkfield, a studio duo consisting of John Archer and Ron Satterfield 
(Archer "discovered" Nilsen) came out with "Through the Lens" last year, the 
band's third album. It doesn't have as much raw spunk as Nilsen's album, but as 
polished, multitracked studio projects go, this one is state of the art. 
</P>
<P>
Other local light jazz leaders are Neon, featuring Hollis Gentry, and 
Fattburger. Albums by both bands this year sold well and made it onto radio 
play lists across the country. The Mark Lessman Band and Flight 7 also released 
light jazz albums in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego also has its share of golden era jazz men, players with experience 
dating back to the big band days. 
</P>
<P>
Band leader Bob Crosby lives in La Jolla. Though he didn't play an instrument 
or read or write music, Crosby fronted a group of top musicians who defected 
from leader Ben Pollack in the '30s. With Crosby, they recorded several albums 
in the '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby bassist Bob Haggart, of La Costa, has made several albums with trumpeter 
Yank Lawson in The World's Greatest Jazz Band. They are available by mail 
(Audiophile Records, 1206 Decatur St., New Orleans 70116). 
</P>
<P>
During the years when Haggart was working with Crosby, San Diego trumpeter John 
Best was playing and recording with the big bands of Les Brown, Artie Shaw, 
Glenn Miller and others, and many of these albums can still be found. 
</P>
<P>
Several other names belong on this list, though there isn't room to discuss 
their work in detail: singer Frankie Laine, saxophonist Gary Lefebvre, singer 
Kevyn Lettau (with Sergio Mendes and Sprague), guitarist (and Padre pitcher) 
Eric Show, the South Market Street Band (Dixieland; buy their tapes at live 
dates); Art Resnick; Nelson Riddle Jr.; the San Diego State University Jazz 
Ensemble; clarinetist Bobby Gordon, Fro Brigham and many others.

THE GALLERIES: VENICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENA DONOHUE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Idaho-based painter and teacher Rome Stuckart paints tree littered forest 
knolls using robust, mahogany tinged hues and an abbreviated, visionary 
realism. The artist studied abroad and you can see traces of academic training 
and European landscape savvy in the works. In Stuckart's hands, the genre 
acquires the formal eccentricities of Surrealism and a twist of 20th-Century 
Angst. 
</P>
<P>
 Colors are not exactly natural, they're exaggerated or invented, as in the 
rainbow veneer she gives the bark of fallen branches, or the inexplicable blue 
shadows that give foliage a threatening bite. The artist keeps her colors very 
warm, mixing them with lots of red and orange to make scenes vibrate with 
energy. Her arrangement of space is believable enough to pass for naturalism, 
but closer consideration reveals the artist's selective imagination at work. 
The pictorial space she frames is narrow and somewhat claustrophobic. 
</P>
<P>
In "Dry Creek Basin," the twigs of a bare tree trunk plunked in the foreground 
block our entry point like weapons or sentinels, and in "Bone Yard" a tree 
leveled to a jagged stump by some violent force is about as cozy as a bed of 
glass shards. In just about every work, tangled boughs, dark pools, and 
boulders suggest inanimate nature about to come to life. Just beyond this 
barrier of seductive, yet off-putting nature we spy an intense, inviting glow. 
It's almost too obvious that these aren't literal landscapes but metaphors for 
life's sublime yet rocky course. (Market Street Gallery, 48 Market St., to Jan.

Known as the Zhou Brothers, Shan Zuo and Da Huang Zhoushi are young emigres 
from the People's Republic of China, members of the first generation of their 
countrymen to work in abstract styles based on Western models. They collaborate 
on large and lumbering mixed-media paintings -- some in columnar formats -- 
that look dutifully schooled in the art of Miro and Dubuffet as well as the 
prehistoric cliff paintings of Guangxi Province. Silhouettes of "primitive" 
figures and beasts, thin red lines and small markings meander over lumpy 
surfaces of buckling fabric. The artists' attempt at creating a weathered, 
"ancient" effect is thwarted by a cacophony of special effects, including 
metallic paints and passages that seem to have been textured with metal 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller paintings are somewhat more streamlined, though they still get 
zapped by ludicrously inappropriate swaths of metallic paint. A horned animal 
and a harp-like form hanging from the central tree in "Tree of Life" have a 
sprightly, piquant aspect. With more pruning of extraneous elements, the 
fanciful side of the Zhou Brothers' vision might have some room to breathe.

L.A. artist Matthew Thomas paints flat, matte rectangles in the neutral tones 
of geometric abstraction and then selectively textures surfaces with materials 
like mud, clay, poured wax and sand added to acrylic paint. In "Essential 
Ground," two panels abut to make a vertical abstract color field composition. 
The upper, rust-toned panel has a gritty finish that looks like the earth's 
ridged and bumpy topography seen from a great distance. In the lower panel, 
Thomas uses what looks like blanched clay that's been mixed with paint, applied 
in varying thicknesses and then allowed to dry and crack to create the 
appearance of a parched riverbed viewed at very close range. 
</P>
<P>
In the three paneled piece, "Plane Landscape," an uninflected black field 
implies some vast cosmic space with the help of diagrammatic lines of the sort 
used by astronomers to chart the heavens. The neighboring panel in neutral 
beige has the faintest suggestion of pitted ridging and calls up an aerial view 
of an arid valley. The final panel uses ground-up, then painted-on porcelain 
clay to reproduce the brittle surface of a cracked stoneware artifact or a 
fragment of desert architecture fissured by time. (Ultima Gallery, 2105 Main

HOME TECH: OFFBEAT FILMS OFFER PLENTY OF SEASONAL CHEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Offbeat, fairly obscure Christmas movies can provide the warm, seasonal cheer 
you're looking for in a holiday-oriented film -- as much as you'll find in 
chestnuts such as "Holiday Inn" and "White Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
But when you're confronted with shelves full of holiday movies at your local 
video store, it's hard to figure out which ones will provide heavy doses of 
cheer and which won't. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a guide that may help you make your selections: 
</P>
<P>
* "Holiday Affair" (Turner Entertainment, 1949). In the late '40s, there were 
many movies about the plight of war widows. This small movie, one of the good 
ones in that genre, works as heart-warming holiday entertainment. Janet Leigh 
plays an impoverished widow with a young son who's anxious to get a set of 
trains for Christmas. Meanwhile, his mother is being courted by two handsome 
suitors (Robert Mitchum and Wendell Corey). Predictable, not too sentimental 
and basically well-made. 
</P>
<P>
* "One Magic Christmas" (Disney, 1985). If you can buy gruff Harry Dean Stanton 
as a guardian angel, you'll like this tale of a mother (Mary Steenburgen) who's 
weighed down by so many problems she can't generate any Christmas spirit. But 
the angel and her 6-year-old daughter figure out a way to pump her full of 
holiday cheer. In the meantime, you'll be infused with a healthy dose of cheer 
too. Good, often overlooked holiday movie. 
</P>
<P>
* "Christmas in Connecticut" (MGM/UA, 1945). This one belongs with the best in 
the Christmas-movie genre. It's a merry romantic comedy concerning a magazine 
columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) who writes about food, farm life and family, 
though blithely ignorant of all three. To salvage her job, she has to 
orchestrate a homey Christmas in Connecticut for her boss (Sydney Greenstreet) 
and a war veteran (Dennis Morgan). You'll be flooded with seasonal cheer as you 
watch the columnist and the veteran warm up to each other. 
</P>
<P>
* "Christmas Lilies of the Field" (MPI, 1979). In this sequel, Billy Dee 
Williams plays amiable drifter Homer Smith -- a role made famous by Sidney 
Poitier in the 1963 original. In the original, nuns coaxed Homer into building 
a chapel in the Arizona desert. This time, the nuns need an orphanage and a 
kindergarten. Homer, naturally, drifts in at the right time. This one is so 
full of sentiment and holiday spirit, you may OD on both. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Christmas Wife" (HBO, 1988). Jason Roberts plays a lonely widower who 
goes to an agency to hire a woman to be his Christmas companion in a mountain 
retreat. He hooks up with shy Iris (Julie Harris), who has an interesting 
secret. Watching this low-key character study, which was made-for-cable, you'll 
marvel at the skills of the stars. This is as good and touching as anything in 
the Christmas-movie genre. 
</P>
<P>
* "Dot and Santa Claus" (CBS-Fox, 1979). A mixture of animation and live 
action, this is the fast-moving tale of a little girl who goes globe-trotting 
with Santa in search of her lost baby kangaroo. Mostly for youngsters, but 
adults will find it charming and loaded with holiday cheer. 
</P>
<P>
* "Ernest Saves Christmas"(Touchstone, 1988). If you're over 10, you may not be 
able to stomach Ernest P. Worrell (Jim Varney), the good-hearted goof who seems 
to have the mind of a 10-year-old. But it's easy to see what kids see in him. 
He's the grown-up who's also on their level. This time our child-like hero 
comes to the rescue when Santa runs into a series of problems that keep him 
from doing his duty. If you can somehow keep Ernest from getting on your 
nerves, you'll come away from this one with nice holiday glow. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" -- the heart-warming tale of the 
transformation of a nasty old grump into a warm, charitable guy during the 
holidays -- is as much a part of this season as Christmas trees and turkey. But 
there are so many versions available on video that choosing one isn't easy. 
Here's a guide to the most prominent ones: 
</P>
<P>
* "A Christmas Carol" (United Home Video, 1951). If you're really fussy about 
Dickens and you want a version reasonably faithful to the original, this should 
be your choice. Scrooge is usually portrayed as a one-dimensional old miser, a 
flat, cardboard cutout who's mean for the fun of it. But Alistair Sims manages 
to flesh out the character. You get some hints about why he's such an unsavory 
human being. An excellent drama, but a bit on the dark, moody side. 
</P>
<P>
* "A Christmas Carol" (MGM/UA, 1938). If you can't find the version starring 
Alistair Sim, this one will do. Reginald Owen's Scrooge isn't as multilayered 
as Sim's, but as heart-warming holiday entertainment, the 1938 version is 
superior to the 1951 film. 
</P>
<P>
* "Scrooged" (1988, Paramount). In this hip, somewhat dark-toned contemporary 
version, smirking Bill Murray stars as the nasty TV executive who shapes up 
after the three ghosts force him to see what a louse he's become. Fairly funny 
but not particularly full of holiday cheer. 
</P>
<P>
* "Scrooge" (CBS-Fox, 1970). "A Christmas Carol" as a musical, with Albert 
Finney amiably over-acting in the title role. The Leslie Bricusse score isn't 
memorable, but Alec Guiness is as Marley's ghost. A solid holiday 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
* "Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol" (Paramount, 1962). An animated musical version 
-- catchy score by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill -- of Dickens' tale with 
near-sighted Mr. Magoo (the voice of Jim Backus) as Scrooge. This one is also 
strangely dark-toned, with Magoo playing an actor who's starring in a 
theatrical production of Scrooge. More serious than you'd expect but ultimately 
good fun. 
</P>
<P>
If you're in a humbug mood, here are some movies that will snap you out of it: 
</P>
<P>
* "Silent Night, Deadly Night" (IVE, 1984). In this slash-and-splatter flick, 
Santa is an ax-murderer. This movie is gleefully perverse -- and very gory. 
</P>
<P>
* "Black Christmas" (Warner, 1975). Starring John Saxon and Margot Kidder, this 
is a bone-chilling tale about a maniac who's holed up in the attic of a college 
sorority house during Christmas vacation, killing off the co-eds. 
</P>
<P>
After watching these two, you'll be so down that you'll want to recuperate by 
immersing yourself in Christmas cheer.

ANN CONWAY: FAMILY IS THE KEY TO CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Ann Conway

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Material things don't matter. It's happiness and tranquility in the family 
that count." 
</P>
<P>
A surprising holiday sentiment from someone who holes up on Linda Isle, deep in 
the heart of nouveau riche country? 
</P>
<P>
Not if you're Dee Wambaugh, wife of author Joseph Wambaugh, best-selling author 
of such books as "The Onion Field" and the soon-to-be-published "The Golden 
Orange," a cop thriller played out in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Dee kicks up her social heels with the best of them, happily tipping 
bubbly here, diving into caviar there, dressed to kill everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
But, like many of the stars who regularly shine on the local scene, Dee knows 
that the bottom line for happiness is family. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: She and her pen-wielding hubby are hitting the road for the 
holidays, leaving glittery Newport Bay for the desert, where she'll cook up a 
turkey on Christmas Eve with son David, 25, daughter Jeannette, 21, and 
grandparents Emma and Frank Hendricks ("Can you believe someone my age is lucky 
enough to have grandparents?"). 
</P>
<P>
She says it again: "It's happiness and tranquility in the family that count. 
I'm hoping for some the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
So is Gep Durenberger. The effervescent director of the Center for the Study of 
Decorative Arts in San Juan Capistrano, site of many a sophisticated splash, is 
heading for his old homestead in Le Sueur, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
The house where Durenberger was born was built in 1859, the same year the house 
belonging to the famous Mayo family of Minnesota was built. "It sits on a 
hill," he says. "And, of course, an old-fashioned Christmas tree sits in a huge 
bay window, covered with old-fashioned ornaments." 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger, a pal of such social front-runners as television producer Norman 
Lear and internationally acclaimed interior designer John Saladino, will open 
his favorite front door on New Year's Day for a familial love-in. "My cousins 
will come, and we'll dine on old-fashioned cooking -- baked apples, bread 
pudding, that kind of thing. It's wonderful. I get renewed and come home with 
both feet on the ground, ready to do battle." 
</P>
<P>
Even the bustling Amen Wardy, owner of the thriving boutique in Newport Beach 
that is patronized by such glitz-loving luminaries as Jackie Collins, is 
leaving it all behind for the holidays. "I'm on my way to my house in 
Montecito," says Wardy, who turned a car garage into a mirrored a la Versailles 
boutique and made millions. And he'll do the cooking for Christmas Eve, which 
he will enjoy with his beautiful daughter, Soffia. On the menu? "I don't know 
yet. I don't decide until I go to the store!" 
</P>
<P>
Social heavyweights Al Baldwin and his wife, Deeann, are heading to their ranch 
in Wyoming, returning to their Emerald Bay home for Christmas and then zipping 
to Wyoming again. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the zig-zag, Deeann says, is "parental pressure." 
</P>
<P>
"Mine and Al's parents want to see us and our four children on Christmas, and 
we want to see them." 
</P>
<P>
But, Deeann admits, she prefers Wyoming for family holiday celebrations. "My 
Emerald Bay tree is beautiful, but it's really a designer tree. 
</P>
<P>
"In Wyoming, I take a tree and throw all the ornaments on it I can find. And I 
pop popcorn, make apple pie and settle down with Al and the kids to play board 
games. There's no television, so the kids have to talk to us. And there's no 
phone, so the kids don't get any calls! It's heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Heiress Joan Irvine Smith, who stages Orange County's most lavish brunch when 
she tosses her Oaks Classic horse-jumping event each spring, will spend 
Christmas Day in her San Juan Capistrano ranch house with her mum, Athalie 
Clarke, and a slew of relatives. Everybody helps with the cooking, says Clarke, 
who is proud as punch of the guest list since it will include her 
grandchildren, Lt. Commander Russell Penniman, a graduate of Annapolis ("one of 
the best pilots the Navy has," she says); James Swinden, and Morton Irvine 
Smith. "And a new great grandson, Russell Penniman V," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 6-month-old will be on the scene, Joan and Athalie have decided to 
make it a "children's Christmas" celebration, Athalie says. "Little Russell 
will get a rocking horse, and Joan is putting miniature horses all over the 
tree." 
</P>
<P>
There will be eggnog, turkey and plum pudding, Clarke says. "What's more fun 
than dining with family?" 
</P>
<P>
As for yours truly, someone who hits an average of 120 bashes sans family per 
year, well, it's time to toss a party. A family party, of course. On Christmas 
Eve, I'll set out the champagne (something you learn to love when you're a 
society writer) and my husband, Bob, and I will toast our blessings with our 
five children: Robert, Michelle, Christa, Rick and Michael. 
</P>
<P>
Then we'll head into the dining room for a sit-down dinner where I'll serve 
lobster that Bob has prepared (dining on something someone else has prepared is 
another thing you learn to love when you're a society writer) and drive 
everyone nuts when I ask the same old question: "What are you most thankful for 
this Christmas?" 
</P>
<P>
High on my list will be the fact that I've gotten to know so many 
family-oriented social types in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
They know the bottom line. And I do too.

County residents are the most litigious in the state, at least in terms of 
automobile accidents. Although more than three times as many such suits were 
filed in Los Angeles County, the Orange County mark of 485.57 suits filed per 
100,000 residents is the highest in the state. By comparison, the lowest rate 
among the 58 counties was 37.04 in Calaveras. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County ranked second last year, with a per 100,000 resident rate of 
484.13 while Los Angeles County had the highest rate, 506.90. But an 8.58 
decrease in suits in Los Angeles County between this year and last helped move 
Orange County into the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at how we compare to the four contiguous counties as well as the 
state, this year and last:

MOURNING DOVE 
</P>
<P>
(Zenaida macroura) 
</P>
<P>
Description: Trim-bodied with long tail tapering to a point. Black spots on 
upperwing; pinkish wash on underparts. In flight, shows white tips on outer 
tail feathers. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Desert (near water) to open woodland, agricultural areas with 
scattered trees, suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Seeds, including waste grain from cultivated fields. Young are milk-fed 
for three days, then also seeds; entirely seeds by six to eight days. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Courtship; male performs gliding, spiraling aerial display over 
female with wingtips held below body. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: In fork of horizontal tree branch, on ground, in deserted nests of other 
species, or anywhere else providing solid support. Construction is flimsy, 
usually of crossed sticks and twigs (occasionally grass, weed stems) lined with 
fine materials. Female builds, but male brings materials. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: White, unmarked and always covered; 1-inch long. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: Champion of multiple-brooding among North American birds 
-- also most abundant doves in North America and most widely hunted and 
harvested game bird. Males may bow repeatedly and then lift heads and coo when 
defending territories. The male incubates eggs most of the day, female 
remainder of day. Males produce milk four to six days longer than females. 
Wings produce a fluttering whistle as the bird takes flight. Doves' call is a 
mournful oowoo-woo-woo-woo.

A three-judge panel in Richmond, Va., certified the election to governor of 
Democrat L. Douglas Wilder in a recount that gave him a 6,741-vote margin over 
Republican J. Marshall Coleman. The recount confirmed Wilder as the first black 
elected governor in history, with 896,936 votes to 890,195 for Coleman, who 
picked up 113 votes in the recount. The first count of the Nov. 7 election gave 
Wilder victory by 6,854 votes, or four-tenths of 1% of the 1.78 million votes 
cast. Under state law, that margin was close enough for Coleman to get a 
recount at state expense. William H. Hurd, Coleman's attorney, said the 
Republican would not challenge the judges' decision in the General Assembly.

The measles explosion of 1989, involving unvaccinated preschoolers and 
schoolchildren whose shots didn't work, has been accompanied by the most 
measles deaths in 18 years, federal health officials said. Forty-two deaths 
from measles have been reported this year, the Atlanta-based Centers for 
Disease Control said. That's the largest death count since 90 in 1971, a CDC 
spokesman noted. Nationwide, 14,714 measles cases were counted with two weeks 
left in the year, the CDC reported. That's more than five times the 2,876 cases 
reported at this point a year ago. Large measles outbreaks are continuing in 
Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston, primarily among young blacks and Latinos, the 
CDC noted.

Leslie Van Houten, one of Charles Manson's "girls" convicted in the savage 
Tate-La Bianca murders 20 years ago, was denied parole for the eighth time at a 
hearing at the California Institution for Women at Frontera. A three-member 
Board of Prison Terms panel found the 40-year-old former beauty queen 
unsuitable for release because of her crime, her "unstable social history" and 
her need for further alcohol and drug rehabilitation. Van Houten was convicted 
of participating in the August, 1969, murders of grocery executive Leno La 
Bianca and his wife, Rosemary. The La Biancas were the sixth and seventh 
victims in two nights of murder, including actress Sharon Tate, who was more 
than eight months pregnant.

MORE DATA NEEDED ON PIER, AGENCY SAYS

State fisheries agencies have thrown a curve at the Tahoe Regional Planning 
Agency by saying there is still not enough data to justify an easing of rules 
on Lake Tahoe pier construction. The comments from California and Nevada state 
biologists followed release of a $240,000 agency-sponsored study which 
concludes that piers do not seem to have a detrimental impact on Lake Tahoe's 
fish. The biologists said that because the 16-month study took place while the 
lake was at a low level, more research is needed to study habitats that were 
dry during the drought. A draft ordinance change would allow piers to be 
constructed in areas mapped as fish habitat during summer months. Currently, no 
piers can be built in such areas, which cover 80% to 90% of the lake's 
shoreline. Consultant Dena Schwarte, who represents many shoreline property 
owners, said she was disappointed with the biologists' comments.

HUBIE BROOKS JOINS THE CROWD IN L.A. OUTFIELD; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FREE AGENT LEAVES THE MONTREAL EXPOS AND SIGNS A $6-MILLION, 
THREE-YEAR CONTRACT WITH DODGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again demonstrating an apparent belief that the best defense against 
criticism is confusion, the Dodgers continued their unusual reshaping of a 
fourth-place team Thursday with the signing of Hubie Brooks, Montreal's 
free-agent outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, 33, was immediately anointed the right fielder, which is fine, except 
that just Wednesday, Kirk Gibson had been anointed the right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
"C'mon," Dodger Vice President Fred Claire said with some astonishment. "If 
Kirk Gibson is healthy, he will be in the lineup." 
</P>
<P>
That means Gibson, recovering from knee surgery, will play left field. That 
should be interesting news for Kal Daniels, who is reportedly rehabilitating 
his left knee so he can be the Dodgers' left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody, but nobody, can say if both Kal and Kirk are going to be 100% by the 
start of the season," Claire said. "If they are, a lot of good things will 
happen to this team. But if they aren't, well, we have to take that into 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Brooks will make $6 million over three years, it figures that 
he will play somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
What about the former shortstop moving to, say, third base? 
</P>
<P>
"Don't the Dodgers already have a third baseman?" Brooks asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Claire confirmed. "Jeff Hamilton is our third baseman. Hubie is our 
right fielder." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," Brooks said, "if need be, we'll find out about third base." 
</P>
<P>
"Right fielder," Claire repeated. "He came here to play every day in right 
field." 
</P>
<P>
Pause. 
</P>
<P>
"For now." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the position, Brooks is pleased to be leaving Canada and returning to 
where he once starred for Dominguez High in Compton. He left here 12 years ago 
as a first-round pick of the New York Mets from Arizona State. He returns as 
one of baseball's top RBI men who, like other recent Dodger acquisitions, is 
recovering from a stumble. 
</P>
<P>
Last season he was sporadically platooned in right field and wound up hitting 
.268 with 14 home runs and 70 runs batted in in 148 games. That RBI total was 
his second lowest in six seasons, and his homer total matched his second lowest 
during that time. It left him longing for home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to be getting back to Los Angeles," Brooks said. "I could not ask for 
much more." 
</P>
<P>
And like many, he was surprised that the Dodgers had called. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think this club had much room for me," he said. "I thought the 
Dodgers were done doing things." 
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's trade that brought center fielder Juan Samuel from the New 
York Mets for outfielder Mike Marshall and reliever Alejandro Pena, most 
everybody thought that. At the time, even Claire had said, "All we will 
probably do now is work on refining what we have." 
</P>
<P>
But Claire had been eyeing Brooks for Marshall's potentially vacant spot since 
the winter meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Once Marshall was traded, Claire contacted Brooks' agent, Richie Bry, on 
Wednesday night. And things happened fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Real fast," Brooks said. "My agent called and said that Fred Claire had 
contacted him. Then my agent called back and said I had signed." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers were competing with Atlanta, Boston and Toronto. That was the 
reason for the three-year deal and at least the promise to start Brooks in 
right field. 
</P>
<P>
Said Claire: "We had to give him that length of a deal to get him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Brooks, who was moved to the outfield from the infield two years ago: "And 
the Dodgers told me I could play right field, where some other teams maybe were 
talking about moving me. I would like to stay in right field. You don't know 
how hard it is to change positions in the major leagues. Believe me, I know, 
and I'm not ready to change again." 
</P>
<P>
One team conspicuously absent from the bidding was the Expos. Manager Buck 
Rodgers said it was because the Expos believed Brooks did not want to return. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks agreed, but said it was only because the Expos had not shown much 
confidence in him during last season's slump. He said they should have stuck 
longer with a player who as recently as 1988 hit .279 with 20 homers and 90 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt after last year, they didn't have a whole lot of confidence in what I 
could do," Brooks said. "I like to go somewhere that they will show me a little 
confidence, even when I reach a low point. Some place where they know what I am 
capable of." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Rodgers, when contacted at his home in Orange County, had nothing but 
praise for Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a good man," he said. "I always thought he was one of the better 
hitters in the league, and I still feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I benched him for five or six games last year, but it really got him 
going, and he finished the year strong. Sure, he was mad when I benched him, 
but anybody would be mad. I didn't lose confidence in him." 
</P>
<P>
Now for the big question. Where can Brooks play. 
</P>
<P>
"He has aged a little, but I see him still playing well in the outfield for the 
next two or three years," Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
Third base? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, he can still play third base," Rodgers said. "I don't see why not." 
</P>
<P>
Said Brooks: "I took grounders at third base last spring . . . but let's just 
wait and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks' contract calls for a $950,000 signing bonus, $1.05 million next season 
and $2 million in each of the following years. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a no-trade clause that prevents the Dodgers from sending Brooks 
back to Montreal or to any American League team other than the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
He is the fourth free agent to leave the Expos in the off-season. Earlier, 
pitchers Mark Langston, Bryn Smith and Pascual Perez chose not to re-sign with 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers made another strange addition late Thursday, signing injured 
Philadelphia free-agent pitcher Mike Maddux to a non-guaranteed contract. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux, who underwent surgery to remove bone chips from his right elbow in 
September, was 1-3 with a 5.15 earned-run average in 16 games in 1989. That was 
his first full season in the major leagues, and featured two complete games, 
including a two-hit, 8-0 shutout over Cincinnati April 29. Maddux, 28, is not 
expected to compete for a spot in the Dodgers' league-best rotation. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers originally attempted to sign him to a minor league contract and 
send him to triple-A Albuquerque but, because of competition from other teams, 
they were forced to give him a contract with split salaries for time spent in 
the major and minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Maddux is the older brother of Chicago Cubs pitcher Greg Maddux.

BABE RUTH: DEAD 41 YEARS, HE LIVES ON IN ENDORSEMENTS THAT BRING HEIRS HUNDREDS 
OF THOUSANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SANDOMIR, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine the potential Babe Ruth would have in today's 
every-athlete-has-a-sneaker-deal endorsement market. 
</P>
<P>
He could rival Bo Jackson -- "Babe knows baseball. . . . Babe knows hot dogs" 
-- hawk Hertz with Arnie and O. J., look lumpy in his Hanes with Boomer 
Esiason, pitch Slimfast diets with Lasorda and take sides in the Miller Lite 
"Less filling! Tastes Great!" debate. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Ruth is not doing shabbily. Forty-one years after his death, Ruth's 
name and visage are licensed to more than 100 companies and products -- banks, 
car companies, retailers, trading card firms, teddy bears, and a maker of 
trapping knives -- avidly trying to profit from his powerful, mythic and 
mischievous appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The Bambino is earning wealth for his heirs that, given his own commercial 
bent, surely wouldn't have surprised the man who did not break stride when told 
his $80,000 salary exceeded President Hoover's. 
</P>
<P>
In an era in which celebrity worship is at its height, stars such as the Babe 
cannot commit the ultimate no-no of endorsement deals: getting in trouble. 
Though the Babe was known to imbibe, smoke and carouse, his conduct is now 
impeccable. Through the selective filter of hero worship, the Babe's image is 
as clean as Orel Hershiser's. 
</P>
<P>
Add to that trend the expanding market for baseball memorabilia, and it's easy 
to see why the most popular player in the sport's history remains its most 
durable commercial symbol. 
</P>
<P>
So, whether he endorses IBM personal computers, sneakers, free checking for 
senior citizens at a Philadelphia bank, Zenith power supplies or the 
Hewlett-Packard sales force, Babe Ruth stands for whatever the paying company 
desires. 
</P>
<P>
"The legend of Babe Ruth is a very tangible thing," said Mark Roesler, 
president of Curtis Management Group, the Babe's Indianapolis-based licensing 
agent. "Babe's image as the ultimate power hitter, the ultimate superstar isn't 
going to change. (Roger) Maris hit 61 homers, but the Babe's image will never 
change. He's achieved his place in history. Current players have not." 
</P>
<P>
Roesler said that fees paid to the Ruth family, including his surviving 
daughter, Julia Ruth Stevens, and his two daughters' children, and Babe Ruth 
Baseball Inc., were estimated at $400,000 for 1989 and are expected to grow to 
at least $1 million in 1990. Roesler said that before Curtis took control of 
the Ruth marketing from Babe Ruth Baseball in 1984, annual fees amounted to 
less than $100. 
</P>
<P>
How would the Babe do if he returned in the pot-bellied flesh? 
</P>
<P>
Not badly, but he'd have more competition in a more active market. And he would 
risk being a disaster to those who would hire him as their spokesman if his 
personal excesses were as probed and criticized as those of today's stars. 
</P>
<P>
But if he controlled himself, he might outdo everybody. 
</P>
<P>
Said Daisy Sinclair, casting director for the Ogilvy &amp; Mather advertising 
agency: "I can't think of a category around that he wouldn't fit into, except 
Weight Watchers. He could do ads for vitamins because looking at him, you 
wonder how he could do what he did." 
</P>
<P>
When Ruth was the highest-paid player in baseball, the endorsement game was 
small. He got around more than any other star, endorsing a hat, a brand of 
cigar -- he puffed on them in the showroom window of the factory -- chewing 
tobacco, long johns, shoes, a watch and autographed balls given away by Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
He also backed the short-lived Babe Ruth's Home Run Candy, which lost a legal 
fight with the makers of the Baby Ruth candy bar -- named not for the Babe, but 
for Grover Cleveland's daughter, Ruth -- and a Manhattan haberdashery, Babe 
Ruth's for Men, that shut its doors in six months. 
</P>
<P>
"Commercialization was so much less then," said Robert Creamer, author of 
"Babe: The Legend Comes to Life," the definitive 1974 biography of Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it strikes me as something weird that a man dead 40 years can be a live 
property. But it's obvious that he's a recognizable personality and a 
plus-person -- that is, someone you'd like to see here now." 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of marketers evidently think the Babe is worth the price of seeing him, 
if not in person, in two dimensions. You want the Babe for a one-time ad in a 
newspaper? That will be $500. You want to put the Babe in a national print 
campaign? Pay $15,000, please. Now you want the Babe in a national multi-media 
campaign? Well, that will be $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
What do marketers want from Babe Ruth? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Power: For a Sears Business Centers campaign, the retailer paid about 
$10,000 to feature Ruth in its "heavy hitters" advertising series to sell 
several makes of personal computers. The ads -- with retouched photos of the 
Babe holding or using PCs -- noted that the products were "marked down to 
prices in your ballpark. All heavy hitters . . . Not bad, huh, Babe?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- History: For the marketers at United Valley Bank in Philadelphia, Ruth's 
image, teamed with that of teammate Lou Gehrig, provided a touchstone for its 
target group: depositors 55 and older. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're old enough to remember them, you can forget about paying for 
checking," said the slogan, above a posed shot of Ruth and Gehrig before the 
Yankee Stadium backstop. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Inspiration: The Carlson Marketing Group's motivation division used Ruth's 
image and his words -- "Baseball is a great teacher" -- on a poster to gussy up 
a baseball-oriented incentive program designed for computer sales forces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dependability: Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. featured a photo of Ruth's 
"called shot" in the 1932 World Series against Chicago Cub pitcher Charlie Root 
to illustrate reliability. 
</P>
<P>
"A promise made, a promise kept," read the ad. 
</P>
<P>
Chattanooga cutlery maker Jim Frost produces a series of commemorative trapping 
knives named for Ruth, Gehrig and Ty Cobb. They are encased in walnut music 
boxes that play "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Frost: "This is the era of name recognition, and we've gone this route to 
promote our merchandise. On the Ruth knife, we have an etching of him on the 
blade and an authorization slip that tells some of his history. We limit 
production to 3,000 pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Management Group has carved a specialty out of marketing celebrities. 
Besides Ruth, Gehrig and Cobb, Curtis' sports clientele -- featuring 27 Hall of 
Famers -- includes Honus Wagner, Roberto Clemente, Casey Stengel, Bob Feller, 
Vince Lombardi, Jim Thorpe and Jesse Owens. Its entertainment- and 
historical-figure roster features James Dean, Fred Astaire, Humphrey Bogart, 
Mark Twain and Amelia Earhart. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a baseball legend wanted by marketers is out of Curtis' realm. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jeff Stevens, merchandising director of the Baseball Hall of Fame: "If 
something we're doing is beyond the scope of the agreement the Hall of Famers 
have directly with the Hall for products we sell in our gift shop or through 
our catalogue, we go to Curtis. In fact, we're doing a series of 1991 calendars 
that use only Curtis clients." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis has been especially active in the last year, increasing its stable of 
baseball clients to about 30 former players. 
</P>
<P>
The year just past was the biggest yet for Lou Gehrig licensing, because of the 
50th anniversary of his emotional retirement from baseball and Major League 
Baseball's dedication of the season to the ALS Foundation, which raises funds 
to research a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's Disease. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-seven companies are "Iron Horse" licensees, many for products tied to 
the U.S. Postal Service's issue of a Gehrig stamp last June. 
</P>
<P>
Some estates restrict what the legends can sell. 
</P>
<P>
In Ruth's case, his daughters have barred liquor and tobacco ads. 
</P>
<P>
In Gehrig's case, said Roesler: "We respect Eleanor Gehrig's wish not to use 
Lou Gehrig for fund-raising purposes. He's not licensed for any ALS research 
group except the one at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center (the Eleanor and 
Lou Gehrig ALS Center), though we allowed the ALS Foundation to do a few 
specific things this year." 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Gehrig left her estate and the rights to market her husband to the 
medical center, which derived a six-figure licensing income this year. 
</P>
<P>
Properties such as Ruth and Gehrig, valuable in life and death, are protected. 
Curtis has 18 infringement suits pending, including a protracted action against 
Macmillan Publishing Co. over an engagement calendar that Curtis alleges 
illegally used a photograph of Ruth; and two against card collector firms for 
alleged unauthorized use of the images of 10 of its players on card sets. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity representatives are gaining more protection because of new state laws 
that grant the dead stars' exclusive licensing rights to their heirs for a 
specified number of years. For example, California's 1985 law grants the heirs 
licensing rights for 50 years after a celebrity's death; Oklahoma's term is 100 
years, Nevada's 50 and Tennessee's 10. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the 50-year bell tolls on Babe Ruth in 1998, there are other legal 
ways to protect his name and likeness. Curtis has secured trademark protection 
in categories such as paper goods, gifts, apparel and footwear that will 
protect the family's rights as long as their legacy's name and image stay in 
continual use. 
</P>
<P>
So as long as the Ruth legend remains a never-dying part of the magic and lore 
of baseball, it seems clear that marketers will turn to him when they want to 
ally their product or message with his ever-living mystique. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at today's players: most have professional credibility, but not the 
extra spark of charisma," said Marty Blackman, who advises corporations on the 
use of personalities in commercials. "But when you look for a spokesman, you 
want professional credibility, which Ruth had with his hitting and home runs; 
and charisma, which he really had. He's one of those people who rose to the top 
and just stayed there."

Big Ten-bound Penn State has been sent a letter by Atlantic 10 officials, 
suggesting that the school leave the conference by June 30, the Pittsburgh 
Press reported. Penn State had announced Tuesday that it would join the Big 
Ten. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic 10's decision was reached Wednesday in a telephone conference call 
involving the athletic directors of the nine other conference schools, the 
newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State has said it intends to remain in the Atlantic 10 through the 1990-91 
season, but Atlantic 10 Commissioner Ron Bertovich, who is negotiating 
television contracts, said he doesn't like the Nittany Lions' lame-duck status. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State President Bryce Jordan has declined to reveal the school's plans 
concerning the Atlantic 10, saying, "I just wouldn't be interested in 
commenting until I saw the letter."

LOYOLA'S GATHERS WILL RETURN TO PRACTICE NEXT WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Loyola Marymount's Hank Gathers will sit out Saturday night's game against 
Oklahoma but has been given medical clearance to return to practice next week. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers missed Tuesday night's 117-113 victory at Oregon State while undergoing 
a second battery of medical tests to determine why he blacked out during a game 
on Dec. 9. He has registered normal on all of the tests, but doctors want him 
to rest this week after undergoing two more days of examinations. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-7, 210-pound Gathers, who led the nation in scoring and rebounding 
last season, had played 96 consecutive games in his college career -- including 
69 in a row at Loyola after transferring from USC -- before having to sit out 
this week's pair of games. 
</P>
<P>
"All the tests they did indicate that I am in great physical condition. I feel 
fine and I'm still the strongest man in the country," Gathers said after being 
released from Daniel Freeman Hospital Wednesday. "I'm still sore from all the 
testing . . . I guess what happened to me was just one of those things." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors found no apparent reason for Gathers' fainting and assume it was an 
"isolated insidious incident." He had no history of blackouts and had never 
been hospitalized before the brief spell, which occurred in against UC Santa 
Barbara. ALAN DROOZ

RAMS' GROUND CREW AIMING TO BAT 1,000; 
</P>
<P>
STATISTICS: PRO BOWL LINEMEN DETERMINED TO HELP GREG BELL GAIN THE 73 YARDS 
NEEDED TO JOIN 1,000-YARD CLUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Here's a standing headline for the 1980s: Rams Place Three Offensive Linemen in 
Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
It happened again this week, only this time it raised some eyebrows. The Rams' 
line, so long a faceless bureau of impressive rushing statistics, faces an 
identity crisis. It enters Sunday's season finale against the New England 
Patriots blocking for a tailback who might not reach 1,000 yards for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't DiMaggio's streak here, but the Rams are working on seven 
consecutive seasons of placing someone in the 1,000-yard club. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell needs 73 yards against the Patriots to keep it alive. He hasn't 
gained that many in one game in seven weeks. Don't count him out yet, Bell 
insists. 
</P>
<P>
Still, be advised: This is John Robinson's 14th season as a coach, his seventh 
with the Rams after seven years at USC. Guess how many times he hasn't had a 
1,000-yard rusher in his backfield? 
</P>
<P>
Robinson guessed none. Actually, it happened during his last year at USC, 1982, 
when Todd Spencer led the Trojans with 596 yards. You remember what Robinson 
did next. He left USC to start another streak. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years later, the Rams' running game, once the fabric of their existence, 
is run of the mill. The team is averaging 111 net rushing yards a game, four 
below the league average. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Eric Dickerson averaged 131.5 yards on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Some blame Bell for the decline -- a natural choice. Yet the Rams averaged 125 
yards in 1988 with him in the backfield, Bell gaining 1,212 yards to finish 
fourth in the league. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, most of the running holes have been merely cracks this season. At 
times, Bell would have been better off carrying a pickax. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there has been no real panic among the Ram linemen, no calling for heads. 
Why? Because the Rams are 10-5 and headed for the playoffs, barring an 
unexpected attack of cold feet in New England. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it surprised some Wednesday when tackle Jackie Slater, center Doug Smith 
and guard Tom Newberry were named to the NFC Pro Bowl squad. 
</P>
<P>
Were the selections made on reputations alone? 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, my year wasn't an outstanding year, by any means," Smith said 
Thursday. "But it kind of depends on how everyone else in the league performs. 
There's a lot of variables involved in it." 
</P>
<P>
Newberry argues that the line only pleads guilty to changing with the times. 
Where they once built their reputations as run-blockers for the team's former 
star, Dickerson, they've now become more proficient pass-blockers to protect 
quarterback Jim Everett, the present and future star. 
</P>
<P>
It seems a logical progression. 
</P>
<P>
"Our pass protection has been better this year than it's ever been," Newberry 
said. "The big emphasis now is on pass-rushers, and a lot of emphasis is being 
put on them in the media. I think maybe the pass-blockers are getting more 
respect from the pass-rushers, by doing a good job against them." 
</P>
<P>
The running game will probably never be what it was because the Rams will not 
likely be graced with another back the caliber of Dickerson. Besides, with 
Everett, who has time to run? 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have become a finesse team that rarely practices in full pads, once a 
midweek tradition to reaffirm their physical style. Today, three of their 
linemen -- Smith, Slater and Irv Pankey -- are well into their 30s, so some 
preservation techniques are welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
The result? The Rams aren't running as much or as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest adjustment is that we're not as sore on Mondays anymore," said 
Slater, dean of the line at 35. "So it's been real smooth. We strive to have 
balance on our line and we're going to constantly strive to run the football. 
We feel like we have to run the football to be successful. I think we kind of 
got back to doing some of that this past week (against the New York Jets). If 
we're going to be where we want to be when this is all done, we're going to 
have to run the football well from this point on." 
</P>
<P>
Slater hasn't been able to pinpoint the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things have gone wrong," he said. "You can't put your finger on one 
particular thing. But I think we've got to do it. We will do it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said you can't help think pass when that's all you do. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of just started doing it, throwing the ball a lot on first down," he 
said. "It kind of gets a bit frustrating, but we've always been a good 
pass-blocking team. Now, we're just doing it more often." 
</P>
<P>
Another reason could be the strategies employed by opposing defenses. Despite 
the undeniable success of the Rams' passing game, teams persist in stopping 
their running game with eight- and nine-man defensive fronts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Rams are averaging 263 yards through the air. 
</P>
<P>
Bell suggests if teams want to stop the run while surrendering that kind of 
yardage, he's willing to get pounded through the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"They're winning the battles but we're winning the war," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Bell said opponents have copied the nine-man fronts used against the Rams by 
the New Orleans Saints, the NFL's No. 1 team against the rush. 
</P>
<P>
At what price? In the Rams' 20-17 overtime victory over the Saints in the 
Superdome Nov. 26, Bell was held to 17 yards in 11 carries. Elsewhere, Flipper 
Anderson was setting a single-game receiving record with 336 yards in 15 
catches, and Everett was passing for a career-high 454 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing New Orleans does is put nine people up front and bring the free 
safety up, and he makes a great deal of tackles," Bell said. "A lot of teams 
that have played us have gradually snuck that guy up in the middle, and he 
causes a lot of problems with the running game. At the same time, Flipper 
Anderson and Henry Ellard are going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
If Bell does gain 73 yards, it would give the Rams a 4,000-yard passer, two 
1,000-yard receivers and a 1,000-yard rusher. 
</P>
<P>
Any more eyebrows out of place? 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams announced the signing of free-agent linebacker Jerry Leggett, from Cal 
State Fullerton, a ninth-round draft pick of the New Orleans Saints in 1989. 
Leggett will join the developmental squad.

FAVORED INVITED GUEST IS AN EASY WINNER IN FEATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Invited Guest came from last to defeat six fillies and mares in Thursday's 
$45,000 allowance feature race at Hollywood Park. Invited Guest, the favorite, 
covered the 1 1/16 miles in 1 minute 42 1/5 seconds en route to his 1 
1/4-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Invited Guest moved past the $500,000 mark in career 
earnings. The winners' share of $24,750 increased owner R.D. Hubbard's account 
to $511,654 from nine wins, seven seconds and three thirds in 29 starts. 
</P>
<P>
The winner, ridden by Robbie Davis, paid $6.00, $4.20 and $3.20. Heather And 
Rose finished second and paid $5.60 and $3.60, and White Mischief returned 
$4.00. 
</P>
<P>
White Mischief, winner of the Hillsborough Handicap at Bay Meadows on Nov. 11, 
took the lead on the backstretch and opened a 1 1/2-length margin heading into 
the final turn. 
</P>
<P>
Davis moved Invited Guest out from behind horses on the backstretch and she 
quickly circled the field on the turn. The first three finishers raced as team 
briefly turning for home before Invited Guest asserted herself in the final 
furlong.

A state appeals court Thursday refused to reinstate Hialeah Park's pari-mutuel 
license, which was suspended after the track changed its racing schedule 
without permission. 
</P>
<P>
The 1st District Court of Appeal declined to lift the suspension ordered by the 
Department of Business Regulation. That means the track will be closed until at 
least Jan. 3, when a full state hearing is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the financially troubled South Florida thoroughbred track announced 
it would operate three days a week rather than the six days a week required 
under its license.

RACERS FIND A BOATLOAD OF TROUBLE AT SEA

<P>
The fifth Whitbread Round the World Race for the Beefeater Trophy will be at 
sea for Christmas, scheduled to depart Fremantle, Australia, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Since leaving Plymouth, England, on Sept. 2, the 23 entries have experienced 
two deaths, survival conditions and an incredibly close finish of the second 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
The boat Fisher &amp; Paykel of New Zealand led for most of the 7,650-nautical 
mile leg -- the longest and most difficult -- from Punta del Este, Uruguay, 
through the Southern Ocean to Fremantle. Then it was becalmed one day off 
Australia, allowing New Zealand's Steinlager 2, England's Rothmans and 
Switzerland's Merit to finish ahead. After sailing almost a third of the 
distance around the world on that leg, skipper Peter Blake steered Steinlager 2 
into Fremantle 1 hour, 33 minutes ahead of Rothmans, followed by Merit 28 
seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
John Jourdane of Long Beach, navigator on Fisher &amp; Paykel, reported via 
British Telecom Data that winds up to 50 knots pushed his boat through steep, 
icy seas at an average speed of 11.5 knots, with one six-day run of 2,051 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a 6 1/2-day Transpac," Jourdane said. 
</P>
<P>
The Transpac record from Pt. Fermin to Honolulu is 8 1/2 days by Merlin in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
"It was extremely cold for two weeks, with snow and ice covering the deck 
almost every day," Jourdane said. "We saw icebergs on six different days. At 
one point, the lines on the winches were frozen solid and wouldn't move." 
</P>
<P>
Trying to hold their footing on icy decks, six crewmen went overboard from 
various boats. All were recovered, although one -- Anthony Phillips, 36, of the 
British entry Creighton's Naturally -- died of hypothermia after a half-hour in 
the water. At his parents' request, he was buried at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Jourdane said: "Every one of us clipped our life harnesses on and held on a 
little tighter. It brought home just how close we are sailing to danger and 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Etienne Giroire, on Sweden's The Card, broke an arm, and Rafael Tibau, on 
Spain's Fortuna, broke a leg. But icebergs and icy decks were only some of the 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
"A pod of six blue whales, 50 to 80 feet long, stayed with us for two days," 
Jourdane said. 
</P>
<P>
During the layover at Punta del Este, Soviet skipper Alexei Gryshenko, 43, was 
found hanged in a tree, apparently a suicide. Co-skipper Skip Novak of Chicago 
continued to sail the Soviet entry, Fazisi, and placed 10th on the second leg 
for ninth overall. 
</P>
<P>
Steinlager 2 leads the overall standings, followed by Merit, Fisher &amp; 
Paykel and Rothmans. There are no American entries, although the fleet is 
scheduled to make the event's first American landfall ever at Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla., in early or mid-April before sailing the last leg to England. 
</P>

Sailing Notes 
</P>
<P>
OLYMPICS -- The U.S. Olympic Yachting Committee, unlike 1988, is taking care to 
match wind conditions at the '92 trials sites with the Olympic courses off 
Barcelona, Spain. Four of the 10 classes -- the men's and women's 470, Finn and 
women's European dinghy -- have been scheduled for Newport Beach in mid-April 
of '92 and Star and Flying Dutchman for Miami in late April. Soling, Tornado 
and men's and women's sailboards are undetermined but probably will be 
somewhere in Florida, although Marina del Rey is possible for Tornado. 
Meteorologist Chris Bedford, who worked with Dennis Conner in the '87 America's 
Cup at Fremantle, Australia, has been to Spain to check conditions. OYC 
Chairman Mike Schoettle of Los Angeles said the selection of the sailboard site 
is so fine that a minimum prevailing breeze of 11 knots -- Barcelona conditions 
-- is the breaking point. "That's when a sailboard stops sailing on its bottom 
and starts sailing on its edge," Schoettle said. 
</P>
<P>
AMERICA'S CUP -- One of the more bizarre bids has come from Charles Ellery, who 
identified himself as commodore of the Portola Sail Yacht Club of Santa Cruz, 
which he said dates only to 1987 , has no clubhouse and charges only $60 for 
lifetime dues. Ellery proposed to raise a $26-million budget and use an 
all-women crew skippered by '88 Olympic gold medalist Allison Jolly of Long 
Beach. Without her commitment or permission, he has used her name in proposals 
to race organizers and potential sponsors. Jolly said: "I've met him once. I 
have a feeling this isn't anything I want to be connected with." Ellery also 
said he has "invited Mr. Bill Lee of Santa Cruz 70 yacht fame to design and 
build (the boat)." Apparently, Lee has nothing to do with it, either. . . . 
Ellery's proposal is not to be confused with that of Philip Freedman of San 
Diego, an operations agent at Lindbergh Field, who bought the America II 
12-meter and hopes to try for the Cup as the Betsy Ross syndicate with a crew 
of no fewer than 40% women on one of the new 90-foot America's Cup class boats. 
. . . Whichever way the final court decision goes, New Zealand plans to launch 
its new boat by next October. 
</P>
<P>
MATCH RACING -- The 26th Congressional Cup, March 14-17, off Long Beach appears 
to have its strongest field. The announced entries are topped by defending 
champion Rod Davis, the only three-time winner and a native of San Diego, who 
again will represent the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, along with Chris 
Dickson and 1984 Olympic Finn class gold medalist Russell Coutts; America's Cup 
campaigner Peter Isler of San Diego; Paul Cayard of San Francisco, representing 
his Italian America's Cup syndicate; '88 Olympic Soling silver medalist John 
Kostecki of San Francisco; John Kolius of Houston; '88 winner Peter Gilmour of 
Australia; Larry Klein of San Diego and Mike Elias of Long Beach, the host club 
entry. Klein won the Ficker Cup sailoff to become the wild-card entry and, as 
'89 world Etchells and J-24 champion, is expected to succeed Kostecki as the 
Rolex yachtsman of the year. . . . The Long Beach Yacht Club plans to use new 
Catalina 37s, the first strict racing boats designed specifically for the 
event, after 10 years of borrowing Catalina 38 racer-cruisers, which followed 
Cal 40s. Only one of the 37s is built, but Catalina Yachts President Frank 
Butler promised that the other 10 -- including one spare -- will be built in 
January. Butler has agreed to lend the boats to the Congressional for five 
years and they may be used in other events. 
</P>
<P>
NOTEWORTHY -- The Women's Sailing Assn. of Santa Monica Bay has scheduled its 
annual Super Bowl Race Clinic to start Jan. 22, with a graduation race on game 
day Jan. 28. Details: (818) 786-8173. . . . Gino Morrelli, who helped design 
the Stars &amp; Stripes catamaran, is head of syndicate operations for the 
Chula Vista Challenge for the Little America's Cup in January 1991 at McCrae, 
Australia. Also on the design team is Steve Dair, who, with his brother, Bryan 
Dair, sailed the fast, radical but ill-fated Cabrillo Beach YC see-saw-sail 
"Wingmill" that broke apart in a helicopter's wash just before the first race 
was to start in February. A skipper hasn't been chosen yet, but the team also 
includes Olympic Tornado sailor Pete Melvin of Long Beach and the veteran Roy 
Seaman of Malibu.

FUTILELY SEEKING SPECTACLE IN NEW B'WAY MUSICALS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This was going to be the season that the Broadway musical made a comeback. 
Maybe so. "City of Angels" got strong reviews and will have a healthy run at 
the Virginia Theater, and "Grand Hotel" is not going to have to check out of 
the Martin Beck next week. 
</P>
<P>
In performance, however, neither show ignites an audience the way -- I hate to 
say this -- "Phantom of the Opera" does. This may very well have to do with the 
cost of tickets on Broadway these days. This season's top ticket is $55. Having 
laid out $110 for two orchestra seats, the viewer and his companion are ready 
to undergo a major experience, not just enjoy a good show. 
</P>
<P>
So, it's a bit of a comedown when Larry Gelbart's "City of Angels" turns out to 
be merely a witty sendup of Hollywood's B movies and C movie executives, to a 
neat jazz score by Cy Coleman. And it's a puzzle that "Grand Hotel's" 
revolving-door choreography (by Tommy Tune) seems to deposit the audience out 
on the street two hours later with nothing to take back to the hotel but the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Each show, in other words, is over when it's over. That used to be enough for 
the Broadway visitor. If you couldn't get tickets to "South Pacific," you would 
settle for "Hazel Flagg." But unreasonable prices have bred unreasonable 
expectations. Too bad. Taken on their own terms, "City of Angels" and "Grand 
Hotel" offer their own pleasures -- rather different ones. 
</P>
<P>
The first musical is basically a word-show. That's not to put down Coleman's 
score, which harks back to the cool sounds of the Hi-Lo's and the torchy sounds 
of, oh, Jane Froman. Nor do we mean to ignore the Robin Wagner settings and the 
rest of the show's design, which is to die for, especially if you are into old 
movies and late-1940s Hollywood decor. One speaks of black-and-white films, but 
lighting designer Paul Gallow reminds us that they were really in 
blue-and-white. But Gelbart's book is the real energy source for "City of 
Angels." Actually, it's two books at once: the private-dick flick that 
new-to-Hollywood writer Gregg Edelman is trying to wrest from his own novel, 
and Edelman's real-life adventures getting his script past his awful 
producer-director -- Rene Auberjonois at his fox-in-the-chicken-coop best. 
</P>
<P>
Funny stuff, whether the private-eye (James Naughton) is untangling a 
hoity-toity dame from her fake story (Dee Hoty), or whether the writer is 
trying to cope with the same dame -- i.e., the actress who'll play her in the 
movie -- at one of those Hollywood brunches. This part of the show is in color, 
but the kissy-kissy dialogue is just as rococo as the gumshoe stuff, and it 
strikes you that these people too are acting out a movie -- "The Bad and the 
Beautiful," perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
Gelbart wants us to take his brunch bunch seriously, however. Yes, they are 
cartoons -- the tramp starlet, the sold-out composer -- but they also suggest 
the price that a writer of integrity must pay when he sups with the devil. When 
Gelbart gets righteous about such matters, the show gets corny. But generally, 
it's smart enough to stay on the surface, playing word-games with the detective 
genre and slyly noting how writers have a way of working their own lives into 
the plot. Gelbart's "Hollywood ending" has the private eye and the writer 
ganging up on Auberjonois right in the middle of his sound stage, but we don't 
have to believe it, and probably shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
It's an amusing, highly stylish pastiche, without a moment's involvement, 
barring some slight sympathy for Randy Graff, who plays Effie to the 
detective's Sam Spade and does even more for the writer, to no reward. We like 
her, love Auberjonois, the rascal, admire the ingenuity of the concept and 
execution -- and realize that, for all this, the show is basically a trifle. 
</P>
<P>
"Grand Hotel" leaves the same impression, and that's strange, for it goes for 
big emotions. Birth, death, sex, robbery, stock fraud -- everything happens at 
"Grand Hotel." And it happens without a pause. 
</P>
<P>
Tune's choreography makes the show one long, whirling sweep through a gold and 
black ballroom, now this face etched in the spotlight now that. (The most 
prominent faces: Liliane Montevecchi as a burned-out ballerina, David Carroll 
as a well-born jewel thief, Jane Krakowski as a typist who can't possibly live 
on the money she makes from that.) 
</P>
<P>
The story gets told and the score (by Robert Wright and George Forest with 
additional material by Maury Yeston) is rousingly sung. But by the time the 
cast assembles for the curtain call, one realizes that essentially that is what 
"Grand Hotel" has been all evening, one long, beautifully staged curtain call. 
Very nice. Very entertaining. Now . . . where should we eat?

A LONG TRIP ENDS WITH A LONG GAME;

LAKERS: JOHNSON, WORTHY HELP TIRED LOS ANGELES OVERCOME HOT-SHOOTING 
TIMBERWOLVES IN OVERTIME, 106-97.;

WEDNESDAY'S GAME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
His cheeks puffed out like Dizzy Gillespie's and his chest heaving, James 
Worthy slouched near midcourt after the Lakers had tamed the Minnesota 
Timberwolves in overtime Wednesday night, 106-97. 
</P>
<P>
Along came Magic Johnson, who stood next to his Laker teammate and gave him a 
brief smile and an even briefer hug. They were too tuckered out to exchange 
high-fives, back slaps or any other more taxing celebration. 
</P>
<P>
So ended an eight-game, 12-day trip, one that tested the Lakers' cardiovascular 
endurance and mental alertness everywhere from the snowbound East to balmy 
Florida to the frigid Midwest. The Lakers won five of eight games and headed 
back to Los Angeles on a late-night charter still leading the Pacific Division 
with a 19-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was fitting that it ended with an exhalation of relief, rather than 
exaltation, because this was anything but a pleasure trip for the Lakers. About 
the best you can say is that they absorbed their opponents' best shots and, for 
the most part, endured. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, somewhat ambitiously, had set a goal of 6-2 on the trip. They fell 
a victory short by blowing a 14-point fourth-quarter lead at Orlando, but they 
seemed satisfied overall. 
</P>
<P>
"A 5-3 trip is successful, as far as I'm concerned," Coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
"This makes my whole Christmas," Johnson said. "It was the best way to end the 
trip. We never quit; that's the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Enduring was the central theme again Wednesday night against the expansion 
Timberwolves. The Lakers, clearly dragging and flu-ridden, suffered through a 
first half in which the expansion Timberwolves shot 74.3% from the field and 
took a 12-point lead behind former Laker Tony Campbell, who had 18 of his 26 
points by halftime. The Lakers faced a 15-point third-quarter deficit. 
</P>
<P>
But, they mustered the resolve to finish off the Timberwolves and finish the 
trip with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I saw it," Worthy said, "we had taken their best shot. We just felt if 
we kept plugging we'd be in there." 
</P>
<P>
Overtime could not have been what the Lakers had in mind, but it took a 
monumental second-half comeback even to get to that position. 
</P>
<P>
After spending the fourth quarter whittling away at Minnesota's lead, the 
Lakers caught the Timberwolves (5-19) with 7.2 seconds to play when, after Sam 
Mitchell missed a free throw, Johnson went the length of the court for a 
score-tying layup. 
</P>
<P>
In overtime the Lakers summoned enough effort to outscore Minnesota by nine 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good way to end a long, long trip," Riley said. "I think our guys 
showed the effects of the trip, but you have to give them credit. The way they 
came back was indicative of their character and resolve. And, you want to thank 
Earvin Johnson (for making) the shot he had to with no timeouts left." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who had 26 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists; and Worthy, who had 
24 points, were the steadying influences during a mostly lethargic effort. So, 
it was not surprising that Johnson took control when the Lakers needed it most. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had a chance to tie it nine seconds before Johnson's layup. A.C. 
Green, who had 16 points and 15 rebounds while once again starting at center in 
place of injured Mychal Thompson, missed one of two free throws that would have 
tied it, 90-90. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Lakers fouled Mitchell one second after Green's second free throw. 
But Mitchell, a rookie forward who had 24 points, missed the second of two free 
throws for a 91-89 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Woolridge grabbed the rebound, and Johnson immediately moved toward the 
ball. Near midcourt, Johnson paused to check the clock and avoid Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson twisted between Mitchell and Campbell and banked in the layup to tie 
it. Minnesota then tried to score quickly, but Green knocked away Sidney Lowe's 
pass. With 3.7 seconds left, three Lakers converged on Campbell, who bobbled 
the inbounds pass and dropped it out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
A full-length Laker inbounds pass with 1.4 seconds intended for Woolridge went 
astray, but Johnson ran it down and flung it over his left shoulder toward the 
basket. It hit the rim and fell out. 
</P>
<P>
Such a miraculous finish somehow would not have been appropriate for the Lakers 
on this trip. They had to work overtime to earn the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were in control the entire five minutes, a departure from their only 
previous overtime experience, when they went scoreless against the Detroit 
Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
When it was finally over, the Lakers were happy but a little tired. 
</P>
<P>
"No, a lot tired," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
That could only partially account for the continuation of their outside 
shooting problems. The Lakers made only 39.8% of their shots, but found success 
in the second half using a bigger lineup featuring Woolridge and Vlade Divac 
against the smaller Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge, in his best game since coming off the injured list last week, scored 
20 points and had six rebounds. Divac added 16 points and 11 rebounds in 29 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a lot more comfortable out there," Woolridge said. "There are still 
times when I feel tentative. But I'm glad Pat had the confidence in me to leave 
me in there." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he had no choice but to go with a big lineup, since Laker guards 
were not hitting. Byron Scott made only two of 10 shots and failed to reach 
double figures for the third consecutive game. Michael Cooper missed all five 
shots he attempted. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got to get in the habit of moving the ball again," Riley said. "We've 
only had one or two practices in the last two weeks. So, right now, our offense 
is sluggish, lethargic and boring." 
</P>
<P>
All of those conditions hit the Lakers at one time or another during this trip. 
Yet, they endured and now play eight of their next 10 games at home. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't tired at all," said Scott, in obvious sarcasm. "We can go another 
four or five days on the road. Find us some more games." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Byron Scott has made only two of his last 17 shots. Coach Pat Riley said the 
Lakers need to improve the ball movement in the half-court offense to enable 
Scott to take open jump shots. Said Scott: "I'm kind of hesitating too much. 
I'll just call it a little slump. You got to keep going and play both ends of 
the court (offense and defense)." Scott's defense limited former Laker Tony 
Campbell to six points in the second half. . . . Campbell on the Lakers: "I 
knew Magic wouldn't let them lose to an expansion team. I think the Lakers are 
still the Lakers. They may not be as glamorous without Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar), 
but they are still a great team." . . . The Lakers are 4-1 without Mychal 
Thompson, out with bursitis in his left heel. But they could have used Thompson 
for inside offense the last two games. Thompson said he hopes to return on Dec. 
26, when the Lakers play Sacramento at the Forum.

Many parents bought computer games this Christmas, some just because they have 
a home computer and want their child to learn something while fooling around. 
</P>
<P>
It would certainly get the kids away from the TV or the Nintendo. It involves 
some reading, if only of the manual. And there are great-looking games now, 
with dungeons, warlords, space travel, mazes and mysteries -- obviously pure 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
But these aren't video games, and computers aren't television sets. New buyers 
often find themselves up to their keyboards in problems. They can't "load" the 
game onto the computer. Or they can't figure out how to play it. 
</P>
<P>
Or they can't get beyond a certain point in the game. With Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit, they never manage to navigate the highway to the nightclub, where the 
real action begins. With King's Quest, they never get the little hero much past 
the goat pen near the start of his journey. With Flight Simulator, they never 
land a plane without crashing. 
</P>
<P>
Devised by computer hackers in the days before personal computers, computer 
games now have sales of $262.6 million a year, having risen 30% between 1987 
and 1988. But they're still a hacker's hobby and only 10% of the $2-billion 
software market. 
</P>
<P>
Computers themselves aren't mass market yet. They're present in only 20% of 
American homes, according to the Software Publishers Assn. in Washington. 
Keyboard-driven, coded with "commands," they're not easy to operate, unlike 
arcade and video games. They're not even standardized: Each computer needs its 
"compatible" game version and a proper-sized disk. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are ever more computers out there, and their owners are changing 
the profile of the computer game player. "Not hackers or hobbyists, these are 
people who got their computer for Christmas," says Peter Spear, a computer game 
expert and author of the book "King's Quest Companion." 
</P>
<P>
"They think they bought a toaster, and they want to plug it in and have it 
work," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Too commonly, such people "have 128K computers and they're buying 640K games," 
says Mason Rutledge, spokesman for Egghead Discount Software in Issaquah, Wash. 
More commonly, there's an incompatibility between the game's capacity and the 
player's. 
</P>
<P>
These aren't board games, all laid out, with moves and rules detailed inside 
the cover. Some require mostly speed and dexterity -- dodge-'em, shoot-'em 
arcade games or abstract puzzles such as Tetris and Revenge of Doh. Others 
involve strategy or guesswork -- simulations of flights and battles -- or 
"animated adventures" featuring journeys and mazes. 
</P>
<P>
For the computer "techie," the challenge is the game. "The hard-core veteran 
gamer will slog through 50 pages of rules and grumble," says Russell Sipe, 
editor of Anaheim-based Computer Gaming World (circulation 30,000), "but then 
play for 40 hours." Or they'll gladly start with nothing, Spear says, "part of 
the point being to discover the game as you go." 
</P>
<P>
Given the ethos, software publishers "didn't always make sure the documentation 
was easy to read," says Phillip Adam, president of Spectrum Holobyte (Tetris) 
in Alameda, "or that the game had documentation." 
</P>
<P>
Where manuals exist, they're often elliptical, for readers who say, "Don't ever 
give me an answer, give me a clue," Spear says. A King's Quest game, for 
example, comes with a fairy tale introducing the kingdom featured and a 
"reference card" outlining the key commands, but it leaves players to guess 
that when a condor flies overhead, one should type "jump," projecting the 
little hero onto its back to fly to the next scene. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, these games began as group entertainment: Players shared the 
experience, comparing notes, admiring graphics. Computer Gaming World's roster 
of 10 top games is not a list of best-sellers but of readers' own ratings. Even 
kids work together, particularly the adolescent boys who form an obsessive 
subgroup of the market, "playing in groups of two, three or four," says one 
mother, "talking on the telephone, passing around lore. If they all get stuck, 
whoever has a hint book brings it out." 
</P>
<P>
There's some help available from vendors, but it indicates their ambivalence 
about serving a mass market. "The core market is always going to be there, and 
companies want that market badly," Sipe says. "The number of users is smaller, 
but the amount of money spent is so much larger -- $50 a month on computer 
games, compared to four games a year for the mass market buyer." 
</P>
<P>
There may be hint booklets, as with King's Quest, but some consumers are 
offended when asked to pay $6 for guidance on playing a $40 game. Worse, they 
move by hints, coyly printed in ink revealed by a special pen: "How do I figure 
out the gnome's name?" "Read the note you found on the witch's bed stand for a 
hint." 
</P>
<P>
Publishers do offer "technical support" by phone but apparently find no message 
in the fact that people have so many questions. Few provide 800 numbers (except 
for orders): They can't afford it, they say, given their limited sales volume, 
and they have some disdain for the questions. Kids pester them, people want 
help using their computers, callers waste calls on what one vendor calls 
"solvable problems" -- things they should have figured out themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Some retailers help, although as interest grows and popular games sell 
themselves, retailers do less work. Some let customers open and try games in 
the store, or return the goods after purchase -- most famously, the 205-store 
Egghead chain. "You may buy a product far beyond your capabilities," Mason 
Rutledge says, "and you won't know till you try it." (One consequence: 
Consumers may find that Egghead games, rewrapped and resold, have strangers 
already signed on as players.) 
</P>
<P>
Because the new buyer of computer games is truly up against something new, "my 
personal advice," says computer analyst Lawrence Magid, "is if your kid says he 
played something at Johnny's and liked it, then you buy it." It's still a 
word-of-mouth industry.

L.A. APPAREL MAKERS HANG BY A THREAD; 
</P>
<P>
MANUFACTURING: BIG RETAILERS' WOES ARE SPREADING TO LOCAL GARMENT MAKERS, WHO 
ARE CUTTING PRODUCTION AND LAYING OFF WORKERS. SMALL CONTRACTORS ARE HARDEST 
HIT. 
</P>

<P>
The ills afflicting the nation's major retailers are also hitting the Los 
Angeles apparel industry hard, throwing many workers out of their jobs and 
apparently putting some manufacturers and contractors in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very shaky situation," said Menachem Treivush, head of a Los Angeles 
firm that produces apparel under the Ton Sur Ton and Bonney Strauss labels. 
</P>
<P>
From 1985 to 1987, apparel and textile production boomed in Los Angeles County, 
and the industry cemented its position as the area's No. 2 manufacturing 
employer. But now, jobs are being lost even as Los Angeles emerges as a fashion 
design center. 
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that the county's apparel and textile manufacturing 
employment in October totaled 87,600. That number has crept up somewhat from 
the annual summer doldrums, but it is down 2,200 from October, 1988, and off 
6,100 from October, 1987. Nationally, the job total has fallen a gradual 8% 
over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say the local employment figure has declined partly because of 
the movement of more apparel workers into underground sweatshops where, 
unreported to government authorities, illegal immigrants and other employees 
are paid exploitatively low wages. 
</P>
<P>
But industry observers said there also has been a downturn recently in Los 
Angeles' apparel industry because of the financial struggles of Campeau Corp. 
and other major retailers, along with rising imports and expectations of 
slowing sales to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Those developments have dealt another blow to a local industry that, analysts 
say, was stung earlier by the loss of many apparel workers because of the 
nation's immigration reform law and the increase in California's minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
Probably those hardest hit have been the hundreds of small contractors, 
typically employing no more than 50 or 60 people, that are the backbone of the 
apparel industry. Joseph Rodriguez, executive director of the Garment 
Contractors Assn. of Southern California, said "dozens" of firms in his 
association have laid off, or shortened the work weeks of, employees who sew or 
cut fabric. 
</P>
<P>
"Some (contractors) are even considering selling," Rodriguez said. "They're 
scrambling around. Business is not good in the contracting world." 
</P>
<P>
The list of victims also includes the likes of Jody Apparel, a dress 
manufacturer that is scheduled to close in January after 27 years in business. 
As recently as two years ago, it reported annual sales of $50 million and 250 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Miller, the Southern California regional manager for the California 
Division of Labor Standards, said the downturn has sparked more complaints to 
his agency. For example, Miller said, there has been a big rise in the past few 
months in the number of apparel-sewing contractors alleging that they are not 
being paid by their customers, the so-called manufacturing firms that actually 
design and market clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Other contractors, Miller said, complain that they are being put under extra 
pressure to hold down costs. "It's leaving a lot of contractors in a bind," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said his office also was contacted this month by two groups, each 
consisting of about 20 to 30 apparel workers, who claimed that they had not 
been paid by their employers for two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent tremor to shake the local apparel industry has been the 
decision by a growing number of credit companies, known as factors, to stop 
approving garment makers' shipments to Bloomingdale's and other department 
stores owned by Toronto-based Campeau. Over the past week, the nation's two 
biggest factors -- CIT Group/Factoring and Heller Financial -- have halted 
credit for new orders to the far-flung Campeau chains. 
</P>
<P>
The factors, which collect payments for apparel makers and absorb the losses 
when bills are not paid, have acted out of fear that the Campeau stores are 
going broke. Campeau, wobbling under $10.9 billion in long-term debt mainly 
from takeovers, disclosed last week that its department store operations -- 
Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores -- might seek Chapter 11 
bankruptcy court protection by the end of next month to work out their 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Many apparel manufacturers, consequently, are withholding merchandise and 
cutting production rather than bear the risk of shipping goods without 
protection from their factors. 
</P>
<P>
"All the mergers that took place, we're paying for today," said Dina Bar-El, 
co-owner of Hi-Tech Fashions, a women's sportswear maker that over the past 
year has cut its staff from 38 to 25 people. 
</P>
<P>
Added Corky Newman, president of corporate marketing and licensing for 
Sunland-based Cherokee Group: "The factor allows us to ship X amount, and 
that's what we ship. We're a highly profitable company, and we're a highly 
disciplined company. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain risks you take in business every day. There are other risks 
that, percentage-wise, never pay off," Newman said. "And when it's in the 
papers that a company is talking about bankruptcy, we'll listen to the factors. 
</P>
<P>
"What today's business environment proves," Newman said, "is if you're not 
prudent, you won't be in business long." 
</P>
<P>
Other firms, however, don't have as much flexibility because they are stuck 
with merchandise that still needs to be sold. 
</P>
<P>
Without approval from the factors, "you either ship at your own risk, or you 
don't ship it. And if you don't ship it, you still have $300,000 of merchandise 
to unload," said Eletra Casadei, owner and designer for the Casadei Group 
women's wear firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Either way, you're going to lose money on the deal." 
</P>
<P>
Casadei said her firm so far has been able to avoid layoffs by shifting more of 
its sales to specialty shops to offset the business lost with Campeau stores. 
But she also is continuing to make some shipments to Campeau stores. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' biggest apparel maker, jeans maker Guess? Inc., said that about 
15% of its $300 million in annual sales is with Campeau stores. For about three 
months, the company has financed that business itself, without the help of a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
But Maurice Marciano, president of Guess?, estimated that his firm would halt 
about one-third of its sales to Campeau if Federated and Allied file for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and come under the control of a bankruptcy 
judge. "I don't think you'll find one company doing business with Campeau whose 
business is not affected," Marciano said. 
</P>
<P>
For Guess?, the Campeau problems have been a "significant" setback that 
ultimately could lead to the layoff of a small number of the company's roughly 
1,000 employees. But things could be worse. "A lot of small firms," Marciano 
said, "are not going to survive this crisis" because of their limited finances. 
Small firms also are being hurt by the growing tendency of retailers to buy 
from big manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The future for some apparel makers could be determined at the annual market 
week scheduled for the second week of January in New York, where retailers meet 
with manufacturers to order new merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're hanging on by your fingernails, you still make it to New York in 
January," said Gary Freedman, a Beverly Hills lawyer who represents a number of 
apparel makers. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's going to be a big shakeout -- which people are predicting -- it'll 
happen after market week," when firms return home without orders, he said.

PAN AM PLACES ADS MARKING ANNIVERSARY OF LOCKERBIE BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pan American World Airways, in advertisements placed Thursday in nine 
newspapers in the United States and Europe, called for a "moment of prayer" for 
the 270 people killed in the terrorist bombing of its Flight 103 over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The ad, which appeared in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Miami Herald 
and USA Today, along with newspapers in Scotland, England and Germany, is 
considered unusual because airlines rarely draw attention to air disasters. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we wanted to do something," said Pan Am spokeswoman Elizabeth Manners. 
</P>
<P>
The carrier also held memorial services for victims at airports in New York, 
London and Frankfurt and flew its flags at half mast. 
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie tragedy has haunted Pan Am, which lost $150 million in revenue 
earlier this year in part because fearful travelers avoided the airline. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration in September fined the airline $630,000 for 
security violations in Frankfurt, the flight's point of origin, and London, 
where it stopped before exploding in the air on its way to New York. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA said, however, that it couldn't link the security lapses to the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am has said the security problems had been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
The father of a Lockerbie victim reacted bittersweetly to Pan Am's ad. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a lovely sentiment," said Robert Berrell of Fargo, N.D., who visited the 
grave of his 20-year-old son, Robert, Thursday. "It's kind of ironic coming 
from Pan Am."

Helmsley Rejects State Plea Bargain: Hotel queen Leona Helmsley, already 
sentenced to four years in a federal prison, rejected an offer for a concurrent 
sentence in her state tax-fraud case, insisting, "I've committed no crime. I'm 
not giving up." Sitting stiffly at the defense table in state Supreme Court in 
New York, Helmsley listened silently as her lawyer, Gerald Feffer, turned down 
a plea bargain offered by the state attorney general's office. Under the 
agreement, Helmsley would plead guilty in exchange for a prison term to be 
served concurrently with the four-year federal sentence handed down on Dec. 12, 
Alfredo Mendez, assistant attorney general, indicated. Separately, bail was set 
for Helmsley at $25 million secured by her mansions in Connecticut and Arizona, 
according to federal prosecutors.

First Executive's Junk Bond Deal Examined: California regulators are 
investigating the transfer of more than $700 million in junk bonds by First 
Executive Corp. to affiliated companies, according to a report in the New York 
Times. The transaction allowed the Los Angeles insurer to reduce the amount of 
its reserves against losses by an estimated $10 million a year, the Times 
reported. The extent of the investigation by the California Department of 
Insurance and the possible outcome for First Executive could not be determined, 
according to the Times.

U.S. Memories Signs License Pact: International Business Machines will license 
its 4-megabyte dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip manufacturing 
capabilities to U.S. Memories, a proposed consortium that plans to produce 
semiconductors. The deal, which was expected, represents the third hurdle that 
the venture had to clear before it could begin operating. Earlier, the venture 
developed a business plan and received assurances that the plan does not 
violate antitrust laws. However, the final condition -- getting sufficient 
participation and financial support from American chip makers -- still remains.

Eastern Pilots Oppose Route Sale: The leaders of the Eastern Airlines pilots' 
union said they oppose the proposed sale of the airline's South and Central 
American routes to American Airlines and plan to file an objection to the 
transaction in bankruptcy court. Eastern is in bankruptcy proceedings. The 
airline's 1,800 pilots ended a damaging nine-month walkout on Nov. 22 but none 
have been rehired because Eastern replaced them during the strike.

HEATING OIL PRICES HIGHER, SUPPLIES TIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: EXTREMELY COLD, ICY WEATHER HAS MADE IT HARD FOR BARGES TO UNLOAD THEIR 
OIL CARGOES IN SOME EAST COAST HARBORS.

The cold snap gripping much of the nation is draining supplies of home heating 
oil, raising prices and causing spot shortages of the fuel, industry officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers are paying as much as $1 a gallon in parts of the Northeast, and some 
oil companies are taking steps to ensure there's enough oil to go around. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon USA, Mobil Corp. and Star Enterprise, a Texaco Inc. affiliate, reported 
some of their Northeastern terminals suffered temporary cuts in oil supply and 
that customers have been sent to other facilities or forced to wait for new 
supplies to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"These outages . . . have been maybe for a few hours," said Exxon spokesman Jim 
Davis, who said customers at the company's Everett, Mass., terminal were 
directed to nearby Waltham, where supplies were more plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
At Mobil, spokesman John Lord estimated that some customers in the Northeast 
were kept waiting an hour for heating oil to arrive by barge or pipeline, but 
"that is not the norm. The norm is no outages." 
</P>
<P>
The wait was longer at Star Enterprise's East Hartford, Conn., terminal, which 
ran out of oil Thursday and was hoping for a delivery today or Saturday, said 
Texaco spokesman Top Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
The companies placed the blame for the shortages squarely on the weather, as 
customers burned more oil or tried to stock up on extra fuel. Bad weather has 
also made it hard for barges to unload their oil cargoes in some East Coast 
harbors. 
</P>
<P>
A series of arctic air blasts has chilled the eastern half of the country for 
10 days, producing early morning temperatures Thursday of minus 28 degrees in 
Bismarck, N.D.; minus 21 in Minneapolis-St. Paul; minus 16 in Des Moines, Iowa; 
minus 1 in Albany, N.Y., and 14 in Boston.

With sales topping $30 million this year and the number of restaurants 
increasing to 11, the entrepreneurs who founded California Pizza Kitchen are 
thinking seriously about selling stock to the public. "Since day one, people 
have been after us to go public," said Rick Rosenfield, co-founder of the 
5-year-old gourmet pizza restaurant chain. "This is a natural public vehicle 
because it has a glamorous concept." At this point, Rosenfield and his partner, 
Larry Flax, both former attorneys, have enough money to expand beyond the six 
states the company currently serves. 
</P>
<P>
Down the road, they will need a huge infusion of funds to take the company 
national -- and eventually international. But they are planning to wait for at 
least a year before opening the books of their Beverly Hills-based company to 
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the world. 
</P>
<P>
Because most small-business owners initially borrow money from friends, 
relatives and private investors, they may be unsure about what it's like to 
enter the public arena. There are investment bankers to choose and financial 
statements to prepare. The timing of the offering and pricing of the shares are 
also important issues to consider. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982 and 1983, going public was the rage. Nearly every entrepreneur with a 
good idea was being courted by investment bankers desperate to discover the 
next hot moneymaker. This created a frenzy of initial public offerings, mostly 
in the high-tech, computer and biotechnology areas. 
</P>
<P>
When the promises of fabulous returns on investment failed to materialize, the 
public's interest in new companies began to wane. And after the October, 1987, 
stock market crash, investor interest in newly public companies plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
But looking ahead toward the 1990s, investment bankers say investor interest is 
picking up, but this time in industries that weren't popular in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, everyone liked computers -- right now, consumer products are 
very in," said Hal Harrigian, director of corporate finance for Crowell, Weedon 
and Co., a Los Angeles-based investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
Investment bankers also cite other businesses such as environmental cleanup 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that the sizzle and sex appeal of a company helps attract 
stockholders," Harrigian added, "but after that it is the performance that 
counts." 
</P>
<P>
Investors are generally looking to invest in companies with annual growth rates 
of 15% to 50% a year to compensate for the risk of investing in new companies, 
which experience relatively high failure rates. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, the IPO (initial public offering) market is increasingly selective and 
based on demonstrated performance," said Quentin Lilly, an associate in Smith 
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.'s Los Angeles corporate finance group. "Before 
the 1987 crash, virtually everyone and anyone could get an initial public 
offering done." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Sherwood, managing director of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards' Los Angeles 
corporate finance group, said that although the volume of initial public 
offerings is down, he's seen a dramatic improvement in the quality of the 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood said small companies with good technology, a strong niche in the 
marketplace and a financial track record can attract investors in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have decided to take the plunge, finding the right investment banker 
to represent your company is critical. Your bankers not only must be skilled at 
executing the technical aspects of an initial public offering, but they also 
must have the credibility to market your company to the investment community. 
</P>
<P>
You will be asked to help prepare an attractive and informative presentation to 
create awareness of your company on Wall Street. The presentation describes the 
products or services your firm offers, and it provides a company's history, 
strategy and financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of an initial public offering is critical. If the stock market is 
down or fluctuating wildly, it's usually best to wait before entering the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Most initial public offerings are designed to raise $10 million or more, 
according to investment bankers. In most cases, one million shares is the 
minimum needed to create a viable, liquid market for your company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
According to Crowell, Weedon's Harrigian, the offering price of the stock must 
be tailored to the potential investor. A range of $8 to $10 a share is a good 
target for retail investors, he said. Before setting the share price, the 
advisers will compare prices on the stocks of similar businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Harrigian said that based on a hypothetical $10-million offering, a company 
should be prepared to spend as much as $300,000 on accounting, auditing and 
legal fees. The printing costs can run as high as $125,000 for the voluminous 
material required by the government and the stockbrokers who will be selling 
your stock. 
</P>
<P>
Because potential investors require a detailed financial history of your firm, 
investment bankers suggest that even the smallest company should prepare 
audited financial statements from the beginning. These reports are very 
complicated and expensive to produce if they must be recreated from past 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Small-business owners who relish their privacy should also consider the added 
pressures of life in a fishbowl. In addition to answering questions from 
shareholders and the financial press, there are strict government regulations 
that public companies must follow. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC, which monitors all publicly traded companies, requires companies to 
file an annual financial report and statement of financial condition called a 
10-K. Companies also need to file a quarterly financial report called a 10-Q. 
And any significant change, such as a resignation of a director or purchase of 
a major asset, must be submitted on an 8-Q form. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you can handle the financial and technical aspects of going public, you 
must consider the emotional issues surrounding the loss of control. For many 
entrepreneurs, delegating power and authority is a major challenge. Being 
financially solid and growing is only one requirement for going public. You 
must also build a strong management team and create a well-respected outside 
board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TIPS ON GOING PUBLIC 
</P>
<P>
Here are some pointers from experts for those considering taking their small 
businesses public: 
</P>
<P>
Spend the money to get audited financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
Always launch an initial public offering from a position of strength. Don't go 
public when you are desperate for money. 
</P>
<P>
Seek the best possible professional advice. 
</P>
<P>
Ask your legal and financial advisers if they might take stock instead of cash 
as payment for their services. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure you are ready to relinquish management control of the company you 
have built. 
</P>
<P>
Be prepared to deal with the public and government scrutiny of every aspect of 
your operation. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure you are ready to focus on quarterly performance to satisfy your 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Hire an impressive management team and create the strongest possible outside 
board.

CHINESE REASSURE FOREIGN FIRMS ON NATIONALIZATION; 
</P>
<P>
FAR EAST: CHINA WILL CHANGE ITS LAW TO SPECIFICALLY GUARANTEE THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WON'T SEIZE FOREIGN PROPERTY FROM JOINT VENTURES.

<P>
The Chinese government announced Thursday that it would amend a law on joint 
ventures, providing foreigners with some guarantees against a sudden 
nationalization or confiscation of their property. 
</P>
<P>
Although the move is designed to lure foreign investment and expertise, foreign 
businessmen say the primary stumbling blocks to more overseas business -- 
concerns over China's political and economic climate -- are still in place. 
</P>
<P>
The government's announcement trailed President Bush's move to lift a ban on 
financing U.S. exports to China. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily said Thursday that the National People's Congress will amend 
the law on joint ventures to specifically guarantee that the government would 
not nationalize or confiscate foreign property in joint projects. 
</P>
<P>
The motion was made apparently to woo new foreign money, which stopped coming 
in as overseas concerns adopted a wait-and-see attitude after China's bloody 
crackdown on student protesters in June. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very welcome step," said a foreign businessman. "But it obviously 
does not remove all of our concerns." 
</P>
<P>
The draft revision, expected to be adopted at parliament's session next year, 
would, however, allow confiscation under special circumstances but with 
"appropriate compensation." 
</P>
<P>
The amendment would also end restrictions on how long joint ventures may 
operate in China and would, for the first time, allow foreign partners to name 
the company chairman. 
</P>
<P>
These are important concessions that foreign businessmen were seeking even 
before the June massacre in Beijing's Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
"But," said a foreign legal specialist, "businessmen are looking at the 
political climate now, not just the fine-tuning of these laws." 
</P>
<P>
The existing equity joint venture law, passed in 1979 as part of a wider 
economic reform, ensured that the state would protect joint ventures but did 
not specifically rule out nationalization. 
</P>
<P>
Wholly owned foreign concerns have obtained guarantees against nationalization 
under Chinese law, and a bilateral treaty with Japan has extended additional 
protection to Japanese investors. 
</P>
<P>
"This (the planned amendment) is a symbolic move," said John Frisbie of the 
U.S.-China Business Council in Beijing. "It would help reassure investors about 
China's intentions." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Bush announced a decision to waive prohibitions on new loans, 
credit guarantees, insurance, and reinsurance deals from the U.S Export-Import 
Bank to back American exports to China. The bans had been imposed in reaction 
to the Chinese government's crackdown on the fledgling pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's move appeared to be aimed at boosting U.S. exports to China, but the 
going may be tough, businessmen say. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to cool once red-hot inflation, China tightened import rules and 
credit, making it harder for Chinese companies to find cash to buy foreign 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
"Business is slow," said a U.S. businessman. "China is just not spending its 
money now." 
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of 1989, U.S. exports to China totalled $4.5 billion, 
up 23.6% from the same 1988 period, according to U.S. statistics. Badly needed 
agricultural goods accounted for much of the rise. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. imports from China climbed 41.1% to $8.58 billion during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen said a key factor in the recovery of the China market would be 
resumed lending by the World Bank, which also suspended new credits to China 
after June. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers said commercial banks will be reluctant to offer new credit until then. 
</P>
<P>
Some European diplomats speculated the resumption of loans by the U.S. 
Export-Import Bank was economically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically Bush's initiative was intended as a safeguard against U.S. 
companies' losing out on major Chinese capital expenditure projects," said a 
Western diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
The move caught other industrialized nations off guard, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States has gone out in front on this one," said a European 
diplomat. "Some countries are angry at not being informed about it. But I 
should think they will follow suit soon."

SMALL BUSINESS: A CLEVELAND TOY FIRM TAPS A CHILD'S IMAGINATION WITH KITS TO 
TURN OLD BOXES AND SAFETY PINS INTO CARS OR DOLLHOUSES OR BRACELETS.

<P>
In an age of Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles and Nintendo, two women who started 
a toy company in their basement have created a growing business that relies on 
an endless source of entertainment -- a child's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Brody and Evelyn Greenwald, owners of Creative Art Activities Inc., 
banked on children's curiosity and ingenuity when they founded Creativity for 
Kids in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"So many of the other toys are entertaining you. . . . With our toys, rather 
than a child being passive, they participate," said Brody, 53, a former social 
worker. "People go into one of the toy supermarkets and buy what the kids say 
they want from television ads rather than buying something that is more in line 
with the kids' interests." 
</P>
<P>
The idea has paid off. The business has moved into a Cleveland warehouse as 
sales have increased 30% to 40% each of the last five years. The two Cleveland 
Heights owners say it is accurate to estimate that sales exceeded $2 million in 
1989, though they decline to give specific sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
The company's 40 kits contain materials to transform old boxes into cars or 
dollhouses, safety pins and sequins into bracelets and cardboard tubes and 
clothespins into dolls, puppets and monsters. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Guckert, publisher of Playthings, the New York-based trade magazine 
founded in 1903 for the toy industry, said Creativity for Kids has carved out a 
special niche in the toy market. 
</P>
<P>
"Creativity for Kids is excellent," Guckert said. "We call them specialty 
retailers. The two gals have researched the market and their company is strong. 
There are a lot of companies in this differentiated market that are not." 
</P>
<P>
The company's products have won seven Parents' Choice awards, a toy industry 
award for excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the kits are just a collection of household items, the kind of stuff 
parents used to assemble for play on a rainy day -- feathers, glue, colored 
paper, corks, paint, fabric, wood and yarn, said Greenwald, 49, a lawyer. She 
said the kits satisfy the needs of working parents who don't have the time to 
round up craft items but still want to offer children creative opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Ten employees work at company headquarters, mailing orders to about 1,000 small 
toy shops nationwide that feature educational and specialty products. 
</P>
<P>
The employees order hundreds of pounds of feathers, millions of wiggly eyes, 
pine cones and an array of other items. The suppliers ship the items to a 
sheltered workshop program where handicapped workers assemble the toy kits. 
</P>
<P>
Aimed at children 4 and older, the kits range in price from $3 for a party 
favors kit to $25 for a pre-cut doll bed. The product line is inexpensive in an 
industry with annual sales of $12 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The kits are a combination of facts, playing and learning. They make up their 
own rules -- no one tells them how to do it," Brody said. 
</P>
<P>
For $7.95, the Let's Pretend Travel Kit includes maps, passports, postcards and 
tickets. The Let's Pretend Restaurant offers dinnerware, menus, place mats, 
order pads and other items needed for a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Other kits include the ingredients to make a personalized T-shirt, hat or masks 
or items to operate a hotel or supermarket.

<P>
FASHION: DESIGNER RACHEL LONDON HAS CAPTIVATED JAPANESE INVESTORS. SHE JOINS A 
GROWING LIST OF AMERICANS WHO'VE DONE SO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You can catch Los Angeles fashion designer Rachel London's styles in an exhibit 
at the Louvre next year. Or turn on MTV right now and view one of her 
body-hugging "flower power" outfits in LL Cool J's music video "Big Ole Butt." 
</P>
<P>
Here in Los Angeles, you can visit Rachel London's Garden, the designer's 
eye-popping boutique on Melrose Avenue. The store has become known as a spot 
that provides celebrity provocateurs such as Madonna, Lisa Bonet and Sandra 
Bernhard with clothes to wear on television. (When Bernhard appeared on "Late 
Night With David Letterman," he looked at her dress and asked, "Is it 
flameproof?") 
</P>
<P>
But if you really want to take in the full spectrum of London's typically 
flower-laden designs, the best bet may be to wait a while and check out what 
happens when there's some real money behind her work. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, she's still self-financed. But sometime next year, the Japanese 
are expected to begin marketing her unique and ebullient sense of style in 
their country. 
</P>
<P>
According to London, her Asian investors have big plans for her. They want to 
open a store filled with her playful designs and model it after her totally 
unorthodox Los Angeles boutique -- complete with a bed as the store's 
centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
London has joined a growing list of unlikely young American designers whose 
names are not yet household words in the United States -- or anywhere else -- 
but whose talents have nonetheless caught the eye of Japanese investors. They 
want to set these promising names up with boutiques in Japan, even though they 
may not have any financial backers or stores of their own at home. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when London signed to do business with a Japanese firm (which she has 
agreed not to name until the store opens), she had no plans to open her own 
shop and was content to wholesale her collection to department stores and 
boutiques, which sold the clothes that retail in the $200-to-$300 range. 
</P>
<P>
Now the designer has visions of her eccentric boutique on a busy street in 
Kyoto. When it opens, it is likely to have all the trappings of her 
second-floor Melrose store. There, shoppers walk up posy-laden stairs. (London 
lined them with poinsettia lights usually found on Christmas trees and riveted 
silk wildflowers into the carpet so it looks as if the path has been strewn 
with flowers.) 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, visitors get a glimpse of London's kitchen (decorated with rainbow 
paint and more flowers). Finally, there's the shop-apartment's main room, in 
which the ceiling is nearly as striking as the bed -- it's completely laced 
with delicate silk magnolia blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
Near the window looking out on Melrose are white Victorian lawn chairs covered 
with what London calls "flower fur" (flowers jammed together to create a stole 
of endless petals). The chairs enthrone two large Snoopy dolls, for which 
London has created floral outfits much like those she designs for humans. (The 
dolls and their costumes are her ticket to being exhibited in the Louvre next 
year; she's been asked to participate in a show commemorating Snoopy's 40th 
birthday.) 
</P>
<P>
The Carmen Miranda of Melrose reports that her investors have been taking lots 
of photographs and measuring things exactly, with plans to reproduce the store 
faithfully. 
</P>
<P>
Her marketing agent, Steve Feinberg, director of ITM Corp., a Torrance-based 
firm that consults on Japan-U.S. trade, explains: "The idea is to give the 
Japanese consumer the look and the feeling that they're walking into Rachel 
London's Garden just as it is on Melrose." 
</P>
<P>
Feinberg, who met London through a mutual friend in Los Angeles a little over a 
year ago, thinks that London's exuberantly sexy interpretation of '60s 
flower-power styles is ideal for the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
"I immediately thought (London's look) was exotic enough," he recalls. "There's 
a niche in the Japanese mind-set that just loves the flavor of exotica that 
Rachel has. The Japanese are attracted to something that's unique and Western 
in flavor." 
</P>
<P>
At the opposite extreme of the design spectrum, New York-based classicist 
Carmelo Pomodoro had his first boutique opened for him this past October, in 
Tokyo, not Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes called a "New Age Calvin Klein," Pomodoro was set up with a sleek, 
ultramodern "neo-Palladian style" shop, "an absolute showcase" that he helped 
the architect design. The store is expected to be the first in a series and was 
financed by Takashimaya, a leading Japanese retail chain. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have a reputation for taking things and improving them," Pomodoro 
says. "But now, they are going to the original source of talent and becoming 
partners with it -- instead of buying it outright or trying to redo it 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Like London, he has been popular with the U.S. fashion press though his name 
may not yet be well-known to most consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Pomodoro sees the increasing sophistication of Japanese customers as 
responsible for the trend to U.S.-Japanese design partnerships that result in 
stores: "The customer in Japan has gotten very savvy. She doesn't want the 
Japanese version of Hermes or Chanel. She wants the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
Kazuto Taniguchi, manager of Takashimaya's New York office, says his retail 
chain "was looking for a young, aggressive designer, not a big name like Bill 
Blass or Geoffrey Beene" when it found Pomodoro. "We were looking for a 
partner. We want to grow with him." 
</P>
<P>
Taniguchi points out that not long ago, Japanese firms would purchase the 
rights to market foreign designer's names, but use a Japanese designer to 
interpret the work for the Japanese customer. 
</P>
<P>
In Pomodoro's case, the interpretive changes are minimal. For example, he's 
adding color options. 
</P>
<P>
"I want him (Pomodoro) to keep close to his own (American) line," Taniguchi 
says of the designer's sporty but unadorned collections. "The Japanese people 
have been all over the world. They know everything that's going on. They want 
the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
Some American designers with successful boutiques in Japan no longer market 
their wares in the States. Los Angeles-based Gregory Poe, for instance, has 16 
boutiques throughout Japan, but none of the clothing is sold here. 
</P>
<P>
Poe has been working with the Japanese for about 10 years, ever since buyers 
for a Japanese store spotted some of his accessories, encasing such things as 
toys and plastic fish, at Macy's in New York. According to Poe, the buyers were 
so enamored of his work that they bought up all of Macy's stock (at retail 
prices), shipped it to Japan and brought Poe to the country as a rising star. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they saw something in me they didn't get in other designers," he 
explains. "And they loved the lineage." (Poe is a third-generation Californian 
and says he is related to Edgar Allen Poe.) 
</P>
<P>
Though he admits he's had to dilute his fashion statements somewhat for the 
conservative tastes of his Japanese customers, Poe is generally delighted with 
the way things have worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"Every backer I dealt with in the United States was such a charlatan and hadn't 
the faintest idea of how to run a business," he says, recalling the days when 
his line was carried in trendy Western boutiques. "A designer really should be 
specifically designing and not having to tell a manufacturer how to run a 
business." 
</P>
<P>
In certain cases, Japanese marketing specialists have admired American 
retailing style-setters so much that they have encouraged them to invent 
clothing lines where none existed. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Charivari of New York. The name has long been associated with a 
distinctive approach to merchandising. Each of the six stores in New York is 
completely different, but they all carry high-style goods from leading 
designers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
None of the stores, however, carried its own in-house line of clothing -- until 
the Japanese suggested the idea. Charivari owner Thelma Weiser and her 
family-member partners now create a line of men's wear for Charivari shops in 
Japan only. The second of their stores opened there earlier this month in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Mendenhall, the chain's men's wear buyer, says: "In Japan right now, 
there's a high demand for American merchandise. What they liked about Charivari 
was the strong image. Even though other stores in the world buy some of the 
same collections we do, I think it's the point of view with which we present 
them that made Charivari appealing to the Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
Why the Japanese penchant for American names that haven't really caught on in 
the United States? 
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of Anthony Paul, editor-in-chief of Business Tokyo, Japan's 
leading international business magazine, part of the reason may be that these 
relatively unfamiliar names are desirable because of their growth potential. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very possible that these non-names will become big names. What the 
Japanese might be doing is making a forecast," says Paul. "They see a potential 
winner and they're tying up to it so that when it does make its mark in the 
United States, they'll be well situated to take advantage of it over there. 
Also, price is a consideration. They can get it cheap before it's a big-time 
name.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: ACCORD TOPS ITSELF FOR 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Old trivia: In 1972, the 15,007,034th Volkswagen bug was built, and the marque 
overtook Ford's Model T as the best-selling car in automotive history. The 
crass might note that a Tin Lizzie was about the only thing a Beetle could 
overtake. 
</P>
<P>
New minutiae: Ford is battling back. Since 1980, the company has sold 7.2 
million Escorts, and currently this somewhat unpoetic vehicle is the world's 
most popular car. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in second place and quietly closing -- with Volkswagen sadly lolling in the 
back seat awaiting some future automotive Armageddon -- comes the Honda Accord. 
</P>
<P>
It was introduced in 1976. More than 5 million Accords have rolled worldwide 
since then. And its annual sales in the United States are wheel-to-wheel with 
Ford's Escort. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, I can't think of any other car that has had it together like 
the Accord has had it together, for the number of years it has," said Gerald 
Bengtson, vice president of marketing for American Honda Motor Co. of Gardena. 
He was talking of the harmony of Accord. 
</P>
<P>
"Other people have had problems (in the first year) and then did things to 
improve their cars," Bengtson continued. "But no one has really put the 
complete package out there from Day 1 and continued to improve upon it." 
</P>
<P>
A result of that, he added, was an initial corps of satisfied owners that has 
become a legion loyal to one generation of Accords after the other. 
</P>
<P>
The net result is the 1990 Honda Accord. 
</P>
<P>
It not only follows but also tops its own tough act as the most refined amalgam 
of pleasing function and mechanical achievement -- and transportation as 
trustworthy as that 15,007,034th Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
Owen Edwards, author of "Elegant Solutions," which addresses objects of 
affection and the affection of objects, touches this precise nerve in noting 
our daily need for things to be "admirable and intelligent, generous and sound, 
functional and spiritual." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards could easily situate the Honda Accord alongside his selection of 
graceful functionaries: the dollar bill, Pears soap, the Talon zipper, the 
Zippo lighter, Oreo cookies, espadrilles, Clincher softballs and the Buck 
folding knife. 
</P>
<P>
The Accord is a car of great styling because it is simplicity born of the 
gentle nondescript of previous generations. Nothing schmancy. Nice lines and 
flares and rake of glass. Just nice. 
</P>
<P>
Yet . . . underneath, clearly sniffing for the sport coupe driver who presumes 
to own every entrance ramp and interesting corner between you and Century City, 
is a virile engine producing a capable 130 horsepower. That's quite enough to 
bring smoke and alley cat wails from the front tires but sedate enough to 
suggest total respectability if called to school meetings and teacher-parent 
admonitions are suspected. 
</P>
<P>
Accord prices for six models range from $12,000 to $17,000, and in this decade 
of the $1 panhandle, that's close to giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
Yet . . . the sticker price on the majority of Accords includes such 
pleasantries as variable assist power steering, air conditioning, a 
medium-quality stereo system, cruise control and power windows, locks and side 
mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
Would that this list of attachments and mechanical advantages was impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the rapid transition of air bags and anti-lock brake systems from 
luxury options to standard equipment on many cars, the wonderful Accord comes 
with neither small wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, its brakes are an antiquated disc-drum setup, and the federal 
government's 1990 passive-restraint requirements are met by irritating, 
motorized shoulder straps that seduce even the responsible into forgetting the 
seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
Bengtson says it is not oversight, just a matter of cost. 
</P>
<P>
A driver-side air bag and anti-lock brakes on the Accord, he estimated, would 
cost $1,500. That might be considered small change to anyone thumbing out 
$50,000 for a Mercedes -- but it represents a 10% price hike to Honda buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than impose that premium ("a grand here or there on a $12,000 car will 
make or break a deal"), Bengtson said, Honda is examining ways of reducing 
production costs to find price room "so we can include these features (air bags 
and anti-lock brakes) in future models." 
</P>
<P>
"It is not going to be this year, and it may not be in total next year. But it 
could be by 1992," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new Accord is longer, lower and wider than last year's sibling. The extra 
length allows a sportier slope to the windshield and rear window. The 
additional length and width combined with Honda's multiple-link suspension 
system and rigid unibody construction also flattens the ride and the 
discomforts of dip, roll and watching your Ray-Bans slide the length of the 
dashboard on their lenses. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of lenses . . . since carbide lamps first parted the dark, headlight 
glass has always focused and directed the night vision of automobiles. In this 
year's Honda Accord, the lenses are no more than clear covers because segmented 
reflectors concentrate and control the light. 
</P>
<P>
The system allows more efficient, lower profile lights to blend permanently 
with frontal lines rather than shattering them with great, staring pop-up 
headlights. 
</P>
<P>
There's a further example of Honda's technological talent in the installation 
of twin engine shafts, mounted parallel to the crankshaft, that counter-rotate 
to cancel the inertial forces, that is, vibration created by the movement of 
the pistons and connecting rods. 
</P>
<P>
Add a five-speed (four-speed automatics are available throughout the series) 
that's already in the Gearbox Hall of Fame for smoothness and heft, and you 
have a decorum of drive train that is quantum leaps ahead of any car in 
Accord's class. 
</P>
<P>
Now round out the mechanical package with an efficient, albeit elderly braking 
system, and nifty, highly communicative steering. This combination of engine, 
transmission and steering will tame inefficiencies among the unknowing and, for 
the willing driver, will refresh precision and skills faster than the sight of 
a CHP cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
The same sedate efficiency of the Accord's exterior is carried into its cabin, 
where the control layout is familiar and seats (particularly the fronts with 
adjustable lumbar support) are so comfortable that they are barely noticed. 
</P>
<P>
It is roomier, particularly in the rear half, than last year's model and wears 
more glass. Vision is omnidirectional. The decor is unobtrusive fabrics, vinyls 
and plastics with only one horror -- a veneer of velour that makes door panels 
appear to be upholstered in kiwi fruit. 
</P>
<P>
The overall pleasure, however, is the abundance owners will receive for the 
relatively small amount they have to pay. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the Accord EX offers only one factory option -- for anyone 
willing to splurge $80 on floor mats.

'CIVILIZATION' MAY SPELL THE END FOR THE WORLD'S LAST FRONTIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TIOM, Indonesia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The single-engine Cessna belonging to U. S.-based Missionary Aviation 
Fellowship banked sharply as a forest-covered mountain loomed ahead. Then a 
balding grass airstrip appeared and pilot Rick Willms set the tiny plane down 
with practiced, though heart-stopping, skill. 
</P>
<P>
As the plane thundered to a halt, a crowd of people converged on the end of the 
runway to watch curiously. About half of them wore no clothes: Some women had 
grass skirts and some men wore a cylindrical gourd called a koteka. Despite 
their nakedness, a few carried umbrellas. Others wore black plastic bags like 
hats. 
</P>
<P>
Seven thousand feet above sea level, the small village of Tiom is set in a 
spectacular mountain valley. The checkerboard patterns of gardens growing sweet 
potatoes rise dizzyingly up the side of cliffs so steep that it is not uncommon 
for women working there to fall to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
As a visitor raised a camera to photograph the scene around Willms' plane, 
people in the crowd simultaneously raised a forefinger. By silent consensus, 
the fee for a photograph is now 100 rupiahs (about 4 cents) per person. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of tourists through here these days," explained Alan Speakman, an 
Australian missionary whose brown clapboard house overlooks the steep runway. 
</P>
<P>
These are the highlands of Irian Jaya, a place that many people -- 
anthropologists, missionaries and government officials -- regard as the world's 
last frontier. 
</P>
<P>
A sizable number of people in Irian, whose interior was not explored or shown 
on a map until 50 years ago, still dwell in the Stone Age. 
</P>
<P>
But after millennia of isolation, the 20th Century is now making rapid inroads 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Lying at the eastern end of the sprawling Indonesian archipelago, Irian Jaya is 
as far from the capital, Jakarta, as Los Angeles is from Washington, but far 
more remote. 
</P>
<P>
It has a population of 1.5 million spread over a bird-shaped territory the size 
of California. The region varies from the only year-round glacier in the 
tropics to malaria-infested swamps along the coast. Irian Jaya is the western 
half of New Guinea, the second largest island in the world after Greenland. 
</P>
<P>
For Indonesia, Irian Jaya represents a vast storehouse of natural resources: 
oil, a mountain made of copper, and timber forests as far as the eye can see. 
Such resources will be increasingly in demand for exploitation as the country's 
current sources of revenues, principally oil, run out over the next few 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
"We must speed up development," said Irian's governor, Barnabas Suebu, "but we 
also need to take care to preserve our original culture." 
</P>
<P>
Irian Jaya also represents a political headache for Jakarta, as a tiny but 
influential separatist movement called the Free Papua Movement, armed 
principally with bows and arrows, continues to agitate for independence. 
</P>
<P>
To the more than 200 missionaries in Irian Jaya, the province represents the 
ultimate test of faith on the edge of the world. With the missionaries have 
come education, medicine and a slow acceptance of Christian values in a country 
that is the world's most populous Muslim state. 
</P>
<P>
For the anthropologists, Irian Jaya stands like a remarkable textbook: people 
speaking 250 distinct languages who still chop trees with sharpened stones and 
yet can remember ancestors dating back eight generations. There are people in 
Irian Jaya who until 10 years ago did not know there was an outside world, who 
count in base 27, as opposed to 10, using elbows and ears, but have never seen 
a wheel. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to bring "civilization" to Irian have brought mixed success. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago the government decided the people would always be backward 
without clothes, so it launched Operation Koteka, dropping jogging shorts from 
the air to remote villages. The villagers promptly put the shorts on their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
One missionary in Jayapura, the provincial capital, said his group is now 
actively discouraging the wearing of clothes because the people had not been 
properly prepared for the change; there was an epidemic of skin diseases 
because many wore the clothes without ever washing them. 
</P>
<P>
The remote villagers have recently been introduced to a cash economy for the 
first time, and, according to missionaries, have become avid consumers, 
especially prizing such items as portable radios and wristwatches. 
</P>
<P>
But they have little to sell at the markets; in the highlands, for example, the 
Dani people prize their ability to raise pigs, but the townspeople are 
overwhelmingly Muslims who do not eat pork. 
</P>
<P>
The people are agonizingly innocent. 
</P>
<P>
One missionary recalled that a villager had approached him to change $2,000 
that he said he had earned by catering to American tourists for several weeks. 
The villager then presented a wad of Monopoly play money. 
</P>
<P>
While the missionaries generally are credited with stopping endemic tribal 
wars, cannibalism and the ritual killing of widows and newborn girls, 
anthropologists are beginning to wonder if the missionary process is leading to 
the destruction of Irian culture. One Western expert on primitive art lamented 
that many local artifacts had been burned by missionaries in the conversion 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of what the missionaries are doing is debatable," said Angel Niesje 
Manembu, an Australian-educated anthropologist. "For example, they learn the 
local language, but it's also a way of maintaining control because the 
missionaries become the people's only contact with the outside world." 
</P>
<P>
The government and outsiders face enormous obstacles in their efforts to bring 
modern life to Irian Jaya. There are few roads in the interior -- a Trans-Irian 
Highway is now slated for completion sometime in the 21st Century -- so all 
goods must be flown in. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Irian Jaya was a strategic air base in World War II, occupied first by 
the Japanese and then by Allied forces. Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur kept his 
headquarters at Jayapura for two crucial years and the remains of landing craft 
and tanks still litter the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The reliance on aircraft has spawned a number of "cargo cults," the belief by 
Irianese natives that white people have magical powers or know "the secret" 
where all goods are stored. So central is the role played by the airplane that 
some groups in the isolated highlands believe that everything that has arrived 
by plane, from tractors to house cats, have the same magic powers and can fly 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the transportation to remote interior villages is still provided by 
missionary organizations. The Mission Aviation Fellowship and two other groups 
are the only means to reach about 250 remote airstrips. The government has 
neither the planes nor the pilots skilled in making treacherous landings and 
willing to work for low pay. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the stations would have to close without these air services," said J. 
Melvin Isaac, a pilot from Manhattan Beach who has been flying here for 21 
years. "We're pilots and technicians, not reverends." 
</P>
<P>
Adds pilot David Marfleet, a former British army paratrooper who flew 
helicopters in Northern Ireland: "In some places I fly to, I am the only white 
man they see from one month to the next. The cardinal sin is to forget the mail 
bag." 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma posed by so-called civilization was illustrated in October, when an 
earthquake hit the region around Soba, killing more than 120 people in 
landslides, according to official accounts. The government then announced that 
between 2,000 and 3,500 people remaining in the area would be moved by 
helicopter to a new region out of the range of future earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Missionary groups in the Soba area denounced the move, saying that the people 
who had lived for generations at 6,000 feet had no immunity to malaria, which 
was endemic in the new area. Even a government doctor sent to the new site had 
come down with the disease after a few days, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We must be concerned," Suebu said in an interview. "If this new village 
succeeds, other people will move down the mountain to these fertile areas. If 
not, I think everyone will move back to their old village." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tigor Sudjito, the health director for the highlands' Baliem Valley, noted 
that the single largest medical problem in the area stems from the breathing of 
smoke fires that the people leave burning in their house through the night to 
keep them warm and repel mosquitoes. Yet attempts to change the practice have 
been unsuccessful, he said, and the life expectancy is still only 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
"While the people in the Baliem Valley outwardly seem to be assimilating 
Western ways such as wearing clothes, they really are privately resisting," 
said anthropologist Niesje Manembu. "Among the people, belief in magic is still 
very strong." 
</P>
<P>
Other than the missionaries, the most pervasive influence in the remote towns 
of Irian Jaya is the Indonesian government. Elementary schools, often staffed 
by teachers from faraway Java, have been set up at virtually every mission 
station, with the government flying in bags of rice to its employees. 
</P>
<P>
As Sudjito noted, the highlands of Irian Jaya are considered an extreme 
hardship post by most Javanese. Teachers and doctors receive no extra pay, 
although the cost of living is many times higher than in low-lying areas. As a 
result, the government has trouble attracting qualified staff. 
</P>
<P>
The schools have brought a common Indonesian language to the province, where 
the barrier of tribal language, despite intermarriage, had made commerce 
difficult. Including the 770 tongues spoken in neighboring Papua New Guinea, 
the island contains one-fifth of the world's known languages. 
</P>
<P>
The school system has caused the population to shift heavily toward the towns, 
as parents seek more advanced education for their children. Irianese complain 
that the system of education often has little revelance to the people, teaching 
world history and reading books about trains with people who know sweet 
potatoes and pigs. 
</P>
<P>
Another government presence is the police, who attempt to maintain order among 
the different tribes, which have been warring for hundreds of years. They have 
also been placed in the towns to prevent the rise of the Free Papua Movement, 
although Western diplomats in Jakarta doubt that the group has more than 100 
hard-core supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Irian Jaya, formerly a Dutch colony, was occupied by Indonesian troops in 1962. 
A year later, Indonesia was awarded the administration of Irian by the United 
Nations and in 1968 the government organized a meeting of chiefs to comply with 
U. N. demands for a free election to confirm the mandate. 
</P>
<P>
In September, an American-trained lawyer, Tom Wainggai, was sentenced to 20 
years in prison for raising a New Guinea flag during a soccer game. The 
government announced that the leader of the Free Guinea Movement has 
surrendered to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Vigilance is still needed to maintain stability as a condition for developing 
Irian Jaya," said the provincial military commander, Gen. Abinowo, who, like 
many Indonesians, goes by only one name. 
</P>
<P>
While the separatist movement has few hard-core followers, officials in 
Jayapura acknowledge that there is growing resentment in the province about the 
number of non-Irianese Indonesians who hold key jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"The local people are losing their chance; they don't have the skills of 
outsiders," said Tony Rahawarin, director of the Irian Jaya Rural Community 
Development Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most controversial campaigns to develop Irian Jaya is a national 
program called Transmigration, in which farmers are moved from the crowded 
sections of overpopulated Java thousands of miles away to homestead farms in 
remote areas such as those along Irian Jaya's border with neighboring Papua New 
Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
The program's results have been decidedly mixed: Some Transmigration 
communities near the port of Merauke in southern Irian Jaya have had no water 
for half the year and are so remote from markets that they have no place to 
sell their produce. 
</P>
<P>
While Transmigration has been more successful in the north, the government has 
scaled back the program from 25,000 families in the last four years to just 400 
new families this year. It says it now needs to spend money to develop existing 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
Some Irianese are demanding equal money to develop their towns as well as 
Transmigration areas. There is also an increasing clamor for the central 
government to return to the province more of the money earned as the result of 
oil and mining concessions. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand our weaknesses," said a local planning official. "Growth has no 
impact if the local people are neglected and left in the same situation."

TEACHER FINDS SCIENCE FAIR A METAPHOR FOR 5TH-GRADERS' LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY KIDDER, Tracy Kidder graduated from Harvard, studied at the University 
of Iowa and served as an Army officer in Vietnam. He is a Pulitzer 
Prize-winning author whose previous books include Soul of the New Machine and 
House. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At the beginning of May, the Science Fair loomed for all of the fifth-grade 
classes at Kelly School. According to the rules, the children could form teams 
of their own choosing or work alone. Each team or child would choose a topic, 
such as dinosaurs or water power. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, each would construct a demonstration, to fit on a table in one of the 
gyms for the climactic event, the fair itself. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the plan was to get parents involved. Chris sent home letters, in 
English on one side and in Spanish on the other, asking that the parents help 
their children with the demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Every day during May, Chris gave her students an hour or more to get ready for 
the fair. 
</P>
<P>
Many early signs weren't good. 
</P>
<P>
During an early rehearsal, Kimberly, who teamed up with Courtney, told Chris, 
"We're gonna put these foods on the table and tell 'em what the things are. 
</P>
<P>
"OK. You have foods on your table," said Chris to the two girls. "Someone comes 
by at the fair. What are you going to tell them?" 
</P>
<P>
"Like, this is a potato?" said Kimberly. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's going to know what a potato is!" said Chris. 
</P>
<P>
"Like what foods nourish your body?" said Courtney hopefully. 
</P>
<P>
Chris questioned the team of Irene and Mariposa. "Are you just going to have a 
bunch of rocks in front of you?" 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get a lot of rocks from around my house," said Irene. "And 
figure out their environment. Like whether they came from a desert. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Their environment? Rocks don't have an environment, and I doubt any around 
your house came from a desert." Chris' eyes got very wide. "You're going to 
have to be more specific." 
</P>
<P>
But there were exceptions, and the most exceptional was Claude. 
</P>
<P>
Chris was astonished. Claude joined up with Pedro and Jimmy. 
</P>
<P>
Chris had to insist that Claude's partners do some of the work. Claude was 
clearly the leader. She asked the three boys to describe their project, and 
Claude piped up: "It's gonna be like on streams and rivers and how they form. 
How they move." Talking fast, shaking a hand furiously, Claude described all 
this while Chris ran her tongue around the inside of her mouth, suppressing her 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very good, Claude! I like what I'm hearing!" They were down in the 
library. Chris turned to the aide there and said, "Would you help these boys 
find some more books on streams and rivers?" 
</P>
<P>
"And ponds and lakes!" declared Claude. 
</P>
<P>
Later, she overheard Claude say to a classmate, "I'm gonna work on my science 
project every night!" The next week, he described again for Chris, in 
remarkable detail, the birth of rivers. 
</P>
<P>
To the class in general, Chris said, "I hope some of you are as well versed on 
your projects as Claude." 
</P>
<P>
For a moment, Chris wondered, "Did I really just say that?" 
</P>
<P>
This was the boy who, a month ago, when Mrs. Zajac was putting the heat on him, 
said he felt mixed up and wanted to go home. Now he raced around, making a 
chart for his project. The chart was incredibly neat. 
</P>
<P>
Among a generally disappointing bunch of written science reports, Claude's 
looked pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
High-pitched voices echoed in the gym. The end of May had arrived, and the fair 
had begun. The noise was like one unremitting, collective scream, which could 
only get worse, because to converse in the gym one had to add to the clamor by 
shouting. 
</P>
<P>
"Today," Chris predicted, "will be a four-Tylenol day." 
</P>
<P>
Chris decided to look at the projects from other classes first. She found a 
pretty good water wheel on one table. At the next table a boy from another 
class sat, looking hopeful, behind an exhibit that consisted of a rose, still 
encased in cellophane and planted in the top of an empty soda can. 
</P>
<P>
"What's your project on?" shouted Chris. She leaned across the table, cupping 
an ear to catch the reply. 
</P>
<P>
"Flowers," said the boy, nodding earnestly. 
</P>
<P>
She visited another boy, from another class, who said his project was on 
electricity. "It comes from plugs," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Chris felt a secret relief. She had awakened one night not long ago imagining 
children from other classes standing behind wonderful homemade rocket ships and 
expounding on physics, while her students explained to fair-goers, "This is a 
potato" and "These are rocks." 
</P>
<P>
Chris told herself now: "At least I don't feel too embarrassed. Mine aren't any 
worse than anyone else's." 
</P>
<P>
But then she stopped at Jorge's table, and her amusement began to wane. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge, from her low math group, often looked exhausted. He had tried to do a 
science project, a model of a laser made out of colored paper, an electric 
light, and a cardboard box. Jorge had gotten the idea from a book. He'd 
followed all the instructions, he told Mrs. Zajac. 
</P>
<P>
"But it doesn't work," he said. Jorge had been heard to say a few days before, 
"I can't get too much help at home." An understatement. The floors of his 
family's apartment were covered with their dog's excrement. He wore the same 
clothes day in and day out, and even now, standing across the table from him. 
Chris could smell the sad odor, like rotting fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Arnie's father had arrived. Chris smiled broadly. She extended her hand. 
Arnie's father clasped it shyly. Chris noticed that his pants were torn and 
dirty. An unmistakable, sweetish odor of liquor came from him. It was only 
about 10 in the morning. Chris visited Arnie's table. On it lay a store-bought 
example of an electric switch. Arnie smiled at her. 
</P>
<P>
Other parents had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
There, behind her homemade model of the solar system sat Arabella, smiling 
sweetly, looking chipper and healthy and confident, telling the judges all the 
names of the planets, their approximate distances from the sun, the main 
characteristics of each. 
</P>
<P>
And there, in his electrician's uniform, moving from table to table and 
correcting the mistaken notions of the various children who had done projects 
on electricity, was the explanation for the care behind Arabella's project and 
for the progress that Arabella had made this year -- Arabella's father. 
</P>
<P>
Alice's father wore a necktie and blue blazer. The team of Alice, Judith and 
Margaret had done electrical generation. Alice's father had taken them to the 
Holyoke water power plant a few days ago. Through a friend he'd arranged a 
special tour for the girls. Their display, a model town on a large piece of 
plywood, didn't show how power got generated, but it was the nicest-looking 
project in the gym. 
</P>
<P>
Chris questioned them. The girls knew their stuff. Chris chatted briefly with 
Alice's father. She thanked him for helping his daughter and her friends so 
much. 
</P>
<P>
She meant those words. 
</P>
<P>
But she couldn't look around the gym now without feeling sad. The children 
whose parents had come to the gym -- for the most part neatly dressed, 
confident-seeming adults -- had the best projects and knew the most about their 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the forlorn projects belonged to the children with no parents on 
hand, such as Courtney and Kimberly, who stood behind a table displaying a box 
of oatmeal, a hamburger bun, a piece of white 
</P>
<P>
bread, a carton of milk, an egg, two potatoes and a remnant of iceberg lettuce 
growing brown. 
</P>
<P>
Chris wished she could call a halt right now. 
</P>
<P>
The whole event looked like a rigged election, distressingly predictable, as if 
designed to teach the children about the unfairness of life. 
</P>
<P>
She saw one bright spot, though. There was some room in an unfair world for 
individual achievement. She walked up to Claude's table. 
</P>
<P>
She felt rescued from this day, for a brief time, when she looked at what 
Claude had done: on the table, his thorough and neat diagram of a river rising 
in mountains and flowing to the sea; and behind that, Claude's model river. He 
had built his model on a metal serving platter. Little stones were piled up at 
one end, from which a chute of aluminum foil descended, depicting a waterfall, 
which led to the river itself, which had banks described by more small stones 
and a bed of aquarium gravel, and water, too. 
</P>
<P>
In the water lay a little rubber crayfish and a little rubber fish, which if 
you squeezed it (as Claude would for fair-goers) spawned several smaller rubber 
fish from its nether end. She'd never dared to hope for this much from him. And 
the best was still to come. 
</P>
<P>
"All right, Claude," she shouted over the din, "tell me about rivers." 
</P>
<P>
And Claude, who for six months hadn't managed to complete more than a few 
homework assignments, delivered a lucid description, even better than during 
rehearsals, of the birth of rivers. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed to know enough to talk all morning. Chris had to move along. "OK," 
she said. "Thank you, Claude." 
</P>
<P>
Hazy sunlight filtered through the gym's high, frosted windows. The noise, 
sharp and concentrated, made her feel as if her hands were vibrating, like 
tuning forks. 
</P>
<P>
Chris looked around. Where was Robert? 
</P>
<P>
Robert had come to school this morning without his science project, saying that 
he had left it at a convenience store. The counselor had taken him to fetch the 
project. Chris had told Robert that when he got back, he should come down to 
the gym right away. But he was nowhere in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Chris sent Courtney back to the classroom to see if Robert was there. Courtney 
returned in a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Robert says he's not comin,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris lowered her eyebrows. "Oh, he isn't, is he."

<P>
Orange County Congressman C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) didn't wait to 
be asked by the media what he thought of the Panamanian invasion: He called 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The same was true for other elected officials who either transmitted their 
reactions over facsimile machines or had media liaisons pitch their bosses' 
reactions to newspapers, radio and TV, as the county's political figures 
scrambled onto the patriotic bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), known among his Sacramento 
legislative colleagues as "Rambo," bypassed the media and went right to the 
source: President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"I sent him a telegram," Ferguson said proudly. "I let him know I supported his 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Most elected officials in Orange County are Republican, and none has publicly 
challenged Bush's action. Some, like Orange County Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates, 
called on U.S. citizens to understand the difficulties that American soldiers 
face as they try to find and arrest former Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"Citizens have to remember that when somebody here in the United States sells 
dope in our neighborhoods, or to our kids, you don't know where they are or 
where they live," Gates said. "It's a problem for law enforcement. It takes 
time, and I'm confident the U.S. will find (Noriega). But the American people 
should not look at that as an easy task." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez strongly endorsed the President's actions but said 
he hopes that U.S. troops don't become involved in a long-term occupation of 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Many Orange County officials said the only thing standing in the way of a total 
military success is the failure to capture Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just sorry we didn't get him yet," said Assemblywoman Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress). "I think as long as Noriega is on the loose, he can rally 
guerrilla warfare." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder: "There was no other course of action we could 
have taken to protect the Americans in Panama, the Panama Canal and our 
interests there from that bully Noriega. He pushed us into action. . . . If 
Noriega is captured the President will be a hero." 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Vice Chairman Don R. Roth said he regrets that the 
military action began just before Christmas because he remembers how important 
the holidays were during the 20 years he served in the Navy. "It's tough but it 
has to be done. . . . When you are called to do it you do it." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Gates said the U.S. troops are "heroes who should be treated like 
heroes when they arrive home." 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of Noriega's U.S. indictment for his alleged involvement in 
international drug trading, Gates said, "I want to see a crooked Noriega in 
jail where he belongs." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, a former Marine Corps lieutenant colonel, is very public about having 
fought in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"All the do-gooders say, 'Oh we assassinated somebody and we shouldn't have. 
But public opinion in America will no longer allow this country to act on 
behalf of its own self-interests," Ferguson said. "The president had to extend 
diplomacy and that meant, in this case, force." 
</P>
<P>
While there was support for Bush, elected officials differed on how long U.S. 
troops should occupy the Panamanian capital. Vasquez said that "our presence 
should be eliminated as quickly as possible after the new government is 
operating." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone had Panama on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Parriott, an administrative assistant for Assemblyman John R. Lewis, 
(R-Orange), said "no one" brought the subject up during an open house at Lewis' 
office that attracted several hundred constituents Wednesday night.

MASTERMIND OF DRUG RING IS CONVICTED; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: PROSECUTORS ESTIMATED THAT THE MARIJUANA THAT A CYPRESS MAN IMPORTED 
DURING A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD TOPPED THE 34-TON MARK AND WAS WORTH MORE THAN $100 
MILLION.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Cypress man who masterminded one of the world's biggest marijuana-trafficking 
rings was convicted in federal court Thursday of arranging to smuggle at least 
34 tons of the drug by boat from Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
William E. Uhler, 40, was convicted of federal charges stemming from the drug 
smuggling business that he operated from bases in Hawaii and Orange County 
between 1984 and 1988. Some of the marijuana he imported was seized by 
authorities before it came into the country, but authorities believe most of 
the drugs he smuggled entered the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors estimated that the marijuana he imported during that four-year 
period was worth more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
They said Uhler ran a sophisticated smuggling operation that included a 
flotilla of vessels, including an 80-foot oil supply ship that secretly 
offloaded its illegal cargo to smaller boats in mid-ocean to avoid detection. 
</P>
<P>
John Zienter, who heads the Los Angeles office of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, said he has a "gut feeling" that Uhler was actually in business 
for a decade and imported about $500 million worth of marijuana. It was "one of 
the most significant marijuana rings active in the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zienter said the battle against marijuana has taken a back seat to the widely 
publicized war on cocaine in recent years. But he said that the DEA is cracking 
down again on marijuana trafficking and that Uhler's conviction is a major step 
in that campaign. 
</P>
<P>
He also cited several major marijuana rings indicted in Reno, Seattle and San 
Francisco in the last six to eight months. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we have such limited resources we have allowed (marijuana 
enforcement) to slip," Zienter said. "Because of that, in recent years the 
problem has gotten worse. All enforcement has been forced to concentrate on 
cocaine to the neglect of drugs that are serious problems, too. But we are 
readjusting our procedures and we're back on track." 
</P>
<P>
After a six-week trial and 3 1/2 days of deliberations, jurors in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles convicted Uhler on Thursday on 16 counts of 
drug-trafficking, conspiracy, and tax fraud, as well as a charge that carries a 
maximum term of life in prison without parole: conducting a continuing criminal 
enterprise. U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall scheduled sentencing for 
March 5. 
</P>
<P>
Uhler, who moved to Orange County in 1987 from Maui, Hawaii, was acquitted of 
one count of interstate travel in aid of drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney A. Brent Carruth admitted that Uhler arranged to import a 
boatload of marijuana in 1985. But Carruth said Uhler had second thoughts and 
tried to back out of the deal. Carruth was unavailable Thursday to discuss the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve other defendants were indicted with Uhler last April. Six are facing 
trial in February. They allegedly helped Uhler import the marijuana or enabled 
him to conceal the millions he made from the deals by creating false tax 
returns and letting him list property -- including an ocean-view home in Maui 
-- in their names. 
</P>
<P>
The others are Eugene LaForce, 54, of Cave Junction, Ore., who is considered 
Uhler's partner; Uhler's mother-in-law, Dovie Marie Briggs, 57, of Cypress; 
Tustin attorney Neil C. Pearson, 50; Terry P. Dee, 47, and his wife, Jeanne 
Dee, 35, both of Seal Beach, and Martin E. Levine, 40, of San Francisco and New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Tzouanakis, 36, of Costa Mesa and Dennis Tobin, 33, of Morro Bay 
pleaded guilty. Walter M. Hillinger, 57, of Hawaii was dismissed from the case, 
and Walter M. Ulrich, 39, of Sunset Beach is serving a 15-year prison term in 
Thailand. Two other Orange County men connected with the case are fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents describe how the huge boatloads of marijuana came to the United 
States: Seven tons of marijuana sailed from Thailand in June, 1985, on the Lady 
Fame, an 80-foot oil supply vessel, which transferred the shipment to two 
smaller boats off Hawaii, the documents said. Prosecutors said Uhler and his 
cohorts went to great lengths to conceal the Lady Fame's ownership, registering 
it under a fictitious partnership that included names from the obituary columns 
of an Orange County newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Fame was supposed to have carried yet another multi-ton shipment of 
marijuana from Thailand, but Uhler began to suspect that law enforcement was 
watching the boat, the court records said. He had the vessel and the unwitting 
crew remain in Southeast Asia as a decoy and had the drugs loaded onto another 
boat for shipment, court documents said. After the marijuana was transferred 
onto two smaller boats off Hawaii, records said, the crew sank the larger 
vessel. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1987, Uhler and his co-workers smuggled 11 tons of marijuana from 
Thailand to a point between Hawaii and Tahiti, where it was loaded onto another 
vessel, the Natalie Rose, and carried to the West Coast, court documents said. 
A second 11-ton shipment being smuggled by Uhler was seized by Thai officials 
in the Gulf of Thailand, the records said. 
</P>
<P>
Another five tons of marijuana was on its way to the West Coast in November, 
1988, but a Coast Guard cutter intercepted the boat off Hawaii. To avoid 
seizure, authorities said, the boat's captain set the marijuana on fire and 
abandoned ship. He and his crew were rescued and arrested.

CITY TO HOLD JULY 4 FIREWORKS DISPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has decided to sponsor an annual public fireworks display on the 
Fourth of July, starting next year. 
</P>
<P>
Hiring a fireworks show company, renting a stadium and staffing the event will 
cost about $52,600, with $2,000 coming back to the city from rental of space to 
food and game vendors, said Ronald E. Hagan, community services director. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for an annual fireworks show arose in October when the council 
considered banning the sale and use of fireworks in Fullerton. The council 
voted 3 to 2 to keep state-approved fireworks legal. 
</P>
<P>
The fireworks show is planned for the Fullerton High School Stadium, where the 
city held a fireworks show in 1987 to celebrate the city's centennial.

The Marine Institute will use the funds to expand the activities at its annual 
Festival of the Whales, held in Dana Point Harbor. Last year's festival drew 
60,000 people over three weekends, and organizers will add a concert and 
several other events. The festival will be held between Feb. 17 and March 3. 
</P>
<P>
A series of free concerts will be given by the Capistrano Valley Symphony. 
Plans include a Big Band show at La Plaza Park, a classical concert at the 
Ritz-Carlton hotel and a music program for children. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Senior Services plan to produce a video history book, using senior 
citizens reminiscing about life in Dana Point 50 years ago. The video will be 
shown to elementary school children in the Capistrano Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Other events scheduled by funding recipients include a youth literary contest 
by the Dana Point Coastal Arts Council and the Friends of the Dana Niguel 
Library; a ballet demonstration for area youths by the Coast Ballet Theatre, 
and a project to restore historical items by the Dana Point/Capistrano Beach 
Historical Society. FRANK MESSINA

CITY WORKER COLLECTS ITEMS FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without fanfare or hype, city employee Dennis Hittle each year collects a small 
truckload of food, clothing and toiletries to give to the homeless at 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The donors are fellow city employees who drop canned food and clothing into one 
of the three stainless-steel trash cans that Hittle sets up at City Hall, the 
police station and the city yard. The cans have a homey touch, being decorated 
with homemade signs and colored bows. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost become a custom and tradition here," said Robert Savage, director 
of the city maintenance service department, where Hittle, 48, has worked for 23 
years. "People know that every year, Dennis is going to set his trash cans up." 
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth year for Hittle's project. On Saturday, he and a group of 
co-workers will drive to downtown Los Angeles to distribute the items to the 
people at the Union Rescue Mission. 
</P>
<P>
Hittle chose the mission, he said, because it tries to care for the spirit as 
well as the body. He had visited the mission several years ago with a friend 
and decided then that the people there could use some extra help from 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we as city employees can do," Hittle said. "You really don't 
have to wait for an organization to start it." 
</P>
<P>
Hittle set up his first can at the city yard in 1984 after receiving permission 
from his supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"We got approval to do this at the city yard, but I thought, 'why not go 
citywide?' " Hittle said. "So I went to talk to the city manager." He admitted 
to having been a little nervous about approaching the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
But he needn't have. City Manager William C. Winter said: "I thought it was a 
really fine effort by a city employee who would want to do something like that 
on his own. . . . It's a morale booster. He sets an example for other city 
employees." TOM McQUEENEY

15 WOMEN, 6 MEN HELD FOR SOLICITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Costa Mesa police arrested 15 women and six men and booked them on suspicion of 
soliciting prostitution after a seven-hour stakeout of a two-mile strip of 
Harbor Boulevard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Jerry Holloway said 19 of those arrested were released on their own 
recognizance. Police detained two women for whom warrants had been issued after 
they failed to show up in court to answer previous prostitution charges, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Holloway said the operation began around 8 p.m. Wednesday when officers from 
the department's vice detail arrested six suspects who stood on street corners 
between Gisler Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Officers later arrested 15 men who allegedly made offers to two undercover 
female officers, Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received lots of complaints about the prostitution problem along North 
Harbor," Holloway said. "So this is just another effort to get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
The clothes of the four women who were released were seized as evidence, 
Holloway said. The women left the Costa Mesa police station wearing white 
jumpsuits issued by the police.

<P>
IDENTITY SOUGHT FOR MAY MURDER VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County coroner's office has released a sketch of a woman found dead 
in May along Coast Highway at Crystal Cove State Beach, south of Corona del 
Mar, in hopes of learning her identity. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy determined that the 5-foot, 2-inch woman was strangled. When her 
body was found about 6 a.m. on May 14, the woman was wearing a white tank top 
and short red skirt with white tennis shoes, size 7. She was 25 to 35 years old 
with blond hair and hazel eyes. Her ears were pierced and she was missing four 
upper front teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that the woman was killed elsewhere and her body was 
dumped alongside the highway, making it unlikely that she was a local resident. 
They requested that anyone who might know the identity of the woman contact the 
coroner's office at (714) 647-7000.

MAN CHARGED WITH BILKING WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph Duffy, 28, was arraigned Thursday on charges of bilking several women, 
whom he met while cruising Coast Highway, of more than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, a transient, would exchange car telephone numbers and talk with women as 
they both drove along the highway in Newport Beach, or would pull into a bank 
parking lot and begin a conversation with a woman waiting to use an automatic 
teller machine, Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
He drove a Porsche or other expensive car and convinced the women that he was a 
golf pro or an investment broker who would wisely invest the money they gave 
him, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, who has no permanent address, reportedly dated some of the women. With 
others, he just tried to win their trust. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point two months into the relationship, he would ask them to invest 
money into a business deal he was putting together," Gonis said. "They would 
give him thousands of dollars to invest in the business deal he presented to 
them. They gave him the money willingly, based on the relationship they had 
developed. He would convert the money to his own use." 
</P>
<P>
Police began building a case over the past few months as women came forward to 
complain. One of the women hired a private detective who arranged for a meeting 
with Duffy, who was arrested Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy pleaded not guilty during his arraignment Thursday in Harbor Municipal 
Court, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bruce Patterson said. Bail was set at $25,000. CHRIS

HIT-RUN DRIVER KILLS PEDESTRIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 39-year-old woman was killed Thursday when she was struck by a hit-and-run 
driver as she crossed a street in Orange, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they are seeking the public's help in finding the driver who sped 
away after he ran his vehicle into Rosa Alvarez Calletano of Orange at about 
6:15 a.m. while she was walking in the crosswalk on Tustin Street at Adams 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Orange police Sgt. Art Romo said police do not have a description of the driver 
or the car that struck the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Calletano's death caused a major traffic tie-up as officers converged to 
investigate the scene. Tustin Street, a major north-south thoroughfare near the 
Mall of Orange and parallel to the Costa Mesa Freeway, was closed during 
morning rush hours between Katella Avenue and Collins Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Cars (were) being rerouted back onto the freeway or into the residential 
streets around that section" of Tustin Street, Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were hoping to find a witness to the accident, Romo said. He 
asked that anyone with information contact Detective Jim Pyne at (714) 532-0629 
or the Orange Police Department desk at (714) 532-0365.

MIKE PENNER: 49ER HAS NEW MEANING FOR ALLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heard a new Gene Murphy rumor today. This one has him going to Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
To play quarterback for George Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's still working on getting Murphy an extra year of eligibility, but that 
shouldn't be a problem. Allen has friends at the University of North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, it doesn't look as though Billy Kilmer and Roman Gabriel are going to 
make it past the dean of admissions. 
</P>
<P>
What a match: George Allen and Long Beach. The old man and the sea. A 
71-year-old guy in short pants trying to relate to a bunch of 18-year-old 
freshmen. And how will Allen address his players? Kids? Grand kids? Great-grand 
kids? 
</P>
<P>
Allen likes seasoned players, the kind who don't make mistakes because they 
know better, but at Long Beach, his most savvy players will have 22 years of 
earth experience. That's a 49-year differential between senior and coach, which 
gives new meaning to the term Long Beach State 49er. 
</P>
<P>
Allen comes to his new assignment hailed as Captain Rebuild, the man who turned 
around the Rams and the Washington Redskins in the 1960s and '70s, which no 
doubt heightened his appeal with the Long Beach administration. 
</P>
<P>
With the 49ers, the future hasn't been now for a good decade. 
</P>
<P>
But things are done differently here and Allen has no draft choices to trade. 
In the NFL, Allen burned draft choices like kindling, swapping slews of them 
for such craggy veterans as Diron Talbert, Myron Pottios and Richie Petitbon. 
Once, Allen got so carried away, he traded a draft choice he didn't have, which 
caused all sorts of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
And about that "unlimited budget" Allen was said to have exceeded while 
coaching the Redskins? At Long Beach, the resources will be resolutely finite. 
Three years ago, the 49er football program nearly went bankrupt before a 
community drive raised $315,000, which paid for 11 victories and 24 defeats 
during the next three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But Long Beach, buried as it is under the shadow of USC and UCLA and even Cal 
State Fullerton, was starved for attention. For a while, Allen will give the 
49ers that. The day he was hired, the story was front-page news across the 
nation, which the school should appreciate while it lasts. 
</P>
<P>
The long-term ramifications are more interesting. Think George Allen and the 
word association never stops. 
</P>
<P>
Defense. The cornerstone of all Allen teams. His Rams had the Fearsome 
Foursome. His Redskins lost the lowest-scoring Super Bowl ever played, 14-7, to 
Miami in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
His 49ers are coming off a season in which they lost games by scores of 52-0 
(Fresno State), 63-10 (Hawaii) and 52-10 (Oregon). Maxie Baughan, where are 
you? 
</P>
<P>
Ice cream. Allen once called it his favorite food because you don't have to 
chew it, thus allowing you more time to concentrate on football. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have a new flavor for him: Rocky road. 
</P>
<P>
Paper cups. Strewn across the Rams' practice field during the summer of '78, 
they helped get Allen fired two exhibition games into his second incarnation in 
Los Angeles. A clean team is a mean team, Allen believes, but Allen became so 
obsessed about the Rams' sloppiness during water breaks, owner Carroll 
Rosenbloom figured his team might be better off with a coach with different 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the 49ers will learn to pick up their trash, but they'd be better 
served if they also learned to pick up the blitz. 
</P>
<P>
Hail to the Redskins. In Allen's world, loopy cheers, battle cries and team 
fight songs work. At the end of the news conference that announced his hiring 
at Long Beach, Allen thrust his fist in the air and led the room in a rousing 
chorus of "Hip! Hip! Hooray!" 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to stoking the emotional fires in his troops, Allen is shameless. 
The man will try anything. Future 49er pep talks, in a nutshell: Men, the 
Fresno State game is the biggest game of your lives. If you lose, you will have 
no reason to go on living. Substitute with Cal State Fullerton, San Jose State, 
Utah State, Nevada Las Vegas and Pacific when appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Nixon. Is it any coincidence that Nixon and Allen reigned in Washington 
at the same time? Allen had no Watergate but at various times during his NFL 
coaching career, he was accused of spying on opponents' practices, lying to 
management, breaking NFL rules and general chicanery. 
</P>
<P>
If you squint a little, you'll even notice a physical resemblance. 
</P>
<P>
Red ink. Allen usually has to splash through it when he decides to leave for 
less controversial pastures. Look at the National Fitness Foundation, which 
occupied Allen's time before this new hobby. Because financial reports haven't 
been filed on time, the foundation may lose its tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
"That's news to me," Allen says. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach, we hope you're ready. You wanted George Allen and now 
you've got him. 
</P>
<P>
If the future isn't now, you can be guaranteed that it will never be the same.

TITANS' MURPHY, NOTRE DAME ASSISTANT ARE TWO UNLV FINALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notre Dame assistant Jim Strong and Cal State Fullerton's Gene Murphy are the 
final two candidates for the Nevada Las Vegas football coaching job, sources 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV expects to name a coach at a news conference today, but had not scheduled 
one as of Thursday night. The school would not confirm whether the job had been 
offered to either candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said Thursday night he had not heard from UNLV, and that if he were 
offered the job he would not answer immediately but would take time to consider 
the offer. 
</P>
<P>
"If it happens, it happens," Murphy said. "I don't care. I'm real easy." 
</P>
<P>
Strong could not be reached for comment. He was in Wisconsin on a recruiting 
trip, according to a person who answered the phone at his home. 
</P>
<P>
Strong, 35, has coached the backfield at Notre Dame the past two seasons. He 
also has been an assistant under Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz at Minnesota and 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-member UNLV committee met for five hours Thursday before narrowing the 
list of five candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Other finalists were Rams assistant Artie Gigantino, Fresno State assistant Pat 
Hill and Houston offensive coordinator John Jenkins. Portland State Coach Pokey 
Allen, who also interviewed, withdrew earlier this week, and Gigantino withdrew 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy has earned praise for building a competitive program on a meager budget 
at a school that does not have its own stadium. In his 10 years, Fullerton is 
54-60-1. His teams have won two conference championships, in 1983 and again in 
1984 when UNLV was forced to forfeit a victory over Fullerton because the 
Rebels had used ineligible players. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy was in demand five years ago after the Titans went 11-1 and was offered 
jobs at Utah and Oregon State. Murphy chose to pursue the job at Missouri that 
year, but finished second to Woody Widenhofer, whose tenure lasted four 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
This season's 6-4-1 record has brought another round of speculation that Murphy 
would leave. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy met with Utah Athletic Director Chris Hill last week to discuss the 
vacant Utah coaching job, but was not formally interviewed. Utah named Arizona 
assistant Ron McBride, 50, as its coach on Thursday.

IRVINE'S NEW LINEUP SAME AS THE OLD ONES IN OVERTIME DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

IRVINE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan tried out his sixth starting lineup Thursday 
night against Loyola of Chicago and, quite frankly, it began no better than the 
previous five. 
</P>
<P>
For a half, No. 6 was downright dreadful. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters, with two freshmen and a gimpy point guard starting, were 
scoreless for the first three minutes before freshman Jeff Von Lutzow made a 
layup. 
</P>
<P>
But Mulligan did a little tinkering and came up with an effective combination 
in the second half. Irvine rallied from 12 points down to force overtime, then 
fell flat, 78-72, before 1,437 in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive loss for Irvine (2-7). 
</P>
<P>
Keir Rogers had 35 points and Keith Gailes 28 to lead Loyola (3-3). Every time 
Irvine would come close, Rogers or Gailes would get a key basket or free throw. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Ramblers needed every one of their points. No other 
Loyola player scored more than six points. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we got it going, somehow Rogers ended up at the line," Mulligan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine had no one to turn to in the stretch. After tying the score, 66-66, the 
Anteaters missed two chances to win in the final seconds of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Palmer's eight-footer in the lane was too short. Justin Anderson rebounded, 
but his off-balance try bounced off the rim as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
In overtime, Loyola scored first on Rogers' free throw and never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
His three-point play (a layup and free throw after a steal at midcourt) put the 
game out of reach, 72-67. 
</P>
<P>
Gailes added four free throws and Danny Stevens two in the final minute to seal 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Von Lutzow and Anderson each had 17 to lead Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, Irvine trailed by seven and was lucky it wasn't down by more. The 
Anteaters' top two scorers, Jeff Herdman and Ricky Butler, didn't have a point 
between them and Palmer, making his first start since spraining his knee Dec. 2 
was one of eight from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman finished with just seven and Butler, who fouled out with 32 seconds 
left in regulation, 10. They each average 15 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer's knee may be healed, but his jumper was hurting Thursday night. He was 
a miserable four of 19 from the field (21%) and had 10 points and eight 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm mystified, absolutely mystified," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Things got better in the second half as Mulligan tinkered with his lineup and 
finally found an effective combination. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said later that Will Rey, in his first season as Loyola coach, 
outcoached him. 
</P>
<P>
"I got outcoached and they beat us with two great players (Rogers and Gailes)," 
Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's customary poor shooting and penchant for turning the ball over also 
contributed to the loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters shot 37.5%, 34.5% in the first half, from the field. They also 
had 18 turnovers, one more than their average. 
</P>
<P>
Only once, in a 85-79 victory over Bucknell, has Irvine shot better than 50% 
this season.

"Every time we threw it away, they came down and scored," Mulligan said. "We 
just didn't get real good shots." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Loyola shot 53.2% and had only 11 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
But the Ramblers started slowly, too, and led just 4-2 with 15:44 left in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
But that changed as soon as Rogers got his jump shot warmed up. Rogers, who had 
16 points in the first half, made a three-pointer to start Loyola on a 15-0 run 
and a 16-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Von Lutzow's dunk with 8:50 left finally broke the streak. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine began to snap out of its offensive slumber, cutting the lead to 25-22 
after Rob Doktorczyk's layup. 
</P>
<P>
But Loyola pushed the lead back up to 30-23 by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine finally made it close late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Doktorczyk's layup tied the score, 63-63, with 2:14 left. 
</P>
<P>
A free throw by Craig Marshall, Irvine's other freshman starter, put the 
Anteaters ahead for the first time, 64-63. Gailes hit a free throw at the other 
end to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
A jumper by Palmer from just inside the three-point line put Irvine back ahead, 
but Gailes made two free throws with 57 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team could score and the game went into overtime.

RETAILERS COUNT ON BIG WEEKEND TO SAVE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If only Magic Johnson could sell refrigerators. With the holiday shopping 
season winding down to its final weekend, many retailers need a clutch 
performance to pull off a winning Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect sales gains of 5% to 8% for the season. Profits, however, have 
been squeezed by the sharp markdowns being offered to bring more customers into 
the stores. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a strong showing in the last few days could swing some companies' bottom 
lines "from mediocre to good," said Irving J. Weintraub, the Los Angeles 
director of retail services for the Deloitte &amp; Touche accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The last week is critical," added Craig Gordon, head of Grassroots Research in 
San Francisco. "A larger and larger group of people are making last-minute 
purchases because time has become more precious with more two-income families." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a final-weekend surge gave retailers a healthy profit gain and 
lifted general merchandise sales increases to nearly 9% over those of the 
previous year. Until then, it had seemed like a mediocre season. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's sales could have added importance for some of the nation's 
weaker retail concerns, particularly Campeau Corp. The Toronto-based company, 
which last week disclosed a widened loss of $186 million for its third quarter, 
has said it might seek bankruptcy court protection for its Federated Department 
Stores and Allied Stores divisions as soon as late January. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, about 50% of the annual profits at Campeau's department stores 
and other major retail chains come in the quarter that includes Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other major department store operators hoping for a boost from the 
holiday shopping season is R. H. Macy &amp; Co., parent of the Bullock's, I. 
Magnin and Bullocks Wilshire chains in Southern California. This month it 
reported a first-quarter loss of $33.1 million. In November, Carter Hawley Hale 
Stores, the Los Angeles-based parent of the Broadway department stores, posted 
a loss of $13.9 million for its first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts expect the markdowns that consumers have seen for the past two 
months to get even steeper over the final weekend of Christmas shopping. "The 
reality is that there is a lot of merchandise on the floors of the stores, and 
if you want to get people to buy it now, you've got to lower prices," Weintraub 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Others said, however, that most retailers don't appear to have gotten desperate 
to drum up business. Consequently, they said, consumers generally won't see 
across-the-board price cuts in the 50% range until after Christmas, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers' relatively ample inventories, analysts said, should mean that 
customers will still have a fairly good selection of merchandise. "There will 
be hot items that are missing, but people generally should be able to find what 
they want," said Elizabeth A. Armstrong of Johnson Redbook Service. 
</P>
<P>
Although the final word is yet to be written on retailers' profits, the hit 
products already have emerged. According to a nationwide survey of 422 stores 
by Grassroots Research, the hot sellers at department stores have been 
turtlenecks and other types of sweaters, leather jackets and denim and fleece 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Other big sellers have been electronic games, VCRs and video cameras, or 
camcorders. Large appliances, on the other hand, have moved slowly. 
</P>
<P>
At the discounters, Grassroots found, such items as the Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtle action figures, Nintendo video game products and such classic dolls as 
Barbie and G.I. Joe have led the way. On the other hand, the Pee Wee Herman 
line of clothing and the Donald Trump board game are going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
Grassroots reported that specialty stores have sold lots of leather bomber 
jackets, Rock'n Flowers and sweaters, but that sweat suits and clothing in neon 
colors have fared poorly. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, analysts said, consumers have been spending cautiously, 
looking hard for bargains.

NATIONAL EDUCATION GETS YEAR EXTENSION ON LOANS; 
</P>

RECOVERY: BELEAGUERED IRVINE FIRM BUYS TIME IN REPAYING $62 MILLION. IT SEEKS 
TO BATTLE BACK FROM LOSSES TOTALING $8 MILLION IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS.

<TEXT>
<P>
National Education Corp. said Thursday it has obtained a one-year extension on 
some $62 million in loans, giving the beleaguered company added time to try to 
recover from a series of costly blunders. 
</P>
<P>
Five different banks agreed to the extension, provided NEC put up stock in some 
of its subsidiaries as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
The new loans, which will mature Dec. 31, 1990, will bear interest at 1.75% 
above the prime rate. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also requires NEC to raise a minimum of $10 million in additional 
capital by April 30. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it will actually try to raise an additional $15 million to pay 
back part of the loans, as well as establish something akin to an emergency 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
NEC, the nation's largest provider of vocational and educational training 
services, said it would raise the money through a private debt or stock 
offering, or by having its subsidiaries take out loans. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock -- which has plunged more than 50% in the last six months 
-- closed down 25 cents to $6.25, very near its 52-week low of $5.75. 
</P>
<P>
The company has lost $8 million dollars in the last six months largely because 
of problems at its Applied Learning division, which sells educational materials 
and services to corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Chairman David C. Jones and President Jerome Cwiertnia told 
stockholders they intend to reduce costs at Applied Learning by at least $20 
million over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
About 140 employees at Applied Learning have been laid off, along with 18 
middle managers and support personnel at corporate headquarters in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
NEC now says it has problems at Applied Learning under control. 
</P>
<P>
Customers of the Naperville, Ill.-based subsidiary were being overbilled, 
undercharged or given services completely free, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Those snags developed after three separate companies were merged to create 
Applied Learning. 
</P>
<P>
Former chairman and chief executive H. David Bright was ousted from NEC in 
July, partly because of the snafus at Applied Learning. 
</P>
<P>
But there are other problems, including declining enrollments at the company's 
vocational schools, where a 10% drop in attendance has been partially offset by 
a hike in tuition. 
</P>
<P>
Three months after Bright's departure, a New York investor filed a class-action 
lawsuit against NEC and its top executives charging they misled investors 
during the summer as to the company's financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that NEC tried to hide the problems at Applied Learning and 
made falsely optimistic statements about the company's condition in order to 
inflate its stock price. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second time this year NEC has been hit with such a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The company has said it will vigorously defend itself against the investor's 
allegations.

GETTING MAULED AT MALL IS KEY TO THIS WEEKEND; 
</P>

RETAILERS: SOME STORE OWNERS SAY CHRISTMAS SALES SO FAR LEAVE SOMETHING TO BE

Donna Robb gave a big smile Thursday as she confidently packed a quilt for a 
customer at a South Coast Plaza apparel store. It was a knowing look that 
customers get a lot these days from Orange County retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we expecting a ton of customers this weekend? We sure are!" said Robb, a 
sales clerk at Laura Ashley Mother &amp; Child. After all, with Christmas on 
Monday this year, "people feel they've got an extra day. All the last-minute 
shoppers will go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
The same bubbly exuberance could be heard up and down the aisles of malls 
throughout Orange County this week. Shopkeepers who have so far reported a 
lackluster holiday season have high hopes that their tills will jingle nonstop 
the final three days before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"The month started a lot slower, but we've been getting real busy this past 
week," said Cindy McKay, a district manager with Splash &amp; Flash, a boutique 
at Newport Center/Fashion Island, which is running low on some popular, 
lower-priced items such as purses, T-shirts and nail-polish packs. 
</P>
<P>
Many local retailers are hoping that the final weekend will produce a good 
season. Typically, malls are last-minute madhouses when Christmas falls right 
after a weekend. And the rush is expected to begin today, as many employees 
leave work early for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, last-minute shopping seems to be a growing trend. For the last 
several years, more and more customers have been tending to wait until the 11th 
hour, said Matthew Martinez, assistant manager at Burberry's at South Coast 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
"This mall has become a real last-minute type of mall," said Martinez, a 
veteran sales associate who has worked at the Costa Mesa shopping center for 
several years. In fact, in years past, he said, sales have doubled the final 
two to three days before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure and catch those Christmas Eve shoppers, many retailers plan to 
extend their hours this weekend. Burberry's, a pricey apparel store, plans to 
be fully staffed with eight sales clerks throughout the weekend and open its 
doors for a full 12 hours on both Saturday and Sunday, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
At MainPlace/Santa Ana, Pacific Sunwear also is gearing up for the expected 
crunch. The surfwear shop plans to have six to eight sales people this weekend, 
instead of the usual four. 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, retail is lower this year," said Tanya Rountree, assistant 
manager at the store. "But we expect to be very, very busy this weekend. We're 
expecting it to make the whole season -- definitely." 
</P>
<P>
To give customers that extra incentive, some local merchants are resorting to 
price-slashing during the crucial final week. 
</P>
<P>
At The City Mall in Orange, for instance, Hatfield Jewelers on Monday put up 
huge signs, advertising half-price discounts on most of its merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't plan on it, but business has not been so booming, so we've been 
running (the sale) for the entire week," said the store's manager, who asked 
not to be named. "We hope this will be one of the biggest weekends of the 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County store owners have been watching sales figures nervously, 
hoping a slowing economy won't hamper holiday buying. But many shoppers 
Thursday seemed more concerned with traffic congestion than the amount of cash 
they would spend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a last-minute thing for me -- it's always that way," said Greg 
Huthersall, who is in Orange County on vacation. So the 29-year-old bookkeeper 
from Canada spent Thursday at South Coast Plaza where he managed to find two 
gifts. But he's sure he'll be back Saturday -- at least. "I think it's going to 
be hell, but I enjoy it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As dusty boxes of Christmas tree ornaments are pulled out of the closet this 
time of year, so are the usual complaints about a lack of parking and getting 
mauled at the malls. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just got to get it done," said Libby Rydell, 22, a student from Villa 
Park who started her holiday shopping this week and was only half-way done on 
Thursday. "It'll be hectic and crowded, but I'll be here."

ZUBE TUBE SOUNDS LIKE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HIT 
</P>

<P>
There's not much to the Zube Tube, the Ultimate Cosmic Sound Machine. But then, 
there wasn't much to the Hula-Hoop, either. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-inch-long, brightly colored cardboard tube can produce sounds from "Star 
Wars" battles and MTV-style echoes to Gregorian chants, whale songs and the 
ocean's roar. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of noises you want to make are as infinite as your imagination," 
said Judy A. Walls, senior vice president of Ritam International Ltd., a toy 
company in the southeastern Iowa town of Fairfield. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no batteries, no electricity," she said. "I think everybody is just 
'electroniced' out." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the 2 3/4-inch-diameter tube is a spring that acts as an acoustic coil. 
The spring is connected at each end by custom-made plastic cups. A hole on the 
side of the tube allows a child's -- or adult's -- finger to reach in and pluck 
the spring, which produces the myriad of sounds. 
</P>
<P>
A person can also speak into the hole, as well as either end of the tube, to 
produce even more sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's going to be the next Hula-Hoop. In its first 18 months, they sold 
something like 100 million Hula-Hoops," Walls said. "We plan on doing the same 
thing. I think three years is realistic." 
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 Zube Tubes have been sold since they were marketed in 
mid-September, she said. The suggested retail price is $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
Toy and gift companies in Finland, Switzerland, Germany, France, England and 
Canada have inquired about the tube. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Watsey, Ritam executive vice president, said that while in London, a 
group of company officials went to Harrod's to tape a video using the 
department store's Zube Tube display. However, they ended up filming an empty 
display because the store was sold out, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They say over there that the Zube Tube is more popular than Nintendo," Watsey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of the Zube Tube was developed by Bob Deissler, who was studying 
physics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing with a slinky and it happened to touch a Styrofoam cup," said 
Deissler, who was visiting the 10-year-old toy company this week. 
</P>
<P>
Intrigued by the sound, Deissler experimented with a different type of spring a 
year later. 
</P>
<P>
"It worked really great. That's when I really decided to pursue it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deissler applied for and received a patent in 1980.

INVESTOR GOT A BARGAIN IN BUYING FAILED S&amp;L;

FINANCE: REVLON CHAIRMAN RONALD O. PERELMAN STANDS TO GAIN MILLIONS AFTER 
AGREEING TO TAKE OVER FIRST GIBRALTAR BANK OF HOUSTON.

<P>
When government officials sold dozens of failed savings and loans in the waning 
days of 1988, some thrift experts criticized the deals as too generous for the 
buyers and too rough on taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Now the numbers on one of the largest deals are in, and the critics are saying 
they were right. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of New York-based Revlon Inc. and the country's 
fifth-richest person according to Forbes magazine, will recover $1.70 this year 
for every $1 he invested last year in First Gibraltar Bank, a Houston savings 
and loan, according to a confidential financial document obtained by Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
First Gibraltar will provide Perelman with a $104-million profit for 1989, 
according to figures derived from the document. In addition, tax breaks from 
owning the S&amp;L will save Perelman $170 million in federal income taxes. The 
profits and the tax savings combine to give Perelman about a 170% return on his 
$160-million investment. 
</P>
<P>
Making money isn't new for Perelman, who has built an estimated $2.75-billion 
fortune from buying and selling companies. Perelman, 46, is regarded as one of 
the nation's shrewdest investors. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, S&amp;L analysts were surprised when told of Perelman's return on 
the purchase of First Gibraltar. "What this means is Perelman has gotten all 
his money back," said Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., savings and loan expert who 
criticized the First Gibraltar deal last year. "Everything from now on is pure 
gravy. They could take that thing away from him tomorrow and he's already had a 
hell of a good deal." 
</P>
<P>
The purchase agreement calls for Perelman to get government assistance and tax 
breaks for another nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fantastic return," said Robert Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings 
Institution in Washington after studying the nation's S&amp;L crisis. "If these 
numbers are right, it's out of all proportion to the risks." He said risky 
deals that turn out well usually have a return of about 30% a year. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Gittis, a senior aide to Perelman, declined to comment. He said he 
couldn't discuss First Gibraltar's financial performance because the 
institution is in the process of selling some bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure comes at a time of increasing concern on Capitol Hill about the 
deals that savings-and-loan regulators arranged during the waning moments of 
1988. Eager to unload money-losing S&amp;Ls, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, 
led by M. Danny Wall, sold 68 failed institutions last December before the tax 
breaks expired at year's end. The breaks allowed investors to deduct from their 
other income whatever the S&amp;L would have lost if it hadn't been bailed out. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of bailing out the savings and loans of the so-called "December deals" 
and the nation's other sick S&amp;Ls is estimated at $160 billion. 
</P>
<P>
House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) has said his 
committee will investigate each of the December deals. The Perelman transaction 
is the largest. 
</P>
<P>
"Our chairman feels they're not cost-effective," said Julie Black, a 
spokeswoman for the committee. "Gonzalez is really concerned that the 
government did not get the best deals on these last-minute transactions." She 
said First Gibraltar is likely to come up in hearings that are to begin Jan. 
22. 
</P>
<P>
Former Bank Board member Lawrence White defended the Perelman deal as the best 
the government could arrange at the time. "I'm still convinced it's the best 
deal we could get for taxpayers," said White, now a New York University 
professor. He said it would have cost taxpayers more to liquidate the 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
White added that Perelman deserves to be compensated for the tremendous risks 
he took in buying First Gibraltar. White said that no one knew for sure last 
December whether the government would make good on the Bank Board promises to 
S&amp;L investors. 
</P>
<P>
Litan, however, said Perelman took little risk because the chances of the 
government reneging were remote. He believes Perelman got such good terms 
because he was one of the few people willing to take on a sick Texas S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
First Gibraltar has about $9 billion in loans and other assets. About $4 
billion worth are in default and losing money. Under the terms of Perelman's 
takeover agreement, the government makes up the losses and guarantees a profit. 
According to the financial document -- a confidential-offering circular used to 
refinance First Gibraltar's debt -- the government will contribute about $700 
million to the thrift this year. 
</P>
<P>
With the government assistance, First Gibraltar will make about $130 million, 
making it one of the most profitable S&amp;Ls in the country. Under the terms 
of Perelman's takeover, he gets to keep 80% of the profits, or $104 million. 
</P>
<P>
That's only part of Perelman's return. The rest comes in the form of a tax 
break for MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, the company that owns First Gibraltar. 
MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, 100% owned by Perelman, also owns cosmetics giant 
Revlon. 
</P>
<P>
MacAndrews &amp; Forbes can shield about $510 million in income in 1989, the 
document said. At a 34% tax rate, that saves Perelman about $170 million in 
taxes.

FORMER SOVIET SKATE STARS TOP BILL AT KNOTT'S

<P>
Shortly after the figure skating team of Irina Korina and Viktor Yelchin 
finished their first rehearsal for this holiday's edition of Knott's Berry 
Farm's "Festival on Ice," Korina had a question about a routine set to "Silent 
Night." 
</P>
<P>
"We have heard this music before," she said. "What is it?" 
</P>
<P>
Their ignorance of what is perhaps the world's best-known Christmas carol may 
be partly due to the fact that the couple is Jewish. But the main reason is 
that they have only recently arrived in the United States from the Soviet 
Union, where Dec. 25 is but another date on the calendar and it is New Year's 
Eve that calls for celebrating with gifts under a tree. 
</P>
<P>
As stars for 15 years of the Leningrad Ice Ballet, the skaters, who are 
married, were national celebrities. Financially well off by Soviet standards, 
they owned their own flat in Leningrad as well as a home in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But on Sept. 12, they left their native city with then-6-month-old son Anton, 
Korina's father and Yelchin's mother, and settled in Los Angeles with Yelchin's 
brother Eugene, a free-lance illustrator who lives in the Silverlake district. 
The five stayed briefly with Eugene and now share an apartment in West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their more famous compatriots, Ludmila and Oleg Protopopov (the 1964 and 
1968 Olympic Pair Champions who now live in Switzerland), Korina, 32, and 
Yelchin, 38, did not defect; they are officially classified as refugees. Asked 
why they decided to forsake fame and relative fortune to start over again in 
the United States, the couple answers immediately, as one: 
</P>
<P>
"Anton." 
</P>
<P>
"We were afraid for our son," explained Yelchin, sitting with his extended 
family in the couple's dressing room during a rehearsal break at Knott's Good 
Time Theatre, where the show runs until New Year's Day. "It is a very bad 
situation over there. I would get angry, too -- I'd say, 'Why should we have to 
buy things on the black market? Why should we have to stand in line?' " 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, there was religious and political oppression. In 1972, as the 
nationally third-ranked pair team, they qualified for the Olympics but were not 
permitted to go because of their religion. More recently, a production they 
choreographed was performed by the Leningrad Ice Ballet only after other 
choreographers' names replaced theirs for public credit. And for three years 
after Eugene Yelchin had moved to the United States, married to an American 
woman he met in Leningrad, the skaters were forbidden to perform outside their 
own country. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'We cannot find your forms, you must stay home,' " Korina recalled. 
"Then Gorbachev came in, and we could skate abroad again. They were three 
difficult years." 
</P>
<P>
They are adjusting quickly to American life, despite some early misgivings. 
"You have propaganda (about the U.S.S.R.), but we have propaganda, too," 
Yelchin noted. "Every day we heard about capitalism; that man in America is a 
wolf." Added Korina, "We thought about it, but since we've come we see only 
smiles." 
</P>
<P>
It did not take long to discover some of the elements that particularly define 
Los Angeles. "What's especially good for me is Melrose (Avenue)!" Korina said. 
"I like the people on the street and the stores." 
</P>
<P>
Yelchin said, "Everyone here wants to make movies. My brother studied at USC 
and wants to direct an independent film." Korina added, "A woman came up, saw 
Anton, and said, 'He's beautiful. He will be actor.' " 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after their arrival, the skaters were signed for 
representation by manager Michael Rosenberg, whose other clients include 1988 
Olympic silver medalist Elizabeth Manley and former world pair champions Tai 
Babilonia and Randy Gardner. They made their U.S. debut last month as guest 
stars of Richard Porter's "Celebration on Ice" show at Bally's Grand Hotel and 
Casino in Atlantic City, then traveled to Ottawa to take part in the World Cup 
of Figure Skating competition, placing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Skating in the West bears some similarity to their Soviet experience -- "As 
principals, we're still seeing hotels, rinks, always talking about skating," 
Yelchin noted -- but has so far yielded one major difference. "We were stars in 
Leningrad, but that did not have the same meaning as here," Yelchin said. "In 
Leningrad, we could say, 'Today, we will take it easy.' At Bally's, we were 
billed as very special guest stars, and every day we had to be great, great, 
great." 
</P>
<P>
They have found that North American audiences and skaters alike are receptive 
to their skating style, which combines classic Soviet grace and lyricism with 
such precisely timed acrobatic moves as a pull-through in which Korina somehow 
manages to go from a lift to an upside-down position and through her husband's 
legs in a matter of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"One woman at Bally's told us she had seen us seven times," Korina recounted. 
"And we have made many friends in just a short time. . . . At the competition, 
when we said goodby, the (other) skaters said, 'No say goodby, we'll be seeing 
each other soon.' I've cried many times at this warm feeling." 
</P>
<P>
The pair were cast in Knott's Berry Farm's "Festival on Ice" after producer 
Dick Foster watched them practice a mere 10 minutes at a local rink. "Their 
movements are extremely fluid -- they remind me a lot of the Protopopovs," said 
Foster, who spent three months in the U.S.S.R. in 1973 as producer of the 
television special "Peggy Fleming Visits the Soviet Union" and has produced 
numerous other television and live skating shows. "They have a unique 
presentation -- so fluid and yet so adventurous. There's a reason the Soviets 
have dominated (amateur) competitive pair skating for years." 
</P>
<P>
In "Festival on Ice," opening today and running daily through Jan. 1 with shows 
at 1, 3 and 5 p.m., the pair perform two routines and the finale. There are a 
dozen holiday-themed numbers in the 30-minute show, which is directed by David 
Gravatt and also features soloists Cindy Stuart and Doug Webster, the Peanuts 
characters Snoopy, Charlie Brown and Lucy and a 10-member ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Show choreographer Randy Gardner is trying to inject some flashier American 
moves into Korina/Yelchin's style: their first number is a rhythmic, upbeat 
version of "Good King Wenceslaus." 
</P>
<P>
"They do some spectacular stuff, but I want to add a different voice, change 
their thinking about different patterns and lifts," he said. "Working with them 
is interesting because of the language barrier -- I use ballet terminology, 
which is universal, or try to describe something with a gesture, no talking, 
which is kind of wild but fun. They understand." 
</P>
<P>
While their next engagement after Knott's is not yet set, the pair may be 
returning to Bally's. Farther afield, they would like to return to Leningrad -- 
but for a visit only, to show Anton the city. "I have the American Dream -- to 
buy a house," Korina said. "The American people's life is more fun, more easy, 
more beautiful. It's great. We won't leave." 
</P>
<P>
 "Festival on Ice" runs today through Jan. 1, except Christmas Day, at 1, 3 and 
5 p.m. in the Good Time Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, 8039 Beach Blvd., Buena 
Park. Admission included with park admission: $15.95 to $19.95. Park hours: 10 
a.m. to 6 p.m. today; 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday; 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday; 
Closed Monday; 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday. Information: (714)

'50S ROCK FLOAT TO ROLL IN '90 ROSE PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Brad Jansen is jazzed about the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just his love of sock hops, malt shops and cool Caddys with fins that 
excites the 35-year-old Buena Park advertising art director. It's more that his 
design of a rolling rock 'n' roll-era float has been chosen to represent the 
city of Burbank in the 1990 Tournament of Roses Parade, to be held Jan. 1 in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Not only will 1 million people lining the parade route view his floral creation 
as it cruises Colorado Boulevard in the company of 59 other floats, 22 marching 
bands and more than 275 costumed equestrians, but his concept will greet 
millions of television viewers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"If each of the more than 300 million people who will see this float were to 
send me just 1 cent, I would have more than $3 million," jokes Jansen, who's 
come a long way from his first design job hot out of Cal State Fullerton with a 
degree in art. He was drawing surfers on T-shirts. "Better yet, $3.33 each 
would net me $1 billion -- before taxes." 
</P>
<P>
The billion-dollar man will have to wait, however. The float Jansen "dreamed 
up" and spent more than 80 hours rendering and refining before the Burbank 
Tournament of Roses Assn. decreed it the best of 20 entries in its annual 
design contest is still parked in a Burbank warehouse. It has been under 
construction since March, and more work is needed before it can roll on New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Rock 'n' roll, that is. Called the Be-Bop Malt Shop, this flowered fantasy is a 
hoppin', boppin' blend of spectacle and showmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Designed in Art Deco shapes and zingy neon shades, the float is a teen-age 
drive-in hangout where a giant double cheeseburger, extra large fries and a 
soda reaching the float's height -- 22 1/2 feet -- loom over a guitar-shaped 
dance floor that's anchored by curvy counters, diner stools and -- serving as a 
huge hood ornament -- a jukebox. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing behind the Be-Bop, below a sign proclaiming "Sock Hop Tonight!" are a 
'59 Cadillac El Dorado and '57 Corvette -- two slick sets of wheels re-created 
to two-thirds scale in authentic detail. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be two waitresses in bobby socks bouncing around and sock hop 
dancers in costumes flying all over the dance floor," Jansen said as he 
described the production number to be staged on the float as it glides for more 
than two hours and 5 1/2 miles along the parade route. "Do you believe it? It's 
all part of the concept, and it's neat. I hope people will notice." 
</P>
<P>
His '50s flashback was definitely noticed by Burbank's Tournament of Roses 
Assn. when it was selected in February over all other contest submissions, some 
from such design heavyweights as the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Brad's design was absolutely the most exciting -- a show float that would be 
fun to build -- and it was almost a unanimous vote right away," says Erik 
Anderson, 23, vice president of the Burbank parade association and a member of 
the committee in charge of selecting a crowd pleaser that would embody this 
year's Tournament of Roses theme, "A World of Harmony," and show that Burbank 
could compete with the large-size floats. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually during the parade we realize how, well, small our float is next to 
those monstrosities," Anderson said, referring to the works of animated art 
that are built by seasoned professionals. These builders are showered with 
corporate dollars in the hope of making an impressive New Year's Day splash 
with an elaborate, blooming testament to their corporate identity. 
</P>
<P>
"Brad's concept is the biggest Burbank has ever had -- 55 feet long and 22 1/2 
feet high. Plus, his idea of the '50s is it! There's a lot of nostalgia 
happening now for the era. You know, Elvis. Rock 'n' roll," says Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
While Elvis won't be playing the Be-Bop Malt Shop on parade day, rock 'n' roll 
will be in full force, because Jansen is crazy about all those tunes beloved by 
baby boomers. Sock hoppers bop to Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire" while 
roller-skating waitresses balance trays. Radio station KRLA will broadcast the 
float's music live. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing is going to come around the corner blasting Jerry Lee, Little 
Richard, everybody," Jansen said. "I hope everything works. That the straws on 
the soda twirl. That the dancers are hoppin' and boppin' with lots of charisma. 
And that there are no sudden stops where they all fall into the jukebox and 
knock it off." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, ambitious parade presentations have survived untold precarious 
moments from the time their concept is approved to their public debut. Design 
and construction disasters in the Tournament of Roses' 101-year history have 
resulted in floats limping toward the finish, their animation de-animated, 
their motors broken, their fresh flowers wilted, and their riders (some of whom 
must perform nonstop for two hours) exhausted, sunburned and blistered. 
</P>
<P>
All of the disaster stories have failed to dissuade the Be-Bop Malt Shop's crew 
of volunteers. With a budget of $69,000, they will put in more than 1,000 hours 
building and gilding their float. 
</P>
<P>
And they will be thrilled to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The preparation has been a large part of the parade excitement since the first 
Tournament of Roses, when members of Pasadena's Valley Hunt Club threw garlands 
of blooms over their horses and buggies, and promenaded to the "town lot" for 
an afternoon of foot races, tugs-o-war and jousting. 
</P>
<P>
The parade and football games have a history rich in novelty -- with "Ben 
Hur"-style chariot races, ostrich competitions and, in 1913, an elephant-camel 
contest. It has glamour -- with rhinestone-decked rose queens. It has celebrity 
-- with grand marshals that have included four presidents, three astronauts and 
Shirley Temple, twice; once, as a child star, and again as a U.S. ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a boastful Southern California show, it's been a rousing triumph over 
winter. While some of the country wrestles with snowdrifts and battles 
temperatures below zero, the Tournament of Roses is an unrestrained display of 
that harbinger of spring flowers -- from household roses to exotic cattleya 
orchids and every colorful variety in between. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers who are working painstakingly in a Burbank warehouse to make 
Jansen's vision a reality are welding rods to shape a Cadillac, forming foam to 
resemble fries, and painting Wurlitzer details to color-code where the flowers 
will eventually be placed. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning a few days before the parade, volunteers will work around the clock 
filling tiny vials with water, placing individual flowers in each, and then 
arranging more than 75,000 flowers on the Be-Bop Malt Shop to comply with 
Tournament rules that require natural, living material covering every exposed 
inch of the float. Or, as Anderson explains the rule, "something that already 
died but created something else, like sunflower seeds or seaweed." 
</P>
<P>
As an illustrator and graphic designer, Jansen says he believes his knack is 
taking "the most incredible, impossible challenge and making it work." In his 
current position as senior art director at Hipke Inc. in Glendale, he devised 
award-winning ads and promotions for such entertainment powerhouses as 
Paramount Pictures and Columbia Pictures Television. He strains at the seams 
with confidence: "When I'm finished with something if it doesn't look good, at 
least it's as good as anyone can do." 
</P>
<P>
It's funny, says Jansen, who lives with his wife, Patty, daughter Cari, 8 and 
son Kevin, 3, "you tell people that I've done work for Columbia and Paramount, 
that I've done the movie posters for 'Twins,' the 'Star Trek' 25th anniversary 
logo, and I designed a Rose float. And they go, 'Oh my God! A float? You're 
kidding!' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a business where 90% of the brilliant ideas you spray out are no-go. 
And the one out of 20 that makes it is picked apart and criticized, and you're 
forever told to 'develop this further.' The float, though, gets notice! 
Everyone's just wild about the '50s. And it's neat. People will hear my name. 
Hopefully, if Stephanie Edwards says it correctly." 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Andy Warhol's 15 minutes of fame," says Jansen as he happily slaves 
away alongside the volunteers furiously painting and prepping the Be-Bop Malt 
Shop for the big day. "But for me, it's about 30 seconds -- as my float passes 
by. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame," he says, laughing, then delivers a dramatic sigh, "only one day 
of glory. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Jansen would like his float to win a trophy from the judges of the 
Tournament of Roses. Perhaps for best interpretation of the "World of Harmony" 
theme, he hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"Or maybe for being the coolest," he jokes. "Yeah, we should open up a whole 
new award category. The coolest. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it is, isn't it?" 
</P>

CHRISTMAS AT HANOI HILTON; 
</P>
<P>
UNFORGETTABLE MEMORIES OF LONG-AGO HOLIDAYS AWAY FROM HOME AND COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Dave Rehmann was only 24 on his first Christmas at the "Hanoi Hilton" when 
guards took him from solitary confinement to a room with a Christmas tree and a 
Nativity display. "I kind of stood there. . . . I didn't know what I was 
supposed to do. So (the guard) motioned me over to this Nativity scene and made 
me kneel down. He kind of pushed me down, like I was supposed to pray or 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"I knelt there for a while and I thought, well, I wonder if this is long 
enough. Then I got up and I stood there and they seemed to be satisfied and 
they took me back to my room. "And I said, well, OK, so much for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
The year was 1966. Rehmann would spend six more Christmases as a prisoner of 
war in North Vietnam before he finally boarded the plane to freedom and his 
family in Garden Grove. Coming home with him were men like David Hoffman of 
Huntington Beach and Dave Luna, who grew up in the city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
All three were pilots and all spent Christmas of 1972 at the "Hanoi Hilton," 
the North Vietnamese prison formally known as Hoa Lo. Months later, as the 
United States withdrew its ground forces from Vietnam, they and more than 600 
POWs who survived the camps returned home. 
</P>
<P>
As they got ready for this year's holiday, the three remembered what it was 
like to be a prisoner, half a world away from America, deprived of family and 
freedom. And they remembered how those were exactly the kind of thoughts they 
banished when they were behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
"You were hardened to the fact that you were not going to be with your family," 
said Luna, whose parents still live in Orange and who graduated from Orange 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
"On the human side, you can't help think about" Christmas at home. "But we 
couldn't afford to think about it too much because there wasn't anything we 
could do. . . . It was obvious . . . this was not to be a Christmas like 
Christmases past." 
</P>
<P>
Nor do the men talk nowadays about those ghosts of Christmas past. They will 
discuss it if they are asked, but with varying degrees of detail and in calm, 
just-the-facts-ma'am tones. 
</P>
<P>
Even on his first Christmas free in seven years -- December of 1973 back home 
in Orange -- Luna says he didn't spend a lot of time thinking how different 
that holiday was from the one the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"I at least tried to block it all out from my mind," he says. "If you're 
standing there listening to Christmas carols, you don't want to think how bad 
it was; you want to think how nice it is." 
</P>
<P>
Rehmann, an unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congress from Orange County 
the year after he returned from the war, said he generally thinks of his POW 
experiences only when asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not real emotional about getting the blues on holidays or anything like 
that," he says with a smile. Christmas in Hanoi was by and large just another 
day. But what of subsequent Christmases? Last year, for instance? 
</P>
<P>
He searches his memory, and finally retrieves what he thinks it was like last 
year. "I think I went over to my mom's for dinner," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Rehmann, now a San Diego businessman, does have his attachments, though. He 
still has the 1973 Corvette given him by the people in Lancaster, where he grew 
up. The car's license plate reads, POW FREE. 
</P>
<P>
And he does remember a Christmas in captivity besides his first one as a POW, 
even if he's hazy on the year, "probably in the late '60s or early '70s." 
</P>
<P>
On that memorable Christmas, "they brought us in and they sat us down and they 
had some peanuts in a dish. There might have been even some mints, I can't 
really recall. But they had one thing that was interesting, and that was like 
an orange liqueur. . . . And they sat down and they wished us a happy holiday 
or whatever it was, Merry Christmas, and they gave us this little drink. . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
Dave Luna was shot down in March of 1967 and spent month after month after 
month telling the North Vietnamese that he was an unmarried orphan. Actually, 
he had a wife and two children in Utah and parents in Orange. Still, he figured 
it would be easier on himself and his family if his jailers didn't know whom he 
had left behind -- just one less set of psychological buttons for his captors 
to push. 
</P>
<P>
But after two Christmases that were just another day in prison, 1969 was 
different. 
</P>
<P>
Prison conditions had improved that year, Luna said, a phenomenon he thinks was 
probably due to halts in the U.S. bombing. Yet prisoners kept trying to escape, 
and Luna was back in isolation as November of 1969 rolled around because he had 
been part of an unsuccessful escape try. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Christmas, Luna was taken to a room to be questioned by an army 
major. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Luna, I have a message for you for Christmas, from your father.' I 
told him, 'No, you're mistaken. My father's dead and I'm an orphan.' He throws 
me a letter from my dad. I look at it, I throw it at him and I say, 'It's not 
mine.' " 
</P>
<P>
Luna had been a POW nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first time I had any contact with anyone from back home." 
</P>
<P>
Now newly retired from the Air Force after reaching the rank of colonel and 
living just outside Washington, Luna said that later Christmases as a POW were 
memorable largely because there was no harassment. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers occasional Christmas carols over the camp loudspeakers, some of 
them sung by fellow POWs and some of them recordings by Perry Como. 
</P>
<P>
Luna remembers 1972 as "one of my better Christmases" because the POWs knew 
freedom was near. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the U.S. "Christmas bombing" of Hanoi that year, an event burned into 
Hoffman's memory, was not recalled by Luna at all. "Maybe I just blocked it 
out," he said a few weeks ago, after putting up a 14-foot tree in his Maryland 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas of '72 was one to be remembered. We were told then that our main 
responsibility, as (the North Vietnamese) put it, was . . . to get healthy so 
we could go home to be with our loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
"So they started giving us some darned good food: pieces of chicken, boiled 
soup." 
</P>
<P>
One year later, after his release, Luna was stationed in Texas but took leave 
to be with his parents in Orange for the holidays. Texas entrepreneur H. Ross 
Perot offered to help him get home, and then, after finding out that wasn't 
necessary, said he would like to send a gift, Luna remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"I got home, said, 'Hi, see you when I get back,' and went running around on 
all different errands. Everyone did what they could to keep me (at home)" or 
get him there. On Christmas Eve, he found out why. 
</P>
<P>
Perot "sent a bunch of Christmas carolers over to my parents' home, and they 
sang Christmas carols for over an hour. It was outstanding. . . . The carolers 
took up the front lawn. It was a surprise to end all surprises. And a very 
pleasant one." 
</P>
<P>
Like Rehmann, David Hoffman was a Navy flier. Like Rehmann, he was shot down 
while flying an F-4 fighter jet off the aircraft carrier Coral Sea. But when he 
was shot down just after Christmas in 1971, on his wedding anniversary ("I joke 
that I was shot down twice on the same date"), he was 30 years old, had been in 
the Navy 10 years and was on the fast track that would eventually take him to 
the rank of captain and one of the Navy's top commands, skippering the aircraft 
carrier Kitty Hawk. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers Christmas of 1972 well, especially the bombs and the food. 
</P>
<P>
The B-52 bombings of Hanoi and Haiphong occurred after peace talks between the 
North Vietnamese and Americans broke down in Paris. They were praised and 
condemned across the United States, mirroring the way the war divided the 
country. But to Hoffman, the bombs meant he would be going home soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I can remember when the first heavy bombing raid started (just before 
Christmas)," Hoffman said. "The guards . . . were absolutely scared. There was 
just a universal feeling . . . that there was no question (among the American 
POWs) that the war was going to be over in a very short period of time because 
(the Vietnamese) all of a sudden realized that we had the capability to hit 
them where it hurt. Up to then it had just been nickel-and-dime stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Early in the first raid, an American F-111 fighter screamed over Hanoi from the 
west, "literally . . . at tree-top level," Hoffman said. "It was so low it 
shook the building. And (the Vietnamese) didn't know it was coming." As a 
result, the air raid sirens had not wailed and the lights of the city had not 
been doused. 
</P>
<P>
"For the next hour, all hell broke loose. I mean there were just bombs all over 
the place, missiles flying all over the sky. It was just an amazing, amazing 
sight." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman's other Christmas memory is the food. 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas, "they would feed us a decent meal," said Hoffman, who now lives 
in Huntington Beach. "And by that I mean, usually a piece of roast chicken or 
roast goose or something like that, a salad, and some candy and maybe a few 
extra cigarettes, that sort of thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas and Easter, and their holiday of Tet (the lunar new year). Those 
were the days that they fed us a decent meal. 
</P>
<P>
"And they also brought a priest in on Christmas Eve to do a Mass. And you have 
to remember, I was shot down late enough (in the war) that I had seen some of 
the films of some of the propaganda stuff. And we were very leery of, 'Are they 
at it again?' But there was no hint of that." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman wasn't Catholic, but he went to the Mass anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a matter of that's what Christmas was all about to me. You celebrated 
the birth of Christ and going to church was part of it." 
</P>
<P>
There is a certain symmetry about Hoffman's holidays from the early 1970s. 
Christmas of 1971 saw him flying F-4 aircraft off the carrier Coral Sea. 
Christmas of 1972 found him in Hanoi as a POW. Christmas of 1973 found him home 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman says his time behind bars had been especially hard on his son, who was 
almost 5 when Hoffman returned home. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are cruel. Kids in the neighborhood would say, 'Your daddy's in jail.' 
They didn't know. He used to come home in tears, I understand. 'What did Daddy 
do? Why is Daddy being punished?' It was hard for him." 
</P>
<P>
He remembers "just an awfully good feeling to be back for Christmas with the 
family. The whole family was there as I recall. I remember taking my son out 
and getting him a puppy, a little Irish setter puppy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We got it (from) the Humane Society. It had been mistreated, but it was the 
prettiest dog we'd seen. It just had these big, brown, sad eyes, and it looked 
up at you. We took that puppy home, and I remember how much fun that Christmas 
was, because of the puppy and my son."

STYLE: LINGERIE SHOPS MAKE GROWN MEN SHY

<P>
Inside the potpourri-scented interiors of Victoria's Secret, Armin Sahba looks 
painfully out of place among the wisps of lace and satin lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Fountain Valley resident stands in his blue jeans and baseball 
cap shifting his weight nervously from foot to foot, hardly glancing at the 
merchandise. Instead, he casts furtive looks to see who might be looking at 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's embarrassing," Sahba says, as he heads for safer ground in the 
Westminster Mall. 
</P>
<P>
"You're looking at underwear," he says. "They might think you're a pervert." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sahba plans to return for a second visit. 
</P>
<P>
"My girlfriend wants me to get her something," he says, "but I have to work up 
the guts to go in and get it." 
</P>
<P>
As Christmas nears, lingerie shops fill up with men, many bearing the same 
pained expression as Sahba while they pick their way through the garters and 
teddies. Some shuffle shamefaced through the perfumed boudoirs with hands 
stuffed in their pockets, not daring to touch any of the undergarments. 
</P>
<P>
Their presence in the stores helps make Christmas the biggest sales period of 
the year for lingerie, topping even Valentine's Day, according to Orange County 
shop owners. So popular has fancy underwear become with women -- and men -- 
that such trips into foreign and feminine territory have become a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frightening," says Jim, a husky, 30-something man who does not look like 
he scares easily. Too embarrassed to use his full name, he lasts only minutes 
among the racy unmentionables at Frederick's of Hollywood before bolting out 
into Westminster Mall. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you uneasy," he says. "I'm turning red already." 
</P>
<P>
Lingerie makes him blush, he says, because "it's not a macho kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
"But my girlfriend likes that kind of stuff," he says. "I like that kind of 
stuff. I bought her something here last year, so I went through the same 
trauma." 
</P>
<P>
Shop owners say they sometimes see men pace back and forth outside their stores 
before they work up the courage to come inside. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a lot of men tell me they had to have a couple of drinks before they 
came in," says Janice Frydrychowski, who owns Fatal Attraction Lingerie &amp; 
More in Dana Point with husband Dan Heredia. 
</P>
<P>
Their initial uneasiness usually wears off when they see other men browsing 
through the bras, according to Mima Ransom, owner of Mima's Lingerie at Fashion 
Island in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"They're darling. They come in a little shy, but once they're here they start 
to relax," she says. "When there are four or five of them, they're like kids in 
a candy shop." 
</P>
<P>
Not all men turn red at the sight of a teddy. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Query of Garden Grove has no qualms about rummaging through the racks of 
garters and G-strings at Frederick's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take one of everything," he announces as he searches for his wife's 
Christmas present. She has issued him a list calling for a teddy, nightie, bra 
and panties right below more practical gifts such as a "new refrigerator." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wears underwear," Query says. "It's silly to get embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
He came away from the shop bearing a see-through lace baby doll trimmed with a 
white boa, a lacy merry widow with matching garters, and his and her G-strings 
made of red velvet with jingle bells attached. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to tell her I got one for myself," he says. "I'm just going to 
surprise her." 
</P>
<P>
Not all men know their way around lingerie the way Query does. For them, much 
of the merchandise remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they pick things off the rack and ask: 'What is this garment used 
for?' " Frydrychowski says. "Or they'll pick up a G-string and ask: 'Where does 
this go?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Many men are familiar with the word teddy and use it to describe everything in 
the store," she says. "I've learned a teddy might mean a camisole, tap pants, a 
nightie or just about anything." 
</P>
<P>
They also have trouble picking lingerie in the right size. One customer bought 
his wife a size 32D bra from Victoria' Secret. She turned out to be a size 36B. 
</P>
<P>
Many describe their wives as "average" and only further questioning by a wise 
salesclerk will reveal she has unusual proportions. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll look at someone who's 5 feet 2, and say: 'She's about your size,' when 
she's really 5 feet 9. It's really cute," Ransom says. 
</P>
<P>
They tend not to notice if their mates have some excess weight that might test 
the limits of a tiny teddy. 
</P>
<P>
"Most are madly in love with their ladies and don't see them from that point of 
view," Ransom says. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Gilbert of Canyon Lake knows what can happen when men pick the wrong size 
negligee. 
</P>
<P>
"My problem is I always buy things too small because they look lousy when 
they're too big," says Gilbert, as he browses through Victoria's Secret in 
South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll buy her something sheer," he says, "then she ends up bringing it back and 
not getting anything like what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Salesclerks often make special efforts to coddle their more helpless customers, 
at times lavishing them with the kind of personal attention not often seen in 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Ransom recently called one man to let him know she had received a pair of silk 
pajamas she thought would be perfect for his wife. She keeps a card file of 
customers' sizes and their preferences for such occasions. The man -- a 
high-level executive -- dashed into Mima's on his lunch hour and bought the 
pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
Last Christmas Eve, her shop was the last in the mall to close so she could 
accommodate tardy Santas. 
</P>
<P>
"Men are notorious last-minute shoppers," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Meaney, salesclerk at Victoria's Secret in Westminster Mall, received 
a call from one distressed man saying he felt uncomfortable walking into a 
lingerie shop. She agreed to meet him at an appointed hour so she could show 
him around. She ended up with a $1,000 sale. 
</P>
<P>
"Men don't even look at prices," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She has a technique for making them feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they're in the store, I start by showing them something that covers, like 
a silk nightshirt. Then they'll say, 'I maybe didn't want sleeves,' so I show 
them something a little more bare. We play this cat-and-mouse game until 
finally it gets down to the littlest thing." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to choosing lingerie, men are not exactly disinterested parties. 
</P>
<P>
"Men are trying to let the ladies know what they want to see them in," 
Frydrychowski says. "They tell me: 'I really want to see my wife in this' or 'I 
know she'd never buy this for herself.' " 
</P>
<P>
So whose gift is it, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
"It's 90% for the men, 10% for the wife," Ransom says. 
</P>
<P>
Yet she has plenty of evidence that women love receiving beautiful lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten calls from couples thanking me. I've gotten flowers. They tell me 
it was one of the most exciting nights. Nine months later, I'll hear the lady 
had a baby." 
</P>

<P>
An outraged nation today drove Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu from power, 
ending the Soviet Bloc's last dictatorship, but loyalist and opposition forces 
battled for control in the streets of Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
Army troops siding with protesters and security forces loyal to Ceausescu 
fought ferocious battles into the night in the capital, Bucharest, and 
elsewhere in the country, East Bloc media reports said. The Presidential Palace 
reportedly was set ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
The tumult capped a historic year of change in the Soviet Bloc that elsewhere 
had been relatively bloodless: Solidarity took power in Poland, Hungary ousted 
its hard-liners and opened its borders, and old-guard regimes in East Germany, 
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria were thrown out in swift succession in October. 
</P>
<P>
State-run Romanian media, now in the hands of protesters, reported that 
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, fled by helicopter from the Presidential Palace 
early today but were later caught and put in detention. Another report, 
however, said he was free and his whereabouts unknown. Still other reports said 
the couple had escaped the country, possibly heading for Iran or China. 
</P>
<P>
Nicu, the Ceausescus' eldest son, was captured after trying to assume command 
of the security forces in Sibiu, the south Transylvanian city he had ruled as 
local Communist Party chief. He said on Romanian TV that he did not know his 
parents' whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 pro-Ceausescu forces attacked Bucharest this evening, after it was 
taken over by hundreds of thousands of protesters, Romanian television 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Dead and wounded are reported from all parts of the city," the Czechoslovak 
news agency CTK said. Yugoslav TV reported hundreds dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Television has appealed to everyone to remain in the streets and to fight 
against the murderers until the very end," the Hungarian news agency MTI said. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year reign of the East Bloc's harshest regime collapsed in one 
breathtaking week of protests that began with a small rally for a persecuted 
pastor in the remote western city of Timisoara, and led to today's nationwide 
uprising by millions. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of unarmed civilians already were believed massacred by troops in 
Timisoara as Ceausescu desperately tried to prolong his rule. Security forces 
also fired on protesters in Bucharest on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet TV said pro-Ceausescu troops attacked at dusk today and fighting raged 
throughout the capital. It said troops opened fire with submachine guns on 
demonstrators who gathered for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
It said the Communist Party Central Committee building was partially blown up. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Romanian radio said tanks and army units surrounded TV and radio 
stations to protect them from loyalist security forces. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian TV showed pictures of Ceausescu's Presidential Palace in flames. 
</P>
<P>
The television reported that Bucharest jails were opened by anti-Ceausescu 
supporters. Engineer Nicu Stefanescu, one of those released, said thousands of 
people had been arrested when the protests swirling through the country finally 
reached Bucharest Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Even children were detained, he said, reporting that there were so many wounded 
in jail that blood was seen in the corridors. 
</P>
<P>
The entire city of Timisoara, where the protests began on Dec. 15 and ignited 
the revolution, seemed to be surging through the streets in celebration. Crowds 
built bonfires fueled by portraits of Ceausescu that had been ripped down. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said that between 2,000 and 4,500 people were killed by security 
forces during efforts in recent days to stop the protests in Timisoara. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something we never expected to happen. The dictator is gone," Ingeborg 
Kziraska, said in front of the local cathedral where she said more than 30 
children were gunned down on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Former Foreign Affairs Minister Corneliu Manescu, 73, went on Romanian TV 
earlier to announce formation of a provisional government until free elections 
are held, the East German news agency ADN said. 
</P>
<P>
Manescu has for many months been under house arrest near Bucharest for 
criticizing Ceausescu, informed sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Several senior military commanders appeared on television to announce 
Ceausescu's ouster, indicating that the army had joined pro-democracy 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
While still in Ceausescu's hands, Romanian radio reported early today that 
Defense Minister Vasile Milea had committed suicide, and blamed him for the 
national unrest. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified general denied on the radio after Ceausescu was ousted that 
Milea had taken his own life, but said that he indeed had died. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu was the last hard-line Soviet alliance leader. With his family he 
strictly controlled the Spartan society he had built and refused to adopt 
reforms despite chronic shortages of food and energy that made life miserable 
for most Romanians. 
</P>
<P>
He apparently felt so secure with the dominance of his cult of personality that 
he traveled to Iran earlier this week during the growing protests, and held a 
pro-government rally on Thursday that turned into a huge chorus of 
denunciations of his rule.

A jury today recommended a 16-year prison sentence for the man convicted of 
causing a fiery crash that killed 27 people on a church bus in the nation's 
worst drunk-driving accident. 
</P>
<P>
Under Kentucky law, Larry Mahoney would have to spend eight years in prison 
before he could be considered for parole. He was tried on 27 counts of murder, 
which carried a life sentence, but the jury convicted him Thursday of 27 counts 
of second-degree manslaughter, a lesser charge. 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney, 36, was composed as he stood to hear Judge Charles Satterwhite read 
each of the sentence recommendations, but he appeared to have tears welling in 
his eyes by the time the judge concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Satterwhite must schedule a formal sentencing. He could give Mahoney a lighter 
sentence than the jury recommended but cannot exceed the jury's recommendation.

Roars of joy erupted and millions of dreams of wealth were shattered today as 
Spain's Christmas lottery, the world's richest, showered $800 million on a few 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
Mesmerized ticket-holders listened for three hours as nervous orphans sang out 
the lucky numbers in a live radio and television broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
The country was at a virtual standstill until it was announced that number 
61714 had won El Gordo ("the Fat One"). The $104-million first prize was 
divided among 80 tickets with that number. 
</P>
<P>
Euphoria exploded and champagne corks popped in Paiporta and Tarrancon, two 
towns of 15,000 that shared in the bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
"I won 50 million pesetas ($430,000)," incredulous teen-ager Jorge Alcantara 
told a radio station. "I don't know what to ask Santa Claus for." 
</P>
<P>
Vicente Piles, the man who sold the lucky tickets in Paiporta and kept one for 
himself, won 10 million pesetas. The former mayor of the city of Lerida who 
shunned sharing a ticket with his centrist colleagues on the City Council lost 
out on their prize of half a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In Cartagena, workers of a liquor factory toasted their $1-million prize with 
their own product. 
</P>
<P>
Bank managers and car salesmen were preparing to descend on the lucky towns. 
Newspapers published special issues with the list of winning numbers. 
</P>
<P>
But all over the country, millions sadly tore up their tickets, hoping for 
better luck next year. 
</P>
<P>
Spaniards spent a staggering $1.08 billion -- an average of $28 per person -- 
on the Christmas lottery, a 171-year-old tradition.

President Bush appealed today to Americans to demonstrate compassion for 
victims of AIDS, saying that a "misplaced fear" of the deadly disease is 
preventing some people from helping. 
</P>
<P>
Bush underscored his point by touring the clinical wards of the National 
Institutes of Health, meeting children ranging in age from less than a year to 
the early teens who are being treated with experimental AIDS drugs. He was 
accompanied by his wife, Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Later, addressing health professionals involved in fighting AIDS, Bush said, he 
wanted to educate "Americans who don't want to help, don't want to become 
involved because of a misplaced fear. They're afraid of holding an AIDS patient 
because they're frightened of getting AIDS."

Western Europe rejoiced today at the downfall of Nicolae Ceausescu, pledging 
immediate aid, and Romania's erstwhile Eastern allies joined in welcoming the 
demise of the Soviet Bloc's last hard-line ruler. 
</P>
<P>
The United States said a "terrible burden" had been lifted from Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev read out a news update from the podium of 
Parliament, and Soviet deputy and space scientist Roald Z. Sagdeyev declared: 
"It's a holiday." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders elsewhere saluted the courage of Romanians who were mowed down by tanks 
and bullets in the uprisings, the only killings in the wave of democracy 
spreading through Eastern Europe. Many pleaded for an end to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, in "a sign of revulsion," and Norway's King Olav 
V each stripped Ceausescu of royal honors awarded a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Romania's exiled King Michael, deposed by the Communists in 1947, told his 
countrymen in a broadcast from Switzerland, "I am and will always remain with 
you." 
</P>
<P>
In dozens of countries, national radio and TV interrupted programs with news 
from Romania and gave constant updates, emanating in stunning detail from East 
Bloc news agencies, including the Soviet Union's Tass press agency. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, a newly emerging East European democracy, opposition leader 
Vaclav Havel pleaded with Romanians "in the name of our velvet revolution" not 
to take violent revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"In our country, there was a slogan shouted, 'We are not like them!' " Havel 
said in a message to Romanians. "You should ask for a just punishment for 
Ceausescu, but not the death penalty. Stop the wave of violence. Otherwise, it 
will flow over all of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, the European Commission of the 12-nation community announced an 
immediate $1.2-million grant in emergency aid to Romania. 
</P>
<P>
The community's foreign ministers, after a hastily convened meeting in Paris, 
promised political cooperation too.

Boeing Co. plans to lay off about 1,200 employees in the first half of 1990, 
with most of the cuts to be made among production workers at Everett, Chairman 
Frank Shrontz said. 
</P>
<P>
Shrontz's comment, in interviews with the Seattle Times and the Morning News 
Tribune of Tacoma, confirmed recent speculation that jobs would be cut. 
</P>
<P>
The exact size of the layoffs or where they might occur has not yet been 
determined, but it will likely be in the general range of 1,200 employees, 
Shrontz said. 
</P>
<P>
"The continued impact of the defense budget on some of our programs has made it 
now look like we can't hold the decline to just attrition and there will be 
layoffs in the first half" of next year, he said. In the early 1970s as many as 
60,000 workers lost their jobs in a two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Shrontz said the company had anticipated a reduction in production workers who 
were needed for start-up work on the 747-400 jetliner, but had not thought 
layoffs would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Increased experience and productivity on the assembly lines is lessening the 
need for more workers, Shrontz said, even though the company is experiencing a 
record surge in orders -- 888 jets worth $46.7 billion this year. There is also 
an $85 billion backlog of more than 1,700 planes.

General Electric Co. says it has won a $500-million contract to build fighter 
plane engines for the government of South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The Koreans plan to buy about 250 F404-GE-402 engines to power 120 FA-18 
fighters, a plane built by McDonnell Douglas, GE announced. The governments of 
Kuwait and Switzerland have purchased smaller numbers of the engine. 
</P>
<P>
"These foreign sales are important because they help offset potential 
reductions in the U.S. defense budget," said Robert Turnbull, GE's vice 
president of military engines. 
</P>
<P>
Turnbull estimated that the plant in Lynn, which will handle the South Korean 
order, will be building 200 F404 engines a year for the next 10 years. He said 
it was likely the U.S. Navy would scale back its purchases in the early 1990s.

PANEL TO PROBE SENATORS WHO AIDED KEATING

The Senate Ethics Committee said today it will conduct a formal investigation 
of five senators who intervened with federal regulators on behalf of Charles H. 
Keating Jr., a wealthy political donor who headed a huge savings and loan 
seized by the government earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Keating case can have an enormous political impact for the senators, who 
have received more than $1.3 million for their campaigns and causes from the 
former head of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine. All have denied 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The committee action will begin a preliminary inquiry as the panel tries to 
determine whether there was a link between the Keating money and the 
intervention by the senators: Majority Whip Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), John 
McCain (R-Ariz.), John Glenn (D-Ohio), Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) and 
Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.). 
</P>
<P>
Federal banking regulators took control of Lincoln on April 14 in what is 
expected to be the nation's worst thrift failure. The cost to taxpayers is 
expected to exceed $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethics Committee had previously hired an outside counsel, Robert Bennett of 
Washington, to determine whether a formal probe should begin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good move," said Murray Flander, press secretary to Cranston. "That's 
something that the Ethics Committee has a total right in its own judgment to 
decide. We aren't at all unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that they are conducting a full preliminary investigation and the 
fact that he will be cleared, this will obviate any charges of whitewash 
afterward." 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we can tell that's what they already are doing," said McCain 
spokesman Scott Selley. 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini commented, 'I welcome a thorough evaluation of the facts and feel 
confident that I will be exonerated." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn is out of town and not immediately available, said assistant press 
secretary Paul Brinkman. 
</P>
<P>
The other senators also could not be reached.

Export Enhancement Program. Terms called for the hard red winter wheat to be 
delivered in February and March.

SKEPTICAL KOVIC SOLD ON FILM

<TEXT>
<P>
Times have mellowed for Ron Kovic, the former Marine paraplegic warrior whose 
life is depicted by Tom Cruise in "Born on the Fourth of July." 
</P>
<P>
Once the angry man who rallied the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, Kovic is 
now occupying himself with art and other creative undertakings. He co-authored 
the script for the autobiographical film with director Oliver Stone. 
</P>
<P>
The movie, which opens this week, outlines Kovic's nightmarish passage from 
all-American boy and superpatriotic soldier to wheelchair activist against the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, he described his joy that Stone, an old friend and 
fellow Vietnam veteran, undertook the task of bringing his life story to film. 
</P>
<P>
Stone's film "Platoon" won four Oscars, including best picture in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he could have done anything he wanted to do," Kovic said of Stone. "He 
was the biggest director in Hollywood, at that time, in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Kovic, 43, said he was at first skeptical about Cruise. Now, he says he is 
astonished at the superstar's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people wondered, 'Could Tom Cruise do it? Could he pull it off?' " Kovic 
said. "When he did, it was just so exhilarating."

MELDING OF 'LEFT FOOT,' DAY-LEWIS 'WAS KIND OF MAGICAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"The evening was sort of darkening," Daniel Day-Lewis says. 
</P>
<P>
"And it was a very white script," he said, that glowed on the doormat of his 
London home. 
</P>
<P>
"So it was kind of magical," he says. "Normally you get some kind of 
accompanying explanation, a letter, or a phone call . . . but this just came." 
</P>
<P>
His smile broadens. "And on the front of this phosphorescent white paper was 
written, "My Left Foot.' I was captured by the title. And the first page, as 
written, was one of the most extraordinary first pages I'd ever read." 
</P>
<P>
The foot belonged to an Irish man, a real one, whose name was Christy Brown, 
who was born with cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's muscles had betrayed him and his mouth required careful training to 
form words that anyone besides his mother might understand. The single reliable 
limb in Brown's body, the limb with which he painted and drew and composed both 
poetry and novels that sold all over Europe, was his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Day-Lewis had heard of Christy Brown -- indeed, he had been mesmerized 
by Brown's story, which he had heard at a party at the home of Irish theater 
producer Noel Pearson. But nothing had come of that conversation until the 
arrival of the glowing script. 
</P>
<P>
And that night, Day-Lewis, still on a publicity tour for his acclaimed role in 
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being," examined scene by scene the utterly 
different emotional and physical work expected of the actor who would play 
Christy Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"I got up now and then and kind of danced for joy," Day-Lewis says, "because I 
hadn't read anything as wonderful as that for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
This week the New York Film Critics Circle voted Day-Lewis best actor and "My 
Left Foot" best picture. 
</P>
<P>
Day-Lewis knows that both he and director-writer Jim Sheridan have delivered 
something extraordinary. He says that he watched the movie in a Dublin theater 
and that the audience reactions alone made the evening unlike any other. "A 
night of madness," he says. "I'll never forget that as long as I live."

Christmas is a special time, a time when one politician can spend tax money 
sending special holiday greetings, and another politician can complain about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Andrew Young sent jumbo Christmas cards this year to 1,500 area 
reporters, ministers, supporters and public officials, including Lt. Gov. Zell 
Miller -- who just happens to be a candidate for governor next year, just like 
the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The 9 by 14 cards, featuring a montage of Atlanta accomplishments, Young's 
smiling face and the legend "Municipal Leader of The Year 1989," cost the city 
a little more than a dollar each to print, and 65 cents to mail. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is inappropriate to spend $1 apiece to send a Christmas card out at 
the city's expense," Miller said. "If the man is elected governor, what will he 
send out in 1991 -- a billboard?" 
</P>
<P>
The response from the Young camp? "What a Scrooge," said press secretary Lee 
Echols.

A 10-year-old Ft. Mill, S.C., girl waiting for a heart transplant was given 
permission to go home for Christmas, but not before she got a stellar sendoff 
from actor Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
"When he came in the room, her heart monitor showed her heart rate went up to 
170 beats a minute," Ginger Mason said. "She was absolutely so excited she 
couldn't stand it." 
</P>
<P>
Cruise, who was filming Paramount Pictures' "Days of Thunder" at Charlotte 
Motor Speedway, brought Brandi Mason a hat and shirt, autographed her 
pillowcase and then visited some of the other children at Charlotte Memorial 
Hospital on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said they don't know when a heart will be available for Brandi, who was 
found to have myocarditis, a rare viral infection of the heart, in July.

Mayor Lionel Wilson said he is not optimistic about the Raiders returning to 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said Thursday that attorneys representing various sides involved in 
discussions about whether the Raiders might return to Oakland from their 
current home in Los Angeles are "at issue on a number of other points (which) 
doesn't help the situation any." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he is not hopeful that the differences can be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we're right back where we were in 1981," he said, referring to 
the year the Raiders played their last game as an Oakland-based team. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland sued Raiders owner Al Davis after he moved the team to Los Angeles but 
lost approximately $9-million worth of legal battles trying to force the 
Raiders to return.

An agreement allowing a single company to supply 90% of the helmets used in 
National Football League games does not violate antitrust laws, a judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
In a 28-page opinion issued Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge James B. Zagel 
refused to issue a permanent injunction halting the agreement between Riddell 
Inc. and NFL Properties, the league's licensing arm. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction was sought by a Litchfield, Ill., company that said it once 
provided 40% of the helmets used by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Under the April, 1988, agreement, Chicago-based Riddell provides free helmets, 
shoulder pads and other gear to the league's 28 teams. In return 90% of a 
team's players use its helmets. Players who wear helmets by other companies 
must conceal those companies' logos. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Schutt Athletic Sales Co. of Litchfield argued that Schutt could be 
forced out of business because the agreement hurt the company's sales of 
helmets to college and high school teams.

Czechoslovak swimmer Marcel Gery was given approval to swim at the 1990 
Commonwealth Games when the federal Cabinet accepted his application for 
Canadian citizenship, a Swimming Canada spokesman said today. 
</P>

Gery, who defected in October, 1986, is a world class freestyle and butterfly 
swimmer. He is expected to boost Canada's medal hopes at the Jan. 24-Feb. 3 
Commonwealth Games at Auckland, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
Gery, who qualified for the Games in the 100-meter freestyle and 100-meter 
butterfly, missed the 1988 Olympics because the Canadian government rejected 
his request for early citizenship, bypassing the customary three-year waiting 
period. He missed the 1984 Olympics when Czechoslovakia boycotted the Los 
Angeles Games.

Ben Johnson and Carl Lewis will meet in a $3.2-million rematch of their Olympic 
100-meter final two days after Johnson's suspension for drug use expires, it 
was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Express, a mass-circulation British newspaper, said U.S. boxing 
promoter Bob Arum was lining up the race in Barcelona for Sept. 25, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how news of this got out," the newspaper quoted Arum as saying. 
"There is a lot of money riding on it. I am not prepared to make any other 
comment." 
</P>
<P>
"People have talked to me about it -- period," Arum told the Associated Press 
by telephone from Las Vegas. "But it's so premature now it's almost laughable." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson beat Lewis in the Olympic final in Seoul in September, 1988, but two 
days later was stripped of the gold medal after testing positive for steroids. 
He was suspended for two years by track's international federation but will be 
eligible to compete internationally next September.

RAIDERS JUGGLE SQUAD FOR KEY FINAL GAME OF REGULAR SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Raiders made a move today to bolster their special teams in advance of 
Sunday's playoffs-deciding game against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Backup safety Russell Carter is hobbled by a hamstring pull, so they placed him 
on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
To replace him on special teams, they waived, then re-signed backup wide 
receiver Timmie Ware, who had been on injured reserve. Ware was ineligible for 
activation unless he cleared waivers. 
</P>
<P>
To fill Carter's role in the six-back defensive scheme on passing downs, they 
will use 14-year veteran Mike Haynes, who has not played since November. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the Raiders plan to start backup Steve Wright at left tackle in 
place of Rory Graves, who has a sprained foot and turf toe. Graves has started 
all 15 games for the Raiders this year, while Wright has been the primary 
offensive line backup at three positions. 
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the importance of the final game on any possible entrance 
into the playoffs, the Raiders also have told backup quarterback Jay Schroeder 
they might go to him for quick relief if starter Steve Beuerlein struggles. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't start him, but I can't say he won't play," said Coach Art Shell. 
"Steve Beuerlein is our starting quarterback, but we're going to do everything 
we can to win this ball game." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder had a history of big cold-weather games when he was the Washington 
starter in 1985-87, including a couple of big games against the Giants.

LARGENT WAS QUITE A CATCH; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: THE SEAHAWKS RECEIVER TAKES A LOAD OF RECORDS WITH HIM INTO 
RETIREMENT. BUT HE LEAVES BEHIND A LEGACY OF DEDICATION.

<P>
The conventional wisdom on Steve Largent in 1976 was that he was too small and 
too slow to make it in the NFL. This weekend he retires after 14 seasons with 
the Seattle Seahawks and after proving he was simply too much for even the best 
defenders in football. 
</P>
<P>
He will take with him every meaningful receiving record and leave behind a 
legacy of lessons in hard work and dedication to the sport that even opponents 
admire. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kind of guy you love to play against," Kansas City defensive back 
Albert Lewis said. "You love to play him for the competition, not as someone to 
get even against. And when he's not playing against you, you root for him. 
That's the kind of guy he is." 
</P>
<P>
At 35, Largent holds six NFL receiving records: career receptions (817), career 
yards (13,048), career touchdowns (100), seasons with 50 or more catches (10), 
seasons with 1,000 or more yards (8) and consecutive games receiving a pass 
(176). He is a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, starting in three games for the 
AFC. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he has struggled, as have the Seahawks, who are 7-8 going into 
Saturday's game against the Washington Redskins. Largent spent six games on 
injured reserve with a broken bone in his right elbow, and has 26 receptions 
for 362 yards, both career lows. 
</P>
<P>
But he came back to get his 100th career touchdown on Dec. 12 against 
Cincinnati, the game in which he surpassed 13,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Largent was picked up by the fledgling Seahawks in their first season. They got 
him from Houston, which cut him because it had a bunch of leggy receivers. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't flashy but perhaps his humility and lack of presence was part of his 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that helped me have the kind of career I have," Largent 
said, "was that I never reached the point where I thought I had arrived." 
</P>
<P>
He can relax now. Friends and former football foes are lining up to tell 
stories of how Largent taught them lessons of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Largent's talents are there, but they lie within rather than in obvious 
physical traits, said Lynn Swann, the former Pittsburgh Steelers receiver who 
now is a television announcer. 
</P>
<P>
Lester Hayes, who retired from the Raiders in 1986, said he clearly remembers 
the first time he laid eyes on the man who redefined zigging and zagging, in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
"I laughed at him," Hayes recalled. "He didn't look like a receiver, he looked 
like an insurance salesman. I thought, 'I should be able to dominate this guy.' 
But I'll tell you what, he is God's gift. I've covered everybody in the NFL -- 
all those high-tech speed guys -- but I've never covered anybody who gave me as 
many problems as Steve Largent did." 
</P>
<P>
Largent was never slow and never small. He still runs 40 yards in 4.6 seconds 
and has used his 5-foot-11, 191-pound frame to tackle opponents. 
</P>
<P>
But it was his ability to twist and turn, and read his opponent, that put him 
at the top of the league. 
</P>
<P>
Largent said he has been asked how he wants to be remembered in football "and I 
always feel like we're drawing up an epitaph. But I'm not dying, I'm just 
moving on to something else." 
</P>
<P>
Just what he will do next is still not definite, Largent said. He has rejected 
the idea of becoming athletic director at Tulsa, he said, which reportedly had 
been a possibility. He will be a commentator with Turner Broadcasting next 
summer when the Goodwill Games are staged in the Seattle area, and there is the 
possibility of doing broadcast work with networks covering the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
He said he's not sure he has the ability to be a sports announcer. But he 
supposedly didn't have the talent to be a pro receiver, either.
