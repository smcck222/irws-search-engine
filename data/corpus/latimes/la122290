IDEA OF USING HANGAR AS SHELTER WAS CASE OF ANY PORT IN A STORM; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS: NOT A SINGLE CHURCH OR RELIEF GROUP THE CITY CONTACTED IN THE VALLEY 
WAS WILLING TO LEASE A BUILDING. SOME SAY THE AREA IS IGNORING THE PROBLEM.

<P>
With oil stains on the floor and a gaping hole in one wall, the cavernous, 
corrugated metal airplane hangar at the Van Nuys Airport was not an obvious 
site for a homeless shelter under the city's cold weather shelter program. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless advocates working with the city turned to the building in desperation 
because, unlike other areas in Los Angeles, they could find no religious 
institutions or community centers in the San Fernando Valley willing to open 
their doors to a large number of homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
The reason -- say city officials, church leaders and homeless advocates -- is a 
combination of poor communication, a failure to recognize homelessness as a 
Valley problem, concerns over security and liability, and fears of upsetting 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a mixture of reasons," said Nancy Bianconi, director of the L.A. 
Family Housing Corp., which is running the shelter under contract with the 
city. "They are fearful of the population they would be serving, it's expensive 
to operate and a lot of the churches felt overwhelmed by this type of 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
The converted hangar opened Friday night after city crews patched the hole in 
the wall, turned on the heat and brought in a phone, portable showers, stove, 
refrigerator and other items needed to create a kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The city's search for a Valley site for a homeless shelter began in earnest the 
first week in October after the National Guard, which had opened armories 
periodically as temporary shelters in past years, decided it would set a bad 
precedent to let them be used for 60 consecutive nights, as the city requested 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Rebuffed, the city Department of Human Services sent 1,100 flyers to social 
service agencies and organizations throughout the city, asking for sites to 
lease as homeless shelters. 
</P>
<P>
There were no responses from the Valley or the Westside, said Bob Vilmur, 
coordinator of city programs for the homeless. Elsewhere in the city, 12 
churches and nonprofit community centers offered to lease space to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Vilmur said the mailing list used for the flyers consisted primarily of 
organizations that in the past have collaborated with the city or received city 
support. That approach overlooked many Valley community organizations and 
churches, some of whose representatives said this week that they did not know 
the city had been seeking shelter space. 
</P>
<P>
"If the issue had come to us and to other churches, we would have responded," 
said James V. Lyles, pastor of First United Methodist Church of Pacoima and 
president of the Ministers Fellowship of the Greater San Fernando Valley. "The 
word never came here, and as far as I know it never came to any of the 40 
churches I am affiliated with," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Smedberg, executive director of the Valley Interfaith Council, which 
represents more than 250 churches, synagogues and other religious institutions, 
said he also was unaware that the city had been searching for a shelter site. 
</P>
<P>
Vilmur defended the city's methods. "There is no way that we could have 
canvassed every temple or church that we might have," he said. But he added 
that city officials did speak to many organized meetings of religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the L.A. Family Housing Corp. individually contacted about 30 churches, 
synagogues and owners of industrial buildings, Bianconi said. All of them 
declined to lease space to the city for use as a shelter, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bianconi said those contacted expressed concerns about security, liability for 
damage to their buildings and the possibility of alienating neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"A suburban community doesn't have an understanding of what the homeless 
population is like in the Valley," she said. "You are not dealing with a Skid 
Row population. They are not usually seriously impaired with drugs or alcohol. 
. . . A lot of fears are unfounded." Bianconi would not identify the 
organizations she had called. Some of those she spoke with asked to remain 
anonymous. She said she did not believe it would be fair to point a finger at 
the others. 
</P>
<P>
Bianconi and Prescilla Ortiz, assistant coordinator of the city's cold weather 
shelter program, said most area churches have not perceived homelessness as a 
chronic problem in the Valley and thus have never provided shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an area that they normally function in on a day-to-day basis," Ortiz 
said. "They have never found themselves in the position of providing continuing 
assistance to homeless persons." 
</P>
<P>
Smedberg said Valley churches making their first forays into sheltering the 
homeless might have been intimidated by the numbers involved. 
</P>
<P>
"One-hundred and fifty people -- that's a pretty big request," he said. "If you 
had talked about a smaller number, you would have gotten a lot more churches 
willing to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Smedberg said Valley religious institutions are trying to address the issue. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, his organization runs a program to pay for homeless 
families to stay in hotels or motels for several nights. During their stays, 
the families are provided with counseling to assist them with their problems. 
Also, he said, four Valley congregations have just established a joint program 
to provide shelter, food and counseling to 12 people for eight weeks beginning 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
John Suggs, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, which 
operates throughout Los Angeles County, said he attributed some of the 
reluctance to a NIMBY, or "not in my back yard," reaction among some church 
leaders and residents who live near the churches. "People don't want to open up 
their communities to provide shelter to the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Left with no other options, Bianconi said her staff decided to examine the 
former Air National Guard that had been occupied by a unit that relocated to 
Point Mugu in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bianconi admitted that she was less than overjoyed when she saw the hangar for 
the first time. Although it is insulated and has central heating, it had a hole 
in one wall to allow the tails of planes to remain outside. 
</P>
<P>
But when they toured all the buildings on the site -- including several 
barracks and the administration building -- they found that the hangar was the 
only one large enough to house 150 people. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to go into a hangar, but we said, 'Oh, God, lets make this 
work,' " Bianconi said. 
</P>
<P>
And work it will, the shelter's staff said, although they admitted that there 
are some problems -- such as lack of sufficient kitchen space -- that cannot be 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
The hangar has two small enclosed offices that Mike Childress, the manager of 
the shelter, said he plans to use as a separate sleeping area for women and for 
a small television lounge. 
</P>
<P>
Childress said he has no qualms about the site. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are talking about taking people off the streets, it doesn't really 
matter what the building was used for before," he said.

OFFICE PARTIES ARE MORE SOBER AFFAIRS THIS HOLIDAY SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRATIONS: HEALTH CONCERNS AND THE CONTINUED CRACKDOWN ON DRUNK DRIVERS HAVE 
PROMPTED COMPANIES TO OFFER RIDES AND NONALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES.

Getting into the spirit of Christmas is less likely to involve imbibing at the 
office party these days, according to a sampling of San Fernando Valley 
businesses, liquor stores and law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
As police set up roadblocks to catch intoxicated revelers heading home from 
office gatherings Friday night, dozens of party-goers said alcohol consumption 
is way down at holiday functions. 
</P>
<P>
"The big decision at our office party was should we have Coke or Pepsi," said 
Bob Walker, vice president of James R. Gary &amp; Co. Ltd. East, a Studio City 
realty office. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a bottle of champagne which we shared between about 10 people, if you 
call that drinking," said Encino personal-injury lawyer Jack Edzant. "I don't 
think they're having the kinds of office Christmas parties that they used to 
have where everybody would walk out of the office stoned." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, at Kinko's Copies in Tarzana, about 30 employees shared one large 
bottle of white wine -- just enough to make a holiday toast -- at a Thursday 
night party, said office manager Kathy Cicciarelli. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want lost lives," Cicciarelli said. "We love our people and don't 
want to see them hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Similar scenes were repeated across the Valley in this alcohol-conscious era of 
stiffer drunk driving laws and sobriety checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police set up a checkpoint on Sherman Way between Canoga and De 
Soto avenues from 5 p.m. to 3 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Other agencies such as the Burbank Police Department and the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department's Santa Clarita Valley station also planned roadblocks to 
catch drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Liquor is still served at most office parties, but far more nonalcoholic 
alternatives are being offered along with it, said Karen Hawk, manager of the 
Liquor Barn in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
"People just are not drinking as much because they're concerned about health 
and somebody's always got to drive home," Hawk said. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers and the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley 
Traffic Division have received calls from office managers seeking advice on how 
to limit employee drinking at office parties or on how to keep drinking 
employees safe after the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Carolee Newman, spokeswoman for MADD'S Los Angeles County chapter, said many 
offices issued memos suggesting that employees select designated drivers to 
remain sober at parties. 
</P>
<P>
Sunkist Growers Inc. of Van Nuys puts out a brochure of recipes for such 
nonalcoholic cocktails as Peach Sunset and Fuzzy White Navel. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more alternatives to alcohol and more social consciousness about the 
consequences of drinking and driving," said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Dennis 
Zine. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol will be served when the 35 employees of Lumber City in Van Nuys have 
their Christmas party tonight at the Van Nuys Holiday Inn, but store manager 
Chris Hatswell said she plans to stay sober so she can drive intoxicated 
employees home if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Some employees have reserved rooms at the hotel so they won't have to drive 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Others are asking spouses to stay sober, store personnel said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think drinking is really looked down upon now," Hatswell said. "God, I hope 
so. Too many people are getting killed by drunk drivers."

LEASH-FREE PARK GIVEN PERMANENT STATUS; 
</P>
<P>
PETS: THERE IS ONLY ONE CATCH: THE PRIVILEGE WILL BE WITHDRAWN IF OWNERS DON'T 
FAITHFULLY CLEAN UP AFTER THEIR DOGS. 
</P>

<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has done its bit to let Rover be Rover. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the Council agreed Friday to designate 4-acre Laurel 
Canyon Park as a permanent haven where dogs may run free, exempt from the 
city's leash law. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one catch -- dog owners were warned that the city would revoke 
their leash-free privileges at the small park if it became apparent that 
"standards for health and safety are not met" -- that is, if dog owners do not 
faithfully clean up after their pets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great -- it only took nine years, but we finally got it," groused Jane 
Purse, who presented the council with a petition that she said contained the 
signatures of 15,000 supporters of the Laurel Canyon dog park. Purse is also a 
founder of ParkWatch, a group of activist dog owners. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, 1988, Laurel Canyon Park -- on the south side of Mulholland Drive 
west of Laurel Canyon Boulevard -- has operated as an experimental leash-free 
park for dogs, the only facility of its kind in Los Angeles. But the city has 
also kept dog-owners on tenterhooks by exempting the park area from the city's 
leash laws only for six months at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Dog owners like Purse and Cathy Doyle, another ParkWatch leader, said dog 
owners deserved a stronger commitment from the city and demanded that the 
park's status be made permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Strongly backing their demand Friday was Councilman Mike Woo, who represents 
the Laurel Canyon area. "The time is past for experiments. It's now time to 
make the status permanent," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Woo's office had earlier agreed to a compromise plan backed by Councilman Joel 
Wachs that would have required the park's leash-free status to be renewed by 
the city annually. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs had said that his concern was that if permanent dog-park status were 
granted, dog owners would grow lax about keeping the park free of litter and 
dog feces and discontinue their funding for park ranger patrols on weekends. 
But Purse pledged that ParkWatch would continue to press cleanliness rules upon 
dog owners and pay for the ranger, and by Friday, Woo had swung Wachs around to 
his view that the park ought to be a leash-free zone unless it becomes a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
ParkWatch leaders said their next goal is to win council approval for similar 
dog parks in other areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said the best way to assure that Laurel Canyon Park does not become a 
nuisance because of a glut of dog owners converging on it is for the city to 
establish other dog parks. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs cited a recent study that said $100,000 would be enough to set up four 
similar facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs can run free at Laurel Canyon Park from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 3 p.m. 
to sundown daily.

L.A. TAKES STEPS TO MEET DWP TERMS FOR FRYMAN DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council acted Friday to meet conditions set by the 
Department of Water and Power on the utility's cooperation in a $10-million 
plan to buy Fryman Canyon in Studio City to prevent houses from being 
constructed there. 
</P>
<P>
The council tentatively agreed to pay the DWP more for its participation and to 
allow the utility to distance itself from the deal, which some council members 
said indicated that the deal provides an improper profit to the canyon's owner. 
</P>
<P>
The Water and Power Commission on Thursday demanded a restructuring of its role 
in the agreement by the city, state park officials and private interests to buy 
the 63-acre canyon from developer Fred Sahadi for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
One of the DWP's key demands was that it be fully reimbursed by the city for 
the properties it is contributing to the purchase. Under the agreement, the 
utility would transfer four of its surplus properties in the Santa Monica 
Mountains to Sahadi as partial payment for Fryman Canyon, located just north of 
Mulholland Drive and west of Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The four parcels were 
most recently valued by the DWP at $1.725 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi also would be paid $6.7 million by the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, the state agency that would maintain and operate Fryman Canyon as 
a park. The remainder of the $10.1-million deal would come from city funds and 
private sources. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the Fryman deal was set up so that the utility would have been paid 
by the conservancy only $61,150 for the four properties. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal tentatively approved Friday by the council, the city will pay 
the DWP $1.725 million for the four parcels and another $2.7 million for a 
fifth parcel that would be transferred to the conservancy as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
But the method of payment was left unresolved, with DWP officials and 
Councilman Michael Woo saying that the intent is for the city to reimburse the 
DWP with as-yet unspecified "in-kind services" -- not in cash. A DWP executive 
later said payment might involve transferring city property to the utility. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP board also insisted that the City Council -- not the DWP board, as 
previously planned -- declare the purchase of Fryman Canyon in the public 
interest and approve the transfer of the DWP properties to Sahadi. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky speculated later that DWP was distancing itself from 
the Fryman Canyon purchase because of lingering questions about whether the 
$10-million price might involve an illegal gift of public funds to Sahadi. The 
most recent state-approved appraisal of the canyon set its value at $8.75 
million. 
</P>
<P>
But DWP executive Mike Moore rejected Yaroslavsky's interpretation. "We're not 
in the parks business, we are in the water and power business," Moore said. 
That being the case, it is not appropriate for DWP to determine if the public 
interest necessitates the purchase of Fryman Canyon for a park, he said. 
"That's a council decision."

PUBLIC DANGERS IN ANGELES FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We in the Angeles National Forest would like to express our appreciation for 
the story by Jeff Meyers ("Forest's Fatal Toll on Visitors," Nov. 10) because 
we need all the help we can get in raising the public's awareness of potential 
dangers when visiting the national forest. Your reporter expressed the opinion 
that "signs equal safety." Nothing could be further from the truth. To follow 
the premise that "signs equal safety" is to ignore an individual's personal 
responsibility for his or her own actions. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sad fact that alcohol and drug abuse is a mitigating factor in a 
substantial number of serious or fatal injuries on the forest. The Angeles 
National Forest has taken steps in many cases to try to reduce the number of 
accidents related to the volatile mix of recreation and substance abuse. Often 
these public safety actions are misinterpreted as barriers to recreation 
opportunities. Moving an access gate to three-quarters of a mile away from a 
recreation site might be interpreted as a barrier, yet this simple action has 
cut the accident rate at San Antonio Falls significantly. There have been no 
recent serious injuries or deaths at this location. 
</P>
<P>
Signs alone will not ensure public safety. It is doubtful that a sign would 
have prevented a 12-year-old from wandering away from his group camp or 
discouraged a teen-ager from diving off a waterfall on a dare. Safety is a 
major concern of the Forest Service. Facts and figures on forest accidents, 
injuries and fatalities are available from numerous sources. The Forest Service 
keeps extensive records in the law enforcement system and with the radio 
dispatcher's office in Arcadia. In addition, when serious or fatal injuries 
occur, the L.A. County Sheriff's Department keeps its own official version of 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service Law Enforcement Coordinator Chuck Shamblin was misquoted when 
the story said, "There have been 60-100 accidental deaths at Switzer Falls in 
the last two decades." The correct quote is, "There have been 60 to 100 serious 
accidents or fatalities on the Arroyo Seco Ranger District and about seven 
serious injuries or deaths at Switzer Falls." The error was unfortunately 
compounded when you printed the same misinformation in your editorial "Danger 
in Them Thar Hills" (Nov. 17). 
</P>
<P>
The Forest Service efforts to promote public safety are well-documented. 
</P>
<P>
No single effort is guaranteed to work alone. As long as there are wild lands 
so close to an urban area the size of Los Angeles, regretably there will 
continue to be those who use the land without respect to its inherent dangers. 
The mission of the Forest Service, "Caring for the land, serving the people," 
requires a balance of responsibility, both from agency employee and forest 
user.

VALLEY LEGISLATORS CHOSEN TO HEAD MAJOR PANELS

Three San Fernando Valley-area Democrats will serve as chairmen of major policy 
committees when the Legislature reconvenes next month, Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Brown elevated Assemblyman Burt Margolin, whose district includes Universal 
City and parts of Burbank and North Hollywood, to head a new Insurance 
Committee and named Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman -- who represents Sherman 
Oaks, Topanga and other Santa Monica Mountain areas of the western San Fernando 
Valley -- as chairman of the Labor and Employment Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing to serve as Assembly Transportation Committee chairman will be 
Richard Katz of Sylmar. Brown had previously reappointed Assemblyman Tom Bane 
(D-Van Nuys) to guide the Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Brown issued the announcement before the Christmas holiday, in part, to end 
speculation about the posts, said Michael Reese, the speaker's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
For example, earlier in the week, Assemblyman Tom Hayden had announced he was 
giving up the labor panel and assuming the chairmanship of a new Higher 
Education Committee, amid speculation that lawmakers were urging Brown to 
punish the Santa Monica Democrat for allegedly neglecting his duties. 
</P>
<P>
Hayden will be replaced by Friedman, who voiced pleasure at being named to 
oversee a full policy committee for the first time since his election in 1986. 
Friedman said he expects his committee to be at "the center of many big 
issues," especially because of the current economic downturn. 
</P>
<P>
In his labor post, Friedman said he anticipates fashioning legislation to 
ensure workers receive adequate notice of plant closures and, if necessary, 
provide them job retraining. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker said he also expects to stress worker health and safety 
legislation and focus on employment discrimination, including proposals to 
require equal employment opportunities for homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
Margolin and Katz could not be reached for comment.

SERIES ON PRESS AND MINORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I commend David Shaw for his article "Negative News and Little Else," 
(four-part series on minorities and the press, Dec. 11-14). 
</P>
<P>
I am 27 and a black male and even though I am college-educated and have never 
been incarcerated, my image is the epitome of a drug addict, drug dealer and 
rapist perpetuated by the press. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, objectivity must be the goal of any journalist if the press is to 
inform and educate. But objectivity can only be achieved if there is 
"integrity" in the reporting of facts and context. Incorrect or biased 
reporting can only lead to incorrect and biased perceptions. This is true with 
any news issue, but especially when reporting on minorities.

SAHARA CLUB AND DESERT ENVIRONMENTALISTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Sahara Club, a group of plant-crushing motorcycle enthusiasts is aptly 
named. 
</P>
<P>
Large portions of the Sahara desert and other eroded wastelands of North Africa 
are man-made. In historical (that is, Roman Empire) times, many now ugly and 
hostile areas of North Africa were verdant and friendly. They became deserts 
after men cut down all of the trees and their goats nibbled all of the smaller 
plants out of existence.

Rick Sieman says he wants his Sahara Club "to be the organization that people 
can come to get the real facts." One wonders where he expects to get these 
facts. 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious he doesn't subscribe to any popular science or news magazines, or 
even read the newspaper. Otherwise, he'd realize that "the same clowns who were 
warning you about the planet freezing over 20 years ago (and) are now babbling 
about global warming" are not "eco-freaks" but scientists. Scientific data 
supported each of these predictions, and scientific principles are always 
changing based on new evidence obtained from ongoing research. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists, not "eco-freaks," also have data based on years of ongoing studies 
that the annual Barstow to Vegas motorcycle race harms the desert ecosystem and 
habitat for the threatened desert tortoise. Sieman's so-called "eco-freaks" 
merely support well-founded scientific results; they do not create them.

A recent case (of selective journalism) is the lack of coverage of the Screen 
Actors Guild's presentation of the "Annual Career Achievement Award" on Dec. 9 
to the prominent black actor Brock Peters. The 70,000 members of SAG honored 
Peters for his acting and humanitarian achievements during his lengthy career. 
I assume that other stories such as the one about abandoned cats in Oceanside 
left little room.

I was in the process of writing a letter to you when the paper with the Shaw 
article was delivered. I wanted to tell you how irresponsible your paper is in 
regard to the black community. Any newspaper that exercised an un-American 
policy of censorship in totally ignoring the Louis Farrakhan speech, which 
attracted 30,000-35,000 people, and then spent many editorial lines on a trite 
story about black reparations needs to examine its editorial policy and its 
lack of journalistic fairness.

Shaw's effort to demonstrate how the American press contributes to a climate of 
fear and mistrust regarding Asian Americans and Japan ("Asian-Americans Chafe 
Against Stereotype of 'Model Citizen'," Dec. 11) is laudatory, but I suggest 
The Times take a critical peek at its own participation in this trend. 
</P>
<P>
On the day before Shaw's article appeared, a front-page headline opined, 
"Japan's Thirst for Hollywood Is Unquenched," conjuring an image of Japan as a 
devouring, unstoppable beast preying upon unsuspecting innocents. And The Times 
subscribes to the comic strip "Beetle Bailey," in which Japanese-American 
Corporal Yo is portrayed as a neurotically over-achieving, greedy 
perfectionist, a depiction which could fairly be construed as racist.

BULLS BREAK AWAY FROM LAKERS IN FOURTH QUARTER; 
</P>

PRO BASKETBALL: WITH 33 POINTS AND 15 REBOUNDS, JORDAN IS HERE, THERE AND 
EVERYWHERE WHEN IT COUNTS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wrong time, wrong place, maybe wrong decade. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, eager to make up for their lost night in Cleveland, had too much on 
their hands Friday night. Start with the one, the only Michael Jordan, who had 
33 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists, leading the Bulls to a 114-103 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Only one team's funk could end and it was Chicago's. The Bulls were coming off 
a demoralizing rout at Detroit that had Coach Phil Jackson hinting at lineup 
changes and Jordan hinting he wasn't happy. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls feel a lot better this morning. Meanwhile, the Lakers are 14-9, third 
in the Pacific Division, on a two-game losing streak, in a flat spot as they 
try to evolve from earthbound caterpillar to lovely butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
During their early slump, Magic Johnson said he was "an impatient man when it 
comes to winning." 
</P>
<P>
Is his patience being tested? 
</P>
<P>
"Very much so," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The next step for the Lakers involves returning to their fast-break ways and 
getting more play from their bench, so they don't ride Johnson and James Worthy 
into the ground by March. 
</P>
<P>
From that standpoint, as Mike Dunleavy likes to say, Friday night wasn't a 
total bust. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, the Lakers ran. Their bench -- read A.C. Green and Larry Drew -- 
played commendably in the first half. Green scored 12 points in seven minutes 
of the first quarter. Drew made his only shot and had two assists. For the 
first time this season in a tight game against a quality opponent, Johnson 
rested and the Lakers gained ground while he was out, going from a 35-33 
deficit at the start of the second quarter to a 46-44 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are two halves in a game. The Bulls broke the game open with 
Johnson on the bench, with a 7-0 burst early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to lose," Dunleavy said, "but I thought we have a good effort. I 
thought the Bulls had a hell of an effort and beat us. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago's a good team. They just played better than we did tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted this game. We gave a good effort. I'm proud of the effort we gave." 
</P>
<P>
At least, they looked like the Lakers, for a while. While solidifying their 
defense and learning their offense, they had settled into a half-court team, 
playing to the post-up strengths of Worthy, Johnson and Sam Perkins. But 
Friday, they came out running. 
</P>
<P>
They kept running, until one of the Bull guards took over the offensive boards 
and gave the Lakers' break the rest of the night off. Can you guess which one 
it was? 
</P>
<P>
No, it wasn't B.J. Armstrong. It was Jordan, who had eight offensive rebounds, 
half his team's total. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael's cat-quick," Johnson said. "But the thing about Michael people don't 
know, he's so strong. 
</P>
<P>
"We got good transition tonight. We killed ourselves after the first period. We 
let them get second shots. Before that, we'd let them get one shot and we were 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers trailed, 56-52, at halftime, then kept the game close in the third 
quarter by raining three-point baskets on their hosts -- five in five tries, 
two by the ever-surprising Perkins, two by Johnson, one by Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Guess who started to take over then? 
</P>
<P>
Try this sequence: Jordan comes flying down the baseline into a traffic jam in 
the lane; Jordan puts up a miracle layup you couldn't even imagine and misses; 
Jordan gets his own rebound; John Paxson winds up taking a jump shot and 
missing; Jordan gets this rebound, too, and scores on a 10-foot jumper. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, here's another only-you-Michael sequence: Jordan comes flying in 
for another miracle-layup attempt, misses, gets his own rebound, goes up again 
but has the shot blocked by college teammate Perkins. Cliff Levingston 
rebounds, however, and scores. 
</P>
<P>
Leading 92-89 in the fourth quarter, the Bulls broke it open this way: Horace 
Grant scores on a layup on a pretty pass from Scottie Pippen, is fouled and 
makes the free throw; Grant blocks Mychal Thompson's layup and Pippen makes a 
fast-break dunk; Drew misses a long jumper and the Bulls run again, with Stacey 
King scoring on the layup. Suddenly, it's 99-89. 
</P>
<P>
A new era in the Laker-Bull rivalry? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the holdover," Johnson conceded, smiling. "No question about it, it's a 
new era. We've got new faces, a new coach. It's a whole different thing this 
year. We have Sam Perkins, Terry Teagle. We have three rookies. We've never had 
three rookies since I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
To see how the new era evolves, stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
For Terry Teagle, the struggle continues. He missed both his shots Friday and 
was two for 12 on the trip. . . . Before this trip, Magic Johnson was shooting 
21% on three-point attempts. On the trip, he went nine for 15. . . . The 
Lakers' next game: Minnesota Sunday night at the Forum.

TRAIL BLAZERS LEAVE CLIPPERS IN THE DUST; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: AFTER A TIE SCORE AT HALFTIME, PORTLAND PULLS AWAY TO A 117-107 
VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Clippers returned to the Sports Arena Friday night after a 1-5 trip and 
went into their Wizard of Oz routine for a while. 
</P>
<P>
But their "no place like home" act lasted only a half. Then they got the 
tornado treatment from the Portland Trail Blazers, who clearly were in no mood 
for a close game after a rare reintroduction to defeat the night before. So the 
Trail Blazers ended this one early in the second half with a blast from the 
past of most every Clipper, turning a tie score into a runaway and eventually a 
117-107 victory before 13,858. 
</P>
<P>
"The elite teams, after a disappointing game, come out the next time and show 
what happened was a mistake," said Portland center Kevin Duckworth, who had 17 
points and 10 rebounds. "That's what it is all about." 
</P>
<P>
This Clipper-Trail Blazer rivalry, or what passes for one, is about such 
outcomes. In the teams' 25 meetings, Portland has won 24, the last eight of 
them in a row. This time the Trail Blazers had double-figure scoring from six 
players to improve to a league-best 23-3 and move 6 1/2 games up on 
second-place Phoenix in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
What made this one different was that the Clippers appeared destined for a 
commendable showing, at least until the second half began. That's when the 
Trail Blazers, who missed two slam dunks and several other shots within a few 
feet during the opening two quarters, had a 22-4 run in the first 5:49 of the 
third quarter. It turned a 53-53 halftime score into a distant memory. 
Portland's burst continued until it scored on 13 consecutive possessions while 
the Clippers made one of their first 12 shots, giving the Trail Blazers an 
80-62 lead. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Clippers were outscored, 42-21, in the third quarter. The Trail 
Blazers' lead peaked at 24 points, 98-74, with 11:21 remaining when Clyde 
Drexler's jump shot accounted for three of his 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them today a lot of times teams finish a long road trip and come home 
and relax," Coach Mike Schuler said of his Clippers. "I told them we weren't 
going to do that. I said this is too important a game. And the first half they 
did play like that. I admit they really fooled me coming out for the second 
half. I didn't expect to see that at all. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had the answer to what happened in the third quarter, I would certainly 
give it to you and be able to do something about it. . . . We were absolutely 
as flat as anybody could be." 
</P>
<P>
Because of it, today they're a little bit lower, too. By losing for the fifth 
time in a row and the seventh time in their last eight games, the Clippers 
(10-15) dropped into sixth place in the seven-team Pacific, 2 1/2 games away 
from last-place Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The one step up came from Bo Kimble, who needed it most. The rookie guard, in 
his second game off the bench after having gone 16 of 55 (29.1%) the previous 
eight outings, made nine of 18 shots for a team-high 24 points in his best 
showing in weeks. That included a season-high three three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Outside shooting was a key to the Clippers' strong first half. Jeff Martin, who 
missed all six of his shots Wednesday when he replaced Kimble in the lineup, 
went five of seven before intermission. But Martin was shut out in 10 minutes 
of action in the second half, when he took only three more shots. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Manning had 21 points and 10 rebounds for the Clippers. Ken Norman added 
19 and 12 and Loy Vaught 14 and 11, respectively. Gary Grant had 12 assists, 
but only one in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"No team should come into our house and do what they did to us," Norman said. 
"In order for us to get to the level Portland is, we need to work much harder, 
in practice situations and game situations." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Benjamin remains day-to-day in his recovery from oral surgery, but he 
said before the game he will probably miss Sunday's contest against Sacramento 
and return Wednesday against the Lakers at the Sports Arena. He supposedly has 
dropped enough weight to reach the mid-260s, where the Clippers wanted him, but 
has not worked out since having four wisdom teeth extracted Dec. 9. The 
sixth-year center started back on solid food four days ago, and Thursday and 
Friday he skipped planned sessions of riding a stationary bicycle because of 
dizziness and a painful mouth. Benjamin missed a $100,000 bonus when he failed 
to show up for the first day of training camp at or below 265 pounds and 
recently has been in the 280s. The Clippers' reaction has been to hold off on 
starting negotiations for a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Hersh, the Clipper director of marketing, resigned to become team 
services manager for the NBA. She has been with the organization 5 1/2 seasons. 
. . . The Clippers averaged only 96.5 points on their just-completed trip. . . 
. Friday marked the debut of a pair of new scoreboards in the Sports Arena 
known as the Hustle Board. Each will keep track of rebounds, blocked shots and 
steals for both teams.

<P>
The Rams' reputation for front-office stinginess and shortsightedness far 
predates John Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson provided stability and respectability to an organization that had 
become a laughingstock. He is a charismatic, popular leader who knows the game, 
and for several seasons has gotten exceptional performances from players who, 
for the most part, possess average talent. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams don't need a new coach. They need ownership whose first priority is 
fielding a championship football team, and isn't afraid to pay the people to 
get the job done.

Come on, L.A. sportswriters. If you can't find fault with John Robinson the 
coach, you surely can comment on his erudition. 
</P>
<P>
When he talked about Cleveland Gary's fumbling problems, he said: "We might 
have to give him some time to recover his ground." 
</P>
<P>
When commenting on the remainder of the season for the Rams, he said. "This is 
a team that has to see itself on a larger concept." Now what does all that 
mean?

If verbiage were a snowflake, Robinson would be a blizzard.

So Hubie Brooks is upset by the trade sending him from 1991's top contending 
team back to the New York Mess. His warning to the Dodgers that they have 1% 
that could ruin a very good team comes from a player unable to remember how 
many outs there were, allowing Brett Butler to score the winning run in a game 
at Candlestick Park last season crucial to the Dodgers' comeback hopes. Come 
on, Hubie, leave with the dignity everyone expects from such a nice guy.

MILLER LEADS FULLERTON WOMEN PAST USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a game in which both teams were as cold as the weather, Genia Miller scored 
26 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead Cal State Fullerton to a 61-55 
victory over USC in women's basketball Friday night at Lyon Center. 
</P>
<P>
Claudette Jackson added 19 points for Fullerton (6-2), which capitalized on 
free-throw shooting, hitting 21 of 32 to seven of 13 for the Trojans (3-4). 
</P>
<P>
Both teams shot poorly from the field, Fullerton hitting 10 of 40 shots (25%) 
and the Trojans hitting nine of 34 (26.4%). 
</P>
<P>
The Titans held freshman Lisa Leslie to a career-low nine points in 24 
foul-plagued minutes. 
</P>
<P>
USC trailed most of the game but tied it, 47-47, midway through the second 
half. The Titans scored their last eight points on free throws.

HOOSIERS GET A TIMELY LIFT AND EXTEND STREAK

<P>
When Indiana needed a lift in the second half Friday night against Iowa State, 
Calbert Cheaney and Eric Anderson provided it. 
</P>
<P>
Cheaney scored 18 of his 29 points in the second half and Anderson had nine of 
his 18 during a 19-4 run that enabled the sixth-ranked Hoosiers to beat the 
Cyclones, 87-76, at Ames, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana (10-1) blew a 10-point lead in the first half, fell behind at the start 
of the second half, but then took control of the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoosiers, who extended their winning streak to eight games, made 12 of 
their first 17 shots in the second half and shot 65.4% over the final 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we played pretty well in the second half, almost from the beginning 
right on through," Indiana Coach Bob Knight said. "We had a little bit better 
movement, we got the ball into the kind of shot positions we wanted and we were 
able to play with a little bit more patience once we got an eight- or 10-point 
lead." 
</P>
<P>
No. 18 Kentucky 84, Western Kentucky 70 -- The Wildcats (6-2) made only nine of 
36 three-point attempts at Louisville, Ky., but their defense forced 26 
turnovers that resulted in 31 points in their first regular-season game against 
the Hilltoppers (2-6). 
</P>
<P>
The schools had met twice in the NCAA tournament, with Western Kentucky 
winning, 107-83, in 1971, and Kentucky winning, 71-64, in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OTHER HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>

TITAN WRESTLERS EDGE OKLAHOMA ON FINAL MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Jones scored a major decision victory in the heavyweight division to give 
Cal State Fullerton a 20-19 nonconference wrestling victory over Oklahoma 
Friday night at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (3-3) had a 16-13 lead going into the 190-pound match, in which 
Fullerton's Derrick Brown was disqualified when he bit Andy Foster to get out 
of a painful hold. 
</P>
<P>
The disqualification gave Oklahoma (1-2) a 19-16 lead, but Jones' 12-2 victory 
over Joe O'Mara was worth four points and the victory. 
</P>
<P>
In the first five individual matches, Titans Michael Grubbs, Jeff Maes, Lyndon 
Campbell and Marty Kouyoumtjian all won by decision, and Donnie Kiernan 
wrestled to a 7-7 draw with William Gay in the 142 class. But Oklahoma won 
three and had a draw in the next four weight classes to set up the deciding 
heavyweight match.

NORTH HOLLYWOOD TOURNAMENT;

ALLEN, GRANADA HILLS THWART STUBBORN GRANT, 63-56

<P>
Granada Hills High benefited from Grant's cold shooting and untimely turnovers 
in the fourth quarter Friday night to score a 63-56 victory over the Lancers in 
a semifinal game of the North Hollywood tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders (9-1) owned a 51-50 lead after three quarters and held Grant to 
just six points in the final period to advance to today's 7 p.m. championship 
game against El Camino Real. The Conquistadores defeated North Hollywood, 
64-44, in the other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
It looked as if Grant would get a break when Granada Hills' Jerry Allen, who 
finished with a game-high 23 points, picked up his fourth foul with one minute, 
18 seconds left in the third quarter. Allen already had his 23 points, but 
Coach Bob Johnson wanted Allen on the floor for the final period. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Johnson told me, 'You gotta play soft, but we need you on offense,' " 
Allen said. "I kept my hands in my pocket. I had to. I wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
Fearful of committing a fifth foul, Allen never attempted a shot in the fourth 
quarter. Instead, he dished out assists to Gene Barshtak and Adrian Sellers, 
and controlled the tempo on offense. 
</P>
<P>
Grant's Brunell Mori, who finished with 16 rebounds and a team-high 16 points, 
tied the score, 54-54, with 5:25 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lancers were scoreless for five minutes, allowing Granada Hills to post 
a 9-0 run for a 63-54 lead. Ryan Cravens' three-point play and Sellers' 10-foot 
jump shot keyed the Highlanders' run. 
</P>
<P>
Barshtak's slam with 29 seconds left punctuated the victory. George Vicuna 
stole the ball from David Knight at midcourt and passed to Barshtak, who 
slammed it through with both hands. 
</P>
<P>
Grant (6-2) turned the ball over three times down the stretch and failed to 
score off six offensive rebounds in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills led, 16-13, after the first quarter but fell behind, 38-31, late 
in the second period after Grant put together a 7-0 run behind Sean McMahon's 
four points and Eric Brown's fourth three-point basket of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was four of four from three-point range in the second quarter and 
finished with 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders outscored Grant, 12-2, in the opening minutes of the third 
period for a 44-40 lead and led by one with eight minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon finished with 14 points for the Lancers, and Sellers scored 16 for 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Grant plays North Hollywood for third place today at 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real 64, North Hollywood 44 -- The Conquistadores' inside game proved 
too tough for the Huskies, who played without Eric Jackson, who sustained a 
broken left wrist Thursday against Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, the Huskies' best inside player and rebounder, could only watch as El 
Camino Real took apart the Huskies (6-3) on both sides of the court. Jackson 
will wear a cast for the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Markee Brown scored 14 points for El Camino Real (6-1), and teammates Adam 
Kodish and Sam Sarpong each scored 11. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood's only double-figure scorer was Robert Hill, who scored 12 
points in the first half but was held to just six in the second to finish with 
a game-high 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 66, Poly 47 -- Marquis Burns scored 16 points and James Pigford added 13 
to lead the Regents (3-4) past Poly (2-6) in a semifinal consolation game. 
</P>
<P>
The Regents led, 31-17, at halftime and limited Poly to nine or fewer points in 
each of the first three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Steve McCann's 13 points and Juan DeLuna's 10 paced the Parrots. 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff 69, Chatsworth 65 -- Ignacio Castro scored 27 points as Bell-Jeff 
(4-4) advanced to the consolation championship against Reseda today at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by 10 points at the end of three quarters, Bell-Jeff outscored 
Chatsworth, 25-11, in the fourth quarter for the victory. The Guards converted 
all 12 of their free throws in the period. Castro made seven free throws and 
Brian Lee, who finished with 18 points, was five of five. Chatsworth is 4-3.

CASSIDY TRYING TO HARNESS CSUN'S UNBRIDLED SPEED ON OFFENSE

<P>
Could an old basketball coach really learn new tricks? Furthermore, could he 
teach them? 
</P>
<P>
Inquiring minds wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Cassidy had coached Cal State Northridge basketball for 19 previous 
seasons and rarely uttered the words "run" and "gun" in the same sentence. 
Unless, of course, he was threatening to use the latter if his players chose to 
do the former. 
</P>
<P>
That was supposed to change this season. Northridge, in its inaugural Division 
I campaign, was going to play Loyola Marymount-style. Two passes -- maximum -- 
and launch. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors would trap on defense and fast break on offense. The ball would be 
treated as if it were a live grenade. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy talked to the experts, Denver Nuggets Coach Paul Westhead, who had 
installed the system at Loyola Marymount, and Redlands Coach Gary Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's forte early in his coaching career had been defense. Now he was 
committed to the running style. That intrigued Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary, what do you do if you can't break? What do you run half court?" Cassidy 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith: "We don't have a half-court offense." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy gasped. 
</P>
<P>
Was he ready for this? 
</P>
<P>
Even the Northridge players wondered. "He's always had a tight grip on what 
goes on on the floor. Now it's so helter-skelter and he's got to depend on us a 
little more," center Todd Bowser said. "He's in transition just like we are. I 
guess it's kind of like letting a daughter go out on that first date. It's 
tough to let go." 
</P>
<P>
But Cassidy did. In its opener at Colorado, Northridge attempted 44 three-point 
shots -- and lost by 24 points. Then came a 25-point loss to Colorado State and 
a 58-point thrashing at the hands of New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors weren't running and gunning as much as they were chasing and 
panting. 
</P>
<P>
The players, Cassidy said, were thinking too much. Or not thinking at all. 
Playing jail-break basketball, it seemed, was like attempting to understand the 
lyrics of a song on fast forward. Often the result was garbled. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're playing against people who are better than you are, like New 
Mexico State, people who are so much quicker, it's devastating if you hesitate 
a moment," Cassidy said. "Your advantage is gone. We just don't know the system 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Westhead's Nuggets were routinely getting buried by an 
NBA-record avalanche of points. Ditto for college programs such as Loyola 
Marymount and others that attempted to emulate the Lions' style. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jim Harrick of UCLA called it a disease. He wondered aloud where "the 
purity and the finesse and the beauty" of college basketball had gone. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've got the horses Jim Harrick does, you can say anything you want," 
was Cassidy's reply. 
</P>
<P>
The system would not be scrapped, only adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaches are notorious thieves, stealing from each other," Cassidy said. "And I 
don't mind telling you I've stolen a lot from Westhead and Gary Smith. But 
there's still going to be a little bit of me in there. Some things I just can't 
let go of." 
</P>
<P>
Things like a half-court offense. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, the "me" in Cassidy has begun to emerge more noticeably. The points 
have begun to dwindle. Not CSUN's as much as its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six games of the season, the Matadors allowed an average of 106.5 
points a game while scoring 81.7. The past two games those averages are 80.5 
and 78, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (2-6) has won two of its past five games, including an 83-73 
decision over the University of San Diego at home last week. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, which had five wins and losses to only Indiana and UC Santa Barbara 
coming into the game, was the preseason favorite to win the West Coast 
Conference. Loyola Marymount, Pepperdine and Santa Clara are among the 
conference's other schools. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge has not scrapped its up-tempo style completely. But the Matadors 
have become more selective. Cassidy calls it opportunistic. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things we are learning to flow into that still allows us to be an 
early offense," Cassidy said. "You can get a shot off within three or four 
seconds on the first move and it takes only three more seconds to swing the 
ball and have one or two or three other scoring opportunities along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not perceptively slowing the ball down. We're just making the extra pass 
or two to get the good shot." 
</P>
<P>
Faster, the Matadors have found, does not necessarily mean better. 
</P>
<P>
"The commitment it takes to play that kind of basketball is tremendous," 
Cassidy said. "It's not my personality to be that way and that's what probably 
is prohibiting us from committing totally to that kind of style." 
</P>
<P>
That and a need for taller, quicker players with better ballhandling skills. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Northridge appears to have found a tempo it can live with. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps even win with. 
</P>
<P>
The skin game: One of the topics Cassidy discusses with students in his 
"Theories of Coaching" class at Northridge is how to deal with criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've been in this business as long as I have, there has been a lot of 
criticism," Cassidy said. "I tell them it's like Dale Carnegie said, 'Any fool 
can criticize, condemn and complain . . . and most fools do.' It's life. It's 
part of the coaching profession. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I tell them is that everyone up there is a coach and you have 
to be thick-skinned. If you're thin-skinned in this profession, you probably 
won't last long. You have to understand that people aren't in the know. They 
just don't know. They haven't walked in your shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Still afloat: Northridge's swimming and diving teams have kept their records 
above sea-level in their first season at the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
The Matador men's and women's teams have identical 3-2 records. 
</P>
<P>
The women, paced by Cecilia Henricksen with wins in the 200-yard individual 
medley (2:16.48) and 200-yard butterfly (2:12.67), were particularly impressive 
in a 109-95 loss to UC Santa Barbara, the defending champion of the Big West 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: Northridge's preseason ranking of 22nd by Baseball America is striking 
considering the Matadors have never played a game as a Division I team. "As far 
as I'm concerned, this is the biggest thing that has happened since I've been 
here, even bigger than playing for the Division II championship," Coach Bill 
Kernen said. "Establishing ourselves as a Division I program is what we've been 
working on for the past 19 months." 
</P>
<P>
Tory Stephens put up some startling shooting numbers in Valley's first 10 
games. Stephens made 99 of 165 field-goal attempts (60%), including a 
respectable 20 of 51 (39.2%) from three-point range. Take away the three-point 
baskets and Stephens, a sophomore guard, is 79 of 114 -- that's 69.3%. He is 
averaging 20.5 points a game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Western State Conference's ninth-best assist man, averaging 3.4 a game, is 
Glendale's Mike Cassidy, son of Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy. . . . 
</P>

all she did was lead the nation with 30 goals.

GRANDPA AND NEW KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am Frank Sinatra's granddaughter and I'm writing about the article (Morning 
Report, Nov. 28) about my grandfather and the New Kids on the Block. First of 
all, I am 15 years old, not 12, and there must have been some misunderstanding 
about me and the New Kids. 
</P>
<P>
I told my grandpa that I thought it was a good idea if he made a recording with 
them, but I am not a "rabid New Kids fan" and it was not what I "wanted for 
Christmas." The credit should go to my grandfather because he asked me, or told 
me, about the idea months ago. I had nothing to do with it. He must have 
thought that I was a fan, but I really am not. The whole thing wasn't even my 
idea, so I shouldn't get any credit. 
</P>
<P>
I would appreciate it if this could be cleared up . . . and if you want to know 
who my favorite singer is, it's my grandpa!

I'm sure not everyone remembers this, but the reactions to three of the 
greatest films of the 1960s -- "Bonnie and Clyde," "2001" and "The Wild Bunch" 
-- were decidedly mixed. People either hated them or loved them; there was no 
middle ground. But with the passage of time all three are now considered 
classics.

Nevertheless, like some voodoo witch doctor, Don Wildmon frightens sponsors 
into thinking something evil will happen to them if they don't do his bidding. 
Again, how sad for the sponsors, since there is a huge untapped market of

TRASH CAN SINATRAS DO IT THEIR WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Sinatra just celebrated his 75th birthday and marked more than 50 years 
in show biz. The Scottish band Trash Can Sinatras, as the name forecasts, will 
likely prove a bit more disposable. 
</P>
<P>
But the quintet's Los Angeles debut at Club Lingerie on Thursday did make for 
an entertaining and promise-filled 50 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
That came as a pleasant surprise, following a spate of such British bands as 
the Sundays and the Heart Throbs that set high expectations with excellent 
records but couldn't connect live, and following the Sinatras' own tasty but 
hardly gripping debut album "Cake," itself only the stuff of modest 
expectations. Unlike the others, the Sinatras looked like a band whose music 
was created for and on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Lead singer Frank Read, a skinny kid who looks like he could be Michelle 
Shocked's younger brother, is a natural. It was hard to pick out many words 
through his burr, but with spontaneous-seeming movements and gestures he 
illustrated the emotions of the songs -- mostly tender, wistful and wondering 
-- creating drama without dramatics. He was communicating with the members of 
the audience, not just performing for them. 
</P>
<P>
Read's presence also helped give life to the music's textures. Some have 
compared the band to Aztec Camera, but it's more like the "shambling" 
Housemartins and Mighty Lemon Drops, folky pop that is at its best when played 
a little loose and with enough rough edges so that the inherent melodiousness 
never becomes sterile. 
</P>
<P>
The Sinatras did all that and took it even a step further with a 
controlled-chaos encore of the Beatles' "Tomorrow Never Knows." It's nothing 
earth-shaking, but it was a worthwhile evening of toe-tapping. STEVE HOCHMAN

NOVEMBER DEFICIT HITS $48 BILLION, 62% OVER YEAR AGO

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government ran up a $48.1-billion deficit in November, a 62% 
increase over a year ago, due in part to the Persian Gulf buildup and a failing 
economy, the Treasury Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with the October deficit, the imbalance for the first two months of 
fiscal 1991 totaled $79.5 billion, up 42.5% from the comparable period of 
fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said the 
weakening economy is resulting in declining tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really getting to the point where the deficit is starting to balloon 
because both personal and corporate taxes are starting to fall off," he said. 
"Receipts in November were $6 billion less than they should have been in a 
normal economy." 
</P>
<P>
The government collected $27.2 billion in individual income taxes last month, a 
21% decline from November, 1989. Corporate income taxes were down 46%, to $1.3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, defense spending increased 18% from a year ago, to $29 
billion.

A U.S. Navy launch carrying sailors on shore leave back to the aircraft carrier 
Saratoga capsized off the Israeli port of Haifa early today, killing one and 
injuring at least 27, Israeli army radio said. 
</P>
<P>
The radio said the Israeli navy was still conducting rescue operations. 
</P>
<P>
Between 70 to 100 people had been on the launch, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The launch was on its way to the Saratoga, which is part of the U.S. 6th Fleet, 
the radio said. The cause of the capsizing was not immediately known and 
details were sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy spokesman Don Cofman said the embassy had been informed of an 
incident involving a boat shuttling sailors back and forth from the port to 
ships anchored in Haifa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had no report of casualties and the matter was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
One dead person and 27 injured had been admitted to hospitals in Haifa, the 
radio said. Hospital officials reported that most of the injuries were minor, 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 6th Fleet makes regular stops at Haifa, Israel's main port in the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of American servicemen from the Saratoga and its escort ships 
disembarked at Haifa on Friday for Christmas leave. Some of those rescued were 
reported taken to the Saratoga.

FORECLOSURE FEAR PLUNGES USIU INTO CHAPTER 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fearing foreclosure of a portion of the campus, administrators at United States 
International University revealed Friday that they have filed for bankruptcy 
and plan an "economic reorganization" to avoid what one called the 
"destruction" of the school. 
</P>
<P>
University attorney David Osias said the school filed for protection under 
Chapter 11 after Mission Federal Credit Union threatened to foreclose on 70 
acres of the 200-acre Scripps Ranch campus Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Mission Federal) declined to give us a sufficient extension to allow the 
university time to pay off its debts, without jeopardizing its assets," Osias 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth McLennan, acting president of the university, who was appointed to his 
interim capacity in January, said Friday that the school will conduct a 
"thorough overview" of all phases of its operations. 
</P>
<P>
McLennan said the school will pay particular attention to its Division I 
athletic program and its acclaimed arts curricula, perhaps looking to those as 
the first to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
"To what degree can we carry those on in an austere economic climate?" McLennan 
said. "We'll have to look at changes." 
</P>
<P>
McLennan said no changes would take place until extensive meetings with faculty 
and student organizations, as well as board members, have taken place. But he 
left little doubt that extracurricular programs will be among the first 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
USIU officials say the school's debt is close to $14 million. An additional 
debt involving its London campus -- which is for sale -- is about $8.5 million. 
The school recently sold KUSI-TV (Channel 51), which produced about $10 
million. At the time of the sale, in February, McLennan said the debts were 
closer to $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Osias said the sale of the London campus should bring an estimated $60 million, 
which would lift the school out of its financial morass and place it on the 
positive side of the ledger. Its most prized asset is the $41-million campus on 
Pomerado Road in Scripps Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Hartley, senior vice president of Mission Federal Credit Union, said 
Friday that he was "stunned" that the school filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been lending to the university in one form or another since 1970," 
Hartley said. "We were even helping them with payroll loans, for goodness' 
sakes." 
</P>
<P>
Hartley said the school has been guilty of "broken promises and missed 
deadlines for years. We've heard it all. When their loans were due and payable, 
we heard every story and every excuse under the sun." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hartley said, the credit union remained committed to helping the 
school survive and "brought them to the table" for a Thursday meeting that he 
said produced a "shocking" revelation. 
</P>
<P>
"We met a new player, in the form of this professional bankruptcy lawyer (David 
Osias)," Hartley said. "The best way to explain my feelings on this is to give 
you an analogy: If my pet is dying, I take it to a veterinarian -- not a 
taxidermist." 
</P>
<P>
Hartley said bankruptcy affords the school "no guarantee of coming out intact. 
If you sense anger in my voice, I think it's because the risk they took was 
unnecessary. And we at the credit union have been emotionally involved in 
trying to help them make it. Now I'm not sure they will." 
</P>
<P>
Hartley said his concern was not based on the credit union losing its money. 
</P>
<P>
"We're secured 10 times beyond what they owe us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Osias said the credit union had given the school until April 9 to pay off about 
$7 million in accumulated debt, which he wasn't sure it could do. 
</P>
<P>
"If the amount wasn't paid by then, they were going to foreclose on the entire 
campus," he said. "This is what we were presented at 3:30 Thursday afternoon. 
Although we think we can pay off all those creditors, we're not certain we can 
do it by April 9. 
</P>
<P>
"And we didn't think it prudent to risk the entire campus. We asked them to 
give us time to think about it, at least until Wednesday morning (Dec. 26), but 
they declined to give us even that luxury. We had no choice left but to file 
for Chapter 11." 
</P>
<P>
McLennan said USIU has 1,800 students on its San Diego campus and 3,300 
worldwide. It operates campuses in Nairobi, Kenya, and Mexico City -- which it 
leases -- in addition to its London campus and a learning center in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
A recently proposed partnership with the Teikyo University Group of Japan, 
which Osias said would constitute "an economic reorganization of its own" and 
solve the school's financial problems, is in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
McLennan conceded that the school's financial problems -- in particular, 
suggested cuts in arts and sports programs -- will have a "dampening effect" on 
morale. He said the school maintains full academic scholarships for about 200 
students in arts and sports. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to continue our commitment to them as far as scholarships, so 
that they continue their academic activity," he said. "But I'm sure that the 
more gifted ones will want to go on to other schools so that they can 
participate in whatever their particular specialty is." 
</P>
<P>
One of the school's more gifted students is John Barrowman, who, as a junior 
spending a year at the London campus, auditioned and won a role in "Anything 
Goes," which led to a part in the hit play "Miss Saigon." 
</P>
<P>
Drew Tombrello, a professor of theater at the school, said Friday that he felt 
the reorganization of its finances was a welcome change and one that would 
enhance, rather than weaken, its arts program. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been assured that our programs will stay intact as long as we can show 
how the cost effectiveness will work," Tombrello said. "We spent too much 
money, and our program has a lot of fat. I'm glad to see all of that go." 
</P>
<P>
McLennan said the arts division spent too much on certain projects, an 
assessment with which Tombrello agreed. He said a production of "West Side 
Story" had cost more than $80,000, which he labeled "crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Tombrello blamed most of the school's problems on previous president William 
Rust, who governed for 37 years, and credited McLennan with doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
McLennan, a former four-star general in the Marine Corps, said Friday that the 
school essentially has no endowment and no mechanism for soliciting alumni 
contributions. He said the university makes its money primarily through the 
$15,000 room-and-board fees that students pay each year. 
</P>
<P>
Osias said the "destruction" of the university might have come about had the 
school not sought Chapter 11. Now, he said, he's most concerned with the 
message the faculty and students glean from the meaning of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
"If the wrong kind of message gets out, it will be self-defeating," he said. 
"It could seal the fate of the university and do so unfairly. Because we are 
not insolvent. I hope people realize that."

NEA PROBE TO CLEAR ARTISTS INVOLVED IN ANTI-SHOOTING ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four San Diego artists who used federal funds to pay for bus-bench ads that 
protested deadly force shootings by police soon will be exonerated as a result 
of an investigation by the National Endowment for the Arts, NEA sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA agreed to investigate the artists in early November, after a request 
from Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego), who said that it was "highly unusual and 
improper for artists to take NEA money and buy commercial advertising, 
regardless of its content." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Jack Lichtenstein, the national spokesman for the embattled 
federal arts agency, called the bus-bench ads "a most inappropriate use of NEA 
funds." But documents later obtained by The Times showed that the artists were 
operating within NEA guidelines and that, in fact, money for advertising space 
was specifically spelled out in their grant. 
</P>
<P>
And, on Thursday, a high-ranking official with the NEA, who asked not to be 
identified, said the agency's inspector general had concluded his report and 
found "no wrongdoing" on the part of the artists. He said the findings of the 
investigation might not be officially released until March. 
</P>
<P>
"The inspector general has turned over his findings to the general counsel," 
the source said. "The general counsel has determined that he'll wait for the 
final report from the art gallery that sponsored the artists," the Installation 
Gallery. "But essentially, they will be exonerated. After all, they did nothing 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Karl Higgins, a spokesman for Lowery, said Thursday from the congressman's San 
Diego office that he believed "the only reason" the artists would be exonerated 
was because they were operating under "old guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery is one of several conservative congressmen -- the most outspoken critic 
being North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms -- who called for a reappraisal of the 
NEA that led to new procedures for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that the new guidelines will prohibit artists from using 
taxpayer dollars for that kind of advertising," Higgins said. "If they want to 
create art and display it as part of their freedom of expression, fine. . . . 
But to use taxpayer dollars for commercial advertising to circulate such art 
was and is, in our view, inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"The new guidelines simply won't allow that, so, if they are exonerated -- and 
I'd prefer to comment more fully after the announcement is official -- they 
will be exonerated purely on a technicality . . . permissible only under old 
guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Small, one of the artists involved, said Thursday that neither she nor 
her colleagues will be surprised when the NEA clears them in a controversy that 
she said "didn't make much sense from the start." 
</P>
<P>
"We knew all along that it would be no problem for us," Small said, noting that 
the NEA grant, which functions as a contract, allotted the artists $4,000 for 
"media advertising." The ads cost $3,662.50. 
</P>
<P>
Given that the controversy arose just days before the November election, Small 
said she suspects that Lowery used it to enhance his bid for reelection against 
Democrat Dan Kripke, whom he defeated by 12,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"What Lowery was doing was helping himself get elected," Small said. "He used 
the issue as a smoke screen to mask what the work tried to address, which was 
police misconduct, the need for change, the need for a police review board with 
real power. . . . To complain about tax-dollar funding for political art was, I 
think, a red herring." 
</P>
<P>
Small said the ads, appearing on 25 bus benches throughout the city, showed up 
in late October and were removed Dec. 1. Many of the ads have been replaced by 
pro-police messages. 
</P>
<P>
"Season's Greetings to San Diego's Finest from the San Diego Crime Commission," 
reads one of the new ads, on a bus bench on Broadway, near the San Diego police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial art drawn by Small and fellow artists Elizabeth Sisco, Scott 
Kessler and Louis Hock featured the outline of seven human bodies silhouetted 
in black against a red background. Within each human figure was a target, 
similar to those at police shooting ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Within one target was a trowel, within another a baseball bat and within a 
third a garden stake. A pair of upraised hands and a question mark were drawn 
within others. 
</P>
<P>
Among those killed in shootings by police in 1990 were men wielding a baseball 
bat, a garden stake and a trowel. Another man was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
Small noted that, since the ads appeared, even since the controversy has died 
down, two other people have died in so-called deadly-force shootings. Both 
occurred in December; one man was unarmed, and the other, police said, pulled 
out a gun before being shot. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Police Department acknowledges that, since January, 27 people 
have been shot, 12 fatally, in what it labels deadly-force shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation won't change until the police change their practices," Small 
said. "Or, the City Council calls for greater accountability in the form of a 
review board with teeth. I have to laugh at Lowery's call for an NEA 
investigation. Think about the tax dollars that must have been spent on that, 
and for what? So that another Republican could get reelected?"

BALBOA PARK SHELTER REMAINS CLOSED DESPITE RAIN AND COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MONICA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the chill wind and rain have prompted the county and the St. Vincent 
de Paul Society to open their cold-weather homeless shelters, San Diego's 
municipal shelter remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Wolf, spokesman for the San Diego City Office of Emergency Management, 
said the city was not planning to open the Municipal Gymnasium in Balboa Park 
Friday night because temperatures had not dropped low enough. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Wolf said, temperatures must go as low as 35 degrees -- or 40 
degrees if there is at least 1 inch of rain in the forecast -- before the city 
will open its shelter. The county uses the same criteria, but nonetheless has 
opened its shelters because inland and mountain temperatures have gone that 
low. And the St. Vincent de Paul Society opens its cold-weather shelter 
whenever homeless people show up complaining about the cold, spokesmen there 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But the city was sticking by its criteria. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know what city this is?" said Harvey Mandel, assistant director of the 
St. Vincent de Paul shelter. "They're not going to open it. It's not cold 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur Shigehara of the National Weather Service office in San Diego said the 
low temperatures this week were in the mid-40s to low 50s. The low Friday was 
predicted to be 41 degrees, but tonight and Sunday they are expected to drop to 
the low 30s and upper 20s. 
</P>
<P>
"Temperatures in downtown San Diego will approach near record," he said. 
"Sunday morning will be close to 38 degrees." 
</P>
<P>
He also said the coldest Dec. 23 was in 1891, when the temperatures dropped to 
37 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Although San Diego County uses the same temperature guidelines as the city, its 
shelters have been open for several days, county spokesman Bob Lerner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Before 10 a.m., the county Office of Disaster Preparedness checks (with the 
National Weather Service) for a predicted low," Lerner said. Based on what the 
Weather Service says, the county decides whether to open the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Lerner said that, in order to open the Vista shelters, the county uses a 
temperature reading for Escondido, "because if we use the Vista or Oceanside 
temperature, then we would never be able to open because the temperatures don't 
drop that far (closer to the ocean)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county has opened its shelters in the Army National Guard Armory in El 
Cajon and has also opened the North County Regional Center in Vista until 
Sunday. The armory in Vista will be used starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month the Regional Center, which houses two courtrooms and several 
county administrative offices, was the focus of controversy when Superior Court 
Judge Kevin Midlam ordered that the facility could not be used as a cold 
weather shelter because the safety of evidence and documents was at stake. 
Midlam reversed his order the next day after county officials assured him that 
security would be provided -- and after county counsel ruled that the county, 
not the judge, controls access to the county building. 
</P>
<P>
Lerner said that, because of the forecast low temperatures and the holidays, 
the county would keep the shelters open through Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
Shelters in the city, including the St. Vincent de Paul Joan Kroc Center, said 
they had noticed an increase in the number of people going there. 
</P>
<P>
Father Joe Carroll said the center was expecting to receive as many as 630 
people Friday night and said that, by Saturday, the center could reach its 
limit and might have to turn people away. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Molina, a social service administrator with the Salvation Army, said its 
shelter was also filled to capacity because of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
"It is always filled around the holiday time and whenever the temperature drops 
we get more people," Molina said. 
</P>
<P>
Molina said that, if people had to be turned away, his organization would try 
to find other shelter for them. 
</P>
<P>
Orange and Los Angeles counties, which use different minimum temperatures to 
determine when to open, have also opened their shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Wilkins, Los Angeles countywide homeless coordinator, said a county 
program to provide shelter has been in effect since November 1 and will 
continue until March 31. 
</P>
<P>
He said the county is divided into four regions that have a total of 12 
shelters. If the National Weather Service predicts that temperatures will drop 
below 40 degrees or below 50 degrees with a 50% chance of rain in any of the 
areas where there is a shelter, then all of the shelters in the region are 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
The same guidelines are used to open shelters in Orange County, said Valerie 
Griffin, program manager for the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force.

OUSTED LEADER ASSAILS ALLIANCE BETWEEN SIERRA CLUB, BERNHARDT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego City Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt's anti-recall forces sought to 
"circumvent" campaign laws by funneling contributions from an ambulance company 
to the Sierra Club to pay for pro-Bernhardt campaign mailers, an ousted Sierra 
Club leader charged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Zerbe, who was pressured to resign from the Sierra Club's top leadership 
panel Thursday night, issued the charge Friday in a blistering nine-page memo 
that contended that the preservationist organization has abandoned its 
environmental principles to support Bernhardt at all costs. None of Zerbe's 
many accusations could be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Club's staunch support for Linda in the face of certain defeat (in an 
expected recall election this spring) is embarrassing and may result in the 
loss of an environmental majority on the City Council," Zerbe wrote in the Dec. 
13 memo to Sierra Club officials that he distributed publicly Friday. "The Club 
now smells as bad as the dead horse it chained itself to." 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Club Chairman Rob Langsdorf declined to discuss any of Zerbe's 
allegations, which included its relationship with Bernhardt, manipulation of 
elected Sierra Club leaders by the organization's political lobbyists and the 
environmental report card the club released Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt, however, called Zerbe's charges "baseless allegations" made by a 
political opponent. "The guy apparently has some serious problems," Bernhardt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Roberts, chief executive officer of Hartson Medical Services, denied 
Zerbe's accusation that a contribution to Bernhardt's campaign was linked to a 
council vote on the Hartson contract with the city. Roberts said he has 
contributed funds to every City Council member except Abbe Wolfsheimer, but did 
not recall when he last contributed to Bernhardt. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted, 6 to 2, Sept. 18 to negotiate an extended contract with 
Hartson and added 10 firefighters to the paramedic force. Bernhardt voted with 
the majority. 
</P>
<P>
Zerbe, then treasurer of the Sierra Club's political committee, claimed that, 
when he balked at accepting the money, he received a call from David Gould, 
Bernhardt's campaign treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gould called me the next day and suggested ways of circumventing the 
city's $250 contribution limit and ban on contributions from businesses, such 
as getting a stack of contributions from employees of Hartson's and depositing 
them in the Sierra Club's account in San Francisco so that it wouldn't appear 
in campaign records in San Diego," Zerbe wrote in the memo. 
</P>
<P>
Gould did not return a telephone call to his office Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The scheme was never carried out, Zerbe said. But, in the memo, he added that 
"lobbyists seldom give contributions just prior to important votes without 
making sure the politicians involved are aware of them. I also find it 
difficult to believe that the Bernhardt campaign would casually expect me to 
allow the (Sierra Club political committee) account to be used to launder 
contributions without someone within the Club first making the suggestions to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Zerbe, who worked to defeat former Councilman Ed Struiksma, Bernhardt's 1989 
political opponent, acknowledged Friday that he no longer supports the 5th 
District councilwoman. Last month, he publicly accused the Sierra Club of 
manipulating its environmental report card so that Bernhardt would be ranked 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Those accusations led to his ouster at a Sierra Club meeting Thursday night. 
Langsdorf declined to discuss the situation, issuing a three-paragraph 
statement that said, in part, that "Mark made it clear that he did not wish to 
use the (club's) process to deal with his concerns." 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's memo, Zerbe went further, claiming that the Sierra Club's second 
report card was published as an "alternate method" of supporting Bernhardt, 
when the organization's executive committee balked at sending out a favorable 
mailer to its membership. 
</P>
<P>
"It was discussed that (the report card) would have to be prepared quickly in 
order to have an impact on the recall," Zerbe wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Zerbe also said in the memo that Julie Dillon, chairman of the local Building 
Industry Assn., told him in a meeting that "Bernhardt had effectively been 
extorting money from developers, and that they were considering a financial 
boycott." 
</P>
<P>
Dillon said the charge was "totally false" and that she discussed only water 
conservation and campaign reform with Zerbe.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
NEW BOOK DETAILS HISTORY OF THE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the Lone Ranger heartily exclaimed "Hi-Yo Silver," it was away into the 
Simi Valley Hills that he galloped. 
</P>
<P>
When Roy Rogers and Dale Evans sang "Happy Trails to You," it was in the Santa 
Susana Mountains that they clip-clopped along. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the tidbits that Simi Valley resident and free-lance writer 
Linda Aleahmad has included in her recently published book, "Simi Valley: 
Toward New Horizons. An Illustrated History." 
</P>
<P>
The book documents Simi Valley's rise from a small farming community to a 
modern business center, one that next year will see the opening of the Ronald 
Reagan Presidential Library. 
</P>
<P>
"Simi Valley has a very special quality all its own," said Aleahmad, who spent 
the past 18 months researching and writing the book. 
</P>
<P>
"There are over 100,000 people here, but it still has a small town feel to it." 
</P>
<P>
Several pages in Aleahmad's book are devoted to Simi Valley's rich movie-making 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1937, the rock-studded hills at the east end of the city have served as a 
backdrop for thousands of shoot-'em-up Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
The book makes particular mention of the movie ranch once owned by the late 
Hollywood stuntman Ray "Crash" Corrigan. Although the ranch, known as 
Corriganville, was destroyed in a fire in 1965, efforts are now under way to 
rebuild it. 
</P>
<P>
Aleahmad, a member of the Simi Valley Historical Society who has lived in Simi 
Valley for 20 years, said she does not consider her book to be a strict 
historical account of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I would call it a history book," she said. "It's more of an 
overview of the development of the valley." 
</P>
<P>
The book, which will be distributed nationwide, was published by 
Chatsworth-based Windsor Publications Inc. in cooperation with the Simi Valley 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Bender, executive director of the chamber, said the book was her idea and 
that she had suggested that Aleahmad write it. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, one chapter in the book is devoted to Simi Valley's business 
community and titled, "Partners in Progress." 
</P>
<P>
The businesses that are mentioned helped pay for the book's publication. 
</P>
<P>
Bender said she is happy with the way the book turned out. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the opening of the Reagan Library late next year will mean that 
people will want to know more about Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful product to market our community," she said. CARLOS V. LOZANO

TEACHERS' PAY RAISE GETS TENTATIVE OK

Conejo Valley teachers would receive a 20% raise over the next three years 
under a tentative agreement reached Friday, union and school district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between representatives of the United Assn. of Conejo Teachers and 
the Conejo Valley Unified School District wrapped up Thursday night, followed 
by a closed session discussion by school board members. 
</P>
<P>
The union's executive board, representing 712 teachers, unanimously approved 
the tentative agreement Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The school board is scheduled to consider the proposed contract at its Jan. 10 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Union members will vote on it Jan. 23. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new contract calls for a 7% raise in the 1990-91 and 1991-92 
school years and a 6% raise for the 1992-93 school year, which union officials 
say will bring teachers' salaries in line with those of neighboring school 
districts. The union was seeking a combined 22% raise over the three years. 
</P>
<P>
"It was close enough that I feel we met our goals," said Hal Vick, executive 
director of the union. "This does a lot to make up for past sins of the 
district." 
</P>
<P>
Class size will be reduced from a maximum 37 students to 36 students for grades 
four through six. The size of secondary physical education classes also may be 
reduced due to a new class-size formula. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers will receive a small lottery bonus in early 1991, but will no longer 
get a portion of the district's lottery funds. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers got an excellent contract," Assistant Supt. Leean Nemeroff said. 
"The district addressed as many issues as we could." STEPHANIE STASSEL

POLICE SHOOT GUNMAN WITH RUBBER BULLET; 
</P>
<P>
CONFRONTATION: STANDOFF WITH SWAT OFFICERS ENDS WHEN NON-LETHAL WEAPON IS USED 
TO STUN DISTRAUGHT MAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A four-hour standoff between San Diego police and a gunman entrenched in his 
former girlfriend's Mira Mesa home ended Friday when a SWAT officer shot the 
gunman with a rubber bullet, bringing him to his knees but not seriously 
injuring him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill McHugh, 20, was taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital, where he was treated 
for a wound to his left ear, and released into police custody, said hospital 
spokeswoman Edie High. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department has been under intense criticism this year for shooting 
to death 12 people, a new record. McHugh was the first suspect to be shot by 
police with a rubber bullet. 
</P>
<P>
Police received a call saying a gunman had broken into a home in the 8000 block 
of Chalet Place and threatened to kill everyone inside, said Lt. Mike Blakely, 
a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The four residents, including McHugh's former girlfriend and her husband of one 
month, ran out of the house before police arrived, Blakely said. 
</P>
<P>
McHugh, who ignored a police command to leave the house and surrender, kept 
SWAT officers at bay with a .22-caliber rifle. 
</P>
<P>
By using rubber bullets, SWAT officers "managed to take into custody a man who 
was literally asking for us to kill him," Police Chief Bob Burgreen said during 
a press conference Friday, in which he outlined a plan to reduce the number of 
people shot and killed by officers. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, McHugh knocked on the door of the house shortly after 
2:45 a.m. and identified himself as a policeman, Blakely said. 
</P>
<P>
John Ingram, who was watching television, refused to open the door, but McHugh 
crashed through the living-room window, Blakely said. 
</P>
<P>
McHugh stormed through the house searching for his former girlfriend, Amanda 
Baker, threatening to kill anyone in his way, Blakely said. He also put the 
barrel of his rifle in his mouth and threatened to kill himself. Amanda Baker's 
husband, Ron Baker, and his brother, Rick, also were in the house. 
</P>
<P>
Amanda Baker was able to call police before McHugh confronted her. She dropped 
the phone, but Ingram, who also lives at the house, picked up an extension and 
was able to complete the call. 
</P>
<P>
All four were able to escape from the gunman, who refused to surrender to 
police and demanded to speak to Baker, Blakely said. SWAT officers were 
summoned to the home, and members from the emergency negotiating team arrived 
and talked to McHugh for several hours through an open door. 
</P>
<P>
McHugh threatened to start shooting if denied the opportunity of speaking with 
Baker, and, in fact, fired one shot about 5 a.m., Blakely said. 
</P>
<P>
McHugh paced between the kitchen and the living room, sometimes sitting in a 
living-room chair and propping his rifle against the wall, Blakely said. 
</P>
<P>
During one of these moments, shortly after 6:30 a.m., a SWAT officer shot 
McHugh with a rubber bullet striking him in the face next to his left ear, 
Blakely said. The officer fired the bullet from a 12-gauge shotgun while 
standing about 20 feet away. McHugh fell out of the chair with his head in his 
hands and SWAT officers rushed in. 
</P>
<P>
"After he was bandaged, he walked out with the paramedic and sat on the 
gurney," he said, adding that McHugh never lost consciousness. "He had a nice 
broad smile on his face while he was out on the street. After a four-hour 
siege, I thought it was peculiar." 
</P>
<P>
Rubber bullets have been used by the SWAT team for several years on an 
experimental basis, but have never been used in a real situation, Blakely said. 
The bullets are designed to flatten on impact and stun the victim, rather than 
penetrate the victim's body. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation today was a scenario that presented itself where that particular 
weapon was the best thing to use with the least amount of force and least 
amount of loss of life." 
</P>
<P>
Other officers will be receiving training on using rubber bullets as part of 
the plan outlined by Burgreen. 
</P>
<P>
McHugh, "under normal conditions, would have been shot and killed in all 
probability by a police officer," Burgreen said. "That man went to a hospital, 
got 10 stitches in his head, had a devil of a headache for a while, and is now 
in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"We would hope in a few instances every year, we can pull off a similar 
operation without having to kill someone with the use of this type of weapon."

STUDENTS GET 120 DAYS IN ATTACK ON LEGAL IMMIGRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two North County men were sentenced Friday to 120 days in a private 
work-furlough center for robbing a migrant worker in an incident that had 
racial overtones. 
</P>
<P>
Both Albert Francis Martell, 20, from Rancho Penasquitos, and Michael James 
Felsinger, 18, of Rancho Bernardo, were placed on three years' probation by San 
Diego Municipal Judge Frank Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Because both defendants are in college and didn't want any time in custody to 
be served during the school year, Brown ordered the men to serve 60 days next 
summer and the other two months in the summer of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
They will be able to drive to work during the daytime, but must report into 
their private custodial setting at nights and on weekends while the sentence is 
being served. 
</P>
<P>
They already have repaid $1,900 to the victim, Luis Calderon, whose 1980 Datsun 
station wagon was heavily vandalized. Calderon was robbed of his wallet and his 
green card. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred at 2 a.m. June 9 on Black Mountain Road in Rancho 
Penasquitos. The pair originally were booked on a hate-crime charge because 
they allegedly made racial remarks during the holdup. 
</P>
<P>
A prosecutor said the defendants initially told Calderon, a legal immigrant, 
that they were Border Patrol agents and demanded to see his immigration card. 
They took the card after he produced it, and it was later found near his car,

Deputy Dist. Atty. John Oliphant had sought a 180-day sentence for Felsinger 
and a 90- to 120-day sentence for Martell. Oliphant said Felsinger was believed 
to be more culpable than Martell.

Neither man had a criminal record. They pleaded guilty to robbery Oct. 15.

LITTLE LEAGUE WINS 1 LAST SEASON ON FIELD 
</P>

<P>
Little League teams may hold games in a neighborhood park for one more season, 
the Port Hueneme City Council decided, but three palm trees located 100 feet 
from home plate will have to be moved. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's council decision came after a two-year battle between Port Hueneme 
Little League advocates and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members, a consultant and a recreation committee wanted the younger 
T-ball teams to move from Bubbling Springs Park to Moranda Park. 
</P>
<P>
Never intended as a permanent home for the younger players, the field causes 
parking problems for neighbors, Brady Cherry, the city's parks and recreation 
director, said. The consultant advised the city that the field with the palm 
trees would be better suited for picnickers. 
</P>
<P>
Little League leaders, however, didn't want to split operations between two 
parks. Playing at Moranda Park would create safety hazards for children 
crossing major roads and cut revenues at the league-run snack bar at Bubbling 
Springs, they said. About 50% of the league's $55,000 budget comes from snack 
bar proceeds, league officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision will allow about 100 to 120 6- and 7-year-olds to play in the 
league's T-ball division from March to June. League officials had decided to 
cut participation rather than move some of the teams to another park, league 
president Joe Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
The league will pay to remove three 60-foot palm trees, which are considered 
safety hazards. During games, parents are posted to keep youngsters from 
running into the trees as they chase balls. The trees were planted 20 years 
ago, Cherry said. DONNA DOWLING

PLANNERS REBUFF BUILDER'S PARK OFFER 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ojai planners rebuffed the offer of a city park from a developer Wednesday 
despite threats that his 31-acre meadow might be fenced to keep out 
schoolchildren, equestrians and bird-watchers. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners spoke 5 to 1 against developer Howard M. Palmer's offer 
to donate 11 acres of his meadow for a public park near Nordhoff High School. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said the park's benefits could offset environmental impacts of his 
proposed 26-lot subdivision on the remaining 20 acres. 
</P>
<P>
"A project of this size just doesn't fly in Ojai anymore," Commission Chairman 
Lynn McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer paid a $50 hearing fee to test the commission's views before submitting 
the plan. He asked the City Council for a similar review on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 residents attended the hearing to oppose the subdivision. Several 
urged Palmer to donate the entire parcel to a nature conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Finlinson of Salt Lake City, Palmer's loan consultant with the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp., said he was puzzled by the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is forgetting that somebody is making mortgage payments on that 
land," he said. Palmer said he has been stalling foreclosure on the land for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seized the assets of Palmer's lender, 
Mountain West Savings and Loan, two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
If the subdivision is not approved, Finlinson said the government will call in 
Palmer's loan, put up a big, chain-link fence and no-trespassing signs and sell 
the land to another developer. THIA BELL

<P>
Santa Paula Union High School has received a $5,000 state matching grant to 
offer help to students who cut class. 
</P>
<P>
The money, awarded under the Safe Schools program, allowed the district to hire 
a full-time teacher to run a study hall where students can receive individual 
help with study skills and other problems, Dax Bryson, assistant principal, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The school psychologist, county resource specialists, community members, 
parents and police officers will work one-on-one with students who are at risk 
of dropping out of school, Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers, who are part of the Safe Schools program, round up truant 
students and return them to the study hall. The district plans in February to 
change a policy that allows students to leave campus at lunch and breaks, 
Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will help a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The school was one of 100 statewide to receive the funds out of 260 that 
applied, Rich Morrison of the county superintendent of schools office, said. 
The school also will contribute $5,000 from its general fund. AMELIA CHAFFEE

CITY TO JOIN STUDY ON PIPELINE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMELIA CHAFFEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Paula City Council has approved spending $31,500 to participate in a 
joint environmental study of a proposed pipeline that would import Northern 
California water to portions of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The study, which will take nearly a year to complete, is being conducted by 
area cities considering tapping into the state water system for relief from the 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
The council acted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The pipeline would bring water to Santa Paula on its way to Ventura and would 
improve both the quantity and quality of water now available, said Norm 
Wilkinson, city public works director. Importing state water would slow the 
depletion of ground-water reserves, which are already 30 feet below normal 
levels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Imported water could also be mixed with the ground water to improve its 
quality, officials said. Ground water in the area has a high concentration of 
sulfates. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula's share of the annual operating costs of such a pipeline would be 
$1 million to $2 million, water authorities said. That would include the 
capital costs of the pipeline, water treatment facilities and cost of the water 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Barringer, a former City Council member, said the city probably would fund 
the project with a bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick J. Gientke, United Water Conservation District general manager, said 
it would take from five to 10 years before the pipeline could actually be built 
because of needed environmental reviews and government approvals. 
</P>
<P>
The study will examine where the pipeline would begin and whether the water 
would be treated at its source or the destination, Wilkinson said. It will also 
examine other sources of water supply, from icebergs to reclamation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to stay involved in the process," Wilkinson said. "Once we get some 
questions answered, we will have a better picture of what the project can and 
will do. Then we can decide whether or not to participate," Wilkinson said.

MOTIVES NOT ALL SO HIGH-MINDED; 
</P>
<P>
U.N. VOTE IS MONUMENT TO SELECTIVE INDIGNATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The passage of a U. N. Security Council resolution criticizing Israel's recent 
deportation of four Palestinians and demanding that it abide by the provisions 
of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the territories it occupies ought to be a 
sobering event not only for Israel, but also for the United States, which 
supported the censure. 
</P>
<P>
Calling a friend to account for insupportable conduct never is a pleasant 
experience, particularly when doing so puts one in dubious company. And no 
mistake should be made: That is precisely where the United States stands in the 
wake of this resolution, the third vote hostile to Israel taken by the Security 
Council since the onset of the gulf crisis. All three resolutions have been 
initiated by the Palestine Liberation Organization, which would be satisfied 
either to provoke the United States into a veto that might shatter the 
anti-Saddam coalition or to drive a wedge between Washington and its ally, 
Israel. Those also are the shabby objectives of the majority of these 
resolutions' supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever one may say concerning Israel's conduct in the occupied territories, 
the U.N.'s interest in it borders on the obsessive, particularly when one 
considers the catalogue of human-rights violations with which the U.N. does not 
concern itself. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, Amnesty International's most recent report on conditions in 
the four nations -- Cuba, Colombia, Yemen and Malaysia -- which sponsored this 
resolution: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Cuba: "At least 60 government critics, many of them prisoners of 
conscience, were arrested . . . . The majority were sentenced to prison terms 
after trials which fell short of international standards of fairness . . . . At 
least four prisoners were sentenced to death and executed in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Colombia: "Many hundreds of people, including judicial officials 
investigating human-rights violations, were extrajudicially executed. Scores of 
other people 'disappeared' after detention." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Yemen: "At least 31 suspected opponents of the government were arrested 
and held without charge, including possible prisoners of conscience . . . . The 
fate of 16 detainees who 'disappeared' in previous years remained unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Malaysia: "Allegations of ill treatment in detention continued, and the 
national press reported that four people died in police custody. At least 71 
death sentences were imposed . . . seven for possession of firearms." 
</P>
<P>
Israel has no death penalty except for Nazi war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
But the continued expression of the U.N.'s hypocrisy is abetted by Israel's 
insistence that it can exercise sovereign authority over the people and 
territories it occupied while defending itself in 1967. Treatment of their 
inhabitants must be governed not by Israeli legality, but by the Geneva 
Convention. It forbids the collective punishments and deportations Israel 
continues to employ against the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
That is one problem; the U.N.'s anti-Israeli obsession is another. Both call to 
mind the Latin aphorism, Pax Opus Justitiae. Peace is the work of justice.

VITAL LEGACY OF NANCY CRUZAN; 
</P>
<P>
ISSUE IS NOT SO MUCH THE RIGHT TO DIE BUT THE RIGHT TO LIVE AS ONE SEES FIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ambivalent U.S. Supreme Court ruling wound up giving a lower court the room 
it needed recently to halt the forced feedings of Nancy Cruzan. Without the 
feeding tubes in place to maintain her state of permanent unconsciousness, the 
33-year-old Missouri woman will die soon. While it will be a merciful end, the 
thought of it is no cause for cheer. But it is cause to appreciate what Nancy 
and parents Joe and Joyce Cruzan have given to others in the nearly eight years 
since Nancy left life as she valued it. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Cruzan was involved a serious car accident in 1983. Since then she has 
been able to breathe on her own but has no awareness of herself or her 
surroundings. She is in what doctors call a "persistent vegetative state." Her 
parents fought -- against strict Missouri state laws and a tenacious attorney 
general's office -- to make the decision that their daughter would have made. 
Nancy Cruzan had told friends that she would not want to be fed by force or 
kept alive by machines. 
</P>
<P>
The Cruzans' cause attracted much attention to the "right-to-die"; but the 
larger importance of the Cruzan case is not the right to die, but the right to 
live as one sees fit. It is about understanding medical options and the 
consequences of accepting or refusing treatment. 
</P>
<P>
One national law that resulted from the Cruzan case takes effect late next 
year. It will require most hospitals and other health-care facilities to inform 
patients of their medical-care rights if they become incapacitated. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the legal effect of the Cruzan case has been minimal because 
state law and a state constitutional guarantee of privacy make it easier for 
next of kin or a designate to act in what is considered the best interests of 
an incapacitated person. But the publicity surrounding the Cruzan case has been 
an effective prod in persuading many people to make legal arrangements; the 
publicity also no doubt sparked many informal conversations about the case. 
Such conversations could be cited later as evidence of a person's wishes 
regarding prolonged or extraordinary medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Nancy Cruzan's legacy is the better chance that other tragedies such as 
hers can be averted.

MEXICAN COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the nicest developments for the fre-trade future agreements between 
Mexicoand the U.S. is the strong interest that the Mexican government is now 
showing in the 15-million-strong Mexican-American community, particularly for 
investment and expertise. 
</P>
<P>
Already it has established a "Program for Mexican Community Abroad" that is run 
from a special office in the Interior Ministry in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
A high government official has admitted that they have finally become aware of 
the growing political and economic importanceof the Mexican-American community. 
They want this community to "lobby for us in U.S. society much like the smaller 
U.S. Jewish population has championed successfully Israel's cause." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly our great state would benefit from all this since we have about half 
of all Mexican-Americans in America. Even a modest $10,000 investment in Mexico 
can bring hefty profits. With increasing success south of the border, the 
Mexicans will have more moneyto buy from us, particularly from our state.

AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Very little remains of Eastern Europe's once-thriving and deeply rooted Jewish 
communities. The Holocaust and subsequent emigration of most of the survivors 
of that unspeakable crime have left remnant Jewish populations of only a few 
thousand in countries where before World War II hundreds of thousands or even 
millions had flourished. But the near-disappearance of Jewish life has not 
produced the disappearance of anti-Semitism. In Romania and Hungary and most 
especially in Poland, the ancient bigotry has resurfaced. Jean-Paul Sartre's 
observation that if the Jew didn't exist the anti-Semite would invent him is 
again being validated. 
</P>
<P>
The reappearance of anti-Semitism in post-Communist Eastern Europe prompted an 
international conference in Prague three months ago between Roman Catholic and 
Jewish representatives. From it emerged a strong statement condemning 
anti-Semitism as "a sin against God and humanity." In his endorsement, which in 
part restated the declaration of the Second Vatican Council, Pope John Paul II 
acknowledged that some aspects of Catholic teaching had in fact fostered 
anti-Semitism, and called for strong efforts to combat its revival in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's Roman Catholic bishops have now produced a document, to be read in all 
of that country's churches on Jan. 20, that both condemns anti-Semitism and 
expresses regret over the cooperation by some Poles with Nazi mass murders of 
Jews a half-century ago. Those activities, the bishops wrote, "forever gnaw at 
our conscience." Acknowledgement of the role taken by some Poles in the 
Holocaust comes late, but may still help as a moral deterrent to the new 
anti-Semitism in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Lech Walesa, who is to be sworn in today as that country's president, himself 
made comments during his campaign widely inferred to be anti-Jewish. Some of 
his followers left no doubts about their own anti-Jewish sentiments. This in a 
country where only about 6,000 Jews survive out of a prewar population of 3 
million. The old prejudices seem far from extinct in the new Poland. The Polish 
bishops' message that anti-Semitism is against the spirit of the gospel is one 
that can't be restated too often.

EX-SOCKER KARIC SCORES SIX GOALS IN CRUNCH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK McDERMOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
RICHFIELD, Ohio 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call him a six-shooter. 
</P>
<P>
And Friday, former Sockers forward Zoran Karic used his former teammates for 
target practice. 
</P>
<P>
Karic scored six goals and one assist to lead the Cleveland Crunch to an 11-6 
Major Soccer League victory against the Sockers in front of 3,248 at the 
Richfield Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
He became the first player to score six goals in a MSL game since the Sockers' 
Branko Segota accomplished the feat Dec. 4, 1987 against the now-defunct 
Cleveland Force. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never scored more than a hat trick in the MSL before tonight," said 
Karic, who was traded March 7 to Cleveland for forward Paul Wright, "and the 
fact it comes against my former team makes it extra special for me." 
</P>
<P>
Karic's double hat trick snapped a five-game losing streak for the Crunch. For 
the Sockers (9-10), a four-game winning streak was snapped. 
</P>
<P>
He had two goals in the final 15 minutes of play to put the game out of reach 
for the Crunch, who entered the fourth quarter with a 6-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It took an unbelievable effort on Zoran's part to put this one away," Crunch 
Coach Kai Haaskivi said. "I thought he was never going to get tired scoring, 
but we needed every one of them, as close as things were to that point." 
</P>
<P>
Karic could have scored a seventh goal in the final 47 seconds of play, but 
elected to pass off to teammate Hector Marinaro for an open-net goal against. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think I'm a selfish player," Karic said. "But, I've never thought 
of myself in those terms. Hector stole the ball and passed it to me and I had 
an open net, but I passed it back to Hector. He stole the ball, the goal was 
too easy and I felt it should be his since he had made the steal." 
</P>
<P>
Sockers Coach Ron Newman was dismayed by his team's defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to take anything away from Zoran, but I didn't see a goal out 
there tonight that any of them (Cleveland) deserved," Newman said. "Tonight was 
just a nightmare of errors for our defense, and somehow we were still in the 
game until the end." 
</P>
<P>
Waad Hirmez scored on a rebound of his own shot to give the Sockers a 1-0 lead, 
but Karic took a header from teammate Michael King 45 seconds later and scored 
to tie the game with 2:14 gone. 
</P>
<P>
Crunch midfielder Andy Schmetzer put Cleveland on top, 2-1, and King got his 
15th goal of the season at the 12:17 mark, from 30 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers answered with goals by Sockers midfielder Brian Quinn and Michael 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
The third quarter belonged to Karic. He scored 38 seconds into the period and 
again at 7:21 to give the Crunch a 5-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The two goals gave him his first hat trick of the season. The first goal came 
on a 12-footer from the left of the Crunch goal off a pass from Schmetzer. The 
second came on a left-foot shot from 25 feet away, with Marinaro getting the 
assist. 
</P>
<P>
Socker forward Paul Wright then cut the Crunch lead to 5-4 with his 14th goal 
of the season, but Karic responded with his fourth goal of the game 1:02 later. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez then scored his second goal of the night, taking a restart pass from 
Segota and slamming it past Cleveland goalie Otto Orf from 15 feet out. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers' fourth-quarter goal came only 1:53 into the period, with Segota 
scoring unassisted to cut the Crunch lead to 7-6.

MORNING BRIEFING: WOLVERINE FANS DO THE WAVE THE RIGHT WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You get an A for the day in Useless Information 101 if you know that when 
students at the University of Washington gave the world The Wave in the 1970s, 
the original version went from the bottom row of Husky Stadium to the top, not 
sideways. 
</P>
<P>
At Michigan Stadium, they've been doing it the original way for years. 
Spectators in the lower rows stand up to see the action, creating a domino 
effect -- the "Hey, down in front" wave. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the University of Michigan board of regents threw $1 million in 
athletic department funds at the problem, voting to lower the stadium's field 3 
1/2 feet as part of the project that will convert the surface from artificial 
to natural turf. 
</P>
<P>
Add lower field: The regents' move did not please interim athletic director 
Jack Weidenbach, who said: "I don't take that lightly. It's our athletic 
department funds. A million here, a million there -- it adds up." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Name the only National Football League team coached by a Kohawk. 
</P>
<P>
That championship season: For Laker fans who thought their team's 74 points 
against the Cleveland Cavaliers Wednesday night was its lowest output since 
moving from Minneapolis to Los Angeles in 1960, reader Arthur Steiner has good 
news: It was only the Los Angeles Lakers' lowest regular-season point total. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game of the Western Conference finals on April 9, 1972, the Lakers 
lost to Milwaukee, 93-72. 
</P>
<P>
Return requested: Two and a half years ago, Chris Mills, the former Fairfax 
High forward who had committed to the University of Kentucky, became entangled 
in a recruiting scandal when $1,000 in cash fell out of an air-freight package 
containing a videotape on its way from the university to Mills' father. 
</P>
<P>
Mills eventually transferred to Arizona, and led the Wildcats to a victory over 
Arkansas in the final game of the preseason National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Journal and Constitution saluted him with the headline: "Mills 
carries the mail for Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
Bubby-buddy: Shari Warren, a reporter for KSLA-TV in Shreveport, La., had just 
finished interviewing Pittsburgh quarterback Bubby Brister in the locker room 
after the Steelers' 9-6 victory over New Orleans Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Another reporter was asking Brister a question when Warren said, "Bye," kissed 
him and left. 
</P>
<P>
Objective reporting? 
</P>
<P>
Warren said she has known Brister since he was in high school and added: "We 
were teasing around. That's what we've always done. I hugged him like I would 
any old friend." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Buffalo Bills, whose coach, Marv Levy, was a running back in 
1948-50 for the Coe College Kohawks and returned to coach them in 1953-55. 
Sightings of the Kohawk in the wild are rare, but cartoon renderings clearly 
place the bird in the genetic lineage of Sam the Eagle, official mascot of the 
1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: David Meggett, the New York Giants' second-year running back, on not 
being voted onto the NFC Pro Bowl team after having made it as a rookie in 
1989: "Yeah, I'm disappointed. No Mai Tais for me this year." TED BROCK

NCAA POLICIES NEED MAJOR RECONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the collegiate football season nears an end, it can be hoped that the NCAA 
will now review its policies regarding sanctions against schools in violation 
of NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
In light of many of the NCAA's actions, one must wonder at the organization's 
integrity. Certainly its intelligence is brought into question. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago the NCAA handed Southern Methodist University's football 
program the "death penalty." Not only was SMU, a member of the Southwest 
Conference, stripped of all its athletic scholarships and its eligibility to 
appear on TV or in postseason bowl games, it was banned from fielding a 
football team for a couple of seasons. This was a punishment from which the 
university has not yet recovered. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the harsh sanctions against SMU, the entire Southwest Conference 
has suffered. Houston, Florida and Oklahoma are the other schools whose 
football teams labored this year under bans denying them eligibility for 
postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Who is really punished by such bans as those administered by the NCAA? When you 
consider that Houston, Florida and Oklahoma all finished among the top 20 teams 
in the nation, it seems that not only were those schools and their alumni 
penalized, but so were football fans everywhere. We will not have the 
opportunity to see any of these schools in any bowl game -- because of 
infractions committed by players and coaches no longer connected with the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The legal system of our country does not condemn an entire community because of 
the presence of a few criminals. Nor should the NCAA penalize an entire school, 
an athletic program, or an entire team because of the presence of a few 
violators of the rules. Sanctions should be enforced only against guilty 
individuals . . . players and coaches. Sanctions should be strong enough to 
remove those found guilty of infractions but should not be of such a nature as 
to destroy any phase of a school's program. 
</P>
<P>
There is big money in collegiate sports, and the revenue received from athletic 
programs support many academic, non-athletic programs. To deprive any 
institution of the maximum income its athletic program can generate is unfair 
in that it works hardship on countless students not involved in athletics. It 
is time for the NCAA to stop punishing schools and programs and to impose its 
bans only on individual wrongdoers.

A longtime sports fan has been lost to the greed of sponsors, management and 
"athletes."

I worked my Norwegian butt off for 35 years and made about $600,000 in that

six months of questionable labor.

The only way I can express my disgust with this stupidity is to not buy any

THE BIG GAME;

<P>
BARONS BREAK 100-POINT MARK IN WIN 
</P>

CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It used to be a whole lot easier to keep score of a high school boys' 
basketball game. But nowadays, with the three-point shot and high school kids 
watching on TV as teams such as Loyola Marymount, Oklahoma and Arkansas run up 
scores like a bad round of golf . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bonita Vista defeated Chula Vista, 102-80, in a Metro Conference game Friday at 
Bonita Vista. Or was it 100-81? Or 100-82? 
</P>
<P>
A discrepancy in at least three books being kept at courtside occurred in the 
furious paced third quarter, resulting in a five-minute delay as officials 
tried to sort things. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy didn't amount to much because Bonita Vista had either a 16-, 
17- or 18-point lead and dominated play from there. Officially, the Barons won 
102-80. 
</P>
<P>
Bonita Vista, by the way, prides itself on defense. Said Coach Jim Conlin 
before the season: "The running game is not our style. We want to push the ball 
up the court, but we're working on our patience. We want to work on getting the 
good shot." 
</P>
<P>
After the lopsided victory, Bonita Vista's seventh in nine games this season 
and second against Chula Vista, the preseason favorite to win the Metro 
Conference, Conlin was reminded of those remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still trying," Conlin said. "It's tough when Chula Vista comes in. They 
like to run and shoot. That's their game. I think we had the patience when we 
needed it." 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista forced the pace early, taking a 10-5 lead in 1:58 with Andy Duran 
scoring seven points, Donnie Edwards making a free throw and sophomore Jerome 
Green making a spectacular two-hand slam after a midcourt steal. 
</P>
<P>
Bonita Vista's David Rusk then hit a three-pointer and Green an 18-foot 
off-balance jump shot to make the score 12-8, Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next seven minutes, however, the game belonged to Bonita Vista as the 
Barons went on a 26-3 run to take control with 5:12 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Bonita Vista led, 44-29, at the half, and officially, 73-59, at the end of 
three quarters. The Barons, who were fifth in the county in scoring defense, 
allowing 51.7 points per game before losing to Castle Park, 90-78, on 
Wednesday, reached the 100-point mark with 1:11 when Rusk made both ends of a 
one-and-one free-throw situation. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Mike Barnett, who led Bonita Vista with 24 points, added two free 
throws with 38 seconds left. Center Rope Perry had only three points in the 
first half, but finished with 17 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't miss early," Barnett said. "We played good as a team, which we 
hadn't been doing." 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista (5-4, 2-2) was led by Green with 32 points. Bonita Vista (7-2, 3-1) 
had defeated Chula Vista, 77-60, in the championship of the Hilltop Tournament 
earlier this month.

PERSISTENCE PAYS FOR CHIEFS' LOWERY; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: KICKER CAUGHT ON IN 12TH TRYOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A man with less perseverance than kicker Nick Lowery would have found another 
line of work a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
In only two seasons, 1978 and 1979, Lowery was released or rejected 11 times by 
eight NFL teams. The Chargers were among those who tried him out and found they 
could get along without him. 
</P>
<P>
To continue eating regularly, Lowery worked as a waiter, a lifeguard, a French 
instructor and a legislative aide to Sens. John Chafee and Robert Packwood. 
After all, he had majored in government at Dartmouth. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Lowery made up his mind that if he ever got another chance, it 
would be his last. Incredibly, in tryout No. 12, with the Kansas City Chiefs in 
1980, he took the kicking job from Jan Stenerud. 
</P>
<P>
And as improbable as that was, Lowery's saga didn't end there. Consider the 
numbers that he will carry into San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium on Sunday when 
the Chiefs hit town for the Chargers' home finale: 
</P>
<P>
* He is the most accurate field-goal kicker in NFL history. He has made 253 
field goals in 322 career attempts (78.6%). 
</P>
<P>
* He holds the league record of 18 field goals of 50 yards or more, including 
two of 58 yards and one of 57. He broke Stenerud's record of 17 last season. 
</P>
<P>
* He holds the league record of eight seasons with at least 100 points, having 
broken a tie with Stenerud this year. 
</P>
<P>
* He has the third highest extra-point percentage of all time -- 99.2% -- with 
372 conversions in 375 attempts. Tommy Davis, formerly of the San Francisco 
49ers, holds the record of 99.4%. Gary Anderson, still kicking for the 
Pittsburgh Steelers, is second at 99.3%. 
</P>
<P>
* He ranks 10th on the all-time scoring list with 1,131 points. George Blanda 
is No. 1 with 2,002. 
</P>
<P>
* He ranks ninth all-time in field goals made with his total of 253. Stenerud 
has the record of 373. 
</P>
<P>
* He was voted into the Pro Bowl this week for the second time. He also made it 
in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, 34, is kicking as well as he ever has, perhaps better. He leads the 
league in both scoring with 118 points and in field goals with 28 in 31 
attempts. Both are career highs, and the Chiefs still have two games to play. 
</P>
<P>
Might he have a chance at Stenerud's career field-goal record? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yes," Lowery said this week. "I think I have a good shot at it. I could do 
it in four or five more years, and I'm sure I can last that long." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for such confidence is that Lowery went on a weight program last 
summer for the first time. Lowery's decision to beef up followed a lackluster 
1989 season. He had his lowest field-goal percentage in eight years, 72.7, 
prodding the Chiefs to try out other kickers. Now, at 6-foot-4 and 205 pounds, 
up from 190, he is in the best condition of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, whose given name is Dominic, was born in Munich, Germany, the son of a 
political analyst for the U.S. State Department. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived in Munich only about eight months," he said. "When I was 8, we moved 
to London, and I played rugby. That's where I learned to kick field goals. 
Later on we moved to Bonn, Germany, where my father was an adviser to 
Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge." 
</P>
<P>
By the the time Lowery reached high school age, his father's duties had taken 
him to Washington, D.C. The family lived in suburban McLean, Va., where a 
next-door neighbor was Supreme Court Justice Byron (Whizzer) White, former star 
NFL running back for the Steelers and Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
At Dartmouth, Lowery played football and baseball, and he aspired to be a 
major-league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Lowery signed as a free agent with the New York Jets after 
graduation in 1978. Thus began the long, tortuous odyssey that was to lead him 
to prominence in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the third preseason game, I was told I would do all the kicking," he 
said. "They said unless I screwed up, I'd have the job. I screwed up, so they 
cut me. I tried a 38-yard field goal, and it was short by three yards." 
</P>
<P>
After that, Lowery was cut four more times -- by the New England Patriots later 
in 1978 and by the Cincinnati Bengals once and the Washington Redskins twice in 
1979. Also, he had unsuccessful auditions with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and 
Philadelphia Eagles in 1978 and the New Orleans Saints, Chargers, Eagles and 
Jets in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Only with the Patriots did Lowery kick in regular-season play. He filled in for 
the injured John Smith for two games in 1978, kicking seven conversions without 
a miss but failing in his only field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a 45-yarder into the wind," he said. "They cut me after that, but it 
just made me get better." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery's experience in Cincinnati wasn't all roses, either. 
</P>
<P>
"Homer Rice was the coach," he said. "When he cut me, he said, 'I can't 
remember you missing a kick.' I felt like punching him." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Lowery was signed twice and released twice in a span of 10 days. 
Bobby Beathard, now general manager of the Chargers, was the Redskins' general 
manager then. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the low point for me," Lowery said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a man named Dick Johnson who taught me about kicking and also about 
life. I was his first protege, starting when I was a freshman in high school. 
When I kept getting cut, he was one of the people along with my parents who 
kept me from getting down on myself. He told me, 'It's not important how many 
times you fall, but how many times you get up.' It was a bromide, but it 
helped." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery got his tryout with the Chargers when they lost Rolf Benirschke for the 
1979 season because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going against Mike Wood, and I outkicked him in training camp," Lowery 
said. "I hit three for six from outside the 40 into a gale wind, and he was 0 
for 6. Yet they kept him, which was the most frustrating cut of all." 
</P>
<P>
Still ahead was Lowery's 11th and last setback, and it came where it had all 
begun, with the Jets. "I outkicked everybody in camp," he said. "But I thought 
to myself, 'These idiots are going to cut me anyway,' and that's what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs called after the 1979 season, an off year for Stenerud. "I had to 
give up my job with the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee," 
Lowery said, "but I wanted to try one more time." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how Stenerud had reacted to him, Lowery said, "He was pleasant; a little 
cool, but pleasant. He thought it was a little bizarre for me to go from 
working in the Senate to playing football. They had brought in kickers every 
year, so I don't think he realized the competition was as serious as it was. 
</P>
<P>
"We split the kicking in the preseason, and that miffed him a little bit. In 
the third game, they told him I'd be doing all the kicking. I felt like I'd 
paid my dues. I made a 42-yarder, and they released him after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get a chance to talk to him then, but since then we've become good 
friends. He's living in Kansas City now. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting cut was a tragic thing for him, but he signed with Green Bay and hit 
22 out of 24 one year. Then he went to Minnesota and made the Pro Bowl. I was 
happy for him." 
</P>
<P>
As pleased as Lowery is to hold the NFL record for field-goal accuracy, he 
won't consider his career complete unless he can kick in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Setting a standard nobody else has done means a lot to me," he said. "But a 
record isn't something you can cuddle up with at night. A Super Bowl ring is."

AZTEC QUARTERBACK MCGWIRE SIGNS WITH AGENT STEINBERG; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: ATTORNEY SAID IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL ABOUT WHERE SDSU STAR WILL GO IN 
DRAFT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Surrounded by NFL jerseys of former San Diego State football players, 
quarterback Dan McGwire took a step into the professional arena Friday when he 
announced that he has retained agent Leigh Steinberg to represent him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was basically a simple (decision)," McGwire said. "I talked to a lot of 
people, sat down with my folks and had attorneys come into our house. Leigh is 
a qualified man and a qualified attorney. He is the best in the business right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg, who represents 17 NFL quarterbacks, joined McGwire for the news 
conference in the players' lounge in the SDSU Football Operations building. He 
and McGwire, dressed casually, talked of the future and its possibilities. They 
talked of McGwire's height, 6-foot-8 (both think it will be an advantage). 
McGwire spoke of where he will play -- anywhere. And Steinberg discussed how 
high McGwire will go in the draft -- too early to speculate, he said, because 
it depends on which juniors will leave college early. 
</P>
<P>
NFL jerseys of SDSU alums Brian Sipe, Webster Slaughter, Rob Awalt and Haven 
Moses, among others, served as a backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
Awalt, a running back at Phoenix, is one of three previous SDSU players 
Steinberg has represented. He specializes in quarterbacks, though, and among 
Steinberg's clients are Jeff George and Troy Aikman, the past two No. 1 draft 
picks, and Andre Ware, last year's Heisman Trophy winner. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan will be a franchise quarterback," Steinberg said. "I represent 17 NFL 
quarterbacks, and on any given week, 10 or 12 of them are starters. Dan is 
right there. He will be an outstanding quarterback. He's a can't-miss." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said it was premature to say what type of contract he will seek for 
McGwire. As a starting base, though, he hinted at the deals signed by three of 
his more well-known clients in the past two years. A year ago, he said, Jeff 
George got $15 million for six years, and Andre Ware got a $2,250,000 signing 
bonus. Two years ago, Troy Aikman got $11 million over six years. 
</P>
<P>
"The top player (in the draft) might be Jeff George plus inflation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, meanwhile, said his role in the community was another factor in 
choosing Steinberg. "I want to be a role model in the community," McGwire said. 
"I want to help the community I'll be playing in. I think I've been a good role 
model in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Said Steinberg: "We talked about a high school scholarship fund at Dan's old 
high school (Claremont), a collegiate fund at San Diego State and a program in 
his pro city. We plan to retrace his roots at every step." 
</P>
<P>
It was Steinberg who teamed with the Chargers' Rolf Benirschke to establish the 
"Kicks for Critters" campaign for the San Diego Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire completed 270 of 449 passes (60%) this fall for 3,833 yards and 27 
touchdowns. He was intercepted just seven times and set an NCAA Division I 
record for lowest interception percentage by a quarterback in a single season 
(1.56%). 
</P>
<P>
McGwire will play in the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala. on Jan. 19 and in the 
East-West Shrine Game in Stanford Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>

After a week in third and three consecutive games lost, the Gulls inched their 
way back into second place in the International Hockey League's Western 
division with a timely 5-2 victory against Kansas City in front of 5,146 at 
Kemper Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Hall has his first two-goal game and forward Ron Duguay scored his first 
goal in four games with the Gulls (16-14-3). 
</P>
<P>
"I was very happy with the way we rebounded," said Gulls Coach Mike O'Connell. 
"This win gives us a spark." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Handy, the second leading scorer in the league, put Kansas City ahead in 
the first two mintues of the game, until Charlie Simmer pulled the Gulls even 
at 17:46, his sixth goal of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls took lead in the second period when Hall scored at 3:16, with Simmer 
on the assist. Then at 4:24, Duguay scored with Darcy Norton assisting, as the 
Gulls took a 3-1 lead after two. 
</P>
<P>
Handy scored again at 5:58, his 24th goal, to pull Kansas City to 3-2, but 26 
seconds laster, Hall scored again, with Mike Sullivan on the assist at 12:31. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Derek Mayer scored his seventh goal, on the power play, and has 
scored a point in 16 of the last 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City outshot the Gulls, 28-20.

Reputed mob boss John Gotti must spend Christmas in jail because a federal 
judge refused to release him on bail pending a trial on racketeering and murder 
charges set for next year. District Judge I. Leo Glasser said the government 
had proved in a "clear and convincing" manner that there were no conditions of 
release that could "reasonably assure the safety of any other person in the 
community." After the three-hour hearing in the Brooklyn federal court, Glasser 
set Jan. 18 for the next hearing in the case.

A state court of appeal rejected the latest effort to upset Proposition 13, 
California's 1978 property tax-slashing ballot measure. The 1st District Court 
of Appeal rejected claims by Macy's department store chain that provisions of 
Proposition 13 are unconstitutional because owners of comparable real estate 
often pay widely varying property taxes, depending on when the property was 
purchased. R.H. Macy &amp; Co. and two subsidiaries sued in Contra Costa County 
Superior Court over the tax bill of the Macy's store at the Sun Valley Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a 1986 change of ownership at the store, taxes rose from $44,000 to 
$117,000 a year, 2.5 times the rate paid by Sears and J.C. Penney at the same 
mall. A state Court of Appeal in Los Angeles rejected a similar argument two 
weeks ago.

KELLY JOHNSON, DESIGN PIONEER OF LOCKHEED AIRCRAFT, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clarence L. (Kelly) Johnson, creator of Lockheed's secret "Skunk Works" 
research and development division and legendary designer of aircraft, died 
Friday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
The planes he designed ranged from the World War II P-38 Lightning to the U-2 
and triplesonic SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed announced that Johnson died at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank 
after a long illness that the company did not describe. 
</P>
<P>
Tony LeVier, Lockheed's former chief test pilot who flew many of Johnson's 
planes, said Friday that Johnson's state-of-the-art aircraft "kept us out of 
World War III." 
</P>
<P>
LeVier said Johnson's planes "flew like a dream." The test pilot described the 
engineer as a stern father figure with great influence in the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was a renowned aircraft engineer from the outset of his career at 
Lockheed in 1933. Within four years, when he was only 27, he won the Lawrence 
Sperry Award for outstanding aeronautics achievement for developing the world's 
fastest commercial air transport. Johnson had personally piloted the craft, 
which flew 250 m.p.h., in some of its test flights. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson founded the "Skunk Works" in 1943 to build the XP-80 Shooting Star, the 
United States' first production jet fighter, for World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Housed in circus tents next to a plastics factory in Burbank, the secret 
facility smelled so bad that engineers dubbed it the "Skunk Works" after the 
foul-smelling moonshine distillery in Al Capp's comic strip "Lil' Abner." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who contributed significantly to the design of more than 40 planes, 
was the key designer of the Constellation or "Connie" transport planes, the 
Hercules cargo planes, the P-2V anti-submarine patrol aircraft, and the Agena 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
His indelible mark was also stamped on the F-104 Starfighter, the first 
production aircraft to fly at twice the speed of sound; the U-2, a favorite 
target of the Soviets in the 1950s and the first plane able to make a sustained 
flight above 60,000 feet, and the YF-12 and SR-71 Blackbird, the world's 
fastest and highest-flying planes. 
</P>
<P>
With the assignment to develop the U-2 under a joint CIA-Air Force request for 
a high-altitude strategic reconnaissance and special-purpose research aircraft 
in 1954, the "Skunk Works" became an autonomous unit of Lockheed, complete with 
its own manufacturing facilities. The complex was formally named Advanced 
Development Projects. 
</P>
<P>
Considered something of a heresy in the aerospace industry because its tiny 
staff and informal operation could sidestep red tape and bureaucratic reports 
associated with government work, the "Skunk Works" became the natural place for 
military leaders to go when they needed something invented and produced 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The unit took only eight months to build the first U-2, code-named "Aquatone." 
It was a U-2 in which Francis Gary Powers was shot down over the Soviet Union 
in 1960 and another U-2 that provided photographic proof in 1962 that the 
Soviets were installing missiles in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's triplesonic Blackbirds were only recently retired by the Air Force. 
The planes could fly faster than 2,000 m.p.h. and higher than 85,000 feet. Even 
on the way to museum display last March, the last Blackbird shattered at least 
three airspeed standards crossing the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Ishpeming, Mich., on Feb. 27, 1910, Johnson learned about tools from 
his Swedish immigrant father, who was a carpenter and bricklayer. 
</P>
<P>
Young Johnson, certain by the age of 12 that he wanted to build planes, studied 
aeronautical engineering at the University of Michigan. He worked on the 
aerodynamic design of cars slated to run in the Indianapolis 500 while studying 
for his master's degree. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's chief aircraft designer for more than three decades, Johnson was 
named vice president for research and development in 1956. The same year, he 
was named Aviation Man of the Year by aviation writers for his development of 
the F-104 supersonic jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Always close-mouthed about his secret research projects, Johnson was known for 
following his own advice: "You can't put your foot in your mouth if you keep 
your mouth shut." 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, after the Soviet Union had shot down a number of his U-2 spy planes, 
Johnson characteristically refused in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars 
to discuss the plane's reconnaissance role. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, during the development of the program, it was essential that 
we learn how to keep our mouths closed," he told the veterans, "and I would 
like to say it would be a splendid idea if we could carry out this tactic in a 
large number of other defense fields." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years Johnson collected laurels as fast as his planes collected speed 
and altitude records. Along with the prestigious Collier trophy and the 
Theodore Von Karman award, Johnson won the Thomas D. White National Defense 
Award for "outstanding contribution to the national defense and security of the 
United States"; the National Medal of Science, presented by President Lyndon B. 
Johnson for the revolutionary U-2; the Sylvanus Albert Reed Award twice from 
the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics for "the most notable 
contribution to aircraft design"; the Kitty Hawk Memorial Award for several 
airplane designs, and the National Security Medal, presented by President 
Ronald Reagan in 1983 for his "original ideas in aerodynamics and aircraft 
design." 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Johnson was inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame at Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"Kelly Johnson and the products of his famous 'Skunk Works' epitomize the 
highest and finest goal of our society, the goal of excellence," noted 
President Johnson in presenting him the Medal of Science. 
</P>
<P>
"His record of design achievement in aviation is both incomparable and 
virtually incredible," the President said. "Any one of his many airplane 
designs would have honored any individual's career." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson retired from Lockheed in 1975 with the title of senior vice president, 
and left the company's board of directors in 1980. In 1987, Lockheed donated 
$350,000 to Caltech to establish the Clarence L. Johnson Professorship in 
Aeronautics. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is survived by his wife, Nancy, a brother and a sister. 
</P>
<P>
Services are scheduled for 2 p.m. Thursday in the forecourt of the Hall of 
Liberty at Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills. Visitation will be at noon that day in 
the Old North Church, Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to St. Joseph 
Medical Center Foundation for Taro Yokoyama's Heart Program, 501 S. Buena Vista 
St., Burbank 91505.

JUDGE SAYS CHEYENNE BRANDO CAN STAY AWAY; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: HE PUTS DENT IN PROSECUTION'S CASE, RULING ACTOR'S DAUGHTER IS 'MENTALLY 
DISABLED' AND CANNOT BE FORCED TO TESTIFY IN HER BROTHER'S MURDER TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Effectively ending a five-month struggle by prosecutors to compel Cheyenne 
Brando to testify at her half-brother's murder trial, a Santa Monica Superior 
Court judge refused Friday to order actor Marlon Brando's daughter to return to 
Los Angeles from Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
In a five-page decision, Judge Joel Rudof declared Cheyenne Brando to be 
"mentally disabled" after two suicide attempts and five recent 
hospitalizations. The judge ruled after examining psychiatric reports and other 
documents, including a declaration from Cheyenne's mother. 
</P>
<P>
Rudof wrote that prosecutors had provided him with "insufficient information to 
permit this court to further endanger what appears to be a fragile mental 
condition and attempt to have Miss Brando returned." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling means that prosecutors will almost certainly have to press forward 
without the star witness in their case against Christian Brando, who is charged 
with killing Cheyenne's Tahitian lover, Dag Drollet, on the night of May 16. It 
may also increase the likelihood of a plea-bargain agreement. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the district attorney said her office will not challenge 
Rudof's decision unless Cheyenne's mental and physical condition improve 
dramatically before the Jan. 14 trial date -- a prospect that she acknowledged 
is slim. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing now is reevaluating our case against Christian Brando 
without the testimony of Cheyenne Brando because it does not appear at this 
time that she will be coming back to testify," said spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
As for a possible plea-bargain, Gibbons said "it would be premature to even 
talk about that at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Robert Shapiro, who represents Christian Brando, could not be 
reached for comment. However, Shapiro has said that he believes a guilty plea 
to a reduced charge of manslaughter would be appropriate for his client. 
</P>
<P>
With its soap opera-like twists and turns, the case against Christian Brando 
has riveted public attention for the last seven months. It has been heart 
wrenching for both families involved. "This case," Marlon Brando once declared, 
"is tearing everyone apart." 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando, 32, has admitted shooting Drollet in the living room of the 
actor's Mulholland Drive estate, but maintains that the gun went off 
accidentally during a struggle between the two men. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that the young Brando murdered Drollet because Cheyenne, at 
the time pregnant with Drollet's child, had complained that Drollet had beaten 
her. 
</P>
<P>
In June, after telling police the shooting was not an accident, Cheyenne flew 
home to Tahiti, where she gave birth to a son. The 20-year-old has reportedly 
tried to take her life twice while in Tahiti, once by a drug overdose and once 
by attempting to hang herself from a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French authorities there filed a complaint that accused her of being 
an accessory in Drollet's murder. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyenne spent the evening of May 16 with Christian, and is considered the only 
witness who could testify about his state of mind and the events leading up to 
Drollet's death. Prosecutors have fought vigorously to compel her return to Los 
Angeles, but also have said that they would drop their efforts if they became 
persuaded that traveling to the United States to testify would damage her 
physical or emotional health.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOMEOWNERS LOSE BID TO BLOCK PORTER 
DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Friday rejected a homeowner group's attempt to block the 
massive Porter Ranch development on the slopes above Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs ruled against a lawsuit by Porter Ranch Is 
Developed Enough (PRIDE) that challenged the Los Angeles City Council's 
approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
PRIDE accused the council of failing to adequately review and describe the 
environmental impacts of the the 1,300-acre, $2-billion project, which is to 
include 3,395 residential units and six million square feet of commercial 
development. PRIDE contended that the project is inconsistent with the city's 
General Plan, which it said never envisioned a commercial core -- with office 
towers and a regional shopping center -- in the Porter Ranch area, but rather 
in Chatsworth.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DECLINES TO BAR MENORAH DISPLAY IN 
PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Promising to schedule a trial on the case before next Hanukkah, a federal judge 
declined Friday to issue an order that would bar the city of Beverly Hills from 
allowing the display of a menorah in a public park near City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The Chabad organization of Hasidic Jews installed a 28-foot menorah in Beverly 
Gardens Park on Dec. 10, prompting the American Jewish Congress to sue for its 
removal as part of a campaign against the public display of creches and other 
religious objects. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter ruled on Dec. 13 that the nine-stemmed 
candelabra could stay, but only if it were displayed next to a Christmas tree, 
which the U.S. Supreme Court has found to be a secular object. City workers 
then draped a nearby tree with colored lights. On Friday, Hatter vacated that 
order but required the city to inform the American Jewish Congress if there are 
any new applications to erect religious displays on government property.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOGS GET PERMANENT RIGHT TO RUN FREE IN 
PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has done its bit to let Rover be Rover. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the Council agreed Friday to designate four-acre Laurel 
Canyon Park as a permanent haven where dogs may run free, exempt from the 
city's leash law. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, 1988, Laurel Canyon Park -- on the south side of Mulholland Drive 
west of Laurel Canyon Boulevard -- has operated as an "experimental" leash-free 
park for dogs, the only facility of its kind in Los Angeles. But the city has 
also kept dog owners on tenterhooks by exempting the park area from the city's 
leash laws only for six months at a time.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN CHARGED WITH KEEPING 35 ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman was charged Friday with illegally keeping 35 live animals in her 
one-bedroom apartment in Hollywood and storing the corpses of 45 cats in her 
kitchen freezer. Roberta Murray, 61, was charged with 34 counts of animal 
neglect and one count each of illegally keeping dead animals, operating an 
unlicensed kennel and refusing to permit an inspection by city animal control 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Animal Regulation Department began investigating Murray 
after receiving complaints from neighbors in her Hollywood apartment building 
on Yucca Avenue who reported a stench coming from her apartment, City Atty. 
James K. Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Animal regulation officers found 33 cats and two dogs living in the apartment 
and the bodies of 45 cats wrapped in aluminum foil in the freezer. The live 
animals were taken to an animal shelter, where officials discovered that all 
the cats and one of the dogs were suffering from a variety of illnesses.

MAN SLAIN BY DEPUTIES AFTER CHASE, CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A robbery suspect driving a stolen car was fatally shot in a gun battle with 
sheriff's deputies after a chase that ended in two-car crash near downtown Los 
Angeles Friday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The chase began when deputies spotted a car in Lynwood that matched the 
description of one used a few hours earlier in a robbery. The pursuit continued 
to Broadway and Adams Boulevard, where the suspect's vehicle hit another car, 
sheared off a fire hydrant and slammed into a building. 
</P>
<P>
A gun battle erupted when the unidentified suspect, who died at County-USC 
Medical Center, jumped from the stolen vehicle, Lynwood deputies said. The 
other motorist, whose name was not available, was critically injured, police 
said.

BREAKAWAY EPISCOPAL CHURCH STILL PRACTICING OLD-TIME RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirteen years after tearing itself from the bosom of the Episcopal Church by 
theological schism and legal strife, the Church of Our Saviour and the Holy 
Apostles is still practicing old-time religion on Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A sign on the outside wall identifies the small, mission-style edifice as 
Episcopal -- Traditional, but most leaders of the Episcopal Church will have 
nothing to do with the breakaway parish. 
</P>
<P>
Its hymnal dates from 1940, rejecting the gender-neutral and theologically 
updated edition that the Episcopal Church adopted in 1982, and its Standard 
Book of Common Prayer uses the stately language of the 1928 edition instead of 
the extensively revised 1979 version. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1923, the church was originally known as Amanda Chapel. Topped by a 
miniature cupola and small bell tower, it sits on a small, triangular city 
block of its own. 
</P>
<P>
According to a worn marble cornerstone, it was dedicated in memory of Amanda 
Anderson McCarthy, the mother of J. Harvey McCarthy, who developed the nearby 
Carthay Circle residential area. 
</P>
<P>
The church was nondenominational until 1947, when it was first identified as 
Episcopal and called the Church of Our Saviour, said its rector, the Rev. 
Donald M. Ashman. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, it offers a stucco-walled sanctuary for a small, old-fashioned 
congregation that could not tolerate the changes that the denomination went 
through in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The rector is a man who was raised in the Roman Catholic faith but found it too 
liberal for his tastes. 
</P>
<P>
While still a layman, he sought a stricter, old-fashioned spiritual home, and 
found it at what used to be the Church of the Holy Apostles, an Episcopal 
parish in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
In the heat of the doctrinal disputes of the 1970s, that congregation left the 
Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, only to lose its building in a bitter court 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
The diocese failed to hold on to the Church of Our Saviour, however, and the 
Glendale group, together with its pastor, merged with the remnants of the 
Olympic Boulevard parish in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
With about 250 people on its rolls, it is linked to about 60 other 
congregations nationwide in the traditionalist Diocese of Christ the King, 
based in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
A Romanian Orthodox congregation also uses the building, and so does a unit of 
the Philippine Independent Church. 
</P>
<P>
Ashman, a former high school teacher of Latin and Greek, said he was recruited 
by the parish's previous priest and ordained by a traditionalist seminary in 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
He said his flock rebelled against "secular humanism" in the Episcopal Church 
-- the ordination of women, tolerance of homosexuality and "the lessened realm 
of personal sin." 
</P>
<P>
"We try to follow what God told us to do in Scripture. That's why we don't go 
along with changes in morality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people from all walks of life, from all socioeconomic classes, from 
all races, but we have a common attitude to God -- we are here to do his will, 
not ours." 
</P>
<P>
Congregants come from as far away as the San Gabriel Valley and the South Bay 
for Mass, where Ashman, dressed in a white vestment and maroon robe, presides 
with the help of an adult acolyte. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Sunday, about 30 worshipers knelt for most of the service on worn, 
red plush footstools as the morning light made a stained glass figure of Christ 
glow on the eastern wall. 
</P>
<P>
A bank of candles in red glass cups flickered under a crucifix against the side 
wall, and a small male choir upstairs, aided by an organist, made a brave try 
at the sacred chants. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to report that (a congregant) has recovered from the shingles, 
but she's feeling miserable, so please keep her in your prayers," Ashman 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
Then he launched into his sermon, saying that the wages of sin are death, and 
that "theologically Orthodox Christians . . . unlike many of our weaker and 
liberal brethren, will not be able to say nobody warned us." 
</P>
<P>
"Within the context of historic Anglicanism -- the Catholic faith -- we carry 
on that faith to the hard-hearted world," he said. "We are here to call them to 
Jesus Christ their Lord and Savior. Everything else -- all our works of mercy 
-- comes afterward." 
</P>
<P>
As chimes rang out in the choir loft, members of the congregation knelt in 
front of the altar, and the priest, chanting, "Behold the Lamb of God . . . the 
Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ," fed them Communion wafers and passed a chalice 
of wine. 
</P>
<P>
In the social hall afterward, there was a modest brunch of coffee, punch, 
cookies and ham sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Dillebe, a real estate finance officer, said he drives in regularly from 
Monrovia in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes 35 minutes but that's OK with me," Dillebe said. "I looked at other 
churches, but I didn't particularly agree with where they are or where they're 
going." 
</P>
<P>
Raised an Anglican in his native Nigeria, he said, "I like the old church 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Cohen of Highland Park, a convert from Judaism, said: "This is a very 
clean, honest church. And people here are very tolerant." 
</P>
<P>
Being married to a black woman, he said, he felt uncomfortable at several other 
churches: "We had to pray our way here." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Lambach, an account executive for a South Bay company, said she grew up 
in the old Church of the Holy Apostles in Glendale but moved with her family to 
Huntington Beach several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried other churches and it wasn't the same," she said. "My mother is 
stubborn. They were just too liberal for us." She plans to be married at the 
Church of Our Saviour next year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the doctrinal differences and the lingering bitterness over the court 
fights, Ashman said, "I have many friends within the mainline denomination who 
fight the same battle from within." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Nicastro, a spokeswoman for the Episcopal Diocese, declined to comment on 
the fortunes of the Church of Our Saviour. 
</P>
<P>
But she said that a "small but very vocal minority" of Episcopalians are indeed 
trying to steer the church in a more traditionalist direction. They were 
prompted in part by the ordination last year of a woman as suffragan 
(assistant) bishop in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally," she said, the presiding bishop of the national church, the Rt. 
Rev. Edmond L. Browning, "is not in favor of this, but . . . he encourages them 
to express themselves. This is the presiding bishop of the 'Church of No 
Outcasts'. He's used that phrase time and again." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, traditional-minded Episcopalians feel that they are being 
"persecuted or marginalized," said the Rev. David Baumann, Southern California 
president of the Episcopal Synod, a traditionalist movement within the larger 
church.

MANY JEWS TURNING TO OLD SYSTEM FOR JUSTICE; 
</P>
<P>
ARBITRATION: BET DIN PROCEEDINGS ARE INEXPENSIVE, QUICK AND RELATIVELY PRIVATE. 
A DRAWBACK, HOWEVER, IS THAT SUCH PANELS LACK POWER TO ENFORCE THEIR DECISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID MARGOLIS, David Margolis is a Los Angeles correspondent for the 
Jerusalem Report, a new English-language news weekly published in Israel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jews needing to arbitrate business and personal disputes are increasingly 
turning to an ancient legal system, whose proceedings are substantially 
cheaper, quicker and more private than civil court. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a "tremendous explosion of interest" recently in arbitrations 
according to Jewish law, says Rabbi Avrohom Teichman, who directs a Los Angeles 
bet din (house of law). 
</P>
<P>
Teichman said his bet din is handling cases such as a property settlement in a 
divorce, a claim against a Jewish religious school by a teacher whose contract 
was not renewed, a dispute between a contractor and a homeowner complaining of 
substandard repair work, a disagreement between two organizations over a debt 
and accusations of slander resulting in the alleged loss of business by a 
high-tech company. 
</P>
<P>
A recent case involved an Orthodox Jew from West Los Angeles who lent his van 
to an acquaintance. Though they talked beforehand about what would happen in 
case of an accident, they misunderstood each other. And when the borrower 
crashed the vehicle, they argued over who should pay for what. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid a lengthy and expensive civil lawsuit and the breakup of their 
friendship, they agreed to have the dispute adjudicated by a bet din. At the 
Los Angeles Kollel, an institute for advanced Jewish learning in the Fairfax 
district, a rabbi appointed a panel of three judges. As is typical in bet din 
cases, the two men signed a contract, enforceable in civil court, obligating 
them to abide by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing evidence, the bet din assigned two-thirds of the repair costs to 
the man who borrowed the van. The progress was free and took only a few hours, 
and the two men have remained friends. 
</P>
<P>
Teichman plans to publish a pamphlet explaining the process. "People are afraid 
to come to a bet din because they don't know the procedure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although most Jewish courts exist within the Orthodox community, where 
adherence to traditional law is strictest, even many non-Orthodox Jews are 
using the system to arrange matters of personal status, such as conversions and 
divorces. 
</P>
<P>
They may do so out of respect for Jewish tradition or to avoid future problems 
for themselves or their children. They may also want to protect their 
immigration and marriage rights in Israel, where all matters of personal status 
are regulated by the Orthodox rabbinate, which does not accept conversions or 
divorces implemented by non-Orthodox authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Judaism, which is less strict in it adherence to traditional 
Jewish law, has a single bet din in Los Angeles, located at the University of 
Judaism. It primarily handles conversions and divorces, according to Rabbi Ben 
Zion Bergman, its director. Reform Judaism has eliminated the institution of 
the bet din altogether. "We do not function as if bound by Halacha (Jewish 
law), so it would be inappropriate for us to set up a bet din," explained Rabbi 
Leonard Thal, director of the local region of the Union of American Hebrew 
Congregations, the Reform umbrella group. 
</P>
<P>
Members of other religions, including Roman Catholics, Mormons and 
Presbyterians, also have court systems but they generally only adjudicate 
ecclesiastical matters and issues of personal status. Among Muslims, 
traditional Islamic law, called the sharia, is also used to adjudicate business 
and personal matters. In Los Angeles, according to spokesman Maher Hathout, the 
Islamic Center of Southern California has only "unofficial" arbitration 
services, in which a single arbitrator will attempt to resolve issues. 
</P>
<P>
Many cities with large Orthodox Jewish populations have a sitting bet din. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no such arrangement in Southern California. In the extremely 
decentralized Orthodox community, the closest thing to an official bet din is 
operated by the Rabbinical Council of California, directed by Rabbi Shmuel 
Katz, a world-acknowledged Jewish legal expert. Katz's bet din handles 
virtually all the Orthodox conversions in Los Angeles and probably more than 
half of the 50 or so Jewish divorces settled here each month. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish law does not always work, however, as smoothly as it did in the case of 
the wrecked van. One inherent weakness of the bet din is that it lacks the 
power to enforce its decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, for example, a conflict erupted between Chabad, the Hasidic group, 
and the Westwood Bayit, a cooperative Jewish student house near the UCLA 
campus. Both organizations claimed ownership of the Bayit building on 
fraternity row and other properties worth a total of $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
When Chabad, holding an apparently valid deed, took over the Westwood building 
and converted it into a shelter for temporarily homeless men, Bayit supporters 
claimed that the deed had been obtained fraudulently. 
</P>
<P>
The Bayit lodged a formal complaint with Teichman, whose bet din issued a 
"summons" to Chabad. Instead of having Teichman appoint the judges on the bet 
din, the two organizations agreed on a procedure in which each appointed one 
judge. The two judges then were to pick a third, neutral judge. 
</P>
<P>
The process stalled, however, when Chabad challenged the Bayit's choice for a 
judge. The Bayit has reopened its case in civil court, which it had dropped in 
order to speed the bet din procedure. The civil process could take five years 
and cost thousands of dollars, said Bayit board President Leonard Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
Cost can be one clear advantage of the bet din. 
</P>
<P>
While the free services provided by Los Angeles Kollel are rare, the process is 
usually inexpensive. Teichman, for example, says he charges a $50 filing fee 
and $300 for each hour spent by the judges in hearing a dispute, plus $200 an 
hour for time the judges confer. Additional fees of about $40 an hour are 
levied for writing the decision, if that is required. "An average case -- not 
an especially complex one -- will cost a total of $500," Teichman estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of the bet din is its privacy. Since its hearings and records 
are not public, it is a venue particularly suited to litigants anxious to avoid 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
The process is also quick. Cases can often be completed in days or weeks. 
Teichman said that the Chabad-Bayit dispute could have been settled in less 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
The bet din's difficulty in enforcing its decisions, however, may be 
complicated by the politics, relationships and communal intimacy of those 
involved. One Orthodox rabbi cited an example in which a divorced husband would 
not comply with the bet din's order to pay his children's day-school tuition. 
</P>
<P>
The bet din could have put pressure on the man to comply by publicizing his 
recalcitrance in the Jewish community, or at least to school authorities, but 
it avoided doing so in deference to his wealth and community position. 
</P>
<P>
Communal pressure applied privately is often the bet din's best weapon for 
obtaining compliance, especially in cases in which one partner in a marriage 
refuses to allow a divorce to be completed. "In Europe, the bet din could 
actually ostracize a member of the community," said Rabbi David Rue, who has 
served as a bet din judge. "Here, they apply pressure through a person's rabbi 
or friends." 
</P>
<P>
This system of Jewish courts dates back to the time of Moses, who, according to 
the book of Exodus, delegated to wise elders part of his authority as judge in 
order to speed the administration of justice. 
</P>
<P>
Although Jewish law specifically requires Jews to submit their disputes to a 
bet din, even many religious Jews prefer to go to civil court. Some may simply 
have the expectation of getting a better settlement under civil law. Others may 
be loath to apply Jewish law to contracts they entered into under civil law, 
especially given the bet din's lack of enforcement powers. 
</P>
<P>
There have been cases in which the civil courts have refused to enforce a bet 
din's decision even though the parties had signed a binding-arbitration 
agreement. The courts cited the Jewish court's failure to render its decision 
clearly or the inability to fully understand the actual legal basis of the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles lawyer Stephen Webb, who has worked with Jews using the bet din 
system, explained that there are "difficulties of interface" between the two 
legal systems. "There is a need to train rabbis in writing decisions that can 
be used in civil court," he said.

CLERICAL OPPOSITION TO WAR IN GULF BUILDS QUICKLY; 
</P>
<P>
PROTEST: UNLIKE VIETNAM, MAINLINE RELIGIOUS LEADERS HAVE COME OUT EARLY AND IN 
UNPRECEDENTED UNANIMITY AGAINST POSSIBLE USE OF U.S. MILITARY FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Thousands of Americans had died in Vietnam and years of warfare had passed by 
the late 1960s before most religious leaders became actively involved in the 
movement to stop the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, within weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait, ranking clerics ranging from 
Catholics to Lutherans to Episcopalians began opposing the possible use of 
military force by U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
With U.S. troops still amassing in Saudi Arabia and Iraq facing a U.N. deadline 
to pull out by Jan. 15, mainline church leaders have reached unprecedented 
unanimity and stepped up their anti-war lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning of the Episcopal Church met Thursday with 
President Bush, a lifelong Episcopalian, at the White House and urged against 
war. Then, on Friday, Browning and 18 Protestant and Eastern Orthodox church 
executives -- just back from a trip to Baghdad and other Middle Eastern points 
-- said in a collective statement at the United Nations that they are "utterly 
convinced" that war is not the solution. 
</P>
<P>
They have not been persuaded by Bush Administration reasons for fighting, 
including protecting economic interests and punishing an aggressor. Many are 
anguishing over the billions being spent for a military buildup while domestic 
poverty programs go begging. 
</P>
<P>
Harking back to the long, bloody lessons of Korea and Vietnam, a chorus of 
mainline church leaders say the time has come to settle international disputes 
through nonviolent means. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no compelling reason for going to war, and all that war means in 
destruction, crippling and killing," said Catholic Bishop Thomas Gumbleton, who 
spent eight days in Baghdad this month accompanying relatives of hostages. 
</P>
<P>
"For 40 years, ever since the Korean War, people were easily swayed (to back 
fighting) by the threat of communism," said Gumbleton, an auxiliary bishop in 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
War of any kind "is abhorrent," said the Rev. Daniel Weiss, general secretary 
of the American Baptist Churches. The fact that the Bush Administration 
initially offered "economically grounded reasons" for fighting especially 
disturbed church leaders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time of year particularly, we are reminded of the coming of the Prince 
of Peace who has called us to be peacemakers in his name, and we need to urge 
the governments of the world to find alternate ways to settle differences," 
Weiss said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The United States "has not learned anything" from its wars in Korea and 
Vietnam, said United Methodist Bishop Melvin Talbert of San Francisco, a 
onetime Los Angeles pastor who took part in anti-war protests during the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The contrast between today's anti-war spirit in mainline Christianity and the 
slowly evolving views about Vietnam have heartened religious veterans of the 
1960s protests. 
</P>
<P>
"It is remarkable that wide religious opposition has already taken place in the 
case of this projected war," said the Rev. John C. Bennett, former president of 
Union Theological Seminary in New York now in retirement in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who was writing magazine editorials against U.S. involvement in 
Vietnam by 1965, recalled that most religious leaders did not reach a consensus 
against that war until 1969. It was not until November, 1971, that the U.S. 
Catholic bishops declared it was morally imperative to bring "this tragic 
conflict" to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"Bishops are historically, naturally inclined to be patriotic, and not to 
condemn their own government," said Jesuit Father George H. Dunne, a retired 
Loyola Marymount professor. 
</P>
<P>
"But the bishops have done a lot more thinking about war since the Vietnam War 
ended in 1975," he said, citing the long study preceding the 1983 U.S. Bishops 
Pastoral Letter on War and Peace that was highly critical of the nuclear arms 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Just weeks into the current crisis, top officials from mainline denominations 
began questioning the White House's impatience with an economic embargo, 
inconsistent objectives and what the president of the United Church of Christ 
called "the steady drumbeat of war messages." 
</P>
<P>
But it took Bush's announcement on Nov. 8 that he would double U.S. troop 
strength to galvanize opposition by the two largest bodies in U.S. organized 
religion -- the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, whose parishes serve 
54 million Catholics, and the National Council of Churches, whose 32 
denominations embrace 42 million members. 
</P>
<P>
Both groups were holding their annual meetings the following week and both 
promptly placed the buildup on their agendas. 
</P>
<P>
Not all religious groups, however, are raising objections to a possible U.S. 
military offensive. 
</P>
<P>
American Jewish leaders and evangelical Christian clergy on the whole see Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein as a dangerous, unpunished threat who needs to be 
declawed lest Israel and other Middle Eastern countries fall prey in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish community "is particularly sensitive over whether some interest of 
Israel is going to be sacrificed in interest of appeasing Saddam Hussein," said 
Rabbi David Gordis, director of the Wilstein Institute of Jewish Policy Studies 
at the University of Judaism in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The memory of appeasement to Adolf Hitler in the late 1930s is also at work 
among Jews, said Gordis, a rabbi in the conservative wing of Judaism. "To rule 
out any response of force, even as a last resort, cannot help but be described 
as capitulation to evil, something that is wrong philosophically and 
ideologically and pragmatically won't work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted without dissent last month by the Council of Jewish 
Federations backed "the maintenance of a firm posture of position to Saddam 
Hussein's belligerence." 
</P>
<P>
Jewish tradition regards preemptive military action as a form of legitimate 
defense if diplomatic means fail, said Union of American Hebrew Congregation's 
board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Reform rabbis, in an executive committee statement, urged Bush to seek legal 
means to charge Hussein with war crimes and reject any linking of Iraqi 
withdrawal from Kuwait to other Mideast issues. "Should peaceful means proved 
inadequate, we support the timely use of force in consonance with American 
constitutional procedures to reduce Iraq to a regional power and to remove the 
nuclear, biological and chemical warfare threats," the rabbis said. 
</P>
<P>
Most conservative evangelical leaders have been quietly supporting the 
direction of Bush's policies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't hear groups complaining," said Robert Dugan, a Washington-based 
representative of the National Assn. of Evangelicals. "I think the great bulk 
of the evangelical community would support President Bush's policies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson has condemned Iraq's ruler as a "madman" 
developing a nuclear weapon threat. 
</P>
<P>
It is crucial for the stability of the Middle East and the existence of Israel 
that Hussein "be removed from Kuwait, from power and his arsenal dismantled," 
hw said. 
</P>
<P>
While never using such strident language, Catholic and mainline Protestant 
leaders initially backed Bush's deployment of troops to enforce the U.N.-backed 
economic blockade of Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
But that changed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony was in the forefront for the Catholics 
in his final weeks as chairman of the bishops' International Policy Committee. 
</P>
<P>
After a mid-September letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker II asking 
that food and medicine not be denied to Iraqi citizens, Mahony said in an 
interview: "I, and my committee and other bishops began looking at the 
situation more carefully. It was beginning to have an ominous shift." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony prepared a second letter to Baker in late October, raising moral 
objections to the possible use of force and laying out Catholic criteria for a 
"just war." The letter was purposely not mailed until one day after the Nov. 6 
elections, Mahony said, so that it could not "be used by people in various ways 
not intended by us." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Bush announced that he would double troop strength in the gulf to give 
the United States more offensive capability. Four days later, the nation's 250 
Catholic bishops gathered in Washington for their annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"So many bishops wanted to associate themselves with Archbishop Mahony's letter 
that it was put on the agenda as the first item of business," said a staff 
official at the bishops' headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Catholic bishops, the National Council of Churches, holding its 
general board meeting Nov. 14-16 in Portland, Ore., had not originally 
scheduled discussion on the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The Council, whose denominations run from liberal-to-moderate mainline 
Protestant to the normally reserved Eastern Orthodox churches, were also 
stirred by the troop buildup announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"That really turned things," said Dale Bishop, the Middle East director for the 
New York-based Council. "I was bowled over by the amount of energy behind this 
particular issue," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 delegates gave unanimous approval to a resolution calling for a major 
reduction in U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf and direct U.S. negotiations with 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Public reactions to religious pronouncements are hard to measure, said 
Archbishop John Roach of the Minneapolis-St. Paul diocese, who testified Dec. 6 
before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as the bishops' new international 
policy chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"But the fact that church leaders raise these questions, I think, makes it 
easier for people to raise such questions and not feel they are disloyal," 
Roach said. "We help them form a language that can be used in urging steps to 
avoid war." 
</P>
<P>
Churches have kept up their public commentary at each new twist in the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
A national meeting early this month in Los Angeles of about 70 clergy and lay 
regional officials of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) praised Bush 
for his proposal of high-level, U.S.-Iraqi talks in Baghdad and Washington. But 
the group's pastoral letter, expressing "grave concerns" over war, asked its 1 
million members to write to government leaders to support all diplomatic 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, United Methodists in 400 Southern California and Hawaii churches were 
recently asked by their regional Council on Ministries to write Congress and 
the White House, and to cite denominational principles against "interventions 
by more powerful nations against weaker ones." The council also suggested peace 
vigils and armbands to symbolize their concern. 
</P>
<P>
Many church leaders say they hope to balance their opposition to war with 
compassion and sensitivity toward church members involved in the military 
buildup. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that we don't make the same mistakes that were made 
during the Vietnam conflict, where criticism of the conflict was taken as 
criticism of the individuals caught up in that conflict," said Steve Smith, a 
Presbyterian regional official based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no hawks. Most are hoping that it will end peacefully," said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Some local congregations near Southern California military bases have conducted 
letter-writing campaigns to servicemen and women stationed in Saudi Arabia. 
About 550 Frisbees with personal Christmas greetings attached will be 
distributed Dec. 25 to troops in Saudi Arabia -- courtesy of members of the 
Northridge United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
Among vigils for peace held in the Southland was a day of prayer and fasting 
Friday at New Life Community Church in Artesia, a Reformed Church in America 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
Many church leaders plan more than prayer. 
</P>
<P>
A newly formed Religious Community Against War in the Persian Gulf, based at 
Pasadena's activist All Saints Episcopal Church, mailed a theological rationale 
for opposition to war to 2,500 priests and ministers in the Los Angeles area as 
well as to selected Reform Jewish rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
"At least a half-dozen rabbis have responded favorably to our stance to resist 
war," said an All Saints staff member. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Leonard Beerman, one of the coalition organizers, cited several reasons 
for his stance, including his belief that "war is not the way to resolve 
international conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
Just as a small number of rabbis oppose military action, evangelical opinions 
are not unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
A letter to Bush calling for peaceful settlement under U.N. auspices circulated 
at the evangelical Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena and got more than 
200 student signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Events in the Middle East have sparked new speculation by some fundamentalist 
preachers about whether the convergence of major armies signals "the last days" 
before the return of Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dugan, of the National Assn. of Evangelicals, said fatalism is not 
sweeping churches. 
</P>
<P>
"Responsible evangelicals are going to desire peace and work for it," he said. 
"At the same time, it doesn't hurt to take an intelligent look at the 
Scriptures to see what may fit. I don't think it's frivolous."

GORBACHEV FAILS TO TALK SHEVARDNADZE OUT OF RESIGNING; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: BUT A TOP KREMLIN ADVISER SAYS THE DEPARTING FOREIGN MINISTER MAY 
MOVE TO ANOTHER LEADERSHIP POST ON THE PRESIDENT'S 'TEAM.'

<P>
With world leaders worried about the future of Soviet foreign policy and 
domestic politics abuzz with confused speculation, President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev met on Friday with Eduard A. Shevardnadze for a two-hour talk that 
failed to persuade the foreign minister to withdraw his bombshell resignation. 
</P>
<P>
But a close Gorbachev adviser said he believed that Shevardnadze, who announced 
his resignation Thursday as a protest against what he termed the country's 
encroaching "dictatorship," could still move to another leadership post. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure Shevardnadze will stay on Gorbachev's team," Georgy K. Shakhnazarov, 
a political scientist who advises Gorbachev on domestic reforms, told the 
official news agency Tass. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze's future and the real motives behind his resignation dominated 
gossip in the marble halls of the Congress of People's Deputies, the national 
Parliament, on Friday, with theories of Byzantine political machinations 
abounding and few people willing to accept the foreign minister's word that he 
resigned in outrage at criticism from reactionaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Either Gorbachev pushed him into it, or Gorbachev let him know he was prepared 
to sacrifice him, or this is all just some maneuver," Leningrad Deputy Yuri 
Boldyrev speculated. "I'm still trying to understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Vitaly N. Ignatenko, Gorbachev's spokesman, appeared in the Congress' lobby on 
a mission of reassurance in the late afternoon to tell reporters that the 
Soviet president and Shevardnadze had just met for a long talk, mainly on 
day-to-day foreign affairs, including the crisis in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Shevardnadze had changed his mind about leaving, Ignatenko said, 
"Everything remains as it was in his speech, but he is continuing to fulfill 
his functions." 
</P>
<P>
As for the concern expressed by Western leaders and political scientists that 
Shevardnadze's resignation heralds a turn for the worse, at home and in foreign 
policy, Ignatenko said: "Gorbachev will study the reaction from abroad with the 
calmness characteristic of him." 
</P>
<P>
And in a move calculated to signal that the Soviet Union's foreign policy 
remained unchanged, despite Shevardnadze's resignation, Gorbachev sent a 
message to the Gulf Cooperation Council reaffirming Moscow's support for the 
U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to confirm the determination of the Soviet Union to stand by 
international law and achieve restoration of the sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of Kuwait," said the message, carried by Tass. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond a printed appeal signed by 22 reformist deputies for a broad coalition 
of democratic forces, Shevardnadze's stunning gesture did not immediately have 
the effect that he said he wanted -- persuading liberals who had "run away into 
the bushes" to stand and fight the government's shift toward the reactionary 
right. 
</P>
<P>
But his warnings of dictatorship brought a powerful response, with several 
speakers at the Congress carrying them even further. 
</P>
<P>
Anatoly A. Sobchak, the mayor of Leningrad, predicted that, if the economy 
continued to disintegrate, then within months, "All of us, democrats, radicals 
and conservatives, will come scraping and bowing to the military and say 'Come 
and rule us.' " 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir K. Chernyak, a deputy from the Ukraine, said: "Gorbachev himself 
stands at the center of the coup, even if he doesn't realize it. By demanding 
more and more powers for himself, he's creating the legal foundations for a 
dictatorship -- possibly not for himself." 
</P>
<P>
The warnings came as the Congress began to address key constitutional 
amendments that Gorbachev has proposed to increase his presidential powers, 
replacing the overgrown Council of Ministers with a Cabinet directly 
subordinate to him and adding the post of vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Several Congress deputies and observers from Georgia, Shevardnadze's home 
republic, said they believe it was the issue of the vice presidency that 
prompted the foreign minister's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev disclosed Thursday that he had planned to nominate Shevardnadze as 
his No. 2 in command. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, said Klara Abramiya, correspondent for the state-run Georgian Republic 
newspaper, "Gorbachev betrayed him" by planning to make Shevardnadze take on, 
with the vice presidency, the dirtiest of the country's work -- suppressing 
separatist movements in the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics in a 
last-ditch attempt to keep the country together. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to do everything through his hands. And he'd never agree to 
sending the army into Tbilisi," she said, referring to the Georgian capital. 
</P>
<P>
Abramiya predicted Shevardnadze "will never return" to the post that won him 
worldwide acclaim over five years of revolutionizing Soviet foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Tass quoted a similar analysis from "a formerly prominent Soviet diplomat" it 
did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
"Shevardnadze was definitely aware that the post of vice president was being 
reserved for him, and not wishing to assume unpopular domestic 
responsibilities, which he could not avoid in such a post during this critical 
period of the country's history, he decided to take a step that would make his 
election impossible," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Other unsubstantiated theories circulating at the Congress held that 
Shevardnadze wanted to go back to Georgia and help in its nationalist revival; 
that he simply got carried away with his emotions and would eventually consent 
to be vice president; that he planned to transfer his loyalties to Russian 
Federation leader Boris N. Yeltsin, Gorbachev's political nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
But Shevardnadze offered no further public explanations on Friday. His 
spokesman, Vitaly I. Churkin, would not discuss the resignation further. 
</P>
<P>
The popular foreign minister's resignation mystified, but it also reawakened 
interest in politics among Soviet citizens, who have largely lost faith in 
Gorbachev's reforms and become far more interested in finding food. 
</P>
<P>
A newspaper editor from the Black Sea port of Sevastopol said that for the 
first time in months, he heard passengers on the bus talking about national 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Shevardnadze has shaken everyone," he said. "This has had a really big 
resonance. People are even forgetting about the shortage of food." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the traditional Soviet press tended to bury Shevardnadze's dramatic 
speech in the middle of long reports on the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
But the army newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda bannered its front page with the 
headline "Is Shevardnadze Leaving?" 
</P>
<P>
And the new Nezavisimaya Gazeta, or Independent Newspaper, featured a grid of 
photographs of top government officials with a box over the title "foreign 
minister" filled only by a big, black question mark.

BOLD RIGHTISTS PRESS CAUSE IN UNEASY MOSCOW

<P>
Brash, angry and playing by its own set of rules, the new Soviet right now has 
the world's undivided attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I stand before you a reactionary, a hawk, scum," one of its leaders, Col. 
Viktor I. Alksnis, of the reactionary Soyuz (Union) faction, told the Soviet 
Congress hours after Eduard A. Shevardnadze, complaining of right-wing 
"hounding," quit Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Like the black-haired Latvian colonel, other military officers, Communist 
militants and ethnic Russians from outlying areas are disgusted at recent 
events. 
</P>
<P>
To hear them, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has made too many concessions in 
U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations, "lost" East Germany and pursued policies that 
may doom the very existence of the Soviet state. 
</P>
<P>
But Soyuz members are better at articulating what they oppose than they are at 
offering alternatives to Gorbachev's perestroika program. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, when a nursing baby is thrown into a fire, I am a hawk," Alksnis told the 
Congress, referring to atrocities committed in the ethnic unrest that has 
become common under Gorbachev. "When a pregnant woman is thrown out of a 
ninth-floor window, I am a hawk. When an old man is skinned alive, I'm a hawk." 
</P>
<P>
By calling himself "scum," Alksnis was derisively taking up the label bestowed 
on Shevardnadze's foes by prominent liberal writer Ales Adamovich. 
</P>
<P>
Where old-style conservatives, such as former Politburo member Yegor K. 
Ligachev, were basically content to work within the system, seeking to brake or 
channel Gorbachev's economic and political reforms, the new breed of rightist 
seems to oppose absolutely all change. 
</P>
<P>
Also, unlike Establishment conservatives, the new Soviet right has gone public 
with criticism and even contemptuous words about Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Alksnis' comrade, Col. Nikolai S. Petrushenko, was asked recently what he 
thought of his commander in chief. He said Gorbachev is a nice man but 
indecisive. "He must be pushed," Petrushenko said. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze earned Soyuz's enmity for the same achievements in foreign policy 
that helped win Gorbachev the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize. "The minister made too 
many concessions to the West," Petrushenko said. "Witness the unjustifiably 
hasty withdrawal of our half-million-strong military contingent from the 
Eastern European countries." 
</P>
<P>
For Soyuz, it is the height of stupidity that their government, in the person 
of Shevardnadze, has voted at the United Nations to authorize the use of force 
to counter Iraqi aggression in the Persian Gulf, but has not sent in its own 
army to crush secessionist leaderships in the Baltic republics and Soviet 
Caucasus. 
</P>
<P>
Few believe that the pinpricks of Soyuz alone were sufficient to drive 
Shevardnadze off the political stage. Shevardnadze asked aloud who the backers 
of Soyuz really are, and undoubtedly, their political impact has been far out 
of proportion to the votes they can muster in the Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
For example, only 426 deputies of all stripes, about a fifth of the Congress of 
People's Deputies, voted Monday in favor of holding a vote of no confidence in 
Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Soyuz can claim that it has driven three progressives of the first rank 
from their jobs: Shevardnadze, longtime Gorbachev ally Alexander N. Yakovlev 
and Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin. 
</P>
<P>
Still, other members of the Congress are worried. 
</P>
<P>
"Reactionaries, centralizers and imperialists have united to take the 
offensive," Vladimir K. Chernyak of the Ukraine warned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Views vary on whether Soyuz is the mouthpiece of the conservative power 
brokers, whom Lithuanian lawmaker Nikolai Medvedev dubs "the gray cardinals," 
or whether the group is just a band of loudmouthed extremists. Gorbachev's 
recent actions, however, show he is increasingly tailoring his policies to 
appeal to the KGB, Soviet army, police and other institutions from which 
conservatives draw much of their support. 
</P>
<P>
The right, reform economist Pavel G. Bunich told reporters, is now composed of 
"a very big part of the party apparatus, a big part of the Soviets (local 
government councils), the labor unions and the overt rightist forces that you 
know, like Pamyat (the Russian nationalist organization) and the 
military-industrial complex." 
</P>
<P>
By sounding the alarm about the looming danger of a Soviet "dictatorship," 
Shevardnadze, one of the founding fathers of perestroika, was evidently trying 
to end Gorbachev's courtship of the right. But he also was trying to force a 
rallying of increasingly dispersed progressives around the Soviet president. 
</P>
<P>
Some fear it may already be too late and that Gorbachev may already have become 
an accomplice or a prisoner of the right wing. 
</P>
<P>
"Who will be next?" Nikolai Tutov, a Social Democrat, asked after 
Shevardnadze's resignation. "I don't rule out that the initiator of perestroika 
himself, Mikhail Gorbachev, will be next."

PROPAGANDA, DRILLS READY IRAQI HOME FRONT FOR WAR; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: BAGHDAD CLAIMS A MILLION JOIN A PRACTICE EVACUATION. THE 
ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH FOREBODINGS.

BANI SAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the week since proposals for U.S.-Iraq talks reached a dead end, the 
atmosphere in Baghdad has become charged with forebodings of impending war. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, thousands of impoverished Iraqis in Saddam City, a north Baghdad 
suburb, participated in a practice air-raid evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
At a dusty field outside Bani Sad, a drab town of squat, yellowish houses 12 
miles northeast of the capital, about 4,000 men, women and children lolled in 
clusters on scattered mats, festively picnicking in the pale morning sun. 
Several thousand evacuees made their way to another concentration at Rashdiya, 
nearer Saddam City. 
</P>
<P>
The government claimed that a million residents -- a quarter of Baghdad's 
population -- took part in the exercise, a figure impossible to verify. 
</P>
<P>
If war broke out, evacuees would be dispersed among families living in nearby 
provinces, civil defense officials said. "This is a precautionary measure for 
all eventualities," said an official who gave his name as Ali Hussein, the 
Iraqi equivalent of John Doe. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Baghdad read into the evacuation at least two interpretations: a 
genuine need on the part of the government to organize the population, or at 
least to involve it in readiness activities; and the desire to signal 
Washington that Iraq is unbowed even under threat of attack. 
</P>
<P>
Although the evacuation was the most palpable sign of civil defense 
preparation, Iraqis have been bombarded all week with lessons on how to get 
ready for war. Each night on television, ominous civil defense instructions 
promise the worst, and, in some ways, are more alarming than educational. 
</P>
<P>
On one TV show, a picture of agitated molecules appeared on the screen, a voice 
explaining the concept of chain reactions. Then, a black-and-white image of a 
mushroom cloud appeared, and the real message began: Iraq may come under 
nuclear attack -- protect yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Rough drawings instructed viewers how to react to the explosion's sudden flash 
by throwing themselves on the ground face down, feet toward the blast, and 
covering the backs of their heads with their hands. In another segment, a woman 
demonstrated how to use a dish towel, held over mouth and nose, as a substitute 
for a gas mask. 
</P>
<P>
For some residents of Baghdad, there is an inescapable logic to the media 
blitz: It would be best to leave the city before Jan. 15, the deadline set by 
the United Nations for Iraq to pull out of Kuwait. After that, the vast 
U.S.-led military machine gathering over the horizon in Saudi Arabia is 
authorized to strike. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad is certain to be bombed, many residents believe, because a power plant, 
an oil refinery, military bases and the presidential palace all stand within 
the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
"Every night, my wife asks me when we are going to go," confessed a rug 
merchant in the bazaar at Rusafa, Baghdad's inner-city commercial district. His 
cousin lives on a date farm near Karbala, southwest of Baghdad. The family 
could pack flour and clothes and be safe within hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"She tells me no one is buying rugs anyway," the merchant said. "We will see as 
the time gets closer." 
</P>
<P>
For others, the warlike climate has induced a gloomy fatalism. This is not, 
after all, the first time Iraq has mobilized for war. 
</P>
<P>
"You must remember, we had eight years of war with Iran," said Zeinab, a 
30-year-old secretary for a foreign company. "We are used to this. I don't 
think we will go anywhere. Just stay at home." 
</P>
<P>
Zeinab was watching television in her three-bedroom house in Adhamiiya, a 
middle-class district of Baghdad, when the mushroom cloud came on the screen. 
"Well, if it is atomic bombs, what good will that do?" she asked skeptically. 
"I mean, what was left of Hiroshima after an atomic bomb?" 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for air raids, the government has ordered landlords to prepare 
bomb shelters. But it is unclear just how much can be done. Baghdad sits on a 
marshy riverfront, and basements are a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
Instructions for blackouts also were issued in the official Al Thawra newspaper 
"to reduce the chances for enemy aircraft to see cities and vital targets." 
</P>
<P>
At the sound of sirens, residents are supposed to turn off lights, or, if in 
their cars, to stop and turn off headlights. In case of a surprise attack, 
power stations will be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
In schools, children are receiving civil defense tips, such as how to hide 
under desks and how to wash off chemical poison. 
</P>
<P>
"My son came from school and wanted to take a shower right away," recounted 
Zubeide, who works in a bakery in Mansur, a wealthy neighborhood of the 
capital. "He thought the teacher meant he had to wash the chemicals every day. 
It is confusing for a 7-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
There is no indication the United States or its allies is preparing to use 
chemical or nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
But Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Friday that an American attack against 
Iraqi forces is growing increasingly likely. Cheney promised cheering U.S. 
troops that they won't sit indefinitely in the desert and said "absolute, total 
victory" is the only option if war begins. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Cheney in hawkish pep rallies with troops in the northeast Saudi desert 
was Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, who said he still 
hopes for resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis without war. But he then drew 
roars of applause when he pledged: "When we launch it, we will launch it 
violently; we will launch it in a way that will make it decisive so we can get 
it over as quickly as possible and there's no question who won." 
</P>
<P>
In its war with Iran, Iraq attacked its own rebellious Kurdish citizens in the 
northern part of the country with poison gas. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the spurt of civil defense decrees, an expanded military draft 
decisively brought home the approaching zero hour. The government recently 
extended the age of draft eligibility to 33, bringing tens of thousands of men 
who thought they were free of duty back into the service. 
</P>
<P>
Police randomly stop cars carrying youths to inspect their papers to see if 
they are subject to military service. In some neighborhoods, draftees are 
loaded into buses after being discovered by military police, who carry out 
lightning raids and inspections of stores and factories, looking for draft 
dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, not everyone is eager to go. The recent issuance of an amnesty for 
draft evaders and deserters suggested resistance. 
</P>
<P>
To counter such reluctance, the government has fashioned a patriotic media 
campaign. Singers croon about the glories of Iraqi history. 
</P>
<P>
On an episode of a daily army program, a parade of recruits was videotaped 
marching down a street in the town of Mosul; the parade was shown for 15 
minutes without commentary, backed only by the tinny sound of recorded martial 
music. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every night on television, units of soldiers at the front perform a 
chant of defiant slogans and pledges of loyalty to Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
More than the defense of Iraq or Kuwait, it seems, the propaganda campaign 
centers on the glorification of Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
New television images of the mustachioed leader show him atop a white horse as 
he inspects troops. Another presents him meandering through a crowd of adoring 
children as he pats them on the cheek and stoops to kiss them. 
</P>
<P>
One musical interlude features shots of the omnipresent statues of the leader, 
who declared in an interview broadcast Friday on German television that "Allah 
is on our side" and that his troops will not pull out of Kuwait before the Jan. 
15 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Predicting Iraq's triumph in any combat, he added: "From our side, the door to 
dialogue remains open." 
</P>
<P>
In Iraq, the flip side of the propaganda effort is the intense attack on the 
United States in general and President Bush in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Editorial cartoons are not subtle. One showed a boy and dog urinating on a 
Bush-faced Statue of Liberty. Washington's ties with Israel are a favorite 
theme and, in one drawing, Bush is dressed as a centurion holding a shield 
decorated with the Star of David.

WINTER MAKES ITS ENTRY WITH COLD AND SNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Winter made an authentic entrance Friday into Southern California as a massive 
Arctic weather system scattered light snow along the oceanfront from the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula to San Clemente and temperatures dropped close to freezing 
throughout much of the Los Angeles metropolitan region. 
</P>
<P>
The snowfall in mountains farther inland was considerably heavier, forcing the 
California Highway Patrol to convoy traffic through the Gorman area on 
Interstate 5 for about four hours. The CHP said the storm triggered numerous 
accidents in the area, and dozens of vehicles were stuck in several inches of 
ice and windblown snow. 
</P>
<P>
"It's miserable, downright miserable," said Jim Parson, a Caltrans spokesman 
based in Lebec. "We've got blowing snow and cold conditions and a number of 
cars spun out." The snowfall was expected to end early today, but forecasters 
said clearing skies would probably bring even colder temperatures -- with 
subfreezing readings predicted for many communities -- this morning and Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in the low 20s -- cold enough to cause significant damage to 
citrus and avocado crops -- were anticipated throughout the weekend in some of 
Southern California's agricultural districts. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said it will remain clear and get a little warmer -- but not much 
-- on Monday and on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
Snow dusted the foothill town of Glendora and the coastline communities of Seal 
Beach, San Clemente, Rancho Palos Verdes and the San Pedro district of Los 
Angeles about 8 a.m. Friday. The flurries melted almost immediately, but not 
before they startled residents accustomed to balmier weather. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw that it was snowing, I ran into my daughter's bedroom and woke her 
up," said Pauline White, a longtime resident of Rancho Palos Verdes. "I saw it 
snow here back in 1949, but she's only 27, and I know she'd never seen snow in 
Palos Verdes before." 
</P>
<P>
It may have been that long since there was snow in the harbor area, but it has 
been less than 14 months since snow fell on other communities in metropolitan 
Los Angeles. The last time was on Feb. 7, 1989, when up to five inches 
accumulated in the Porter Ranch, Tarzana and Granada Hills areas. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, where most of the Friday's flurries fell along the coast, a 
few more snowfall reports were reported farther inland. One was at the Joplin 
Boys Ranch, a 60-student juvenile detention facility at the edge of the 
Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Pierce, a spokeswoman for the ranch, said the heater at the ranch house 
quit about the time the snow started, forcing the boys to bundle up in 
45-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just making a little more hot chocolate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the frigid, often blustery conditions were the product of a 
huge, slow-moving low-pressure system blanketing the Western half of the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The cold air has been spilling down out of the Arctic like heavy syrup, oozing 
slowly south into the United States," said Rick Dittmann, a forecaster with 
WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. "It's been cold, and 
it's staying cold." 
</P>
<P>
The Arctic weather mass plunged temperatures to record lows for the date as it 
moved south across California. Light snow was reported in a number of Central 
California communities where it is seldom seen -- Sacramento, Monterey, Fresno, 
Madera, Bakersfield and Lompoc. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-dawn temperature readings Friday included -22 at Truckee, -14 at Alturas, 
-8 at Susanville and 0 at Quincy. It was 17 at Redding, tying the all-time 
record there, set in 1937. It was 14 at Red Bluff, setting an all-time record. 
Gusting winds drove the wind-chill factor at the Redding airport down to -26. 
</P>
<P>
It was 32 in San Francisco, breaking the record for Dec. 21 by three degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's low in Los Angeles was a relatively warm 42 degrees, but the high for 
the day was only eight degrees warmer, far below the normal high for the date 
of 67. 
</P>
<P>
And it was a lot colder than that in outlying communities. 
</P>
<P>
Friday morning's lows included 36 in Burbank, 34 in Van Nuys, 30 in Riverside, 
26 in Lancaster and Newhall and 26 in Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
This morning is expected to be even colder, with a low of about 37 at the Los 
Angeles Civic Center and readings in the 20s in some areas of the San Fernando 
and San Gabriel valleys. Today's downtown high should be about 55 degrees, with 
similar highs expected in most coastal communities. 
</P>
<P>
WeatherData meteorologist Steve Burback said the lows in the metropolitan area 
should moderate slightly on Sunday, Monday and Christmas Day, climbing slowly 
into the mid-30s and lower 40s. He said the highs should climb gradually at the 
same time, reaching the mid-60s on Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was the winter solstice -- the shortest day of the year. The season 
began officially here at 7:07 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Nancy Wride in Orange County contributed to this story.

TEACHERS DISLIKE MERIT PAY PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: THE PLAN WAS ESTABLISHED IN TENNESSEE BY EDUCATION DEPARTMENT NOMINEE. 
CRITICS LABEL IT COMPLICATED, UNREALISTIC AND TIME CONSUMING.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 17 years, Nancy Shipner has taught kindergarten in the same room at Calvin 
Donaldson Elementary in an industrial neighborhood snuggled in the shadow of 
Lookout Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, she was still earning less than $35,000, so she "jumped through the 
hoops" to qualify for a $2,000-a-year merit pay raise under Tennessee's Career 
Ladder Program, begun in 1984 by former Gov. Lamar Alexander, whom President 
Bush nominated this week to be secretary of education. 
</P>
<P>
But, like the majority of Tennessee teachers and administrators who join the 
program, Shipner did so with one hand over her nose. 
</P>
<P>
Merit pay should be much simpler -- teachers deserve more, and they should be 
paid more, Shipner argued. 
</P>
<P>
Merit pay -- arguably the attention-getting innovation that led to Alexander's 
appointment as the nation's No. 1 educator -- establishes different pay levels 
for teachers based on their performance. To admirers, it is an incentive to 
better teaching. To detractors, it is a bureaucratic disaster that destroys 
teacher morale and retards system-wide pay hikes. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over merit pay is unlikely to slow Senate approval of 
Alexander's nomination. Alexander's political and educational credentials are 
broad: As governor, he increased the number of math and science teachers and 
raised budgets to put computers in junior high schools, and, more recently, he 
has served as president of the University of Tennessee. But his appointment is 
certain to focus attention on the impact of his most far-reaching program. 
</P>
<P>
Groping for a way to keep good teachers, seven states have emulated Tennessee's 
Career Ladder Program since 1984, according to a new report by the Southern 
Regional Education Board, an Atlanta-based research organization. 
</P>
<P>
The board said that an additional 18 states have some form of teacher-incentive 
plan, including California, which has "mentor teachers," who receive extra pay 
for working with other teachers to upgrade the profession and improve 
education. 
</P>
<P>
Gale Gaines, a research associate at the board, said the mix of efforts "is 
evolving." 
</P>
<P>
"There's definitely a lot going on," but the merit pay concept is too new to 
have proven itself good or bad, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee teachers beg to differ. 
</P>
<P>
Too complicated, too time consuming, divisive, unfair and unrealistic are just 
a few of the printable adjectives teachers use to describe the plan. Even state 
education officials concede that the original program needed extensive 
overhauling to be a minimally acceptable incentive tool. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a long, hard look at the program and have made some changes," said 
Brad Hurley, assistant to the state education commissioner. "We've tried to 
simplify the process." 
</P>
<P>
But, obviously, the changes are not enough for many educators. Hurley said he 
has a cousin who teaches second grade, "and she's elected not to go through 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The program has three levels, and each pays teachers an additional $1,000 a 
year after their length of employment makes them eligible and they go through a 
series of evaluations, in-class observations and written tests. Principals, 
assistant principals and supervisors receive slightly more. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, more money can be earned for extra work, typically up to about 
$4,000. But, because this means working after school or during summer vacation, 
educators do not see this as "merit pay." 
</P>
<P>
Extra pay for extra work is "not much of a reward," said Al Mance, assistant 
executive secretary of the Tennessee Education Assn. 
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the state department of education, more than 
39,000 of the state's 50,000 teachers participate in the Career Ladder Program, 
but only about 7,000 of those are in the two upper levels. Most are 
concentrated in Level 1. 
</P>
<P>
Only about one-fourth of all educators who are eligible for the higher levels 
actually have made it to them. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying for the three levels used to take an entire semester, but now the 
process can be completed in 30 days, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
James Cunningham, a Chattanooga teacher who has taught computer science since 
1970, remains unimpressed. "I'm not in any of the ladders at all," he said. "I 
opted not to get in until they got the bugs out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Opinion surveys by the Tennessee Education Assn. consistently show that huge 
majorities of the state's teachers think the program is "neither effective nor 
fair," Mance said. The National Education Assn., the nation's largest teachers' 
union, uses similar arguments to oppose the concept. 
</P>
<P>
Conversations with teachers, union officers and principals show that those who 
participate do it for the money, but most teachers believe the program's 
negative aspects offset its financial benefit. 
</P>
<P>
For example, many teachers report that the three levels have the effect of 
separating staffs into "good" and "bad" groups, thereby straining relations and 
hurting morale. Also, they argue that it is impossible to objectively evaluate 
teaching performances with the three classroom visits that are made. 
</P>
<P>
As a measure of the conflict surrounding the evaluations, teachers in 
inner-city schools complain that their teaching styles often are judged by 
people with suburban attitudes and sensibilities. For example, they say, 
inner-city schools generally are noisier, but that does not mean an absence of 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Many educators who fail to qualify for the increases have challenged the 
system, creating a bureaucratic nightmare for administrators. Some appeals are 
years old, and those who win can be paid retroactively. "It's a mess," said one 
Chattanooga school system official. 
</P>
<P>
The program is criticized for not putting enough emphasis on developing skills. 
"Because you're good this year doesn't mean you're good forever," said Betty 
Williams, principal of Calvin Donaldson here. 
</P>
<P>
But, outside the state, many education experts give the plan high marks. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Connors, executive director of the Southern Republican Exchange, a 
Birmingham, Ala.-based research organization that has held numerous forums on 
education issues, said the plan "has to be good" if teacher unions oppose it. 
He asserted that the role of unions "is to protect the bottom group of 
teachers." 
</P>
<P>
In the nation's capital, Emily Feistritzer, president of the National Center 
for Education Information, said, "My sense is (that) the really good teachers 
like the program. They really don't like the fact that bad teachers get paid 
the same as they do." 
</P>
<P>
Around Tennessee, some say the plan was a small step toward helping teachers 
get more money, that it called attention to the state's sorry state of 
education and that it propelled Alexander into the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
As education secretary, Alexander cannot set policy for local or state school 
systems, but he can set tone. However, Alexander, who left the governor's 
office in 1987 after two terms, has not been in the forefront of the battle 
recently over merit pay. 
</P>
<P>
"I think at the time what Tennessee did was bold and was correct and was out in 
front of what most states were willing to do and that we've had some good 
results," he told the Knoxville News-Sentinel this fall, commenting about all 
aspects of education reform in the state. 
</P>
<P>
But few people around here believe Tennessee's merit pay plan could be applied 
on a national level. "That would be too massive a management problem," said 
Gary Calfee, Chattanooga's assistant superintendent for personnel, citing 
regional differences that make it difficult even to apply statewide standards 
of evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Calfee, who was heavily involved with implementing the program as the state's 
director of teacher certification from 1985 to 1989, said: "Sometimes I think 
(the program) wasn't worth it . . . . It wasn't what I would have liked it to 
be, but little in life is."

GOV. CELESTE FREEING 25 'BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME' PRISONERS

Gov. Richard F. Celeste on Friday granted clemency to 25 women prisoners who he 
said had committed crimes because they were victims of battering or other forms 
of physical or emotional abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The lame-duck governor said he reviewed 105 cases in which "battered woman 
syndrome" was suspected. 
</P>
<P>
The Ohio Supreme Court and the state Legislature in March established the 
syndrome as a defense against murder and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the inmates were serving time for murder, manslaughter and assault. 
</P>
<P>
Paperwork and other procedures probably will mean the women won't be released 
until after Christmas, Celeste said at a news conference. The governor included 
a stipulation that all of those freed must perform 200 hours of community 
service in domestic violence programs. He said each woman must serve at least 
two years before being released. Four of the 25 women have spent less than two 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Of the cases the governor reviewed, 32 were sent back to the state Parole Board 
for further review and 48 were rejected, he said.

TOP AIDS DRUG REGULATOR TO STEP DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE FDA'S DR. ELLEN COOPER ASKS FOR A JOB WITH LESS PRESSURE. EVEN 
CRITICS FEAR HER DEPARTURE WILL SLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TREATMENTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trapped in the cross-fire between scientists, drug companies and certain AIDS 
activists, Dr. Ellen Cooper, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's top AIDS 
drug regulator, has requested a transfer to a less-pressured post within the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper refused to comment on the move Friday, but friends, associates and an 
FDA spokesman confirmed her decision to step down. Many said her departure from 
her post as director of the FDA's Division of Anti-Viral Drug Products in 
Bethesda, Md., a job she has held for three years, would be a severe blow to 
attempts to rapidly develop and license effective AIDS treatments. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me: 'I've had it. I've quit,' " said Dr. Donald Abrams, deputy 
director of the AIDS Program at San Francisco General Hospital and a member of 
the FDA's anti-viral drug advisory committee. "I told her to take a week off. 
She said she needed a lot more than a week." 
</P>
<P>
Abrams called Cooper's decision "a real loss," adding: "Anybody who takes that 
position is going to be under a lot of pressure and scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said Cooper had asked to be relieved of her post in a 
letter delivered Thursday to Dr. Carl Peck, director of the FDA's Center for 
Drug Evaluation and Research. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper and the FDA had come under sharp attack this week from Martin Delaney, 
executive director of the San Francisco-based AIDS activist group Project 
Inform, for her handling of a Project Inform-led initiative to expedite the 
licensing of the experimental AIDS medications DDI and DDC. Some scientists at 
the National Institutes of Health also have privately criticized Cooper's 
handling of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
But many AIDS activists, including some who have crossed swords with Cooper in 
the past, came to her defense as word of her decision circulated. In addition, 
they flooded her office with phone calls asking her to stay on. 
</P>
<P>
"We are heavily lobbying her to reconsider," said Mark Harrington, a member of 
the treatment and data committee of ACT UP/New York, a gay activist group. 
"There is no one who could replace her. She has evolved so much over the past 
two years. Her departure would be a huge disaster for AIDS drug development." 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent three years developing a working relationship with her," said 
David Barr, assistant director of public policy for Gay Men's Health Crisis, a 
New York AIDS services organization. "This would slow everything down 
terribly." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, a 40-year-old pediatrician and mother of four, has a bachelor's degree 
in political science from Swarthmore College, a medical degree from Case 
Western Reserve University and a master's degree in public health from Johns 
Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1987 interview, she acknowledged that attacks by AIDS activists "bother me 
on a certain level" but added: "I understand the human need to have a scapegoat 
in frustrating circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
The latest attack on Cooper and the FDA was made by Project Inform's Delaney, 
who on Wednesday accused the agency of taking "an extremely hard line" on 
expedited licensing of DDI, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., and DDC, made by 
Hoffman-LaRoche Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"If the FDA's current views prevail, there will be no new AIDS drugs for a long 
time to come," Delaney warned. 
</P>
<P>
But Harrington said the battle over licensing DDI and DDC "is a stupid 
skirmish," especially because both drugs are already available through 
compassionate-use programs to certain patients who fail to benefit from AZT, 
the leading drug available to AIDS patients.

17 U.S. SAILORS DROWN AS BOAT CAPSIZES

<P>
A rented boat capsized in rough Mediterranean waters early today while ferrying 
about 100 U.S. sailors back from shore leave to the aircraft carrier Saratoga. 
Police said they recovered 17 bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Before the latest police report, an American official confirmed 11 deaths and 
said nine men were still missing. 
</P>
<P>
The police report came after divers began searching the hull of the sunken 
ferry boat for victims. 
</P>
<P>
At least 33 sailors were taken to Israeli hospitals for treatment, an Israeli 
doctor said. Police gunboats, helicopters and rescue vessels, which plucked 
another 42 seamen from the water and took them on to the Saratoga, continued 
scouring Haifa Bay before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1,650 American servicemen from the Saratoga and at least three 
escort ships disembarked at Haifa on Friday for Christmas leave. 
</P>
<P>
The Saratoga, part of the U.S. Sixth Fleet based in Italy, is stationed in the 
eastern Mediterranean as a battle group included in the multinational force 
opposing Iraq. The carrier has a crew of about 6,200. 
</P>
<P>
According to sailors at the scene and a U.S. official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, the boat was not a U.S. naval vessel as originally reported by 
authorities, but was a privately rented Israeli launch. 
</P>
<P>
"It was overloaded at the rear and because of the high seas, water started 
coming over the stern," said one young sailor, who spoke on condition he not be 
identified. "Once it started coming over, it capsized very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
An official at the American Embassy in Tel Aviv, also speaking on condition of 
anonymity, reported 11 dead and nine missing before the police report later in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
Kip Burke, commander, Sixth Fleet Staff, based in Gaeta, Italy, said an 
estimated 100 sailors were aboard the boat. He said an investigation had begun 
into the accident but he was uncertain how far off shore the boat was when the 
1:30 a.m. incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman said the identities of the dead sailors 
were not immediately released.

ISRAEL SHARPLY HIKES IMMIGRATION OF SOVIET JEWS

<P>
Israel announced Friday that it is using every available plane and even 
allowing flights on the Jewish Sabbath to bring in a new wave of Soviet Jews 
fearing political turmoil in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
The daily rate of Soviet Jewish immigration to Israel -- already at its highest 
level in decades -- has nearly doubled in the last three days, from about 800 
to more than 1,500, officials said. Between Thursday and Sunday, they expect 
arrivals to total about 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt the growing wave is, in part, a response to the worsening situation 
in the Soviet Union and the debilitation of the government," said Simcha 
Dinitz, chairman of the Jewish Agency, which oversees immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Apprehensions grew after Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze 
resigned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Dinitz also cited the continuing economic crisis in the Soviet Union and 
improved transportation arrangements as reasons behind the latest rush of 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"This wonderful operation is possible because many, almost 50%, are arriving to 
the transit points overland by train, by bus, by taxi and also by bicycle," 
Dinitz told Israel television. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said many Soviet Jews have been holding exit visas for two to three 
months waiting for plane tickets but chose to come any way they could this week 
because of the growing tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Several Soviet Jews arriving Friday at Ben Gurion International Airport said 
they fear that the liberal emigration policies of Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev may soon end. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Minister Moshe Katzav gave special permission to maintain the 
airlift over the weekend. Flying violates the Jewish Sabbath, the biblical day 
of rest that runs from sundown Friday until sundown Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Three El Al planes headed Friday night for transit points in Warsaw, Bucharest 
and Budapest and were to return early Saturday with 750 Soviet immigrants. Four 
more planes are scheduled to fly today to the European points to pick up more 
immigrants, El Al spokesman Nachum Kleinman said. 
</P>
<P>
At least 160,000 Soviet Jews have arrived in Israel in 1990.

U.S. FORCES PUT ON SPECIAL ALERT AS ISRAEL TEST-LAUNCHES MISSILE 
</P>

<P>
American forces in Saudi Arabia were placed on "alarm red" status Friday, 
indicating possible enemy attack, as Israel test-launched a missile, and there 
were reports of an Iraqi missile flight test, too. 
</P>
<P>
The missile activity heightened tensions in the region and briefly stirred 
confusion among American troops. Although U.S. commanders had learned a short 
time in advance that an Israeli launch was imminent, there was uncertainty 
about the missile's origin when it occurred, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at one air base in eastern Saudi Arabia said the special alert status 
was in effect there for about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's scare was at least the second this month. On Dec. 2, an Iraqi test of 
three medium-range missiles caught U.S. officials by surprise and prompted some 
of them to fear that war was about to erupt. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli flight test occurred Friday afternoon and involved a Jericho-2 
missile, designed to reach targets more than 900 miles away. The last Israeli 
test of this missile occurred in September, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be just a test, or it could be an Israeli demonstration to show Iraq 
that they have the means" to retaliate against an attack on Israel, said one 
Pentagon source. "They don't write a lot of inscriptions. You can interpret it 
any way you want." 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no official government comment on the test, the United 
States has encouraged Israel to maintain a low profile to avoid inflaming the 
Persian Gulf crisis or antagonizing Washington's Arab allies. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Israeli test, one U.S. government source said Iraq also tested a 
Soviet-made Scud missile Friday, but this could not be confirmed with other 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The United States had been "looking carefully" at the prospect of an Iraqi 
missile test Friday, said one source. "We were pretty sure this one was going 
to be a test. We were a lot surer this time than we were last time." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's missiles are considered a particularly threatening part of that nation's 
offensive arsenal, with some experts believing that the Scuds could be used to 
deliver chemical weapons and could effectively target Saudi oil installations. 
The tests underscore the Baghdad government's threatening rhetoric in advance 
of the Jan. 15 U.N deadline for withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
One of the sites at which the Israeli launch was detected was an air base in 
eastern Saudi Arabia, where Air Force A-10 tank-killing jets are based. Base 
officials said the alert ended shortly before Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and 
Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, arrived for a 
troop visit. 
</P>
<P>
The missile launching also was reported by a Coast Guard radio crewman on a 
ship in the Persian Gulf, where sailors initially thought it was an Iraqi Scud. 
</P>
<P>
One senior Administration official said the order for the alert status 
reflected not so much an intelligence failure as cautious response to a highly 
volatile situation. 
</P>
<P>
"You want them to be uncertain, to be conservative in their action," the 
official said. "That's the way you want the system to respond."

WHO'LL SUCCEED SHEVARDNADZE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The next Soviet foreign minister will face a world different from the one 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze took on five years ago, but the possible candidates are 
all dedicated followers of the policy their predecessor set down. 
</P>
<P>
 Most work in the Foreign Ministry and have experience as diplomats or 
scholars, the kind of training Shevardnadze lacked when Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
appointed him in 1985 to take over for Andrei A. Gromyko. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Shevardnadze, a crusader for change, the next foreign minister will need 
to cultivate the Soviet Union's new role as a self-declared mediator, rather 
than a supporter of revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The new foreign minister likely will have less financial and military aid to 
use as a tool in his work, with his government facing a flagging economy. And 
he will need a knowledge of international economics, with his leaders expecting 
more materially from its foreign friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at some of those considered candidates for the job: 
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny M. Primakov (pronounced Pree-mah-kof'), the first possible candidate 
mentioned in the Soviet press after Shevardnadze's resignation, is a 
61-year-old former professor known most recently for his shuttle diplomacy to 
Iraq looking for a solution in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
His effort failed after several meetings with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, 
reported to be a longtime friend. But still it heightened his status as a savvy 
envoy who at least tried to deal with Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Primakov has been a director of the prestigious Institute for World Economy and 
International Relations. An expert on the Middle and Far East, as well as 
having a doctorate in economics, Primakov helped devise the "new thinking" 
foreign policy that Shevardnadze was implementing. 
</P>
<P>
Primakov recently was criticized in the Soviet press for being among officials 
who received new, state-owned apartments without the usual waiting period. But 
the news didn't seem to tarnish his image; he also was mentioned as a possible 
candidate for the proposed new post of vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Valentin M. Falin (Fah'-lin), 64, became chief of the Communist Party's 
international department in 1988, before the party's credibility plummeted and 
the job lost some influence over foreign policies. 
</P>
<P>
Falin is considered a master diplomat and the leading Soviet expert on Western 
Europe. He rose through the Foreign Ministry's European departments and served 
as a Soviet attache in Austria and ambassador to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
He was an adviser to Gromyko in 1965, a national legislator on the foreign 
affairs committee, a member of the government daily Izvestia's editorial board, 
and a member of the party's policy-making Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir F. Petrovsky (Peh-trof'-skee), a deputy foreign minister since 1986, 
has seen his stock rise since returning from Iraq last month to seek a solution 
to the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old diplomat was in Baghdad while Moscow began dropping its 
cautionary tone and threatening to support force against Iraq if Hussein didn't 
pull out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
He began his foreign service career as an English translator at the United 
Nations, later rising under Gromyko. He later became chief of the Foreign 
Ministry's U.S. department, then head of the ministry's section that deals with 
international organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Yuli M. Vorontsov (Voh-rahn'-tsof), 61, a rare generalist in Soviet diplomacy, 
worked in the United States, India and France before being sent as a 
trouble-shooting ambassador to Afghanistan during the Soviet pullout in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
His experience includes meeting secretly in 1985 with Israel's ambassador in 
France to discuss restoration of ties, defending Soviet human rights policies 
at a conference in 1977, and leading disarmament talks in 1985 over U.S. and 
Soviet nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
He later was brought back to Moscow and made first deputy foreign minister, 
solidifying his place in a new generation of flexible, innovative diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander A. Bessmertnykh (Bes-mairt-nikh'), 57, an expert on U.S.-Soviet 
relations, was made Soviet ambassador to the United States in April in a 
sweeping appointment of new foreign service officers. 
</P>
<P>
He had served in the Soviet Embassy in Washington for 13 years before returning 
to Moscow in 1983, where he was a deputy foreign minister responsible for the 
United Nations and North America. He later rose to become one of three first 
deputy foreign ministers.

IMF, WORLD BANK URGE SOVIET MARKET REFORMS;

<P>
ECONOMY: WITHOUT A SHARP BREAK FROM CENTRAL CONTROL, THE GROUPS SAY, WESTERN 
AID WILL BE OF LITTLE HELP.

<P>
The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank warned Friday that the 
Soviet Union must make a sharp break with centralized control and move quickly 
to a market economy if it is to pull out of its accelerating downward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
They also cautioned that, except in certain limited circumstances, given the 
shattered state of the country's distribution and economic systems, large-scale 
Western aid -- including emergency food and humanitarian assistance -- would be 
of little use in reviving the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
The assessments, the result of the first formal study of the Soviet economy by 
the groups, concluded that the economy has now "broken down," with both 
employment and the nation's output of goods and services plunging in a 
near-free fall. 
</P>
<P>
Under such conditions, a large dose of Western assistance would be wasted, the 
document said. 
</P>
<P>
A separate report by the Economic Community in Europe supported many of the 
conclusions reached by the IMF and the World Bank, terming the Soviet Union an 
economic basket case whose condition has only been made worse by halfway 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union is at a critical juncture," the EC study said. "The 
government is committed to fundamental reform, but it has not yet taken the 
process far enough to make that reform irreversible." 
</P>
<P>
Both studies thus implicitly criticized the direction of economic and domestic 
policy under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has sought to chart his 
internal reforms down a middle path between traditional communism and 
free-market capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
But the studies found that Gorbachev's efforts to appease hard-liners within 
the Communist Party by pushing for a compromise between Western capitalism and 
Soviet-style Marxism-Leninism have led to a nightmarish condition, in which 
neither structure can function. 
</P>
<P>
"The traditional centrally planned system has largely collapsed, but has not 
been replaced by a functioning market system," the IMF-World Bank study 
declared. "Ideally, a path of gradual reform could be laid out that would 
minimize economic disturbance," the study said. But, it added, "we know of no 
such path." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the criticism, the reports were at least somewhat sympathetic to 
Gorbachev's current position. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Soviet) authorities face an enormous task, involving reforms of the 
legal, financial and trade systems, and also of vital sectors of the economy," 
the IMF-World Bank study said. "These changes cannot be made in a matter of 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"But," it added, "the imperative is to make sufficient progress at the 
beginning so that reform is seen as an irreversible break with the past and the 
process gains an unstoppable momentum." 
</P>
<P>
The grim reports were made public against a backdrop of increasing economic and 
political instability in the Soviet Union, just a day after the resignation of 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. He warned Thursday that there 
is an increasing threat that the current instability could lead to a 
dictatorship imposed to deal with the nation's state of near-collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Perversely, the Soviet oil industry, once one of the bright spots of the 
nation's economy, is actually decreasing its production, despite the increase 
in oil prices brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis -- because domestic 
economic chaos has led to a sharp falloff in investment. 
</P>
<P>
But the IMF and World Bank warned that the problems will not be rapidly solved 
by a quick conversion to a market economy. In fact, they cautioned, the 
transition will be an extraordinarily painful one, with no guarantee of 
success. 
</P>
<P>
After the shift to a market economy and an end to government control over 
prices, the pain would first come from hyper-inflation, the studies warned. 
</P>
<P>
With consumer goods in short supply and paper money in abundance, economists 
fear that rampant inflation will take over, as consumers bid up the newly 
liberated prices with hoarded rubles. 
</P>
<P>
Now, economists are trying to gauge just how bad that problem could become by 
measuring "repressed inflation" -- how fast prices would rise if there were 
enough goods for consumers to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the pain from the quick transition would be far less damaging than what 
the Soviets will experience if they defer reform, the studies concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"The necessary economic reform program cannot be implemented without an initial 
decline in output and employment, but delays in implementation would lead to an 
even larger and longer decline," the IMF-World Bank study said.

Retiring Gov. George Deukmejian on Friday appointed Jesse Huff, his state 
director of finance since 1984, to a $90,852-a-year post on the newly created 
Integrated Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
The job is one of the choicest plums in state government and carries a 
five-year term for Huff, whose appointment is not subject to confirmation by 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Huff, 47, was picked by Deukmejian from relative obscurity as a Republican 
staffer in the Legislature and made chief deputy director of finance in 1983. 
He was promoted to director the next year after the Senate refused to confirm 
Michael Franchetti, a longtime Deukmejian associate. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's second term as governor, and Huff's job as finance director, end 
on Jan. 7, when Gov.-elect Pete Wilson will be sworn in.

WILSON ASKS FORESTRY BOARD TO DENY BID TO LOG ACRES OF ANCIENT REDWOODS

<P>
Gov.-elect Pete Wilson has written a letter urging the state Board of Forestry 
to reject a timber company proposal to cut down parts of one of the last 
privately owned ancient redwood forests. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson sided with conservationists against plans by Pacific Lumber Co. to log 
an initial 564 acres of the 3,000-acre Headwaters Forest in Humboldt County. 
</P>
<P>
The company's plan was denied by state Director of Forestry Harold Walt but the 
board, which meets Jan. 9, can override his decision. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the board dated Friday, Wilson said Pacific's logging plans 
violate a legal requirement that the company mitigate adverse environmental 
impacts caused by its cutting operations. 
</P>
<P>
"I am therefore writing to urge you . . . to uphold the denial," Wilson said. " 
. . . As governor, I will work to preserve additional old-growth redwoods in 
California's north coast, including protection of an ecologically significant 
portion of the Headwaters Forest." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson will take office as governor Jan. 7, two days before the board, made up 
of appointees of outgoing Gov. George Deukmejian, is scheduled to tackle the 
issue. Both as governor and governor-elect, Wilson can try to persuade -- but 
cannot force -- the board to act according to his will.

WOMAN FREED IN MISTAKEN ABDUCTION SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Woodland Hills mother was abducted at gunpoint and held captive for 28 hours 
before her kidnapers realized they had the wrong woman and released her 
unharmed, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspects were very apologetic," Los Angeles Police Lt. Fred Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
"They told the victim, 'We got the wrong house. You have nothing to worry about 
and we will not bother you any more.' " 
</P>
<P>
No arrests have been made and the case remains under investigation, said Nixon, 
a department spokesman. An officer assigned to the case, Lt. Ron Lewis, refused 
to release the identity of the victim or any details about her ordeal, beyond 
those provided in a written release. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, two men took a United Parcel Service driver hostage 
Tuesday, commandeering his truck in the 22900 block of Ventura Boulevard in 
Woodland Hills. They forced the driver at gunpoint to take them to a house in 
the area and pretend he was making a delivery there. 
</P>
<P>
When the victim answered the door, the suspects forced their way inside. They 
apparently hoped to find the woman's husband and told the victim that he owed 
someone $35,000 that they wanted to collect, the police report says. 
</P>
<P>
The UPS truck driver, whom police also would not identify, escaped. The 
kidnapers forced the woman, described as in her 30s, to drive them away in her 
van, leaving behind two young children. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, the woman was blindfolded and tied up, placed in the trunk of 
another vehicle and driven to an unknown location. 
</P>
<P>
She was released Wednesday, about 28 hours later, in Playa del Rey, police 
said. Apparently the suspects realized she was the wrong woman after a ransom 
demand was made to her businessman husband.

TITLE CAN BE PENALTY FOR UNLV; 
</P>
<P>
ENFORCEMENT: SCHOOL ALSO MIGHT LOSE $1 MILLION IN TV REVENUE AS A RESULT OF 
LATEST INQUIRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The University of Nevada Las Vegas could be forced to relinquish the NCAA 
basketball title it won last spring as well as nearly $1 million in NCAA 
tournament revenue as a result of violations alleged by the NCAA in the Lloyd 
Daniels case. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV has been charged with rules violations in 29 areas in a letter of official 
inquiry from the NCAA that was delivered to the school Tuesday and made public 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the version of the letter released publicly did not include names or 
identifying characteristics of individuals, most of the alleged violations 
match those outlined in a 1987 series by Newsday, a Long Island newspaper, 
describing UNLV's recruitment of Daniels, a former New York high school star 
who never played for the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious allegation levied against UNLV is the charge that the school 
did not exercise proper institutional control over the basketball program in 
three instances, including the recruitment of Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
But there were other charges as well, and because of the possible involvement 
of an athlete who played in UNLV's victory over Duke in last season's NCAA 
championship game, UNLV could be required to give up its title as well as the 
nearly $1 million it netted by reaching the Final Four -- a penalty that one 
UNLV official called "the worst-case scenario." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has alleged that two UNLV recruits, before their enrollment at the 
school, received academic tutoring at no cost to them from a member of the UNLV 
athletic department academic services staff. That is a violation of NCAA 
recruiting rules. 
</P>
<P>
The players involved in the tutoring allegation are Daniels and Barry Young, a 
reserve forward who played for the Rebels during the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
In UNLV's 103-73 victory over Duke in last season's championship game, Young 
played 12 minutes and scored five points. 
</P>
<P>
According to NCAA sanctioning guidelines for major rules violations, if the 
NCAA Committee on Infractions finds that an athlete who was improperly 
recruited or who received improper benefits competed in an NCAA championship 
event, the committee can require the athlete's school to return 90% of its 
share of the receipts from the event and vacate its position in the event's 
final record. 
</P>
<P>
Should it consider the tutoring allegation involving Young both valid and 
significant, the committee could impose those sanctions on UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV has 60 days to respond to the letter of inquiry, and the committee is 
expected to rule on the case sometime in the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
While declining to discuss any allegations contained in the letter 
specifically, Dennis Finfrock, UNLV's interim athletic director, said Friday 
that losing the title and the tournament revenue would be the harshest blow the 
NCAA could deal the school. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be the worst-case scenario of everything that could come out of 
this," he said. "You can talk about two years' probation or something, but 
nothing would compare to (losing the title and the money)." 
</P>
<P>
Young, who sat out the 1987-88 season under the NCAA's Proposition 48 entrance 
standards and has one year of eligibility remaining, is sitting out the current 
season as an "academic redshirt," according to the UNLV sports information 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the infractions cases in which schools have lost NCAA tournament 
revenue and been removed from tournament records have involved athletes who 
received improper benefits after their enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
However, the committee ruled in 1985 that the University of Georgia had to 
return 90% of the $254,000 its basketball team netted from the '85 tournament 
and that the school's participation in the tournament had to be vacated as a 
result of recruiting violations involving Cedric Henderson, a center who played 
in both of the Bulldogs' tournament games that year. 
</P>
<P>
The committee found that Georgia coaches had provided local automobile 
transportation for Henderson and his friends on three occasions during his 
recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
In the UNLV case, the NCAA alleges that an athletic department academic adviser 
-- identified by sources as Shelley Fischer -- provided academic counseling and 
tutoring for Young in the summer of 1987, when Young, who is from Ellicott, 
Md., was in Las Vegas before his enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA alleges that Young received two-hour tutoring sessions from Fischer 
two or three times a week during a six-week period that summer in the academic 
counseling area of the Thomas and Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA also alleges that, at the end of the summer, Fischer submitted a 
letter on Young's behalf to the UNLV admissions committee describing the 
tutoring in an effort to help Young be admitted to the university under its 
alternative criteria admissions program. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the NCAA alleges that other members of the UNLV athletic 
department staff knew of the tutoring that was provided for Young and Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
Young and Fischer are two of four individuals named by the NCAA in the letter 
as having allegedly provided NCAA investigators with false and misleading 
information. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported in July that Fischer had been reassigned -- to a position in 
UNLV's alumni office -- for undisclosed reasons relating to the NCAA's inquiry.

DUANE COOPER GIVES USC A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: AFTER SITTING OUT A SEASON WITH AN INJURY, THE GUARD SAYS HE SEES 
GAME LIKE A COACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Duane Cooper dreamed of playing football at USC. He idolized tailback Charles 
White and hoped to win the Heisman Trophy, as White had in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper made it to USC and he even wears White's number, 12, but he'll never be 
a Heisman winner, simply because he switched from football to basketball at 
Lakewood High, where he was an all-state guard. 
</P>
<P>
"Football became easy," Cooper said. "I didn't have to work in football, but I 
have to work in basketball. It's more of a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper has a new goal -- helping the Trojans reach the NCAA tournament for the 
first time since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Now my goal is to go to the NCAA playoffs and go to the Final Four," Cooper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Off to its best start in 15 years, USC (5-1), which plays Augusta of Georgia 
today at the Sports Arena, has won four in a row since Cooper replaced senior 
forward Calvin Banks as a starter and the Trojans went to a three-guard 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"People used to laugh at us," Cooper said. "I think they're beginning to 
respect us, but we've only chipped the iceberg. We can get a whole lot better. 
We don't want a year like we had two years ago when we started off good (4-0) 
and finished poorly (10-22). I won't let us get complacent." 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-1 redshirt junior, Cooper started 19 games at point guard in 1988-89, 
averaging 4.1 points and 2.7 assists. But he missed last season after suffering 
a stress fracture in his right foot a week before the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper wore a cast for eight weeks, then was cleared to practice. But after 
practicing for only eight days, his foot snapped, right where the crack had 
been. Doctors inserted a screw during an operation and Cooper wore another cast 
for 2 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
He went to every home game, though, sitting behind Coach George Raveling, who 
said that it helped Cooper view games from a coach's perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"By sitting out last year I'm able to see things that Coach sees," Cooper said. 
"I'd see him get mad at the other guards and I'd say to myself, 'What would I 
have done?' I know what he wants and I can transfer information from him to the 
other players and I can tell him things that I think we should be doing." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper also helped Raveling in recruiting, talking with potential recruits 
during campus visits. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably the most unusual kid I've ever coached," Raveling said. "Not 
many guys would go out and recruit players when they know they're going to have 
to compete against them for playing time. He's our best recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids say they'd do anything to win, but Duane would. It wouldn't make any 
difference to him if he never shot in a game as long as we won." 
</P>
<P>
When Cooper returned this season, he was unable to win his old job from Robert 
Pack, who had replaced him in the starting lineup. But after the Trojans 
collapsed in the final 12 1/2 minutes of a 72-59 loss at Maryland, Raveling 
revised the lineup, inserting Cooper in place of Banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Cooper has been the catalyst in our improvement," Raveling said. "I felt that 
the Maryland game was going to be the turning point of the season because it 
forced us to do something different. And that was to go to a three-guard 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans have defeated Miami, San Diego State, Colorado State and Notre Dame 
since Cooper became a starter. He has averaged 6.5 points, 6.3 assists and 4.3 
rebounds in that span. He had seven points, a career-high six rebounds and a 
career-high eight assists in last week's 105-95 victory at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
USC's defense also has improved since Cooper became a starter. Opposing 
starting guards have made only 37.8% of their shots since the change and the 
Trojans have forced 14.3 turnovers a game. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's presence in the lineup has also helped free Pack. After averaging 10 
points in USC's first two games, Pack has since averaged 17.5. 
</P>
<P>
"Coop adds a lot to the lineup," Pack said. "With him in the lineup we can run 
more because other teams can't key on me getting the outlet pass. Plus, we're 
able to pressure on defense with three guards." 
</P>
<P>
Although Cooper and Pack are both point guards, there has been no conflict 
between them in the three-guard offense, which also features shooting guard 
Harold Miner. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all willing to accept the roles we have," Cooper said. "Robert's a point 
guard, but he's not selfish. If I get the ball then he can run the lane and if 
he gets the ball I can run the lane. It creates a wide-open game and gives us 
more speed and it creates a lot of one-on-ones for Harold." 
</P>
<P>
Miner, who averaged 25.5 points in USC's first two games, scored 31 points 
against Miami in Cooper's first game as a starter and he had a season-high 35 
against Notre Dame.

RAIDERS: MINNESOTA, 19-2 IN THE METRODOME SINCE 1988, WILL TRY TO STYMIE L.A. 
TODAY.

<P>
Clinching a playoff spot was last week's news for the Raiders, who enter 
Minnesota's temple-of-doom dome today hoping to secure some vacation time 
before postseason assignments. 
</P>
<P>
The signposts are clear: The Raiders, at 10-4, have a magic number of two to 
clinch the AFC West, meaning any combination of Raider victories and Kansas 
City losses totaling two would give the Raiders the division title and a 
first-round bye. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders can make it simple by defeating the Vikings today in the Metrodome 
and San Diego at the Coliseum Dec. 30. If they split, or lose both, they need 
help from the Chiefs, who will close the season on the road against the 
Chargers Sunday and the Chicago Bears next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders remain the only team to win the Super Bowl as a wild-card entrant, 
in 1980. That was nice . . . once. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't win the division, you've got to play three games before the big 
game," Raider Coach Art Shell said Friday. "We'd rather have the bye. They 
understand that." 
</P>
<P>
You figure the Vikings (6-8) are easy marks without 1989's defensive player of 
the year, Keith Millard? You've seen the standings. You come in, maybe pick up 
a new Christmas bobsled for Herschel Walker, take care of business, then get to 
the airport and de-ice the wings. If there weren't Rams in the world, the 
Vikings would be the busts of 1990. Big talent, big dreams and big trades have 
produced nothing but big problems. 
</P>
<P>
The front office claimed to be making a Super Bowl push in 1989, selling its 
future to Dallas -- five players, eight draft choices -- for the rights to 
tailback Walker, who gained 148 yards in his debut Oct. 15, 1989, and hasn't 
cracked 100 yards in any game since. Walker thought he was misused and cried in 
a national magazine story that was headlined: "I Am Not a Dog." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Cowboys, who have yet to cash in their Walker draft prizes, are a 
game ahead of the Vikings for the final NFC wild-card spot. 
</P>
<P>
Where did it go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
For starters, Minnesota lost Millard, its star defensive tackle, in Week 4. The 
Vikings skidded to 1-6. In the meantime, the team's general manager, Mike Lynn, 
accepted another job with a spring football league, leaving his legacy -- or 
his lunacy. 
</P>
<P>
The coach, Jerry Burns, will turn 64 Jan. 24. How long can he take it? One more 
season, apparently. Burns announced this week that he wanted to fulfill the 
last year of his contract, if nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
Burns was energized by a five-game winning streak that put the Vikings at 6-6, 
but they have lost two in a row. Their starting quarterback, Wade Wilson, has 
recently returned to the lineup after a thumb injury. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Wilson wondered what happened to his team's season. Something has 
been missing. 
</P>
<P>
"The heartfelt emotion," he said. "Not the shallow rah-rah stuff you get before 
the game, just the emotion, the desire to find a way to get it done somehow. 
You just don't feel that over the last year. . . . With all the problems we've 
had off the field, the DUI situations (involving several players over the 
years), the management, the ownership, it's just been something almost every 
week. It's kind of a cop-out word, but to say we lack focus sometimes, it could 
be a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings have long been considered one of the most talented teams in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
"The talent's there, no question," Wilson said. "But I think the chemistry for 
winning goes beyond just pure physical talent. You have to have some 
intangibles, some leadership and a lot of desire." 
</P>
<P>
For the Raiders, this game might appear the equivalent of a fat fastball down 
the middle, except that, turmoil and all, the Vikings are nearly impossible to 
beat in the Metrodome. Since Nov. 24, 1988, the Vikings are 19-2 at home and 
1-15 on the road. Some suggest the record reflects Burns' aversion to the cold, 
that he takes his team inside to practice in a cozy bubble-top facility at the 
first sign of wind-chill. 
</P>
<P>
Burns doesn't know the reason. Art Shell offered an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"Look around," he said. "Most teams play well at home." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are trying to take care of a nasty little streak of their own. 
Starting in 1986, they have lost the last two games of the season for four 
consecutive years. Not the kind of momentum the team is looking to extend. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
It's a longshot, but the Vikings can clinch the last wild-card spot at 8-8 if 
they win their last two games, Dallas loses its last two, and Green Bay and 
Tampa Bay lose one game each. . . . Despite their problems, the Vikings enter 
today's game with the NFL's top-rated pass defense. . . . Herschel Walker does 
not have a 100-yard rushing game this season, but he has gained 654 yards in 
160 carries, an average of 4.1 yards . . . . Four Vikings were named to the NFC 
Pro Bowl team this week: guard Randall McDaniel, tight end Steve Jordan, 
defensive end Chris Doleman and safety Joey Browner.

TALE OF BIRDS OF PREY AND THEIR PREDATORS; 
</P>
<P>
PEREGRINE FALCONS ENDANGERED, AND SOME SAY HIGHLY MARKETABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Early this year a Montana forest ranger found an ailing bald eagle by the side 
of a road and took it to Jeff McPartlin, who was known for rehabilitating 
raptors -- birds of prey. 
</P>
<P>
The eagle had ingested some poison, but McPartlin nursed it and two weeks later 
released it at the headquarters of the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and 
Parks along the Missouri River near Great Falls. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Adams, an Audubon Society official, said she once took an injured 
great horned owl to McPartlin. 
</P>
<P>
"It took Jeff about 15 minutes to figure out its hips were dislocated," Adams 
said. "He popped them back into place, and it was released within 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
That view of McPartlin as a benefactor of birds conflicts sharply with opinions 
of some members of the North American Falconers Assn. (NAFA), who make up about 
two-thirds of the 2,700 falconers -- people who hunt with birds -- in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
One, Steve Sherrod of Bartlesville, Okla., called McPartlin "a traitor to the 
very sport we all love." 
</P>
<P>
That was after McPartlin was kicked out of NAFA for working undercover for the 
United States Fish and Wildlife Service in "Operation Falcon," which exposed 
illegal trafficking of birds several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
McPartlin also raises peregrine falcons, a species whose days seemed numbered 
in 1969 when there were 60 nesting pairs in the contiguous 48 states and the 
Fish and Wildlife Service listed it as endangered -- one step from nature's 
Death Row, a victim of the pesticide DDT. 
</P>
<P>
No longer, it was feared, would people marvel at the high-speed dives and 
mid-air kills of nature's swiftest creature -- a spectacle older than 
Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
Through the efforts of biologists, countless volunteers and financial 
contributors -- all revolving around the Peregrine Fund Inc. of Boise, Ida. -- 
more than 3,000 peregrines have been bred in captivity to restock the wild, and 
now experts see what signals a major comeback in the annals of conservation. 
</P>
<P>
But a close look at the shadowy community of falconry also reveals a dark side, 
with links to the Middle East, where falconry traditions run hot and deep. Even 
in the United States, falconers guard their turf against rigid government 
regulation with the tenacity of their birds. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Critics claim that the Peregrine Fund's leaders got the bird listed as 
endangered to acquire a corner on the market and now want peregrine falcons 
down-listed to cash in. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fish and Wildlife Service documents show that the Peregrine Fund, although 
supported by public funds and purporting to operate within the framework of the 
Endangered Species Act, has (a) given birds to its directors, (b) exchanged 
birds with one breeder who sells birds to Arabs and who was once convicted of 
illegal trafficking and (c) received donations from Arabs for assisting in 
their breeding programs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One Peregrine Fund director, Frank Bond, who recently ran for governor of 
New Mexico and lost, used his influence to retrieve one of his own unregistered 
-- i.e., illegal -- birds that was seized in Operation Falcon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Outside biologists and breeders question the Peregrine Fund's motives and 
methods, particularly the practice of replacing the extinct eastern peregrine 
with a stronger hybrid that would be more marketable, should the peregrine come 
off the endangered list. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hari Har Singh Khalsa, a falcon breeder in New Mexico, continues to make 
accusations. The Peregrine Fund's defenders say he is motivated by greed. 
Khalsa admits he is "ruthless." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The North American Falconers Assn. attempts to control publicity about its 
activities to the extent of trying to kill articles it says will be critical. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Before the FWS hired McPartlin to go undercover, it knew he had once been 
convicted on an illegal falcon-trafficking violation. 
</P>
<P>
In the falconry game, nobody seems to come off clean. 
</P>
<P>
If this seems as if it's a lot of fuss over a bird smaller than a chicken, 
consider that the peregrine is a special bird with a special fascination, and 
implications about abuse of the Endangered Species Act are serious. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice LeFranc, who specializes in birds of prey for the endangered species 
group of the private and nonprofit National Wildlife Federation, says talk of 
down-listing the peregrine from endangered is premature. 
</P>
<P>
Others say there are plenty of peregrines, which have been protected by law 
since Congress passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Without the endangered listing, U.S. falconers could trap peregrines in the 
wild for their personal use. As it is, only captive-bred birds from breeding 
stock in captivity before 1977 may be used, and there are strict regulations on 
their sale under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). 
</P>
<P>
The Fish and Wildlife Service has appointed a recovery team of five experts to 
study the comeback and make a recommendation. Le-Franc says the service is 
lowering its original recovery goals toward an arbitrary judgment that will 
make itself look good. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fish and Wildlife Service seems to be in a hurry to look at several 
species to down-list," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Peregrine Fund was started in 1970 by Dr. Tom Cade when he was teaching 
ornithology at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. The project to restore the 
sub-species Falco peregrinus was later expanded to facilities at Ft. Collins, 
Colo., and Santa Cruz, where Brian Walton heads the Predatory Bird Research 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, the Ft. Collins facility moved into permanent headquarters at 
Boise as the World Center for Birds of Prey. More than 3,000 of the birds have 
been bred in captivity and released in cities or in the wild of half the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the total number of birds we have released, in cities or on cliffs or 
towers, about 83% have made it to independence," says Bill Burnham, president 
of the Peregrine Fund and director of the center. 
</P>
<P>
The level of success has been about the same, city or country. To peregrines, a 
skyscraper is just a man-made cliff, the street below a canyon, and if there is 
a plentiful food supply of pigeons and there are no great horned owls or golden 
eagles -- peregrines' natural predators -- so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
DDT and its residue, metabolite DDE, that experts say killed birds outright or 
caused eggshells so thin they would shatter in nests, have long been banished 
in the United States. The birds are reproducing in the wild again. Some say the 
crisis is passing. 
</P>
<P>
And some falconers claim there never was a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ARABS AND ADVERSARIES 
</P>
<P>
McPartlin was the kingpin of the Fish and Wildlife Service's "Operation Falcon" 
sting that climaxed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The sweep led to 68 convictions in the United States, most on misdemeanor 
charges, and resulted in three years of jail time, $501,071 in fines, 1,615 
hours of community service and 78 1/2 years probation. Seven other indictments 
are pending for fugitives who fled the country. The Royal Embassy of Saudi 
Arabia paid its fine with a letter of credit for $150,000 to the U.S. 
Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
McPartlin said 35 NAFA members were convicted. Williston Shor of Mill Valley, 
Calif., editor of Hawk Chalk, the North American Falconers Assn.'s newsletter, 
said there were 27 convictions of NAFA members "that I might call serious . . . 
(and) more than 20 . . . were expelled from NAFA and told that if they were 
good boys they could reapply for membership after either a year or expiration 
of their probation, whichever came last." 
</P>
<P>
Feelings toward McPartlin were so bitter -- and remain so -- that federal 
agents issued him a bulletproof vest and guarded his house, where the Fish and 
Wildlife Service kept 106 confiscated falcons for several months. 
</P>
<P>
McPartlin says he never wore the bulletproof vest, but he thinks the 1985 
triple murder of a family named McKay in a house near his might have been meant 
for him. Authorities say it was simply a burglarly gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Beebe of Vancouver, Canada, has been called "the father of falconry" on 
the continent. He helped to form NAFA many years ago -- then was drummed out of 
it when Fish and Wildlife Service agents arrested him for robbing raptor nests 
and trying to smuggle birds across the border into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Beebe called the charges "totally false" and blamed Cade and colleague Jim 
Weaver, who managed the Cornell program, for setting him up. Beebe later wrote 
a booklet, "The Myth of the Vanishing Peregrine" and still claims that Cade and 
Weaver created the peregrine crisis for their own gain. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a fraud," Beebe repeated recently. "Peregrines are not now, were not 
then and never were endangered. . . . The endangered listing made peregrines 
million-dollar birds." 
</P>
<P>
The case against DDT, he said, was supported by comparing normal eggshells to 
the thickness of old eggs in museums and other collections, which he said had 
to be thicker than normal to survive the original removal of their contents. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Kiff disagrees. He is head of the Western Foundation for Vertebrate 
Zoology in Los Angeles and has the world's largest collection of birds' eggs -- 
about 800,000, including hundreds of peregrine eggs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no thin-shelled eggs from before (the introduction of DDT in) 1947," 
Kiff said. "(Saying there was no crisis is) a ridiculous assertion." 
</P>
<P>
Kiff called the Peregrine Fund people "the heroes of our time." 
</P>
<P>
The Peregrine Fund receives $345,000 of its annual budget of $1.5 million from 
the Fish and Wildlife Service. One FWS source said that for all the good it 
does for endangered species, its money would be better spent elsewhere, but 
that U.S. Senator James McClure (R-Ida.) keeps it coming to Boise. 
</P>
<P>
Oil-rich Arabs, who have received help from Peregrine Fund personnel in setting 
up their own breeding operations, also have contributed, along with several 
state fish and wildlife departments, including California's. The rest of the 
funding comes from many private individuals and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, Khalsa said, the Peregrine Fund has given birds to Arabs with 
an unofficial understanding that a handsome donation would return -- 
tantamount, he implies, to selling birds raised by a research facility 
supported by public funds. 
</P>
<P>
Khalsa, a former Cornell University student, was born Alan Howell Parrot in New 
England. At 22 he converted to the Sikh religion, changed his name and started 
wearing a turban. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham denied Khalsa's accusation that birds went to Arabs for money but 
confirmed that Arabs have made contributions in amounts up to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
If there is no evidence that the Peregrine Fund is doing business with Arabs 
directly, Khalsa said, they are at least laundering the birds through private 
breeders, such as Steve Baptiste of Reno, Nev. As a result of Operation Falcon, 
Baptiste and former partner David Jamieson were fined $25,000 each and Baptiste 
was put on five years' probation, which expired a year ago, for illegal 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson now works for Khalsa, who bought Jamieson's breeding farm. 
</P>
<P>
The Middle East falcon market went on hold with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 
2. Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein is believed to be a falconer, and Saudi Arabian 
falconers commonly have taken their birds to Iraq to hunt houbara bustards, a 
falcon's favorite desert prey. 
</P>
<P>
But Fish and Wildlife Service documents obtained through the Freedom of 
Information Act show exchanges of endangered peregrines between the Peregrine 
Fund and Baptiste as recently as June of '89, and sales by Baptiste to Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
Considering Baptiste's breeding ranch is owned by Dan Brimm of La Jolla, a 
heavy donor and former Peregrine Fund director, the Peregrine Fund's judgment 
in not keeping Baptiste at arm's length would seem questionable. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't necessarily disagree," Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '80s, the Peregrine Fund's Cade tried to get permission to support 
his operations by selling birds to Arabs but was refused by the FWS, under a 
condition of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibiting their commercial use. In 
November of 1981, Cade and 11 others -- among them Baptiste -- signed a 
statement of intent with the North American Raptor Breeders' Assn. "to obtain 
necessary changes in federal regulations to permit the sale of captive 
raptors." 
</P>
<P>
The law was changed in August of '83. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the progressive recovery of the peregrine drove down the falcon market 
from the boom years of the late '70s and early '80s. Peregrines now can be had 
for as little as $400. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INSIDE TRADING 
</P>
<P>
McPartlin and Khalsa claim that the Peregrine Fund has given birds to some of 
its own directors and others in return for favors or services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an old-boys' club," Khalsa said. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that, among Peregrine Fund directors and donors, Robert Berry and 
Dan Konkel of Sheridan, Wyo., each received two birds from the fund since 1988 
and Bond, of New Mexico, got one from Baptiste. 
</P>
<P>
During Operation Falcon in '84, an unbanded -- i.e., non-registered -- 
gyrfalcon, a large arctic bird owned by Bond, was seized at Baptiste's facility 
near Reno and placed in McPartlin's care at Great Falls along with 105 other 
confiscated birds that McPartlin described as "some of the most unkempt 
creatures I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
According to a Fish and Wildlife Service communication, Bond exerted pressure 
in Washington to get the bird back, and a few months later it was returned to 
Burnham at the Peregrine Fund's former facility in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham said some birds have been given to Peregrine Fund directors -- 
primarily those who donated the use of their personal birds to help start the 
project, and in many cases birds too old to be useful for breeding. 
</P>
<P>
Recent transactions with Baptiste, Burnham said, were "essentially at the 
request of the state of Nevada. The birds we sent him were anatums (a peregrine 
sub-species) that were released in downtown Las Vegas on a building. The ones 
he sent us were non-anatums. We released those back East." 
</P>
<P>
The three sub-species of North American peregrines are anatums, Peale's and 
tundra. Only the anatums were considered endangered, but the FWS grouped all 
sub-species as endangered under the act's "look-alike" clause because it 
believed even some experts can't tell one sub-species from another. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SUPERBIRDS 
</P>
<P>
Some say the Peregrine Fund is tampering too much with nature. When experts 
decided that anatum peregrines had been wiped out east of the Mississippi, a 
hybrid sub-species of Peale's and Spanish peregrines produced by artificial 
insemination was used for reintroduction -- in effect, some scientists say, 
replacing apples with oranges, when more "apples" were still available in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
But the Peregrine Fund said the eastern and western birds were too different. 
Critics say they used that as an excuse to create a superior, more marketable 
bird from test tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Teresa, an associate wildlife biologist specializing in endangered 
species with the California Department of Fish and Game, said: "They don't 
breed that way in the wild. It's just for falconers to have these superbirds . 
. . like (breeding) a grizzly bear with a polar bear." 
</P>
<P>
Former Peregrine Fund director Dan Brimm said: "I'm a little uneasy with it 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Dean Amadon, chairman emeritus of ornithology at the American Museum of Natural 
History in New York and author of "Eagles, Hawks and Falcons of the World," 
said: "I would favor taking something as close as you could, but . . . I don't 
think any harm has been done by mixing up these birds. The important thing is 
we're getting 'em back." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton White, a professor of zoology at Brigham Young University, is both a 
director of the Peregrine Fund and a member of the FWS-appointed recovery team. 
</P>
<P>
"The Peregrine Fund has created some problems because it has, by default, more 
or less monopolized the breeding and turning loose of peregrines," White said. 
"Private breeders want to be able to sell their product. (But) the Peregrine 
Fund makes no money on this." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham said that 90% of the peregrines bred at Boise are anatums. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, says Berry, president of the North American Raptor Breeders' Assn., 
non-endangered species, such as gyrfalcons, are plentiful in Canada and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"We've created an artificial market for something that is common," he said. 
"There will never be any profit in the sale of falcons." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FEDS 
</P>
<P>
The Montana license plates on McPartlin's mud-splattered pickup truck read 
"PERE GYR," the mark of a dedicated falconer. 
</P>
<P>
But he has been repeatedly discredited in Hawk Chalk, the NAFA newsletter, 
which has cited his '72 conviction for transporting two gyrfalcons across state 
lines without proper permits. McPartlin says the violation was inadvertent, 
although he pleaded guilty and paid a fine of $200. 
</P>
<P>
Shor said: "He was convicted (by NAFA) of lying on his application for 
membership." 
</P>
<P>
NAFA claims that McPartlin approached the Fish and Wildlife Service, offering 
to entrap and snitch on falconers. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," says Nando Mauldin, who was then special agent in charge of 
special operations for the FWS. 
</P>
<P>
Mauldin says that in 1977, aware of McPartlin's arrest record, he and agent 
Dave Kirkland went to Montana to recruit McPartlin. They paid him $2,000 a 
month. Afterward, McPartlin received several awards and commendations, 
including the prestigious Chevron Conservation Award, plus a $15,000 bonus from 
the FWS in ceremonies at Washington, D.C. His wife received $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
But he has been blacklisted by falconers' organizations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
NAFA also has accused McPartlin of trying to arrange to have two 
falconer-breeders killed. That accusation arose from a curbside conversation on 
June 28, 1984, between McPartlin and Marcus Ciesielski, a West German who with 
his brother Lothar was reputed to be a major falcon smuggler. 
</P>
<P>
McPartlin tells it this way: "The night before takedown, I was with another 
(FWS) federal agent, John Gavitt, sitting on a curb in front of a motel in 
Great Falls with Marcus Ciesielski a few hours before his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Marcus, (David) Jamieson is really causing me trouble . . . turning 
me in to the feds.' 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Oh, maybe we help. Maybe many broken bones and six months in 
hospital will work.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Well, it's both Jamieson and (Steve) Baptiste, and I don't think 
(that) will do it.' 
</P>
<P>
"And he looked at me calmly and said, 'Well, then we terminate them.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'What will it cost?' 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'You are a friend of my father. Maybe a little bit of money for the 
airplane and one female gyrfalcon.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'How will you do it?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'We have a man who comes over from Ankara, Turkey, and Interpol can't catch 
him.' 
</P>
<P>
"The whole purpose of that conversation was to determine the ability of the 
Ciesielskis to pull a hit on McPartlin, once it was learned that I was acting 
as an undercover federal agent." 
</P>
<P>
Operation Falcon was climaxed the next day with coordinated raids by U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service and Canadian Wildlife Service agents on suspected illegal 
falcon traffickers in the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
McPartlin had tried to "sting" falconers by selling them birds he had removed 
from the wild legally, under a special permit he had been issued by the FWS. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian journalist Paul McKay spent a year researching the operation, then 
wrote an award-winning report in Whig-Standard magazine two years ago and 
published a book expanding the story: "The Pilgrim and the Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
McKay's view is that many honest and innocent falcon fanciers were hurt in the 
sting. His treatment was not kind to McPartlin or Khalsa. 
</P>
<P>
NAFA's Shor said: "I examined the Operation Falcon data and concluded it was a 
fraud." 
</P>
<P>
The National Wildlife Federation's LeFranc disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the falconry people would like everyone to think," he said. "They 
argue that if the market wasn't there, they wouldn't have done anything 
illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Dave McMullen, the FWS' assistant regional director for law enforcement on the 
West Coast, based in Portland, Ore., said that illegal trafficking of falcons 
has dropped off since Operation Falcon. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no information of any money going back to the Peregrine Fund for the 
sale of falcons . . . laundered or otherwise . . . from illegal birds," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen also said: "I don't know why (NAFA) kicked (McPartlin) out. I don't 
think NAFA condones illegal activity . . . (or why it) punishes somebody that 
reports it. I don't understand why they're so obsessed." 
</P>
<P>
A P.R. PROBLEM 
</P>
<P>
McPartlin now lives in a small house on two acres of the rolling prairies of 
Montana. He keeps several falcons and flies them in the surrounding fields. 
</P>
<P>
At the kitchen table he refers to his log of Operation Falcon and says that of 
63 contacts made, he initiated only six, and that 56 of the contacts were NAFA 
members. He said there are 1,200 taped conversations to support his 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Shor referred to his own records and provided details of a survey of 
NAFA members indicating that 26 were approached first by McPartlin, who offered 
illegal deals to several. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, NAFA felt the damage was done. Jim Weaver then-president of NAFA, 
wrote in Hawk Chalk in April of '85: ". . . we have a monumental public 
relations problem." 
</P>
<P>
Writer Stephen J. Bodio of Magdalena, N.M., resigned from NAFA in '85 after 
Weaver asked him to kill his book, "A Rage of Falcons," and an excerpt that was 
to appear in the Smithsonian magazine. Bodio refused -- but said Weaver did 
persuade a photographer to withdraw his photos for the excerpt. 
</P>
<P>
Bodio said NAFA had "finally succumbed to the paranoia I have been arguing 
against for 10 years. . . . As long as we act as though we have something to 
hide, the public will assume that we do." 
</P>
<P>
Who is paranoid? McPartlin? NAFA? Everybody in falconry? 
</P>
<P>
In his account of Operation Falcon, McKay wrote that Khalsa was a government 
informant and was "universally loathed" afterward for his "treacherous ethics . 
. . (and) double-crosses." 
</P>
<P>
McPartlin was the government's only undercover operative. Khalsa's involvement 
was limited to snitching on two bird smugglers -- McKay's "Pilgrim and the 
Cowboy," Glen Luckman and McPartlin, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Khalsa admits his mission in life is not to make friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I have worked very hard to put my competition out of business," Khalsa said. 
"Every one of my competitors is terrified of me. I am ruthless. I don't care if 
they hate me. If you were pulling a big scam and I was yelling about it, you'd 
hate me, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I am also totally honest. I never sold my soul to the Peregrine Fund to get 
birds." 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, Operation Falcon found no wrongdoing in the Peregrine Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham of the Peregrine Fund said: "They would have loved to get us for 
something." 
</P>
<P>
He said that during Operation Falcon he got a call from McPartlin but refused 
to become involved with him. 
</P>
<P>
Berry said he also shied away from McPartlin. 
</P>
<P>
"I never returned the calls," he said. "I was totally convinced he was 
marketing birds (illegally). I never dreamed he was a federal agent. (Other) 
guys got sucked in by him." 
</P>
<P>
One source suggested that the FWS laid off the Peregrine Fund because it feared 
being embarrassed by its own heavy financial support of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Washington columnist Jack Anderson reported in 1976 that the CIA, attempting to 
curry favor with Middle East oil interests, had trapped falcons in Alaska to 
give to Arabs. That operation was not linked to the Peregrine Fund. 
</P>
<P>
But David Ellis, who heads the FWS' Captive Propagation Unit at the Patuxent 
Wildlife Research Center in Laurel, Md., said: "There have been a lot of 
interesting things done. I have been really concerned. I think there should be 
an audit, and the audit should be made public." 
</P>
<P>
Until a few years ago, Ellis was based in Arizona, where his 11-year study 
disputed a FWS finding and showed that peregrines there were thriving and 
didn't need a listing, contrary to what the Peregrine Fund was saying. The 
Arizona Game and Fish Department announced Nov. 6 the discovery of 10 more 
breeding pairs and a total of 42 territories of the state with reproducing 
peregrines. 
</P>
<P>
And James C. Bednarz of the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary Assn. in Pennsylvania 
questions the effect of captive-breeding programs, noting that population 
increases have occurred in 17 of 30 global regions surveyed without the aid of 
reintroduction, and that a ban on pesticides may be making more of a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Smylie, a FWS raptor expert in Albuquerque, N.M., conceded that in running 
the Peregrine Fund, Cade might have "stepped on some toes, and there are still 
some hard feelings -- but he saved a species . . . one of the few endangered 
species that has been saved." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FALCON FUTURES 
</P>
<P>
Brian Walton, the Santa Cruz researcher, is concerned that if the FWS 
down-lists the peregrine, California may follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
"The peregrine is making a great recovery in several areas of the United 
States," Walton said. "But we still have the pesticide problem in many areas." 
</P>
<P>
If the bird is to be down-listed, it could cost the Peregrine Fund its federal 
funding. Burnham said the center would try to carry on, without its most 
glamorous bird. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Peregrine Fund was created, there was no intention of us existing 
beyond recovery of the peregrine falcon," Burnham said. "There are a limited 
amount of resources that now need to be directed toward other species that need 
it." 
</P>
<P>
A major "Maya Project" is under way to study tropical raptors in Guatemala and 
Belize. Peregrine Fund biologist Willard Heck spends much of every year on the 
island of Mauritius off the east coast of Africa, working to save the rare 
Mauritius kestrel. 
</P>
<P>
Those and more than 40 other troubled species have been brought to Boise for 
study and breeding in buildings apart from the peregrines. There are malevolent 
looking black African eagles, American bald eagles, golden eagles, elf owls and 
Fiji and aplomado falcons. The facility conducts about 3,000 people through on 
tours each year. 
</P>
<P>
The peregrines are isolated in a shed similar to a cellblock. They flash their 
lethal talons as they swoop to the barred windows in the doors. They eyeball 
strangers fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
Especially during nesting time, scientists such as Heck and Cal Sandfort, the 
technical associate for raptor propagation, put in long hours for low salaries, 
watching over the various species via an array of TV monitors and through slits 
in doors. 
</P>
<P>
Although some claim the Peregrine Fund has ulterior motives to down-list the 
bird, Heck differs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way the Endangered Species Act works," he says. "A lot of 
protectionists are using the act to protect things in many directions. For 
example, to use the spotted owl to protect an old-growth forest, in my mind, is 
not the way it was meant to work. 
</P>
<P>
"You put things on (the list) when it's needed, but you're also obligated to 
take things off when it's not needed." 
</P>
<P>
The Peregrine Fund continues to release 200-300 birds a year. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham said: "There's no way in the world everybody's going to like us. But 
when you look at the whole record, it's pretty good."

Operation Falcon (by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1984)." The bird was

Former Laker LeRoy Ellis was given a job by a Syracuse alumnus at about the 
time his son LeRon decided to transfer from Kentucky to the school, the 
Syracuse Post-Standard reported. 
</P>
<P>
The story followed by a day a lengthy report in the Post-Standard in which past 
and current players said they received cash from team boosters, free meals, 
favorable grade changes, merchandise from community businessmen and cut-rate 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
The Post-Standard said that LeRon Ellis appeared ready to transfer to Nevada 
Las Vegas in June of 1989 after Kentucky was put on probation by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Post-Standard, Ellis' father received a license to work as a 
real estate salesman for the Hicker Co., Inc., which does business as the 
Cardinal Co. in Sherman Oaks. The company's owner, George Hicker, was a 
teammate of Coach Jim Boeheim at Syracuse during the 1960s.

Cincinnati Bengal cornerback Lewis Billups says the team doctor gave him two 
Valium tablets to ease leg cramps during a game against San Francisco Dec. 9, 
"but . . . whoa, it was kind of hard to play football like that. I had to come 
back out." 
</P>
<P>
The doctor, Robert Heidt Jr., could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Valium is not among the NFL's banned substances, but because it is a 
prescription drug administered only by a team physician, a report must be filed 
to the league office, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Siegel, a Cincinnati orthopedic surgeon who treats high school athletes, 
said: "I'd hate to second-guess, but I'd be very cautious to give Valium to 
someone who is going to perform a direct impact type of sport like football."

Rookie defensive tackle Fred Washington of the Chicago Bears and a woman 
companion were killed in a one-car crash at 2:30 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The car driven by Washington struck a tree about two miles from his home in 
suburban Lake Forest, Deputy Police Chief Gary Wieczorek said. 
</P>
<P>
Lake County Coroner Barbara Richardson said the car appeared to have been 
traveling at high speed. The victims were pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Weather conditions were good and no evidence of alcohol or other drugs was 
found in the car, which was registered to the woman, Petra Stoll, 22. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Ditka said that Washington, a second-round draft choice from Texas 
Christian, was a "coach's dream (who) worked hard and never complained, never 
was hurt, never griped. We're going to try and dedicate the rest of the year to 
Fred." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-2, 277-pound Washington had been used sparingly until recent weeks, 
when he began filling in for injured Dan Hampton.

FAIR BOARD TURNS DOWN BID FOR HARNESS MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The board of directors of the Los Angeles County Fair Assn. has turned down a 
bid for a harness racing meeting next spring and summer at Fairplex Park in 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Arnold, president and general manager of Los Alamitos, sought to lease 
dates at the Pomona facility from April 26 to Aug. 17 to create a virtual 
year-round Southern California standardbred circuit between Los Alamitos 
meetings from February to April and August to November. 
</P>
<P>
The California Horse Racing Board approved Arnold's request Nov. 3, reversing 
an earlier stand, but limited any agreement to one year. 
</P>
<P>
"The CHRB sent a signal that Pomona would be used as an interim facility 
between now and the time a new facility in Riverside would be built," Ralph 
Hinds, president of the Los Angeles County Fair Assn., said Friday. "It was not 
a long-range plan. Originally, we had talked about a long-range plan with Mr. 
Arnold involving a three-year lease and two three-year options. 
</P>
<P>
"We spoke out clearly at the CHRB meeting that we were not interested in a 
short-term program, and the decision should not come as a surprise. We are 
already involved in a successful long-range thoroughbred training program 
(involving about 700 horses)."

KID BEAT: IT'S A CHILD'S STORY ON BEETHOVEN, BACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Dear Uncle, something terrible has happened. A madman has moved into our 
house!" So begins "Beethoven Lives Upstairs," winner of Canada's Juno award for 
best children's recording and part of the exceptional new "Classical Kids" 
audiocassette series. 
</P>
<P>
The first offerings in the series, "Beethoven Lives Upstairs" and "Mr. Bach 
Comes to Visit," draw children into another century with entertaining and 
literate biographical drama, featuring a child as the central character. 
</P>
<P>
Each composer's music -- a rich selection of familiar and unfamiliar works -- 
is interwoven into the story and comes alive, demystified and accessible. 
</P>
<P>
Creator Susan Hammond, a pianist, mother and teacher, designed the series to 
"take classical music out of its black clothes and have it speak naturally to 
children, the way it was first heard. 
</P>
<P>
"Children, especially, experience music on an emotional level," Hammond said 
from her home in Canada, "not an intellectual one. For some reason, we treat 
classical music with a hands-off approach and we lose so much. Music was not 
composed in that spirit." 
</P>
<P>
In "Mr. Bach Comes to Call," the composer has taken a time trip to the present 
to visit a young piano student. "Mr. Bach explains his music with joy and love 
and fun," Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
With Beethoven, Hammond and writer Barbara Nichol get "closer to the music and 
the man. "We try to wrap a whole culture around the music, open up an 
un-20th-Century world." Young listeners are also gradually made aware of the 
tragedy of Beethoven's deafness. The recording ends with his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
Death "is part of life," Hammond said. "We're showing the glow of what was left 
because that person lived. They see the sadness, but they see what was left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
"Dry facts won't lead children to classical music," she added. "They've got to 
feel it. We want kids to like these composers, enjoy their humor, and life. The 
heart follows the mind." 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said the cassettes are structured "in layers of meaning and complexity. 
A 5-year-old loves the drama. Ages 6 or 7 and up will notice a particular 
piece." 
</P>
<P>
A third release, "Mozart's Magic Fantasy," due out in late January, takes yet 
another tack. It's "a wild romp through 'The Magic Flute,' " Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
Available on the Children's Group/BMG label at Tower Records, the Wherehouse 
and Children's Book and Music Center in Santa Monica. Cassette: $9.98. CD: 
$14.98.

STAGE BEAT: UNEVEN STAGING OF 'PHILADELPHIA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Irish playwright Brian Friel's coming-of-age drama, "Philadelphia, Here I 
Come," enjoys just the right dank physical texture at the Richard Basehart 
Theatre in Woodland Hills. This is not the Ireland of shamrocks, but of a 
tangled, damp village in County Donegal in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The production catches with moderate success the play's tender, melancholy and 
occasionally raucous impulses. But this personal odyssey, set on the eve of a 
young man's traumatic departure from Ireland for Philadelphia, is unevenly 
staged, and the production is undermined by a performance that gets out of 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Brogan Roche, as protagonist Gareth O'Donnell's private, subconscious self 
(whom the other characters can't see), is so out there with poses and stand-up 
routines that he detracts from the play. Director Ben Slack fails to rein in 
his talented but hammy excesses. 
</P>
<P>
The young hero's public persona is sensitively, even sweetly performed by 
Eamonn Roche (brother of Brogan). The girl he leaves behind is gently played by 
Susan McMartin (daughter of actor John McMartin, in her stage debut). 
</P>
<P>
Ivy Bethune's feisty housekeeper, Linda Gary's brash Philadelphia aunt, and 
Stuart Lancaster's morose and dour father contribute sturdy portraits. 
</P>
<P>
"Philadelphia, Here I Come," Richard Basehart Theatre, 21028-B Victory Blvd., 
Woodland Hills, Wednesdays, Thursdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Jan. 24. 
$12-$15. (818) 704-1845. Running Time: 2 hours, 20 minutes. RAY LOYND

<P>
If only "Trust Your Goosebumps, Cornelius Puck!" at the Matrix, elicited a 
single goosebump, we might trust it. But this show is likelier to produce 
yawns. 
</P>
<P>
It's a mindless musical examination of a wealthy 35-year-old man (Gary Imhoff) 
searching for his true self. He had followed his parents' (Greg Mullavey and 
Kelly Britt) advice to get rich, marrying a tawdry mercenary (Lindy Robbins) 
along the way instead of his childhood friend (Stacey Shaffer) who urged him to 
write music instead. But now he wants out. 
</P>
<P>
So do we -- from this show. 
</P>
<P>
How does he escape? By running for President, of course. Guided by a chubby but 
remarkably elastic angel (Avery Saltzman), he recruits a black running mate 
(Wren T. Brown) and tries to win by losing. Or is it lose by winning? 
</P>
<P>
Writer Allan Jay Friedman's cliches -- musical, lyrical and dramaturgical -- 
are endless. That childhood friend, for example, grows up to become -- yes -- 
an artist in Paris. Spare us. 
</P>
<P>
David Galligan's cast is professional enough, but it's hard to imagine that 
anyone outside Friedman's family and friends really believes in this project. 
</P>
<P>
"Trust Your Goosebumps, Cornelius Puck!" Matrix Theatre, 7657 Melrose Ave., 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; matinees Saturdays, Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends Jan. 20. 
$14.50; (213) 852-1445. Running time: 2 hours, 20 minutes.

Knifing winds and 45-degree temperatures couldn't deter a hearty group of 
Walrus Club members Friday from taking their traditional December plunge into 
the chilly Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
About 95 otherwise clear-thinking men and women -- clad only in shorts or 
swimsuits -- walked, jogged and later jumped into the ocean as part of the 
fifth-annual Walrus Run. The teeth-chattering event covered nearly 2 miles, 
starting from the Newport Beach Athletic Club and ending in the 58-degree 
waters off Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The brainchild of Rudy Svrcek and a small group of Walrus Club members, the run 
has become a quirky holiday tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a Christmas party for us," said second-year Walrus runner Tina 
Bazacas, 35, and a manager at the athletic club. "It's not a fund-raiser or 
anything. It's just for fun." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Rhone, a Newport Beach real estate broker and five-year Walrus veteran, 
added: "It's a little craziness." He said the best way to prepare is "just get 
up, get out of bed and do it."

<P>
Five-time veteran Rick Blake, 41, of Newport Beach said just the thought of 
hitting the water in such cold weather makes him shiver. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's crazy," he said. "It's Newport Beach crazy people. That's what it 
is. Crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Ryan, the Walrus' unofficial Santa Claus, said the runners are a hearty 
group of jokesters. 
</P>
<P>
"They almost threw me in last year," said Ryan, who wore a red Santa suit and 
white beard as he greeted runners as they crossed from the sand to the water. 
</P>
<P>
Although some Walrus runners were experienced, others were not. Aiko Kris, a 
determined second-year runner, huffed and puffed nearly a mile before accepting 
a ride from a van traveling down the First Avenue route. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always the last guy," said Kris, who is in her 50s. 
</P>
<P>
The Walrus Club accepts new members each year, but participants said it's 
sometimes difficult to convince prospects that jumping into the ocean during 
winter can be fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to get my friends to do it, but they're a little more sane than I am," 
said Tom Van Over, 41, a three-year Walrus veteran. "In December, running into 
the water is stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
Knox Brooks of Irvine is a self-proclaimed old-timer in the club. At 60, the 
two-time runner said there's only one thing that motivates him to face the cold 
beach sands each December: "Pure insanity. It runs in the family."

JUDGE MAY HAVE TO HAND OFF SUIT ON JAIL CROWDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles federal judge who for 15 years has presided in an Orange County 
jail-overcrowding suit is recovering from brain surgery and questioning whether 
he will be retained on the controversial case. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William P. Gray, 78, said Friday that he had a small benign 
tumor removed from his brain Dec. 7 and will not return to the bench for 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not cancerous," Gray said from his Pasadena home. "I'm doing just fine. 
The doctor says it will probably be five or six weeks, or maybe the first of 
March, before I will be able to be back on the bench. They expect I will be 
just fine and lead a normal life." 
</P>
<P>
Gray said he is concerned about his pending cases, and those "that can't wait" 
are being reassigned. He said it isn't clear yet what will happen in the county 
jail case. A major hearing on a motion to limit crowding in the jail system was 
postponed in November when the judge had to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of cases, and some of them need to be handled earlier than I can 
do it," Gray said. "We're just now trying to separate those that need to be 
done right away. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, a concern is the Santa Ana jail (case). I have a lot of background 
with it, and the question is how long can we wait." 
</P>
<P>
Handing over such a longstanding, complex case to another judge "would be very 
unfortunate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who was named to the federal bench in 1966 by President Lyndon B. 
Johnson, issued a 1978 order capping the inmate population at the Central Men's 
Jail in Santa Ana. After once ruling that county officials had violated 
inmates' rights because of continuing jail overcrowding, the judge slapped 
Sheriff Brad Gates with a contempt citation. 
</P>
<P>
In one hearing, Gray called the jail's practice of confining naked inmates in 
so-called rubber room isolation cells "inhumane and almost medieval." 
</P>
<P>
Gray said the other major case he is concerned about involves Long Beach and 
the state against oil companies in a lawsuit alleging price-fixing 
conspiracies. That case, which Gray has also been handling for 15 years, is 
expected to go to court June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Swelling from the surgery has caused Gray some speaking problems. He said he 
will need several weeks of X-rays to remove parts of the tumor in sensitive 
parts of his brain that could not be removed surgically.

CALTRANS STUDY FOCUSES ON NEW CAR-POOL LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It may look like just another crowded interstate, but a four-mile swath of the 
San Diego Freeway running through this community is serving these days as a 
sort of laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
The unveiling of the microscope took place Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Transportation has installed seven videotape 
cameras atop freeway overpasses between Jeffrey Road and Irvine Center Drive 
that will be used to study the demeanor of the new set of car-pool lanes that 
were opened along the freeway earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
These car-pool lanes, after all, are anything but typical. Instead of the usual 
double-yellow line separating them from the slow-moving masses, the Interstate 
405 commuter lanes have a 14-foot-wide buffer of asphalt between them and 
general-use lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials are eager to determine if the new car-pool lanes, which are 
the first of their kind in the United States, will perform better than the old 
ones. The $48,000 worth of videotape cameras and recorders deployed along the 
freeway will help with that task, Caltrans officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're going to look at with these cameras is the operational 
characteristics of the 14-foot buffer," said Joe El-Harake, commuter lanes 
coordinator for Caltrans in Orange County. "Right now, there's no real design 
standard for the buffer between the lanes. This is an evolving science. We're 
trying to push the limits of design." 
</P>
<P>
The cameras are mounted on freeway overpasses and feed their pictures to 
recorders in sealed boxes nearby. Each camera fires off a picture every few 
seconds, so when the tapes are played at normal speed the movements of cars are 
speeded up. With this time-elapsed video, a two-hour videotape can last three 
days before a Caltrans work crew has to install a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
When the tapes are returned to Caltrans district headquarters in Santa Ana, 
El-Harake and other officials can monitor the disposition of the car-pool lanes 
with a simple TV screen and VCR, watching three hours worth of traffic rush by 
in less than half an hour. The tapes also carry the "real time" in minutes, the 
date and the location where the pictures were being shot. 
</P>
<P>
By monitoring the videos, officials will learn how the car-pool lanes and their 
revolutionary 14-foot buffers perform. They can count the number of people who 
risk a ticket by violating the buffer, an offense that carries a $246 fine, and 
study how well the car-pool lane performs as traffic slows in the mixed-use 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials have been studying the pictures delivered by the cameras for 
only about a week, and the entire study will continue for another six months. 
But it already appears that the 14-foot buffers are a significant improvement 
on the old designs, El-Harake said. 
</P>
<P>
There are fewer violations in the new lane. In addition, the buffer appears to 
help keep traffic in the car-pool lane moving at a good clip even when the 
general-use lanes jam up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With a normal car-pool lane separated by a narrow yellow line, motorists have a 
natural tendency to hit the brakes when they see traffic slow in the other 
lanes. But with wide expanse of asphalt separating them from the heavy traffic, 
motorists in the Irvine car-pool lanes seem to have less reluctance to ease up 
on the gas pedal when traffic slows in the other lanes, El-Harake said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, preliminary results show that the wide buffer acts as more of a 
deterrent to motorists who might otherwise skip across the double-yellow lines 
to sneak into the car-pool lane. As deciphered from the videotapes, the 
violation rate on any given day ranged from less than 1% to 1.5%, well below 
the current average of 4% on the Costa Mesa Freeway car-pool lanes, which 
feature a four-foot buffer along most of their length. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this bigger buffer represents a real mental barrier for most people," 
El-Harake said. "They just don't want to risk crossing something that wide. 
They're almost behaving as if they have a physical barrier there." 
</P>
<P>
An offshoot of the improvements, he said, may be reflected by the number of 
people using the commuter lanes. The San Diego Freeway's car-pool lanes through 
Irvine have managed to pick up a large number of users far more quickly than 
did the commuter lanes on the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
During peak periods, about 1,450 cars an hour are using the Interstate 405 
car-pool lanes, which opened in May. The lanes on the Costa Mesa Freeway had 
only about 800 cars an hour after they were in use a half-year, El-Harake said. 
</P>
<P>
Such results have convinced El-Harake and other commuter lanes specialists at 
Caltrans that the wide-buffer car-pool lane is the wave of the future. 
</P>
<P>
Although the larger buffer cannot prevent accidents -- unlike a concrete 
barrier -- they are far less expensive, he said. In addition, a concrete 
barrier takes up just about as much real estate because of the need for 
shoulder space. 
</P>
<P>
While the cameras along the San Diego Freeway are providing authorities with 
rolls and rolls of videotape, none of it is being used by law-enforcement 
agencies for any purposes, El-Harake said. 
</P>
<P>
But the cameras eventually might play a role in helping to police the freeways. 
After the car-pool lane study is completed next year, Caltrans plans to install 
microwave equipment at each overpass so the video pictures can be relayed to 
monitors in the newly opened Orange County traffic operations center in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities then will be able to detect traffic accidents or other problems 
much more quickly and dispatch help.

COUNCILMAN FAILS TO REPORT WIFE'S INCOME FROM FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
ETHICS: GARY L. HAUSDORFER MIGHT HAVE VIOLATED STATE LAW IN NOT DISCLOSING THE 
INFORMATION. HIS SPOUSE WORKS FOR A COMPANY THAT HAS CITY CONTRACTS.

<P>
City Councilman and regional transportation commissioner Gary L. Hausdorfer, in 
possible violation of state law, has failed to disclose income received by his 
wife from a prominent planning and engineering firm that does business in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Records reviewed by The Times also show that Hausdorfer -- who was mayor at the 
time -- voted in September to approve a city contract with a company whose 
subcontractors included the firm that employs his wife. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Hausdorfer said Friday that he was unaware when he voted that 
his wife's employer, The Keith Cos., was authorized in the contract to receive 
$8,100. That vote and his failure to report his wife's income on his 1988 and 
1989 disclosure forms, he said, might have been "mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
"You try to avoid all these things, and life's too short not to," said 
Hausdorfer, who owns a commercial mortgage business. " . . . If I've made 
mistakes, then I'll take the blame. . . . We certainly have nothing to hide." 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer's wife, Debora, is director of public affairs for The Keith Cos., a 
firm that does work on behalf of developers and public agencies throughout 
Orange County. She said that she began working for Keith in late 1988 and that 
her duties include efforts to obtain new contracts -- although not in San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
State conflict-of-interest law requires public officials to disclose the 
sources of their income -- including community property income generated by a 
spouse -- and to abstain from governmental decisions that affect those income 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being a councilman since 1978, Hausdorfer also is a member of 
two powerful regional transportation agencies: the Orange County Transit 
District and the Foothill-Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer said that he recently abstained on one matter that came before the 
Foothill Transportation Corridor -- the agency that is building two toll roads 
in eastern Orange County -- because The Keith Cos. had an involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't vote on anything that has their name on it," said Hausdorfer, 44. 
</P>
<P>
The San Juan Capistrano council vote involving the Costa Mesa-based firm came 
in September, at a time when Hausdorfer was serving as mayor. The issue was 
whether to approve a $304,197 contract for a study of how to use 140 acres of 
agricultural land that San Juan Capistrano voters agreed last spring to acquire 
through a $120-million bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Keith Cos., which had received earlier city payments for studying the 140 
acres and surrounding properties in the city's northwest area, was authorized 
in the September contract to get $8,100 of the total award. After presentations 
by planners and discussion, the council voted unanimously to approve the 
contract, according to minutes of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (The Keith Cos.) are officially a part of the team, I didn't know it, 
and it wasn't pointed out to me" at the time of the council's vote, Hausdorfer 
said, noting that the bulk of the award went to The Keith French Group, a San 
Clemente firm unrelated to the company that employs Debora Hausdorfer. 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer had championed the open-space initiative approved by voters last 
spring. And, The Keith Cos. has been involved in studying that land since at 
least 1988, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano paid The Keith Cos. $19,081 -- on Aug. 10, 1989, and on 
June 28, 1990 -- for work related to the city's "Northwest Planning Study." 
Records reviewed by The Times also show that, beginning in May, 1987, and 
continuing through October, 1990, San Juan Capistrano paid the firm $109,321 
for other professional services. The council approved all the Keith payments in 
routine "consent calendar" actions. 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer, commenting on his not reporting his wife's income on his disclosure 
statements, said that he did not believe he was required to do so because Keith 
was not operating and "located" in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
State law, however, requires officials such as Hausdorfer to disclose such an 
income source if the company is located or has done business within the city, 
according to Jeevan Ahuja, an attorney with the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission. Ahuja said that a company's physical location is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the case," said Hausdorfer, "it's easy to amend (the earlier 
disclosure statements) and I'll check with the FPPC and the city attorney." 
</P>
<P>
The Keith firm has been active with a number of other significant projects in 
San Juan Capistrano since the mid-1980s, including the planning and designing 
of a members-only development that was approved by the council in 1987 and 1988 
-- the Marbelle Golf and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Hausdorfer said his wife went to work for Keith in late 1988 after being 
introduced to the firm's owner by her former employer. 
</P>
<P>
"I stay out of my wife's business career," Hausdorfer said. "She stays out of 
mine."

TEEN MOMS NURTURE EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 20 teen-age mothers brought their diaper bags, strollers and babies to 
Gilbert High School on Friday for the continuation school's annual baby 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, there have been about 40 births to students at the 
school. "These girls have a tough enough time," said Shirley Wood, who teaches 
the Pregnant Girl Program. "They need a positive experience. We say, 'Hey, 
you're OK and we love your children.' " 
</P>
<P>
Unlike state and nationwide trends, teen birth rates are slightly on the rise 
in Orange County, according to 1988 statistics, the most recent available. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, it's "epidemic," Wood said. The Anaheim Union High School District 
has had no formal family life curriculum since 1969 when a lawsuit was brought 
against the district. Its birth rate for 15- to 17-year-olds is second only to 
Santa Ana Unified in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an acceptable thing, not a disgrace like it used to be," Wood said. "It's 
an in thing for a lot of them." 
</P>
<P>
One girl at the celebration said she got pregnant to please a former boyfriend. 
Another said she wanted to spite her divorcing mother. "I wanted something," 
she said. "My mom took my dad away. She can't take my son away." 
</P>
<P>
Cuddling her 9-month-old daughter, Brittany, Tamara Henley, 18, said she was 
ready for the responsibilities of marriage, family and work, and plans to enter 
Cypress College next fall. She and her husband, Tom, 20, a mechanic, live in an 
apartment a few blocks from the school and plan to buy a home in March. 
</P>
<P>
A minority of the girls in Wood's program are working, and a few receive 
welfare. But most are living at home with their parents, who are frequently 
single mothers themselves, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
At continuation school, the girls study at their own pace, completing their 
required schoolwork on a contract basis and also taking electives in pregnancy, 
child care and development and parenting. 
</P>
<P>
The babies cooed, cried and toddled around a twinkling Christmas tree in the 
school registration area, as the mothers chatted with teachers and each other 
while students passed by in between classes. Wood said it appeared that the 
young mothers had benefited from her classes because the babies looked 
"healthy, well-nourished and clean." 
</P>
<P>
The young mothers' academic skills vary widely, but in general, they perform 
better academically than average students, said Jerry Kill, director of 
alternative education. "They're more serious about getting an education," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Becky Stewart, 19, who is eight months pregnant, arrived with her 2-year-old 
son, Mitchell. Stewart, a grocery store worker who lives with her mother, has 
attended night school for three years and hopes to graduate by June. "If you 
want something for your kids," she said, "you need an education." LYNN SMITH

</P>
<P>
FIRE CHIEF GLAD HE'S HELPED MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tears welled up in Fire Chief Raymond C. Picard's eyes after he embraced an 
employee leaving for a better job in another city's fire department. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not crying because of me," said Picard, who is retiring. "These are tears 
of joy. I'm happy for her." 
</P>
<P>
During his 23 years as Huntington Beach's fire chief, Picard said, one of his 
greatest pleasures has been watching members of his staff advance in their 
careers. He proudly points out that six of his former subordinates became fire 
chiefs at other cities. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, as chief of the department, what are you here for? The people. And 
it's wonderful to see them make their lives better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Picard, who will cap four decades of fire service when he retires Monday, is 
revered throughout the state as one of California's best and most creative fire 
chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
He has served on many state and national firefighting committees, and has a 
gubernatorial appointment to the California State Board of Fire Services. He 
has also garnered dozens of awards and accolades, including a governor's award 
for his leadership in the wake of the Feb. 7 oil spill off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But he says that the plaques, certificates and recognition hardly measure up to 
the reward of having helped others. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line in this job is that the pride comes from serving people in the 
community," he said. "It all comes down to 'Did you do good? Have you made 
others' lives better? Are a lot of people now living, or recuperating from 
entrapments or physical injuries, in part because of your efforts?' " 
</P>
<P>
"To be able to say that hundreds of people (injured in disasters) today are 
vital members of society as a result of your accomplishments is deeply 
rewarding. Nothing is more tragic than to have a member of your family die or 
have personal tragedies" as a result of an accident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Picard formed the region's training and response network, introduced Orange 
County's first computer-assisted dispatching system and advanced the area's 
paramedic and hazardous-material response services. 
</P>
<P>
"He approaches firefighting as a military person would a campaign," Mayor Peter 
M. Green said. "He has a good, analytical mind. Also, he's brought creativity 
to the area . . . and (he) is very personable." 
</P>
<P>
Picard plans to spend much of his retirement with his family, playing 
racquetball and golf, skiing and rediscovering his passion from his younger 
days -- surfing. 
</P>
<P>
But, he admits, he likely will never abandon fire service altogether. 
</P>
<P>
He said his major retirement project will be to develop an accreditation system 
for fire service associations throughout North America, in order to "raise the 
professional standards and excellence of fire agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I may do an isolated seminar or lecture here or there, just for fun," he 
added. "And I want to continue my professional focus, by writing periodicals 
and texts on things I know and I feel should be recorded and made a part of 
history." JOHN PENNER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;

<P>
MAN MISTAKENLY JAILED GETS $8,000 
</P>

<P>
The City Council has agreed to pay $8,000 to settle a 2-year-old lawsuit filed 
by a man who was mistakenly jailed by Laguna Beach police. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report presented to the City Council this week, Shawn Russell 
spent three days in Orange County Jail in November, 1988, after being 
mistakenly arrested on an outstanding traffic warrant. 
</P>
<P>
The warrant stemmed from an April, 1988, incident in which a Laguna Beach 
police officer stopped Christopher Porcher, Russell's roommate at the time, for 
allegedly driving the wrong way on a one-way street. 
</P>
<P>
Porcher, then a Dana Point resident, told police that he left his driver's 
license at home and identified himself as Russell, according to City Manager 
Kenneth C. Frank. After Russell was arrested and jailed, he filed a lawsuit 
against the city of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said the physical descriptions of the two men were similar. But Russell, 
who now lives in North Carolina, maintained that the Police Department should 
have been able to tell the difference, Frank added. 
</P>
<P>
According to Frank's report, Russell was awarded $20,000 during arbitration and 
the city later requested a trial. However, during a pretrial conference, the 
parties agreed to settle for $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Frank asked the council for authorization to settle the claim 
because, he said, it would cost less than going to court. The council agreed.

WRONG-WAY DRIVER GETS READ RIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
NEAR-DISASTER: THE SUSPECTED DRUNKEN MAN TRAVELS ALMOST A MILE ON THE SANTA ANA 
FREEWAY BEFORE CHP CAN STOP HIM.

A suspected drunken motorist drove the wrong way on the Santa Ana Freeway for 
almost a mile Thursday night, but patrol officers were able to stop him before 
a collision occurred, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's real lucky he didn't kill anybody," CHP Officer Linda Burrus said. "We 
just happened to be at the right place at the right time this time." 
</P>
<P>
John Matthew Tafe, 36, of Perris was booked on a misdemeanor charge of driving 
while under the influence of alcohol after he was stopped at the Chapman Avenue 
exit, just north of the Garden Grove Freeway interchange, Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began shortly after 9 p.m. when CHP dispatchers began receiving 
reports that a motorist was driving on the wrong way on the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Burrus said that a motorist spotted Tafe's 1987 red Ford pickup truck entering 
the Flower Street exit of the southbound side of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
By the time three CHP units were alerted, dispatchers received two more calls 
from people who saw Tafe speed northbound on the southbound side of the 
freeway, Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
One CHP unit, driven by Officer Jim Malner, was nearby and got on the 
northbound side of the freeway to try to get ahead of Tafe, Burrus said. 
Looking over the center divider Malner and his partner, Officer Jim Ward, 
spotted Tafe going in the same direction and sped up to head him off near the 
Chapman Avenue exit, Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
While other units attempted to reach Tafe from behind, Malner and Ward entered 
the freeway on the wrong side from the Chapman exit and drove along the 
shoulder with the unit's headlights and emergency lights flashing. 
</P>
<P>
"(Malner) put everything on to blind him so he (Tafe) would have to stop," 
Burrus said. 
</P>
<P>
The ploy worked, Burrus said, because Tafe slowed down onto the shoulder and 
stopped in front of the patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, two people were killed and a third was critically injured 
when a car heading the wrong way on the San Diego Freeway collided head-on with 
another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
According to the CHP, Faith Robinson, 23, of Fountain Valley had driven the 
wrong way on the freeway for more than eight miles when the accident occurred 
Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
CHP dispatchers said they began receiving calls about 4:30 a.m. that Robinson 
had entered the San Diego Freeway through the Westminster off-ramp. As officers 
jockeyed into position to form a traffic break and head her off, Robinson 
neared the Bristol Street exit and smashed into a car driven by Sang In Ahn, 
50, of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Ahn died shortly after that crash. His 47-year-old wife, Ook-Ja, remains 
hospitalized at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who died six days later, was determined to have a blood-alcohol level 
of .15, almost double the legal limit, authorities said.

HORDES OF LAST-MINUTE TRAVELERS, SHOPPERS EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Orange County residents this weekend are expected to flock to the malls and 
journey to visit friends and families out of town as the last few days before 
Christmas creep up, jamming highways and parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Friday and today were expected to generate the heaviest traffic at John Wayne 
Airport, where the new Thomas F. Riley Terminal is experiencing its first 
Christmas season. Airport spokeswoman Courtney Wiercioch said the number of 
passengers will not surpass the record set on the day before Thanksgiving, 
traditionally the busiest travel day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Wiercioch said the number of passengers should taper off by Christmas Day but 
pick up again immediately afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend is the three days before Christmas are our heaviest days, and then 
you go down when you get to Christmas, and right after Christmas, it goes up 
again with people returning," Wiercioch explained. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers heading to cities with wet and snowy weather may experience some 
flight delays, as occurred Friday for travelers headed for Denver, Chicago and 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
But the airport's expanded facilities should ease the flow of traffic, 
officials said, since only a small increase in passenger loads is expected this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
For those traveling by road, the California Highway Patrol offered this 
suggestion: leave early. 
</P>
<P>
"Plan on it taking you a little longer than usual to get where you want to go," 
said CHP spokeswoman Linda Burrus. "We expect some pretty heavy traffic out 
there until Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Burrus said weather conditions might also be a factor. "We're getting snow at 
the higher elevations and motorists will need chains on some highways," she 
cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
Burrus said that Orange County motorists should expect delays on the northbound 
Santa Ana and San Diego freeways as people headed toward Northern California or 
funneled into Los Angeles International Airport. The southbound Santa Ana 
Freeway should also be busy, with people traveling to San Diego and Mexico, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To handle the traffic crunch, the CHP will "have extra units out there all 
weekend until Christmas time," Burrus said. And she cautioned that officers 
will be watching for drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"The past couple of days, we've been arresting a lot of people who have been 
getting into the spirit a little too much," Burrus said. "It's pretty easy to 
find them this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
Last-minute shoppers should also be in plentiful supply this weekend, despite 
the recent downturn in the economy and slower-than-usual holiday sales, 
retailers said. With many people taking Christmas Eve -- a Monday -- off from 
work, shoppers will have a three-day grace period to make those last-minute 
purchases.

CHILD MOLESTER HELD ON PAROLE CHARGE

<P>
Police have arrested a convicted child molester on suspicion of violating his 
probation by being unsupervised in the company of a 14-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
John Pizzini, 30, of Costa Mesa was arrested Thursday at an undisclosed Costa 
Mesa residence, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Pizzini, who pleaded guilty to four counts of molesting a 14-year-old girl 
earlier this year, was released from jail in October after serving a 
three-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
He was placed on three years' probation, which required him to register with 
police as a sex offender and stay away from minors. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Orange County district attorney's office asked for an 
investigation into whether Pizzini violated his probation by hiring minors to 
sell candy bars.

Keith Huff, an All-Mission Conference running back from Long Beach City 
College, has made an oral commitment to play football at Cal State Fullerton, 
Viking Coach Wil Shaw said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Huff played fullback for three games this past season but moved to tailback 
after Chris Shockley was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Huff, a 5-foot-11, 205-pounder who played high school football in Florida, 
finished with 915 yards and six touchdowns. He chose Fullerton over Eastern 
Michigan and Ohio University. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw also said that Long Beach City wide receiver Oscar Ford, a former Servite 
High School standout who caught 13 passes for 180 yards this season, would sign 
a letter of intent with Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Coach Gene Murphy said he has received letters of intent from two other 
community college players, Fullerton College offensive lineman Abe Elliott and 
Moorpark College linebacker Matt Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, 6-5, 270 pounds, was a backup offensive tackle to highly regarded 
Chuck Underwood, who signed with Arizona State, and Vince Galaz. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott attended Raton High School in New Mexico and was an all-state selection 
as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson, 6 feet and 224 pounds, started at inside linebacker for Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said Elliott and Pearson have obtained their Associate of Arts degrees 
and will enroll at Fullerton in the spring semester.

FROM GARAGE POTPOURRI TO SWEET SCENT OF SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERPRISE: MICHAEL FANNING OF HUNTINGTON BEACH HAS SEEN SALES OF HIS COLORFUL 
BLEND OF DRIED FLOWER PETALS, SPICES AND HERBS ZOOM 1,402% FROM 1985 TO 1989. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Michael Fanning snaked his way past rows of cloth sacks and big plastic 
drums stacked in his Huntington Beach warehouse, he paused to take in the sweet 
fragrance that hung in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the cinnamon from Indonesia and Sri Lanka, the balsam pine from Canada 
and other fragrance oils from all over Asia and Europe that make this part of 
the building smell so Christmasy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fragrance that Fanning described is familiar to most people as potpourri, a 
colorful blend of dried flower petals, spices and herbs that are popular during 
the holiday season. This is a busy time of year for Fanning's company, 
Potpourri Foundry, which supplies potpourri to such major retailers as 
Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom, Mervyn's and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to growing demand for natural fragrance among environmentally conscious 
consumers, Fanning's business has blossomed. Founded six years ago, the 
40-employee Huntington Beach firm expects sales of roughly $4 million this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Potpourri Foundry recently was ranked by Inc. magazine as America's 238th 
fastest-growing, privately held company, with sales zooming 1,402% from $246 in 
1985 to $3.7 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, demand for potpourri was mostly seasonal. People would buy 
potpourri to add fresh scent to their homes during the winter or as holiday 
decorations. Sales fell off sharply during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
But Fanning said the potpourri business -- which competes mainly with chemical 
aerosol and non-aerosol room fresheners -- has been helped by growing 
environmental awareness. 
</P>
<P>
"People are becoming more aware of their environment and are realizing that 
aerosol, with its fluorocarbons, is damaging to the environment and plain 
unhealthy," Fanning said. "They're turning to the natural aspects of the home 
fragrance industry, where the products are biodegradable as well as 
ornamental." 
</P>
<P>
This trend has also created an opportunity for Potpourri Foundry to diversify 
into other natural scent products that can be used year round. Fanning, who 
learned about the fragrance business from his travels abroad, came up with a 
line of odor-control products called Mothbusters, a moth repellent, and Caroma, 
a car freshener. 
</P>
<P>
He has also developed a product called Odor-Defeeters, which are shoe-shaped 
bags of potpourri that are placed in stored footwear. 
</P>
<P>
Fanning expects to be a little trimmer around the waist come January. "I do a 
lot of walking around the warehouse in November and December, when we open up 
the warehouse for retail sales," said Fanning, who occasionally tugged at his 
loose-fitting pants as he strode briskly around the building, checking 
inventory and ringing up customers' purchases. "That's how I keep trim." 
</P>
<P>
Potpourri Foundry will do about 30% to 40% of its annual business during the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor helping sales this year is the economic slowdown, he said: 
Potpourri makes an inexpensive gift for cost-conscious shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Potpourri retails for about $7 per six ounces, Fanning said, though he sells it 
at his warehouse for about half that. 
</P>
<P>
Fanning started his company in his Long Beach garage six years ago after buying 
$200 worth of dried petals, spices and other ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a need for a fragrance product that was natural and environmentally 
safe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also realized early on that a good fragrance, like aroma from good food, can 
bring a sense of well-being to people. 
</P>
<P>
Fanning, who ran a Long Beach graphic-arts shop before starting Potpourri 
Foundry, likes to recall how he created his early fragrances. He used garden 
tools to mix flowers, spices, herbs and fragrance oils in a plastic bathtub in 
his garage. Working nights and weekends, he came up with a fragrance that he 
thought would sell. 
</P>
<P>
But that was 1985. Environmental awareness was not as trendy as it is now, and 
friends kidded Fanning about getting into a business that was nothing more than 
"a grown man playing with dead flowers." 
</P>
<P>
With sales now in the millions of dollars, Fanning seems to have proven them 
wrong. And besides, he said, "I'm having a great Christmas."

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday suspended trading for 10 days 
in the stock of an Irvine developer of child-care centers as part of a 
nationwide investigation into alleged market manipulation by some stockbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the investigation indicated that neither Unifirst Corp., a 
penny-stock company based in Irvine, nor its executives are presently under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
They said SEC agents are investigating a select group of brokers and the 
company's promoters for giving investors allegedly falsified financial 
statements regarding Unifirst. 
</P>
<P>
Unifirst President Wayne Wood said Friday that the problems began after his 
company agreed to merge with a Nevada shell company called Whitehall 
Development so that Unifirst could make a public offering. Unifirst developed a 
child-care center in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Unifirst employs about 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC said the trading ban will continue until Jan. 7.

BANDLEADER RECALLS DREADED BUNNY HOP; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: RAY ANTHONY AT 68 LOOKS BACK AT A LONG MUSICAL CAREER. HE'LL OPEN AT 
DISNEYLAND ON CHRISTMAS DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Lest anyone think that concert-noise problems began in the rock era, consider 
the dreaded Bunny Hop: "3,000 people pounding on the floor at one time makes a 
pretty thunderous sound, besides what it can do to the structure of the 
building," says bandleader Ray Anthony, who popularized the hopping dance in 
the early '50s. "We were recently asked to do it in Santa Cruz, but we didn't 
dare. We were on the second or third floor, and we didn't know what was holding 
the building together after the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony's 1952 recording of "The Bunny Hop" became the biggest hit in a 50-year 
career that includes more than 100 album releases, and it still sells between 
5,000 and 10,000 copies a year, he reports. The 68-year-old trumpeter begins a 
six-day engagement at Disneyland's Carnation Plaza on Christmas day and won't 
feel slighted at all if no one requests the tune. 
</P>
<P>
"That's because there's nothing to it," he said, reached by phone recently at 
his Beverly Hills home. "The music is not very inventive. It's just a very 
simple riff that would fit the dance. So you do get tired of it, just the way 
most bands get tired of playing 'In the Mood,' but the demand is still 
fantastic, so you have to play it." 
</P>
<P>
At age 18, Anthony began two years of as a member of "In the Mood" originator 
Glenn Miller's band. Though Miller's sound was to have a significant influence 
on Anthony's own bands, the two, to quote George T. Simon's "The Big Bands" 
jazz history, "never hit it off especially well." 
</P>
<P>
Simon "knew what he was talking about when he said that," Anthony agreed. 
"Glenn Miller fired me twice. I was 18 years old when I joined him and he was 
at his peak, so he wasn't about to put up with some young upstart. The reason 
he rehired me after he fired me the first time was that I obviously did a job 
for that band. I had a lot of energy and I played lead trumpet, and when he 
fired me he heard the difference in the band, and it was just about four days 
later that he rehired me. I don't know to this day what the reasons were in his 
mind when he fired me (a second time), but sometimes enthusiasm and excitement 
can be misinterpreted." 
</P>
<P>
In the Navy during World War II, Anthony formed his own band to entertain the 
troops, which in turn voted it the hottest band in the Pacific islands. After 
the war, he started a civilian outfit which became popular while incorporating, 
he said, the sax sound of Miller's band with the trumpet sound of Harry James 
and trombone sound of Tommy Dorsey's band. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Anthony's sound became more defined by his own trumpet style, 
which was noted for a gutsy emphasis of the horn's lower register. "My 
musicians sometimes kid me that the high register on my trumpet is still brand 
new," he said with a laugh. In further describing his sound, he said, "I always 
like to think that I play a melodic kind of jazz rather than just putting out a 
lot of notes and energy. I like to feel that I play a very warm, emotional type 
of ballad." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever he does, it pulls in a loyal following. Anthony said that a number of 
hard-core fans invariably see him every night of his regular week-long 
Disneyland engagements, arriving hours before show time to secure seats. "And 
to do that at the ages of some of these people, that's really a tribute," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his old-time fans, Anthony pulls in younger listeners with the sound 
of his music, making for an age spread that's also reflected on his bandstand. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest member of his 18-piece outfit is 78-year-old alto sax legend Marshal 
Royal, and the band also includes Anthony's brother, Leo, and other members who 
go back several decades with him. Others are vets of the bands of Count Basie, 
Harry James, Tommy Dorsey, Miller, Woody Herman and Buddy Rich. Anthony said 
there is also no shortage of good young players available to swing bands. 
</P>
<P>
His group regularly features a number of 30-ish players, including Orange 
County saxman Eric Marienthal, who also has a steady gig with Chick Corea and a 
successful solo career (Marienthal isn't expected to make the Disneyland 
shows). "Eric is sensational. To find a guy as good as he is at our kind of 
music as well as at everything in the current crop of music -- obviously what 
he does with Chick Corea is not what he does with us -- he's an example of the 
more outstanding young players." 
</P>
<P>
Citing the new listeners that Linda Ronstadt brought to big-band music with her 
Nelson Riddle-orchestrated albums and the recent success of Harry Connick Jr., 
Anthony thinks the big-band scene is looking brighter than it has in many 
years. He also has played no small part in increasing its audience. A decade 
ago he formed "Big Bands '80s," an operation run out of his home that is 
dedicated to promoting the music. He claims it has greatly increased the amount 
of radio play that big-band music receives, and Anthony now has a sizable 
cottage industry on his hands, making the often hard-to-find music available to 
listeners by mail order. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got up to about 1,000 stations playing big-band music as part of their 
format now. Then the people that heard those programs wanted to buy records and 
the shops weren't carrying big band music to any extent. Most stores only had a 
small area for it, and the people that enjoyed the music wouldn't go into those 
stores, because they were being handled by young kids who knew more about rock 
'n roll. So we thought we'd start a sort of one-stop (record distributor) where 
they could get just that particular type of product. We started with a couple 
of shelves and cabinets, and now we have our whole studio enveloped in compact 
discs, LPs, cassettes and what have you." 
</P>
<P>
Tired of dealing with youth-bent record labels that would rather "gamble to 
sell either millions or nothing than take a sure shot at selling 200,000 
albums," Anthony instead releases his albums on his own label, Aero Space 
Records. He recently issued a CD, "Swing Back to the '40s," that contains 19 
standards of the era. 
</P>
<P>
In his heyday, Anthony also was in a number of films (including some with 
current Newport Beach resident Mamie Van Doren, to whom he was married for 
three years) and several television programs. He bore a strong resemblance to 
Cary Grant then, and he says he still keeps in shape. He never drank or smoked, 
and has an unforgiving method of keeping himself on track: "My bathroom is 
completely mirrored, so I can see what I look like all the time. That keeps you 
aware of yourself, and I think as a result of that you just don't overeat or 
over-do." 
</P>
<P>
His lip, he says, is in top shape, and, "fortunately for me, I'm the leader, 
and if anything goes wrong, I can just point to one of the guys and say 'Take 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's good that he's so fit, since Anthony has no plans of leaving music. "Until 
death do us part, I guess, because anyone who has retired in show business, 
particularly the musical part, has regretted it. Remember when Frank Sinatra 
retired? After one year, he couldn't stand it any longer, and as you can see, 
he's still going now and he's celebrating his 75th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as you're able to keep doing it, I don't think there's any point in 
retiring. I know in my early days I thought I'd retire at 30, then it's 40, 
then 50, and after that, you just sort of say 'Forget it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ray Anthony and his orchestra appear Tuesday through Sunday Disneyland's 
Carnation Plaza, 1313 S. Harbor Blvd., Anaheim. Shows nightly at 7, 8, 9:40 and 
10:30 p.m. Tickets: $27.50 general, $22.50 for children 3 to 11 (park admission 
includes all rides). Information: (714) 999-4565.

VETERAN ROCK DEEJAY FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael (Machine Gun) Kelly, a longtime fixture on the Southern California rock 
radio scene now at KODJ-FM, has filed for bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
The Dana Point resident has had several film roles, including a priest in "The 
Enforcer," one of Clint Eastwood's "Dirty Harry" movies, a venal deejay in 
Barbra Streisand's remake of "A Star Is Born" and an appearance in "The Buddy 
Holly Story." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly listed assets of $51,000 (in the form of a $43,000 1991 Jaguar and 
household furnishings) and debts of nearly $2 million for himself and his Music 
Street Productions. Kelly cited a recent divorce for his financial 
difficulties, but said that with his acting career, radio show and his rock 
band's forthcoming album, "things are on the way up." MARK I. PINSKY

FACES . . . : OPHELIA IS NO PASSIVE WIMP, HELENA BONHAM-CARTER BELIEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helena Bonham-Carter was a bit wary when director Franco Zeffirelli cast her as 
the tragic Ophelia opposite Mel Gibson's melancholy Dane in Shakespeare's 
"Hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Franco would try to make me into this decorative thing," the petite 
British actress explains. "But, in fact, he sort of allowed me to make her a 
strong character. She can be quite wimpy and passive. There is no space these 
days to play Ophelia too passive or too obedient or too vapid. She has to have 
spirit and character." 
</P>
<P>
Bonham-Carter, who previously appeared in "Lady Jane" and "Room With a View," 
is annoyed with audiences' usual reaction to Ophelia. "They want to dismiss 
her," she says. "There's not much compassion or respect for her. She is done a 
disservice and I wanted to champion her." 
</P>
<P>
The actress believes Ophelia goes mad because she is not allowed to have any 
sexual feelings. "Then Hamlet dumps on her all of these feelings about his 
mother," she says. "If Hamlet had said, 'I got a bit of a problem,' it would 
have been great. He and Ophelia would have been able to talk about it. Instead, 
Ophelia thinks it's all her fault -- Hamlet's madness and his rejection of her 
and his killing her father. She can just imagine it's over her. I think it 
would be great to rewrite the play from Ophelia's point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Ophelia's death scene took four days to film. "I didn't have any lines because 
I was dead, but it was difficult to stay still," Bonham-Carter quips. It was 
also difficult not to laugh. "I didn't laugh until it was my close-up. I had 
been lying there for four days and they had almost forgotten about me. Then 
Franco put the cameras on me and then he decides to have a wind blowing across 
my face. That was created by Franco blowing across me like a cherub. There's a 
term called 'corpsing' in the business and that is when you break down in 
uncontrollable giggles. I gave new meaning to the word."SUSAN KING

CBS CANCELS CANNELL DRAMAS 'BROKEN BADGES,' 'WISEGUY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
CBS has canceled its two Stephen J. Cannell crime dramas, "Broken Badges" and 
"Wiseguy," and will fill the 9-11 p.m. Saturday slot with movies and special 
programming through January, a network spokesman confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Wiseguy" -- which returned to the CBS schedule Nov. 10 with Steven Bauer 
replacing Ken Wahl in the lead role -- had its last broadcast Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Broken Badges," a new series that joined the lineup Nov. 24, will have its 
last scheduled broadcast tonight, although the network said that it has two 
completed "Badges" episodes that may air later. 
</P>
<P>
"Wiseguy" was threatened with cancellation after its first low-rated episode 
this season, when CBS delayed production pending an improvement in the ratings. 
Since then, the network had offered no comment on the status of the show. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated development, the daytime version of "Wheel of Fortune," which 
switched from NBC to CBS 18 months ago, will return to NBC effective Jan. 11, 
replacing "Let's Make a Deal" at 10 a.m. CBS had already announced that it 
would drop "Wheel" to make room for "Barbara DeAngelis," a talk program 
featuring the local media therapist. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's Make a Deal," which has aired off and on for 28 years, will go out of 
production, NBC said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's Make a Deal," hosted and co-created by Monty Hall, made its debut on NBC 
in December, 1962, where it ran for five years, moving from daytime to prime 
time in 1967. It then moved to ABC, where it aired in prime time for eight 
years. From 1971 to 1976, the program went into syndication; re-runs were still 
airing in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
NBC revived the show last July with a new host, Bob Hilton, and Hall as 
producer. Hall returned in the fall as host. DIANE HAITHMAN

NUTS &amp; BOLTS / PATRICK MOTT: POINSETTIAS BRIGHTEN SEASONS ALL YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you think all that stuff about the Bermuda Triangle is just a clever 
marketing ploy to get you to buy yet another set of Time-Life books that you'll 
never read, you might want to take a minute to consider the poinsettia. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, they're everywhere. They're taking up thousands of little pots in 
dozens of shopping malls, ringing the bases of hundreds of big corporate 
Christmas trees, lining the steps of thousands of church altars. This week, the 
world is ablaze with poinsettias. 
</P>
<P>
So how come you never see a poinsettia in mid-January? Where do they go? Are 
they stolen by trolls? Are they eaten by reindeer? Or are they manufactured by 
some chemistry whiz who has managed to produce a plant that will dutifully 
vaporize after one month? 
</P>
<P>
The more likely explanation is that people manage to kill them off by the 
millions every year, one at a time, through the sure-fire expedient of neglect 
bolstered by the belief that the poinsettia is some sort of hothouse plant more 
delicate than a $10,000 tropical orchid that will crumble into crinkly, parched 
dust anyway. So they wait until the plant starts to look like the "after" 
picture on a box of weed killer and they chuck it down the trash chute. 
</P>
<P>
To these folks, the idea of a poinsettia living through the Fourth of July 
might seem about as plausible as Spike Lee wearing Florsheim wingtips. But the 
people at the Paul Ecke Poinsettia Ranch in Encinitas say you can maintain a 
poinsettia through the dog days, right on past Halloween and Thanksgiving and 
on into next Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
And they should know. They're the largest grower of poinsettias in the country. 
The Ecke Ranch grows more than 80 different sizes, shapes and colors of the 
plant in 35 acres of greenhouses. They estimate that more than 90% of all 
flowering poinsettia plants produced in the world get their start at the 
Encinitas ranch. 
</P>
<P>
So when they tell me that with a little care and vigilance I can have the same 
poinsettia on my coffee table next year, in full flower, I believe them. There 
are several steps involved, but they're fairly easy to remember because, 
according to the Ecke people, most correspond to holidays. It works like this: 
</P>
<P>
The modern poinsettia, according to the instructions, will retain its bright 
leaves (called bracts) for many weeks, longer, undoubtedly, than many people 
expect. All that's needed during its flowering time is regular watering (every 
three to four days) and the regular and moderate use of a fertilizer in dry, 
liquid, pill or stick form at the rate recommended on the package. If you care 
for the flowering plant properly, you'll start to notice side shoots beginning 
to develop in January. Cut the fading bracts back on St. Patrick's Day (March 
17) and continue the schedule of watering and fertilizing. By Memorial Day (May 
30), the Ecke Ranch folks say your plant may have developed into a mature 
height of 2 to 3 feet with several branches and large leaves. 
</P>
<P>
This is the time to repot the plant into a larger container and move it 
outdoors for the summer. Cut back all the shoots to 6 inches on the Fourth of 
July to promote the development of more side branches, all the time continuing 
to water and fertilize the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Day begins the homestretch. Move your poinsettia inside at that time and 
give it at least 6 hours of direct light in a sunny window without curtains. 
</P>
<P>
About a month later, on Columbus Day, darkness becomes important. For the 
bracts and the tiny yellow flowers to develop, the plant needs at least 6 hours 
of bright light each day, followed by at least 12 hours in absolute darkness at 
a maximum night temperature of 65 degrees. So, starting Oct. 12, plan on moving 
the plant around a lot. It takes eight to 10 weeks for the bracts to develop 
their full holiday lushness. 
</P>
<P>
(Important note if you have children or pets: poinsettias are toxic if they're 
ingested. If eaten in large amounts, they can cause severe stomach pains.) 
</P>
<P>
You can also cut back the plant any time during its growing season to control 
its size. You should make the last pruning in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
You can grow plants from the cuttings by rooting them in a pot filled with 
potting soil after dusting the base of the cutting with a rooting powder. 
Insert the cuttings into the soil, water them well and place the pot and the 
cuttings into a large polyethylene bag. 
</P>
<P>
Seal the bag and put it in a brightly lit area with a surrounding temperature 
of 65 to 70 degrees. Roots will begin to form in 14 to 18 days. Punch holes in 
the bag when the cuttings begin to grow. When the plant begins to mature, the 
bag can be removed. 
</P>
<P>
And, if you like, you can put them into the ground as a bedding plant, along 
with the other annuals in your garden. The care for a bedding poinsettia is the 
same as for a potted one. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, of course, is going to follow this advice, and the Ecke Ranch 
probably counts on that. If everyone painstakingly kept alive every poinsettia 
they had ever been given, they would start sprouting out of the roof tiles. 
</P>
<P>
But give it a try, this year anyway. If only for the sheer fun of getting to 
tell people who drop over for a little lemonade during Indian summer next 
October that the plant you have tucked away in your light-tight darkroom -- the 
one that looks as if it's been cultivated in a greenhouse for the past several 
months -- is a poinsettia. 
</P>
<P>
Tell them you learned the technique from the "Bizarre Secrets of the Ancients" 
gardening book.

"I would never become a slave to this hobby," said Fred Schrock, sitting in the 
upstairs room he had specially built for the hobby he would not be a slave to. 
"I don't eat, sleep and drink this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
So how does the longtime Santa Ana resident explain the 109 miniature 
locomotives and more than 300 railway cars he has accumulated during his 35 
years as a model railroader deluxe? 
</P>
<P>
"That is what's known as a hole in your head," he grinned. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 275,000 people in this country with similarly punctured 
craniums who collect, build and run model trains as a hobby, according to Russ 
Larson, editor of Model Railroader magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is not the model trains themselves that stun the casual observer, but 
the often elaborate track layouts designed to display them. The biggest and the 
best fill entire rooms with plaster and plastic landscapes whipped into a 
frenzy of mountains, rivers, towns and canyons. 
</P>
<P>
It is detail work on a huge scale. 
</P>
<P>
Schrock might disagree, but there is an element of empire building in the 
psychic makeup of the serious model railroader. The drive to build ever larger 
and grander layouts can be addicting. For those modelers teetering on the brink 
of fanaticism, it is a world where miniature is mighty and more is never 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
It can also be a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't do it unless I enjoyed it," said Schrock, looking over the 
room-sized layout he has been working on for 25 years. "Any person should have 
an outside interest other than their work. Model railroading can be a very 
valuable thing as a release from the pressures of making a living." 
</P>
<P>
Schrock says those pressures -- along with a lifelong interest in railroading 
-- helped lead him to the hobby when he was a public relations official for the 
electric company during the 1950s. He says he found himself coming home at 
night fed up with people and listening to complaints. Model building became an 
escape from his daily encounters with an aroused humanity. 
</P>
<P>
Model railroading did not turn into the solitary pursuit he had envisioned, 
however. As his two sons reached junior high school age, they showed a youthful 
enthusiasm for their father's expanding hobby. Sensing this opportunity, 
Schrock told the boys they could help him build his railroad -- providing they 
kept their grades up and did their homework. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, I had no trouble with the boys as far as their schoolwork was 
concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, for Schrock, model railroading was not only a salve for the pain of 
dealing with people, it proved an effective instrument of academic extortion. 
Multiple motivations are not uncommon in the world of model railroading. 
</P>
<P>
It is a hobby that thrives on variety, according to John Wissinger, president 
of the local chapter of the National Model Railroaders Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about model railroading is that you can get into it as deeply as you 
want," he said. "From a piece of plywood with some track nailed to it, to a 
basement which duplicates an actual railroad system, it can be as simple or 
elaborate as you want it to be." 
</P>
<P>
It is hardly surprising that the appeal of model railroading is usually rooted 
in a lifelong fascination with trains. But like a real railroad, the branch 
lines of the hobby can lead off in different directions. 
</P>
<P>
Some enthusiasts who like to model and collect trains don't really care for 
layout work, while others devote hundreds of hours to building realistic 
layouts, yet have no real interest in running their trains. 
</P>
<P>
Some modelers are caboose freaks. Some are "kitbashers," freethinkers who 
combine elements of two or more train kits into a hybrid original. Others are 
hooked on timetables and schedules that they use to route trains as if working 
a full-sized railroad. 
</P>
<P>
Grime is golden to an avid modeler -- fake grime, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Weatherizing a layout with paint and colored chalk dust can enhance realism. 
Mud, rust, smoke and water effects can be duplicated in a variety of splatters, 
streaks, smudges and stains -- all to scale, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The quest for realism can be a painstaking lesson in the art of minutia. 
Railway ties are often individually cut and stained from balsa wood. Shreds of 
moss, lichens and ferns are carefully crafted into bushes and trees. Tiny 
decals are applied to railway cars. 
</P>
<P>
It is a detail-driven hobby not likely to attract the nervous, the impatient or 
the clumsy. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes an ingenious slice of life is designed into a layout. One such 
innovation described in a hobby magazine was a drive-in movie that actually 
projected a film onto a miniature screen. (The trick was accomplished using a 
projector, a periscope and a system of mirrors mounted beneath the layout.) 
</P>
<P>
Such realism has its price, however. 
</P>
<P>
Vic Prior, co-owner of Discount Train Warehouse in Brea, says some people are 
reluctant to take up the hobby because of the monetary horror stories generated 
by the truly addicted. 
</P>
<P>
"People do spend thousands of dollars on this hobby," he agreed. "But that's at 
the high end. It's very much geared to what an individual can afford." 
</P>
<P>
Prior says a quality HO-scale starter setup that includes track, trains, power 
packs and control equipment can be put together for about $100. Some 
prepackaged kits cost as little as $20, although "you get what you pay for," he 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
While beginning modelers dabbling in HO scale may lust after the $300 and $400 
handmade, solid-brass locomotives he sells in his shop, Prior says quality 
plastic models are available for a tenth of the price. 
</P>
<P>
Cost is sometimes a matter of scale -- as in G, O, HO and N, which are the most 
popular train sizes available. Anyone contemplating a plunge into model mania 
must decide which scale best suits his or her tastes and needs. 
</P>
<P>
G is the behemoth of the model lines. Sometimes called the Yuppie Express, 
these milk-carton-size locomotives and cars are popular with the 
thirtysomething crowd, especially upscale homeowners who want to build garden 
layouts. To construct a realistic indoor layout using G-scale, you need only 
slightly less square footage than that of a circus tent. Engines range in price 
from $45 to more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
O, on the other hand, is the traditional, Lionel-type train layout that you got 
as a Christmas present when you were 8 years old. Sturdy and realistic, O-scale 
is also the train size most likely to be commandeered by envious fathers two 
minutes after the wrappings come off Christmas morning. 
</P>
<P>
HO is the half-sized cousin of O. Two out of every three serious model 
railroaders are HO fans, according to a survey by Model Railroader magazine. 
Highly detailed and heavily accessorized, HO is the king of custom layouts. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the shrinking trend in model train sizes is N-scale. Only about half 
the size of HO, some model railroaders joke that N stands for Nearly Not There. 
Nevertheless, the tiny trains are growing rapidly in popularity. Due to their 
compact size, complex layouts can be built in a limited space. N currently 
ranks second in market share behind HO at about 20%. 
</P>
<P>
There are several other scales -- including minuscule Z with locomotives 
roughly the size of a roll of Lifesavers -- but their combined sales make up 
only a fraction of the $210 million expected to be spent on the hobby this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to start model railroading but either don't have the time to build 
a layout or are seriously lacking in mechanical skills, pre-made layouts are 
available from several Orange County hobby shops. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Colley, owner of The Golden Spike in Irvine and a former fireman on the 
famed Durango &amp; Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad in Colorado, offers half a 
dozen pre-made layouts complete with track, trains and transformers. Colley 
says he has sold six or seven of the layouts -- which range in price from $275 
to $640 -- as special holiday orders. 
</P>
<P>
"They're compact enough to fit into some of the smaller houses in the Irvine 
area, but still have plenty of room for adding buildings and landscaping," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
From such humble beginnings are sown the seeds of a hobby that can someday fill 
an entire garage or spare bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
If you lack floor space but still want the thrill of working on a large layout, 
you might consider joining a modular railroad club. These clubs divide up the 
work of modeling by assigning small sections (often 2x4 feet) of a planned 
layout among their individual members. When the portable modules are complete, 
they are joined together into one massive, unified railscape. Sometimes dozens 
of modelers are involved in these team projects, creating layouts that could 
fill a small warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
What sort of people are attracted to a hobby such as model railroading? 
Wissinger tosses out words like "quiet" and "family-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
Prior is amused by the question. "I guess (model railroaders) are people who 
can go to a convention and not throw their drinks on the wall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys conducted by Model Railroader magazine form a composite profile of the 
typical model train fan. He is 44 years old, earns $35,000 a year, is usually 
college-educated, married and has children. He has been in model railroading 
for 20 years and spends 261 hours a year working on his hobby. He is most 
likely to share his modeling interest with a son. 
</P>
<P>
If there seems to be a strong male cast to that profile, that is because about 
98% of those pursuing the hobby are men, according to editor Russ Larson, 
although "more and more women are starting to get interested." 
</P>
<P>
Probably the greatest surge in feminine participation is coming from the 
growing ranks of husband-and-wife modeling teams. While the women are usually 
more interested in scenery and background painting than working on trains and 
equipment, Larson says their overall enthusiasm for the hobby is high. 
</P>
<P>
It is agreed that to be married and to be a modeler would be a miserable 
existence without an understanding spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Macik can no longer see the train layout built by her husband, John, in 
the garage of their Buena Park home. The 14 trestles and bridges, 10 tunnels, 
waterfall, deep river gorge, mountains, meadows, 477 feet of track, and the 
locomotives and rail cars that traverse them are all a shadowy blur to her 
since she lost most of her sight to a progressive eye disease two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But ask the former art teacher what she thinks about the miniature world 
fashioned by her husband over the past five years from plaster, paint and 
patience, and she quickly responds, "Oh, it's so beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Until her vision finally slipped away, Irene used her art knowledge to help her 
husband select colors for the layout. One of her last acts as an active artist 
was to paint three landscape murals on the garage walls to serve as backdrops. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband wanted me to paint a little town in the distance on one of the 
murals, but I couldn't see good enough to do that," she said, resting her hand 
on a corner of the layout. A cheerful woman with a quick smile, Irene says her 
husband installed special sound systems that imitate echoing train whistles, 
bells and chugging steam engines to help her enjoy the layout even though she 
can't see it. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to hear the sounds," she said. "I can hear the train coming and can 
follow it around the track." 
</P>
<P>
John says his wife still helps him with artistic matters concerning the layout. 
</P>
<P>
"She suggested that I put some colored lights on a dimmer to make it look like 
sunset," he said. "There's also a moonlight effect we can get. I'm going to 
wire (the layout) up for lights so that we can run the train as if it was 
night." 
</P>
<P>
The retired mechanic turned a knob on the control panel, adjusting the lights 
to mimic early twilight. 
</P>
<P>
"With the low lights, the train running, and the whistle and echo, you can 
really transfer yourself right into a different time and place," he said. "It's 
just like another world." 
</P>
<P>
But like the real world, it can be a transitory place. 
</P>
<P>
When a train buff makes that final run to the great modeler in the sky, he 
often leaves behind a piece of fabricated real estate too big to move, too 
individual to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't much market for used layouts," Prior says. "A lot of (widows) will 
bring in their husband's locomotives and buildings and stuff to sell, but the 
layout itself is usually torn up and thrown away." 
</P>
<P>
Many times, trains and accessories are given or sold to friends. The roundhouse 
and turntable on Macik's layout were acquired in this way. 
</P>
<P>
"My friend had a real nice layout when he died about four years ago," said 
Macik, rubbing a finger over a length of track. "His wife sold a lot of it 
piece by piece. That's how I got this train car." 
</P>
<P>
On a siding overlooking a river of blue resin sat a small, cream-colored 
boxcar. Lettered on the side were the words Apocalypse Southern. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to save it as a souvenir," Macik said, reaching over to tap the car a 
few inches down the track. "It's sort of a crazy thing to call a railroad, 
don't you think?" 
</P>

SMOKE DETECTORS ARE SOUND INVESTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From From Reader's Digest 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
News story after news story tells of fire fatalities that might have been 
prevented if smoke detectors had been in use. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke detectors make a shrill warning sound when exposed to smoke. Since they 
are relatively inexpensive and easy to install, there is no reason any home 
should be without them. 
</P>
<P>
Here's some basic information on buying and using these life-saving devices: 
</P>
<P>
Types: 
</P>
<P>
* "Ionization" detectors contain a tiny amount of shielded radioactive 
material. This material breaks air down into charged atoms through which a 
small current can flow. Smoke interrupts the flow of current, which sets off 
the alarm. An ionization detector responds more quickly to the fumes of a 
fast-burning fire. 
</P>
<P>
* "Photoelectric" detectors use a small light beam that impinges on a 
light-sensitive photocell. The alarm sounds whenever smoke interrupts the light 
beam. The light bulb producing the beam lasts about three years; then it must 
be replaced. A photoelectric type of detector gives a faster response to smoke 
from a smoldering fire. It is also less prone to false alarms from innocuous 
kitchen fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Either type of smoke detector may be powered by a battery (usually 9 volts) or 
house current. 
</P>
<P>
Effective Use: 
</P>
<P>
* Test your smoke detector about once a month to make sure it's operating 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
To test, simply press the test button on the front of the unit. The alarm (a 
continuous blare) will sound as long as the test button is depressed. This test 
automatically checks the electronic circuit, horn and battery. 
</P>
<P>
If the horn does not sound, replace the battery. If it still does not sound, 
have the detector repaired or replaced. 
</P>
<P>
* When the smoke detector battery begins to weaken, it will sound a warning 
signal (usually intermittent beeps or chirps). Replace the battery immediately 
following the manufacturer's directions. 
</P>
<P>
* Clean your smoke detectors yearly to remove dust, grease and other soil. 
</P>
<P>
Where to Locate: 
</P>
<P>
* In halls leading to sleeping areas. 
</P>
<P>
* At the heads of stairs leading to living areas. 
</P>
<P>
* In the bedroom of any smoker in your family. 
</P>
<P>
* On the same house level as your kitchen, but not too near your appliances 
since everyday cooking can easily set it off. Caution: Never turn off a smoke 
detector because you are cooking something that will cause it to sound off. 
It's too easy to forget to turn it on again. 
</P>
<P>
* Away from air currents (vents or radiators, for example), dead air corners 
and ends of halls. 
</P>
<P>
* On the ceiling at least 20 inches from all corners or walls. 
</P>
<P>
* On walls, at least 12 inches from the ceiling and the nearest corner. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Don't paint the detector. Painting clogs the holes and reduces its 
effectiveness.

YULE TREE DECORATOR HAS SEEN THE LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
I actually kept a New Year's resolution this year and I'm sorry I bothered. 
</P>
<P>
The promise was made last December just after I had spent almost two hours 
untangling Christmas tree lights from the year before, the ones I had 
unceremoniously yanked from the tree and hurled into a box. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevermore, nevermore," quoth I as I removed the tinsel, labored over the knots 
and replaced the bulbs broken by careless handling. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Christmas '89 was officially over, I oh-so-gingerly removed the lights 
from the tree, picked off tinsel and pine needles, and laid the strings out in 
a large, sturdy box. 
</P>
<P>
And it worked. This past weekend, after I had installed my tree, preparing the 
lights was a snap. They came out of their place of repose with ease and I lined 
them on the floor without a snag -- or a knot, either. 
</P>
<P>
The problem came when I tested them. One whole string of 140 lights was dark. 
(Forget that the box says, "If one goes out, the rest remain lit.") 
</P>
<P>
I tested the wire by plugging one end into the wall and the other into another 
string of lights I knew worked. The latter jumped to life, proving that 
electric current was indeed passing through. 
</P>
<P>
Off to the store for replacement bulbs, then the laborious task of finding the 
defective bulb. Starting with light No. 1 (of the 140), I patiently took each 
old one out and inserted a new bulb, then removed the new bulb and reinstalled 
the old. Light after light it went that way until I reached No. 74 and stopped 
to run out for Chinese, carefully marking the spot with a loop in the wire. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner, for no particular reason, I resumed the task at No. 140 and 
worked my way back to the tell-tale loop. As luck (my luck, anyway) would have 
it, the bad light was No. 75. There was a tiny piece of tinsel in the socket, 
which was apparently shorting out the entire string. I would, of course, have 
found it immediately after dinner had I simply picked up where I had left off. 
</P>
<P>
But that's OK, I told myself, because had I picked up at No. 75, the bad bulb 
would have been No. 140. 
</P>
<P>
No matter, there was light! All 140 bulbs shone brightly and I was sore 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Up the stepladder and round and round the tree I went, carefully planting each 
light for the best effect, some tucked inside close to the trunk, others 
dancing lightly on the ends of the limbs. 
</P>
<P>
I plugged them in and suddenly the travails of the day just didn't matter. They 
were perfect -- no gaps, symmetrically wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
For about two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Then the whole top of the tree went dark. 
</P>
<P>
"To hell with this," I said, and dragged the string out to the trash can. 
</P>
<P>
I drove to the closest drugstore, selected a box containing a string of 200 new 
lights clearly marked, "If one goes out, the rest remain lit," paid the $14.99, 
plus tax, took them home and installed them. 
</P>
<P>
I should have read the entire box. That oversight was noted by my older son 
when he appeared much later in the evening. "Hey, tree looks good," he said, 
"but I thought you hated blinking lights." 
</P>
<P>
"I do," I said, "but I thought we'd try them this one year." 
</P>
<P>
And that's the truth. When the trash man picks up that tree after Christmas, 
it's still going to have those lights on it. Next year too -- and the year 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
Where else can you buy peace of mind for $14.99?

RULING ON FREE EXERCISE ASSAILED; 
</P>
<P>
CHURCH AND STATE: A CASE INVOLVING DRUG USE IN RITUALS WAS THE SUPREME COURT'S 
BIGGEST RELIGION DECISION IN 1990. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL TURNER, RELIGIOUS NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Supreme Court ruling upholding the right of states to bar the use of drugs in 
religious rituals alarmed several advocates of church-state separation, who 
said it overturned a 27-year-old standard for applying the First Amendment 
clause guaranteeing free exercise of religion. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's April 17 ruling in the case of Oregon v. Smith was perhaps the 
best known and most controversial church-state development during 1990, a year 
that was also marked by significant rulings that upheld the federal Equal 
Access Act and struck down a challenge to the tax-exempt status of the Roman 
Catholic Church in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Religious healing and the rights of students to distribute religious literature 
in public schools were also involved in several of the year's cases. 
</P>
<P>
In its 6-3 ruling in the Oregon case, the Supreme Court said there does not 
have to be a "compelling state interest" in most cases involving the free 
exercise of religion. The "compelling state interest" test was first set forth 
in a 1963 case in which the court said the denial of state unemployment 
compensation benefits for a women who refused to work on her Sabbath imposed an 
unconstitutional burden on her exercise of religion. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the court's majority opinion, which involved the 
use of peyote by American Indians. Scalia said the First Amendment "is not 
offended" if prohibiting the exercise of religion -- in this case, the use of 
the drug -- is "merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and 
otherwise valid provision." 
</P>
<P>
Religious and civil liberty groups urged the court to reconsider. The court 
declined, then several congressmen introduced a bill, the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act, designed to restore the "compelling interest" test in such 
cases involving the "free exercise of religion." Rep. Stephen J. Solarz 
(D-N.Y.), one of the sponsors, said that "with the stroke of a pen, the Supreme 
Court virtually removed religious freedom -- our first freedom -- from the Bill 
of Rights." 
</P>
<P>
A week after issuing the Oregon decision, the court used it as a basis for 
setting aside a Minnesota Supreme Court ruling that the state's Amish people 
cannot be forced to equip their horse-drawn buggies with triangular signs 
warning of slow-moving vehicle. However, the justices asked the state court to 
reconsider the Amish case in light of the Oregon ruling, rather than issue a 
final judgment. The Minnesota court then cited a religious-freedom provision of 
the state Constitution in ruling that the Amish are exempt from the state 
traffic law. 
</P>
<P>
In an 8-1 ruling issued June 4, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality 
of the 1984 Equal Access Act, which gives high school religious clubs the same 
right to meet on school property as other non-academic extracurricular groups. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling against school officials in Omaha who refused to grant permission to a 
group of students to form a Christian Bible club to meet on a high school 
campus, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the majority that "since denial 
of such recognition is based on the religious content of the meetings 
respondents wish to conduct within the school's limited open forum, it violates 
the act." 
</P>
<P>
Although the decision reflected near unanimity, it got disparate reactions from 
religious groups that filed briefs. Some praised the ruling as a victory for 
free expression, while others said it raised the specter of extremist groups 
recruiting members in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Jay Sekulow of Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism, who represented 
the Christian students in the Omaha equal access case, said his office was 
"getting calls from all over the country, from students asking about their 
rights to evangelize and to distribute materials."

ARMED SOLDIERS -- AS ALWAYS -- AT SITE OF CHRIST'S BAPTISM

JORDAN RIVER, Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A slight breeze stirs the reeds and rushes. The water flows so slowly it seems 
still. At this tranquil curve of the Jordan, tradition has it, Jesus was 
immersed by St. John the Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
The illusion of peace is fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
Coils of barbed wire rim the river a few steps away. An Israeli army truck 
carrying three men with machine guns has led the way to the baptismal site, 
passing signs that say in English, Hebrew and Arabic: "Danger -- Mines." 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, spent his life in what has been for 
centuries a land of war. The sites of his birth, baptism and burial are on 
disputed land still fought over by Israelis and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
In Bethlehem again this year, hundreds of armed Israeli soldiers will guard the 
square surrounding the Church of the Nativity on Christmas Eve because of the 
3-year-old Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The city's mayor, Elias Freij, a Greek Orthodox Christian, has ordered 
municipal Christmas celebrations canceled for the fourth year in sympathy with 
the uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a Palestinian flag flew from the Church of the Holy 
Sepulcher, the site of Christ's burial in Jerusalem, to protest Jewish settlers 
trying to take over a hostel owned by the Greek Orthodox Church. 
</P>
<P>
Here on the Jordan, the site of Christ's baptism lies in the no-man's-land 
along the Israeli-Jordanian frontier -- beyond a fence topped with barbed wire, 
surrounded by bunkers and mines. 
</P>
<P>
The area is usually opened only twice a year: on Jan. 18, the eve of the Greek 
Orthodox Epiphany, or 12th day of Christmas, marking the revelation of Jesus as 
the Christ, and in October for a baptism ceremony by the Roman Catholic 
Franciscan order. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Israel's Tourism Ministry opened it for reporters as part of a 
pre-Christmas tour that concentrated on Christ's baptism and wanderings in the 
Judean desert. 
</P>
<P>
His journey from Galilee to the Jordan, and the baptism, are described in 
Matthew 3:13-17: "And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of 
the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of 
God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 
</P>
<P>
"And lo a voice from heaven, saying, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well 
pleased.' " 
</P>
<P>
After his baptism, Jesus went into the surrounding desert and was tempted by 
the devil for 40 days, the Bible says. The Monastery of the Temptation, on a 
cliff west of Jericho, stands where tradition says he rejected Satan's coaxing. 
</P>
<P>
To understand Christ's life in the desert, monks for hundreds of years have 
lived along the river and in the rugged hills above the Jordan Valley. Up to 
100 monasteries had been built by the time a Persian invasion destroyed them in 
the 7th Century. 
</P>
<P>
That was but one chapter in a history of war that extends from the ancient 
battles of the Philistines, Canaanites and Israelites to modern world wars and 
the five Arab-Israeli conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven monasteries stood along the Jordan near the baptismal site in recent 
times, but Israel closed the area along the bank in 1970 because of attacks 
from Jordan by Palestinians hoping to regain their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
David Bivin, a Christian biblical scholar who helped guide the reporters, said 
it was here that Jesus received the inspiration for his later life from the bat 
kol -- Hebrew for divine voice -- that spoke from the skies after his baptism. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the real mission of Jesus began in the wilderness with that 
announcement," Bivin said. 
</P>
<P>
From the Jordan, Jesus went to the desert and from there returned to Galilee to 
deliver the Sermon on the Mount, the Bible says. 
</P>
<P>
His message, in Matthew 5:9, still speaks to the land of his birth: "Blessed 
are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God."

ENVIRONMENT: GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD EXPLORE THEOLOGICAL BASIS FOR PRESERVING 
GOD'S CREATION.

<P>
As environmental issues captured the world's attention in 1990, religious 
groups brought their theological insights to the cause by focusing on the 
responsibility to preserve and protect God's creation. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, religious bodies continued their move away from classic views of 
creation that set humankind and nature against one another by stressing the 
biblical call for humans to have "dominion" over nature. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II opened the year with a message for the Jan. 1 World Day of 
Prayer for Peace in which he equated ecological destruction with contempt for 
humanity. The Pope linked disregard for nature and plundering of resources with 
a decline in the quality of life and said that decline leads to a "sense of 
precariousness and insecurity" that creates "a seedbed for collective 
selfishness, disregard for others and dishonesty." 
</P>
<P>
Later in January, religious and scientific leaders from around the world 
gathered in Moscow and issued a statement calling for joint commitment toward 
"preserving and cherishing the earth" and a plan of action to forge a 
"fundamental change in attitudes and practices that have pushed our world to a 
perilous brink." 
</P>
<P>
Among the religious traditions represented were Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, 
Islamic, Jainist, Jewish, Shintoist, Sikh and indigenous faiths. 
</P>
<P>
William Reilly, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, spoke 
frequently of the need to articulate a new "spiritual vision" of conservation 
and stewardship. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing a group of Catholic leaders in Washington in January, Reilly urged 
them to articulate a "clear ethical foundation" for efforts to protect the 
environment. And in May, at a Washington gathering on "Caring for Creation," he 
said, "We must go beyond compulsion, laws and incentives. We must engage the 
heart, which is not reached by appeals to law or science." 
</P>
<P>
Delegates to a World Council of Churches gathering in Seoul, South Korea, March 
5-13 linked issues of justice and peace with preservation of creation. Although 
the gathering failed to adopt the theological section of a World Council 
document called "Between the Flood and the Rainbow," officials of the 
ecumenical organization said the document had fulfilled one of its major 
purposes -- to inspire theological discussion about major threats to life on 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The religious community was involved at the grass-roots level in observing 
Earth Day 1990 on April 22, as demonstrated by requests from more than 2,000 
congregations for a "religious resource packet" provided by the North American 
Conference on Religion and Ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Diane E. Sherwood, communications director for the conference in Washington, 
said that in contrast to Earth Day 1970, environmentalists in 1990 were "very 
aware of the importance of getting the churches involved" and had come to 
recognize that "without religion, those people concerned about the environment 
will not turn into a majority." 
</P>
<P>
The Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility reported in April that 
activists in the religious community were increasingly devoting more attention 
to the environment, filing a record 38 shareholder resolutions on environmental 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Center Director Tim Smith predicted that the environment will be the leading 
social concern of the 1990s, noting what he called an "unprecedented concern 
about the future of the planet." 
</P>
<P>
In June, Presbyterians meeting at the denomination's General Assembly declared 
"restoring creation as a central concern of the church, to be incorporated into 
its life and mission at every level." 
</P>
<P>
The Presbyterians adopted a major paper entitled "Restoring Creation for 
Ecology and Justice" which called for creation of a new General Assembly office 
and program on environmental justice and stewardship and inclusion of 
eco-justice perspectives throughout the church's mission and ministry units. 
</P>
<P>
Mainline denominations were not the only church bodies to join the cause in 
1990. The Seventh-day Adventist Church adopted a statement on care of the Earth 
at its World Conference held in July in Indianapolis. "The environmental crisis 
is not simply economic and political. It is also moral and spiritual, for it 
impinges on our relationship to our creator as stewards of his creation," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The Annual Conference of the Church of the Brethren, one of the nation's 
historic "peace" churches, approved a discussion paper in July that said, "As 
Christians, we can reform our theology and contribute to society a new 
appreciation for the sacredness of all creation. Individually and collectively, 
we can change the way we live so that instead of destroying the earth we can 
help it to thrive, today and for future generations. . . . As a church, are we 
ready to commit ourselves to this challenge?"

THE ONLY AGREEMENT ON CRIME: NO EASY ANSWERS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: OFFICIALS PAINT A BLEAK FUTURE FOR THE SHORT TERM, DIFFER ON 
POSSIBLE LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With narcotics use rampant, the gap between haves and have-nots will widen as 
crime and violence swell. Class conflict will engulf Los Angeles, pitting the 
able against those debilitated by drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
This is 1995 as Sheriff Sherman Block envisions it. 
</P>
<P>
"When the people reach a point where they realize that the government cannot 
provide them safety," Block said, "they're going to take that responsibility 
unto themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Such a bleak picture is hardly the sheriff's alone. Many other authorities 
contend that the criminal justice system, overloaded and overwhelmed, is caught 
in a tailspin from which it cannot recover -- at least in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we going to change anything in five or 10 years? The answer is no," said 
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. "There is no short-term resolution to the underlying 
decay that has been going on for so long." 
</P>
<P>
The question, then, is how the criminal justice system in the long run can both 
deter people who would break the law and handle more effectively those who 
already have? 
</P>
<P>
The solutions, experts suggest, may be as complex as national economics, as 
esoteric as acupuncture or as simple as teaching a child to say no to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Much of what explains the plight of criminal justice today lies beyond the 
police and courts, authorities are quick to point out. The growing number of 
single-parent households, violence on television, reduced funding for social 
and recreational programs in the inner-city -- all are said to contribute in 
varying degrees to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"So many young people grow up today without a conscience, without a moral 
compass" said City Atty. James K. Hahn. "They're like Pinocchio without Jiminy 
Cricket. You can't expect police, prosecutors, judges and jailers to fix that." 
</P>
<P>
Another theory holds that economics largely determines the course of crime. 
Should economic conditions worsen, some academicians believe, there will be 
greater incentive for poor people to rob and steal. 
</P>
<P>
Still others suggest that the age of the population dictates the rise and fall 
of crime. Their premise is that young people commit more than their share of 
unlawful acts. That, they say, helps explain why violence soared in the 1960s 
and 1970s, as post-World War II baby boomers entered the peak age group for 
committing crime -- mid-teens to early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
With the children of baby boomers now reaching their teens, the nation should 
brace for a new crime wave -- or so the premise goes. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, we're now in almost a lull," said criminologist Alfred Blumstein 
of Pittsburgh's Carnegie-Mellon University, among the theory's leading 
advocates. "It's not as bad as it's going to be when we really get into the 
'90s." 
</P>
<P>
These and similar predictions come at a time when Californians have shown a 
resolve to fight crime with tough new laws but appear disinclined to foot the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
Witness the November elections: With law enforcement officials pleading for 
more resources, voters in Los Angeles overwhelmingly rejected every state and 
local initiative that would have raised funds for new jails and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no great golden pot at the end of the rainbow," said Robert S. 
Mimura, executive director of the Los Angeles Countywide Criminal Justice 
Coordinating Committee. "If we achieve anything, it's going to have to be with 
a reallocation of resources, making the system more efficient than it is. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
A panacea to the ills that plague criminal justice today does not exist, Mimura 
and others stress. There is, however, no shortage of recommendations, 
experiments and innovations to consider. 
</P>
<P>
Here are but a few: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, no other issue has had a more significant impact on the criminal 
justice system than the proliferation of street drugs and drug-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Of all adult felony arrests made last year in Los Angeles County, 56% were for 
drug law violations, according to California Department of Justice figures. 
About seven out of every 10 people arrested in Los Angeles today, from traffic 
offenders to suspected murderers, have narcotics in their blood at the time, 
judges and police say. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers, including former U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, 
columnist William F. Buckley and economist Milton Friedman, have publicly 
suggested the "decriminalization" of drugs. Aggressive enforcement of anti-drug 
laws, they and others believe, have only prompted narcotics-related crimes and 
jammed court dockets, while inhibiting cocaine and heroin addicts who might 
otherwise seek rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Few, if any, local authorities are willing to publicly advocate the 
legalization of drugs, but some suggest privately that there may be no other 
recourse to reduce the pressures that are straining the criminal justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Short of legalization, the best way to lighten the loads of police, prosecutors 
and judges, many believe, is to reduce consumer demand for crack cocaine and 
other narcotics. This strategy underpins Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) 
and other programs in which police help teach school-aged children how to avoid 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Launched by the Los Angeles Police Department in 1983, DARE programs have 
spread to 3,500 law enforcement agencies in all 50 states. Recent nationwide 
surveys have shown that drug use among high school students, after more than 
doubling between 1975 and 1988, has declined in the last two years, but 
authorities say it may be too soon to know whether anti-drug education is 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, court officials believe that they have found a truly viable solution 
to drug abuse -- use of acupuncture on addicts. 
</P>
<P>
People arrested in Miami for the first time on drug possession charges are 
given the option of going to court and facing jail or attending a year of 
outpatient counseling and treatment, the key aspect of which is having needles 
regularly inserted in each of their ears. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to lessen the craving for crack cocaine," said Judge Herbert M. 
Klein, who devised the program. "It quiets the person down, makes them more 
amenable to treatment." 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,400 arrestees have completed the treatment since June, 1989, when 
the program began, or are presently enrolled. Only about 3%, Klein said, have 
been rearrested on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gangs 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, there were an estimated 45,000 gang members in Los Angeles County. 
Today, there are 90,000. Despite a myriad of get-tough efforts by police, 
street gangs are not only growing in number but in violence: more than one out 
of every three homicides countywide are gang-related today compared to one in 
10 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
If forceful law enforcement does not deter street hoodlums, what will? 
Grudgingly, but increasingly, police officials say that the solution also must 
incorporate better schools, recreational opportunities, counseling programs and 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Law enforcement (alone) cannot break the cycle," Block said, "only social 
improvements can break it." 
</P>
<P>
Many sociologists point to the late 1970s and cutbacks in government-funded 
programs when offering explanations of why gangs in Los Angeles have 
proliferated. With limited educational and employment opportunities, they 
contend, many young people have joined gangs for lack of anything else to 
occupy their time. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale roundups of suspected gang members, most notably the Los Angeles 
Police Department's recurrent "Operation Hammer," have only worsened the 
situation, some say, because arrests often are followed with little or no jail 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"These people," Block said, "often are right back on the street more cocky than 
ever with the system's inability to handle them." 
</P>
<P>
The social improvements that Block proposes come with a hefty price tag. With 
increasingly tight fiscal constraints, some Los Angeles officials say that 
funds might be derived from California Lottery proceeds, telethons or private, 
fund-raising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Others, including Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman, have suggested that 
programs to pacify gangs might best come from the budgets of police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"Since law enforcement is failing in this war," Edelman said recently, "we need 
to put money into imaginative social programs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Police 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles needs more police officers, according to Chief Daryl F. Gates -- 
not necessarily because of crime but because the criminal justice system is 
failing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a situation in Los Angeles I couldn't handle right now 
if I had the jails," said Gates. 
</P>
<P>
His officers could make many more arrests, he said, "but I don't want to load 
up the system." 
</P>
<P>
The "hue and cry" among many citizens for more police could prove 
"self-defeating," Gates said, because more officers would produce more arrests, 
even further overwhelming the courts and jails. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Gates said he believes that additional officers would improve "the 
kind of service we think (Los Angeles residents) ought to get. People shouldn't 
have to put up with the car being stolen or broken into, but we reach a point 
where we are unable to deal with the mass of calls -- it just keeps going up 
and up and up." 
</P>
<P>
Could harder work by present members of the department or an increase in 
departmental strength reduce crime? 
</P>
<P>
A 1967 study by the President's Crime Commission estimated that a police 
officer on routine patrol in Los Angeles could expect to detect a burglary in 
progress once every three months and happen upon a robbery every 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
After the number of patrol cars were doubled and tripled during a 1973 
experiment in some areas of Kansas City, Mo., researchers concluded that, 
"routine . . . patrol in marked cars has little value in preventing crime." 
</P>
<P>
Such studies, experts say, demonstrate the limitations of law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"We -- police officials, government leaders, citizens, all of us -- would do 
well to abandon our quixotic faith that there is a police solution to the 
problem of criminal violence," wrote criminologist Charles E. Silberman in his 
1978 treatise, "Criminal Violence, Criminal Justice." 
</P>
<P>
Short of creating a police state, putting more officers on the street would not 
make a measureable dent in street crime, according to Silberman and others. 
</P>
<P>
More could be achieved, they say, through closer interaction between civilians 
and the police. 
</P>
<P>
Most crimes, in fact, are not solved by detectives sifting through evidence, 
but by ordinary citizens who come forward with information that leads police to 
a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"Members of the public have a critical role to play in crime control," San Jose 
Police Chief Joseph McNamara has said. "They are far more likely to play that 
role if the cop is someone they know and like, instead of his being a brusque, 
aloof, stranger." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Juvenile Justice 
</P>
<P>
By the time most criminals are sent to prison for burglary, robbery or worse, 
they already have been arrested and convicted for crimes committed as 
juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the first arrest usually ends with the juvenile being 
admonished by police officers and released. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested and convicted after that, he will probably be granted probation and 
ordered to stay home under parental supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested and convicted again, he may spend a few weeks in a juvenile hall or 
work camp. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested and convicted a fourth time, he might be committed to the California 
Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
When he reaches adulthood, authorities say, it may be too late to change his 
criminal ways by sending him to prison. 
</P>
<P>
"The juvenile system is operating backwards," said D.A. Reiner. "You don't 
stake a tree when it is already grown and twisted, but when it is a sapling. 
The juvenile justice system affirmatively creates habitual criminals even as it 
is trying to be compassionate." 
</P>
<P>
The concept of leniency extended to young offenders, Reiner and other critics 
contend, enforces criminal behavior by essentially teaching offenders that the 
system will tolerate all but the most heinous crimes. 
</P>
<P>
A long-term study released this year by the state Task Force to Promote 
Self-Esteem stressed that youths should be punished with a "reasonable sanction 
to every criminal act, regardless of how minor." 
</P>
<P>
Forcing a youngster to face the consequences of his criminal actions, the study 
concluded, would make him more accountable, enhance his self-esteem and deter 
him from future criminal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we get very serious about these people, they have developed a 
pattern or lifestyle of criminal behavior that is difficult to break," said 
Sheriff Block. "We have to do it quicker and with greater certainty." 
</P>
<P>
There already may be steps toward that end. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Boland, Los Angeles County's presiding juvenile judge, pointed out that 
the number of criminal petitions filed in court countywide against juveniles 
has risen from 29,000 in 1988 to 35,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Boland said, the percentage of juvenile offenders ordered 
home on probation has declined while percentages have increased for those sent 
to county-run camps or to the California Youth Authority -- the juvenile 
equivalent of prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Courts 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors commonly complain that one reason they must plea bargain with 
criminals is that there are not enough courtrooms to try them all. 
</P>
<P>
But most courtrooms are under-utilized in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, many courts operate well into the night. In Los Angeles County, 
only three of about 100 criminal courtrooms are open after 5 p.m. All three are 
in the Criminal Courts Building downtown, where nearly 20% of California's 
felony crimes are adjudicated, and are used almost exclusively for prosecuting 
low-level drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
Those opposed to it, many judges among them, insist that expanding night court 
operations would not be cost-effective. It would also, they insist, 
inconvenience and possibly endanger jurors who would be required to venture out 
after dark. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, some judges say that they oppose night courts because it would 
inconvenience them and require that they share their chambers with judges 
assigned the night shift. 
</P>
<P>
While many Superior Court judges adhere to rigorous work schedules, others do 
not. A few assigned to the Criminal Courts Building are rarely in chambers or 
on the bench before 9:30 a.m., frequently take two-hour lunch breaks and are 
gone by 4 p.m., according to judges and attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoons, the corridors of the courthouse are deserted as many 
judges get early starts on their weekends. The Times checked downtown 
courtrooms of all Superior Court judges assigned to criminal matters on random 
Friday afternoons throughout 1990. On average, nearly half were closed by 2 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Other authorities contend that court performance could be improved by limiting 
"continuances," in which judges agree to put off hearings, trials and 
sentencings at the request of attorneys. A recent study by County Clerk Frank 
S. Zolin found that in a three-month period in 1988, Superior Court judges 
granted 22,717 continuances without following procedures intended to limit such 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
"The snail's pace of many cases is not because of resources," D.A. Reiner said, 
"but because of attitude. Aside from the statute of limitations, no deadline 
(in court) is taken seriously. Prosecutors are just as much to blame, but 
judges are even more to blame." 
</P>
<P>
Judges, however, offer statistics showing that they are processing more 
criminal cases than ever and moving them through the system at record pace -- 
usually by accepting plea bargains that have been negotiated sooner. Speed is 
essential because for every defendant sent to prison or released on probation, 
there is more jail space for new arrestees. 
</P>
<P>
To further speed cases through the system, a court executive committee 
announced just this week that criminal court judges will soon begin proceedings 
one-half hour early, at 8:30 a.m., to expedite the flow of cases. 
</P>
<P>
"The judges already are doing an heroic job in a thankless situation," said 
Presiding Judge Richard Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prosecutorial Discretion 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, longtime Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury has a "no plea 
bargain" policy. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say all criminal cases in Ventura County are settled by juries. 
</P>
<P>
It means that prosecutors are more selective in choosing the charges they file 
in each case. Once a charge is filed, a defendant is told that he must plead 
guilty to that charge or go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County prosecutors then leave it up to the judge to decide the 
appropriate sentence, rather than agreeing upon a sentence and having the 
judge, in effect, rubber stamp the agreement -- the way virtually all Superior 
Court cases are settled in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy, Ventura County prosecutors say, produces tougher punishment. 
According to the state Board of Prison Terms, the median prison sentence 
imposed in Ventura County for all crimes is 48 months, compared to 28 months in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Before Ventura County's methods could begin to work in Los Angeles, experts 
say, prosecutors assigned to the county's 11 courthouses would first have to 
reach a consensus on what charges to file for various types of offenses. For 
instance, should a robber who was armed with a gun be charged with "armed with 
a firearm," punishable by up to three years in prison, or "personal use of a 
firearm," punishable by up to five years? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if you could impose that kind of system in Los Angeles simply 
because it is so large," said Gary Mullen, executive director of the California 
Dist. Atty.'s Assn. "It's not like one big office. There are almost separate 
cultures office-to-office on what a crime is worth." 
</P>
<P>
The caseload of prosecutors in Los Angeles today may also preclude adopting 
Ventura County's hard-line approach to negotiating pleas, Mullen added. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Luis Obispo, if you've committed one petty theft and you commit another 
one, they regularly charge that as a felony," Mullen said. "If you tried that 
in Los Angeles as a felony, you'd have gridlock tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jails and Alternatives 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, Los Angeles County's population is expected to reach 9.6 
million. The county's jail population, meanwhile, is projected to climb to 
nearly 44,000 -- double the number of men and women presently incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
Already the Sheriff's Department each month must let loose thousands of 
convicted criminals before they have finished their sentences to make room for 
the newly arrested. 
</P>
<P>
There are only about 23,000 beds in the county's jail system and under a 
federal court order, no more can be added without expanding existing facilities 
or building new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Locking up all the customers . . . can't be done," said Mark A. Cuniff, 
executive director of the National Assn. of Criminal Justice Planners. "Society 
is not willing to pay the bill." 
</P>
<P>
Others, including Chief Gates, believe that additional facilities to house 
criminals must be built. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to construct them to last into the 22nd Century . . . but we do 
need to build them," Gates said. " . . . We've got to get over this nonsense 
that building prisons and jails is an endless task. There is a finite number of 
people who commit crime and if we can take care of them . . . crime will level 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Gates suggested that instead of building new facilities, officials might 
consider converting existing structures, such as "Air Force bases in the 
desert," to house law breakers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the San Joaquin Valley believe they have found another, less 
expensive, alternative to building more jails. 
</P>
<P>
Since December, 1989, judges in Madera County have ordered more than 150 
lawbreakers, including convicted felons, to serve their sentences at home 
rather than in the county's jail. 
</P>
<P>
To make sure the lawbreaker is at home when he is supposed to be (most are 
permitted to work or attend school), a computer monitor and special telephone 
equipment have been installed in each residence. A central computer at the 
Madera County Parole Department then telephones each home, sometimes as often 
as four random times throughout the day and night. 
</P>
<P>
After answering the phone, the person is instructed to look into the computer 
monitor and strike one of more than a dozen different poses. His image is then 
transmitted to the parole department, where officers confirm that the picture 
and the lawbreaker are one in the same. 
</P>
<P>
Daulton Wisener, who supervises the computer program, said it costs $5.25 a day 
per person to run it. It costs $45 a day, he noted, to keep an inmate in Madera 
County's jail. 
</P>
<P>
Other counties, including Los Angeles, have limited electronic home detention 
programs, in which people convicted of crimes wear ankle or wrist transmitters 
that alert authorities when they have left home, but the equipment is often 
prone to break down, according to Wisener and others. 
</P>
<P>
"This," he said of Madera County's program, "is the wave of the future." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Probation 
</P>
<P>
There may be little to improve general probation supervision in Los Angeles 
County without a major infusion of funds to hire more probation officers, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
By California law, the probation department must prepare pre-sentence reports 
on all defendants convicted in Superior Court. But the department is under no 
legal obligation to provide supervision to all defendants once they are 
released on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Some probation officers believe that to maintain any semblance of supervision, 
given present budget constraints, they must concentrate supervision on only the 
most dangerous felons. 
</P>
<P>
Still others contend that it is only a matter of time before the probation 
department gets out of the supervision business altogether. It is, said 
Probation Administrator Carol Koelle, "inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
To fill whatever void may be left, Gates has proposed that the police supervise 
criminals who have been released on probation. 
</P>
<P>
The probation department's mission, Gates believes, should be directed toward 
keeping young offenders from becoming full-blown criminals, leaving supervision 
of hardened felons to police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gates' plan, individuals on probation would be required to carry special 
identification cards. Failure to carry or provide the card to a police officer 
upon demand would result in arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of probation would be computerized and available to officers whenever 
they stopped a probationer on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time," Gates said, "we put the authority for enforcing the conditions of 
probation where it belongs -- with police officers who witness the probation 
violations firsthand." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll: The Future 
</P>
<P>
In the coming decade, Los Angeles' criminal justice system will decline or 
remain the same but will not improve, say an overwhelming majority of police, 
prosecutors, public defenders, probation officers and Superior Court judges 
surveyed by the Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the system's future ability to administer "swift and sure" 
justice, only Municipal Court judges expressed a relatively optimistic view, 
with 54% saying the system will improve. 
</P>
<P>
Public defenders appear to be most pessimistic about the system's future, with 
70% saying that it will decline or stay the same in the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Much of their outlook may be influenced by the fact that public defenders 
rarely win cases and see their clients exonerated. The vast majority of the 
accused criminals they represent are convicted after agreeing to plead guilty 
in exchange for lesser sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Still, most public defenders surveyed -- as with a great majority of judges, 
prosecutors, police and probation officers, said they were generally satisfied 
with their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The question of how best to improve criminal justice in Los Angeles drew some 
consensus -- with exceptions -- among those within the system. 
</P>
<P>
Relatively few, for example, believe there is need for more prosecutors, 
tougher laws or programs to rehabilitate criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Is there need for more courts? Majorities of all groups surveyed and nearly 
half of probation officers agreed there is. 
</P>
<P>
What about additional jails? Most municipal court judges, prosecutors and 
police rated additional jail space as among the highest priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Would more police officers help? Only majorities of prosecutors and police 
officers themselves believe that bolstering the force would prove beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next 10 years, do you think the criminal justice system will improve 
in its ability to administer justice that is "swift and sure?"

A draft report on the planned Southern California commuter rail system predicts 
that 27 round-trip trains will carry 23,329 one-way passengers a day by the 
time all but one of the lines are operating in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The 88-page report prepared by the new Southern California Commuter Rail 
Coordinating Council, consisting of transportation officials from five 
Southland counties, also disclosed plans to extend service to such outlying 
points as Hemet and Redlands in what eventually will be 412 miles of lines and 
50 stations. 
</P>
<P>
The report said Moorpark-Los Angeles, Santa Clarita-Los Angeles and San 
Bernardino-Los Angeles service would begin in 1992, Oceanside-Los Angeles 
service in 1993 and San Bernardino/Riverside-Irvine, Riverside-Los Angeles and 
Hemet-Riverside service in 1995. It said no start-up date is yet available for 
Redlands-San Bernardino service. 
</P>
<P>
"The total estimated cost of right of way improvements, stations, rolling stock 
and shared facilities needed for start-up level of service is estimated at $582 
million," said the report, presented by Fred Reagan, executive director of the 
Riverside County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
It estimated that initial annual operating costs would range between $19 
million and $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
As the report was submitted this week, it was disclosed that the state 
transportation commission is urging Southern California counties to defer 
purchase of Canadian-built bi-level commuter rail cars until Caltrans adopts 
performance specifications for such cars in April. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission approved the purchase of 40 of 
the 162-seat cars from the UTDC firm of Kingston, Canada, last month, with 
delivery set for 1992. But no final purchase agreement has yet been signed. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Peterson, the executive director of the Los Angeles commission, expressed 
some impatience with the calls for delay, saying in an interview: "I can 
understand how some people would be upset that we were prejudging the results 
of their work (adopting the specifications). But are they moving in every way 
aggressively to get service to the public?" 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said he is confident that the Canadian cars will meet the 
specifications that the state eventually adopts. 
</P>
<P>
The commuter rail planning report, meanwhile, said it would be critical to 
provide adequate park-and-ride lots and connecting bus or light-rail services 
at the stations along the lines to get the highest possible patronage. 
</P>
<P>
But in sketching financial details, the report said it would be up to local 
governments along the way to foot the entire bill for station development. 
</P>
<P>
It estimated capital costs for starting service to be $85.9 million for the 
Moorpark-Los Angeles line, $51.8 million for Santa Clarita-Los Angeles, $115.2 
million for San Bernardino-Los Angeles, $121.4 million for San 
Bernardino/Riverside-Irvine, $54.4 million for Riverside-Los Angeles, $50.3 
million for Hemet-Riverside and $103 million for Oceanside-Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the projected commuter lines now carry Amtrak intercity service, 
which would continue. Between Los Angeles and San Bernardino, there remains a 
choice to be made between two alternate routes. 
</P>
<P>
The report said the most significant long-range technology issue affecting 
commuter rail development is the possible electrification of the lines. It said 
electrification would allow higher speeds and stem pollution, but also would 
entail major capital investments, which were not specified. 
</P>
<P>
The report also recommended that the system have "a single management 
structure" and allow for the common use of equipment and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Service should be provided by a single operator and passengers would be able 
to purchase a single ticket allowing transfer to other routes within the system 
and to connecting transit services," it went on. "Service schedules would be 
coordinated and there would be a unified fare structure and an integrated 
passenger information system." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside and Ventura counties are in the 
process of forming a joint authority to administer the network, and San Diego 
County may be affiliated in a limited way, said Dana Reed, chairman of the 
coordinating council.

PAN AM SAYS IT MIGHT AGREE TO A TWA MERGER;

<P>
Bringing two of the nation's sickliest airlines a step closer to combining 
forces, Pan American World Airways said Friday that it might agree to a merger 
with Trans World Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Carl C. Icahn, chairman of TWA, Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. 
Plaskett said his airline's board of directors had decided such a combination 
would be "advantageous" to its shareholders and 27,800 employees. 
</P>
<P>
But Plaskett insisted that TWA would have to help Pan Am meet its dire cash 
needs during the first three months of the new year, traditionally the 
carrier's slowest season. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, it would be futile to enter into a transaction 
without provision for bridge financing, especially if TWA were not to commit to 
close the transaction regardless of our financial situation," Plaskett said in 
his letter. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn made his $375-million offer for Pan Am on Sunday, his second pitch to 
merge the nation's two leading transatlantic carriers in a month. 
</P>
<P>
Both TWA and Pan Am have been struggling for years; together they are $3.6 
billion in debt. And each has moved recently to sell its valuable London 
routes: Pan Am to United Airlines for $400 million and TWA to American Airlines 
for $515 million. 
</P>
<P>
Those deals, crucial for Pan Am's and TWA's survival, hang on talks between the 
U.S. and British governments over landing rights at London's Heathrow Airport 
-- talks that stalled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
On receipt of Plaskett's letter, Icahn immediately sent a memo to all TWA 
employees that read: "I view the response of Pan Am as a sufficient basis for 
continuing to evaluate financing and a merger possibility and we are in the 
process of doing so." 
</P>
<P>
Sources said TWA would need help from banks to provide the bridge financing, a 
sum that exceed $100 million. Icahn would probably insist in any loan 
arrangement on a pact that would make him a so-called debtor-in-possession. 
That would give him a priority claim on assets if Pan Am filed for bankruptcy, 
as some observers expect is unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
But most analysts believe that Icahn will prove neither able nor willing to 
come up with interim financing -- and thus that the merger will never 
transpire. 
</P>
<P>
"No one in their right mind is going to advance Pan Am any meaningful amount of 
money unless they are absolutely certain that Pan Am will not go into Chapter 
11 bankruptcy," said John V. Pincavage, an airline analyst with the 
Transportation Group, an affiliate of the Paine Webber investment house. 
</P>
<P>
In a bankruptcy, he explained, a judge might cancel a merger deal "or throw the 
money into the pot that would be set aside for the creditors" -- not for the 
interim lender. 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst, who declined to be identified because the situation is so 
"delicate," said: "Plaskett is not enamored with the deal but he needs the 
bucks." 
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, it is not a combination that solves any problems" for the two 
embattled carriers, the analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
"They will have the ability to sell their duplicate route authorities, but 
that's the only advantage," he said. "But otherwise there are major problems: 
The separate labor groups must be integrated, both airlines have old airplanes 
and there are greatly underfunded pension funds at both carriers." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Morton S. Bayer, chairman of Avmark, Inc., an Arlington, Va., aviation 
consulting firm, said the combination would be favorable. "There are definite 
strengths," he said. "They have the capability of greatly increasing their 
domestic feed of traffic into overseas routes. And they have numerous dormant 
overseas routes that they could activate."

RALPHS ARRANGES FINANCING TO ADD 50 STORES BY 1994; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: THE NEW CREDIT PACT WILL MAKE THE GROCERY CHAIN A STRONGER 
COMPETITOR AND FREE MORE THAN $100 MILLION IN CAPITAL IN THE FIRST THREE YEARS 
BY STRETCHING OUT DEBT PAYMENTS.

Ralphs Grocery Co. on Friday announced an ambitious program to open 50 new 
stores by the end of 1994, and said it obtained up to $450 million in new 
financing to replace existing long-term debt and to free capital for the 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Alan J. Reed, chief financial officer of the Compton-based supermarket chain, 
said the new financing through Security Pacific National Bank would cut annual 
long-term debt payments that are now about $50 million a year. He declined to 
specify the amount to be cut, but said the new financing would free more than 
$100 million in capital in the first three years. 
</P>
<P>
"This Security Pacific package allows for the necessary flexibility to complete 
the aggressive capital expansion program that we have begun," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the refinancing was another sign that Ralphs is financially 
strong, despite being saddled with debt after it became part of the Campeau 
retailing empire in the takeover of Ralphs' parent, Federated Stores Inc., in 
1988. Ralphs is operated as a separate corporation from the rest of the 
troubled Campeau holdings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably more appropriate for Security Pacific to be borrowing money from 
Ralphs," joked retail consultant Tom Pirko, alluding to the bank's recent 
announcement that it expected to lose as much as $360 million in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion plans were also seen as a necessary step to counter competition 
from archrivals Vons and Lucky Stores. Both have expanded recently through 
acquisitions and mergers with other supermarket chains; Ralphs has lagged 
behind partly because much of its cash flow was going toward heavy debt 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
"In a market as competitive as you have there, doing nothing is not an option," 
said Michael Sansolo, editor of Progressive Grocer, a trade publication based 
in Stamford, Conn. "By doing this, it seems Ralphs is positioning itself to 
keep growing with the market." 
</P>
<P>
Under its new plans, the 148-store Ralphs chain will add 50 new stores 
throughout the six counties of Southern California, including stores in 
southern Orange County and in new planned communities along Highway 15 in the 
Temecula Valley of north San Diego County, said Jan Charles Gray, a Ralphs 
senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion also includes building an automated distribution warehouse for 
perishable goods in Compton, to replace two warehouses in Los Angeles, in late 
1992 or early 1993, he said.

The expansion will mean the addition of about 5,000 to 6,000 new employees to 
Ralphs current work force of more than 17,000. It will also mean the expansion 
of total sales from less than $3 billion now to about $5 billion by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what this signals for a lot of their competitors is that a real strong 
competitor just got a lot stronger," said Richard Giss, a partner in charge of 
the retail services group at the accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said the new financing package, which is expected to be in place by April, 
will include a private placement of debt up to $200 million, a long-term loan 
of $150 million and a revolving credit line of up to $100 million. The total 
package will replace about $430 million of current senior debt now with Bankers 
Trust, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs reported a loss of $11.4 million in the quarter ended Oct. 7 on sales of 
$623.5 million, but its cash flow for the period was a healthy $44 million. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion would move Ralphs closer to its rivals. Gray said Ralphs is 
currently the No. 3 supermarket chain in Southern California, behind Vons and 
Lucky.

MERCK DISCLOSES HUMAN TESTS OF 2 AIDS DRUGS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: THE COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INHIBIT HIV IN THE TEST TUBE. THE 
TRIALS ARE TO DETERMINE TOLERABILITY AND SAFETY IN PEOPLE.

<P>
Merck &amp; Co., the world's largest pharmaceuticals company, has begun 
preliminary human testing of two closely related potential compounds for use 
against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Merck, which is traditionally tight-lipped about drugs so early in the testing 
process, acknowledged the trials in response to inquiries from investors, Linda 
Distlerath, senior director of science and technology policy, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Merck closed at 
$87.625, up $1.50 on volume of 1.7 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The drugs -- known internally by Merck as L-697,639 and L-697,661 -- are 
members of a class known as reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Reverse 
transcriptase is an enzyme that is crucial to the reproduction and growth of 
HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that is believed to cause AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Our scientists came upon these drugs after screening some 23,000 other 
compounds against HIV," Distlerath said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the drugs were sped from the test tube to humans in a bit more than 
six months -- most drugs take two years -- Distlerath cautioned that four of 
five drugs at this stage of research fail. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary human tests, known as Phase I trials, are being conducted at an 
undisclosed site in Europe and began this week at the National Institutes of 
Health in Bethesda, Md. Phase I studies are designed to determine the safety, 
tolerability and absorption of potential compounds. 
</P>
<P>
The compounds have already been shown effective against HIV in test tubes and 
in cultured human cells, and nontoxic in rats and monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
Margo Warren, a spokeswoman for the NIH, said 40 HIV-infected individuals 
without symptoms have been entered into the study. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Delaney, executive director of Project Inform, a patient advocacy group 
in San Francisco, said he is "encouraged that a company with the resources of 
Merck is choosing to work in this field." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he added, "we've all learned to be cautious about new drugs this early 
in the research cycle." 
</P>
<P>
Merck, of Rahway, N.J., is also a contender, along with SmithKline, Upjohn, and 
Hoffman-LaRoche, in the race to develop another class of antivirals, known as 
protease inhibitors, for use against HIV. And Janssen Pharmaceuticals is 
developing another class of anti-HIV agents known as TIBO derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs-Wellcome's drug AZT, the only compound licensed for use against HIV, 
also interferes with reverse transcriptase but in a significantly different 
manner from the new Merck compounds. DDI and DDC, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb 
and Hoffman, respectively, are chemical cousins of AZT.

GENENTECH GETS OK ON DRUG FOR IMMUNE ILLNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Genentech said Friday that it received Federal Food and Drug Administration 
approval to market a genetically engineered drug to fight chronic granulomatous 
disease, a rare, inherited disorder of the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, Actimmune, is a form of interferon gamma and is the first approval in 
the United States of a interferon gamma product. It is Genentech's third 
approval of a recombinant drug that it will market itself. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech developed Actimmune under the Orphan Drug Act, which will give it 
exclusive rights to market it for this particular disease for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The company used the announcement of the approval as an opportunity to reaffirm 
its support for act. 
</P>
<P>
Although President Bush earlier this year vetoed one bill that would have 
altered the act, Genentech expects additional challenges to the law. 
</P>
<P>
Actimmune marketed for this disease won't be a blockbuster for the South San 
Francisco-based company -- although it hopes other proposed uses of interferon 
gamma will prove important sources of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
But for as many as 400 children across the country who suffer from chronic 
granulomatous disease, the FDA approval means they have a better chance of 
making it to adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
This rare immune system disorder used to be called "deadly granulomatous" 
because it so often claimed children before they reached age 12. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Hudson, a 13-year-old with the disease, will spend Christmas at home in 
Prospect, Ore., this year. Just this week, he went snow tubing for the first 
time. These ordinary events have special meaning to Larry's parents, Laqueta 
and Daniel Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
Laqueta Hudson perhaps makes the case for continued support of the drug act 
more elegantly than the company could. "This is a real blessing to have this 
drug," she said. "We're not living in terror anymore" and waiting for the next 
infection to strike. 
</P>
<P>
Larry is one of many children who have received the drug as part of clinical 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
He gets injections three times a week, which he says he doesn't like and tries 
to put off. 
</P>
<P>
But even that is better, he readily admits, than going through the hassles and 
pains of previous drugs and treatment. And especially, the infections. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Larry was in the hospital for two months -- including Christmas 
-- recovering from surgery to remove a large growth on his brain and to treat 
many small tumor-like formations in his lung, both caused by the disease. 
</P>
<P>
For many parents, the treatment costs have been devastating, especially 
because, as an inherited disease, it often afflicts more than one child in a 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Curnutte, an expert in the disease who conducted trials of Actimmune 
through Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, said that in trials 
of the drug, there was a 70% decline in the number of serious infections and 
that patients spent only one-third the usual number of days in hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In Hobbs, N.M., two of the three children of Jeannene and Lenard Wagner have 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Having the drug approved is "an excellent Christmas present," said Jeannene 
Wagner.

UNOCAL TO HIKE OUTPUT AT PLANT IN WILMINGTON

<P>
Unocal Corp. said Friday that it will spend $515 million to increase gasoline 
production at its Wilmington refinery and upgrade equipment to meet new federal 
clean air standards. 
</P>
<P>
The project, to be completed in late 1993 -- subject to regulatory approvals -- 
would boost current gasoline production by about 10% over the current level of 
roughly 80,000 barrels a day, said Unocal spokesman Barry Lane. 
</P>
<P>
It will enable Unocal to produce reformulated gasolines, designed to produce 
lower auto emissions under guidelines to be established pursuant to the federal 
Clean Air Act signed by President Bush last month. 
</P>
<P>
The project will also reduce sulfur oxide emissions from the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal will build a 55,000-barrel-per-day processing unit used in making 
gasoline, a hydrogen plant and related sulfur recovery units. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed upgrade will require permits from the city of Los Angeles and the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal will finance the upgrade out of internal funds. 
</P>
<P>
The refinery has a capacity to process up to 108,000 barrels of crude oil a day 
into such products as gasoline and fuel oil.

ARCO PLANS OIL DEALS WITH 2 REGIONAL SOVIET COUNCILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield Co., undeterred by growing political tension in the Soviet 
Union, said Friday that it has agreed to negotiate a joint oil exploration 
venture with two local Soviet governments. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles oil company said he agreement, signed last week, was the result 
of year-long discussions with the regional councils of Magadan and of the 
Chukotka Autonomous Area, both in the northeastern corner of the Soviet Union, 
across the Bering Sea from Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Any final agreement between Arco and the regional councils would also need 
approval from the Russian Federation and Soviet central government in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The Arco announcement came as the sudden resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze increased political uncertainty in the Soviet Union. 
Shevardnadze's departure raised concerns about the possible emergence of a 
dictatorship, or some other political shift. 
</P>
<P>
Though Arco declined to comment, oil industry analysts expect some U.S. energy 
companies to delay plans with the Soviets in light of the new uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it delays everything," said John Lichtblau, president of the 
Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "One of the problems they have with 
making deals over there is that they didn't know how reliable their partner 
was, who their partner was." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil producer, but its industry has 
fallen on hard times after peaking at 12.5 million barrels of crude oil 
production daily in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Lichtblau said Soviet production has now dropped to 11.3 million barrels a day. 
It is expected to drop even lower over the next several years unless the 
Soviets receive technological assistance from the West. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear how much new oil could be found in the Soviet Union, although 
some experts say higher production could easily equal that of a moderate-sized 
member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, none of the major oil companies has gone beyond signing agreements 
that commit them to negotiate the possibility of a joint venture, similar to 
the pact announced by Arco. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say Chevron might be the closest to getting a final deal with the 
Soviets. It is eyeing the large Tengiz oil field in the northeast Caspian Sea 
region, which the Soviets have estimated could contain 25 billion barrels of 
oil.

Energy Plans Pitched to Bush: Administration officials at odds over energy 
conservation met with President Bush, trying to sway him on alternative car 
fuels and other possible ingredients of his national energy strategy. Energy 
Secretary James D. Watkins, who made a presentation at the meeting of Bush's 
Economic Policy Council, is recommending that the strategy include both 
increased fuel efficiency standards and a requirement for greater use of 
non-gasoline fuels. But other advisers, including White House Chief of Staff 
John H. Sununu, are fighting the proposals on grounds that they would be costly 
and involve excessive government regulation.

Pru-Bache Says It Expects Big Loss: Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. will lose 
$250 million this year as it gets out of several costly businesses, according 
to its parent company. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the loss was bigger than expected. Perrin Long, a brokerage 
analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities, noted that part of the loss was 
because of a restructuring charge, which Prudential did not specify. He said 
the brokerage had lost $250 million in two problem areas: merchant banking and 
risk arbitrage. Any other profits were wiped out by the restructuring charge, 
he said.

PR FIRM WILL ASSIST L.A. CURBSIDE RECYCLING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 3-year-old public relations agency known for its socially conscious campaigns 
will take the lead in publicizing the city of Los Angeles' new curbside 
recycling program, which will be the world's largest. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood-based Laufer Associates has been awarded $1.6 million by the City 
Council to explain the system to residents using direct-mail brochures, a 
user's manual, print advertising, billboards, TV and radio spots, and such 
reminders as refrigerator magnets, all of which will be phased-in neighborhood 
by neighborhood by late next year or in early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Laufer will direct three other agencies to tailor its message for specific 
groups: Foote, Cone &amp; Belding/Los Angeles, for advertising and direct mail; 
Coronado Communications, which specializes in the Latino and Asian-Pacific 
communities, and Lois Hill Hale &amp; Associates, which has experience in black 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Most materials will be multilingual, said Jessica Laufer, president of Laufer 
Associates. Toll-free messages to explain the recycling and waste-reduction 
effort will also be available in about 10 languages.
